2989087,5,B000WPJT6O,"A wonderful film!

While most modern political documentaries have an agenda, this film does not. Instead it shows the true shades of gray to be found in any relationship between a politician and those he works with.

Is Buddy a crook, a hero, an honest enabler of crooked men? This film had me answering ""all of the above"", and it did so without trying to force that answer upon me. Whatever you may know, or not know, of Buddy Cianci or his politics you will find him, and this film, captivating.

James Woods narration is very unforced, and does not attempt to sway you one way or the other - and the level of access that Buddy granted the director is surprising. While some may find it a weakness for a film to not take a clear position, the point of this film seems to be that there is no clear position to take - and that is what makes it all the more engrossing.",1192665600,9,868,4.248484848484848

The movie has lots of humor, suspense, colorful characters and surprise twists that keep you enthralled.

2989091,3,B000WPJT6O,"This documentary is worth viewing and fairly entertaining. It gives Buddy overall a fair shake. I wish there were more interviews/commentary from non Brown University folks since those dominate the film and are more negative on his overall impact on the city. Elitists!
Buddy is far from a saint but sadly with how politics goes in corrupt states at least this guy provided value to the people.
James Woods (from RI) is perfect as narrator. The bonus interview of Buddy post prison and the old bonus film on his early career are better than the film.
With what is going on in IL and other states I bet none of those corrupt politicians ever did 1/4 of the good Mr Cianci did.
Bottom line (and this movie agrees)Providence was a dump before him and since he was taken down the city is slowly going back in the wrong direction. Love him or hate him you can't view this and not see the man as he truly is. A hard working man who loves Providence and power. I remember one night many years ago after 2AM near the PPac seeing Buddy get out of his limo inspecting an area that needed road repair. I said hello Mayor and of course he aknowledged me.
Like all of us we do good and bad (yes I mean you self rightous types especially)and Buddy's good side far outweighs the negatives.
I hope they do a real movie on Buddy based on the book Prince Of Providence. Buddy's quotes in the first 2/3rds of the book are Classic. Both funny and a true touch of reality.

2989094,5,B000WPJT6O,"Filmmaker Cherry Arnold's debut, award-winning documentary feature, ""Buddy"", is as striking in variety and interest as her compelling subject, Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci.

Despite having been found guilty of organizing a criminal enterprise out of Providence City Hall, a survey found that mayor Cianci's approval ratings actually rose. Arnold's work brings to a larger audience's attention how this came to pass by revealing the dynamics between Providence and its sometimes good, sometimes bad mayor of 26 years.

In this full and well-rounded portrait of Cianci, Arnold addresses the paradox that is Buddy -- how he became synonymous with the city, and how despite the extent of his sins, he was viewed favorably by a majority of people. Arnold succeeds in conveying that there is a wider set of social values characteristic of the society reflected in Cianci's image.

In a synthetic film style that effectively combines archival sources, interviews, records, and the events as they unfold, Arnold uncovers the classic dilemma endemic in our political culture: how to seize opportunities without losing the original relationship between the means and the ends. Cianci started out upholding tradition and law, but as his charismatic authority grows, it ultimately contributes to his demise.

We witness Cianci employ populist tactics to mend the fragmentation of a broken system, foster collaboration among disparate groups, organize for civic agency, and ultimately help fix the rampant blight of a decaying nowhere city. Armed with a sharp intellect, quick wit, non-rhotic accent and ever-evolving toupee (which he later dubbed ""the squirrel""), Cianci endeared himself to the masses, tirelessly toiling on their behalf.

Interspersed in the presentation of Cianci's good deeds and affable nature, Arnold manages to convey a growing sensation of curiosity and suspense. As the film progresses, there is an increasingly menacing, haunting quality achieved through skillful editing befitting to the mood and style of the subject. Arnold's pacing is masterful and James Wood's narration compelling.

If you are unfamiliar with the rise and fall of America's most notorious mayor, or well versed in Providence politics, you owe it to yourself to see this astonishing documentary produced, written and directed by Cherry Arnold.",1210464000,4,2323,5.529577464788733
2989095,4,B000WPJT6O,"This is a very satisfying documentary with more than local appeal. It is something of Greek tragedy that leaves us asking: what is it that generates a political animal like Buddy Cianci, a highly intelligent, talented politician, who took on the machine and beat it only to be swallowed up by his own hubris? You want Buddy to emerge a hero, but in the end are seriously disappointed by him. Narrator, James Woods, who has played more than the odd seedy character in his long, distinguished career, grew up in Rhode Island and no doubt appreciated the cadences surrounding Buddy's rapid rise and eventual disgrace. He presents the narrative in a very engaging way. In the end, you are left to make your own judgment about Buddy.

But Cherry Arnold's documentary goes far beyond the political into the personal machinations of a flawed man whose professional ambitions countered and ultimately contradicted the significant good he did for his beloved city of Providence, Rhode Island. Frame by frame this film never fails to fascinate. You will love Buddy the man as much as you will abhor many of his misdeeds. Even as you revile him you will cheer him on. Ultimately, you will pity him, but at the same time pray for his resurrection and redemption.",1196294400,2,623,4.831775700934579

2989099,5,B000WPJT6O,"I absolutely loved this movie!! It is very educational, entertaining, funny and well-balanced. Not only is this documentary a thorough telling of the long mayoral career of Buddy Cianci but also, of course, an examination of the great city that he represented for over two decades, Providence, Rhode Island.

Director Cherry Arnold has done a fine job of presenting the film in such a way that, I think, people not from New England or people not familiar with Buddy could easily follow and be thoroughly entertained by this film.

I've always liked Buddy Cianci and have followed his career for a while, and as a native Rhode Islander, it's been enjoyable to watch Providence, over the years, transform from a pretty rundown, slightly depressing place to a vibrant, exciting, dynamic destination.

I saw this film at two Rhode Island film festivals over recent years, obviously loved it and then eagerly awaited its release on DVD. The DVD was pushed back a few times, but now it's finally coming out, and my wife and I are incredibly psyched. We're so excited that, even though we recently moved to New York state, we're making a trek to Providence in a few days for the DVD's release party, and we can't wait!!

If you're a fan of well-made, informative, engrossing documentaries, or you have an interest in larger-than-life characters, history, urban politics and/or urban renewal, then you'll love this film and should purchase it. It would make a fine addition to any DVD library, and Cherry Arnold and her staff deserve your support for the outstanding document they painstakingly and lovingly have created.",1192752000,14,1613,4.962962962962963

8224940,5,B000WPJT6O,"I grew-up and lived in Rhode Island (until 1999), but not in Providence.  That said, nobody who lived in RI went untouched by the impact of Buddy.  He became a rising star in the Republican Party in the mid/late 70s, which eventually led him to run for governor in 1980.  He was even a speaker at the 1976 Republican convention.  He was known for his very personal approach -- Buddy was friendly with EVERYONE that wasn't a political opponent.  He was extremely popular with the common people & many of the voters of Providence (and Rhode Island).

Buddy loved to attend local parades, weddings, neighborhood events, and backyard barbecues.  I remember working at a fundraising event for a volunteer fire department in southern RI in the late 70s -- I believe it was a seafood festival.  Although the event was well outside of the voting region for Providence, Buddy arrived at the event in a helicopter to rub elbows with the locals.  He spent about an hour shaking hands and socializing with everyone, and sampling the food.  It's hard not to be drawn to someone that charismatic.

The DVD did a great job of capturing the essence of Buddy Cianci.  While there is no doubt that he ran a corrupt administration and did some very questionable things; there is also no denying the positive impact that he had on RI's capital city of Rhode Island.  Love him or hate him, he turned Providence into a thriving arts and tourist center.  I'm sure that the city of Hartford (in the neighboring state of CT) was envious of the dramatic positive impact that he had on Providence.

I really enjoyed the DVD and highly recommend it to anyone who came from Rhode Island, still live in RI, or just want to understand what it's like to be a ""Rhode Islander"".",1421193600,,1744,4.616883116883117
