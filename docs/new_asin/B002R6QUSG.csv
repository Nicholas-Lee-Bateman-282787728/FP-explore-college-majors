4714103,2,B002R6QUSG,"I tried the dances in this DVD several times and ended up very frustrated. I wanted to be able to get a good work out and spice up my dance moves. From the previous reviews, I thought I'd for sure learn some hot moves and actually get SOME instruction on it. While the dances are hot and give you a work out if you've got previous experience in dance instruction - the so-called ""step by step"" instructions are NOT instructions. They just cut each routine into fast-moving segments. One of the dancers does a quick demo, while Andrea gives you general ""pop, turn, twirl"" descriptions of each move. It's definitely not for beginners, like it claims to be. In summary, while the dancers are great, the instructions are NOT there. You will not learn anything nor get a work out because you will end up frustrated at the fast speed everything is shown. My literal reaction was ""that's it?"" where I then rewinded the segment to make sure there were no ""hidden"" segments. The previous reviews were very skewed and biased, and based on how much detail they give, it's obvious that it's probably from the maker and/or their friends, not your average consumer like myself.",1251244800,3,1163,4.650485436893204
4714104,5,B002R6QUSG,"I have bought so many workout DVDs, and this is by far THE BEST I have ever bought because it has EVERYTHING a workout video needs.  It has step-by-step instructions for each of the workouts.  The dance music is hip and great.  The dances are sexy and fun.  In addition, the workouts here require you to move ALL OF YOUR BODY and keep your heart rate at the target zone AT ALL TIME!!  You can tell that they actually spent a lot of time choreographing the dances and making this DVD.  Everything is done by the very professionals instead of just some sexy/party girls dancing together in a basement.  I am sure that many of you who have bought many workout videos will know what I am talking about.  Most of the weight loss workouts are not fun or sexy, and most of the sexy workouts won't speed up your heart rate enough to lose weight.  If you want a dance workout DVD with everything: that is fun, hip, and sexy; has nice music; teaches you how to dance; and helps you lose weight; this is the number one DVD that I will recommend.  I think Andrea needs to put out more dance/workout DVDs.",1248134400,9,1092,4.3088235294117645
4714105,5,B002R6QUSG,"This dvd is TOO much fun to be believed. The fat is trimmed! No blabbing, no wasted time, just hit play and go! Ever wanted to be Britney Spears? I mean, damn, I know I always thought I'd be awesome in my own video. I'm sure you do too.

This workout is like going to the set and shooting your own video. 'Dance a go go' makes you feel like you are doing an entire routine from a Britney Spears video. Sorry to keep saying Britney Spears, but that's what it's like.

It's wicked-fun, for a few reasons...

1) The moves are sexy but not highly complex
2) There's tons of moves!
3) The moves usually repeat four times in a row before changing which gives a great continuity to the dance (meaning: lets you get the physical memory of how it's preformed before they move on)
4) The moves aren't lame or too slow so you get bored, or too fast, so you can't keep up!
5) You do a routine to a whole song, not 45 seconds of it like most 'dance dvds'. And there are three distinctly different routines, and she breaks down the moves, too, if you need that. Honestly, most of them you should be just able to jump right in and dance your bum off too without the breakdown.

It's sexy, hot, fun, FEELS like dancing, is dancing, changes up enough so that you don't feel bored ever, is edgy, rocking, and, again, most importantly DOABLE by any average person.

And don't you look sexy doing it! -- and actually succeeding! You know how too-complex dance dvds are: fun to watch but never get used. This is the opposite of that! You'll definately do this when you want to really dance!

The video stresses your own personal style not freaking out if you're 100% perfect. No problem! Just dance!

MTV, here you come...

Love it, thank you, Andrea! I'm waiting on your visionary part 2~! It's sure to rock!",1229126400,7,1788,4.316417910447761
4714106,1,B002R6QUSG,This is just some half naked girls dancing. don't tell you how to do the moves or slow down so you can see the moves. trust me don't buy it is very misleading it is crap.,1291161600,5,170,3.75
4714107,3,B002R6QUSG,"I just got this DVD a few days ago! I was so excited about it because I really Loeved the trailer.
But almost all of my expectations were ruined by the actual product...
First - there's no actual movement break down, so it's really hard to get what to do if you are not professionally trained.
Second - the quality of the video is poor. For the money you pay, you expect it to be good. I've just tried it on my laptop, and even on this small screen it looks blury

In general, this DVDs are fine...but...the trailer is MUCH MORE BETTER
so you'll get a nice dvd but do not expect the ""trailer quality""",1281744000,3,600,4.172413793103448
4714108,3,B002R6QUSG,"I really wish they broke all the moves down more. She does each move once and expects you to have it when you don't, so you're forced to keep going back and going back and doing it over and over again. All in all the ""move breakdown"" is about seven minutes long...about as long as the actual dance. It'll take me about a month to learn just one dance. I did the dance four times today and I still don't have it. I did break a sweat trying to keep up though. When I finally learn the dances I'll be happy and I'll like the video much more...it's just gonna take a really long time. However, I think the option where you can watch it from behind is cool.",1277769600,,652,4.062015503875969
4714109,3,B002R6QUSG,"This is a box set of the music video dance workout, latin groove dance workout, and nightclub fun workout. There is a section where each dance section is broken down at half pace, then double pace, then all the dance parts are put together. There is no instruction of how to do the moves, so you will probably flail around a little ridiculously until you can get the moves down. It will depend on how familiar you are with dance. My advice is just keep going until you get it. Everything takes practice to get good. The actual workout time is pretty short, I like to do it on a day I am going to do something else too. I'm not sorry I bought this box set, but it probably won't be my favorite workout. I do love to dance, and this is a good way to learn a new style of dancing.",1268784000,5,777,4.084967320261438
4714110,3,B002R6QUSG,"I agree with everyone who posted comments here so far--andrea is sexy, inspiring, and a GREAT DANCER!

despite my love for andrea and her cool choreography, this video is a waste of money.  it's ONLY SEVEN MINUTES LONG.  those seven minutes are AWESOME, i'm not gonna lie, but 7 minutes?  no.  not worth it.  although andrea is awesome, this isn't a workout video.  it's just a dance.  and the instructions to the moves are NOT HELPFUL!  :(

if this video was say, 45 minutes, it'd be the best dance video ever!!!",1266451200,,513,4.538461538461538
4714111,3,B002R6QUSG,"I just bought this video recently after buying the GoGo Dancing with KT video. I am kinda disappointed in this one though. They only show you moves to ONE hip hop song. The moves they show you is for their routine they made up for that one song, but they don't break the moves down at all. All they do is tell you the name of the move, do it once really fast, and then move on to the next move..absolutly NO breakdown.

 I had to put it on slow motion to try to figure out what the hell they are doing and i still can't figure some of them out. Instructional videos should actually show you how to perform the moves not just show you what the moves are.",1261612800,,653,4.015384615384615
4714112,1,B002R6QUSG,"I was so wrong attracted by the trailer. It was nothing special and the move breakdown is very lame. So fast that you can't learn any move. The music is also very lame. Anyway, don't waste your money!",1258588800,,200,4.2894736842105265
4714113,3,B002R6QUSG,"I am a person who do exercise about 3 times a week and love to dance. I was trained when I was very young so I do have some basic on dancing. In the past 2 years, I have bought over 10 fitness DVDs so I know a little bit of what a good workout DVD should be. After trying this DVD, the moves were not so complicated, the production was great, music was ok but I am a bit frustating that there were little instructions. They did provide some breakdown of the moves but Andrea only counted 1,2,3,4.... with a woman showing the move that had given no further learning at all. If she was going to only count, I can freeze my DVD and learn the moves myself. After all this is a workout DVD and at least we should get some instructions and tips. Be aware that during the workout there were no voice of Andrea. They replaced that by showing on the screen what was the next move. So you would better master the moves before you start the workout. At some point, I was thinking that this DVD was produced for men by the way she talked and dressed. I'm not hating this DVD but not loving it.",1258588800,,1081,4.07981220657277
4714114,3,B002R6QUSG,"This had the potential to be one of the best dvds ever. except for one little problem,...THE WORKOUT IS ONLY 7 MINUTES LONG! And apparently its like that on all of the dvds in this series. There is a bunch of extras on the dvds. All kinds of advice from Andrea Lin such as how to dress and good posture and what not. But when it comes down to it. This isn't really a workout video. I put it on last night ready to workout. Then after 7 minutes it was over. I sat there like a moron thinking that there was something wrong with my dvd. Then I read the back and it said 7 mins of workout! Who in Gods name would spend $20 on a 7 minute workout dvd?",1258588800,7,646,3.9015151515151514

When I received the ""new one"" it still did not work. The second one I received was not even sealed. I had to pay to send it back twice and then got a refund that covered the price of the DVD but not shipping.",1350777600,,386,3.6626506024096384
8476360,2,B002R6QUSG,There could have been more instructions as the moves were so fast it was hard to follow.  The dance moves should be slower so you can watch and do them easier.,1347321600,,159,4.129032258064516
8476361,2,B002R6QUSG,"I got this video to improve my dance style so I was really bummed to see that the video is just 6 hot girls dancing for 7 minutes each. Don't buy this if you want to learn new dance moves, however if you are into watching a group of girls dance for 20 minutes then go right ahead/",1326412800,,280,3.8448275862068964
8476362,5,B002R6QUSG,"I find the dancing to be imaginative. And the moves make for a great workout. The instructions are brief, which some people may find frustrating. But you can always review them in slo-mo, and I prefer that to wasting time with overly detailed tedious instructions. I like the video backdrop with the abandoned warehouse style. I don't care for the pseudo-vintage clip that precedes each dance piece, but that's a matter of taste.",1324166400,,429,4.890410958904109
8476363,1,B002R6QUSG,"very disappointed with this CD. basically it has pretty much the same stuff from their very first DVD and I spent more money on this one hoping there are new stuff in it since I like her. but no, not much at all. very disappointed.",1307923200,2,231,4.155555555555556
8476364,4,B002R6QUSG,"This DVD is awesome.  Understand that anyone can probably do this stuff, but it's not easy.  It's challenging.  Unless you have dance experience, or have done the routines in this a million times and know it, you aren't going to get the best cardio workout AT FIRST because of the learning curve.  The dance breakdowns are not typical of what you would expect from most other dance aerobics dvds either.  Simply put it's not super easy.  Don't let this keep you from getting this sweet dance workout!!  This is what I do.  When I do my cardio I start out with my Crunch Cardio Dance Blast DVD.  It was pretty easy to learn, therefore it's easy to keep up with and keep your heart rate elevated for 40 minutes.  It's a great DVD.  When I'm done with that I put this Dance a GoGo DVD in to learn how to do these dances.  Since it's actually challenging to learn actual dance moves, I don't expect to get the best cardio workout from this DVD until I know what I'm doing.  Just like any other workout DVD.  Once I know how to do all these moves, it's gonna be a great cardio workout. It's hot, it's fun, the music is hot, and it's just as much a mind workout as a body workout.  I really want to learn and practice these routines cause they are super hot, and sooooo fun!!  So I'm not gonna give up on it because it's challenging, and I'm gonna make sure I still get a full on cardio dance workout elsewhere while I'm still learning how to do these routines.  It's a great addition if you actually want to learn how to dance.  Plus these moves are SUPER sexy and hot.  I totally can't wait to get this stuff down.  Don't let the HATERS keep you from buying this either.  Is it full of hot, half naked women working it?  Um yeah!!  I think they are inspiring!!  I'm not going to let jealousy take anything away from my experience with this or any workout/dance dvd.  Eventually if I keep it up, I know I can look forward to having a sleek dancers body like them.  I want it, so bring it!!  If you're afraid of working it and letting the sex kitten in you out, this probably isn't the best DVD for you.  Way cooler than Tracy Anderson method DVDs as well.  Those work too but are boring and the music doesn't make you want to dance at all.",1298246400,6,2234,4.215130023640662
8476365,4,B002R6QUSG,"As someone who has a drawer full of exercise videos, I have a few favorites that I use most often. The ones I choose have the least amount of instruction and talking since, after the first or second time through them, the talking is a distraction. I enjoyed the Dance a GoGo DVD because I like the music and choreography, it's a good aerobic workout and I can choose from three workouts. I particularly like that there is no instruction. I can see what the dancers do and do my best to imitate them. It's fun and a workout I will likely add to my list of favorites. Indeed, the dancers are quite sexy and sure to capture the attention of any man in the room.",1295222400,5,658,4.23015873015873
