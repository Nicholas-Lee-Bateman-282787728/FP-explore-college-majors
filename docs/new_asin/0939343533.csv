7793486,5,0939343533,"Need a good laugh? You will find outrageous humor in a Vegetarian's Nightmare. The whole DVD is priceless in its humor and in Baxter Black's twisted sense of cowboy humor and keen, perceptive observation of life on the ranch.

I was first introduced to this sense of humor with his book, Hey Cowboy,  Wanna Get Lucky? while living in Greeley. Practically rolled on the floor with laughter because it was so true and so funny. Great cowboy humor! This DVD lives up to that first encounter.

On the flip side, as a dog owner, I also found his ode to a dog--""Just a Dog""--to be right on the money when it comes to how a dog owner feels when their dog has passed. It is words straight from the heart. It brought many of my friends to tears (as well as myself); but, it is a very poignant tribute to all dogs who have given their hearts to their owners and vice versa. Get out the kleenex, toughen up but definitely listen.

Thanks, Baxter, for all the books, videos, and CDs. They brighten my day!",1352332800,3,993,4.351351351351352
7793487,2,0939343533,I am returning these DVD's.  There was no plastic wrap around the DVD container and both of the DVD's are scratched.  Not happy with this at all.,1348358400,3,145,4.333333333333333
