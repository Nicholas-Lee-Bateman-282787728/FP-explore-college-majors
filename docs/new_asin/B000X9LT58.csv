8227336,4,B000X9LT58,"The speaker has impeccable references as a Professor of Statistics and President of the American Statistical Association. She is author of a number of books on the subject, and many research papers evaluating the results of parapsychology investigations. The subject she presented to the International Remote Viewing Association Conference and recorded on this DVD gives an interesting account with some easy to understand statistical information. Not perhaps the clearest of lecturers, she was not helped by the lack of some facilities that should have been provided by the Association,  She had no laser pointer for diagram use, and the sound quality could have been improved. There was no microphone facility for the end of lecture questioners.  Despite these shortcomings, it was good to hear this valued lecturer in the flesh and to see her diagramatic evaluations, and I found this DVD to be a good purchase.",1453593600,,914,5.2534246575342465
