5049472,5,B007232CO0,"Powerful story about love, loyalty and war.  Great bravery, strong characters and good story line  with plenty of war time action.",1396742400,,130,5.142857142857143
5049473,3,B007232CO0,Not bad if you like war movies but could use more action. Weird love story in the middle with difficult mission at the end,1391212800,2,122,4.125
5049474,4,B007232CO0,"Yes is it corny, you betcha. But is it awesome, oh yeah!! Great addition to my collection. Scenes a bit hokey, but a good overall pick.",1389744000,,135,4.230769230769231
5049475,3,B007232CO0,"Rare movie on sea action in the Med and more rare on MTB. Good action ! Plot line like 633 Sqd.

Fun Sat movie.",1388793600,2,111,3.625
5049476,4,B007232CO0,"Although the plot is a little contrived, this movie is decent escapism in terms of WW2 fare.
Very few movies deal with Malta, so this was cool to see the island. Also rarely shown are the E-boats.",1376265600,3,196,4.324324324324325
5049477,4,B007232CO0,It was a good war movie that had plenty of action. the actors did a good job with their preformance. I would recommend it to war movie fans.,1371513600,,140,4.035714285714286
5049478,4,B007232CO0,I like it so much that I loan it to my friends. The action in this picture is terrific. I recomend it to everyone to wach it.,1360972800,,125,3.6666666666666665
5049479,4,B007232CO0,"The cover blurb is a bit misleading.  Franciscus plays an American volunteer with the Royal Navy who is a Motor Torpedo Boat captain.  After action in the Channel, he is selected to proceed to Malta under sealed orders.  He discovers he is to destroy an Italian submarine pen in Sicily being used by the Germans to store glide bombs being used against British convoys.  This is during the time that Rommel has driven as far East in Egypt as possible, and Malta is under siege.

Franciscus has to come up with his own workable plan of attack, which will probably be suicidal.  He has to gain the respect and cooperation of the MTB base, and make a recce behind the lines to get a handle on the objective.  There is a love triangle with the base commander and his wife which slows things down a bit, though.

I am not sure of the postwar type used, but I'm thinking that these may be Vosper Rescue and Towing Target Launches made up to look like MTB's and E-boats.  There's some model work as well.  However, if you want films more on torpedo boat tactics, They Were Expendable or PT-109 might be better bets.",1338163200,13,1107,4.435643564356436
8508709,2,B007232CO0,"James Franciscus looking a lot more like a very skinny, very tan, ""tennis pro"" than an American in Her Majesty's Royal Navy, stars in a very poorly done war film here that I would not recommend. Unlike some others, I don't really have a problem with him as an actor, but the movie itself stinks. ""Jimmy"" is put in charge of an MTB squadron (motor torpedo boat--PT Boat for us yanks), assigned to a dangerous mission against the Germans near the island of Malta which the British occupy. The battle scenes take place mostly between the British MTB's, and German E-Boats which are essentially the same as MTB's. All the battle scenes are ""cheesy"" and poorly done to say the least. In between Naval engagements, Jimmy runs around behind German lines gathering intel and getting local partisans helping him killed. When not engaged with the enemy, Jimmy is having a very strange relationship with his Commanding Officers Wife who we see ""flopping around"" naked in the sea shortly after Jimmy arrives in Malta. As someone who grew up on 60's War movies and still loves them, I'd like to tell you some redeeming thing about this film to make it worth your time watching; I can't, it's terrible.",1509926400,,1188,4.716346153846154
8508710,3,B007232CO0,"Well, it was fun to see British and German MTBs instead of American Icons, and the premise was about as good as Guns of Navarone without the budget, but the acting and dialog was pretty weak.",1475625600,,191,4.333333333333333

8508717,2,B007232CO0,Couldn't finish watching this one. Just didn't care for it. James Franciscus demonstrates pretty clearly why his only prominant turn as a leading man was as a cut rate charlton heston in Beneath the POTA - granted the script stunk too. Wanted to like this but couldn't,1429833600,,268,4.723404255319149
