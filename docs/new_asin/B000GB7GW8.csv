8130284,1,B000GB7GW8,"This is a near wonderful set of short vampire films cannibalized from existing films. There were some likable characters and a hospital machine that goes ping. The second film loved shooting the mike, they did so in at least two scenes.  Not worth watching film outtakes.

8130287,5,B000GB7GW8,"First of all, I thought this trilogy was great...I've been hearing alot of people saying that all 3 of these short stories are condenst versions of the subspecies movies....The first story in this trilogy is called *Spawn Of Hell* which is a shortened version of *Subspecies 4 Bloodstorm* the 3rd story is called *Undead evil* which is a shortened version of *Vampire Journals* but the second story Which is called *from the Grave* had nothing to do with any of the subspecies movies, Denise Duff does star in it and also produced and directed it, but plays a completly different character named *Victoria* where as the subspecies her characters name is michelle...so as for saying that every story in this trilogy is a take off of the subspecies movies is untrue, cause the only story that had anything to do with the subspeacies movies was *Spawn Of Hell* So so I give the trilogy 5 stars and the people that say that every story on here is subspecies related, obviously haven't watched it..",1310860800,4,993,4.745664739884393
8130288,1,B000GB7GW8,"The description isn't well, very descriptive of what the movie is.  Its actually clips of 3 different movies with the same female actress.  And they DO NOT fit at all.  It actually gives you a glimpse of the actual movies but heck come on we can just have all three and watch them back to back.  Defiantly not happy with this movie.",1307145600,,332,4.306451612903226
8130289,1,B000GB7GW8,"This trilogy appears to have been almost randomly created from the Subspecies Bloodstone movies. It makes no sense unless one has seen prior films.

Kudos to the editor for the more than a minute long scene in the bedroom with the microphone hanging between the two actors. Even Ed Wood would have caught that one.",1287446400,,314,4.709090909090909
8130290,2,B000GB7GW8,"First of all, if these were to have been new movies.  It would of been cool.  Just so you don't get tricked, if you don't know, these movies (except the one with the actress (duff, a prior full moon actress) were just exerpts from the subscies movies and vampire journals, which was also a full moon production.  So, with anticipation I purchased it, and I was totally let down by it.  But, if you don't have the full moon compilacion of subspecies and the other story where (Duff, produced and co wrote) its a fair triology to watch.  The advantage of having the full series of subspecies, is that it tells the whole story.  As well as the other one in it.  These are literally watered down short versions.....",1170374400,13,711,4.465116279069767
8130291,2,B000GB7GW8,"All of these shorts star Denise Duff, and feature actors from the Bloodstone/Vampire Journals films.

Unfortunately the connection is even closer. The last of these films ""Undead Evil"" is in fact a heavily edited version of ""Vampire Journals"" - they've shortened it to make it a 'new' feature.

Judging by this, I would guess that the first film ""Spawn of Hell"" is also one - I haven't seen all the ""Bloodstone"" films, though.

So, if you've seen the Bloodstone films, there's no point buying these 'new' films.",1169683200,7,511,4.850574712643678
