4208573,4,B003VADRVK,"Not sure if the other reviewers have a different version or what, but here is the episode list from the set I just bought.  Note:  this collection does NOT contain the ""Vietnam: No Place Like Home"" episode...

Romania
So Long Summer (Labor Day clip show)
Mexico
Venice
Azores
Chicago
Food Porn
Philippines
Disappearing Manhattan
Sri Lanka
Sardinia
Chile
Bonus Materials:  ""Alternate Universe"" (short animated sketches)

I'm a huge Bourdain fan, but this collection does have a few stinkers.  The non-destination shows (Food Porn and So Long Summer) are waste.  And some of the destination shows fail to deliver - The Azores is not interesting enuf for an hour long show; in the Philippines show Tony seems genuinely bored and uninspired while the viewer who is supposed to his ""guide"" adds almost nothing; and the Chicago show is pretty dull.

However, there are some true gems.  Standouts for me are Sri Lanka (check out how terribly uncomfortable AB looks the beginning - clearly feeling ill); Romania, which is like a wacky buddy movie, with the antics of Tony and Zamir making for a really damn funny show; and Venice which is like an inspired little art house film, with brilliant narration and cinematography.  Few TV series can go from laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy and gluttony (Romania) to genuine artistry (Venice).

The bonus materials are garbage.  Just a few animated bits.  In the age of DVR and HDTV, there's not much here to justify purchasing low-res DVDs other than just to have the complete collection anytime you want it.  All in all, still pretty brilliant and in another universe form 99% of the other excrement on TV.",1291420800,15,1642,4.945255474452555
4208574,4,B003VADRVK,"No Reservations Collection 5, Part 1, collects the first episodes from season 5 of Anthony Bourdain's excellent travel/eating show with the infamous Romania show from season 4 also included.  This show is a bit of train wreck with Mr. Bourdain's old Russian friend Zamir celebrating his birthday and getting totally smashed during one sequence.  This is counterbalanced with the superb Disappearing Manhattan where Mr. Bourdain goes to classic New York places and wonders how long these types of establishments will survive in the ever increasing chain restaurant mentality the city seems to be adopted.  You also get a glimpse into Mr. Bourdain's family life on a trip to his wife's homeland of Sardinia as well as return trips to Mexico and Vietnam (where Mr. Bourdain is house shopping), a great episode in Chicago and a funny look at the die hard foodies of the blogging world in Food Porn.",1289779200,4,894,4.9865771812080535

8406560,5,B003VADRVK,"Great new places or great new views of old favorites.

Romania - Got to love Eastern Europe.

So Long Summer - What ever.

Mexico - Not your TJ mystery meat.

Venice - See it soon before it falls into the water.

Azores - Makes me wish I had more time there to get past the MAC terminal.

Chicago - Windy city has more than just hot dogs.

Food Porn - Not what you think; still worth watching.

Philippines - Just like General McArthur said ""We shall return.""

Disappearing Manhattan - He helped capture what could be lost.

Sri Lanka - Island life with a twist of Asia.

Sardinia - A great place to live with a hard winter.  Loved my time there at the US Navy base.  This show made me break out the family photos.

Chile - Made me wish I had more time there when I visited with the crew of the USS Ronald Reagan.

8406564,4,B003VADRVK,"I generally have ambivalent feelings about Anthony Bordain. When I saw that season 5 of his show was available at my local library, I decided to give it a chance. I enjoyed it, but it definitely reinforced my belief that Bordain is a bit of a smug you-know-what; at times he waxes eloquent about food and cultural identity (such as in his episode featuring Sardinia), and at other times he spouts infamous lines such as ""well, our chances of being utt rogered here by Tim Curry are fairly low"" (i.e., upon approaching a remote castle in Romania). However, that seems to be the beauty of his shows - being able to easily move between high-brow and low-brow aesthetics. This concept also applies to his gastronomic situations as well; in one scene he'll be eating a loaded hotdog on the streets of Chicago or Chile, and in the next, he'll be consuming toro in a fine dining scenario. I can understand, however, how some people may have a little bit of difficulty with some of the scenes in his shows. Specifically, he seems to have a penchant for showing the viewer the gory preparations for roasting whole pigs. While I wasn't personally offended by this, I did find it a bit eye-opening. Moreover, he also seems to relish the opportunity to eat foods that would turn many American's stomachs (bile soup anyone?) Finally, as an end note, I would have to say that Bordain wears the crown when it comes to the copious amount of booze that is consumed in every episode - No other cooking or travel show can boast such bacchanal levels of consumption.

My top 5 episodes (in no particular order) are: 1) Romania. 2) Venice. 3) Disappearing Manhattan. 4) Sardinia. 5) Chile.

Despite my minor criticisms, I very much enjoyed this series; I look forward to watching more.",1326240000,3,1764,4.668810289389068
8406565,4,B003VADRVK,"Enjoy his programs and have most of his collections now, but they try too hard to stretch things by dividing collections into two parts and repeating segments as parts of ""specials"". Not uncommon these days to get every last buck. Video quality has improved from early shows, but why no Blu-ray. Enjoy the program mainly to see other parts of the world and areas that few pay much attention to. He doesn't uncover much original in the food anymore, but the travel is outstanding. Probably when the series is over, they will then issue a blu-ray to extract the last few dollars possible. He must feed most of the grub to his crew to stay thin and who believes everything tastes so good. The shows where he has a companion are also better. Also they need to edit out all the transitions in and out of breaks. We don't need to see the parental warnings five or six times per program.",1323129600,,880,4.472049689440993
