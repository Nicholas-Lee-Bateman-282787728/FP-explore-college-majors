7424961,5,B014VVNY7E,"I love this woman's music & spirit.  I had seen this documentary at the movies &really appreciated the way it was made from early teen years throughout.  Shows who she really was at heart & definitely not the junkie the media made her out to be.  She got lost.  I used to be & was lucky enough to make it back.  She, unfortunately, trusted the wrong people.  Amy was a fabulously soulful woman & her voice takes you to heaven & back--I love watching her perform.  Love this documentary & I do want to say,  it reminds you of the wonderful caring friends  she did have in her life--the beauty of love has that dark side & she had love too deep for the wrong man.  If you like Amy,  get this documentary.  Worth adding to the life collection.",1507766400,,740,4.244604316546763

7425002,3,B014VVNY7E,"I don't comprehend reviewers calling this the best documentary they've ever seen. Was this their first? Amy herself of course is magnetic, and this documentary gives a taste of the enormous talent in her that we have lost. As a movie however, it stinks, comprised only of snippets of interviews with those who knew her, some homemade film of her being interesting and lovely, and a very parsimonious sampling of her performances. When you seek out a film like this you are entitled to expect some real narration of a life story, some analysis of what made her great, and some realistic explanation of her downfall and death - none of which occurs in any depth in this whitewashed review.",1472947200,,687,4.733333333333333

7425018,4,B014VVNY7E,"One of the finest music-related docs in years, ""Amy"" goes way beyond the usual hagiography. Thanks to unusually frank interview segments with her husband, docs and drug counselors, friends and family, and even the normally reticent head of the label, the film digs deep to arrive at places other pop bios can only hope for. Superb film will leave even longtime fans -- of which I'm not one although I can appreciate much of her second album -- with a new view of the troubled late North London songbird.

7425021,5,B014VVNY7E,"The best documentary I've ever seen about a musical icon!  Most documentaries are written by other people-- and although this was produced by a team, there is so much footage of Amy from her childhood to her adulthood, that it could almost be mistaken that she made this documentary herself!  My sister and I both saw this when it was in the Indie theatre in our town, and we both left in tears and stunned by the greatness of this documentary.  I know Mitch Winehouse is not happy about how he was portrayed, but sometimes the truth hurts... It doesn't mean they didn't love each other, or that their relationship wasn't good. It's been said by several people that Mitch was living vicariously through Amy, because her singing career eclipsed his own.  Not that he wasn't happy for her-- but it was stated by many people that he was a bit of an opportunist.  I read Mitch's book about Amy, as well, and I found it to be a little bit self-indulgent on his part.  I don't doubt that he made great strides to help Amy, but I think the documentary showed a more accurate account of her life. It was awesome to see so many of her friends and family and workers come together to talk about their love for her, their collaborations, her music, her talent... etc... And the point where she wins the Grammy was so incredible to be able to see her live reaction... My heart will never stop missing Amy, and this documentary gives me a little piece of her forever. I'm glad that this documentary showed the good, the bad, and the ugly.  This is a Must-Buy for any true Amy Winehouse Fan.",1462924800,7,1577,4.43598615916955
7425022,5,B014VVNY7E,There is nothing any one can say that will change my mind about my girl Amy. She was a lost soul before she even got started and I truly believe that if she had the right people around her and she would still be alive today. Makes me cry knowing that no one really cared about her just the money she was making. Or the possibility to make. Either way she was one of the best singers of our time and thinking about the music we are missing because of this loss....well RIP my sweet Amy. I am sure that you are better now.,1462838400,,520,4.009615384615385

I hadn't heard of this movie much, and discovered it on Amazon prime on my smart tv. Bored one afternoon, I decided to watch.. And I'm so glad I did. It's beautiful, moving, heartbreaking.. I couldn't stop thinking about this girl with amazing talents, consumed by dysfunction and devoured by celebrity. It is fitting that she finally is viewed as a real person with feelings and fears and hopes, not just some drunken, drugged public figure to ridicule, stalk and criticize, all the while indulging in her life very publicly imploding. This film left me amazed at her phenomenal talent, shocked at her swift downfall and just wishing she had made it to live the life of happiness she deserved.

What I will tell you is, which has nothing to do with the movies content, is that my Blu-Ray player model BDP-S360 is no longer working since I put this movie in there to be just played. It took a while to load and then only played the trailers before it totally went into electronic device hell, or heaven. In either case it's not alive anymore.

  I am a Jazz & Blues fan and own all of her CD's made........Her music is real and from her heart and it's all written by Amy.
  ..I was not sure what to expect when I heard her life was being portrayed for a Oscar as a documentary...........but really wanted to see this film,
I thought it might be a Beloushi or some of the other films that portray films as being great..........
  What a incredible job, if you want to truly see how our Country and our people are being destroyed by drugs this is a must see.
You will watch a young innocent woman get spun into the terrible world of drugs....
.If you know anyone using drugs or that has family or friends with a drug problem this tells the real story. Truly sad but also a Great representation of another incredible artist and human that we did not deserve to lose.

7425057,5,B014VVNY7E,"Amy Weinhouse left a mass of audio and visual reminders   tape recordings, videos, phone messages   in addition to her CD recordings. Amy is a skillful mix of these recordings in a documentary blended with interviews from those who were closest to her in life. The result is an excellent documentary which rightfully won the 2016 Academy Award for Best Documentary. It is also a painful viewing experience of the day-by-day meltdown of a tremendous talent.

What could have gone wrong? Tony Bennett praised her as the greatest living jazz singer. No mean compliment coming from a great jazz singer in his own right. From the fully documented video and audio record in this documentary, themes in her life emerge.

A troubled childhood. Yes, most of us have had a troubled childhood, but a number of factors in her life were also present that fueled a life of substance abuse. Amy absolutely adored her father, who left Amys mother and was essentially not a factor in her upbringing. He re-entered her life later to act as her quasi-manager, but in the times when she needed a strong father figure the most, what he had to offer was not enough. He could have done more to shield her away from the crowd circling around her when she started having trouble with the law and with drugs. His idea of intervention was simply to indicate to the press that Amy would cancel touring temporarily. This fell short to the mental and physical exhaustion she felt. Amy needed an extended period to get her head straight and simply cancelling a tour was not enough; she still recorded in the studio and made brief appearances. Thus, her father appeared more interested in keeping the cash cow alive instead of providing a period of rest.

Her entourage.  Amy never stopped socializing with her friends, a group of people, most of whom whose idea of having a good time appeared to be getting as drunk as possible with alcohol or as stoned as possible on drugs.

Finally a point made a couple of times in the documentary is that she needed someone to say no. In other words, no one placed any effective limits on her behavior.

Amy Weinhouse was a tremendous talent and should have had a long recording career. Someone should have shook her shoulders and told her to wake up. Keith Richards, through the press, tried doing this with a public warning that if she did not change her drug-taking habits she would not be around for long. Richards, of all people, knew what he was talking about.

I will give to my daughter to share with her teenage daughter in due time just as a real story about what can start in teenage years if looking for answers that are so misleading, and will have a terrible ending with these choices.

7425068,5,B014VVNY7E,"Amazingly you get her whole life on film from a very young girl of about 7 to her final moments at 27.  Interestingly as a young girl she had her own way of a singing style and that was her lure as an adult artist and that her unique-ness.  Sure partying caught up with her the age of 27 is when your not really super young and not by any means a full grown adult but an adult and it caught up with her and defeated her like so many other 27 year olds that came before her.  Amy Winehouse had talent and would've made a great artist.  In her short time she proved to be great definitely with her 1st album/cd.  The highlight in the film but not such a great moment was Amy with Tony Bennett because it tied her in with other girls from this generation who looked to Tony Bennett and cherished singing with him...it was a very symbolic moment but yet sad.  I was pulling for Amy to come through and Tony Bennett was nice about it and positive to her...and you can say likewise for her fate...there I was pulling for her but deep down I knew the outcome as this is a biography of a real person that somehow most of it was captured on film.  I recommend this film to both fans of Amy Winehouse and fans of just popular culture as we all probably heard her songs and saw her perform even if it was on TV or via Video...definitely worth your time and $$$ plus it's a great film about being an artist and the demands of performing...it will definitely give you an idea and perspective of what it's like...which thinking about it may have been part of her downfall too the demands of public life and performing...as she asked several times what it would be like to not be noticed and I really believed her...she was a soft and loving soul not by any means hard or narccistic...perhaps a tad spoiled but it's kind of part of the culture and she did straighten herself out and became productive for awhile but then those party girl ways destroyed her...I can't explain destruction or why it happens...we all do things we shouldn't do but we do them to understand it probably won't ever be fully understood but it happens and this film documents all that...it's educational too...perhaps for a young child to see, the destruction of alcohol and related stuff of alcohol...yes it was troubling to watch but that's what makes a great documentary...it shows ALL the good, the bad, the beaufiul and the ugly...I recommend this and put it at the top or near the top of all ""documentaries related to popular culture and more specifically musical icons.",1456012800,,2536,4.405982905982906

7425078,4,B014VVNY7E,"I often find reviewing documentary films the hardest.  It is difficult to keep opinions about the subject matter distinct from the quality of the filmmaking.  Amy Winehouse was a rising jazz singer with her foot into blues, rock and pop as well.  She, like many talented musicians before her (Morrison, Joplin, Hendrix, and Cobain), never made it to their 28th birthday.  And like them, drugs and booze were the eventual contributors.  In Amys case, bulimia compounded matters.

Director Asif Kapadia for the most part dispenses with a long series of talking heads speaking to her talent and problems, although not entirely.  Mostly, Kapadia has assembled an array of home movies, amateur films, TV appearance, news footage and film shot by a crew hired by her contemptuous father, Mitchell to tell her story from about 14 to her death at 27.  While somewhat rebellious in her teens thanks to a fractured home life, she didn't get heavily into drugs and alcohol until she met and fell in love with scum-bag (there I go judging), Blake Fielder-Civil.  A few years older, he drew Amy into his life of partying, drinking and drugs.  She seemed committed to stay with him drink for drink, drug for drug.  He was clearly using her celebrity to his advantage, especially after a stint in the slammer.

They eventually parted ways, but Amy never got over him and deteriorated further even after getting sober for stretches.  In one telling scene, she is watching the Grammy Awards while still in England.  When she wins record of the year, she and her crew are rapturous.  Backstage she confides to her childhood friend that it isn't the same unless you're high.  Sad.  Still credit to Kapadia and his editors for putting a fine film together.",1454716800,,1736,4.850340136054422

7425084,3,B014VVNY7E,"A whineumentary about yet another overindulged, out of control entertainer suffering from ""Poor little rich girl"" syndrome. Even if you had never heard of her before watching this voyeuristic exploitation you would know things were not going to end well when she remarked early on that ""she had wanted to move out of her muvvers flat since she was firteen so she could lay around all day smoking weed"". Some aspiration she had there, and what a fine role model she would turn out to be.

I must say that her father was quite a piece of work. Absent for most of her life he certainly came around, entourage in tow, when the cash started to flow. I wonder if he is still wringing a living out of her years after her untimely yet thoroughly predictable demise.

I gave it three stars because nobody had yet done so, even though it really only deserved two. If you have nothing better to do with two hours of your life than watch someone spiral down the crapper, give it a watch. Or maybe let it play in the background while you do something constructive.",1453680000,,1051,4.46875
7425085,5,B014VVNY7E,"Amy Winehouse was born in London in 1983.  She attended school for the performing arts and, from about the age of fourteen, made several quasi-professional appearances before a friend sent a demo tape to A&R.  This led to a series of auditions, and Winehouse was signed by 19 Management.  She spent some time under wraps and ultimately signed a deal with EMI.  The result was the album FRANK.  The recording was a smash in England, but Winehouse was not satisfied, for she did not have complete creative control over the recording.  She made sure this would not be a future issue, and in 2006 released BLACK TO BLACK.  It was immensely successful and it launched Winehouse into the white hot fame that would prove so corrosive.  She made personal appearances and recorded more material, but she would not live to create another album.  She died at age 27 in London in 2011.

AMY, directed by Asif Kapadia and released in 2015, documents Winehouses life from about the time she began to perform professionally until her death, but it does so in a somewhat unexpected way.  There are no talking heads, no opinions from biographers and musicologists.  The film is drawn from casual video footage taken by friends and family, from television and concert productions, and similar sources.  Very often there is contemporary commentary from friends and family, other artists and business associates, but by and large the emphasis is on Amy being Amy.  The result is both magical and devastating.

The journey between those points is dramatically captured in the commentary that underscores the film footage.  AMY does not make judgments about its subject or the people in her life, but I think it is fairly safe to say that her father, Mitchell Winehouse, and her eventual husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, come off very, very poorly, and they are indicative of the self-serving people that coalesced around Winehouse as she became a superstar vocalist, shutting out people who genuinely had Winehouses best interests at heart.  But there is no escaping the fact that Winehouse was an addictive personality, and like all addicts, she did not realize she was one until she became one.  There were interventions, efforts at rehab, a media feeding frenzy, concert disasters, and a commonplace, sordid end.

Winehouse is often compared to Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix, all of whom died at age 27, but I think she is probably best compared with Judy Garland.  They share many traits.  But AMY is not interested in comparisons; it is interested in Winehouse as an individual, who she was, what she became, and what she might have been if she had survived the ferocity of fame, a very bad love affair, and her own addictions.  It is an astonishing and powerful film.  The DVD includes several brief bonuses and an audio commentary that is worth hearing.  Strongly recommended.

7425086,5,B014VVNY7E,"This is what we got, this DVD -- relatively thin considering her importance -- because she passed at such a young age. The filmmaker probably should have filled us in more on her ""learning curve"" - because her blazing, but disciplined gift didn't just fall down from the sky.

Tony Bennett said, ""She was one of the truest jazz singers I've ever heard. She had the complete gift"".

For me, this DVD was also a 'biography of Fans'. And I think her sound was becoming more of a Hybrid - a synthesis of the best of our musical styles, though obviously primarily Jazz.

At a concert in Serbia, she refused to sing and just looked amused and defiant. ""It felt like the end. It was someone who really didn't care anymore."" - said bandmate Sam Beste. But to me she seemed to be rebelling against us Fans, and others who couldn't see her as a person and not a commodity to bought sold and marketed.

""The most famous artists I've ever met are the most nervous before they hit that stage."" ""No matter how much you feel it, you want to feel it even more, so that it becomes an Honest recording. And that's what Amy had.  She had that Gift.""  ""She was a natural, true Jazz singer, and a Jazz artist doesn't like 50,000 people in front of them."" -- Tony Bennett.

 ""She was such a Jazz snob,"" ""I thought I had my doctorate in Jazz, but Amy taught me a lot."" -- Questlove.
Her emotional range is what amazed me. Maybe it is too much for one person. A couple of her songs were just staggering!  She was an original - and there is no finer song stylist, ever. But it seemed to me she needed much support and constant love to balance the music biz.

Even after Amy had her peak experience - a Grammy presented transatlantically via TV by one of her Idols, Tony Bennett -- she told her childhood friend, ""This so boring without drugs.""  To me that is a statement of a person so extremely over-blessed with gifts that she is trying to appease folks around her who are Not so blessed.

Her ex-manager Nick Shymansky: ""She couldn't escape her life in this horrible goldfish bowl.""  The feeding frenzy, Paparazzi, the jealousy, the late-night ridicule -- ""she couldn't escape it.""  Amy had said: ""I'm not a girl trying to be a star -- or anything other than a Musician.""

Mos Def said one day Amy took out her foil and used her drugs (after several rehabs and hospitalizations). ""This is someone who was trying to disappear,"" he said.
""If I could give it [her talent] back -- just to walk down that street with no hassle, I would."" Amy said the night before her death, as reported by bodyguard Andrew Morris.
RIP Ms. Amy; Your music lives.",1453507200,3,2618,4.391304347826087

Not an uncommon tale of those with so much talent but unable to stay on the surfboard of fame. This documentary is powerful in getting that across and in Amy Winehouse's case this was so. Ms Winehouse is mostly a likeable, somewhat tempestuous woman but the men in her life, well her dad and husband come across as weasels of the lowest kind. She was never able to free herself from them or the demons they had set in her mind as she matured or immatured into adulthood. It was sad because there was a sense that a grounded mature Amy Winehouse would have been a soul/jazz diva second to none. And this documentary reminded me of why I do not listen to the likes of Tony Bennet. I much prefer Aretha Franklin, who would have been a better template/mentor for Ms Winehouse.

This documentary is brilliantly told and well made. They keep in mind that there are Amy Winehouse fans watching, but there's also an audience that doesn't know her at all. They try their best to tell her tale as truthful as it can be told. It's not like every documentary where they tell you how great he/she was and how much of a loss to music he/she was. They don't feed you garbage, they're telling the truth about her life and her experiences. She made mistakes and she did fall, but it also keeps in mind that anyone could have fallen like her. To me, that's an impressive achievement for a documentary.

This documentary is amazing thanks to it's cold hard facts. When it suddenly ends, you leave the theater thinking that the music industry lost someone so gifted. It doesn't beat that message into your head like other documentaries. It showcases her talent amazingly and still reminds us that Amy is still a human being through all her obstacles.

The wrenching pain you feel when you're heart is broken, rejected,. She explains how she wants to express her anecdotal feelings the way his shirt smelled or the reminders in everyday sightings of a toothbrush, etc..She complements JAZZ,. She is happy in her own skin. When Amy, was dabbling with contemporary music she wrote ""Rehab"" , within an hour it was a playful melody that she never thought twice about. Amy, was involved with Jazz, in a more elitist level. The song rehab was pivotal . The fame was what started the downward spiral . I felt Amy, was along a lot. The people around her where out for their own gains. Amy, is an icon a star in her own right. I am so sorry I did not get to see her live in NYC. At Jazz clubs or on the circuit . I would have traveled to London. just to see her. What I did not understand is if her mum visited her the day before her death and found her to be reeking of alcohol, why did she not call for an ambulance?. God bless Amy Winehouse, and may she rest in peace. I will never forget her .",1451088000,,1625,4.030959752321982

7425134,5,B014VVNY7E,"Have been an Amy Winehouse fan since I first heard her in 2006. Was extremely hurt when Amy passed away in 2011 at the very young age of 27. I have collected her official CD & vinyl  releases and her unofficial vinyl releases (believe me there are more unofficial high quality releases on vinyl than official releases. sad that her dad & record company sit on these treasures). I also collect Amy on DVD. When I saw this film was being released I really was happy that Amy's legacy was being carried on. I had read Amy's father's book on her and was kinda apprehensive when he started making a fuss about how he was portrayed in the documentary. I mean film can't lie? After watching this DVD twice, there were three people who really didn't have Amy's best interest at heart. #1. Blake Fielder, the ex husband who Amy married in 2007 & divorced in 2009. He was the one who introduced Amy to hard core drugs and Amy nearly died trying to keep up with him. #2. Raye her manager, this man when realizing his client was a heroin addict, said to one of Amy's concerned friends  ""there are doctors, lawyers and other higher up people who can function on this stuff"", Really? Idiot. #3. Amy's father, Mitch. Amy was in St Lucia to get clean and get away from the constant press hassle. Her Dad arrives with a camera crew to film her there! According to her bodyguard,  Amy even offered him the cash that he was being offered for the filming! At one point prior to this, it was brought to Mitch's attention that Amy desperately needed rehab, as to which Mitch replied, ""But she has to go on tour""! The poor girl had no chance with all the vultures surrounding her. The film is a mostly a beautiful tribute to a talent that comes along once in a lifetime. It's like actually being ""there"". The one part that I found fault was that they didn't show too much about her actually breaking her drug habit in 2008. Sadly her alcohol intake increased. If you're an Amy fan, you will mostly love this for the rare footage. There are clips of rare unreleased songs that should have a proper release. If you're an emotional person, as I am, you will need a tissue. This movie sure touched my heart. It made me fall in love with Amy all over again. And, it opened up the still fresh wound of losing her all over again....",1449187200,30,2302,4.373831775700935
7425135,5,B014VVNY7E,"Amy is a heart breaking but informative documentary about the tragic story of Amy Winehouse. Directed by Asif Kapadia, the documentary outlines the early years of Amy's life before she became a music icon with interesting anecdotes from family members and close friends. It begins with her teen years and family struggles then moves into the desire to write songs that meant something to her and then her desire to gain a record deal followed by the trappings of fame and substance abuse. The documentary includes lots of home videos provided by family and friends along with footage of excellent performances and absolutely horrendous drunken performances. The highlight of the documentary was watching Amy lay down some amazing vocal tracks in the studio which ended up on her albums and also the bonus footage showing her performance of a few songs with just an acoustic guitar which was simply amazing. Whilst this documentary doesn't provide any new information regarding the circumstances of her career and death, Amy is definitely a great summation of a truly gifted singer and songwriter who struggled with everything except the music.",1448323200,,1143,5.150537634408602

7425139,4,B014VVNY7E,"I saw this doc twice in the theatre but ONLY after reading her dad Mitch's book ""Amy, My Daughter"" first.  I needed to get the full picture before I saw the movie, based on the complaints I heard from him in the media about the movie, and how disappointed he was.  So I then watched it with an open mind, keeping track of what I read and matching it to the images on the screen.  And they got it 70% right, they left out 30% of other stuff, which could have shown her getting better, how she kicked hard drugs, her close relations to her family, espesh her dad & her protege, Dionne, how she was recovering on the islands, how Blake was a cancer and wouldn't leave her alone, how badly the press ran her through the ringer, how Blake's mom was leaking false stories about her to the media for money.  How she was recording the Bond theme for ""Quantum Of Solace"" but it got scrapped because of these problems and schedules kept getting messed up.

This movie just showed her on a downward spiral, but was not a clear picture, the way it was edited.  I DID like what was included, and how it's just her words and her talking, singing, etc.  You got the feel of her personality.  I got to meet her once and see her live once, at NYC's Bowery Ballroom, and it was unforgettably awesome, met her after her soundcheck, trying to buy a ticket for the show that night, 5 minutes after arriving, there she was, charming as ever, tall, that beehive, sticks out her hand, and in her charming accent ""Hellloi, Oim Imy!!"", and gives me a wink...wow...almost bgot my CD signed but she had to get to an interview, so OK, no problem, I'd get stuff signed after the show (see below)...I have unpublished pics from the show that I took that I want to get printed up, they were killer and I was right upfront, like sitting on a goldmine, not unlike having unpublished John Lennon shots...I want to get em to her family... Anyhoo, after the show, something happened that made me REALLY angry, and this is typical from everything depicted in the media.  Me & a bunch of fans were waiting outside the Bowery Ballroom after the show...then this idiot photographer runs in the venue and freaks her out!!  She runs out the venue, gets in a car & drives off!!  I was ready to bash that guy's head in for ruining that opportunity!!  And I figured I'd wait till the next NYC show that she's return and I'd get stuff signed and see her again.

Never had that opportunity again because she was never able to do another US tour and she is no longer with us.  I feel fortunate that I got to experience Amy live at all, and that this movie was made, flaws and all...now about those pics, what do I do??  Also, read Mitch's book first before watching.  The soundtrack is great too.",1446422400,11,2747,4.346379647749511
7425140,5,B014VVNY7E,"*** I wanted to make a few quick additions to my initial review of the film, which is below. I purchased the film on Blu-Ray; always knew I wanted to watch it again & I just got around to picking-up a copy. Aside from being able to view the film in its entirety a second time, I wasn't aware the disc would come with as many extras or special features as it did. We get an audio commentary for the entire length of the feature, a handful of deleted scenes taken out for running time, additional unseen Amy performances & lengthy interviews from various sources, & a slew of trailers used to campaign the film.
The extras themselves, are actually quite great -- especially the deleted scenes and extended interviews. Having said that, I did want to let people in on a few thoughts I had while I watched the picture for a second time. I saw the film almost immediately upon release in theaters - suffice to say that everybody, including myself, has been exposed (since the films release), to an array of articles, reviews, and general publicity surrounding the film.
I knew when I saw it for the first time that Janis Winehouse (Amy's Mother) hadn't really vehemently spoken-out against it -- only to mention something to the effect of the fact that she didn't believe she could ever force herself to watch it because it would be too difficult. Amy's father, Mitch Winehouse, is another story. While initially participating in the early phases of the project, he has now used the press to condemn the film as unsupported by the Winehouse family at large & that the film contains blatant untruths.

So here's the deal -- in reading the review I initially posted and watching the film twice, I wanted to make it clear as to what circumstances were at play for me and why I still love and appreciate the film just as much, if not more so than my original experience. I think Mitch Winehouse should attempt to give Amy's fans and the general public a little more credit intellectually than he appears to do. He lost his daughter. I can't really imagine what that might be like. And I, as a viewer, would never take the time to address or believe in the idea that he didn't love his daughter. That's just nuts. A couple of the scenes in the film that feature Mitch, which are few & far between, seem to somewhat leave a negative impression -- and it's sort of easy to understand why. In the early years of Amy's childhood, he slightly gives a flippant disregard to the idea that Amy didn't simply 'get over' his affair & departure from the household. He's shown as non-supportive toward what would have been Amy's first (perhaps last) trip to rehab -- even before ""Back to Black"" was written. More so concerned with contractual obligations as opposed to the glaring issues with Amy's health. Interested in bringing a camera crew around her at a very difficult and poignant time in her recovery.
There are a few more documented in the film -- but you get the picture.
But the reason I truly feel as though he should give the public a bit more credit is because I think it's important as a viewer to remember the impact these admissions have when they are strung-together like this. Of course it's shocking and concerning. Despite the way Mitch was portrayed, even if the portrayal was never distorted, it's important to remember and understand that Amy adored her father. I wouldn't for one second build an opinion on him as a father or his moral character based on those moments alone. That's just irresponsible and wrong. With regard to the film, I look at his actions as a father and friend to be imperfect. He's admitted as such; there are things and occurrences he would consider regrettable on his part.

So when you watch the film -- I would recommend that you do it responsibly, just as I have. There are many aspects that are heartbreaking and yet it doesn't exist to railroad any one particular person or group, which the filmmakers have stated on numerous occasions. It doesn't aim to blame -- questions are raised but the answers aren't really there or even that important. It's tragic. And with tragedy, comes the need to explain every aspect. Some things are unexplained.

At the end of the day, I would hope people understand that this film triumphs. It's beauty is in being able to meet the real girl; the real Amy. She was hilarious. I would also really hope that this project gives even slight pause to those who have condemned her passing as expected or unsurprising. As if her death, purely due to her addictions or not, made her unworthy of respect. All in all, I hope this film can give her the respect she deserves -- as a woman & an artist.

First off, let me mention just how much I was looking forward to seeing this film. Most of these types of films, usually due to the lack of a real comprehensive budget or practically the lack of much of a budget at all, have a difficult time being distributed as widely as a large, big-budget studio film. I live just outside Seattle and I thought for sure that it wouldn't be released or available any closer anytime soon. Well I was wrong. I was able to see the film in my city - 20 to 30 minutes outside Seattle. With a documentary, even of this caliber, it's extremely rare -- and I can't overemphasize the importance of this. ""Amy,"" the film itself, is just as rare & special. A major reason I loved it, which no doubt explains why it was so successful in theatres and encouraged with mainstream publicity, is because of it's ability to present inherent authenticity. Documentaries with similar subjects regarding well-known people can be somewhat sidelined and diluted, due to a majority of these films having to rely so heavily on the observations, conjecture, or speculation of others; often leaving the viewer wondering which version of the truth to swallow. This is not that film in any regard. Living in an era of great technological advancement allows us, the public, to rapidly capture and consume information via many outlets and formats -- for better or worse. As a result of this, there is a plethora of footage, both professional and amateur, to look back on, or in the case of this film, use to it's advantage.
Bottom line: ""Amy"" is a real, fractured and beautiful representation of Amy as an individual -- as told by Amy herself. This film operates with a sense of integrity - just how much integrity will be up to you as the viewer. Asif Kapadia (the director), imbues the audience by successfully & responsibly representing Amy Winehouse -- both the musician and the person or human behind her genius. It's raw, it's heartbreaking -- by no means did Kapadia intend to sugarcoat a subject or provide only one aspect of a situation. We, the audience, get to legitimately experience the good and the bad of her short & inspiring life -  a brutally honest and gorgeous life at that -- both uncompromising and unbiased. Whether you had considered yourself a fan of hers or not, by the time the film has reached it's end, you truly feel as though you've lost a friend you never realized you had. ""Amy"" has the power to resonate - it's an extremely fitting & appropriate piece of work that allows us to say goodbye to an extremely talented, beautiful soul. Despite whatever issues or problems she dealt with personally, I know that her presence will be greatly missed - a life that may have been short, but created an impressive & enduring legacy with which to be thankful for. We will forever have her music - and for that, I think we're lucky.

Another great aspect of the documentary is that it isn't superficial in any way. Yes, this is a film about Amy and the life she was living or forced to live as a result of her success; success ultimately resulting in a complete decline or descent into herself  -- Protecting herself, if you will.

I highly recommend seeing this film - one of, if not the best documentaries on any subject I've ever had the pleasure to see. It definitely has a lot of layers to it that are important and might not be discovered from the first viewing. One of the real, haunting layers is how Amy's descent was perpetrated by the general public or populace having been entirely engrossed and hungry for this rather obscene ""celebrity obsessed"" culture. The idea itself isn't new - but this film sort of reflects its' message(s), if you will, back towards the audience as if to declare or associate mirrored culpability. Unfortunately, our celebrity obsessed culture doesn't feel like it's on the way out -- despite several casualties along the way.",1445212800,60,8549,4.60498687664042
