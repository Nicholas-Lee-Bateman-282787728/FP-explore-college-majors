3772840,1,B001R3YRJ4,I'm fairly easy to please when it comes to movies. But this movie was just odd. The plot was understandable but how many men would choose to neglect their wife & child to stay in their boyhood home a few more days to reminisce? My wife and I made it 30 minutes into this movie and then had to move on. I recommend you do the same.,1388707200,,330,3.9402985074626864
3772841,5,B001R3YRJ4,"Like Andrew Wagner's The Talent Given Us and Lena Dunham's Tiny Furniture, real-life parents of filmmakers play themselves as family dynamics play out with humor, discomfort, agony, joy, and a moving emotional reality we can all embrace (or not).",1295222400,,246,5.333333333333333
3772842,5,B001R3YRJ4,"A whimsical, but painfully true film about a young man whose parents have unintentionally  made life so comfortable for him that it impedes his ability to leave home and be a functioning adult. Mikey comes home to NY from California (where he has a wife and  baby) on a business trip and stays in his parents' wonderfully eccentric and bohemian loft. He sleeps in his old bed and pulls out his childhood toys and comic books. He invents excuse after excuse not to leave creating a web of lies and eventually becomes so agoraphobic that he can't leave the loft. His mom, a first-class enabler (the name of the film is so true) constantly asks ""Is everything OK?"" while simultaneously offering him coffee, tea, oatmeal, soup and home-cooked meals as she psychologically undermines him. His shrewd dad is caught in the middle; he doesn't wan't to upset his wife, but in going along with her and Mikey, he marginalizes himself. Mikey has a childhood friend who also seems to be overstaying his welcome at his mom's place, which suggests that this is a generational problem that's not Mikey's alone.

According to the notes, this film was shot in director Azazel Jacob's parent's loft with his actual parents playing the roles of Mikey's parents. One of the pleasures of the film is their fabulously old-time loft-pioneer living space. It's hard for the Mikeys of this world to create their own identity in the shadow of such gifted parents. Momma's Man is a slow-paced film with beautifully shot scenes of New York City (maybe this what Mikey really misses).",1292544000,10,1554,4.812734082397004
3772843,5,B001R3YRJ4,"I'm so glad I occasioned this movie on Reel 13. I really felt it captured the conflict and reality of becoming an adult for the 30-40's generation (my generation). I loved the regression of the main character, it was slow, methodical and accurate. It seemed to be my self, my time, my toys, my conflict - yes I was totally drawn into this well crafted story (and I'm a woman!). Thanks Azazel Jacobs.",1274227200,2,399,4.47945205479452
8337224,5,B001R3YRJ4,"Mamma's Man is an exquisite New York film that may not be easily appreciated by people exposed only to Hollywood type films that easily hypnotize with constant action. The word that comes most strongly to me is Respect. Consideration and respect. And an old classic film that it called to mind was Ozu's Floating Weeds where the Japanese director gave his audience the same respect and consideration as Azazel Jacobs gives us here. And Azazel Jacobs miraculously shows us where he learned that respect and consideration - his parents, who play themselves! They are avant-garde artists, not professional actors!  What an astonishing achievement and tribute to his parents!  What pleasure they must feel with their son's ability to portray such fine-tuned sensibilities!

I was so thrilled to see this film and feel that respect and consideration that Azazel Jacobs gave me by providing the pauses and spaces allowing me time to reflect for myself the scenes he was presenting. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience, Azazel, one that is too rare in TV and Hollywood films. And for sharing your remarkable parents with us all. You are a rare treasure. May you live long and prosper!",1505692800,,1186,4.97979797979798

Mikey: Nothing ma...
Mother: Something's wrong, isn't it?
Mikey: No it's just that...
Mother: What Mikey, What?
Mikey: No it's...
Mother: Can I get you some coffee, tea, oatmeal, or soup, Mikey?
Mikey:  No ma I think... I'm not hungry...
Mother: It's our messy apartment, isn't Mikey? I knew it.
Mikey: No ma. The apartment is fine. I'm kinda messy myself so...
Mother: Is it because your father and I dropped too much acid while I was pregnant with you?
Mikey: No ma, everything's fine, it's just...
Mother: What Mikey, what? Come on sit down with me, come on Mikey.
Mikey: No ma, I have work and...
Mother: You must sit down with me and your father...
Mikey: Okay ma, just let me take my jacket off and put this ancient cell phone down cause...

Mikey: It's just that... well it's kinda like... what I mean is...
Mother: Tell us Mikey, tell us...
Mikey: It's the plot. It really sucks. And the dialogue, I keep having to say it's nothing over and over again...
Mother: Just go with it, we have almost two hours to fill in... we can't just keep showing dark clips of nothing happening...
Mikey: Well can I spend another five minutes singing off key?
Mother: No Mikey, it hurts your father's ears.
Mikey: Well I'm not going to watch my old buddy do exercise while singing Indigo Girls songs...
Mother: Maybe we can put in more flashing light stuff, how about that, Mikey?
Mikey: No, I'm afraid people will start having epileptic seizures and sue us...
Mother: Surf down a flight of stairs on your back then.
Mikey: Fine. If that's how you feel I'm going to go back to Laura and don't try giving me those old 3-D puzzles.
Mother: Here's a dollar, Mikey,  take it. Are you sure you don't want some coffee, tea, oatmeal, or soup?

8337230,2,B001R3YRJ4,It was an ok movie. I'm into movies off the beaten path but it was a bit sullen for me.,1398643200,3,87,3.4
8337231,2,B001R3YRJ4,I felt this movie was very boring and slow moving to hold ones attention. It holds viewer of trying to figure out what is going on in actors head instead of portraying it in the movie. I did give it a chance and watched half of the movie. I would not suggest this movie unless you need help to fall asleep.,1390176000,2,306,4.032786885245901
8337232,1,B001R3YRJ4,"This movie was a complete waste of the viewers time.  You keep hoping that something is going to happen, something, anything, and nothing ever does.  You hope that soon their gonna get to the good part...problem...there was no good part to get to.  Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT waste your time watching this movie.",1389398400,,310,4.6
8337233,5,B001R3YRJ4,"I'm so glad that Azazel Jacobs made this film and recorded for (hopefully eternity) his parent's fascinating loft.  Ken Jacobs's 2 film classes comprised my entire college education.  If I had taken no other classes besides his, it would not have mattered.  I gained a completely new way of looking at the world.  Suddenly, there was a lot not to like about previously accepted institutions like Capitalism and Ronald Reagan. In fact, I've completly adopted his scathing anti-capitalist stance and his hatred of the overclass sociopaths (Ken on the great recession: ""the big winners will walk away and keep looting and the rest of us will be further impoverished."")  For every kid from upstate who every dreamed of creating art in NY (never mind your seedy lou reed/lower east side trips), Ken and Flo are two people who really did it.  Watching them in their home environment, looking at and creating film (and seeing the same kitchen table (off the street) where I interviewed him in 1997 for a school paper) was a real treat.  As far as the storyline is concerned, I think the movie would have been more compelling if Azazel had played himself instead of using the character Mikey.  But it is still a wonderful film full of humor and poignant moments.",1389052800,3,1254,4.8
