Amazing Adventures, Exciting Escapades,Terrible Tales, Perilous Pursuits, Merry Mishaps, Final Frolics(why isn't it no 7),Unseen Been, Best Bits.  It would make a great edition if u have a Mr. Bean collection. Also, ""Rowan Atkinson Live"" is good if u like him. My favorite is the Library sketch too, which can be found at the end of Amazing Adventures",1038528000,,517,4.733333333333333
7914275,4,B00000K328,"The park bench skit and the Horror Movie are great!
My favorite skit I can't find though - when he goes to the library and destroys an ancient book.
Oh, well, this is the best of the tapes that I've seen.",1026518400,,204,4.0
7914276,5,B00000K328,"I got this video in a box set called 'The Big Box of Beans', and it is the second of six videos in that set. Rowan Atkinson is without a doubt a very odd character, especially as Mr. Bean, but he is hands down hilarious. Many British comedies are so different from North American comedy that they don't seem funny to the general American public, but I think Mr. Bean should without a doubt be seen at least once by everyone in America, because he is hands-down the funniest oddball I have ever seen. If you get any satisfaction whatsoever from laughing, get this video!",1006560000,,569,4.428571428571429
7914277,2,B00000K328,"This Mr Bean tape does contain some good ideas, and the sketches are maybe even well-written and well-structured... but in fact, they are not that funny! Basicly a waste of money.",975369600,,179,4.806451612903226
