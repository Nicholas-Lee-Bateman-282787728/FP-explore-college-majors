The point of the movie is to raise money for the cause. People should go to dariusgoeswest.org and support the cause.  Buying this movie for $6 may save you money, but it won't support the movement.  Either way, watch it and buy a copy for a friend.",1321228800,,392,4.388888888888889
3092060,5,B0012LDNIC,"Darius Goes West is the story of Darius Weems, a 15 year old boy handicapped by Duchette's Muscular Dystrophy, and the trip of a lifetime across the country from Athens, Georgia to Los Angeles California to convince MTV's Pimp My Ride to pimp his wheelchair.  The movie will literally make you laugh and cry, and will leave you feeling inspired to make the most of your life.  Highly recommended for anyone who has a heart.",1203292800,13,423,4.626666666666667

8246695,5,B0012LDNIC,"Loved it. Darius and his friends were very entertaining and enlightening at the same time.  They gave light to the many challenges that the disabled face in real life. Made me think of ways that I can make an impact in the disability world. Darius himself is one brave and determined person, as well as the deep friendship they all formed is amazing.",1416182400,,350,4.555555555555555
