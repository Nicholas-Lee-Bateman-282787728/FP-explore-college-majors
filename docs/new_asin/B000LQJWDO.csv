They teach a lot of moves, and they are all moves that look good. They show everything from different angles too. Their video line was exactly what I was looking for.",1192147200,,317,4.129032258064516
8449421,4,B000LQJWDO,"This is a little dated (she doesn't say a word and he always refers to the women as ""gals"") and corny (her perpetual, never-varying smile gets to you after awhile) BUT it does allow the social ballroom dancer to pick up new steps much cheaper than private lessons.  (And being able to just put in the DVD and review steps after trying them at a dance is great.)  The organization is good and the steps are presented well and in a logical sequence.  I'm planning on buying more of Foster & Judi Lampert's collection.",1172102400,4,515,4.457446808510638
