8695606,1,B00RNTYHH8,The title should have warned me of the content. This documentary  DVD is the equivalent of a bad porno movie. No actual historical documents or portraits are used just bad recreations and music that must have been left over from a low budget horror movie. In one scene when Lady Jane Grey mounts the scaffold you can see the actress playing Lady Jane is wearing flip flops or thongs like she was on her way to the beach. Dates are incorrect. Jane Grey was not executed in 1558 and Edward the sixth reigned for 6 years not 4 years as stated. Research must have been done referencing Wikipedia. Gave up after that. Picture quality also very poor. Stay away from this if you are looking for a decent documentary.,1428537600,,709,4.496124031007752
8695607,3,B00RNTYHH8,"2 1/2 STARS FOR A NON-COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCTION WITH DATED PRODUCTION VALUES AND SHALLOW SCHOLARSHIP, BUT FULL OF INTERESTING STORIES (in non chronological order)

This 2002 Documentary has had several releases over the years and was written by Daniel Diehl and Mark Donnelly (who wrote the book by the same name).  It has many terrific but brief stories related to the Tower of London but orders them in a way that can be a bit scattered.  The production values are somewhat par for thinner budgets of 2002 timeframe, but appear very dated now with electronic and guitar background music that is odd and occasionally jarring.  With just three episodes, it's not possible to have a comprehensive story and the ones that are covered are very brief and not necessarily that scholarly.  They even miss the date of execution for Lady Jane though it could have been a slip of the tongue that never got corrected (again, the budget doesn't look that expensive).  There are some obvious famous omissions.  It is well narrated by Dallas Cambell with completely dramatized scenes in the background.  This is documentary and not drama though.  We hear the narrator's voice throughout with the scenes in the background as he describes what is happening.

COVERAGE:  Three episodes nearly 1 hour each with main highlights in order of appearance -

 - 1. DEADLY CROWN - focuses more on sovereigns (with departures) ---- Starts with some mention of torture techniques / Bloody Mary and famous torturer Edmund Bonner / flips back to William the Conqueror and the building of the Tower / First escapee Bishop of Durham, Ranulf Flambard / Jane Grey and Mary (Lady Jane) / Crown Jewels and famous robbery attempt by COL Blood

  - 2. SPIES & TRAITORS - more on executions and a focus on spies ----- Walsingham and the first Counter Espionage agency (protecting Elizabeth / Mary Queen of Scotts, Babington plotters, and Christopher Marlowe / Joseph Jacobs WWII German spy and final execution at the tower / 1780 Henry Laurens only American prisoner at the Tower / WWI Sir Roger Casement & Easter Uprising

  -3. VENGEFUL TOWER - I guess we can call this famous cases ---- Theft of Henry VIII's gold and love triangle between Alice Tangerville, husband, and John Borde her jailer / 1381 Only castle breach during peasants revolt, Wat Tyler and Henry II / 1690 Judge Jeffries and James II, Duke of Monmoth / 1147 Matilda, Stephen of Blois and Geoffrey de Mandeville

OTHER THOUGHTS: Though the content is generally very interesting, you can see that the order is fairy scattered and doesn't always even fit under the general title heading.  The picture quality is somewhat soft as this show is now aging.  The production values are not bad for the time it was produced, but are not that polished either.  The music is definitely out of place at times and can even be a bit jarring.  Nevertheless, I do think this program has value for at least pointing people in a direction to study.  I enjoyed it and Walsingham, and Richard II stories were particular highlights for me.

NOTE ON CONTENT:  There is some depiction of disembowelment that is probably tame by todays cinema standards, but still quite bloody if not particularly real looking.  There is also a couple brief instances of blurred nudity (at a distance through a veil or completely blurred.  No real detail.  I leave it to individuals and families to decide appropriate age viewing.",1426896000,2,3421,4.858376511226252
