8439523,4,B004S6NBD0,This is good if you like psycho hot chicks. And it's about revenge and not about a scorned woman who got cheated on.,1432684800,,116,4.086956521739131
8439524,2,B004S6NBD0,"When a rock star bursts into flames at the end of his performance only to set fire to the entire place, all hell breaks loose.  (What would you expect with all that fire - a fire extinguisher?) In the ensuing panic, a young boy is trampled to death. A too long camera shot of that incident telegraphs all you need to know.  (When are directors going to learn that you're not supposed to give too much away when you are trying to develop a murder mystery? They always underestimate their audience which has most likely seen it all before in some variation or another.)  Improbably, no one else got seriously hurt, not even the scorched rocker, except for the fact that he never wants to do that act again.  His audience, however, will have none of it.  They want fire!  Never mind the music.  By the way, if you look close enough, you'll see that the same people in the same clothing occupy the front row in two different performances separated in time and locale. After all, this is a low budget flick. What do you think we have here - The Beatles?Meanwhile, a groupie works her way into the group and begins to dispatch one member of the group after another. Now why would she do that? If she kills everybody, then there's no more group for the groupie.  Remember the young boy lying squashed on the floor...Finally, all comes to its incendiary conclusion (NO SPOILERS HERE). But not before Eric Roberts, a once very promising young actor who now seems to prefer shlock roles, exits the scene in a most ludicrous confrontation with the groupie. You can almost hear him whispering to the director: ""Let me out of here.""  Indeed, that's when I yelled: ""Let me out of here!""",1421193600,,1672,4.528239202657807
8439525,3,B004S6NBD0,"Look, I'll be blunt: You've seen this movie before, many times. So many, in fact, you can actually predict what's gonna happen next. However, Hal SHINES! For those familiar with his old band Poets & Pornstars, there are a couple songs from that time plus a couple of new ones. This is why you must have it (plus his acting, as per usual, is superb!)",1333065600,3,349,4.384615384615385
8439526,2,B004S6NBD0,"Judge Tom Becker, DVD Verdict-- For its first few minutes, Groupie had me stoked with its abundance of B-movie promise.

Imagine my thrill at the idea that director Mark L. Lester, writers Michael Feifer and Randall Frakes, and star Eric Roberts might be dusting off the classic Italian giallo formula and offering up a sleazy murder mystery/thriller, rather than the usual direct-to-DVD soft horror that's the current standard.

Unfortunately, after a promising 10 minutes or so, the film settles in to what it really is: a fairly slow-moving soft slasher that telegraphs its hand, thus avoiding any sort of shock or suspense.

The Dark Knights is a band with a gimmick: at the end of every show, lead singer Travis (Hal Ozsan, Dawson's Creek) sets himself on fire.

One night, a drunken, flaming Travis stumbles into a curtain, causing the club to go up in smoke. Fortunately, the casualty list is light--one guy gets trampled to death--but it's enough to give the band a reputation of being cursed and pull them out of circulation for a year.

Their manager, Angus (Eric Roberts, Star 80), books them on a comeback tour, and soon the Knights are enjoying the rock star life again on a tour bus complete with drugs and groupies.

Unfortunately, all that glitters isn't Malawi Gold. Travis refuses to do the flaming stunt, and this angers the fans, who boo and throw bottles at the end of each non-incendiary performance.

Then, a new groupie appears on the scene, the fetching Riley (Taryn Manning, Kill Theory). Travis finds himself taken with her, much to the chagrin of his main groupie, Nikki (Betsy Rue, Miss March).

As Riley gets closer to Travis, the other band members, as well as Angus, begin to resent her. They feel she's a disruptive influence and has some kind of agenda that they just can't figure out.

Boy, are they ever right.

The disc is serviceable: Clean image, surround and stereo audio options, and a useless ""making of"" as an extra.
