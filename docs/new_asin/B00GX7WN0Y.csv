6123436,4,B00GX7WN0Y,"I would definitely recommend this Christian movie. The acting is not necessarily the best, but it deals with some very important subjects such as an unfaithful husband, struggling single mom and the destruction pornography causes a family. It arrived promptly and in good shape.",1477958400,2,278,5.340909090909091

8628323,5,B00GX7WN0Y,"Soft acting, but over all a really good movie. It hits the nail on the head as to how real porn has infiltrated the very depths of our society and a man that has overcome. She has to work through a lot of issues that haunt her, but she deals with it and is able to move on with her life, though painfully. The ending was a little bit of a cute surprise. Enjoy this emotional but faith-focused movie.",1521849600,,399,4.063291139240507
8628324,5,B00GX7WN0Y,"Very real circumstances in the movie as they fight against the ""beast"" of pornography for her son.  This movie gives hope to those lost in addiction, to find a way out with Jesus's help. This movie shows the benefits of the 12 step addiction recovery program. It also shows how pornography destroy families without Jesus. Inspiring female lead whose faith in Christ helps her overcome all odds.  Great film!",1521417600,,407,4.884057971014493
8628325,3,B00GX7WN0Y,"This is one of the myriad Christian movies out there now; it is good, clean, wholesome, and deals with some sensitive issues (divorce, pornography addiction) in a thoughtful way.  But I found some of the characters less than believable.  It didn't draw me in, as I had hoped it would.  Satisfying ending, but I likely won't watch it again.  There are better religious movies out there, in my opinion.",1520208000,,400,4.753623188405797

8628327,5,B00GX7WN0Y,Great movie for anyone going through tough times and just going through life!,1517616000,,77,5.0
8628328,1,B00GX7WN0Y,"Big disappointment and not at all uplifting of my faith. Basically it is a movie about the pain a woman experiences from divorce and how she allows her children to manipulate and influence her instead of her standing strong in her faith and being a Godly example for them. Basically her unmarried daughter (teenager or young adult) encourages her to date as well as a coworker advising her to ""shop"" around.
Then her younger teenage son appears to be suffering from depression and is unmotivated and lies that he has been doing his homework while not turning in any homework. The teacher out of the blue contacts the mother with his concern about her son failing the class.
Very cheesy, her solution is to help him clean his room and then throw him a party for doing that task WITH HER HELP. Talk about enabling and coddling.
Meanwhile she is head over heels in a ""love at first sight"" encounter with a fellow cyclist she met on the road. She prays and believes this is God's providence when it seems she does not know the Lord at all and has been focused on her circumstances the entire time (the hurt which is normal but the test is if you allow that to be a transformative experience of surrender to God, allowing you to become ""Christlike"").
I tried to give this movie a chance but could not finish halfway through because it did nothing for me and was not uplifting to my faith.
This movie is why our culture has so much divorce in the first place. I was really looking forward to watching a powerful faith building film but the movie Uphill Battle was nothing but a facade for pro-divorce.
I don't watch many movies and rarely watch one a second time but War Room is a film I would watch again and again. Sadly, it is not included in Prime membership so I finally went out and bought it and it was SO worth it! This movie is not so don't waste your time. Spend that time seeking God's truth in biblical study which will make you feel a lot better as well as mature your faith.",1516924800,,1982,4.388586956521739
8628329,5,B00GX7WN0Y,Great movie about hope for divorcees and addicts alike.  Also highlights the importance and power of prayer.,1515801600,,108,5.352941176470588
