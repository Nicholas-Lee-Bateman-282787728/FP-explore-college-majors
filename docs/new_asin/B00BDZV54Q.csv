5581882,3,B00BDZV54Q,"OOGA BOOGA is the latest assault from Charles Band and Full Moon Pictures.  With its usual lame effects, silly plotting and horrible acting, OOGA BOOGA is just what you'd expect---it's a hoot!
The simplistic and predictably inane story follows a college-bound African-American young man who is gunned down by a racist crooked cop, who takes orders from an even more racist judge.  The deceased's spirit enters the Ooga Booga doll given to the boy by a washed-up star of a TV kiddie show.  Ooga teams up with his grieving girlfriend to get revenge.  It's all quite comical!
The film's highlight is the appearance of Karen Black as the feisty trailer park manager.  Fans may recall Black's memorable role in the TV movie TRILOGY OF TERROR in which she is terrorized by a native doll, not unlike Ooga Booga.  There is one scene that is an exact homage to TRILOGY's climax.
Stacy Keach plays the judge in a twisted impersonation of Boss Hogg.
It's really bad but so cheesy you can't help but enjoy it!",1364688000,5,997,4.7011494252873565
5581883,3,B00BDZV54Q,"Devin (Wade Forrest Wilson) just passed his medical examines and is on his way to a great life as a doctor. Through a number of unfortunate circumstances his soul is transferred into a doll due to a short in a convenience store ""Slurshy"" machine. With the aid of his girlfriend Donna (Ciarra Carter) they seek to avenge his death against the racist cop Mike White (Gregory Niebel) and the drug dealers who work for him.

The title is racist as well as the doll with a bone through its nose. This was acknowledge within the film as well as other racist stereotypes. The film makes some of its characters deliberately racist. The dialouge, script, and brief gore effects are all light, campy, Troma style. The acting was also bad, most likely by design also. Amber Strauser, former cheerleader, opens the film as a ""Daisy Duke"" hostess for a kid's program.

Karen Black and Stacy Keach which headline this film have minor roles. For those who are immature enough to enjoy the Troma style films, they might find some enjoyment in this low budget feature.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief rape, nudity (Ciarra Carter, porn star Siri of ""Gazongas 7""...I think you get the idea.) 2 1/2 stars.",1364256000,,1184,4.737864077669903

5581925,3,B00BDZV54Q,"I am absolutely flabbergasted that this movie could be made in this era even by Charles Band and Full Moon. I would have never known about this movie if a friend of mine, Patrick Holder, hadn't told me about it; he's a serious actor and has a minor part in it as the twitchier of the robbers, Zero. He does an excellent job with his small part, and from a purely acting point of view, that's the norm in this film: most of the performances are workmanlike and competent despite the material. The film stars Stacy Keach and Karen Black, and while they have both done much better things, they have both also turned in worse performances too. Side note: watch for the excellent Patrick Holder nasal trauma scene, but I'm getting ahead of myself....

The film opens with a long segment of Hambo the pig clown (Chance A. Rearden), who is both disgusting and has the worst doll collection in history. There is a dynamic that I find hard to fully grasp between Hambo and Devin (Wade F. Wilson), the ill-fated young doctor, who is decidedly in the wrong place at the wrong time, and is shot by racist cops while getting a rhubarb Slurpee. Stacy Keach is the corrupt judge who profits from drugs and prostitution and protects the murderous cops. Meanwhile Devin has now inhabited the hilarious doll with a bone through his nose, Ooga Booga, and is plotting his revenge. There are amusing scenes as Ooga Booga tries to convince the love of his life he's really Devin (there's even a shower scene which must be seen to be believed) and of course the bulk of the second half of the film focuses on doll vengeance. The film could be seen as a serious commentary on race, though I'm not sure Full Moon is especially interested in that; that the movie can be construed as offensive to some is beyond doubt, but nobody is forcing anyone to watch this at gunpoint. (I hope.) Ooga Booga finally gets his revenge (please note the highly unusual apple of death scene) and the film ends on a predictable note (if you've seen other Charles band films).

I really have mixed feelings about ""Ooga Booga"". On one hand it raises the race card (the villains are all white, the heroes are largely black) for no good reason and with no good payoffs, but on the other hand it is more interesting than most of Band's other projects, like ""The Evil Bong"" series, and does have some disturbing (if sometimes hilarious) scenes of one very angry doll, itself a stereotype of the worst possible sort. I did enjoy the scene in which the robbers smoke the videotape from a surveillance camera in a bong. Was it an Evil Bong? Given the rest of the movie, I think it has to be.

This is definitely an exploitation flick, but who does it exploit exactly? In the end, just about everybody.",1436659200,4,2747,4.5120481927710845

5581927,2,B00BDZV54Q,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I usually love the 'so bad its good' type movie like The Room, and ThanksKilling, but this movie was kinda terrible. The preview to this movie is really misleading into making you think it'll be good for a few laughs, but please don't waste your time. The first 20 minutes are almost pointless about some drunk actor named Hambo, then we finally get to Devin's story. Devin is a young African American man who's about to go to Med School and has a beautiful girlfriend, but it's all taken away when he's at the wrong place at the wrong time. Of course, the police officers gun him down because of his race (Ferguson) and his soul is somehow transferred into a doll named Ooga Booga. (For some reason, he can't talk. He can just make bwahaha voices, like he's trying to be scary) Ooga and his girlfriend track down everyone involved in his death and gets revenge. I would not recommend OOGA BOOGA!!!",1415318400,,942,4.514619883040936

5581930,1,B00BDZV54Q,A REALLY disappointing. Charles Band movie that fails as a horror movie and fails as a comedy. Watch the trailer online because it's a lot funnier than this crapfest.,1398729600,,166,4.758620689655173
5581931,5,B00BDZV54Q,"Bought it for my girlfriend. we both love Full Moon Productions. I'm more for the Puppet master Series, but enjoy the classical animatronics that are so rarely seen in new movies of today.
I think most people find this movie a bit too racy and vulgar (just read online reviews) but all in all it's more of a revenge type movie with plenty of T&A thrown in (just like most full moon productions).
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that is easily offended by racial stereotypes.",1394496000,3,476,4.546511627906977
5581932,5,B00BDZV54Q,"Great movie on racism. All the right ingredients.

5581954,3,B00BDZV54Q,"I actually won this DVD free at a convention but after reading some of the other reviews for Ooga Booga I had to add my two cents. First off if your gonna watch a movie with title like Ooga Booga,then why not go in with an open comedic mind. Geezzz... If you are the sorta of person that loves racist comedy mixed with a little bit of horror,  then why not go ahead and watch this one. Its not that bad!",1380067200,4,403,3.9753086419753085
5581955,1,B00BDZV54Q,"I enjoy a lot of low budget horror movies but there was nothing to enjoy about this movie. I heard it had some humor but after the first few minutes I did not even see any attempts at humor. The acting was poor. The editing was really poor as well. There were many scenes that went on forever that did not even need to be in the movie at all. The story was lame. The doll showed no emotion or character, even during the poorly done kill scenes.",1376956800,,444,4.056818181818182
5581956,2,B00BDZV54Q,"Just when I thought Full Moon was making a comeback with Killjoy Goes to Hell....we get this. Ooga Booga actually could have been alot better than what it was. It simply fell flat on its face. Lame story, lame acting, and the only positive I could see was the Ooga Bogga character itself was realistic looking ,and had his moments of comedy. Since he couldn't talk though it was pretty limited. I won't re-write the story , as other reviewers already have done it well. Come on Full Moon! Get serious, or fold. Sadly, Puppet Master has been ruined beyond repair with those absolutely terrible part 9 ,10 etc. etc. I won't even get into those pathetic Gingerdead Man movies. Bottom line,youve had too many flops over the last 5+ years to make something this bad. Us old school Full Moon fans still have a slice of faith in you, hope your next effort is a whole lot better than this.",1374796800,,881,4.478260869565218

5581958,3,B00BDZV54Q,"This is actually a very funny movie that does not take itself too seriously.

5581960,4,B00BDZV54Q,First off..I love Karen Black. She reprises her scene from the Trilogy of terror where she crouches down tapping a butcher knife on the floor. Although this film is over the top with racial remarks....tar baby...cracker...spearchucker and so on its a hoot. A young doctor is killed by a racist cop after a robbery and an electrical charge puts his spirit into a doll. There is a scene where his girlfriend is taking a shower and the doll masturbates. Its cheesy but hey what Charles Band movie isnt. If you love seeing Stacy Keach and Karen Black you'll love it. Anyone who is easily sensative...STAY CLEAR!,1365465600,4,607,4.735849056603773
5581961,1,B00BDZV54Q,God cmon charles band. Stop making crap. This is one of your worst movies ever. The whole RACE thing has been done to death. Its old. Tgis is a borinf ultra cheesy movie with crap acting.  Please for the love of god put your money into one or two good movies a year instead of pure crap ever three months.  Like a new trancers movie. Or a arcade sequel.  Or maybe a bad channels sequel.  Get back to your roots. 1990 -1996. I kno theres no more paramount funding but u can think of something. And p.s please bring more amd more of your movies to blu ray. Like older ones. Its what most fans want. We love dvd too. But blu ray would be great too:) well im not giving up on fullmoon just yet(been a loooong time fan)but if they keep making crap like this and dead want women amd phppet master axis evil amd rising. Them im done buying movies from fullmoon. Anyway this movie blows. DON'T WATCH! hope mr band makes another great movie next:) only time will tell.,1364860800,,959,4.224043715846994
5581962,5,B00BDZV54Q,"Ooga Booga is the latest flick from Full Moon. Just like a lot of Full Moon's output, it's campy and fun. Actually, this one is even more campy and fun than usual. It's the best Full Moon movie since Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver! Karen Black is a hoot and steals the movie in her two scenes. Stacy Keach is also funny in an I-know-I-shouldn't-be-laughing sort of way as a racist judge. The death scenes are good, but not great. But who needs great death scenes, when you've got plenty of laughs? There's also some nudity, and a great opening featuring Hambo, an over the top children's TV Show host. Ooga Booga has it all, and I hope there is a sequel. Seeing as how a ton of Full Moon's movies have been turned into franchises, I don't see why not.",1364688000,9,761,4.366197183098592
