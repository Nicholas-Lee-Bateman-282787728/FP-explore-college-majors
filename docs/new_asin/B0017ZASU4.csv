8267896,3,B0017ZASU4,"Dr. Hu's Tripod and Spiral DVD as part of the Wild Goose Qigong is a good DVD as long as the practitioner is not a virtual beginner.  The video does not explain the relevant details as to why certain motions are used.  The DVD seems to assume that the practioneer has some understanding of the basics of qigong (meridians, qi fields, pulling qi from heaven or earth etc.)and the movements that either bring qi into the body or move it around the body.

That being said, the only other problem I had with DVD is the lack of repition of the form.  Dr. Hu moves very fast and doesn't explain the details of each motion.  The leaves the practioner with one had on the remote control and the other moving around trying to grasp the form as rewind is constantly hit to watch the form progress.  It can be frustrating and challenging to those used to well made qigong DVDs where the forms are explained in detail (YMAA, Dragon Door's Five Animal Frolics).  Nevertheless, I give the DVD three starts because the form is beautiful and hits some primary meridians of the body.  Dr. Hu obviously is an experienced qi practioner and understands the form he is teaching.  Too bad he doesn't explain it as well.  3 stars.

For a more detailed understanding of qigong, anything from YMAA is great.  Once the basics are understood, Dr. Hu's material is much more informative and fun.",1216684800,5,1367,4.557377049180328
8267897,5,B0017ZASU4,"This is the third Wild Goose QiGong DVD that I've purchased featuring Master Hu from ""Three Geese"", and I continue to be very pleased with the quality of both the material and the presentations of the DVDs themselves. This simple, elegant form is demonstrated and taught in a way that even a beginning student of QiGong (chi kung) can understand and learn well enough to derive considerable benefit from dedicated practice.

I especially appreciate the way the videographer presents the material featuring Master Hu in a variety of settings and from a variety of angles - by the shore of the ocean, in the studio, in a class setting with students, in a local wooded area, etc. This adds a lot to the sheer enjoyment of watching the material and gives the viewer subtle encouragement to practice this form wherever they happen to be.

Someday, somehow, I need to get out to California and attend one of Master Hu's seminars. I am sure that it will be well worth it!",1162080000,3,964,4.6647058823529415
