the story meanders between 4 forlorn lovelorn women - a bleak - slow paced drama - with some sex scenes - and much misery - this is a mood piece for which you really have to be in the mood

the actresses are pretty good tho - my favorite being Ikewaki Chizuru - the little one who appears in the comic opening scene - and who prays for the death of a man who grabbed her butt - then reverses the prayer when he admits to being attracted to her - then prays again for his death

the woman who works as a prostitute has given up on love - she's not real young anymore - and intends to kill herself at the first signs of aging - she lives alone except for a black fish swimming alone in a large empty aquarium - and she sleeps in a coffin

the forth woman i didn't find as interesting except for her prettiness

i've run out of things to say about the movie",1316131200,,1076,3.8727272727272726
