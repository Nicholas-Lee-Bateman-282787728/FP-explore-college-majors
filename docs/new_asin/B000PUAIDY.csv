2828083,4,B000PUAIDY,"Some things are not time correct, for example balloons, etc.  But those are just minor things.  The movie itself has catchy tunes, being that it is a musical and definitely can see this being a broadway hit potential.  My only thing that I was a little apprehensive about was the little girl in the story(her mother is telling the story of Esther), is expected to fast?  She must be about 9 or 10 years of age.  Usally the catholic faith talks about fasting when the kids are 18 years of age.  I bought this DVD for my faith formation class, I don't think the boys will love it, but I can definitely see the girls loving this film. The story is definitely pretty close to the bible and the story is easy to understand.",1309910400,,718,4.32089552238806
2828084,4,B000PUAIDY,"Because we our selves are practising for our musical of Ester, I came by this DVD. The songs I saw on youtube made me curious. The musical is entertaining, very funny and nicely sung. Especially over the top Haman does it for me.",1301270400,2,229,4.348837209302325
2828085,4,B000PUAIDY,"Yes, it's a little cheesy, but my kids love it!  I love that when I looked up the story of Esther in my Bible, so much of this movie is Biblically Correct!  There were a few things in the movie that I thought they were making up, but was pleasantly surprised to see that they were just parts of the story that I hadn't picked up before.  This is a fun to watch movie with great music, a wonderful message, and is amazingly close to the ""real"" account!",1297209600,17,451,4.1022727272727275
2828086,4,B000PUAIDY,"Some parts are slow, but  my 5 y.o. asks to watch it every week. By far the ""what a king wants"" song really makes the movie.",1272672000,3,124,3.769230769230769
2828087,5,B000PUAIDY,"I can remember celebrating Purim when I was a small child, and feeling very special to dress up as Esther.  This movie captures that feeling.

The music is enchanting, the colors, costumes and sets are bright, and the story is easy to follow.  This is a movie that is both for adults and for children.  This is one of the movies that is selected most often at my house.

The Liken The Scriptures movies pair the real-world problems of children with a scriptural story that highlights how to find a solution, allowing us to ""liken the scriptures unto ourselves.""",1268956800,13,561,4.626262626262626
2828088,5,B000PUAIDY,We thought this movie was really entertaining.  It teaches a great Old Testament story but is light enough that our kids enjoyed it and wanted to watch it again.,1268956800,2,161,4.551724137931035
2828089,5,B000PUAIDY,"This movie teaches so many great lessons - and is so entertaining at the same time. My favorite scenes are ""What More Could a King Want"" and ""It's Great to Be the King To Be.""  - fun costumes, makeup, dancing - a real musical-theater-on-film kind of movie.",1179446400,4,256,4.446808510638298
2828090,5,B000PUAIDY,I love this movie and so do my children. It is great.,1471651200,,53,3.5
2828091,5,B000PUAIDY,So cute! Fun Sunday movie. My little girl loves it!,1467331200,,51,4.2
2828092,1,B000PUAIDY,I didn't realize it was a musical,1465344000,,33,3.857142857142857
2828093,2,B000PUAIDY,not for me,1465257600,,10,2.6666666666666665
2828094,1,B000PUAIDY,really lame. I should have watched the previews. It was geared towards elementary age I think. There is a WONDERFUL version called ESTHER starring Ben Kingsley on The Bible Story Series (F. Murray Abraham) excellent...better than One NIght With the King.,1465084800,,254,5.219512195121951
2828095,3,B000PUAIDY,Good for kids and preteens,1464652800,,26,4.4
2828096,5,B000PUAIDY,"A fun, faith promoting and family friendly DVD filled with great songs and a great message about courage. My whole family LOVES this movie and watches it over and over. Great for the Sabbath day. We love the LIken the Scriptures movies!",1464220800,,236,4.642857142857143
2828097,3,B000PUAIDY,"When I bought this, I thought it was a regular movie.  However, it is the musical version of Esther and The King.  I had seen this on TV when it first came out.  Now I will give it to my little niece and nephew to enjoy.",1457568000,,220,3.739130434782609
2828098,5,B000PUAIDY,This is a fun spin on a wonderful story.,1457308800,,40,3.5555555555555554
2828099,5,B000PUAIDY,"This is a charming musical version most suitable for, I suppose, ages four to eight.  The treatment of the story is fun and lighthearted without going too far by making light of it.  There seems to be some controversy in the reviews as to its Biblical accuracy.  No, if you're looking for a straight dramatization of exactly what's in the Bible, this isn't it.  But I'm a long-time Sunday school teacher, and it meets my expectations for being basically faithful while still putting the material on a level that will be engaging for children, the result being that they're exposed to Esther's story and what it means.  That's what's important at this age; they can study the more-complex adult version when they're old enough to fully appreciate it.  The only liability I can see in it is that, in the frame story of a present-day mom telling her daughter about Esther, the value of fasting is explained and encouraged, and Esther models it in the main story.  Depending on your family, that concept might fall into the realm of being a little too fundamentalist or maybe just not something kids need to be thinking about; but although it's mentioned and discussed, it's not dwelt on or shoved down the viewer's throat, so a parent could easily emphasize or de-emphasize it to correspond with what works for their family and it would be seamless either way.  I feel this DVD is suitable for a wide variety of families who have different levels of interest in their faith (I'm familiar with it from previous experience and I'm buying it now as a gift for a child who enjoys Bible stories and whose family is casually Christian but not practicing particularly actively; it will fit the bill for them, but would work just as well for families who were regular churchgoers, etc.).  Overall, I consider this an excellent product.  I'm not familiar with the other installments of the series, but I imagine they're probably of similar quality and I will look into them as well.",1449273600,,1970,4.733918128654971
2828100,1,B000PUAIDY,The picture quality was so poor we couldn't watch it.,1446422400,,53,4.4
2828101,5,B000PUAIDY,My dvd arrived in excellent condition and it's very close to the bible story.,1442361600,,77,4.571428571428571
2828102,1,B000PUAIDY,low budget film.. they did not spend much money to make this film...,1440374400,,68,4.3076923076923075
2828103,1,B000PUAIDY,Thought it was the movie about Esther. It is a bad musical,1437523200,,58,3.9166666666666665
2828104,5,B000PUAIDY,Inspires people to stand up in what they believe in and to not back down.,1434844800,,73,3.933333333333333
2828105,4,B000PUAIDY,"Yes, it's campy, corny, and definitely lacks the historical context and knowledge of Jewish history. That aside, my kids love this movie. The songs are catchy and silly, and the outtakes are pretty hilarious if you buy it on DVD. Clean and safe for kids.",1434412800,,254,4.666666666666667
2828106,2,B000PUAIDY,Didn't like the acting.,1426377600,,23,5.0

2828113,3,B000PUAIDY,It was mildly entertaining.,1406246400,,27,6.0
2828114,5,B000PUAIDY,"I really liked this movie, very cute and fun.  I liked how it was told modern day and flashed back to the biblical time of Queen Esther.  In the flashback the scenes are played much like a local theater musical production.  Very cute concept! Esther is so beautiful and captivating to watch.  Clean and fun, totally enjoyable and appropriate to share in church studies, home with friends and with children.

I rented it first on my Kindle, liked it so much I decided to buy it on DVD to share with my church and friends.",1402963200,3,520,4.431578947368421
2828115,5,B000PUAIDY,She loved it ! Several times over the past few weeks I have called her and she will tell me she watched the movie Esther and The King again so the investment was totally worth every penny.,1401926400,,188,4.108108108108108
2828116,1,B000PUAIDY,this is not  what i expect to be  a hold look of singing this is not Esther and the king that i remember from the bible version i want the one from the bible version if you  don't have then for get it too much singing,1400544000,,217,3.6739130434782608

2828118,4,B000PUAIDY,I love all of the story from the Bible they help to give me a visual when reading the Bible.,1399680000,2,92,3.65
2828119,5,B000PUAIDY,it's a fun family movie. it's a biblical movie for older children. it's something for them when the cartoons movies aren't for them anymore.,1398038400,2,140,4.875
2828120,5,B000PUAIDY,"Hi. This film was very well done and although it is a musical, the integrity of this beloved Bible history has not been infringed upon.  I really enjoyed it.",1397088000,2,157,4.413793103448276
2828121,4,B000PUAIDY,"Great for young children!  If I had small kids, this would be the movie to show them!  It was very well done.",1395273600,,109,3.909090909090909
2828122,4,B000PUAIDY,This LIken your Scriptures video is great.  We really like Liken The Scriptures.  Esther & the King teaches the Bible Concept of how to face challenges in your everyday life.  The songs are beautiful and they always have a little bit of fun humor.  It is filmed like a play.  It is a fun video,1386720000,,293,4.254545454545455
2828123,5,B000PUAIDY,"Loved this movie. At first I was a little unsure about it. This was our first ""Liken"" movie and I was expecting a more serious and bigger budget film. It was more like a really good musical play. I didn't think it would hold the attention of my 6 year old and 3.5 year old, but they loved it, and ask to watch it every Sunday. There are a few silly songs, and the story is not perfect, of course (like for example, Ester reveals to the king that her people are in danger during the first feast she invites them to -  but you have to forgive a little difference and just teach them the real scripture story later. This sets a great foundation for interest in the OT story, and leaves them with a picture in their mind that will really bring the story to life). This is a family favorite for sure :)",1385683200,2,797,4.108974358974359
2828124,3,B000PUAIDY,"Funny play musical type show.  It is simply done, and goofy, but quite nice.  Quite decent, and some catchy songs.",1385337600,,114,4.65
2828125,5,B000PUAIDY,A great movie! I originally saw this movie online. It is so much nicer to have my own copy!!! Watched it with my grandkids!,1384214400,,123,4.166666666666667

2828127,4,B000PUAIDY,"Although told with a bit of comedy, this is a great rendition of a great Bible story. We need more movies and more heroes like Esther.",1373068800,,134,4.1923076923076925
2828128,5,B000PUAIDY,I have One night with the King so went to see other story tell of Esther and King. She is a hero to do the thing safe people,1368144000,,124,3.4642857142857144
2828129,5,B000PUAIDY,It reminds me of music theater productions done in school (with a bit higher caliber actors).  I Love the music and the characters!,1367193600,,131,4.695652173913044
2828139,5,B000PUAIDY,I'm in love with musical/broadway. I was so tickled to know that the Lord uses talents and gifts to produce this movie. It's a wholesome movie for the whole family who love a Christian musical play with Christian values. I LOVE IT. I sing along with it. Watched it over and over. hehehe. TO God be the Glory.,1366675200,,308,4.327586206896552
2828140,5,B000PUAIDY,"I was pleasantly surprised by this fun and upbeat movie.  It was well made (in made for TV movie standards). My girls love the songs related to the fair maidens trying to woo the king.  The movie has little bits of humor and whit hidden in every scene, which made me even want to watch it a second time.  It followed the story well too. Lightstone did a great job of making Esther wholesome and true to her beliefs.  My 4 year old just told me ""Esther was so brave to save her people.  I can be brave too"".  I would recommend it to any Christian family that enjoys musicals and humor while learning gospel principles.",1362873600,,617,4.275862068965517
2828141,4,B000PUAIDY,"I have to disagree with reviews that say this film is Biblically  correct, it is not. It does give the same general idea, but there are things added and things missing that would have helped the story. Hollywood has a hard time with Biblical stories because TRUTH is not in their vocabulary, so they do not understand why the audience does not like a story that THEY made better. This movie is closer then most. I like to have my grandchildren watch the movie and then play a game of who can find the most mistakes. That way, they get to watch the movie and they learn the truth at the same time. It also instills in them to question what they are told and read the word for themselves.",1362441600,9,686,4.276923076923077
2828142,5,B000PUAIDY,All I wanted to do was sing along.  I even imagines myself living in that time when it was up to Esther to save her people!  I loved the actor that played Hamen :),1361577600,2,163,3.764705882352941
2828143,5,B000PUAIDY,My kids got several DVDs for Christmas and this is the one they watch over and over.  Love the fact that it has a female lead.,1357776000,,126,3.8461538461538463
2828144,4,B000PUAIDY,"Really an excellent video.  Depicts the story very accurately, which keeping it fun and entertaining for the kids.  The result, my kids love this important Bible story, know the story by heart, and have learned some fun songs along the way.",1357171200,7,240,4.829268292682927
2828145,5,B000PUAIDY,"This is a fun movie for kids of all ages.  The younger ones will learn about the story of Esther.
The story line moves fast",1356480000,,123,3.92
2828146,2,B000PUAIDY,"I didn't like this movie really. It was almost typical of what hollywood does when they either don't have the facts as to the events they are using as a basis for the movie, or they prefer to change it according to their belief system. Believe me, the bible account is quite exciting enough. I am particularly fond of this account for oh so many reasons. I noticed that this was popular, and without really paying attention to the product notes, I got sucked into looking at it. I would only recommend others see this movie to compare with another to see the difference. The problem is, when you see the other (as there are a number of these movies out there), you really don't want to revisit this one again.",1343779200,,709,4.419847328244275
2828147,1,B000PUAIDY,"The video quality was good, but I hate musicals!  I wish there was a better selection of these types of movies.",1336521600,,111,4.285714285714286
2828148,4,B000PUAIDY,"I enjoyed this musical version of Esther and my elementary age daughter really enjoyed it as well. My teenage daughter was disappointed.  It's not an expensively done production but the singing was outstanding, uses quality actors and I appreciated the many positive messages about love and what love is not.  Esther was my favorite cast member and Haman is my least favorite because in this lighthearted version he is  silly instead of just evil.  Nice for very young kids as I can't even imagine a kid being afraid of him or getting nightmares.  The script doesn't exactly mesh perfectly with the King James version but flows well and would be a nice family movie.  It talks about fasting and wanting to invite a friend to church.  I'd rent it before you buy it just in case it's not exactly what you're looking for.  One of my friends was so excited when I mentioned we'd ordered it and said it was her family's favorite movie.  It was a gift for my teenager and she was not impressed but the rest of us will enjoy it.",1325635200,2,1021,4.505434782608695
