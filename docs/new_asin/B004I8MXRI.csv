4384240,5,B004I8MXRI,"So I was surfing IFC and found Armadillo. Watched it. If you have ever been in contact this documentary will allow you to revisit the sound of bullets passing your head. In one contact, they are so close you can hear the Taliban shouting. In another, a classic trench assault w/ hand grenade is used.

More importantly, it deals with the struggles on both sides. Civilians getting hurt by Taliban shoot and scoot from your compound tactics. Danes trying to patrol enough to push the Taliban north where the war won't impact the civilians as much. Taliban posing as civilians to get money to buy weapons, only to be killed by the very people who paid them. Danes watching their friends get hit with IEDs, getting shot and monotony.

Extremely delicate topics are discussed. The farmer who has his house bombed (right or not isn't presented), and replies ""How should we know? Maybe it's our fault? What can we do?...."". Platoon Commander Rasmus is hit by an IED and talks about the experience while recovering. The speech he gives to the platoon about the actions regarding the grenade / ditch contact; relating personal strength and ability to determine actions of an opponent responsible for wounding 3 of your friends, sitting with an AK under a log in a ditch, and the level of doubt required to make the decision to fire or expose yourself to an armed man was the most eloquent description of the thought process of a combat soldier witnessed.",1323820800,11,1446,4.734126984126984
4384241,4,B004I8MXRI,"""Armadillo"" - compared to 2010's ""Restrepo"" - really has some of the most intense battle action of the crop of Iraq/Afghanistan war documentaries of the Iraq/Afghan Wars era. The interesting thing is this movie follows DANISH soldiers, serving there as part of ISAF, who are stationed at a base - called Armadillo - in southern Afghanistan. In many cases they - and we - see the Taliban, from the viewpoint of the little radio-controlled drone airplane that they launch by hand daily, and we see the soldiers go on patrol and confront them in the nearby villages. Also too we see them contronting the local dwellers of those villages in sit-down meetings where they protest ""You bombed my field."" ""You bombed my cow"". ""You bombed my house."" ""They don't shoot at you, they come and kill US!"" And they pay the villagers 1500 dollars for their losses. Ideally, I DO kinda' wish they could have done almost a reality show type approach - with cameras just EVERYWHERE shooting EVERYTHING and editing it all together so as to tell more of the story of this place and the people there. As it is, it's as much as could be done by the director and the camera man - who actually gets shot at one point - getting what they do, and it's still quite A LOT, and it illuminates a great deal of the experience of the war there. It's really an intense snapshot, but at the same time you realize this is just one little piece of what went on there and there's more intense stuff that's never been recorded.",1323388800,,1488,4.514814814814815
4384242,4,B004I8MXRI,"Enjoyed the film (nice historical reference hearing Danes calling watch towers ""sangars"" while working with the Brits).  My overall feelings in 17 syllables:

Danish troops, Helmand.
Firefight peak experience.
But who was the snitch?",1321488000,,233,5.823529411764706
4384243,5,B004I8MXRI,"I didn't go see ""Armadillo"" in the theaters. I didn't even rent the DVD. In fact, I had never heard of it until a few weeks ago when I came across it on IFC while channel surfing. The description looked interesting, and since the opening credits were still rolling I decided to give it a try. It turns out that I made a pretty good decision.

This film documents the six-month tour of a Danish military unit at Camp Armadillo, a forward operating base in southern Afghanistan. Much like ""Restrepo"" it was filmed by embedded journalists, took place around the same timeframe and in the same country (though on the opposite side), included pre- and post-tour footage from the soldiers' respective home countries, and features a small team of Allied forces engaging the Taliban.

I'm a big fan of historical films and war epics, and have seen a fair amount of movies and documentaries about global events, conflict, armed forces and government intelligence. As an American, I love a good civil war story, WWII drama and CIA thriller. But I also like to explore foreign films of the same genres -- to see what these topics/events/stories are like in other cultures. Sure, we might get an occasional glimpse at an ally country (James Bond movies) or opposition/enemy (""Valkyrie"" / ""U-571"" / ""Hunt for Red October""), but these typically only give us superficial perspectives. So one of the things I really enjoyed about ""Armadillo"" is that it provides a unique, raw, behind-the-scenes look at what wartime military life is like in another country (Denmark) -- from how the families cope with the fear & anxiety of having loved ones in harm's way, to how their troops react in combat.

Regardless of the ""rules of engagement"" controversy that ensued when this film came out (which I won't go into because it involves a spoiler of sorts), I was really impressed by how well-trained and prepared the young Danish soldiers were. I don't know why, but I wasn't expecting that. Although Denmark is much smaller than the U.S. (roughly half the size of South Carolina) and our countries may not have a lot in common, life in Afghanistan for Danish and American troops seems almost identical. They appear to receive similar training, use a lot of the same equipment, follow the same protocols, conduct the same types of operations, and have similar camp ""cultures."" Even the familial and societal dynamics felt familiar. While many Europeans (IMHO) harbor bitter ""it's all America's fault that we're in this"" anti-war sentiments, the Danish civilians in this film seemed more sympathetic to the war effort, displayed a lot of patriotism and national pride, and showed strong support for their troops. I was sincerely moved by the (all-too-familiar) emotional airport scenes where families are sending off their sons/brothers/boyfriends to war -- and then eventually welcoming them home.

As far as action goes, there are a handful of suspenseful combat scenes -- including one intense, up-close, bloody skirmish that involves several allied and combatant casualties. (This is the part that sparked the aforementioned controversy.) I don't think I've ever seen fighting that ""real"" where the camera was so close. At one point the cameraman, Taliban and Danish soldiers were within 10 yards of each other while exchanging gunfire and grenades.

But this film is about so much more than action/combat. It forced me to think about things that I totally wasn't expecting, and it did so in a very subtle way. For me, that's one of the hallmarks of a good documentary.",1318291200,30,3546,4.9730185497470485
4384244,5,B004I8MXRI,"The Anglo-American military involvement in Afghanistan has now dragged on for ten years, and sadly a lot of British and American soldiers have been killed, and that's not to mention the Afghans who have had it worse for longer. I bought and watched the documentaries Restrepo and Armadillo out of respect for the documentary makers who risked their lives to make these films, and to see what I could learn about this intractable conflict from watching them...

Restrepo is a truly brilliant documentary. The first thing to say about it is that it was made in co-operation with National Geographic, and was therefore politically constrained from the start. That's why there is no overt or explicit critique of US policy in the film, and little context-setting. Instead, the film makers rather cunningly went for realism, which becomes it's own critique. One scene after another makes you realise the total futility of trying to control and dominate a place like the Korengal Valley militarily. This documentary is really stunning, and could not get more real. The opening sequence, where the vehicle the cameraman is driving in hits an IED, is as shocking as anything else, perhaps the most shocking sequence. But there's plenty more action--the American soldiers come under fire almost every day, and when things are quiet they go out looking for a fight. The reviewer SCM rightly comments on the naivete of the American captain who attempts, but fails, to win the hearts and minds of the locals, who are after all the Taliban, or Taliban supporters. The brilliance of this documentary lay in the de-briefing interviews. In one of these interviews a soldier reflects on the bungled attempt to curry favour with the locals, ""...hearts and minds was not working--we're loud, we're obnoxious, we're immature at times; going in and acting like their friend doesn't work."" That was a glimmer of self-awareness coming through, after the event. Another soldier remarked, in response to the cliche that you did what you had to do, ""I didn't have to do any of it."" This awakening comes too late, one feels. There is so much more to say about this documentary, but I'll confine myself to the observation that it was superbly edited (by Michael Levine) and artfully filmed (by the late, great, Tim Hetherington) with beautiful sweeping shots, and many telling close-ups.

Watching Armadillo, which in its own way is a superb documentary, made an interesting counterpoint to Restrepo. This film is equally artful to Restrepo, but a more orthodox effort: the film makers take the traditional approach of following a group of soldiers from training to deployment. The documentary is beautifully shot borrowing classic cinematic technique and narrative. Some reviewers have commented that Armadillo is more real than Restrepo, somehow more engaged. I agree that the film makers get close to their subject--the Danish soldiers, who by turns come across as macho and spartan, and then not much more than schoolboy porno enthusiasts. The main subject followed is a young man who seems to be out to prove himself, which he finally does by getting wounded, much to everyone's admiration. The whole thing is such a joke, and that young man is headed for a lot of nightmares. But I digress. Back to the action: the Danes go out on a ""domination patrol"" (no irony!). The vanguard patrol move like a herd of elephants--the cameraman has lots of time to film civilians fleeing in advance of a firefight. On go the Danes, one of them falling over after losing his balance. Finally, bang, bang, bang. They bag some enemy. But the enemy hit back a couple of days later--""they're everywhere"", comments one of the Danish soldiers, referring to the Taliban. And indeed they are--they're all over this documentary. In both Restrepo and Armadillo we get to see the western soldiers talking to civilians, some of whom no doubt later pick up weapons to take a pop at the occupiers. Of course, you have to be sensitive to pick up on this, but it was as plain as day to me--and its exactly why the western armies will never win in Afghanistan: they don't know the enemy; the enemy, however, knows them all too well.

Both these documentaries are involved, engaging, and brilliantly filmed. I can't recommend one over the other--I recommend you watch them both.",1315440000,9,4323,4.951790633608815
4384245,5,B004I8MXRI,"Before this movie, there were war movies that were fiction, or at least scripted, and there were war documentaries, which were more educational than entertaining, and had none of the suspense, character development, or drama of the movies. This is the first film that actually makes something absolutely and completely real, and gives it the same qualities as the scripted films. This film takes you from a predeployment party in Denmark, to brutal firefights in Afghanistan. It provides a real life window into the lives, dilemma, and heartache of soldiers still in their teens. Masterfully shot and impeccably edited this is a truly amazing film and stands alone in concept and execution. This DVD is fantastic. It played fine in my USA player, had excellent picture quality and included a bunch of English subtitled special features. Great film and great DVD. Excellent purchase.

4384251,5,B004I8MXRI,"""Armadillo"" is the documentary story of a unit of Danish trooped who are deployed on a six month tour of Afghanistan at......you guessed it, a firebase called: Armadillo. The movie flows well from departing loved ones at home, to the boredom of deployment, to the actual combat experiences of the men in country. My own quip about this movie is, most of the men are portrayed as being jokesters about war and death (or porn hounds), and anyone who has ever served knows soldiers don't look at war in any way as a joking matter.

This film actually surprised me when I first watched it. I was expecting something of an anti-war docudrama about how terrible the ""Evil Empire"" of the U.S. currently is, but interestingly enough, it was a well thought out film about the trials and experiences of everyday Danish troops. I knew very little about Denmark's involvement in Afghanistan before this movie (I actually didn't know they even had troops over there), but the movie does a great job of introducing these allies and they acquit themselves very well. The film does tend to make light of the harshness of war, but I believe that troops deal with stress in many different ways. The battle scenes were incredibly well shot, and you actually feel like you have just been in a firefight! The movie also does a stupendous job of showing exactly why Afghanistan will never be conquered or be made to conform to western thinking. This nation simply does not want westerners interfering with their lives, and eventually I'd imagine the U.S. and its allies will have to wake up and take notice as well.

I really enjoyed the movie throughout. If you're no fan of military documentaries then you may find yourself tiring of the movie quickly as it tends to move slow in places; however, if you enjoy a good war flick then ""Armadillo"" is something to behold.",1398384000,2,1847,4.697530864197531
4384252,4,B004I8MXRI,Well shot. The Danish military is very different than the US military. That was interesting to see. It's also nice to see that the US is not alone in Afghanistan. Other countries are there dealing with the same hell we are.,1394323200,,223,4.463414634146342
4384253,5,B004I8MXRI,"If you are a follower of the subject, there is nothing to dislike about this documentary.  Young Danish soldiers, men

country and loved ones, in a place that has no resemblance whatsoever to their own world, they strive to do their military
duty... and survive.

4384254,5,B004I8MXRI,VIKINGS ARE STILL WALKING AMONG US! Fantastic doc with amazing footage and interviews. A must see if you liked Restrepo or Marjah. These Danes are no joke.,1382832000,,155,4.777777777777778
4384255,4,B004I8MXRI,"""Armadillo"" The documentary follows a group of Danish soldiers stationed at ISAF (International Security Assistance Force)'s Forward Operating Base ""Armadillo"" in Afghanistan, occupied by forces from the United Kingdom and Denmark. Their primary mission is to provide security to the area and to curtail the influence of Taliban, but performing their task in reality turns out more dangerous and complicated than expected.

Director Janus Metz's film captures what the frontline soldiers have to face. Sometimes it's boredom, as the soldiers are seen doing chores in the base or watching playing video games; sometimes it's nerve-wracking intensity or extreme danger, as they engage in fierce combat with Talibans. And you just cannot tell civilians from Talibans.

The documentary film is notable for its editing skills that are so slick and tactful that the combats with the Taliban soldiers start to look like scenes from Hollywood movies. The difference is that the Danish soldiers and the film crew were really there, and the bullets and deaths are real.

By keeping an objective stance, the film attempts to present the ongoing war as it is. The result is very authentic portraits of young soldiers struggling with reality.",1380153600,,1229,5.324742268041237

4384260,5,B004I8MXRI,"This 2001 British miniseries aired the following year in North America on A&E and was released by the network on VHS, but sadly no DVD seems to be available yet. That's unfortunate since I suspect that the plot, which revolves around mysterious goings-on at a powerful insurance company, would have even more appeal after the big-business scandals of recent years. The protagonist, a young man named Lorimer Black (James Frain), is a promising employee being mentored by the savvy eccentric George Hogg, wonderfully portrayed by Stephen Rea. Black, as it turns out, is not the person he appears to be. He's leading a double life, and the stress placed on him as he finds himself forced to choose between loyalty to his wealthy colleagues such as the buffoonish Torquil Helvoir-Jayne (Hugh Bonneville), and his real family, is both hilarious and thought-provoking. A crisis is triggered in Lorimer's life by the beautiful but distant Flavia (Catherine McCormack), an actress who haunts his dreams after he sees her in his company's new ad campaign. The scenes shift fluidly between suspense, romance, and comedy. Excellent performances by the two leads, with a strong supporting cast. True to William Boyd's novel, the background soundtrack features African music, by artists I'd never heard of before seeing this show ... and I actually went out and bought CDs by some of the artists, I was so intrigued. The website aboutjamesfrain.com summarizes the pieces used, and I'm going to repeat the list here since the information doesn't appear on the end credits.

For the most part, it was fair and was not biased either pro or anti-war.  The film does a good job of realistically portraying what service in Afghanistan is like.  The filmmaker does take some liberties in editing and filmography which make it seem slightly less like a documentary and more like a fictional film.  However, that was not a problem for me, and it was easy to tell it was all too real.  As both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were American-led, it was actually nice for a change to see what part other participants are playing such as the Danish.

4384266,5,B004I8MXRI,"This Danish military in Afghanistan documentary did not shy away from showing what we don't want to see. Having grown up with guns and killing for sport, later replaced by ROTC, I understand the biologically determined thrill of the hunt and for those who live in a sheltered urban environment it's surrogate in film/TV and PC/video gaming. Armadillo shows us how technology and killing at a distance has removed the human element from the act of killing thus transforming it into another form of a video game. The recent news video of pissing on Taliban is made more understandable in this film as both the conditioned unemotional training for reactive killing as well as the subsequent dehumanizing changes that are enhanced by combat. Nothing new there; it's as old as being human. But then again if one tallies all the reasons why people kill then combat is just the same, just a different venue.

Additionally, we see how the lack of education coupled with conservative religious indoctrination amongst the Afghan peoples leads to narrow simplistic views of life and a distrust of anything/anyone different (not unlike the comparable Christian conservatives). Also shown was how the Taliban are able to successfully manipulate the battlefield rules both in terms of the minds of the local population and in their hit and run tactics thus drawing the foreigners into fighting the people they are trying to protect.",1326499200,5,1418,5.05982905982906

What a wonderful documentary detailing a six month tour of Afghanistan by a Danish Company. We seem to stay with one platoon. Very up close and personal, we see the troops leaving Denmark, arriving in Afghanistan and going out on their operations. The name ""Armadillo"" comes from their Forward Operating Base where the guys, eat, sleep, work and play.

Something this documentary highlighted beautifully is that war can be endless hours, days, months of boredom interrupted by a few seconds of the most adrenaline inducing excitement you'll ever feel. These young men patrolled day after day with Stryker and Artillery cover usually turning up nothing. But once or twice they came into contact with the Taliban. As the viewer we are right on the line with them. It's fantastic stuff. They took one or two casualties and men from another platoon were lost.

We watch the men bond tighter and watch out for each other. There's some introspection by one or two of the men. It seems that their eyes hardened somehow as the documentary went on. I really enjoyed the ""fly on the wall"" camera aspect and it served to put me back in a uniform I last took off some 30 years ago. Realistic feel.

The main draw of the documentary is the up close, personal and candid aspect. There's no script. We watch young men goofing around during down time and patrolling, engaging and neutralizing a hardened enemy during work time. It's all in there.
