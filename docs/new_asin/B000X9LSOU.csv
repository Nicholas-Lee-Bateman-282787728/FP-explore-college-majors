8317373,2,B000X9LSOU,"I am a huge Jamie Oliver fan and was fascinated by his work with the UK school lunches. So I grabbed this DVD when I saw it.

This is SHORT - just 20 minutes for $15!!!  thought it was longer.
The content is OK, but the description here made it sound like much more. ""turned his attention to American schools""... uh - in this DVD he does a 10 minute interview with the news guy... that's ALL... and about 2/3 of the interview is not even with Jamie.

 Would have been OK for like $5 or even $8 - but NOT for the price of a full length movie and with no real NEW content for anyone already familiar with Jamie's UK School lunch reform.",1236124800,2,634,4.048
