8637310,5,B004W5MHP0,"This is an incredible product! As with all sheep snacks, this is a great resource for parents (especially) that will help to engage and facilitate (by using ""the Fridge"" devo questions)""God conversations"" with their kids. It's got spunky humor, engaging story lines & graphics, and unbeatable content (it's all Scripturally based). If you're looking for a great resource as a parent, or as a Christian worker who wants to equip parents, then you should for sure check out Sheep Snacks!
(P.S. I'm posting this review on ALL SIX Vids...since they're so wicked sweet!)",1309219200,,565,5.086021505376344
