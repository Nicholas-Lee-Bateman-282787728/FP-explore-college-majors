8227343,5,B000X9LS90,"There are 70+ books on TM which attempt to ""sell it"" to the American Public. However, TM is really ""Hinduism Lite"", packaged for the American public. Serious TM practitioners in the United States are asked to not tell people that the word they use to meditate on for hours is actually the name of a Hindu ""god"". However, in actuality, so-called Hindu gods are demons which ""have transformed themselves into angels of light"". Additionally, TM is a classic way to allow a Hindu god (actually a demon) to enter you and start influencing you. There are not hundreds or thousands of gods in the world---as claimed by Hindus, but rather one God (as Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans believe, some 2.5 billion people). So that means that other claimants to God's true throne are nothing but fallen angels who follow Satan, the principal deceiver.",1428710400,3,839,4.874125874125874

8227345,2,B000X9LS90,"A One sided, 1980's opinion piece by born again Christians that makes exclusive use of anecdotal testimony as the basis for its criticisms.  The film mainly consists of 4 long interviews that narrate the extreme views of both TM representatives and born again Christians. If you like TM, you'll hate this film. If you are a born again Christian, then its a rehash of things you've already heard and believe. If you are neutral on the issue of TM then you will be just plain bored with this low budget, poorly produced excuse for a film.",1391299200,2,536,4.583333333333333
8227346,1,B000X9LS90,"This is an ongoing fundamentalist christian belief (that's been around forever) that no one can be a christian unless you came to God in their prescribed manner.

If you don't, you're either a cult such as Mormons or simply (non) christian which would include the Catholic church.

Meditation has been in the past and is apparently still considered evil to the fundamentalist christian even though it's nothing more than prayer.

I can't understand why any Christian would promote such hate - isn't it the opposite of what Jesus taught.",1335312000,12,536,5.0
8227347,1,B000X9LS90,"The book reflects the fear in people.  The best way to answer such nonsense is with knowldge. I suggest the following link that provides scientific and empircal data on the TM practice.  [...]

Nuns, monks, priest, scientist,and atheist all practice TM and receive benefit. Fundamnetalist of any religion attempt to find dogma to live by rather than seeking truth.

8227348,1,B000X9LS90,"The book is a terrible reflection of fear and ignorance. I would refer people to the TruthAbout TM website that provides an intelliegent response to the value of the TM tecnique, written by Dr. David Orme-Johnson, who has published more than 100 scientific papers on the subject. TM is a technique used by people of every religion around the world without conflict.

As far as the money issues, I come from a developing nation where the generoisty of business leaders financed TM being offered for the Mayan Indian Families, and prisons. You do not pay for transcedning but there is a cost for the chair you sit in, and the electricity bill for the building in which the chair is located. Teaching TM is an honorable profession.  They pay pastors, educators, and numerous individuals who provide a humanitarian service to others. It is nonsense to not understand that money is needed to exist in our world.

The beenfits of TM have been verified by over six million people and scientific research. This book is an expression of a disrespectful and fanatical view. It would be better to provide appreciation to any effort that is focussed on improving society.",1326412800,17,1168,4.8542713567839195
8227349,2,B000X9LS90,"just finished watching this DVD....I must say, the announcer of this DVD was more scary than the idea of the TM movement being a cult!  I agree that the TM movement has religious elements in it, and they should disclose that the mantras they are giving to people have meaning, and are the names of hindu deities (from my understanding, they do not disclose this).

I do think it is a money making venture.  Obviously, the Maharishi was not a poor man.  It is my understanding that he owned several beautiful, expensive homes, cars, and had his own helicopter, and lots of money.  It's a convenient thing that he preached that you do not have to give up material goods and wealth, as he obviously did not.  I believe, currently, that the price for this 6 week initiation and mantra giving is now up to $2.500.00 per person!  That buys a lot of material stuff, doesn't it!

However, I did feel that the announcer is pretty scary too!  He says that TM is evil, and that some of the ex-practitioners had ""seen the devil"" until they found and was saved by the Lord and Jesus Christ.  I think this is untrue.  He obviously feels threatened by anyone who has an alternative view to what God is.  He seems narrow minded, intolerant of other viewpoints and beliefs, and demands total obedience to his God.  I also noticed that one ex follower was asked if he felt that TM's ceremony for new initiates was religious in nature, to which he replied, ""I didn't, at first, but when I got out of it, and accepted the Lord Jesus as my savior, I did think that it was in fact religious"".  He goes on to explain how he had become self centered and selfish while practicing TM.  To me, it was like he was saying that he didn't think he was doing anything wrong until his born again fellows told him that he was.

The announcer consistently claims throughout that God wants you to use your mind (think for yourself), and not to release yourself of your consciousness, as TM proponents suggest.  This whole thing of a born again christian or minister telling you what is evil does not sound like using your mind to me; it sounds like allowing others to decide for you what is right and what is wrong.

In my opinion, this whole presentation is like the pot calling the kettle black, instilling fear into others that the devil is going to get them if they meditate, and telling everyone what to think and what to believe.  They (christians) are right and good, and everyone who believes differently is wrong and evil.  As already mentioned, I do believe it is a financial scam, and that it has more religious elements than the teachers of TM are revealing.  I do not personally believe that advanced students can levitate or disappear.  To me, that is just silly, but I don't think meditation is inheirantly evil.  Perhaps instead, you could save your money, choose which religion or beliefs you wish for yourself, and just sit quietly a couple of times a day.  Perhaps also being kind to yourself and others, and not judging others would be good things to try too!",1252108800,22,3043,4.510948905109489
