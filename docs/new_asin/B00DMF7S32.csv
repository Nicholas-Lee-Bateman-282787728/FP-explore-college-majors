5833233,3,B00DMF7S32,"I have always been intrigued by all things Nazi, and this compilation of grindhouse style Nazi  themed moves is a perfect way  catch a glimpse at films you might have never heard of. I had to keep pausing the film so I could write down all the movies titles. Sex ,Torture and death exploitation , yeah, you wanna see this one!",1380067200,11,326,4.327868852459017
5833234,2,B00DMF7S32,"GrindhouseFlix's second original production is another trailer compilation in the same vein as BLOOD OF 1,000 VIRGINS-- Nazisploitation this go-round-- which includes segments and a host. The host is Michelle ""Bombshell"" McGee, but unlike the first production BLOOD OF 1,000 VIRGINS though, there's no sex appeal to be found. ""Bombshell"" delivers zero of the charm that Playmate Nikki Leigh displayed, forget acting because that was non-existent. The decision to have ""Bombshell"" host seems to be more of a monetary choice than a thematic one, otherwise we'd have Dyanne Thorne hosting.

As far as the trailers go, loved 'em. I would have liked to of seen a few other films included like RED NIGHTS OF THE GESTAPO, NIGHT PORTER, SALO and THE GESTAPO'S LAST ORGY represented but this was a pretty cool starter for people unaware of the sub-genre. NAZITHON is a decent production but nothing I plan to own.",1374278400,17,904,5.067114093959732

8594483,4,B00DMF7S32,"Going back to their roots Full Moon has put out another trailer comp. This one focuses on all the Naziploitation films from the 70s. Hosted by some tattooed skanky looking woman,looked her up and she is the one that broke up Sandra Bullock and Jesse James,we get almost 90 minutes of Naziploitation trailers and even some films that are barely related to the Naziploitation genre. So you get to see trailers for stuff like Love Camp 7,the Ilsa films and even Salon Kitty.

The trailers are ragged but not unwatchable. The host segments look good but the hostess can't do a German accent and can't even get the name of the film right. She calls it NaziAthon at least once.

But if you enjoy trailer comps and the 70s Naziploitation films this is worth getting.",1531267200,,759,4.614814814814815

8594485,3,B00DMF7S32,"Note that this is just a compilation of trailers from older movies and not a 'new' exploitation film with a new plot and characters. It was okay I guess for what it was but I was disappointed. Perhaps a more careful reading of the description should have told me that but I didn't think it was exactly obvious. If you're looking for a quick view of the history of these movies then it's okay. If you're looking for something more recent (that is, an actual movie with a plot), then this isn't it.",1513641600,,496,4.344086021505376
8594486,4,B00DMF7S32,"I love the Nazi Exploitation genre because It brings balance to a collective psyche that tends to worship atrocity as though It were a religion unto Itself. While these movies have a joyousness in their depravity laden farce there is a colonel of truth beneath the smut; World Domination is a Decadent and Sleazy pursuit.

Whether the genre turns you on or not is subjective. Those exhausted with the campaigns of Do-Gooders who take too seriously a You-are-what-you-watch attitude will find some ointment here. For people who wish to step out of the mainstream and begin to explore cult cinema this is a nice overview.

Personally I would love to own most of these movies but at times I feel ridiculous having fifteen death camp classics on my wishlist. This DVD is a nice placeholder for that wing of my collection.

As to what movies depicted are actually worth viewing there is a general trend of declining quality in the sequence of the films as they are shown. ILSA: SHE WOLF OF THE SS (1975) is, in my opinion, the high water mark of the genre.

ILSA is also the most enjoyable due to the performance and abilities of Dyanne Thorne. Dyanne Thorne steals the show from the Nazis and, with the focus on her, at no time do I mistake what I am watching for an actual feature on the politics or genocidal pursuits of several unfortunate groups of people in an evolutionary cul de sac of space and time.

Some of the other films here have merit and deserve inclusion into the film archives for no other reason than the sheer audacity that It took, especially in the earlier entries, to film and exhibit anything so blatantly counter to the moral opinion of the times. These filmmakers really give the Free Speech/Thinking Movement a little breathing room and that, if for nothing else, is reason enough to be aware of and inclusive of these films as deserving of all of the protections that we afford to art as well as the artists who create art.
