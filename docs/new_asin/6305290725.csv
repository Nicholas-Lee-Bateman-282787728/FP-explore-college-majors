7886955,3,6305290725,"There are two tapes for this piece.
The first is a history of Irish music in America.  That tape delivers as an interesting and entertaining  piece.  The music is pretty good.  The only complaint on this is the sound  quality.
The second tape is a performance of a play in Chicago... a sort  of older version of Riverdance, but nowhere near that good.  This tape  could have just been called the History of Irish Music because there is  very little dancing unfortunately.  The second tape isn't that good mostly  due to sound quality.
This tape is overall worth watching, but don't  expect Riverdance.  Good music prevails though and gives this a slight  recommendation.",966297600,8,670,4.814159292035399
