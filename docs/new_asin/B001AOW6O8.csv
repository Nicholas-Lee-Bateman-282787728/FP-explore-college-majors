8278437,3,B001AOW6O8,"I'm not too sure how to start this review, but there will be some spoilers. Okay, I consider the 3 star rating to be somewhat generous. Like another reviewer's opinion Robert Livingston leaves little to be desired as either Don Diego OR Zorro. Looking more like the villain in The Bat Whispers than Zorro this never came across to me as a true Zorro film. Don't let the cover art fool you. Zorro's face is completely covered with a black hooded mask. I would say the bullfight was probably one of the very few highlights of this little over an hour film that confused me, as it seems some of the characters seemed to forget if they were supposed to be good guys or bad guys. More of a collector's trinket for nabbing a small piece of film history that something was actually filmed in 2 strip color two years prior to the perfected 3 strip color used in The Adventures of Robin Hood. Colorwise it looks like the color episodes of George Reeves' The Adventures Of Superman. But since this is from Alpha Entertainment expect the picture to look a little washed out. Not nearly washed out as bad as their Gamera dvds, but still washed out nonetheless. Now I'm just waiting for The Mark Of Zorro 1940 to watch and review.",1310688000,,1217,4.461883408071749
8278438,3,B001AOW6O8,"Well, here's a fine how do you do, opening a Zorro adventure with the dashing hero already nabbed and about to be served up to the gallows. THE BOLD CABALLERO premiered in 1936, thus predating the Tyrone Power classic by some years. But the production values are very modest, the narrative is creaky, and the running time is at slightly over 66 minutes, making this a less than prestigious venture. But while a humble effort, THE BOLD CABALLERO still has things going for it. As a curiosity piece, this film may draw in Zorro afficianados keen to check out this outlaw's costume. This champion of the people is gigged out in a full hood, making this perhaps the only time a celluloid Zorro is faithful to the cover of the All-Story Weekly issue that debuted pulp writer Johnston McCulley's story, THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO. I confess that I prefer the half-mask. Part of the fun is in seeing Zorro flash that devilish grin.

There's also an early use of a toro-cam here, which made me smile.

In Old California, the poor pueblo of Santa Cruz has been victimized by seven years of the local Commandante's foul rule. The oppressed citizenry - most of whom are Indian natives as opposed to Mexican pens - reverently chant Zorro's name, perhaps as a prayer for salvation, perhaps as a charm against unfair taxation, or perhaps simply to infuriate the Commandante and his soldados. Somewhere, the people's protector hears their plea.

Here's this pompous new governor, come to Santa Cruz and very much displeased with all this talk of El Zorro at large. Here's Don Diega Vega, visiting from Mexico and styling himself a ""gentleman pauper."" Don Diego is rightaway regarded as a weak-kneed and fawning nobleman, his smelling salts ever at the ready. When the new governor is murdered, suspicion falls on El Zorro. The governor's lovely daughter, Isabella Palma, inherits the governor's position and vows vengeance on the masked outlaw. Heather Angel as ""Isabella"" is rather memorable and captivating and hers has got to be one of the earliest roles portraying a strong, decisive woman in power. Man, I am a sucker for a pretty face. Besides, it's just nice to see her outside of those Bulldog Drummond films.

If you're a fan of Robert Livingston's or a relative of, you may resent the following (but I hope we'll stay pals). To put it bluntly, Livingston lacks the charisma and high spirits of other Zorro actors (Fairbanks, Power, Williams, and even Banderas). He makes for a bland Don Diego and an even more innocuous Zorro. I look at him and it's a hard sell. Oh, he does some things that I appreciate. I like his banter. I like the running subplot in which he lifts a page from Cyrano de Bergerac and ""coaches"" the Commandante in wooing Isabella. But, ultimately, Livingston doesn't have the presence to pull it off. It hurts him that his swordsmanship is shoddy. Plus, during a duel, his Zorro gets the sword knocked out of his hand (what self-respecting Zorro loses his sword during a due- ugh, never mind). Still, rent this one if you get a chance because it's worth it for Heather Angel's strong performance and for the interesting bits here and there. And also if you want to see Zorro in drag. Oh, yes, he did.",1309219200,2,3212,4.720142602495543

  Shot in a 2 Color system,probably Cinecolor this looks wonderful

  The film itself is also excellent .
 Highly Recomended",1293753600,,179,4.8
8278440,5,B001AOW6O8,"I received The Bold Caballero in very condition. Both the image and the sound are fine. For a long time, I considered buying from Amazon, but without doing it, as I thought it would be troublesome for me at age 68. Finally I did, and I hope to contact you again soon. I wanted to buy this picture as well as The Vigilantes Are Coming because I remembered Bob Livingston from my childhood days at my hometown theater in Morovis, Puerto Rico. During those days, my father, who was also a teacher, was the person of projecting the pictures. Those were beautiful times, and Bob Livingston is still part of them. Thank You, Amazon!!!",1281225600,2,628,4.517543859649122
