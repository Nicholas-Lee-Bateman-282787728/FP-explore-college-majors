I bought the 3 DISC DVD SET  so I watch each episode when the mood takes me.
I have no doubt, just like me you will smile, blush & identify with the situations our actors convey = most of us would know only too well.
It was fun & enjoyable seeing the actors that I know & recognise from other movies (both gay & straight) participating in a episodes from a totally left field angle = maybe out of their usually comfort zone.
However the REAL BONUS for me was watching the Outtakes & Bloopers section that were insightful & always very funny & you get a real insight to the actors actual  character & personality.
Look if you are looking for a story, full feature movie go buy & watch THE TEN YEAR PLAN  possibly the best gay themed movie (in many years) to hit the gay scene since Shelter but if you just want to relax, sit back & be taken away from the harsh realities of life for 3 minutes at a sitting & have a chuckle Steam Room stories will do the trick.
Now if Creature/Director JC Calciano could get his Co-writer/producer Nicholas Downs to only drop his towel the ratings would take off!...just saying.",1458864000,,1415,4.304511278195489
8741421,2,B0184KO4UY,"So this is an attempt at skit type comedies, little brief 3 to 4 minute vignettes that will only succeed if the very lovely boys and they are lovely would have actually had the comedic talent to pull this off. don't get me wrong, they had nothing to work with at all so should not be held responsible. The boys are cute and have nice attractive bodies. The so-called jokes fall flat and the dialog is forced at best.",1458777600,,416,4.2784810126582276

8741423,1,B0184KO4UY,"This is the most tedious and shallow  gay  film that I have ever seen on dvd..What was the purpose of it all? I knew I was going to be in for a  very boring  time when I watched the bloopers  extra.. I have never been in a sauna like this one- everyone wears  white underpants under their towels In fact I have never been inside a sauna,even straight ones, where  the people wear towels..Have you ever seen a  person  take a gym bag into a sauna? I haven't..The same cast keep appearing and disappearing and use their mobiles. Who has ever seen  anyone use a mobile in a sauna? Strictly forbidden and they  are unlikely to work  without  being damaged. A really massive yawn of a  film. Don't waste your money. Truly the blandest  of gay  films. It was probably written by someone who has never  set foot inside a  sauna. BORING AS HELL!",1454457600,,837,4.324675324675325

8741425,5,B0184KO4UY,"This is a 248-minute comical romp of sexy guys in towels. This is a skit comedy that came off of You Tube. This series of shorts grew a huge following and still has a following today. A mix of sexiness around comical moments of DUDES expressing themselves. These have a classic sense of sketch comedy with a modern twist of shirtless heart-throbs. Geared toward the gay community but all orientations are fans of this wild, sexy, and most of all steamy reality.

This DVD puts all 99 episodes together. You can buy this as three separate Volumes or the one I am reviewing is all three Volumes in 1, which is a huge plus. This is one laugh after the other. It is one of the best web series I have ever been able to enjoy. As the web series moves forward you become attached to the players on screen. Each one has a style of their own, but each one creates a laugh out good time. I cracked up in many of the spots to the point I had to stop watching. There are moments that are just a hoot to experience.

Now just to show you how popular this series is, there has been well over 31 million watches. Well over 72 thousand subscribers to the You Tube Channel. This 3 Disc Special Edition DVD is truly an entertaining experience to watch all the episodes of this brilliant, landmark of You Tube show. Equal parts sketch comedy, with equal parts sexy manliness. Ripped bare chested sexy models in towels and undies, need I say more. Geared to both male and female viewers, this series of sketches stand out above and beyond a lot of comical flare out there.

Starring a wonderful collection of performers. Each guy owns their parts, and makes you follow along. Each one play off each others acting skills to create the comical banter.
Directed, co-written and created by J.C. Calciano. J.C. has directed 3 films which are all really a tie in with Steam Room Stories. 2010s Is It Just Me, 2011s Cupid, 2014 The 10 Year Plan. J.C. is able to capture, create, and bring forth memorable stories, and most of all entertainment. Steam Room Stories is a prime example of that talent. A fun, wild, simple, silly, comical enjoyment of true laughs, and giggles, wrap around some wonderful eye candy of hot guys in hardly anything covering their hot bods.

Audio/Video:

My Rating: 4 out of 5

This is a web-series but filmed with a spark of excellence. The audio and video are perfected. The audio is crystal clear, the video is vibrant in color and imagery.
1.78 Anamorphic Widescreen. Stereo.

Extras: 4 out of 5

You get some wonderful extras. SRS Live Online chats with the guys, hosted by stars Coco Peru and Miss Ricefield 1981.

A wonderful feature of Bloopers, which is priceless. Never aired episodes. A trailer for the Steam Room Stories and also trailers for Cinema175 movies.

3 Disc Set. containing all the first 99 episodes with the original cast. On a news worthy note, Volume 4 with episodes of 100-133. Like I said what is so good about this 3 Disc set, is its the first 3 volumes of this wild over the top series of skit perfection. A wonderful comedy series that truly knows how to induce the funny inside just about anyone. A set of hot guys, towels, and steam.

Overall:

Sexy, fun perfection. Comical sketches of giggling inducing enjoyment. What I like about it, is it is out there, edgy, sometimes blunt, or at least always blunt. Its a series of guys, who like guys. A gay comical romp of pure steamy hotness surrounded with the back drop of comical bliss. Its like Saturday Night Live, Mad TV, In Living Color all filmed in one spot, the Steam Room of a gym. Want to laugh, see sexy guys, then look no further than this priceless series of skits that demand to be watched and remembered.
