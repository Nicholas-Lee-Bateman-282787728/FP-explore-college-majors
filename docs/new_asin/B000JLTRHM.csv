2675530,3,B000JLTRHM,"The Movie has special meaning to me because of the actors in it and the link they have with Arizona Author Stella Pope Duarte.
She is good friends with most of the actors involved and several of them may also be in her Movie-that she sold her rights to from her book: Let Their Spirits Dance. I use it show my friends and family and talk about my good friend the author in the process. We all enjoy this film and I tell them all they can get a copy from Amazon. It's a Win-Win Movie.",1363478400,,483,4.041666666666667
2675531,5,B000JLTRHM,I REMEMBERING WATCHING THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.  LOVED IT THEN AND LOVE IT NOW..PLANNING A GIRLS MOVIE NIGHT OUT.  ALL OF US SISTERS WILL HAVE A BLAST,1363219200,,160,4.3
2675532,5,B000JLTRHM,"This is one of my favorite movies. Sort of like a Latina, ""Waiting to Exhale"".  I love the characters and how they explore every facet, whether it's real or a myth about the way people perceive each other.  It is funny, poignant and serious all at the same time.  And the music is fabulous, the best soundtrack ever.  This is a great rainy day movie and one that you will watch over and over again.

2675535,3,B000JLTRHM,"I neither loved nor hated this film, so I'll split the difference and give it a ""3 Star"" rating. It was televised last night on one of the local cable stations, and being a Scott Bakula fan I decided to watch - with no expectations either way. What I certainly didn't expect was the boiling over of my emotions which pretty much occurred right from the get-go. It became quite apparant that the writer has a very definite CHIP on her shoulders concerning Caucasians (although she prefers to use the more derogatory word ""white""). Being a Caucasian woman myself - and one who resides in a heavily latino-populated city (Los Angeles), my opinions will come from that particular perspective. In other words, I truly believe that Caucasian women will see this film in a very different light than will Latinas.

O.K., so as far as the stereotyping, let's begin with the one that seems to override the entire picture: Mexicans and/or Latinos in general should not date outside of their own race (i.e. this is the writer's stereotype, not mine), and in particular should not date ""Caucasians"" or ""Americans"" ... nevermind that the storyline takes place in America and not Mexico. Seems the writer prefers to divide people by race rather than nationality (i.e. not every Caucasian living in the USA is American born, nor is every Latino originally from Mexico). That said, Caucasian women are stereotyped by the Latina women in this film in a very negative manner, and are even referred to as ""loose bitches"". Caucasian men don't fair any better, as they are stereotyped as only dating Mexican women so that they can utilize their domination and/or look down on their dates, so to speak. Oh, they are also described as, to put it politely, not exactly being well-endowed (although this stereotype is put to rest in one erotic scene involving the Caucasian lawyer). That brings me to another offensive stereotype: the lawyer is not only ""Caucasian"" but ""Jewish."" One of the women though is dating a Korean man, which is also portrayed as unacceptable (although to be fair, his Korean parents seem to have a problem with this as well). Another woman has a gay brother, which is also seen as unacceptable - no wonder so many gay Latinos have to stay in the closet most if not all of their lives. FYI: there are people of all ethnicities, religions and nationalities whom are gay or lesbian. So have I covered all the stereotypes yet? In sum, the Latinas are portrayed as being everything from racist to homophobic to anti-semitic. There is, however, one bright side to all of this. Over the years there have been more than enough race-oriented movies which continually portray the ""Caucasians"" as the bad guys. The fact is that Racism and Bigotry exists in all communities, and until people from all backgrounds are willing to look inward and examine their own cultural biases, it always will.

One final point: As A Los Angeleno I can assure anyone who reads this that ""racism"" from the Latino community towards the Caucasians (or as many of them still refer to us as ""gringos"") is alive and well. It exists in the work world too. Just try finding employment in California if you don't speak Spanish. I mention this particular factor in the hope that Latinos, who have been fortunate enough to make a good living in America, will reexamine their own biases and realize that privilege is more just than skin deep! If I could speak Spanish I wouldn't have to experience so many long-term periods of unemployment. Silly me .... I thought California was part of the United States (and not Mexico).",1306713600,,3583,4.786752827140549
2675536,5,B000JLTRHM,"I loved this movie, it has a reality check along with many funny and heart warming scenes. I would recommend it to anyone. Most important to all the men it's not a chick flick. My boyfriend loved it.",1303603200,,199,4.2631578947368425
2675537,3,B000JLTRHM,"Scott Bakula guest stars as the ""white"" Jewish heart throb
in an East LA Mexican movie about women between cultures.
The idea is there are these four educated Mexican girls
who have reached near middle age in LA. Most are relatively successful in their careers,
but are having some problems in their love lives.
One is a train wreck artist who has very little luck with men
and gets drunk every time things go south on her.
One is a psychologist who hasn't yet adapted to being a professional
in a blue collar Mexican world.
One is a fashion designer who makes hip Mexican-American fashions.
The last best hero is a divorce lawyer who handles cases for abused Mexican women.
When her marriage goes on the rocks, things heat up.
This movie portrays Latino women in LA as kind of loose.
Anyone believing that is about to be disappointed?
I liked it as bad as the picture of Mexicans is in the movie
because it was kind of funny in a head bashing way.",1260576000,,948,4.454022988505747
2675538,5,B000JLTRHM,"I purchased this movie for my niece, a Robert Beltran fan, and, despite not normally liking this sort of movie, fell in love.  This movie is not just for Latinos it is for everyone. It shows how alike humans really are regardless of ethnicity, religion and, to some extent, up bringing. The special features, especially the director's commentary, are a real bonus and well worth watching.",1243814400,,388,4.878787878787879
2675539,5,B000JLTRHM,"Great chick flick, but some men would also enjoy it.  Being Hispanic, I can totally relate to the characters, but you don't have to be Hispanic to enjoy it.  I've watched it twice already and also bought one as a gift.",1238630400,,218,4.2926829268292686
2675560,5,B000JLTRHM,"I am not hispanic but i really liked this movie ,i purchased this some time back when it was released on dvd ,Great movie i like it just like i liked Waiting to Exhale",1235606400,,167,3.9411764705882355
2675561,5,B000JLTRHM,This is a great movie for all to watch!  I saw this movie years ago on a cable station and looked for it at the video stores.  It was hard to find until I found it at Amazon stores.  Perfect movie for ladies to watch on a girls get together night.,1234483200,,247,3.803921568627451
2675562,5,B000JLTRHM,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! GREAT FOR WHEN MY FRIENDS COME OVER SO WE CAN HAVE A LAUGH AND SOME TEQUILA!,1233878400,,96,3.85
2675563,5,B000JLTRHM,"I saw the movie when it premiered years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I bought several copies of the movie for gifts for girlfriends & my daughters.  The movie touches on so many issues faced by Latinas and I especially liked that the characters were portrayed as dynamic, educated women who held tight to their cultural roots.  The movie invokes laughter, is thought provoking and quite entertaining!",1231286400,,403,4.985074626865671
2675564,1,B000JLTRHM,"I would give the movie 0.5 star.  The performance was totally totally beyond bad.  They just seem that they cannot act at all period.  To call it a hispanic version of ""waiting to exhale"" is a total misnomer b.c ""waiting to exhale"" has a great content and great cast members while this one has interesting ideas but horrific 4 latina actresses to exeute the movie.  Totally waste of my time.  I would never recommend anyone to rent this movie.",1211587200,,443,4.556962025316456
2675565,4,B000JLTRHM,"This is the second copy of Luminarias I have purchased. The other was loved so much by someone I loaned it to that they kept it.
It's a wonderful story of four Latina women growing up in Los Angeles. I can only encourage you to see it for yourself. My wife and I loved it. In fact, we may watch it again this evening!",1206316800,,317,3.96875
2675566,5,B000JLTRHM,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end because not only was it funny, but there is a lesson to be learned that love can be found where you least expect it. The women were beautiful and intelligent also thumbs up to Cheech Marin.  The scenery was fantastic!",1203033600,,271,4.530612244897959

2675568,1,B000JLTRHM,"Desde el inicio de este simulacro filmico, me decepcionaron, la indisponibilidad de una pista en castellano, la superficialidad y baratez de las protagonistas y por ultimo, el final feliz para todos, cosa architipica del cine gringo pero poco frecuente entre los hispanos de verdad, quienes suelen maliciar que la verdad puede ser triste, y la felicidad pasajera. Al escuchar los comentarios de las mujeres, recien despues de empezar la proyeccion, me dije ""Ahi me veo confirmado nuevamente ese dicho de 'Mas vale solo que mal acompanado'"". Indigna de ver. He dicho.",1146441600,,566,5.230769230769231
2675569,5,B000JLTRHM,"I saw this movie last night by chance (there was nothing else on TV) and I am very glad I did.  Even though I am not Mexican American I am a hispanic woman and this movie showed a side of us that many people don't see.  First of all these women were not your stereotypical latinas we see on screen such as gang bangers, prostitutes, poor and uneducated, instead the're just the opposite but with the hangups that plague most minority women.  I know because as a latina growing up in the South during the 60's I always felt the same way. I attended private Catholic schools and it was hell, the white girls felt I was too brown so friendship was out and the black kids I came in contact with  also gave me the cold shoulder so for a long time I felt displaced.  As a result I  did everything I needed to do to have a great education and make money. But the price was high. It is only now that I'm trying to get back to my roots.
This movie also shows a lot of the problems women in general have to deal with specially those of us who are independent and of strong will.  And as for those who thought the male characters  were flat and two dimensional, they need to realize that the movie was about the women.  By the way, I thought portrayal of ""cholo"" the professor was a great depiction of how many of us judge people by the way they look instead of who they really are.",1067817600,,1371,4.12406015037594
2675580,3,B000JLTRHM,"This is an idealized but rather narrow characterization of Latinas.  The film's weakness, contrary to the other reviews, is the writing. The male characters are pat and two-dimensional. Even the ""cholo"" professor (Cheech Marin) gets re-played as the proverbial ""if only it were so"" Chicano sight gag.  The female characters, like the over/under-sexed Virgen-de-Guadalupe-devotee Irene (Angela Moya) whose persona manages to trivialize Catholic Lenten spirituality, seem shallow and undeveloped.
  Only Sofia (Marta Du Bois) and Andrea (Evelina Fernandez, incidentally also this film's writer) develop any depth. Ironically, most believable of all is Andrea's abused divorce client (played by Seidy Lopez) who is type-cast in a role all too closely mirroring her brilliant chola portrayal in Mi Vida Loca.
  Warning!: the film tackles racial-political issues from shaky ground...the 'rage' of the oppressed minority class that Andrea harbors rings ingenuous. 'White oppression!' she proclaims, from the balcony of her lawyer mansion, or from behind her executive desk safe within the high-rise realm of white power structures.  As a Latino/a one can sympathize with anti-white/male bent, but it is at times shrill and probably out of sync with the experience of upwardly mobile Latinas at large.
  This film is praise-worthy for the effort to take on so many issues at once, and is visually striking in moments, due to the art direction of noted Chicana artist Patsi Valdez.  It also takes an interesting and all too short side-track into Banda sub-culture. It is worth watching though, because the genre is so rare and endangered.  It conveys the sedate warmth of Latino family life and friendships convincingly, and does seem to typify the inter-racial scope of contemporary Chicano life in L.A.",1050969600,,1796,5.447653429602888
2675581,5,B000JLTRHM,"This movie has so much to offer. I have seen this many times and i enjoy it each and every time. This movie really shows how Latinas in the real aspects of reality. This has a powerful message saying that women of color (latinas) are worth gold and that no matter what we can make it. The friendships in this movie is great, dysfunctional but great.  It really shows how interracial relationships effect others and how good it is at the end. To not try something new and different doesnt' always mean that it's a bad thing! Que sige la movida de peliculas como esta!",1050019200,,566,4.390476190476191
2675582,4,B000JLTRHM,"I watched this movie last night was really touched by it.  It spoke to the heart of what Mexican Americans face on a daily basis.  The complexity of the story lines were very realistic to me.  As a minority in this country I could identify with some of the struggles that these women faced. Its just a fact of life. On certain levels there are no easy solutions.  Certain aspects of these women showed them as being ""flawed"" in some way, but I appreciated how they helped each other through some of the ""madness"". We all have issues that plague us, but it matters how we allow them to help us grow.  Either we embrace them or let them hinder how we relate to others.  Even in the face of assumptions about ""other"" races (or lifestyle chosen) that were made, there were moments when the main characters had to re-examine how they previously felt.  I would say that they were enlightened, maybe not completely changed..but more aware.  This film really could have been played out within any racial group in some way all of us have had to think about these things. I also enjoyed how it examined how females and males relate to one another as well.",1048809600,,1145,4.471153846153846
2675583,5,B000JLTRHM,"I am a white male, and was not offended one bit.  This movie is not racist, but a very accurate sescription of what Mexican women are like.  I am friends with many Mexican ladies, and by God, put them together, and You have Luminarias.  This movie is funny, touching, and very true to life.  All the actors are great.  Scott Bakula, Cheech Marin play their roles to perfection.  The real stars are the ladies.  Hats off toa wonderful movie.  Everyone should see this movie.",1047686400,,473,4.5476190476190474
2675584,4,B000JLTRHM,"Great characterizations of Latinas in today modern world of high pressure jobs and high demanding relationships.  The feature combines them both along with the longstanding inner struggle with Latina indentity and male machismo.  It hit the nail on the head.  Admirable script and characters not to mention the quality of actors.
Great job guys.",1032739200,,345,5.351851851851852
2675585,5,B000JLTRHM,"I absolutely loved the writing and the performances in this movie. Not a stereotype to be found anywhere. Evelina Fernandez' writing is flawless and so is the casting. Above all, I've never seen a better representation of Latina women on film. Did I mention the writing? Evelina Fernandez knows how to set up a situation like a fast ball pitcher who suddenly throws you a breaking curve. I won't give anything away but Cheech Marin and Sal Lopez are great in secondary roles that are gems and Robert Beltran and a surprising Scott Bakula are supurb as the lead male characters. But I couldn't take my eyes off Evelina when she's on screen. Lovely and disarmingly seductive, I had no idea she was the writer until the credits rolled. She's supported by a great cast of female actors including Marta DuBois, Dyana Ortelli, Lupe Ontiveros and Angela Moya who shine. This is the kind of film you'll love showing to someone for the first time.",1030060800,,938,4.6909090909090905
2675586,5,B000JLTRHM,"This film is fun and joyous as it explores relationships in the context of ethnicity and identity.  Latin life in L.A. is embraced and beautifully depicted.  The pace is quick and light, even though it is touching on some very tough issues and allows each of the central characters to grow in unexpected ways.  My teenage daughters and I saw the film when it was first released at the theaters and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We have been anxiously awaiting its release to DVD, and we have enjoyed it even more the second time around.  The film deserved much more attention at the box office.  Maybe it will find a larger audience now.  We highly recommend this movie.",1021766400,,667,4.601694915254237
2675587,5,B000JLTRHM,Seldom have I seen a movie that was a sleeper where I had to patiently wait as long as I did for it to be out on DVD! I'm glad it is finally out I worried that it would never be out!  I have been looking for Luminarias since shortly after I viewed it at one of the very few local theatres that featured this wonderful movie.  I viewed it with a fellow latina who also loved it.  No explanation can do it justice it is just a wonderful portrayal of the latino operational & biological family dynamic!  It encompasses the beauty and shortcomings in our culture group as well as the many facets surrounding many of our interpersonal relationships. The movie's flavoring with just the right Spanish language words made it unique and no one will be able to duplicate this movie. Not to take away from Waiting to Exhale but I disagree that it was a latino version of Waiting to Exhale... it can stand on its own merits it doesn't need and should not be compared. Latina women will likely be able to appreciate it a bit more due to many of its unique cultural aspects.,1015027200,,1061,4.316582914572864
2675588,5,B000JLTRHM,"Evelina Fernandez's writing is superb, she takes you on a thrilling emotional rollercoaster ride.  Through the slump of a divorce and the exciting high of dating a new love, and everthing in between.  The film brought back fond memories of growing up Latino, I felt like I had just revisited my old friends and familia.  The characters portray the complete Latino spectrum; from the savvy vato performed masterfully by Cheech Marin to the wanna be gabacha played by the wonderful Marta DuBois.  Dyana Ortelli, Angela Moya and Lupe Ontiveros are hilarious and turn in outstanding performances.  When you're not crying you'll be laughing uncontrollably.  Robert Beltran is very believable as the scoundrel husband.  Sal Lopez is a convincing Mexican mesero who is tenacious in his pursuit of DuBois' character.  Truly one of the few well put together and  enjoyable films in a long time.  Latinas will have to get together for a ""Luminarias"" slumber party and talk about men until the wee hours of the morning.  I'm looking forward to more movies from this group of top-notch performers.",1014163200,,1085,5.03932584269663
