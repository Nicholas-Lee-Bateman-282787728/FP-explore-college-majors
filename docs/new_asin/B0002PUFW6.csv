2113615,1,B0002PUFW6,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this DVD set, and was very disappointed when I finally bought and watched it.  This set gives us syndicated versions of ""Make Room For Daddy"" episodes which are VERY heavily edited!  Many times the edits are abrupt fade out/fade ins, and the missing portions of the episodes make some of the stories difficult or confusing to follow.  Putting edited syndicated versions of these ""Make Room For Daddy"" episodes on DVD is unforgivable and certainly not worth the money for this DVD set!",1098576000,74,524,4.865168539325842
2113616,5,B0002PUFW6,"As a baby boomer, I remember racing home to watch the reruns of the television classic ""Make Room for Daddy"" (1957-1962).  I enjoyed watching the antics of Rusty and little Linda.  In fact, I recall the ""Mr. Jumbo"", as well as ""Tomboy Linda"" episodes with fondness. Hopefully, the entire run from the Danny Thomas series (1957-1964) shall become available on DVD. Indeed, the show is a tribute to classic television.",1098403200,5,416,4.928571428571429
2113617,1,B0002PUFW6,"I anxiously awaited the release of this set. How disappointing to find that, like Questar's release of ""The Joey Bishop Show"", this set truncates the opening credits from each episode. Sorry, Questar....the shows should be in their entirety.

Fortunately, I read of this atrocity before purchasing this set. Until I find out that Questar has changed its ways, they will be added to my list of companies from which to NEVER buy.",1098403200,16,427,4.930555555555555
2113618,5,B0002PUFW6,"This show ran for 11 years and has not been seen on television in many years. I was delighted to hear they were releasing some of the episodes of ""Make Room for Daddy"" and the 57-58 season is a representive sample of the series. The DVD is packaged very well and for the full season plus the episode introducing Andy Griffith,the set is priced very reasonably. Danny Thomas has always been one of my favorites and the cast of the show worked very well with him. Compared to other family sitcoms of the era ""Leave it to Beaver:.""Donna Reed"" and ""Father Knows Best"". the Danny Williams character was real and much more in tune with the way families act. The relationship with Danny and his son Rusty was great..sentimental and gruff at the same time. Of course for all the ""realism"" in the show,itwas always a kick when Danny would start to sing while playing the piano and miraculously, a full orchestra would emerge! After watching a few of these episodes I remembered how warm and funny they were and its good to have them on DVD""Make room for Danny"" in your DVD collection. It's a nice addition.",1096934400,3,1097,4.545454545454546
2113619,3,B0002PUFW6,"Oh, how i have waited for this day! I am a long time fan of this of almost forgotten classic. i still to this day do not know why this show has never aired on nick at night. it is (in my opionion) funnier than the Dick Van Dyke show. (i,m not knocking the dyke, i like him alot)

 I don't know if some younger people realize how much danny thomas had to do with the production of so many other great tv shows. he truly was a mogul of his era. Anyway, danny thomas / make room for daddy ran for a wopping 11 seasons. and there were lots of eppisodes in those seasons. something between 33 and 35.

 I own 14 eppisodes of ""make room for daddy"" on 16mm film (along with other stuff) that i show to friends on a 20' wide screen in the back yard. it's alot of fun.

 It's not just the laughs that make this show so great. danny was such a great roll model. and though he always pretended to have this stern, take no guff attitude on some shows, by the end of each episode, he was always the loving father who brought everything and everyone back together. and the music...so many great songs. danny was the best. god bless him.

  please let them release more of these wonderful classics and make room for danny in your heart and home.",1095120000,7,1230,4.112970711297071

2113664,3,B0002PUFW6,"I hope anyone ordering this product will see this review, or the few others commenting on this issue.  As of this writing, the most helpful review posted here states that this DVD contains 10 shows.  It does NOT.  This is no fault of the reviewer, who was writing about a different product which is apparently no longer listed at all.

This DVD actually contains three episodes only.  The editorial review provided by amazon is correct, but the customer reviews are totally misleading (again, through no fault of the customers).  These are the shows actually included:

1. A Trip To Wisconsin
2. The Ballplayers
3. The Children's Governess

This all stems, I believe, from amazon's roots as a book retailer.  It made a lot of sense, for e.g., to combine customer reviews of hard cover editions with paperbacks of the same book.  But with other products, like DVDs, it makes no sense at all, and despite the confusion it so often causes, it doesn't seem like this policy will ever be changed.",1332892800,5,991,4.742690058479532
2113665,3,B0002PUFW6,"'Make Room For Daddy' or 'The Danny Thomas Show' is an important TV show that somewhat filled the gap between 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Dick Van Dyke Show'. It is easily one of the most significant sitcoms from the early days of television and yet we are treated here to one of the most bizarre releases. First off, out of nowhere, we start with season 5? I realize that some of the early episodes have fallen into public domain, but it is still a bit off putting.

There is some good news here and some bad news, first the good news, the set can be found for under $10.00 now and the makers of this set were nice enough to include the last episode of season four to get newcomers up to speed with the new version of this sitcom. In the first three seasons Danny had a wife, but the actress Jean Hagen didn't get along with Mr. Thomas(or so I have read)and quit the show. Thomas didn't think the show would work without her, but they decided to add a new actress Marjoie Lord as a nurse maid Kathy O'Hara to the kids and have the wife die(off camera)to write her out of the show. At the end of season four she(Kathy)proposes to a shy Danny and the new stage is set for season 5. The other piece of good news is that they included the episode in which The Andy Griffith Show was created from as a bonus along with 2 other bonuses, Martin & Lewis Telethon appearance by Danny Thomas and a short tribute to Danny founding the St. Jude Children's Hospital.

The episodes run around 22-23 minutes and look OK( the season 4 finale looks the best by far), but could certainly look better. More than the soft picture is that fact they are edited or they would run  around 3-4 minutes longer. Part of the reason for episodes being shorter is that the opening theme is seen only once at the beginning of each disc and then the episodes start out in the first scene. This could account for at least 30 seconds of the episodes length, so the edits are probably minimal but still irritating. I do rememeber this show, but not well enough to know what is missing, some scenes are obvious and others aren't.

The extras are a little light and the menu screens are the only place the episode titles are present. Overall, I recommend you buy this set, but prepare to be disappointed a little. This show deserves a lot better than this and from what I've read the new company that released season 6 made major improvements. I'm just getting ready to start that season and I will review my findings when I'm finished.",1305590400,2,2495,4.336188436830835
2113666,5,B0002PUFW6,"I purchased this item to get the pilot show for the ""Andy Griffith Show"" which was a spin off of Danny Thomas's productions. Afer watching the pilot show I watched the rest of the DVD and was hooked on the clean fun. If you

So after researching the product details of all the Make Room For Daddy sample sets available, comparing content and prices against double-dip factor, I decided on this Make Room For Daddy 10-episode collection from St. Clair Vision. Don't let the studio's blunder with the artwork (Kathy & Linda aren't featured on the set) and print errors (listing ""The Sea Captain"" episode as ""Danny's Birthday"") disuade you. Once you pop the disc in and start watching these 10 complete classic episodes (from the Jean Hagen/Danny the widower years) with original commercials included none of that will matter. The episodes have been carefully re-mastered for best possible picture quality and remain just as hilarious as ever. Out of these 10 episodes, only 3 or 4 eps are also featured on the other sample sets. However, none of these eps are featured on the available season sets. For the most substantial collection of episodes from the show's earlier seasons, this Make Room For Daddy 10-episode collection is definitely the best buy!",1263600000,4,1483,6.169082125603865
2113689,5,B0002PUFW6,"Loved, loved, loved Season 5 of the ""Make Room for Daddy"" series.  I think it's the best of the entire run of the show.  Marjorie Lord was an elegant edition to the show, and these episodes showing Danny's romance/marriage/honeymoon with a second wife brought a great spark to the series.  (How smart of the producers to have Danny find a second wife, rather than just recast the role of ""Margaret"".)  All of a sudden, Danny Thomas became a romantic lead, in addition to father/husband/singe/comedian.  The older kids are still adorable, and Angela Cartwright is a great addition to the family.
I am very hopeful that Questar will release the remaining seasons.",1255219200,,661,4.918918918918919

2113692,4,B0002PUFW6,"First, the good news.  This DVD contains ten episodes from the rarely seen first four seasons of the show (two from Season One, three from Season Two, three from Season Three, and two from Season Four).  Better yet, most of the episodes are complete and uncut, including the original opening and closing credits, and all original commercials and promos.  For fans of the show, this alone makes this a DVD worth owning.

The actual episodes contained are:

Episode 8:  ""The Sea Captain"" 11/17/1953
Episode 49:  ""The Children's Governess"" 2/1/1955
Episode 7:  ""The Visiting Englishman"" 11/10/1953
Episode 82:  ""Who Can Figure Kids?""  2/21/1956
Episode 99:  ""The Talented Kid""  11/26/1956
Episode 67:  ""Danny's Palladium Offer""  10/25/1955
Episode 41:  ""Margaret Feels Neglected"" 12/7/1954
Episode 106:  ""Danny's Date""  1/14/1957
Episode 86:  ""Don't Yell At Your Children"" 3/20/1956
Episode 52:  ""Rusty's Haircut""  2/22/1955

Extra:  Radio excerpt from ""The Bickersons"" featuring Danny Thomas.

All the episodes are complete, except for Episode 82, which is a shortened (23 minute) syndicated version (with syndication opening and closing credits), and Episode 8, which is missing the closing credits only.

These episodes include some rare gems, such as a rare glimpse of the Williams' seldom seen dog Laddie (Episode 8), Danny's date with a pre-""Leave It to Beaver"" Barbara Billingsley (Episode 106), and early 1950's cigarette and automobile commercials.

Now, for the bad news.  With regard to the discrepancy between the label and the contents pointed out by other reviewers, the only difference is that the ""Sea Captain"" episode is mistakenly identified as the ""Danny's Birthday"" episode (which would be Episode 90).  Both episodes have a birthday theme, but the one on the DVD is actually Episode 8.

The larger discrepancy is due to the picture on the Amazon.com page, which differs from the actual label, showing titles for four episodes not on this DVD at all.  (Perhaps we can hope that this artwork was for another 10 episode DVD that St. Clair has yet to release!)  So the list in this review is correct; the picture is not.

Other problems with the St. Clair release are:
1. Incorrect artwork.  The pictures on the case and DVD label are of Danny's ""second family"" (with Marjorie Lord and Angela Cartwright), while all the episodes are from the Jean Hagen years (seasons 1-3) or Danny's one year as a widower (season 4).
2. Totally unrelated music in the ""episode"" menus.  I don't know where they got this music, but I don't think it has anything to do with the show.
3. Notation errors.  The mislabeling of the ""Sea Captain"" episode; a description on the package mentioning Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose (who doesn't appear in any of these episodes); misspelling of ""Palladium"" on the episode menu; the apparently random order of the episodes; etc.
4. Compression quality.  The source material looks clean, but putting 10 episodes on one DVD means they are significantly compressed - still quite acceptable, but starting to show some noticeable mpeg artifacts.

While I find these issues annoying, it is much more important to me that St. Clair apparently put some effort into using, wherever available, complete and uncut source material, rather than the truncated ""syndicated"" versions (which is all you get in Questar's awful ""Season Five"" set).  So taking off one star for the ""packaging"" issues mentioned above, I still give this release a four star rating just for making these rarely seen episodes available in their original form at such a reasonable price.",1202515200,28,3577,5.136915077989602
2113693,5,B0002PUFW6,"I totally disagree with the one review that existed of this product. All of the titles on the dvd case were correct, except for one.

So I returned it to Amazon with an explanation that they sent me the wrong DVD.  So they sent me a replacement copy, which also had the same wrong episodes.  I returned it again and was told that they were unable to replace it again.  They sent me a refund instead.

2113695,5,B0002PUFW6,"Hey Folks! It seems like many people are finding BIG PROBLEMS with this DVD collecton. DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THEM! This DVD set is in NO WAY the disappointment that others here have described. They do not know what they are talking about.

Big deal that this collection comes from the syndicated version of the show. The fact is, this show ran in syndication as early as the 60's, long before the commercials were running longer than the show. When you watch these great episodes, occasionally a scene will fade sooner than the original airing to skip past a few seconds of music that came before a commercial break. But when the scene comes back, it is obvious that you are at the same spot in the story and have not missed ANY of the dialogue.

Throughout these episodes in this DVD set, the continuity is all there, all of the lines are there and NOTHING of any importance has been cut out... only a few seconds of music here and there which used to be the longer fades to commercials. For the veiwers convenience, for those who want to watch a Danny Thomas marathion, the theme song is heard only at the beginning of each cd and NOT before every episode.

The picture and sound quality are EXCELLENT and only VERY rarely does a scene miss a split second of sound or part of a word due to a splice in the source material.

DO NOT FEAR when ordering this fantastic collection. For those of you who used to watch this series as a child, tears will come to your eyes during the first episode as you rejoin this wonderful tv family after having been away from them so long... the joy, the tempers, the music, the clowning, the mischief. I had forgotten just how much I loved these characters as well as the actors and actresses who had protrayed them! And the writers are the best! These shows are genuinely funny, promote good morals and sound family values unlike the pure GARBAGE sit com's that air today in prime time, whose writers are as morally bankrupt as the trash they write.

Unless you are a purist fanatic who must hear the last stroke of a violin bow in filler music before the commercial breaks... and unless you desperately fear the picture fading to black once in a great while to end a scene which comes back right where it left off... YOU WILL LOVE this DVD collection! Six DVD's with 6 episodes each, plus great bonus material!

I bought this from a seller here at Amazon for $9.99 plus a few bucks for shipping. If that kind of bargain is not good enough for some cry babies here, that is THEIR problem. Just make sure that they do not keep YOU from enjoying this FANTASTIC DVD collection of this wonderful show!!",1183507200,12,2634,4.443064182194617

2113707,3,B0002PUFW6,"After looking at other reviews, I didn't realize the episodes are edited.  I feel kind of cheated!  But then again I must've only seen them edited in syndication back in the '80's & early '90's.  This was the most popular version & cast lineup & popular of the entire 11 season run & of the final 7 seasons when moved to CBS. (Why did Sherry Jackson have to quit after season 5 or why was Terry written out & why couldn't Miss Jackson come back for Terry's wedding in season 7 instead of unknown Penny Parker thus not being able to show flashback's when Terry was younger.  Was Miss Parker's Terry older than Miss Jackson's or did Terry get courted & married at age 18?)  It's great to see again after an abscence of 13-14 years after Nick at Nite discontinued showing after Mr. Thomas passed away spring '91.  By the way Nick at Nite from what I remember only showed seasons 5-8.  I had never seen an episode beyond that until summer '90 when an independent station where I was living at the time continued to season 9 (Angela Cartwright starts to look more & more like Brigita Von Trapp & Penny Robinson instead of 5yo Linda Williams & Rusty Hamer's Rusty Williams has gone through puberty & his voice has changed).  I didn't know that the Williams moved into two more apartments or condos & the sets were different for seasons 8 & 9. But partway into season 9 Nick at Nite must've discovered someone else was broadcasting on free antenna tv & bought out all syndicated rights because that channel stopped showing.  I had never seen the first version or ABC version until I bought the inexpensive samplers of the first 3 seasons.  I always thought of oldest child Terry as a teen & figured from pictures of season 1 that she must've been a younger girl at one time & Rusty Hamer was predessor of Angela Cartwright as the youngest cutest one who gets all the attention.  I can see why season 5 was the first to be available to the public because that's also the first season of the CBS years & cast lineup that most people of my generation who grew up watching reruns in the '70's & '80's are familiar with.  I didn't know there was an earlier version until about '87 or '88 when I checked out a tv trivia book at a local library & that's when I wondered why is Linda older than Rusty & Rusty so young?  Even if each is edited, when are the first four seasons, in a different apartment & set w/Terry & Rusty's birth mother, going to be released? How about also rereleasing season 5 unedited?  I'll gladly pay another $50 & sell the edited set even though I'll probably only get $5 for it.  Can season 6 at least be released sometime soon & the remaining Marjorie Lord seasons annually afterwards even if edited? You know I wonder if the first 3 seasons were never shown in syndication or on Nick at Nite or not available because the samplers include original footage of tobacco companies presenting & sponsoring in the first season opening credits?

But anyway, I suppose it's recommended if you love this show, even if it's only the first version, or it's your first time & dying to see, to purchase this set.  It's better than nothing & it wouldn't suprise me Questar & Mr. Thomas' surviving family decide to soon remove from the market & consider this entire series out-of-print & secured in a vault permanently.  By the way, if you love the cast besides ""Sound of Music"" & ""Lost in Space"" I also recommend the following:  ""Singin' in the Rain"" (& I thought that was actually the way Miss Hagen talked until I saw a first version episode for the first time) ""I'll See You in my Dreams"" ""The Jazz Singer"" (original '40's version if not out of print, not the retarded '80 remake) "" ""Batman ('66-'68) season 1"" and ""Charlie's Angels season 4"" (when these are released)  One last thought:  what about releasing two followup reunions?  '67's pilot ""Make More Room for Daddy"" & the short-lived ""Make Room for Grandaddy"" ('70-'71 w/original CBS cast including Sherry Jackson)",1146700800,9,3972,4.502785515320334

2113710,1,B0002PUFW6,"I want to see the very first season of the show! I'm talking about when Jean Hagan was Danny's wife and the kid's Sherry Jackson and Rusty Hammer were much younger. In my mind, the earlier years with Sherry Jackson and Rusty Hammer being so very young and Jean Hagan as his wife were much funnier than those with Marjorier Lord and Angela Cartright. Even though season five is already out, there's no trason why they can't go back to season one and progress from there. Releasing season five was a mistake now, however, the problem can be easily corrected.",1116288000,9,556,4.57

2113712,1,B0002PUFW6,"I, like another reviewer, have not purchased this set. I feel that it's pointless to do so if the versions are syndicated. I think this is a deplorable (wreched) practice. This was a fantastic show and deserves far better than that!!! I certainly hope that this doesn't become a trend, although I fear that it will if they see people will buy them. I'll have to keep watching my already hacked for commercial's sake versions that I taped from Nick at Nite back in '88 and '89. (Yes Jimmy B., Nick at Nite DID run them)",1103500800,20,518,4.40625
2113713,1,B0002PUFW6,"First, let me say that I have not seen this DVD, so my remarks are basically about WHY from the available information.

I was a BIG fan of this show many years ago, and I agree with the other reviewers that it desperately deserves DVD treatment.  But GET REAL, people.  If the episodes are not complete -- INCLUDING the commercials that at that time were as much part of the plot as the rest of the action -- then to buy the collection would send TOTALLY the wrong message to the disk's producers.  RESPECT THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR CUSTOMERS.  Don't dangle a carrot for us and then hit us with this kind of brick.  That's almost as bad as redubbing the music on WKRP in Cincinnati.  Oh.  Sorry.  They did that too

I anxiously await a time when I can get the full episodes.",1102982400,19,791,4.319727891156463
2113714,2,B0002PUFW6,"I love the Make room for Daddy show and I am glad that at least one DVD is available for the series.  However, Questar did a horrible job of creating the DVD.  There are NO chapters on the disc and therefore, if you have a multi-disc player, you cannot mark the spot on the disc to return to later.  There is not even a ""Top"" menu.

Like other reviewers, I noted that parts of the shows were cut (it is very obvious).  When all is said and done though, it was Great seeing this old show again.  To bad the producers of the video did such a poor job!",1102291200,24,549,3.9908256880733943
2113715,2,B0002PUFW6,"Well - as other reviewers here have pointed out, there are serious problems with this release.

""Make Room for Daddy"" was an important and popular television series.  It was THE Desilu product that inherited the coveted Monday night at 9 p.m. slot vacated by ""I Love Lucy"" when it switched to an hour-long/once a month format starting in the fall of 1957.

Danny Thomas starring as Danny Williams moved from ABC with his two children Terry (Sherry Jackson) and Rusty (Rusty Hamer). He had been raising them since the death of his wife (played in earlier seasons by Jean Hagen).  Along with the kids, Danny brought a new wife Kathryn Daley O'Hara Williams (Marjorie Lord) and her daughter Linda (Angela Cartwright).

This is the complete 5th season.  There is also the final episode of the 4th season - where Danny proposes to Kathy.  And as an extra, the 1960 episode that served as a sort of pilot for what became ""The Andy Griffith Show.""

All of the humor and love among the characters that you might fondly remember is here.  Danny sings some terrific songs, and there are some great guest stars.  Jackson, Hamer, and Cartwright each have moments to shine and take advantage of them.  Lord is one of the most lovely TV ""moms"" of the 1950's. Her clothes by Emeson's of Studio City are au courant for the time.  Also featured in many episodes is Amanda Randolph as Louise, the maid.

Danny does some great spit takes - he was the master.  And there is the familiar gesture he made: a quickly upturned palm with a grunt that Hamer can imitate to perfection.

There is no list of the episodes except on the disks themselves, but they seem to be in chronological order.  The transfer is very soft and there doesn't seem to have been a lot of digital enhancement on them.  Certainly for the SRP for the 34 + 2 episodes, they might have spent some time on them.

The original opening credits are shown at the beginning of each disk but NOT at the beginning of each episode.  When you choose an episode, it begins with the first scene.  The ending credits are complete.  And each episode runs about 23 minutes.  This means we are getting the syndicated versions of the episodes.  Chunks of dialog are missing.  And it's not even cleverly done as it was with ""I Love Lucy.""  Many times there is a fade out and fade in the MIDDLE of a scene.  You can tell a fade to commercial because these are usually accompanied by a musical tag.

Disgraceful that this pioneering series - sort of a bridge between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" - has been given such a short shrift.

It is wonderful to have it.  I am glad it has been released.  But if the subsequent seasons are going to be released - let's let Questar know that we won't accept such a cheat!

If you are a fan of the show - buy this set.  It will be fun to watch.  But it will leave you unsatisfied, and might even make those seeing it for the first time wonder why we thought it was so great!",1099526400,113,2955,4.402957486136784
2113716,4,B0002PUFW6,"I love classic TV Shows and I knew a little about Danny Thomas and how funny he was. I don't recall that I had ever seen anything other than clips of Make Room for Daddy but I decided to take a chance when I saw the DVD release for Season 5.  I loved it.  Danny Thomas is so funny and likeable.  The actors who played the children were all excellent - especially Rusty!  The kids were funny without being annoying as so many kids are on todays shows.  The show was very well written.  There were famous guest stars, but Danny Thomas was the star and if you haven't seen much of Danny Thomas, please check out this DVD. If you like classic comedy you won't be sorry for buying Make Room for Daddy.",1099094400,8,696,4.156716417910448

8030447,3,B0002PUFW6,"'Make Room For Daddy' or 'The Danny Thomas Show' is an important TV show that somewhat filled the gap between 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Dick Van Dyke Show'. It is easily one of the most significant sitcoms from the early days of television and yet we are treated here to one of the most bizarre releases. First off, out of nowhere, we start with season 5? I realize that some of the early episodes have fallen into public domain, but it is still a bit off putting.

There is some good news here and some bad news, first the good news, the set can be found for under $10.00 now and the makers of this set were nice enough to include the last episode of season four to get newcomers up to speed with the new version of this sitcom. In the first three seasons Danny had a wife, but the actress Jean Hagen didn't get along with Mr. Thomas(or so I have read)and quit the show. Thomas didn't think the show would work without her, but they decided to add a new actress Marjoie Lord as a nurse maid Kathy O'Hara to the kids and have the wife die(off camera)to write her out of the show. At the end of season four she(Kathy)proposes to a shy Danny and the new stage is set for season 5. The other piece of good news is that they included the episode in which The Andy Griffith Show was created from as a bonus along with 2 other bonuses, Martin & Lewis Telethon appearance by Danny Thomas and a short tribute to Danny founding the St. Jude Children's Hospital.

The episodes run around 22-23 minutes and look OK( the season 4 finale looks the best by far), but could certainly look better. More than the soft picture is that fact they are edited or they would run around 3-4 minutes longer. Part of the reason for episodes being shorter is that the opening theme is seen only once at the beginning of each disc and then the episodes start out in the first scene. This could account for at least 30 seconds of the episodes length, so the edits are probably minimal but still irritating. I do rememeber this show, but not well enough to know what is missing, some scenes are obvious and others aren't.

The extras are a little light and the menu screens are the only place the episode titles are present. Overall, I recommend you buy this set, but prepare to be disappointed a little. This show deserves a lot better than this and from what I've read the new company that released season 6 made major improvements. I'm just getting ready to start that season and I will review my findings when I'm finished.",1399593600,,2494,4.336188436830835
