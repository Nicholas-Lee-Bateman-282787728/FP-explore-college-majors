2699671,5,B000KZRP1M,"Good for any level, whether rank beginner or advanced, you'll  get something out of this Chakra Dance DVD. The relaxation it produces is marvelous, and depending where your tension accumulates, and your physical strengths and weaknesses, you will have your favorite sections you'll go back to again and again.  The exercises are extremely easy, and the benefits great.

Because I carry most of my tension in the neck and shoulders area, the initial Breath/Spine section does wonders for me. Other favorite sections are Throat, which is amazingly relaxing, and Heart, which teaches breathing through the heart center. Though I realize ""Breathing through your heart"" is largely a thinking process, it becomes a very real feeling, and is a meditation I have done for years, with tremendous results.

As Darshan and Mariyah guide you through the chakras, it starts at Root, then Sacral, Solar Plexus (with rib cage isolations/undulations), Heart, Throat, 3rd Eye (this includes a balance exercise), and Crown, with a final Grounding. The program ends with a 10 Minute Flow, where you do each movement as one continual piece without verbal instruction, which makes one feel renewed and refreshed. This DVD is a mind/spirit/body experience well worth trying.",1233532800,4,1252,5.276381909547739
2699672,4,B000KZRP1M,"I have had the DVD for awhile now and have had it in my saved items for even longer.

I did have some issues w/ it skipping and freezing all over the place w/ the last 10 mins - which is frustrating and gets you out of your newly created Zen state.

The first time I did it I had to pull my hands further apart for the heart chakra, I've never felt such intense heat. I'm a Reiki Level 1 practitioner and I've been told that the recipient felt intense heat, but I've never felt it so much when working on myself.",1208131200,3,512,3.9611650485436893
2699673,3,B000KZRP1M,This DVD was not as good as i hoped it would be. The ladies are nice but it seemed to more of Belly dancing pilates DVD than a flowing Chakra Dance or moving meditation. The explanation of each Chakra was basic and the moves did not seem to match what thet were trying to create. I was hoping for a nice moving meditation with flow and feeling not an energising work out.,1202688000,7,371,4.166666666666667
2699674,5,B000KZRP1M,"I purchased this DVD on a whim.  I have bellydanced quite a wee while now, too many years to add up! And I have also purchased too many Bellydance and exercise DVDs to add up.  Recently I had abdominal surgery and was trying to get back to my normal (rather hectic) routine of bellydance, pottery, horse riding and exercise.  I found myself losing my balance, getting distracted, oddly weepy, tired and generally not feeling my normal self.  Well this DVD addressed many issues that I had been ignoring.  The exercises on this DVD encouraged me to center myself, calm down and re-connect with earth.  I now really rely on this video, it is a dance workout which addresses more then warm strong muscles and a raised heart beat.  The Chakra Dance Flow allowed me to stop running madly and instead to stand strong, with acceptance.  I practice the longer dance flow at least twice a week and its positive effects for me are huge.  Now I am purchasing it as a gift for a close friend and recommending it to all my friends.
Thankyou Darshan and Mariyah.",1196467200,20,1048,4.561497326203209
2699675,3,B000KZRP1M,"I was a little disappointed as I felt the explanation part of the DVD went way too slow and long to keep my interest, and by the time it got to the point of just doing the whole routine with no explanation interruption, it only took about 10 minutes and it was over.  I was hoping for a little more fun and excitment, I was a little bored.  I'll probably pass it on to someone like my mom, who would probably get some fun out of it.  Also, it was difficult to determine what chakra we were working on at any given time.",1187395200,4,519,4.019417475728155

Mariyah - EasternDancer com  degree in religious studies & studio art, yoga teacher, studied middle east
It's set on a stage with Darshan & Mariyah. Good camera angles, stays far back mostly which is good, good sound, nice fade in/outs. The music is awesome, very light/soothing for the slow parts & very tribal/ethnic, great fast drum beats on others. The energy of the DVD hit me immediately, very soothing yet energizing (could be them or the music or both). Darshan & Mariyah are very patient, sweet, calm but give off a relaxed/fun energy as well.
Welcome & Energize the space & Energize the breath - 6 min - which is a quick intro, the 2 playing zills beautifully w/dancing & moving in circles around for 2 min & teaching deeper breathing w/slowly modified kundalini torso stretching.
Root - 17 min - simple stretches, posture teaching, horse stance/squat, simple tribal dance moves, African moves, shimmies, shimmies w/steps, lunges w/simple dance step/stretch, standing fwd bends, fun, slow teaching & easy, some steps are done fast tempo, you're feel stretched out a little, invigorated, your legs/butt toned a little, but you won't sweat.
Sacral - 15 min - More bellydance oriented, figure 8 infinities, upwards, downwards, outward, inward, hip circles, bicycle, hip drops, undulations, camels, combining into a tiny 4-5 move routine
Solar Plexus - 11 min - dragon breath (fluttering breath/stomach), chest circles & slides, upper body undulations, flamenco stamping/hands, flamenco quick 3 step, put that into a 4 move repeated tiny routine
Heart - 8 min -  info about posture/emotions, arm movements to give compassion for others & yourself, chi/qi ball hands to feel your own energy & opening heart energy to give compassion beyond w/stretched arms & slight arched back
Throat - 5 min - about posture/voice/listening says about your life, relaxing body, w/vocal exhale dropping forward into standing fwd bend & inhaling up, using similar qi/chi kung movement, puling energy from the ground to throat & w/wrist circles tracing a circle around body
Third Eye - 7 min - mirror dancing w/someone, not being ashamed to stare at another's eyes & staring at hers for a full minute (great exercise for shy people), eye muscle exercises, balancing on 1 foot w/mudra touching 3rd eye, balancing on 1 leg at a time w/looking at 3rd eye w/eyes closed (great exercise to increase balance & body awareness)
Crown - 6 min - simulation/affirmations of taking water over your head of the ocean/knowledge, eyes covered w/chest drops for surrender, deep neck circles that really whip hair around (I am usually careful & can't do them but here I could since as they said I went with the energy instead of worrying about perfection), twirling around in a circle about 30x each way slowly, grounding by toucing the floor & child's pose
Chakra Dance Flow - 10 min - first 90 seconds is them using the zills & dancing to energize the space, then they go through all the movements of the entire workout 1-4x each for about 9 min w/no talking, just soft, soothing music w/good beat. This part I didn't feel the energy as much

I love this video so much... I felt immediately more relaxed, more centered, grounded, focused, more creative... as good or better then some qi gong/ chi kung videos. When they spoke only or went slower then I wanted, I felt more creative to do other dancing or stretching & felt more aware & at peace with my body. I think it's mostly Darshan & Mariyah's body awareness & great energy & affirmations as they taught as well as the great music. Using real music & help promoting them in return is a great idea for fitness & mind/body workouts. This video uses African healing movements, Chi Kung movements, bellydance, flamenco, little jazz, yoga mudras as well other things I don't know the origin of. The music is too awesome to really skip over as well as their energy & affirmations though others might FFW here & there at worst case & still enjoy it. This is not a workout to burn calories, the most energetic part is the practice of the bellydance hip drops & figure 8s that will tone your hips a little. This is more for relaxing you for the evening or energizing you when you're sluggish in the morning to want to work out more.
The only negative I have is though the production values are great, it's in wide screen, great lighting, good sound, 2 camera angles & zooming only rarely *no unneeded close up belly shots*... some of the editing would chop them off before they were done.
I will be looking forward to seeing more from them.

2699677,5,B000KZRP1M,"Following Tribal Fusion NYC Darshan is back this time with partner Mariayh to take you into a spell binding journey into free style, flow dance, and meditation. This program is very similar to a yoga flow dance with many of yoga poses and belly dance movements incorporated. I was eager to try this program enjoyed it and  rate it highly. It is beneficial to anyone who would welcome a change from boring harsh routines. Also dance instructors, beginning and serious dancers who want to get a warm up in with belly dance essentials along with freestyle dance, yoga postures, yet all set in perfect ambience. Every muscle in the body will benefit from this, including the eyes as a great exercise is included. The seven chakras are defined in the body areas as well as their function.  Every series of movement is designed for each of the 7 specific chakras. Allow yourself freedom to communicate with your inner self through this beautiful flow.
If you use yoga as a prelim to dance, this program helps you to smooth right into a flow dance which appears effortless and at the same time soothing as it is meditative. Claim your space as you enter by energizing it with zills, petals or what you may choose.
Darshan and Mariyah pleasantly connect with their audience, taking time to explain the importance of alignment, stepping, arm movement, all which add up to a beautiful flow chakra dance. There are beautiful hip movement techniques which blend beautifully into large hip circles that appear mesmerizing! This is more than a work out; it is a journey inward with a valuable, visible reward. This program can only benefit, dissolving stresses from everyday boring harsh routines, or great if you want to incorporate it into your warm-up prior to dance. It is a beautiful 10 minute dance in itself. The great variety of music is set to right tempo and creates the mood perfectly to allow freedom to focus, create fluid movement, and bring positive energy into your self. Relax and let yourself go.",1179532800,35,2000,4.794202898550725
8159960,5,B000KZRP1M,"I love this video. Very different than most of the drills, drills, drills videos out there. It's instructional but also encourages flow.",1524528000,,136,5.2272727272727275
8159961,5,B000KZRP1M,"I've owned this DVD for YEARS now, and it's absolutely one of my favorites.  No, it's not a ""workout"" DVD, but you certainly work.  It's calming, and grounding, and just wonderful.  I do it regularly and I highly recommend it.",1499990400,,226,4.6
8159962,4,B000KZRP1M,"I liked this DVD. The concept is lovely, the instructors down to earth and likable. The only reason it did not get all 5 stars from me is because I was expecting more of a workout. If you're on the athletic side, don't expect to break much of a sweat with this video. Otherwise I really liked it",1453939200,,295,4.103448275862069
8159963,5,B000KZRP1M,I like it.  Moves slow enough to follow and shows moves from all angles.,1447804800,,72,4.142857142857143
8159964,5,B000KZRP1M,I do this dvd from start to finish and its roughly a little over an hour. I do not mind the pauses for instruction. I i already know the move i simply do it while she decribes it. Most the time one girl is doing the move while the other instructs. then they both do the move/ routine. Going through the chakras is roughly about 45-50 minutes long. then you can do all the moves together at once in a nine minute routine. I suppose i can see other reviewers wishes for a longer finale  routine. But since i do the instruction segments (and don't stop just because the instructor has) i feel completely worked out and relaxed. yet energized. also many dvd players can let you repeat segments maybe just repeat the routine 2 or 3 times.personally i like the instruction segments you do repetitions of the moves many times. All in all i find this to be unique dvd. and i enjoy doing it. the ladies could have used another day of practice before filming. ( to get their jidders out. they seem slightly shy...ahhh the joys of simply being human)  the set they're on it plain and not distracting. however im not a perfectionist. Also i have many many dvds by worlddancenewyork and have seen this set from many different angles. :) all in all i have to give this dvd a five. despite some minor flaws.,1430611200,,1292,4.379166666666666

I guess it will take a lot of effort to learn it satisfyingly. But I'm locking forward optimistic :-))",1361145600,,184,4.138888888888889
8159968,3,B000KZRP1M,"First off, this is a lengthy DVD because of the instructional section and the dance flow is about 9 1/2 minutes. Going through each of the 7 chakras has interesting info, especially in how and what part of they body you should be focusing on when doing the movement.  Visually, it's very low budget, but decent lighting and camera angles.  The instructors were knowledgeable, but need to brush up on their presentation and public speaking skills-they looked so nervous, especially the heavier one.  In general, it taught me about the 7 chakras and the bellydance aspect was interesting, but I don't think I'll be playing this DVD often.",1275177600,,636,4.87037037037037
8159969,5,B000KZRP1M,"Darshan and Mariyah have created an absolutely gorgeous dvd that combines several genres of dance with passionate music that reaches deep into your heart.  For details about what is on this dvd, you can read Lena's review.  I just want to tell you how I felt while doing the dvd and afterwards.  Firstly, I am not a belly dance person as I really don't like typical belly dance music.  If you are like me, don't let belly dance  in title scare you away. The dance does have some bellydance moves but they are easy to learn and it is the music that is the star here. The music is very eclectic.  It ranges from african drums (congolese,very syncopated, I believe) to Flamenco, to contemporay middle eaatern, to jazz, to new age indian yoga music.  All of this on one dvd.  Simply wonderful.  The ladies did a great job in chorographing the movement to the music.  This isn't a workout but more of a movement workshop. As they move up the chakras, I could feel which of my chakra centers were blocked and in need of more work.  While doing the dvd, I was able to get into the movement and feel the music.  However, at times I wanted the dances to be faster and longer.  Afterwards, I felt refreshed and wanted more.  That wanting more is where I do have some criticisms of the dvd. The music is sooo good that I wish that the sections were longer and that there was more movement and less talking. At the beginning of each chakra segment they give lengthy explanations.  I felt myself thinking, lets get on with it.  Also I sometimes felt restricted because I wanted to dance while they were talking. Lastly the chakra dance flow w/o talking was way too short.  Since it is a separate chapter, I suppose you can put the chapter on repeat.

If the ladies do another one of these and I hope that they will, I have a few suggestions
1) Put all of the chakra explanations in a separate chapter. Dance more, talk less.
2) Make each chakra section longer
3) Include an adequate dance warm-up.  The music was begging for a warm-up
4) Make the chakra flow dance longer and use music with more pronounced accents so that transitions are easier to follow.

All in all a great dvd that I will do over and over as I fast forward thru all the talking.",1269734400,5,2236,4.381067961165049
