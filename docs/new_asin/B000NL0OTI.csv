Bill Phillips is good at selling success, as he did in Body of Work, and you will enjoy watching this video.  However, all three of Bill Phillips' VHS tapes can be found in a DVD combo pack, now, so look for that, too.",1201564800,,329,4.2063492063492065
8179122,4,B000NL0OTI,"I think Bill Phillips gives solid health/fitness advice, but the real key to his commercial success is his ability at selling ""transformation.""  He does it again in this VHS, although you can get all three of his VHS tapes converted to DVD now, so check that out.

This volume 2 of success stories is not as impressive as Body of Work or volume 1, but it does include one contestant who goes from looking like a washed-up high school gym teacher to a male model. Almost too hard to believe that happened in 3 months!",1201564800,,516,4.421052631578948
