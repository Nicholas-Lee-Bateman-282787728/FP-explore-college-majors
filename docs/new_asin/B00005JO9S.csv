1531907,5,B00005JO9S,"Why is this show so hard to find in reruns?  I never even saw this until Nick at Nite added it to their lineup in the 1990s, but I instantly fell in love with the show and all the characters in Rhoda's life.

After 4 years as Mary Tyler Moore's best friend on the MTM show, Rhoda moved home to Manhattan so she could be near her sister Brenda (Julie Kavner, now the voice of Marge Simpson!) and pursue a relationship with Joe Gerard (David Groh).  Nancy Walker played her pushy mother Ida and Harold Gould played her dad Martin.  Both had appeared on the MTM show in those characters beforehand.  Heard but not seen was the drunken doorman, Carlton (Lorenzo Music, who helped create this show and then later on became the voice of Garfield the cat).

Season 1's opening credits had Valerie Harper, as Rhoda, telling about her life and why she moved back to New York while we saw several pictures fly across the screen in a mostly animated montage.  This opening was dropped later on, but its my favorite of all the openings used.

Here are the first season episodes for what will eventually prove to be a great DVD set:

01 - Joe (9-9-74)

Rhoda comes home to visit her sister and meets Joe Gerard (Mary Tyler Moore guest stars).

02 - You Can Go Home Again (9-16-74)

04 - Parents Day (9-30-74)

05 - Lady In Red (10-7-74)

Rhoda gets a job working for a book publisher, but the job doesn't last and she goes back to window dressing.

06 - Pop Goes The Question (10-14-74)

Joe asks Rhoda to move in with him, but she would rather they get married (Mary Tyler Moore guest stars again).

07 - The Shower (10-21-74)

Brenda throws Rhoda a last-minute wedding shower and invites her old friends from high school, except one of them (Linda Lavin) turns out to have been Rhoda's fierce rival.

08 - Rhoda's Wedding (10-28-74)

Ida manages to get Rhoda and Joe to hold their wedding at her apartment in the Bronx, causing catastrophe when Phyllis forgets to pick her up and Rhoda is forced to ride the subway IN HER WEDDING DRESS!  Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Asner, Gavin Macleod, Georgia Engel and Cloris Leachman from the MTM show guest star.  This was a 1 hour episode but always got replayed as two separate parts.

1531908,5,B00005JO9S,I was excited about Mary Tyler Moore Season #2 and now I'm thrilled to see this will be available too.  Look forward to preordering. Thank you.,1114041600,14,143,4.5
1531909,5,B00005JO9S,"This show rocked those first two years.  Who cares what the critics have to say-- Rhoda as a married woman was not just funny as all getout but was a relief to see after those 4 years as Mare's chronicly single best bud.  Rho deserved some happiness and that wedding episode delivered in spades!!

  Hey you Fox studio suit guys, you need to put this out like you did the Bob Newhart & Mary discs!

  IF YOU RELEASE IT, WE WILL BUY!!!

(PS:  What about PHYLLIS??-- Mother Dexter was the best!!)",1113955200,20,494,4.329670329670329
7940842,5,B00005JO9S,"I have been waiting and waiting for this show to be released because I am a BIG fan of MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW. I remember seeing re-runs periodically of RHODA on the tv set. I remember Joe, Rhoda's husband(who personally I liked alot) and her sistes, Barbara (who I LOVED!!). It's about time that they brought this out on dvd. And by the way where is PHYLLIS SEASON ONE and TWO? I just hope they don't take forever bringing out the rest of the seasons like they have with the rest of MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW. One thing the studios have not registered yet, is that if the prices are more reasonable than more people will go out and buy the seasons, especially in our present economical status.

I am too young to have seen this show on tv. But I will definitely be in line to buy it, when it does make an appearance.",1231545600,,812,4.2387096774193544
7940843,5,B00005JO9S,"It's hard to believe but in September 2009, it will be 35 years since Rhoda made it's premiere on CBS.  A spin-off of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda Morgenstern moves back to New York.  ""New York, this is your last chance.""  Shout! Factory is bringing Rhoda to DVD with all 25 episodes of season 1!  I find it odd, that  FOX isn't releasing this, but very happy that Shout! Factory is releasing this beautiful gem of a show and hopefully all 5 seasons (perhaps they will combine Season 4 & 5 together since Season 5 was a short run.)  Shout! Factory did a great job with That Girl, so I know we'll get the same quality and hopeuflly some DVD extras with Valerie Harper.  If we're really lucky, perhaps they will have Mary Tyler Moore comment on the Rhoda & Joe wedding.

I'm really looking forward to Rhoda on DVD!",1229558400,3,816,4.357615894039735
7940844,5,B00005JO9S,"I've been searching the internet for years now waiting for a release date for my favorite show ""Rhoda"", but still no word.  Why can't FOX get it together?  I've even voted on the ""TV shows on DVD"" website and still no word!  I used to watch the reruns they aired on the comedy channel when I was a teenager and it still remains my all time favorite situation comedy show to this day.  I hope these reviews will help expedite the release on DVD soon because I'm sick of waiting!!",1210723200,,478,4.277777777777778
7940845,5,B00005JO9S,"I agree with all of the comments. Living in the UK I never managed to see much of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. But I do remember Rhoda I seems that I only saw it in the 80s on late night re-runs on the BBC. I loved it then and I check in regularly on Amazon to see if it has been released yet. It hasn't obviously but I would buy the complete boxed set immediately.
The same thing happens here in the UK. Some of the worst shows ever created are available on DVD but some of the best, classic shows are not. There is some complete rubbish on DVD and then others are overlooked.
Of course here the BBC is owned and run buy the state and every household has to pay a license fee for it each year so technically speaking any BBC shows are owned by the British people. I understand that Fox is a private company so they obviously want to make a profit and that is where the problem lies. I am sure however that there are enough Rhoda fans out here to justify a release of the show. I also enjoyed Valerie's family, though not as much as Rhoda, and wouldn't mind seeing that again. If you like British commedy you should check out a sorely neglected show, Birds of a feather, it only has one season out on DVD even though it ran for 9 years and was consistently high in the ratings. But be warned British sit-coms usually have only about 6 episodes in a season. Yes 6!!",1202601600,,1362,4.104868913857678
7940846,5,B00005JO9S,"I love Mary, but I'm crazy about Rhoda!  Why hasn't his been released yet on DVD?  I can't wait to add it to my 70's sitcom collection.  Give us RHODA on DVD!",1196035200,,158,3.875
7940847,5,B00005JO9S,"It's been more than three decades, can we get a little ""Rhoda"" while we're still young enough to operate the television and DVD player????",1195603200,,138,4.791666666666667
7940848,5,B00005JO9S,Rhoda was a great show.  I will buy it along with the remaining seasons of Bob and Mary if you will get going and roll them out.  Thanks.,1186531200,,137,3.857142857142857
7940849,5,B00005JO9S,"OK, Fox home video, I have to chime in on this.  It is so past time to bring this show to DVD as well as to complete season's 5-7 of the Mary Tyler Moore Show!  For all of you who want to compare Mary to Rhoda, just stop being haters!  Mary and Rhoda were best frineds and loved each other like sisters.  They supported each other and complimented each other.  I for one love both of those shows and ask that Fox bring these classics to light and soon.

Respectfully,

7940850,5,B00005JO9S,"I was always extremely annoyed by the Mary Tyler Moore show whenever they portrayed Valerie Harper (Rhoda) as more dowdy and unlovable than Mary. The truth is, if you look beyond the character Rhoda was playing, she was a stunningly beautiful woman! She had gorgeous features, not to mention loads of talent and star quality. That's why I was so happy when Valerie Harper was given her own show (Rhoda) and was shown to be loveable afterall, marrying Joe.

It's important to note that the show was a huge hit, lasting 4.5 seasons. It was nominated for multiple Emmies every year, including best comedy and best leading actress (Valerie Harper). Valerie Harper won an Emmy and a Golden Globe the first season for best leading performance in a comedy series.

This really needs to be released on DVD.",1154131200,8,798,4.77536231884058
7940851,5,B00005JO9S,"Don't get me wrong Mary Tyler Moore was a ""nice"" character, but waaaaaay overrated!!!! Rhoda was so much more funnier, prettier, and well deserving of her own show!!!

Although I watched this show in re-runs ( it's original run was before my time), I really enjoyed Rhoda living the single life in New York during the Sensational Seventies!!! Valerie Harper JUST PLAIN ROCKED AS RHODA! She had a great relationship with her sister Brenda, was time enough for her pain in the butt mother ( played by the very funny Nancy Walker), she had a really cool apartment, and I just loved those fabulous scarfs she wore on her head. Very Chic!!!
The 1970's was such a fantastic era for some of the best sitcoms ever created and Rhoda was among them!!! The story lines were well written and the dialogue was really funny, unlike the pathetic sitcoms currently wasting valuable network airtime today!!! I don't even bother to check the tv guide anymore, I'd rather watch Nick at Night or TV Land instead!!!
Well bad tv is an entirely different and depressing subject so I'll just say my prayers and hope the powers at be are listening and RELEASE RHODA ON DVD PRONTO!!!",1115424000,40,1157,4.671568627450981
