7873606,5,6304493584,"Sha na na ! Those are the three words I have to utter. I think that A Very Brady Sequel is one of the most hilarious movies ever to hit the cinemas. KEEP IT! Im telling you, youll never want to throw it away once you own it, its like a plate of amazing spaghetti, and nothing says lovin like a tummy full of alices spaghetti! But seriously guys, Marcia, Jan and Greg are the main characters in the sequel and they are so incredibly hilarious, there is no other word to describe it. Jan Brady is completely insane and psychopathic, worst than the original movie and this time around she doesnt have multiple personalities like Sybil. Marcia knows exactly what to say to everything Jan does, lines such as ""Ill go first cause' im the prettiest"" and ""oh honestly jan"" will have you and your families busting a gut (or two) (or three) at this cinematic classic. DO NOT GO ON WITH OUT THIS FOLKS it is once in a lifetime movie! Forget about watching your figure for your new boyfriend, forget out dillydallying, now is the time to get this treasure before it dissapears like bobby and cindy with a magic kit! IT IS EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT!",1081468800,2,1142,4.4688995215311005

7873608,5,6304493584,both these movies are really fun to watch. and it is interresting how they did a great job spoofing the t.v. show a little bit with out it turning out bad.,1041897600,,155,4.032258064516129
7873609,4,6304493584,"I was never a fan of the 70's Brady Bunch sitcom perhaps because I didn't grow up then or, more suitably, because the idea of a happy family in today's modern world seems just to good to be true.
However, when creator Sherwood Schwarz made a movie, I was very impressed.  Rather than rehashing the mawkish sitcom in where one member of the family encounters some minute mishap of which inevitably is solved at the end of the episode, Scharz decided to turn his classic sitcom into a spoof and what better than to transport the zany family into the nineties.
Most of the hilarity in the film eminates from the fact that the Bradys' innocence, naivity and perfection against the harsh world of the 90's is no match. All characters are practically cloned which makes the film even more impressive.
The plot is wafer thin but who cares? Mike Brady's house is up for repossession and it is up to the family to save it.  The question is how?  A very funny solution ensues. The sister rivalry between Jan and Marsha works very well and again contributes to most of the laughs within the movie.
To say anything else would ruin the movie so sit back and enjoy. You won't be disapointed!",1036627200,2,1177,4.516431924882629
7873610,4,6304493584,"The movie is funny! It is risque, but not crude, which is nice. Above all it has great writing. The actors are fine (but it is painfully clear when an original cast member takes a cameo that they do not have the talent of the orignal cast, which is surprising. Who knew the cast of the Brady Bunch was talented? That is no doubt one of the reason's behind the tv show's success.)
Lots of comedy about sexuality, but no where near the gutter level of post ""Something About Mary"" comedy.
Even though I said it is a good comedy and well worth seeing, I have to warn you that it also left me feeling sad and empty. The premise was funny - the Brady's are stuck in the sunny 70's the rest of the world is in the cruel 90's - but the postmodern cynicism is bleak.",1022284800,,757,4.121621621621622
7873611,5,6304493584,"This movies is exactly what Howard Stern would do if he could make an episode of the Brady Bunch.  The whole concepts of putting the Bradys in numerous sexual situations (including Alice who is a big perv in this movie) makes it hilarious.  Yes, it helps if you have seen the original TV series.",1012867200,,295,4.444444444444445
7873612,5,6304493584,"These movies are very funny ! if u like the Brady Bunch.  you have to buy this.  its great for the Music acts.  the 1st one has "" its a sunshine day "" and "" keep on ""  the 2nd movie has that song when peter's voice changes.  and good time music.
