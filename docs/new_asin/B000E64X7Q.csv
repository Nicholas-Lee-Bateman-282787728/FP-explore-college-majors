8106326,5,B000E64X7Q,This DVD goes really well with the book.  Baione (Chair of guitar at Berklee) gives you extra tips that aren't found in the book and also explains areas of confusion.  It also has play a longs so you can play with either part of a duet.  I highly recommend the DVD but make sure you don't buy it by itself or it will do you no good.,1172016000,2,332,3.925373134328358

This DVD really helped me out with getting more in touch with scales and chords and just overall improving my technique. I've never really gotten around to getting actual guitar lessons, i've mostly just been learning from friends, so i really enjoyed the close up shots on the fret board and the hands to really take in the technique for different stuff. Also, the thing thats great about having this DVD is that it's a lot of like a private lesson but you can watch it whenever you have time. I would definitely recommend this DVD to any guitar player who is looking for a professional lesson on guitar technique and learning more about playing. this DVD will make anyone a better player.",1138579200,3,783,4.444444444444445
8106328,5,B000E64X7Q,"I am a high school music teacher.  One of the classes I teach is a guitar class.  I have bought William's books: Melodic Rhythms, Reading Studies, and Advanced Reading Studies.  After introducing the books to my students, I realized that their reading and playing levels had gone up.  That was five years ago, and I have been using the books ever since.  A couple of weeks ago, I got this DVD and I was very impressed with it.  I have been sharing it with my class and they love it.  You learn skills like scales, guitar technique, voice-leading approaches, etc.  If you are a teacher or student thinking about buying this DVD you should.  I know you will learn a great deal from this DVD.",1138147200,2,689,4.448
