8586062,5,B00CTF9244,"spoiler alert: Vampire Prosecutor - season one
A prosecutor, tormented by the death of a loved one, is turned into a vampire by the bad guy that he is chancing.  More of an involved, on-the-scene investigator, the prosecutor seems able to see aspects of the crime when his eyes turn blue behind sunglasses, and he sees more clues when he drinks the blood of the murdered victim.  He is always actively involved with investigating and solves the crime.  He is not the usual vampire, he can even go out side during the day in the sunlight.
Westerners more used to watching TV crime dramas like CSI, Law and Order and western crime dramas will find this show very strange.  Vampire mystic fiction and forensic lab science work together, but the vampire prosecutor relies mostly on his own talents.  Also, different and strange is the Korean over the top and even sometimes hamed up acting style and some of the characters even over react to the point of being hysterical.  The main characters, when compared to those in western TV shows, seen to be rather young and their costumes sometimes seem more suited for a weekend disco than for an on the job professional.  Supporting actors and cast as for example uniformed police officers seem much more of what one would expect.  My favorite murder mysteries of all, will always be British, especially Agatha Christie.
The episodes are fast action.  The plots are very confusing and complicated and with many unexpected twists and turns.  The offbeat quirky aspects of the writing holds my interest.  This TV show is definitely different.  However, having to read subtitles quickly makes watching rather difficult.
The episodes end with the vampire prosecutor in court convicting the murderer.  The prosecutor then goes to an after work private vampire club to drink human blood.  In one episode he tells the owner/host that he can feel the pain of the human victim whose blood he is drinking.  I will definitely watch season two.",1441497600,,1973,4.865269461077844

8586064,5,B00CTF9244,"Try ordering this both season 1 and 2 direct from an Asian importer in Hong Kong. I purchased Season 2 for under $25.00 including shipping. I don't remember what I paid for Season 1, but it was about the same! I think the series is wonderful and highly recommend viewing. It shows that foreign television series can be just as good or better than the crap that American studios push out.",1403481600,2,387,4.464788732394366

I will watch it on Dramafever and hope that the price comes down in time. This is supposed to be a Korean series...just outrageous that is coming from all over Europe.",1398902400,,311,4.473684210526316
