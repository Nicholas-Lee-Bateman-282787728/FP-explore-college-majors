4109947,5,B003CPPY0Q,"Well, I guess if others can write a review of a DVD set more than two months before it is even released, I can too.

For Stooge fans, the long road is finally over.  The shorts with Joe Besser are  going to be available on home video.  Fans who appreciate the Stooges in all of their incarnations applaud Sony for issuing the Columbia shorts to the end.  I'm sure that as they got into the volumes with Shemp, sales dropped off.  That and the dreadful economy could have made the company cancel the remaining volumes.  But they didn't and I believe that this fact alone earns this set a five star rating.

As for the shorts themselves, they are not the best work of the guys.  There are a lot of repeat plots and stock footage used in both the remaining Shemp shorts and in some of the Joe shorts.  But contrary to a previously posted review, this didn't happen because the Stooges ran out of gas or were ""tired"".  This was because Columbia was cheap!!  In the middle and late fifties the shorts' market in the US dried up.  The one word reason - television.  The Stooges were a dying breed.  Who could have guessed that the very medium that killed their lucrative shorts career would provide them their highest level of fame and financial success!!

Also Joe is not a fan favorite of many people.  But let's face it - he didn't have a lot to work with.  The scripts were weak and as mentioned above Columbia tried to use stock footage whenever possible to save money.  But there is a childish lilt in the acting style of Mr. Besser.  If you can make it past the anemic plots and just look at Joe on the screen, I think you'll see that he brought his own personality and comedy to the team.

So in review, this is a completeist's dream.  I thank Sony for listening to the Three Stooges' fan base and completing the volumes.  The picture quality on the previous sets has been remarkable and should remain that way on this final volume since they are much ""newer"" prints.  And this set is providing three discs for the price of two in previous volumes (as least according to the price on March 23).  Value and programs never released to the home market!  What more could you ask for?!",1269302400,111,2182,4.379052369077307
4109948,4,B003CPPY0Q,"This set will feature the last 16 Shemp shorts, and the 16 shorts Joe Besser made with the Three Stooges. Many of the Shemps were remakes with much stock footage. But there are two completely Original Shemp shorts here, Gypped in the Penthouse, and one of my favorite Shemp's, Blunder Boys, a parody of Dragnet. The last four Shemp's are the ""Fake Shemp"" shorts, made after Shemp passed away. Joe Palma, a Columbia performer, doubled for Shemp, with his back to the camera. Then we get the 16 Joe Besser shorts. Some say these are the worst shorts the Stooges ever made. But some of them aren't too bad. Sony has confirmed this will be a THREE disc set, not two. Thank you Sony for releasing all 190 Columbia shorts. Now how about releasing ""Have Rocket, will Travel""?.",1269216000,6,769,4.579710144927536
4109949,3,B003CPPY0Q,"A ""Stooge Completist"" dream. The final release of the Three Stooges Collection that brings together in chronological order all 190 shorts from Columbia. This set has been lovingly put together by Sony that will satisfy any Stoogaphile. OK....so why the 3 star rating after all this praise? Well, the entire set will receive a 4 and a half star rating overall, however casual Stooge fans should know that Volume 8 will contain almost no original material. By the mid fifties the Stooges were running out of steam, they had ""been there, done that"" for over 20 years and fresh material was hard to come by. Also, Shemp was ill and would pass away during this era and most of his final shorts were remakes of previous films using stock footage or a body double. After his death, the studio brought in Joe Besser as the third stooge, who never really fit in. Besser didn't allow Moe to hit, slap, or poke him, depriving the Stooges of most of their signature physical humor. Added to this, Columbia decided for business reasons to wind down their short subject department, so little money was spent on the few remaining shorts. The stooges appeared doomed to obscurity. Luckily the story has a happy ending. Television helped revive the Stooges popularity and that inspired Larry and Moe, along with the ""much-better-than-Besser"" Curly Joe to go back to the studio in the 1960s and crank out a few fair to middling full length theatrical release movies. The baby boom generation would not let the stooges die and their cult status is secure.

I enjoyed them all, and it was a treat getting to see many that looked new to me that I don't remember having seen before in my life (I'd watched it a lot when I lived in Chicago in the late '70s on channel 32).  Tbh, towards the end many shorts got boring to watch as they were remakes, many w/ recycled stock footages.  They were still fun to watch anyway because I'd recognize the differences b/t the shorts used.  I'm one of the few fans of Besser because he rarely let Moe get away from hitting him, and I didn't like how bossy he was, having the other guys suffer and not get back at him every time.  I know, it's just for show.  Smile.  I also loved watching Christine Mcintyre every time she appeared; ditto for Emil Sitka.

4109964,5,B003CPPY0Q,"This volume marks three things: Shemp's final appearance, Joe's first appearance and the end of the world's most funniest slapstick comedy team of all time. I loved this volume very much. All the shorts were hilarious. Most of the shorts in this volume are remakes of other shorts. After Shemp's death, Moe originally wanted to end the Stooges, but Larry insisted that they should continue and find a new third stooge. They wanted Curly Joe Derita to join at first, but he was busy with other things, so they hired Joe Besser. I like Joe, but I don't think he was much of a Stooge as Curly and Shemp. He did okay, but he was too sensitive. For example, Curly and Shemp liked getting hit with pies, but Joe didn't. This volume includes classics such as: ""Blunder Boys"", ""Outer Space Jitters"", ""Hoofs and Goofs"", ""Fling in the Ring"", ""Husbands Beware"", ""Sappy Bullfighters"" and ""Oil's Well That Ends Well"". This was the last volume that I've bought (not on here).

4109985,5,B003CPPY0Q,"It's 1955,and shortly before year's end,Columbia Pictures loses one of its superstars,Samuel ""Shemp Howard"" Horwitz. If having the thankless task of replacing his and Moe's enormously popular brother Curly Howard wasn't enough,the good Lord called Shemp home on November 23,1955. Shemp had just exited a boxing arena and on his way home in a taxicab with a buddy,60-year-old Shemp dropped dead of a heart attack after completing 73 shorts with Moe and Larry Fine. Two all-original shorts were released in '55,GYPPED IN THE PENTHOUSE where the Stooges are members of the Woman Haters club,reminding many of the Stooges' 1934 debut short and BLUNDER BOYS with the trio spoofing the then-on-the-air crime drama DRAGNET. The saga of remaking the 1947-49 shorts continues with the other '55 releases FLING IN THE RING,OF CASH AND HASH,BEDLAM IN PARADISE,STONE AGE ROMEOS,WHAM BAM SLAM and HOT ICE. Original scenes include Shemp falling asleep and dreaming he died and went to heaven in BIP. Shemp meets two devils and the male one,Mr. Heller(guest star Phil Van Zandt),visits Moe and Larry on Earth. The boys locking horns with armed armored car robbers in OC&H. The (fake)bearded trio exhibiting a stone-age film for a museum curator in SAR. Shemp swallowing the Punjab Diamond for the second time,requiring surgery,Stooge-style in HI. In '56 came HUSBANDS BEWARE with Moe and Larry married to Shemp's overweight,nasty sisters. The boys play their own sons in CREEPS and the boys tell their sons about when they were movers and cleaned out a haunted castle,using stock footage from THE GHOST TALKS. In FLAGPOLE JITTERS,the boys accidentally capture two bank bandits. FOR CRIMIN' OUT LOUD has the last original scenes of Shemp,working at the Miracle Detective Agency. Four films were yet to be done despite Shemp's eternal absence and Joe Palma filled in for the remainder of the contractual period with RUMPUS IN THE HAREM,HOT STUFF,SCHEMING SCHEMERS and COMMOTION ON THE OCEAN. The last sixteen shorts featured newly-inaugurated Joe Besser playing the third Stooge beginning with HOOFS AND GOOFS. Joe dreams that the boys' sister has died and was reincarnated as a horse and expectant mother. Birdie(Moe in drag) then appears alive and well. H&G inspired the sequel HORSING AROUND with Birdie in search of her circus mate Schnapps. The short era ends,in aspect of production,with FLYING SAUCER DAFFY but in aspect of release,SAPPY BULLFIGHTERS. Filming of FSD commenced on December 20,1957,thus ending the Stooges' 19-year association with longtime director Jules White.",1374105600,,2567,5.30958230958231

4109990,4,B003CPPY0Q,"At last, all Stooges shorts in on 8-volume set.  As you can imagine, I haven't seen these last 32 shorts in decades!  The obvious reason, stooge fans treat these films like poison for some reason.  People generally treat Shemp Howard, Joe Besser (and Joe DiRita in the feature films), as if they were Ashton Kutcher stepping into Charlie Sheen's shoes on ""2 Men"".  I, however, do not.  I grew up watching Joe Besser on the Jack Benny Show, the Abbott and Costello Show, etc.  Because of Joe's ""non-hitting"" contract, the Besser films are more farce than slapstick.  Sure, they used stock footage from earlier films, but the focus ought to be on the new footage, where Moe and Larry have new bits, and many scenes with other actors like Emil Sitka, Phil Van Zandt, Gene Roth, Benny Rubin, and dames (sic)
like Harriet Tarler, Muriel Landers, Lou Leonard (from Married...With Children), and the Julie Newmar-esque Greta Thyssen.  In ""Sappy Bullfighters"", she blows away all memories of Suzanne Kaaran in ""What's The Matador"".  That reminds me, look for a pre-Bonanza Dan Blocker as a zombie alien in ""Flying Saucer Daffy"".  I, myself, find it fascinating to see how they used creative editing to re-shoot the older films, pad it with scenes not involving dead stooges, and seeing Joe Palma's back for when Shemp needs to be in the huddle, in the posthumous 1956 films.
  It would not be wrong to say that this volume is for hardcore stooge fans like me, but for those whom are not, I advise you to remove whatever ""Curly"" blinders you may have, and enjoy these films on their own merit.

Honestly, as big a Shemp fan as I am, the 1955-56 period was the weakest for the Moe, Larry, Shemp trio. Remake after remake, some truly abysmal: see ""Hot Ice"" and ""Flagpole Jitters"", and of course, the 4 shorts made after poor Shemp had passed on. But there are a few gems hidden within this collection. ""Blunder Boys"" is a terrific Dragnet spoof & Moe does a dead-on Jack Webb impersonation. It makes you wish writers like Felix Adler would have been given more opportunities to turn out all original films.

As for the Besser era, the less said the better. Nothing personal against Joe, he was a funny man working opposite Lou Costello, but as a stooge, his sissy-man character just didn't mesh with the rough & tumble stooges. But there are a few above average Besser outings. ""Oil's Well That Ends Well"" and ""Quiz Whizz"" are the best of the lot.

Overall, Volume 8 is definitely the weakest offering of the entire collection, but as I said before just having all 190 3 stooges shorts is a dream come true, warts and all.",1354492800,,1273,4.478448275862069

4110005,5,B003CPPY0Q,"This is a bittersweet compilation of the final Shemp shorts, along with those with ""fake Shemp"" and Joe to complete the Three Stooges Collection that begins with the Curly years in Columbia. Witness the final spiral downward spin of the Columbia Shorts Department which closed its gates to the Stooges in 1958 and the Three Stooges making a comeback with the advent of its first run of shorts on TV nearly a year later.

To me, Joe's act is hard to swallow although I like Merry Mix-Up and the UFO related skits. His replacement, Curly Joe, is welcome, although he was no Shemp nor Curly, and the shorts run ended with Joe. Moe and Larry began to age in the Joe shorts. It will be tedious to watch the old guys do their stuff in their later movies.
The essence of the Three Stooges still lies in their 190 Columbia Shorts.

This review will not only be on this product, but to the entire Three Stooges Collection from Volume 1 (1934-1936) to 8. This collection completed my copies of the Columbia shorts run of the Three Stooges from Curly to Joe as third man. In chronological order, too. All of the discs were bought through Amazon and they came ahead of time and in the best condition. Thank you, Amazon, and thank you very much Columbia and the Three Stooges heirs for the job well done.",1296950400,3,1291,4.466101694915254

They almost released the series as we remembered them. The release of these shorts wide-screen does nothing for the films, except crop out gags and other bits of comedy business, that are off to the sides and top of the frame. I hate to complain, but so many studios decide to mess with a working formula when it comes to classic releases.

4110010,2,B003CPPY0Q,"This the final volume(#8)in the Three Stooges Collection,represents the worst of the worst in the Three Stooges canon. They cover shorts from Jan/55 to June /59. Shemp is seen in definite decline both physically and as a comedian trying to do his usual funny business;truth be told,he was no longer the bright light he originally was,in these films. The only thing that made the last group of shorts work at all was the addition of Shemps replacement,Joe Besser. Besser's stock and trade was doing his limp-wristed effeminate routine. If for instance he was hit he might say""That huuurt"" and then with fist clenched and in the upright position,tap the shoulder of the perpetrator. It was a style that,depending on the material at hand,either melded perfectly with the Stooges comedy or worked against it.
In November of /55 Shemp passed away and Columbia naturally kept on issuing shorts they had already filmed. When they ran out of that material they started to make shorts mixed with a hodge podge of past footage until about a year later(!)when they issued their last Shemp short. The last four shorts have to be seen to be believed and it may certainly be said that no one could accuse Columbia,and especially Jules White,of ever having good taste. In Rumpus in the Harem Shemp is obviously subbed by another ""look alike"" actor. The next one Hot Stuff they even have the stand in Shemp talk(!)with a voice that is no where near Shemps at all. The next short Scheming Schemers has another fake Shemp falling out of bed and then later behind a bag of tools and pipes saying""Hold your Horses"" in a most non Shemp tone. Shemps last short is Commotion on the Ocean with Shemp most of the time off somewhere else and Columbia using stock connecting footage to integrate him into the ""plot"".The over dubbing in this one is bad with lips sometimes not matching the voice. And even Moe gets subbed in this one near the end. He is supposed to be a woman but you can plainly see it is NOT Moe at all,but someone else. These last four shorts besides being in bad taste are really,sorry to say,an affront to Shemps memory.
The remakes and use of stock footage is ramped up in this collection to unparalleled heights. Only a scant handful use all original footage and most of them are the Bessers. Just a FEW examples of this are: Fling in the Ring was a remake w/footage from Fright Night,Bedlam in Paradise is practically the entire reused short of Heavenly Daze,Stone Age Romeos uses footage from I'm a Monkeys Uncle,Wham Bam Slam uses footage from Pardon My Clutch,Creeps uses footage from The Ghost Talks,Flagpole Jitters is a remake w/footage from Hocus Pocus,Scheming Schemers is a remake of Vagabond Loafers,A Plumbing we Will Go w/footage from Half Wits Holiday,Rusty Romeos is a remake of Corny Casanovas w/ stock footage,Pies and Guys is a remake of Half Wits Holiday,Oils Well that Ends Well is a remake of Oily to Bed,Oily to Rise,Triple Crossed is a remake w/footage from He Cooked His Goose and finally the last short in the series is a remake of Whats the Matador. In the last one watch for a glimpse of Curly in the reused footage;maybe an appropriate tribute(a closing circle?)and a reminder of the Three Stooges glory days. A short of note here is Blunder Boys. It is a remake of the then new TV show Dragnet and despite a promising start the short in the end fails to hit the mark.
Technically,as always, these films on these three discs(instead of the usual two),have been remastered in Hi Def and look wonderful.
There are two shorts that I know of that were NOT released in this new series with their original theatrical titles and they are:Three Little Sew and Sews(Jan6/39),originally called Three Goofy Gobs and The Tooth Will Out(Oct. 4/51),originally called A Yank at the Dentist. I don't know why but probably renamed for syndication(for whatever reasons)and not thinking it any big deal to dig into the archives for the originals at this late date;and who would notice anyway?
Well this series has certainly been a marvelous experience,in that we finally can view these films in their original splendour(minus two of course)with the wonderful remastering Sony has done here. The Stooges started out spottily but soon climbed up to a level sometimes at or near the best of the day. It is certainly not hard to make an argument that when Curly left The Stooges slowly but surely started slipping. He was really a brilliant light and no one could really replace him. However Shemp managed to keep the juices flowing for a couple of years but even Shemp started to decline and by the time Joe came in the Stooges were just a shell of their former selves. The routines and over-reuse of stock footage to create ""new"" shorts had been repeated so much that they were misfiring more than often than not. Besser did the best he could but in the end it was a losing proposition and the actual end finally came a year after The Stooges had actually stopped working for Columbia!
It was not to be all doom and gloom for The Three Stooges however. Moe appeared on the Today Show in the early 60s trying to sell himself in a more serious/intellectual style of comedy than the public had been used to seeing. It was an impossible sell. In a very short time however the Stooges shorts had become so popular on television that Moe decided to bring The Stooges out of retirement and hired a new team partner Curly Joe Derita. These three men went on to make several movies and toured extensively as the Three Stooges became popular all over again. As a personal aside,it was at the CNE in Toronto in Nov/63 that I was fortunate enough to see these three funny men on that leg of their tour.
If you are a Three Stooges fan these volumes are essential viewing and a must have for your collection. They have never looked as good as they do now and The Stooges are set to enamour a new generation of potential fans of the world's most well known knuckleheads!",1278547200,12,5958,4.664448669201521

4110012,5,B003CPPY0Q,"When I was a kid in the late 50's/early 60's I watched The Three Stooges religiously, and loved them all, but I have to admit, I couldn't wait until they got around to showing the episodes with Joe Besser.  At the time, it was probably due to the fact that he only made 16 shorts, and they wouldn't show up as much as the ""Curly's"" and ""Shemp's"", so they became more of a rare treat.  And the fun and catchy new introduction of the boys singing ""hello, Hello, Hell-O...HELLO!"" got you psyched for the mayhem about to begin!  Looking at them today with a more mature and knowledgeable eye, and with the recent viewing of Volumes 1-8 in chronological order, under my belt, the cheapness of the sets, the ""dumbing"" down of the writing and the recycling of old footage and scripts becomes more obvious, I agree, but the fun, smiles, and obvious  talent and love for their craft that The Stooges exude never fades!  I have to agree with other reviewers, if they only had better scripts, larger budgets and more creative control, I think the partnership of Moe, Larry and Joe would have grown and flourished.  Well, you can't change the past, but you can enjoy the present, so pick-up all 8 sets ASAP!!!

For my two-cents, my favorite ""Joe"" episode has to be ""Fifi Blows Her Top""......

Also, for those who would like to explore further the ""controversy"" over whether Joe would allow ""eye-pokes"", ""slaps"" and other general physical mayhem, look him up on Wikipedia, and let quotes from Joe himself give the last word......",1278028800,9,1516,4.630597014925373
4110013,5,B003CPPY0Q,"Despite the untimely death of Shemp Howard in 1955 and major cut backs at Columbia Pictures the ""Three Stooges"" continued to make shorts even though the end of an era was near. Because of budget problems at Columbia there was a definite need to reuse and recycle old stock footage with varying degrees of quality to produce more shorts and an even bigger problem for Moe Howard; who would replace Shemp?

It's no secret that Moe's first choice was Joe DeRita but because of contract obligations he would have to settle for another vaudeville veteran Joe Besser. I'm sure that many fans out there have found the shorts with Joe Besser just as funny but he never quite did it for me. I have always wondered what direction the ""Three Stooges"" would have taken if Joe DeRita would have became a stooge when Moe originally came calling. Love him or hate him, Joe Besser will always be the forgotten stooge.

Sony Pictures must be commended once again for finally listening to the fans after all the years of inferior shorts in the public domain and devoting precious time and meticulous care into the restoration of the final 32 stooge shorts found in Volume 8 as well as their entire remastered ""Stooges"" collection to date. It should also be noted that this collection contains three discs this time and Sony did not increase the price for fans.

All 32 shorts from 1955-1959 are presented on three single sided discs and packaged in slim cases. The disc artwork and packaging is fantastic to say the least, making Volume 8 even more attractive and highly collectible for any Stooge fan to own. The 32 newly restored & remastered shorts from Sony Pictures are once again presented in chronological order, politically incorrect and in Beautiful Black & White. I think Sony Pictures did an excellent restoration job to bring us this final collection. In my opinion the final 32 shorts look amazing & the remastered soundtrack is perfect.

Sony Pictures, you have given us ""Stooge"" fans exactly what we've always wanted; the best picture & sound possible. Thanks!

4110015,5,B003CPPY0Q,"These are already on sale here in Southern California.  Picked my copy up today.

First of all, Joe Besser is unwatchable in my opinion.  All Stooge fans know the quality (or lack thereof) of the Stooge shorts Columbia was delivering at this point.  So my review will focus on the technical.

The controversial 16x9 matting is back, blacking out nearly 1/3rd of the total frame.  Remember these were shot in 3X4 full screen, but were presented in the matted format in theaters.  They were always presented in full screen during their television run.  In most scenes, the blacked out portions aren't that intrusive.  Occasionally though, a visual aide to a joke is obscured to the point that you have to back up the DVD to study what it was.

For instance, in ""Space Ship Sappy"", Moe is laying in a hammock discussing stocks on the financial page.  He talks about a stock slipping, to which Larry asks ""How's your American Can?""  Moe responds ""That's slipping too"".  He's referring to his ""can"" or ass which is falling out of a hole in the bottom of the hammock.  Problem is, because of the mattes we can't see the bottom of the hammock to know what he's talking about!

I discussed both sides of the matting controversy in my review of Volume 7, where they first appeared.

The title cards on the Joe Besser shorts appear to be compressed slightly from 3X4 to squeeze everything into 16X9.  It might just be my perspective, though. These live action intros were the most ""loaded"" visually of any of the Stooge title cards to this point.

Besides that, the audio is clean as is the picture.  Another quality release by Sony.  Let's hope the movie collection follows.  I believe those films (with the exception of ""The Outlaws Is Coming"") were actually SHOT in widescreen.  So the mattes contained there will be genuine.",1274918400,5,1818,4.686708860759493

4110024,2,B003CPPY0Q,"For all the comments about how some Stooge fans have a low opinion of the Joe Besser shorts, everybody seems to have forgotten that this collection doesn't mark the end of Columbia Pictures' (now Sony) association with the Stooges!  And after all, the title of this series is THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION, not THE THREE STOOGES SHORTS COLLECTION.  There's no reason to expect that there shouldn't be yet another (final) volume in this series, collecting the 5 feature films Moe and Larry made together with ""Curly Joe"" DeRita, and the one feature film compiled from clips from Curly Howard shorts.

I really hope Sony decides to do a Volume 9, collecting the five Columbia feature films made between 1959 and 1965 with Curly Joe DeRita: HAVE ROCKET WILL TRAVEL, THE THREE STOOGES MEET HERCULES, THE THREE STOOGES IN ORBIT, THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE, and THE OUTLAWS IS COMING! (and the one clip compilation film, STOP! LOOK! AND LAUGH! featuring Curly Howard). I realize that nearly all of these have been previously released on DVD (the sole exception being Have Rocket Will Travel for some reason), but I avoided buying them individually in the past because of the cost involved (and that damn missing DVD of Have Rocket Will Travel, possibly the best of all their features). It would be nice to see Sony release these in a 2-disc collection, 3 films per disc, in the standardized packaging and the standardized pricing used for this series.",1271980800,13,1465,4.828685258964144

4110026,5,B003CPPY0Q,"I agree with the other reviewers in giving kudos to Sony Pictures for following through with packaging ALL the Stooge shorts for DVD. Unlike some collections which seem to stall halfway and frustrate fans to no end, Sony stuck to their guns here. And thank goodness they didn't split the remaining shorts into TWO last volumes. Although this period is usually considered the weakest of the team's efforts, what with the ""fake Shemps"" & recycled material, they're still an important part of the Stooge saga. Some fans don't particularly care for Joe Besser, who was brought on board to fulfill their short subject contract. But I thought he was pleasantly amusing, with his girlish whines making him sort of an ""effeminate Curly"". He deserves credit for bringing his own uniqueness to the team...and of course, there was always Moe & Larry, two dependable, hard-working clowns who did their best in spite of anemic budget cuts & woeful storylines. It says a lot about the Stooges to manage fleeting moments of genuine comic inspiration amidst all this mess.
Of course, the Stooges would go through one more incarnation after the shorts when burly ""Curly"" Joe DeRita joined & the team became movie stars in the twilight of their careers; quite an accomplishment, if you think about it.
Volume 8 will kind of feel like reading an epic novel: You can't wait to see how it ends!",1271030400,12,1373,4.846808510638298
4110027,5,B003CPPY0Q,"This final volume of Stooge shorts is interesting on two levels. First, it represents the transition from the Shemp Howard years to the Joe Besser years, with many familiar plots and gags being lifted from older comedies. Some of these patchwork shorts are very clever: OF CASH AND HASH is a slick reworking of SHIVERING SHERLOCKS; CREEPS is probably better remembered than its inspiration THE GHOST TALKS. BLUNDER BOYS, an amusing parody of ""Dragnet,"" is noteworthy for using entirely fresh material (even if the battlefield ""exterior"" looks like it cost five dollars to stage).

But this set is even more interesting to film buffs, as a living record of the end of an era, and as a fascinating exhibition of creative film editing. SCHEMING SCHEMERS deserves a special Oscar for the editing, with footage from three older comedies spliced into the new material. By the time Joe Besser joined the Stooges in 1956, two-reel short subjects were 99% extinct, and only Columbia and the Stooges were still making them. This actually had a liberating effect on the series. There is a new, free-wheeling, we-don't-care spirit about these last shorts that is missing from the half-hearted, script-bound remakes of the mid-fifties. The budgets are at a new low and the action is milder, but the Stooges are more relaxed and they improvise freely: Larry reciting Hamlet's soliloquy while chewing gum is a lunatic moment from FIFI BLOWS HER TOP; Joe scores in a shipping-room routine in MUSCLE UP A LITTLE CLOSER; Moe abandons his bossy role for dialect character comedy in SWEET AND HOT. There are many inside jokes for fans: OIL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL slips in a reference to writer Felix Adler; SAPPY BULLFIGHTERS has a poster headlining one Julio Blanco -- namely, producer-director Jules White; and more than one short shamelessly plugs Columbia's feature films then playing in theaters! The writers experiment with new ideas (including references to science-fiction and rock-and-roll), familiar ideas (the usual slapstick with pies, shotguns, and other weapons), and even ancient ideas (SWEET AND HOT sets the Stooges' act all the way back to 1934's WOMAN HATERS, with the same screenwriter again casting the trio as three unrelated characters in a musical comedy). The final Stooge short filmed, FLYING SAUCER DAFFY, was actually recorded in stereo; Columbia does have a broadcast video master in stereo, and hopefully it will be included in this DVD set. (Update: It isn't; Richard Gallagher of Home Theater Forum confirms that the track is mono. However, Mr. Gallagher raves about the picture and sound quality throughout the entire set.)

True, you will see plenty of old material repeated throughout this set, but there are also some new routines that you'll only see here. Fully half of the Joe Besser shorts were filmed from scratch, with new, original stories and no recycled scenes. You'll also recognize Columbia regulars Emil Sitka, Gene Roth, Philip Van Zandt, Benny Rubin, George J. Lewis, Harriette Tarler, Joe Palma, and Frank Sully supporting the Stooges. If you've never bothered much with these later Stooge shorts, give them a try. These seasoned comedians still have plenty of gas in the tank.",1270598400,70,3207,5.1066666666666665

4110030,5,B003CPPY0Q,"Ted Healey, creator of the stooges was born here in my hometown,Kaufman Texas. Maybe thats why the stooges have always held a special place in my heart. These shorts will never be my favorite. I was never a big Joe Besser fan but hey, he was a stooge and i believe Mr. Besser gave it his best shot. (Surely he knew that before he signed on that slaps and eye pokes were part of the routine) I have often wished the ""movie stooge"" Joe DeRita would have been available for the last of the shorts. They might have been better received. These shorts suffer from alot of reused footage and rewritten story lines. I'm sure the stooges knew this and weren't happy but they did their best. So as a true stooge fan i can't wait to see these final shorts and enjoy the GREATEST comedy team of all time. Oh yes THANK YOU SONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1270252800,5,858,4.541935483870968

It is worth taking a vacation for. Now the next question is WHEN ARE THEY RELEASING ON BLU RAE!?...LOL. Actually, I'm happy with them on DVD and one day when I'm in the old folks home, I hope they can pull out their ancient DVD player and let me relax in peace to nothing but Stooge shorts.

Yes, I know that Volume 8 will contain shorts that have repeated plots, the stooges are older and without Curly and Shemp, but it will take me back to my childhood days when I did not care what short was on, as long as I just got to watch, I was happy.

To everyone else that REVIEWED, I wish we could all get together in a big room, put on the big widescreen and enjoy this proud day of June 1, 2010 together. Lucky for me that my 11 year old daughter and 14 year old son enjoys watching.

SO STOOGE FANS UNITE AND GET EXCITED, the time is near, Just 2 more months from this time victory will be at hand.

4110033,5,B003CPPY0Q,"THANK YOU Sony!!!
  You are going to give me my wish and make all my dreams come true. ALL the 3 Stooges shorts will be mine in June. I am so greateful to you for completing my collection...now I can only hope for the 3 Stooges Movie collection after????  the 7 movies would be great!",1269820800,6,284,4.127272727272727
4110034,4,B003CPPY0Q,"...but please don't start here! To really get the Stooges, go chronologically through each set starting with Volume one when they  burst into song in their very first short about woman haters, watch them ride out the Depression, make their way through the War years making great use of Moe's strong resemblence to a certain German leader of the time, enter the post-war years where they are still as great as ever but face an ever dwindling Columbia budget due to the competition from television, and even lose two beloved family members along the way. And yet, here they are, in volume eight, with their budget cut to nothing and lacking many of the people behind the cameras that understood their comedy and they are still making us laugh in the atomic age of the 1950's.

I want to thank Sony for sticking it out and marketing each and every Stooge short over the 25 year period, even if they know this last set or two is not the best work the boys did by a long shot. The transfers have been stellar. The only thing better could have been perhaps a documentary on the Stooges at Columbia, and even before if they could wrestle the rights away from Warner Brothers. I'm still holding out hope we might see that yet.

The press release for this set says that the following shorts will be included:

1955

Fling in the Ring
Of Cash and Hash
Gypped in the Penthouse
Bedlam in Paradise
Stone Age Romeos
Wham-Bam-Slam!

End of press release statements.

Among these shorts the ones on flying saucers are the best, if memory serves correctly. They allowed the most original humor from the boys and had the least use of previous Stooge material cut into the shorts.",1269820800,3,2114,4.595744680851064
4110035,4,B003CPPY0Q,"Finally, SONY is releasing the last of the shorts! At least my guess that volume 8 would be the remaining shorts, and not 1955 to 1957 with a year and a half remaining on volume 9. Granted, many of the last shorts with Shemp are either remakes or a lot of reused material from earlier shorts. Granted, that the last 4 shorts of the Shemp era were after he passed away with Joe Palma subbing for him (only seeing him from behind). But the best part of this collection is that all of Joe Besser's shorts are finally on the market. Even when the Stooges were shown on TV, there would only be a couple of Joe's shorts presented. Finally we will be able to see what has not been seen in a great many years. The only things missing from these collections are deleted scenes, bloopers, interviews with anyone still alive who worked with them, or their descendants, or their biographies. Now only one item is missing -- ""Have Rocket, Will Travel"". So SONY, when will this be released?",1269648000,9,976,4.427777777777778
4110036,5,B003CPPY0Q,"Appropriate words of praise for Columbia/Tri-Star! But we'll soon be able to hear them spoken by the gorgeous ""newsboy girl"" with the bulldog voice in the hilarious opening scene of ""For Crimin' Out Loud"", Shemp's last filmed footage. Since the Stooges were STILL making money in theatre rentals for Columbia, the studio continued to crank out these bargain-basement shorts. Of Shemp's final 16 films, all but two were re-makes: ""Gypped in the Penthouse"" (with Shemp's silly take-off on ""Home on the Range""), and the outrageous ""Dragnet"" spoof ""Blunder Boys"", which features what may be the Stooge's most bizarre moment of all time (""Alright---you guys prepare for 81-Z!"")

By now, everyone knows that Joe Palma (among his roles, he's the caveman that gets hit with the nest of eggs in ""I'm a Monkey's Uncle"") filled in for Shemp to finish out the Stooges' contract for his final four films. But because of the team's continued profitablity to the studio, Columbia hired Joe Besser & produced another two years of shorts, while the budgets continued to decline.

But Columbia should still be given credit for trying some NEW things in the Besser films to keep them fresh;  yeah, the 2 ""talking Horse"" shorts are lame, but at least they TRIED something different.  Then there's the trio of Sci-Fi films, as Columbia attempted to cash in on the current craze (I'm old enough to have seen ""Space-Ship Sappy"" in its initial theatrical run in the summer of 1958). ""Flying Saucer Daffy"" is a goofy combination of grade-Z, late-50's sci-fi and the familiar Cinderella story. And ""Outer-Space Jitters"" features a pre-Bonanza Dan Blocker as the ""Goon!""

And, despite Muriel Lander's annoying flashback scene as an obnoxious kid, I've always enjoyed ""Sweet and Hot"", which has it's own unique charm (I wonder how much it cost the studio to rig the effects for the 1-second bit when Tiny plops down on the couch and the whole room bounces from the impact?)

About 15 years ago, having just finished our Thanksgiving dinner (""Now, get out in the kitchen and ROAST THE TURKEY!""), my siblings and I gathered around the TV for some Stooge viewing (VHS, of course); and guess which film---out of ALL 190 Shorts---we chose to watch?  It was Joe Besser's ""OIL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL"" --- the only one of their films that features ONLY the stooges playing ONLY themselves---and one of my favorite films of ALL 190; we laughed ourselves silly.

Still, the Besser shorts were a sad way to close out the magnificent 24-year reign of the Stooges at Columbia. But remember, Moe and Larry were senior citizens by this time, so the style of the films necessarily changed from what it had been in their hey-day. But the trio carried on and gave their absolute professional best---and for that, I feel any TRUE Stooges fan should respect (and purchase) the ENTIRE video legacy of this legendary team.

Gosh, fellas (Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp and Joe)---THANKS A LOT! (and Columbia, too).

And while we await the release of this final, historic set, ponder these immortal lines:

""Gotta eat an apple, I'm hungry!""
""You oughta hold him on the Habeus Corpuscle!""
""I won't have time later...Then I'll kill you now!""
""The harmony's bad; we didn't have time to rehearse.""
""I got it for my Bar-Mitzvah!""
""How's your American Can?
""Do I look like Davey Crockett?""
""I hear 'em, I hear 'em---JINGLE bells, JINGLE bells!""
""And don't forget to see ""Pal Joey"", folks""
""Not me, I want to linger with the rest of the girls..""
""Incidentally, do Bar-B-Q have pits?""
""Please, my time is Linament!""
""I smell something burnin'-- that's ME sizzlin'!""
""Our key was made out of a little piece of steel""
""They thought you were Mars men----MARS MEN!!""
""That guy gets in my hair--AND my eyes!""
""How now, brown cow---ya' bubble-brain!""
""I'll have to take him out in pieces!""
""...and even the telegraph pole; SHUT UP, tadpole!""
""I told you that thing had dandruff--LEAPING Dandruff!!""

The other companies alot of times bring out a series and stop it half way through leaving the fan with an unfinished product ....

It seemed like the last set was going to take forever to be released but good things are worth the wait .... You have a customer for life Sony .... Thank you again,1269388800,6,678,4.346456692913386
