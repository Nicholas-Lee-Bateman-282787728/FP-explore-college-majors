7889822,4,630546667X,It was a nice review of musicals of the era.  I enjoyed it and it showed me other musicals that I would like to have.,1521504000,,117,3.68
7889823,1,630546667X,We were hoping to see musical numbers. What we got was poor quality and only  snippits of musicals.  There is too much talk and too little action.  I've seen better quality out of W_______ $5 DVD bin.,1333584000,,200,4.351351351351352
7889824,1,630546667X,"It's definitely an overview of musicals from the 50's, but...

If that guy says ""hammersteen"" one more time...  I think ""Die in a fire"" does apply here.

I know finding footage of these movies can be very difficult, but if you're going to make a documentary, at least try and get the names right.

Being forced to watch it right now.  I thought it was wrong to use ""cruel and unusual punishment"" on anyone...",1296086400,2,408,4.45945945945946
7889825,1,630546667X,"When I read the description of this I thought it was a movie. Instead, it turned out to be more of a theatrical trailer or a documentary. It really is boring.",1187395200,10,158,4.129032258064516
7889826,1,630546667X,"HOLLYWOOD MUSICALS OF THE 50S attempts to mislead purchasers by presenting itself as a documentary.  It is nothing of the kind: it is a collection of movie trailers held together by spurious commentary.
Like most film fans, I enjoy seeing film trailers--but I resent the manufacturer's attempt to mislead the purchaser re this disk's content.  Moreover, the trailers have not been restored, the transfer is bad, and the commentary not only gets in the way of the trailers, it offers absolutely nothing of interest in and of itself.  Avoid this psuedo-documentary at all costs.",1020729600,89,576,5.1063829787234045
7889827,4,630546667X,"This movie in today's world becomes somewhat of a fantasy and as such, takes viewers out of the horrors that surround us, and for a short time recalls happiness and decency.  What else can one say.",1017619200,5,197,4.472222222222222
