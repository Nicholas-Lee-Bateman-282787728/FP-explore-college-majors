7864347,5,6304161573,"My students and I read the book ""Be a Perfect Person in Just Three Days.""  I did not think there would be a movie made from this book and was surprised when this showed up when I decided to check and see.  Since the movie is from the nineties, it only comes as a VHS.  This movie is in good shape.  As usual with some movies made from books, the story was changed slightly but not too much and the message was retained.  The students enjoyed it.  It didn't even seem too dated.",1244332800,,477,4.075268817204301
