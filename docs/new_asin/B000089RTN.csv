1832269,1,B000089RTN,"...I can say that this film is quite simply a clunker.
  Mohsen Makhmalbaf is a thoroughly mature, highly competent film maker, and along with Majid Majidi, a real innovator in the world of contemporary Iranian film.  With this film, however, he decided to step away from his usual style of powerful character development, beautiful photography, and an interesting way of integrating  the universal qualities of human culture with the particular world view of modern Iran.
  ""Kandahar"" disappoints on many different levels.  The character development is so poor that it is hard to empathize with much of what is going on on screen.  A lot of this has to do with the screenwriting, which is simply awful.  A good example of how bad this script is can be heard in the speech that the black American doctor gives into the reporter's recorder.  Depth is attempted, but only pseudo-gravitas is achieved.  Also, the acting is inexplicably, inexcusably, and often hilariously atrocious.  Amateur casts can be excellent and convincing, as they have been in films by Makhmalbaf and Majidi before, but in Kandahar, it is so bad as to be a distraction, and only serves to point up the defincies in character development and the inanity of the dialogue.
  This film is also much praised for the beauty of its scenery, but it is not a National Geographic Special, it is a feature film that introduces a plot, introduces characters, and ostensibly seeks to develop them.  The scenery certainly is nice, but it doesn't make up for the dramatic failure of the film, and honestly, the production values in this film are average if not a little below average.  And when you finally get right down to it, it is not much of an achievement to point a camera at a mountain or a desert in Eastern Iran or Western Afghanistan. It is just unfamiliar to most viewers (or at least it was before the fall of the Taliban), and that seems to make the scenery more special than it really is.  I suppose a case could be made for the harsh terrain reflecting the harsh life under the Taliban, but that is hardly a new idea in film making, and the amount of time that this film spends lingering over the mountains and deserts of Central Asia really does absolutely nothing for a film that is just begging to be developed. Also, fanciful images in the film such as the oft-mentioned prosthetic legs flying out of the airplane, or a young Afghani pulling the ring off of a skeleton seem pretentious  in the context of such a thin plot and lack of fundamental dramatic development.
  In this film Makhmalbaf tried something new, and he simply failed.  Luckily for him, the film became instantly relevant due to the 9/11 attacks, and it received far more praise than it should have.  I liken the critical response to this film to that of ""A Time for Drunken Horses"", a better film than ""Kandahar"", but one that also gets more recognition for WHAT it is, than what it achieves as a work of cinematic art.",1080172800,14,2965,4.672447013487476
1832270,5,B000089RTN,"Kandahar is a semi-documentary about Nafas, a female reporter exiled from Afghanistan and residing in Canada.  Her journey takes her into Afghanistan and the city of Kandahar during the Taliban rule.  Her reason to get to Kandahar is to save her sister who has communicated that she intends to commit suicide during the next solar eclipse.  Her sister could not escape with the family to Canada, since she lost her legs to a landmine in their attempt to escape the country.  Now Nafas wants to get back to Afghanistan and save her sister; however, on the road to Kandahar she faces the true rule of the Taliban and understands the misfortune of the people and her sister in Afghanistan.  Kandahar is an exceptionally personal film in many aspects.  For example, Nafas is constantly defenseless, since she must put her trust into people she does not know, and this builds up a strong connection between Nafas and the audience.  In addition, many scenes cause the audience to ponder why Nafas's sister would consider suicide.  In the end, this film builds up a plethora of insights of how life might have been in Afghanistan during the Taliban rule and how women might be suffering around the world.",1073001600,6,1197,4.804878048780488
1832271,3,B000089RTN,"An Iranian film produced before the American invasion of Afghanistan, KANDAHAR isn't so much a feature film with a contiguous story as a series of 1-act plays that portray the harshness of life for women, and life in general, under Taliban rule.
Nafas (Nelofer Pazira) is a young woman of Afghani birth who emigrated as a child with her family to Canada. Her sister, who had lost both legs to a land mine, was left behind. Nafas has learned that her sister is planning to commit suicide coincident with the final solar eclipse of the twentieth century. As the film begins, Nafas is being ferried by helicopter to an Afghani refugee camp in Iran. From there, she hopes to smuggle herself across the border to KANDAHAR, where her sister lives, and persuade her to go on living.
Both the beginning and end of the film are minimalist. Instead, the viewer is witness to a series of vignettes, some almost surreal, that reflect the dismal state of the country. Of course, during her journey, Nafas wears a burkha, that head to foot drape that women must wear in public and which relegates them to the status of non-entities.
Two sequences are particularly evocative of the film's message. When Nafas becomes ill and seeks help, the male caregiver is limited by law to examining his patient's mouth and eyes through a small hole cut in a sheet barrier while asking questions via a child intermediary. And later, as a Red Cross helicopter drops prosthetic legs by parachute into a desert aid station set up to help civilians maimed by landmines, we watch a dozen or so amputees desperately scrambling on their crutches to reach the drop zone. Indeed, the prosthetics are so much in demand that a scam artist, seeking to acquire them as a goods for future enrichment, is shown bedeviling foreign medical workers.
Pazira's Nafas is attractive, and the dehumanizing effect of the burkha is striking on those occasions when she must unveil.
KANDAHAR is presented in a pseudo-documentary style. Unfortunately, while the individual sequences are hard-hitting and revealing, the lack of a unifying story, and especially the absence of substantive ending, doesn't make for a completely satisfying film. The viewers' sympathies may perhaps remain detached.",1070841600,5,2239,4.957446808510638
1832272,4,B000089RTN,"When you see ""Kandahar,"" it's almost impossible to believe that you're watching a film set in the late 20th Century.  Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film takes place in Afghanistan in the latter days of the Taliban regime, when women were not merely viewed as second class citizens, but were denied any form of education or civil rights and even had to go out in public covered from head to toe to prevent men from seeing their faces.  The filmmaker takes us to the heart of this alien and frightening world and makes us see, perhaps for the first time on the big screen, just how horrific life was for women in that time and place.
""Kandahar"" is less a narrative film than a series of fascinating vignettes that drive home the realities of life in that part of the world.  What plot there is involves the efforts of a female Canadian journalist to sneak back into her native country to prevent her desperate sister in Kandahar from committing suicide at the next solar eclipse.  But that is really just a string on which to hang the individual pearls that make up the film.  What is of primary interest to both the filmmaker and the audience are the various people the journalist encounters and the many experiences she undergoes.  Hidden beneath her own burka, she witnesses firsthand the devastating poverty, the utter degradation and de-humanization of women, and the authoritarian oppression that defined life in that country during the Taliban rule.  Along the way, she meets an American doctor who is trying his hardest to in some way relieve the misery of these people, but who finds himself waging a losing battle against the primitivism and theocratic oppression that have made life a living hell for the common citizenry of the country.  She also encounters a seemingly endless group of people who have become dismembered by all the land mines left over from the Afghani war with the Russians.  There is one remarkable scene wherein hordes of desperate, one-legged men hobble on crutches across the desert as Red Cross helicopters rain prosthetic limbs down onto the sands below.  It is merely one among many images from the film that seer themselves into the viewer's memory.  Another is a scene in which a male doctor has to examine his female patients through a hole cut out of a sheet, not even being allowed to talk to the woman directly about her symptoms but having to get his information through a male (or female child) ""interpreter.""
Makhmalbaf keeps the ending of the film deliberately ambiguous which might frustrate some viewers but which actually adds to the verisimilitude of the piece.  In the same way, much of the acting in the film borders on the amateurish at times, but again that contributes to the pseudo-documentary aura that the film must have to be truly effective.  A clear-cut narrative resolution and slick performances by obviously professional actors would likely rob the film of its much-needed sense of immediacy.
""Kandahar,"" by providing a voice to so many voiceless people, is a film that cries out to be seen.",1059264000,3,3045,4.832692307692308
1832273,4,B000089RTN,"This is an intriguing film by renowned Iranian director Mosen Makhmalbaf. It is a brief, fascinating peek at Afghanistan under the Taliban regime. Filmed before the September 11, 2001 attack on the World trade Center took place, it offers a tantalizing glimpse into a country in which few of us can imagine living.

The premise of the film revolves around an Afghani woman named Nafas (Niloufar Pazira), who has emigrated to Canada but finds herself returning years later to her homeland after her sister, who had remained behind in Afghanistan, writes her a letter announcing her intention to end her life at the time of the next solar eclipse.
In the film, Nafas is journeying to her sister in Kandahar. She finds her country, a mosaic of ethnic and linguistic communities,  totally devastated by two decades of war. It is through her eyes that the viewer sees the extreme views that have overrun her country.  It is through her eyes that the viewer sees the tragedy that is Afghanistan.

The viewer sees that education is firmly in the hands of the Mullahs, the local religious leaders who practice and instruct young boys in a strict fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.  It is an ideology that is interwoven with a chilling militancy. Despite the extreme views propounded by the Mullahs, mothers struggle to get their boys in these schools, so as to be assured that their sons will get your basic three hots and a cot in this land of famine.

Moreover, the issue of the role of women under such a repressive regime is also looked at. The viewer sees how the women are treated, denied an education,  and referred to in collective, pejorative terms (black heads), due to the burkhas they are forced to wear, at all times. The viewer also sees the devastation that war has brought to this country in terms of land mines and consequent maimings. The results of famine and poor health care are also apparent throughout the course of this film.

As a story, the film promises but, ultimately, fails to deliver a very satisfactory ending. Metaphorically, however, it delivers. Just as her sister's end is near, the end of Afghanistan under this repressive Taliban regime is also near. The film is positively prophetic, when viewed in a metaphoric light.

Though the story line is left to drift as a backdrop for the bigger picture story alluded to through the stunning cinematography, the film still manages to succeed. The film, shot entirely in natural light due to the lack of electricity on location, is vivid with its imagery of a culture and lifestyle so alien to those of us living with and surrounded by creature comforts.

The beautiful Niloufar Pazira, who is not a professional actress but, rather, an Afghani born journalist living in Canada, is wonderful as Nafas. The cast of unknown locals contribute to the vitality of this film, which is a must see for those who are interested in other cultures or in the human condition. Filmed on the Iran-Afghanistan border, the film is based in part on a similar journey  to Kabul that Niloufar Pazira had herself earlier attempted  in response to a letter from a despondent childhood friend. That journey was never completed due to the danger inherent in such a trip.

The DVD offers superlative visuals and a crystal clear audio but has only a few limited bonus options or special features. It contains an interesting featurette entitled, ""Lifting the Veil"", which is a documentary that centers around Ms. Pazira. It tells the viewer about her extraordinary life and how it came about that  this film was made.

There is also a film commentary by Ms. Pazira. What is interesting about the commentary is that it is not from a director's perspective. The commentary is from a very personal perspective and details what is meant to be conveyed by this film. Those who listen to the commentary will know that the film is about much more than its basic story line about Nafas finding her sister.  The film is about Afghanistan.",1056931200,22,3980,4.813782991202346
1832274,3,B000089RTN,"Born an Afghani, now a Canadian, Nafas (Niloufar Pazira) receives a letter from her sister who is still living in Afghanistan. Her sister tells Nafas that she can no longer live in the oppressive conditions of their homeland, and she intends to commit suicide on the last eclipse of the 20th century. Nafas journeys to Afghanistan and tries desperately to reach her sister in Kandahar before the day of the eclipse. She carries with her a tape recorder on which she records the details of her journey in hopes that the stories and voices on that tape will give her sister some reason to live. Nafas enters the country through the Iranian border and must rely on the aid of others to lead her to Kandahar. She takes any opportunity she can to get closer to Kandahar and enlists the aid of an itinerant family, a young boy (Sadou Teymouri), an American-born doctor (Hassan Tantai), and a con artist in her struggle to reach her sister before the eclipse.

""Kandahar"" is a thoughtful and beautiful film directed by acclaimed Iranian director Mohsen Makmalbaf, but it doesn't have much of a narrative. What we see is a journey more than a story. The film isn't long, but it has a languid pace, which is appropriate for traveling across a desert. Nafas is in a big hurry to reach her sister, so the film's pace also helps us empathize with her frustration. But ""Kandahar"" doesn't seem to be about Nafas or her sister. Nafas' quest is a vehicle for the images that ""Kandahar"" presents us with, images that are both strikingly beautiful and sadly absurd: a group of one-legged men racing to catch prosthetic limbs that have been dropped by parachute from a plane, a group of people clad in astonishingly bright burquas walking across the dessert, a boy who has been expelled from mullah school trading clothes with the boy who will take his place, another boy taking a lovely ring from the finger of a half-buried skeleton. We have read about the appalling conditions in Afghanistan, and you can see them up close in this film. But ""Kandahar""'s images are the film's real strength and the reason to see it. They will stick with you the way that still photographs do because they are so eye-catching and so odd.",1053648000,5,2203,4.663239074550129
1832275,5,B000089RTN,"As strange as it seems, this movie benefited greatly from the 9/11 attacks in America and the subsequent exposure the oppresive Taliban regime received in the media.  While this movie was shot in and around Afghanistan refugee camps in Iran, it shows what life was like for many in Afghanistan prior to the events of 9/11.
Based on a true story, the film follows an Afghan refugee (living in Canada) who attempts to travel from the Iranian border to Kandahar to rescue her sister who intends to kill herself at the next full moon.  However the true story is about the journey itself, not the destination.  Along the way we meet many Afghani's toiling to survive, and a few foreigners who have come to Afghanistan for different reasons.  The cast features no professional actors, mostly actual Afghanis.
The DVD has great picture and sound quality, including a very insightful commentary by, and documentary about the lead actress... whom the whole story is originally based upon.
This is not a movie for those looking for a military action piece.  This is a beautiful, thoughful, evocative film about a country with deep traditions that is quickly deteriorating.",1049241600,2,1162,4.938461538461539
1832276,1,B000089RTN,"This is a hopeless movie, totally lacking in dramatic development and tediously relentless in its depiction of the hopelessness of life under the Taliban.  I admire the determination of other Amazon reviewers to find this film worthwhile.  But I cannot agree with them.  There are one or two good scenes (primarily those involving an African-American posing as a doctor), but a few good moments and some fine photography simply do not make a good movie.",1045440000,6,453,5.013333333333334
1832277,3,B000089RTN,"Set in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, Kandahar follows the quest of Nafas (Niloufar Pazira) to illegally reenter the country three days before her sister -- whose legs were blown off by a landmine years earlier -- can carry out an intended suicide during the last eclipse of the 20th century. During her arduous trek through the war-torn wastes, Nafas encounters four distinct guides, each representing a different atrocity plaguing modern day Afghanistan: a defeated Afghan refugee; a fatherless young boy expelled from an Islamic religious school; an African-American militant turned healer; and a one-handed thief who claims to be the victim of a landmine accident. These encounters turn out to be the most structurally sound elements of an otherwise disjointed and unsatisfying narrative. The story is based on journalist Pazira's own unsuccessful attempt to reach a friend in Afghanistan after the Taliban took power. But the film is considerably less successful as a fictional odyssey through a harsh and hostile environment than it is as an exploration of modern war-ravaged Afghanistan. Substituting Iranian for Afghanistan desertscapes, director of photography Ebrahim Ghafouri captures stunning and indelible images, the most impressive coming when a group of legless men race on crutches to retrieve parachuting artificial legs dropped from a Red Cross helicopter. But director Makhmalbaf's lack of closure regarding the plot is frustrating -- we never learn whether Nafas ever reaches Kandahar and saves her sister. If the entire point is -- contrived from information gleaned via the closing frame -- that all of Afghanistan has been under an eclipse since the Taliban arrived, fine. But it needs clearer delineation to have the necessary punch so that audiences don't have to be left guessing as to what the ultimate point of the movie is, other than one of oppressed futility. The film runs a scant 85 minutes, so this was obviously an intentional decision, perhaps meant to reflect the ambiguity of international press regarding the conditions within Afghanistan (pre-September 11th). Yet Kandahar isn't a documentary, it's a feature film by one of Iran's foremost directors, and as such one would have hoped that the staging and acting were up to Makhmalbaf's usual standards. Sadly, the murky conclusion hampers an otherwise fascinating and utterly disquieting look at a place alien to many Westerners who up until recently couldn't have cared less about its people or politics.",1044144000,11,2492,5.375959079283888
1832298,5,B000089RTN,"This is more of a docudrama than a film with a plot and satisfying ending along with character development. Roger Ebert says it well: ""KANDAHAR does not provide deeply drawn characters, memorable dialogue or an exciting climax. Its traffic is in images..."" It is the images that stick. This was made before 9/11 to show the persecution of women in Afghanistan. It is partially based on a true story involving Nelofer Pazira (Nafas), an Afghan-born Canadian journalist. In the film she has received a letter from her sister who was left behind when the family evacuated Russian-controlled Afghanistan. Her sister, now living under the rule of the Taliban, no longer wants to go on living and has given a date, the lunar eclipse, when she will commit suicide. The letter was delayed in getting to Nafas and she has arrived at the Iranian-Afghan border with only three days until the eclipse. As a woman, she is not free to travel alone into Afghanistan. She must arrange for some male assistance. The rest of the film is about her journey to find her sister. Along the way she meets a Black American disguised as an Afghan medical doctor, a Red Cross camp helping land mine victims who have lost legs. The image of the doctor (he doesn't know she is from Canada initially) asking questions of Nafas thru a third party and being separated by a sheet with a hole to examine her ears, eyes and mouth would be humorous, if not true. A Red Cross helicopter makes a 'leg drop', parachuting artificial legs to the camp below and we are overwhelmed by the image of several dozen amputees with crutches literally racing each other to get a pair of legs. The image of a her young male guide (10-12 years old) pulling a ring off a skeleton in the desert and trying to sell it to her is wrenching. Once again, we are struck by the incredible cruelty that the human race is capable of inflicting on one another, simply because of race or gender. You will probably not remember the plot but you will remember the images, images the reinforce the knowledge that there is both good and evil in this world and we must counter evil wherever we find it. A sobering film.

1832299,2,B000089RTN,"Kandahar is a film that I've been wanting to see for years.  It became a ""de rigueur"" staple of the art-house cinema circuit following 9/11.  I remember the long lines at the Museum of Fine Arts here in Houston, when the film was screened.

Obviously, this film has its fans, as evidenced by the glowing reviews on Amazon.  I personally found it to be a sham.  For starters, it is filmed documentary-style, but the plot is heavily scripted.  I'm not saying this concept is flawed; it works in The Story of the Weeping Camel.  But, in a film that deals with such serious topics as famine and land mines, it feels wholly out of place.  Also, the English-language dialogue suffers from flat delivery.  The protagonist seems phony; every potentially poignant moment is ruined by her deadpan method of speaking.

Visually, the film is stunning at times, especially when you see the wedding party march in the desert.  The sea of burqas in contrasting colors (such as emerald, black, ochre yellow, peach, white, purple, etc.) is absolutely stunning.  But the quality of the cinematography is not enough to rescue the flawed direction.

I imagine that the throngs of curious people who clamored to see the film left the cinema somewhat disappointed.  I know I did, watching it on DVD.",1183507200,3,1277,4.798165137614679

1832302,5,B000089RTN,"A woman sets out to rescue her sister in the Afghan city of Kandahar and along the way meets the displaced persons of war, the refugees, the starving, and the walking wounded. The film focuses in particular on the women and children forced to survive under hostile conditions. Their marginal existence in the desert sands on the border of Iran and Afghanistan reflects their status within the Taliban-ruled country from which they live in exile. Even more dramatically, the film explores the plight of those who have lost limbs from land mines.

Particularly informative is the commentary by actress Nelofer Pazira that is included on the DVD. Her comments reveal in eloquent detail not only the making of the movie (shot where it takes place) but the rationale behind the creative choices made, often on the fly, as the film crew worked under difficult and dangerous conditions. While western news coverage continues to focus on the military and political aspects of warfare in the Middle East, ""Kandahar"" does much to reveal the devastating impact on noncombatants.

1832303,3,B000089RTN,"As I was watching the film I had the impression that it was a documentary, and that a hidden camera was being used to capture real people.  There were times when I wondered where the hidden camera was, and who was holding it.

The story is about a woman born in Afghanistan who escaped to Canada and became a journalist.  She is returning to Afghanistan to try to rescue her sister, who told her that she plans to kill herself soon.

As I watched the film, as I watched the oppressed women with their faces completely covered in their burkas, as I watched the little children learning the dogma of their religion, which is all about killing infidels, I had no sympathy for the Afghan culture.  Afghans, and Middle Eastern Muslims in general, come off as brainwashed and ignorant savages.

One major character in the film is an American black man who impersonates a Muslim doctor and dispenses medical advice and food to the people.  He wears a false beard.  As he was counseling the Canadian journalist for her stomach problems, I was struck by the situation of two pretenders in a foreign land.  Since the film is not a documentary, but a scripted story, I find the characters to be unbelievable as presented.

The main impression I take away from this film is that the Arab people are dangerous, lying, ignorant savages.  Is that what the director and writer had in mind?  Is that the impression they were trying to convey?

I'm not totally clear on how this film ends.  Is the journalist now a captive in Afghanistan?  Can she get out?  Is she a captive in the sense that she can't get back to Canada and must live a life of oppression in her native land?  Is she going to be imprisoned literally?  We don't really have closure and clarity here.

Religion is a dangerous thing, isn't it.  They get you when you're young, they fill your baby brain with lies and garbage, and it stays with you into adulthood.  Religion controls you like a puppetmaster.  It's a damn shame that anyone believes this nonsense in the first place.  I wish the search for God and truth were carried on by more godly and more honest people.

The main products of religion today are bigotry, war, burkas, and barring of medical research in America.  What a pile of trash.  What a bunch of yahoos the human race is.  God is slandered everywhere you turn.",1125964800,8,2331,4.540865384615385
1832304,4,B000089RTN,"""Kandahar"" is a collection of slightly fictionalized vignettes of Afghan life in the 1990s, loosely grouped together in a putative dramatic plot.  The ""plot,"" such as it is, has to do with a woman who had been born in Afghanistan, and had escaped to Canada some years previously.  For reasons of her own, she seeks to make her way to Kandahar, in Afghanistan, beginning from one of the refugee camps on the Afghan border with Iran.  On the way, she meets with several normal, regular, ordinary Afghan people, and learns about their normal, regular, everyday Afghan horrendous lives.  The reason to see this film is to see the people she meets.

The plot is not very thoroughly developed, but that really doesn't matter, in my opinion.  It seems to me that far too many reviewers here are focusing on the wrong things.  In the commentary track, leading actress Nelofer Pazira talks about how she and the director chose to include various scenes, while filming, as they met various refugees in the camps.  They simply couldn't say no, to the opportunity of including these people's waking nightmares in the film.  The scenery is beautiful, in a stark way, and the plot is barely enough to keep a viewer dramatically involved, but the point is to learn about life in today's Afghanistan.

Disease, drought, ubiquitous old land mines, staggering poverty, and, of course, radical Islamic fundamentalism, collude to make Taliban-era Afghanistan an absolutely horrendous environment.  Several scenes are likely to lodge in your memory for some time, such as the young boy stealing a ring from a skeleton; the relief airplane parachuting prosthetic legs through the sky, toward a camp; the madrasas school scenes, where young boys learn to hate and kill; and the ""doctor"" who is prohibited by Islamic law from closely examining his female patients.

While viewing this, I personally found it helpful to keep all the various horrors organized, by paying attention to who Nafas' guide is, at any given moment.  She is guided by an old Afghan refugee, whose (fourth) wife she pretends to be; a student expelled from a militaristic, Muslim madrasa; an African-American ""doctor""; and a one-handed former thief.  Each guide raises various issues for Nafas.  If you try to sort out what is happening in terms of which guide Nafas is with, it can really help you out quite a bit.  I hope that you do this.

Some people reading this review may have noticed that I have put the word ""doctor"" in quotes, twice.  This is because the ""doctor"" character in the film, based on a real person, is simply a regular, fairly well-educated man from the United States.  He has no actual medical training, but even an average guy on the street in the USA knows vastly more than illiterate Afghan refugees.  He is able to make a difference, and even save lives, simply by dispensing what we would consider to be common sense advise, e.g., don't drink polluted water; dress wounds with clean bandages, etc.

If you find the ""doctor"" character to be in any way inspiring, (as I do), then you may wish to think about emulating him, without even standing up from your computer screen.  Three excellent ways that you can find ways to do this are by googling any of the following phrases: 1.) Initiative to Educate Afghan Women, 2.) Cameo Landmine Clearance, or 3.) Doctors Without Borders.

The Taliban is gone, but the socio-cultural matrix which gave rise to its existence still flourishes in Afghanistan.  It will take a lot more than a few years to heal that wounded country.  If you would like to continue to educate yourself about that area, I recommend that you also look for the DVDs called ""Panj E Asr,"" ""Osama,"" and, for a little variety, ""Marooned in Iraq.""",1122854400,10,3731,4.828616352201258

1832306,4,B000089RTN,"I love middle eastern films. So count on me to rarely give a low rating. Most of them are worth the rating.
This movie is about a woman who tries to save her sister before the next eclipse- which is coming very soon. It speaks about her travels through Iran to Afganistan. And believe me she has many trials, but someone always helped her. I am not going to share too much about this movie because I feel it will give it away, but I would recommend the DVD version and NOT the VHS. Why?
There is also autobiogrpahy of the director of this movie who is also the lead actress. It explains why she made this movie in the first place.
However the reason why I give this movie 4 stars and not 5, because I expected a little more. Although, she shows how women must be covered head to toe and there's a scene that shows of a mother who cannot work and is in much grief because of the rules- this is really all we get from what's going on inside of  Afganistan.  So with that, I am a little disappointed
However the film is beautiful in all respect and I would recommend anyone to see it.",1089417600,8,1081,4.142857142857143
1832307,2,B000089RTN,"""Kandahar"" tries to showcase Afghanistan`s current scenario, particularly woman`s condition and the tight control of that country`s system. While it suceeds at presenting some memorable and poignant scenes and realities, it ends up failing to captivate the viewer into the story of the protagonist.
The central plot is about a canadian young woman who travels to Afghanistan in order to rescue her sister from Kandahar. As her journey gets along, the viewer is presented to some peculiar and remarkable situations in a documentary-style way. This semi-documentary-feel is useful at parts, yet it somehow manages to keep the viewer distant from the movie`s characters (who don`t seem all that gripping or interesting, since they never develop much).
The acting is wildly uneven and the direction is competent, but relies more in the exotic natural landscapes than in director`s Mohsen Makhmalbaf camera tricks. The pacing is also inconsistent, delivering some slow and dull moments that lead to nowhere. And, yes, the ending could have been more compelling too.
Overall, ""Kandahar"" is a mildly interesting film, relying more on its relevant subject matter than in the plot`s disjointed execution and flow.
An important effort worth watching, still average as a movie.",1080864000,5,1266,5.398989898989899
7980864,4,B000089RTN,"This 2001 film by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf was inspired by the real-life story of an Afghan refugee, Nelofer Pazira, a Canadian journalist who unsuccessfully attempted to return to Afghanistan to help a depressed friend considering suicide as a result of Talibanic oppression.  Somewhat unnoticed when it was first released, the film shot to fame after the 911 terrorist attacks caused a global focus on Afghanistan, with even George Bush recommending that Americans watch it.

In the film, Nelofer Pazira herself takes on an acting role to play a character called Nafas, on a similar mission to assist her suicidal sister in Kahdahar, Afghanistan.  Cloaked in her burka, she begins a desperate journey that includes encounters with robbers and victims of war.

The DVD includes a featurette ""Lifting the Veil"" with interviews with Pazira about the making of the film and its vision, and also an eloquent and insightful commentary track by Pazira in which she shares her experiences in making the film and what it seeks to portray.  These are helpful in explaining the background of the film, and in identifying the key issues that Pazira wanted to convey about Afghanistan, including its struggles with warfare and drought, land-mines and hunger, and especially the repression of women under the Taliban, as symbolized by the burka, and the need for education to give hope and improvement.

None of the actors in the film are professionally trained, and many of the Afghans and Iranians featured are locals that agreed to take part in the project.  While the film's narrative seems somewhat disconnected in places, and the ending is ambiguous, this is an award-winning and much lauded film that accomplishes its goal in telling some of the real stories about Aghanistan and the plight of its people.  These stories are important for the rest of the world to hear, in order to understand and sympathize with Afghans, who despite their differences share with us a common humanity.  - GODLY GADFLY",1485129600,,2005,5.088414634146342

7980868,2,B000089RTN,"I rented this film from my local library based on my interest in middle eastern affairs, and the realities of life for women under Islamic rule.  Encouraged by the rave reviews and awards plastered across the packaging, and by the fact that everything about it made it seem like a documentary, I took the chance and signed it out.

Perhaps it was in part a case of dashed expectations, but as I began watching, my heart sank.  This was most definitely not a documentary, but rather a very scripted film.  Conversations are predictable, and I've frankly seen better, more emotive and convincing acting in high school productions.  The lead actress spoke in an uninspired deadpan, her actions as a defiant woman in a repressive environment were wholly predictable and almost humorous in the way they were enacted.  As mentioned by previous reviewers, a real documentary would serve the subject much better.  The third rate script and acting only detract from seriousness of the issues being addressed, and simplify the complex reality on the ground.

So why all the accolades?  I grappled with this question after the film, feeling totally dumb-founded and at a loss to reconcile what I saw with the reviews it received.  Perhaps critics decided this was a timely exploration of a difficult subject, and gave it an A for effort.  Perhaps as a another reviewer insists, western critics whole-heartedly embraced the film as an expression of Orientalism and a reflection of western perceptions of the middle east.  Perhaps legitimate and honest critique of the film based on content and filmic qualities would require a degree of honesty seriously missing from most media coverage of middle eastern affairs.  And finally, perhaps western critics simply did not have the nerve to level their honest criticism against a film that purports to be a revealing and progressive take on the touchy subject of life for women in the middle east.",1306627200,,1930,4.99375

7980870,3,B000089RTN,"Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film KANDAHAR was shot a couple of years before the US invasion of Afghanistan and documents the appalling state of the country in the aftermath of the Russian invasion, subsequent civil war and the rise of Taliban. The film opens on the Iran-Afghan border, where we meet Nafas (Nelofer Pazira), an Afghan refugee in Canada. Nafas is drawn back to her homeland after receiving a letter from her sister, who didn't make it out of this failed state and plans to kill herself at the last solar eclipse of the 20th century. Nafas has only two days to reach her sister and convince her that life is worth living, but the poverty and desperation of Afghanistan raises up several obstacles.

The strong point of KANDAHAR, what makes this film worth seeing, is the emotional force of its depiction of Afghanistan. There are outdoor shots here that will haunt you for long afterward: a group of amputees racing each other on their crutches to seize a pair of artificial legs that the Red Cross parachuted in; a wedding procession consisting of women who sing joyfully as they walk over desert sands, visible only as burkas of every colour. This is certainly a hell on Earth that needed international intervention on a scale larger than idealistic but powerless charity workers, so I don't rue the US invasion, though I am angry that the occupation has been handled with so little regard so the people we were supposedly there to liberate.

In spite of the memorable nature of KANDAHAR, however, it's not very good according to some qualities one normally judges a film by. The acting by the main roles is godawful, with Nafas, the American doctor and the Australian nurse delivering their lines as if they recall them only with effort, or are reading them off cue cards. The plot, that is, the personal drama of the protagonist as opposed to the saga of Afghanistan's pain, is also weak. Storytelling seems to take a back seat to a didactic purpose. So I'm put in the awkward position of recommending this film to everyone as a must-see, but unable to award it more than three stars.",1290643200,4,2094,4.734246575342466
7980871,5,B000089RTN,"Winner of a Jury Prize at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, Kandahar is an epic tale of hope and courage, inspired by the true story of a woman's attempt to enter Afghanistan.  Nafas, an Afghan-born Canadian journalist, returns to her homeland in a desperate attempt to reach her sister.  Clothed in a traditional head-to-toe burka, and posing as a subservient wife, Nafas' odyssey takes her across a dramatic desert landscape, where she encounters overwhelmed Red Cross workers, hordes of land-mine victims and finally a wedding procession that brings her within eyeshot of Kandahar.

CAC's Comments:  This film allows the audience to not only follow Nafas on her voyage but be a part of her emotional journey through Afghanistan.  This film demonstrates a perfect example of a traditional Middle Eastern wedding march which is still common and quite popular today.  Linguistically, you will hear everything from basic grammar all the way to advanced Arabic and Farsi spoken throughout this film.

7980872,3,B000089RTN,"The film's great success with audiences was in part due to the timing of its release, at a moment when Afghanistan had been catapulted into the headlines by the activities of the Taliban and the attacks of September 11, 2001...

But the motion picture, directed by one of Iran's most prominent film artists, is much more than a story pulled out from the headlines... It stars Nelofer Pazira, a female journalist, based in Canada, playing Nafas, who is trying to get into Afghanistan to reach her sister who lives in Kandahar... Nafas's sister is threatening suicide because of the intolerable oppression of women by the Taliban...

In the course of her long and dangerous journey, Nafas encounters a mixed array of Afghan people, many of them refugees... An old man agrees to take her into the country disguised as his fourth wife... Later she acquires a young boy, Khak (Sadou Teymouri), as her guide after he has been expelled from a religious school... On the way she meets Tabib Sahid, an African-American who had come to fight the Soviets but who is now practicing medicine...

""Kandahar"" mixes documentary authenticity with extraordinary moments of visual strangeness ad beauty... The Burka is an ever-present symbol of women's subjugation, yet underneath women wear varnished nails and lipstick, and their brightly-colored robes affirm their individuality... The film placed the suffering of the Afghan people, particularly the women, on an international stage...",1234224000,,1470,5.194092827004219
7980873,3,B000089RTN,"This film was a quietly disturbing take on one woman's experience while on a determined trek across the stark deserts of Afghanistan to come to the aid of her suffering sister in Kandahar. Nafas shows a melancholy courage in her quest; she is determined to find her sister and must subject herself to the dangers of bandits and checkpoints where women are body searched and otherwise humiliated. Along the way we are shown boys being trained to be mullahs; this scene is very effective in portraying the brainwashing techniques used on boys who must learn and recite prayers as well as hold up a Russian machine gun and explain it's purpose. When one boy is expelled for improper recital, he must do what he can to make money, thus he agrees to escort Nafas to Kandahar after she is abandoned by her first escorts. He is aggressive and desperate; the boy who played this part was one of the better actors in the movie. And so it goes on - Nafas is passed from escort to escort due to the dangers and suspicions of others.
The actress portraying Nafas is beautiful; she need not have said a word to convey the pain and sorrow of her plight, because her eyes are so expressive. Her speaking parts in English sounded a bit stiff and I missed some of what she said because her voice was so low.
All said, this is a haunting film which I've added to my repertoire of books and movies about Afghanistan. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to further his/her exploration of the devastating results of Taliban rule.",1227398400,,1513,4.525547445255475
