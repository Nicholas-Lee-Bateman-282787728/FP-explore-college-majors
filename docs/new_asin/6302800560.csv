515781,5,6302800560,"Water-Melon Man is a classic film starring Godfrey Cambridge, a white man who has a wife wife and white children until overnight he turns into a black man who is asked to leave by his wife and rejected by their children. He also is treated differently by his fellow employees and his employer who offers him a token job selling to black customers. He slowly goes through adjustment as a black man in an America transforming to learning to accepting changes in society after the passage of the Civil Rights Bill. Only Godfrey Cambridge could make the transformation believable. He was born in 1933 and died in 1976, around age 43.

This movie touches on the conditions of privilege and disempowerment.

There are multiple classic lines and scenes from this movie that you will never forget having watched it.",1398124800,3,444,4.666666666666667
515907,4,6302800560,The unfortunate thing is that this film is as relevant today as when it was made in 1970. Van Peebles have us question ourselves and ask what will happen to white people if they turned black. Godfrey Cambridge gives one of his best performances in this film.

""Put yourself in their place"" gets taken literally in this movie, however.. The movie is also very funny, which is fine. Serious matters don't require solemnity. Comedy is often better. There are some flaws, but they are easily overlooked. It was and is quite what I expected.",1392595200,2,471,4.8875
515909,3,6302800560,First saw this movie as a teenager. Enjoyed it then and again now! Excellent comedic commentary on racism in America. I love Godfrey Cambrige's portrayal in both the white and black roles. I'd recommend this movie to a friend.,1389571200,,226,4.82051282051282
515910,3,6302800560,I think I liked it more in the 70's.  I found the background music annoying as it was as loud as the actors when they were speaking.  Very funny concept though.,1379894400,,160,4.129032258064516

I had forgotten about it until late one night, around 2:00 in the morning, it came on the television. I watched it again and couldn't stop laughing. I was afraid I would wake up my neighbors laughing so loud. Even when the movie was over I would think of a scene and start laughing till tears came down my cheeks. I am going to buy another copy for myself and my daughter. She loves comedy and she will really enjoy this one. If you like comedy, buy this. You sure won't be disappointed.",1375401600,,585,4.140350877192983
515966,5,6302800560,"I just saw ""Watermelon Man"" on TV and loved it! I have never heard of this wonderful dramedy before and am so happy that I decided to stop and watch it while channel surfing through some digital channels. This movie directed by the father of actor Mario Van Peebles is truly ahead of its time. It has a great screenplay by Herman Raucher wrote the classics: ""Sweet November"" (the 1968 version), ""The Great Santini,"" and ""The Summer of '42.""  It's well acted, funny, smart, and thought provoking.

It's the story of a rude, crude bigot who has a good job selling life insurance, a nice wife and two loving children, and a lovely home. He picks of black people all day and laughs about it. His wife, who is a liberal, is disgusted with his comments and treatment of black people. One night he wakes up to find that he has turned black. His life, family, and neighborhood are turned upside down.

The story is smarter than today's movies. It would be great to see a well done remake as it is dated in some ways. This is an important film and I wish it would air on Turner Classic movies. It's amazing how much things have NOT changed for the better as far as racism in the U.S. since 1970 when ""Watermelon Man"" was released.",1375315200,,1221,4.393805309734513
515967,5,6302800560,"This is the story of a white man who, suddenly one day, wakes up as a black man. Great humor, but also gives us all a life lesson. First and foremost we are all equal!",1373846400,,167,3.8
515968,4,6302800560,"""Watermelon Man"" is Melvin Van Peebles' 1970 comedic satire about the state of race relations in America. While progress has been made since this film was made, the film still is relevant today if you can look past the horrible styles and occasionally over the top dialogue and lingo. Godfrey Cambridge stars as Jeff Gerber, an obnoxious white insurance salesman married to a liberal wife (Estelle Parsons) living the American dream. These two were made for their parts and pull them off perfectly, as does Howard Caine, who plays Jeff's prickly boss. You likely know Caine best from his role as Major Wolfgang Hochstetter on ""Hogan's Heroes."" This was done in the middle of ""Hogan's"" run, and the roles are not dissimilar.

The film starts as a typical comedy of the era, and frankly is not terribly compelling until the race change scene, after which the social satire wins out (mostly) over overt comedy (occasionally odd music and title cards notwithstanding.) After Jeff's overnight race change, his wife discovers she's a liberal in name only (stopping to make him a dinner of fried chicken and watermelon in the film's least politically correct scene) and their marriage suffers, though Jeff has ultimate command of his destiny in negotiating shrew financial deals (particularly his home sale.)

While the character of Jeff begins the film as a totally unsympathetic protagonist, as his life becomes more difficult it becomes easier and easier to sympathize with his plight, and he eventually wins the audience over. From accounts I have read, Van Peebles really had to fight for the conclusion with the studio, but he eventually won and the film is much better for him having realized his artistic vision. While ""Watermelon Man"" is not a perfect movie, has some occasionally grating moments (especially some occasional pre-change overacting from Cambridge,) and definitely isn't for everyone, the historical value and era-specific social commentary make this interesting viewing.",1364947200,5,1987,5.20625
515969,5,6302800560,I seen this movie for the first time in the late 90s and thought it was so hilarious! The characters are entertaining and engaging in this comedy about racism. It could be seen as offensive by some but I found I could not stop laughing.,1358380800,,236,4.266666666666667

516024,5,6302800560,"This is a classic film by director Melvin Van Pebbles, starring the late Godfrey Cambridge. Cambridge was a hilarious stand-up comedian who turned to acting.

Things get darker as Cambridge's character Jeff gets darker (pun intended). There are many lessons for society--much needed lessons for the 70s. The points made here are profound entertainment.",1349740800,2,489,4.975609756097561

A white man wakes up one morning and discovers he's turned into a black man overnight. Of course he is suddenly treated differently at home and work as he tries to scrubb off his color. He's accused of theft and refused admission to certain places. Keep in mind he'd been making some off-color jokes about blacks. Some parts are upsetting but realistic. Who wouldn't wish they were 'back to normal' if they woke up with dark skin and kinky hair the next morning, after being a white bigot the day before?. His wife didn't want to sleep with him after almost begging him for intimacy the day before. A co-worker wanted to see if the myth was true...then cried rape when she was rejected. The films showed real situations that have probably happened. Some parts are realisic and funny and it's not a bad comedy for a film made in that time...note, for a film made during it's time.

516095,4,6302800560,"Being interested in many types of film, I saw the DVD release of Watermelon Man (1970) and it was the title that caught my eye.  Directed by African-American film pioneer Melvin Van Peebles and starring Godfrey Cambridge (The President's Analyst, Cotton Comes to Harlem) and Estelle Parsons (Bonnie and Clyde), Watermelon Man relates an interesting tale of what happens when a bigoted white man wakes one day to find his skin has since turned black.

As the film begins, we meet the Gerbers, a typical white family living in a typical white neighborhood.  There's Jeff Gerber (Cambridge), the head of the family, who make his living selling insurance, Althea Gerber (Parsons), Jeff's somewhat liberal wife, and their two children.  One evening Jeff awakes to discover he's no longer white, and believes he suffering a bad dream.  This turns out not to be the case, as Jeff retains his new skin color into the next day.  He begins to look for answers, maybe it can be washed off if he showers for a lengthy period of time, or maybe the new color of his skin is attributed to spending too much time in his tanning bed, but there appears to be no real cause for what happened.  Unable to hide from the outside world forever, Jeff ventures back into his regular routine, and soon learns that the color of his skin isn't the only thing that's changed.  He finds racist attitudes prevalent throughout his workday and home life, as now, the system of which he used to be a part of, begins to turn on him, effectively forcing him to `walk a mile in another man's shoes'.

I really enjoyed this different sort of film, as it was an unusual blend of satire and social commentary.  The writing was sharp and witty, and while this may not be a film for everyone, it does provide an interesting perspective, one that doesn't necessarily have to beat its' audience over the head (it does lay it on a little thick sometimes) with its' message.  Some of the funniest scenes developed in part to Jeff and his wife's initial reaction to his change like Jeff showering for a really, really long time, his reviewing the warranty contract on his tanning bed, and his somewhat liberal wife asking if she should hide the money and serving him fried chicken and watermelon for dinner (she may be a liberal, but she's one of those liberals who's main contact comes from what she sees on the TV).  Just think how you might act or be treated if one day you found that the color of you skin has changed, while you remain the same person on the inside.  Cambridge does a wonderful job as the main character, beginning as a slightly bigoted individual who sees how life is from the other side.  While a dislikable character in the beginning, I began to develop a sense of sympathy for him as the film progressed, not because his skin changed color, but because I felt he really began to understand the inherent differences in a system he worked in and was a part of for so long, and he understood flaws within his own character, now magnified in the attitudes and demeanor of people around him, his co-workers, family, friends, and community.  He sees his world is not a particularly nice place to live, that is if you are not of the right color.  The humor is pretty subtle, and doesn't seem to be prone to exaggeration, but more or less presented to mirror that of real life, as different forms of racism are presented, from the straight up type (the use of unpleasant racial terms and profiling by the police), to less obvious, more insidious forms in terms of accepted stereotypes and common misconceptions.  The direction was a bit weird at times, as different things are incorporated into the film, strange music, odd text, (reminded me of sort of safe psychedelia used in the Monkees television show, only not to that extent) but then the late 60's and early 70's tended to elicit this kind of experimentation, which, at the time, seemed completely new and far out, but now serves mainly to effectively date films containing such elements.  An interesting side note to the film, apparently the director received quite a bit of flak over his unwillingness to change the ending of the film.  The studio executives had wanted him to incorporate an ending in which the main character would wake up and find his original skin color had returned, and the whole affair was to be presented as if it were all a bad dream (which would have ruined the film, in my opinion).  Van Peebles resisted, and was finally able to keep his intended ending, maintaining his creative integrity and preserving the element that makes this film interesting and original.  Is it controversial?  I didn't get that feeling, although I will admit this movie probably isn't for everyone.

Presented here is a really good looking wide screen version of the film, which runs approximately just over an hour and a half.  There really aren't any special features, not even a trailer, but there is an introduction by the director, Melvin Van Peebles, which can be chosen to play over the opening credits of the film.  All in all, an interesting, fairly funny perspective that still bears relevance today, some thirty plus years after its' original release.

516097,5,6302800560,"The first time I saw this movie was back in the late 70's.  At that time I felt that every American should see this movie.  Now, over 20 years later, I still hold to that belief.  Why, because this is a classic movie that skilfully mixes a message with a great story and wonderful performances all the way around.  A movie like this would probably not get the ""green light"" from a major studio today.  Godfrey Cambridge plays Jeff Gerber, the bigoted insurance salesman living in happy seclusion in suburbia.  One night he goes to bed an average white guy, and the next day he wakes up an african american and truly a rasin in the sun.  Versions of this storyline have been utilized before (from James Whitmore in ""Black Like Me"" to that really bad C. Thomas Howell move), but none can hold a candle to the artistry of this movie.  It will make you laugh out loud while simultaneously making you think about yourself and your own values.  It will take you through the journey of one man's struggle for self acceptance, and leave you asking why eveyone else couldn't get over themselves like he had to.  On top of that, it is very clever and will drop subtle hints early in the movie that are easliy missed untill referred to later (like Jeff Gerber's full name, Jefferson Washington Gerber).  Melvin Van Peebles (yes Mario's father for the uninitiated) is fully on his game for this movie, and he coaxes superior performances out of the cast.
If you are white, watch it with a person of color and talk about it after the movie is over.  It will probably be one of the most powerful conversations you have ever had.  If you're african american, just watch the film and prepare for a great deal of identification and head shaking.  They just don't make movies like this anymore.",1023321600,11,1776,4.5266457680250785
516098,4,6302800560,"One night my friend and his brother were watching a bad movie and making fun of it. My friend Rich said that he had a funny movie called The Watermellon Man. I told him to get it without knowing anything about it. I soon relized that this was a very good film. The movie is directed by Melvin Van Peeples and it stars Godfrey Cambridge as Jeff Gerber a average white man who does not understand anything about minorities except they are good fodder for his bad jokes. Gerber races the bus everyday to save some money, grabs his assistant at office and generally is oblivious to the rest of the world. He is not a bad man just ignorant. One night Gerber awakes to find that he has become a black man. After scrubbing for hours, and attacking the delivery man of his new tanning lamp he accept's the fact and goes out of the house. Now he deals with all the bigotry that he himself acted with. There are some really funny parts to this film, like when his kids ask him if he is going to race the bus and he yells ""Never bring up the race issue agian."" By the end of the movie you have realized that he will not be turned back and is a black man forever. You also see how different he is treated one day to the next. As a white man he is left alone by the police and never questioned about his ethecs. As a black man he finds it different. The end can be a little confusing but is can be forgiven for giving us a great movie. I would like to see this remade someday.",1017446400,10,1463,4.083333333333333

516100,2,6302800560,"I say this review is most important of all, because the other reviews seem to all be written by whites.  I am an African-American male, the ""indirect"" subject of the movie.  However, I am not at all  diminshing the movie reviewing acumen of the whites that responded to this  film, it is just that I have a unique perspective.  With that being said,  basically I was having one of my bouts with insomnia and early this morning  say, 2:30 am I see this horrible movie on ABC, and the worst part of it all  was that it was sponsored under the so-called ""African Heritage  Network"".  If this saturnine piece of cinematic trash is our  ""Heritage"", then I fear for the legacy we leave for the future.  I have seen nothing but stereotypes and barbs at African Americans. This  movie makes a weak attempt at social commentary, satire, and  insightfulness, but only mananges to procure buffoonery.  Cambridge is  unfortunately used by Peebles as a minstrel for a very tragic style of  self-effacing humor that has plagued our actors and comedians for  generations.  It is sad to see so many references to the vile percieved  charachter attributes that African-Americans suffer with, however, the  movie does do an excellent job of portraying the typical  white psyche and  arrogant, racist attitudes.  I was absolutely sickened by this movie, and  wonder where it got the money to be produced.  When is someone going to  peel back the layers and stop hiding behind immaterial fluff, and pathetic  sight gags.  When will whites take ownership for the wrongdoings to  virtually every race on the planet, both in the past and the future.  True  amicable relations between races, especially black and white will not  happen until whites can look beyond how attractive they think they are and  all the material possesions that have been afforded to them due to hundreds  of years of cruelties, and face the ""person"" underneath. I am 22  years old now, I wonder if this sort of introspection will happen in a  large scale in my lifetime. Time will tell.

516101,5,6302800560,"Despite the lunatic rantings of the Klan member 5 posts down from mine (is this really the place for such reactionary grandstanding?) I heartily recommend this movie.  Made in a time when you could make a  ""different"" sort of movie, this one just radiates with style,  creativity, social commentary, satire, and a tremendously gifted  performance from the lead character.  Yes, this movie is very ""over  the top,"" from the acting to the story, to the cinematography, to the  lighting, to the crashing piano accompaniment, and THAT'S what makes it so  monumental.  It isn't like every other movie out there, it's got the unique  qualities that make mankind who we are.  Sure, the story isn't fully  cohesive, and it tends toward the silly, but that's part of the point of  the film.  It's like a roller-coaster ride in someone else's shoes.  Just  hold on and see where it takes you.  Underneath the readily apparent light  humor, It's really quite an intelligent film that represents the past, the  present, and the future of how we all think about things.
