8737956,5,B01729J1G0,"One of my all time favorite shows! I got seasons 1-4 at Walmart and waited to see if they would ever carry any future seasons. NOT! But I fell back on the one place I can always trust to have what I want, Amazon and of course they have every episode, either as a whole or season by season. Since I already have the first four I am ordering the rest of them two seasons at a time. What it being Christmas and all I am holding down on expenses for myself! After the first of the year I'm gonna finish up rounding out my X-Files collection and order the last three seasons of MASH. Thanks to Amazon I'm building up a nice collection of the greatest TV shows of all time. Johnny Carson, Andy Griffith, MacGyver, WKRP, Carol Burnett, etc,., Direct TV is nice, but having what you want, when you want it can't be beat!",1512432000,,812,4.178343949044586
