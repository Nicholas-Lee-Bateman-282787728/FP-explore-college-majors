7945971,4,B00005MM7T,"I though this flick has all the foot print of an amazing old school kung fu, but fell some what short,,not much!!  Don't get me wrong the fight scenes are amazing, especally using the crippled style, four crippled men.  The choreography very good, the picture quality surprizingly good. After watching this flick the first time,,,I was compelled to watch it again a second time around!!! I would recommend this movie to all the old school kung fu lovers out here,,,you will not be dissapointed.  I gave this flick a 4 stars for the good efforts, as it was directed by a fairly new/ unknown director Hwa Yan!!",1149552000,,608,4.663551401869159
7945972,4,B00005MM7T,"4 men all punished by the same man join forces and learn the crippled fighting style in order to combat his devils palm.  Not the most outstanding kung fu cast, but they do more then enough to keep you interested.  I liked this film alot.  Some great humor, and some great fights, what else do you need?",1020816000,,303,4.280701754385965
