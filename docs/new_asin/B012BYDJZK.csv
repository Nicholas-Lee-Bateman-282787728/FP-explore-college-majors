7346536,5,B012BYDJZK,"After reading reviews about packaging woes on the Friday the 13th Bluray set, I decided to put mine together buying the newly released double feature blurays. I still believe that was the way to go, however Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X are currently only available on Bluray in the complete set. This inexpensive double feature DVD will allow me to complete my collection until those 2 titles will hopefully be available on bluray ala cart. I have no qualms with the quality of this double feature DVD in terms of audio or video.",1447632000,5,531,4.6
7346537,1,B012BYDJZK,"Do NOT buy this! Ask nearly any Friday the 13th fan and they'll tell you these are the two worst ones! If you want a double feature, try the set with one and two on it or three and four on it.",1446940800,,192,3.5952380952380953
7346538,3,B012BYDJZK,Okay if you like the Jason movies and enjoy far fetched on reviving dead characters. The Jason X costume is pretty amazing.,1518134400,,123,4.636363636363637

7346544,1,B012BYDJZK,They're making too many of these different style boxes and need to stop i don't think this is worth buying either of the films this set and people who want the filns just need to buy the movies separately instead of spending a ton of money.,1510790400,,240,4.239130434782608
7346545,1,B012BYDJZK,Screwd my order up didn't make it right,1508544000,,39,4.0
7346546,5,B012BYDJZK,"To start, I do want to note that this set does indeed contain both the theatrical and the extended, unrated cut of ""Jason Goes to Hell"" despite the Amazon description indicating otherwise.  To my knowledge, no other reviews have made this clear.  And this is a big selling point, as the unrated, uncut version of the film has some fantastic additional effects that make it well-worth seeing out for fans.  It's also worth noting as for some bizarre reason, the stand-alone DVD release of the unrated edition goes for a laughably inflated price used from third-party sellers.  So please...  just grab this and don't waste your time on those used copies.  This is the same exact disc, PLUS ""Jason X"" to boot!

Something strange about the ""Friday the 13th"" film series is that despite being one of the most popular and recognized slasher-film series of all time... they've done a remarkably terrible job at releasing boxed sets and collections for the series. Sure, there was a gorgeous Blu-Ray boxed-set collection released a few years back...  but it went out of print almost instantly after becoming available and now sells for hundreds of dollars used.  Sure, they just released a new DVD boxed set of the first eight films...  but it's on the inferior standard-definition format, so sound and image quality is stuck in the last century.  Sure, there are double-pack Blu-Ray sets available that have the films in HD like we want...  but like the complete collection boxed-set, they similarly have stopped being manufactured, and now cost many times what they originally did.

And yes, I know there's rights issues and all that jazz.  But it just seems so ludicrous that such an iconic series is almost completely unavailable in its entirety for a reasonable price in HD.  So until we get some sort of proper re-release of the franchise, many fans including myself are stuck trying to track down the films for a fair price on DVD.  And I'd say for the most part that this double-pack succeeds and is a nice way to ""complete"" the recently-released Paramount 8-Film DVD set.  It contains both ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"", plus the same assortment of special features from their previous DVD release for only about $12,  making this by and far the easiest and most affordable way to own these films.

So yeah... If you're looking for these two movies, this is a must-have.",1507248000,9,2376,4.807881773399015
7346547,5,B012BYDJZK,Super fast shipping! Product was as described! I just needed these two films to complete my Friday the 13th collection. Jason X in my opinion is a terrible movie. That's why when I seen these two together for this price had to pick up a copy.,1507248000,,242,4.282608695652174
