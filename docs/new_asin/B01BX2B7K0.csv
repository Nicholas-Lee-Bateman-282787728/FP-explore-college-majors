8751773,4,B01BX2B7K0,"Okay video quality, okay packaging. These ""part"" DVD sets for Doctor Who, on series 2 through 4 are great. Yes they are the slower 24p versions of the episodes, but they appear to have been remastered. Series 5 is where the quality tanks. The scaling leads to a very jagged picture at times. The BBC logo at the beginning of The Pandorica Opens, for example, is one of those moments where the scaling looks terrible on a computer or flat screen.

I haven't had a chance to test these on a CRT screen, as the CRT in the house died. I imagine these DVDs would look better played back on one a 4:3 CRT than a 16:9 LCD. Overall, only buy these if you are either a rabid Doctor Who fan who must have everything Doctor Who or don't own a Blu-ray player. At least the show makes the less than ideal picture quality able to be overlooked.",1475798400,2,830,4.253164556962025
8751774,5,B01BX2B7K0,"I love collecting Doctor Who Dvd's problem is the box sets get kind of expensive. I am a whovian on a budget and I love these single 7 episode releases. I have been waiting for Series 5 to get the part 1 and part 2 release and in March 2016 it happened. This July release is the final episodes of Matt Smith's first season

Episodes are
Amy's Choice
The Hungry Earth/ Cold Blood 2 Parter
Vincent and The Doctor (One of the best new doctor who episodes ever)
The Lodger (First appearance of Craig)
The Pandorica Opens/ Big Bang ( The series 5 finale)

If you want a cheaper alt to Doctor Who DVD's pic this one up",1469491200,6,612,4.177966101694915
