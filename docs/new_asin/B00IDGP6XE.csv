8641280,2,B00IDGP6XE,"As someone who teaches Sexuality and Relationship Education to individuals with Asperger's/ASD I really, really wanted to like this video.  Unfortunately it is not designed with ASD learners in mind nor is much of the information put into a relevant context.  The video consists of a ""talking head"" lecturing at the camera.  The cutaway visuals are mainly still camera shots.  To be perfectly honest I thought this video was 20+ years old until I realized it wasn't.

The content rushes through puberty and goes so far as ""no means no"".  The reality is that most boys/young men with ASD do not have a normative trajectory when it comes to dating, relationships and sex so much of this information is completely out of their realm.

I do appreciate the effort that was put into this video however it would never hold the attention nor would it be relevant to most guys on the spectrum because it lacks so much context.",1452729600,5,917,4.729559748427673
8641281,4,B00IDGP6XE,"We found this Dvd helpful and a good addition to any school provided sex education curriculum. It covers hygiene, personal space, and issues relevant to boys on the spectrum in terms of respecting their partner's space, no means no, and not engaging in ""stalking"" like behavior such as making multiple phone calls to one's potential partner within the same hour or day. Also makes a point for being up front about one's autism. All topics are covered in a factual way suitable for pre teens. The only thing missing in the video is a frank talk about how to clean up and do hygiene following masturbation. This topic is treating as something that is a private act but very little else is said about it.",1424822400,,701,4.616
8641282,1,B00IDGP6XE,The video is something you would watch in a class room ECT...very monotone.my kids were not very engaged. I assumed that it would be more animated and or visual considering children on the spectrum are visual beings.,1420848000,,216,4.864864864864865
