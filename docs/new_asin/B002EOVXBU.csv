8367871,5,B002EOVXBU,Amazing Movie about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The film is shot almost in real time and besides being a thriller also is a bit of a slice of life of people in a small rural village in Columbia.,1498176000,,214,4.512820512820513
8367872,5,B002EOVXBU,"PVC 1 is a Master Piece for many reasons. This Movie intended a different narrative out of real life story that happened in Colombia. it all makes sense because in an event like this one nothing seems real, nothing rolls normal, and all that is portraited in the narrative that the director chose.",1486425600,,297,4.622641509433962
8367873,2,B002EOVXBU,"The few reviews I've read of this movie were very positive and focused on the fact that it consisted of (or seemed to consist of) one long tracking shot. It looked as though it were shot on film as opposed to video but I know of no 85 minute rolls of film, and the director is listed as the editor, and there is no need for an editor if there is no editing.  So somewhere there must have been some very clever and subtle editing going on.

That being said, this isn't a very good movie. A farming family is set upon by bad guys demanding large sums of cash. The farmer says they don't have it so said bad guys proceed to put a PVC collar, containing a bomb, around the wife's neck and say they'll be back for the cash in some certain amount of time. The farmer, wife and daughter proceed to call the officials and go to meet them to get the bomb diffused.

Though this is a clever exercise it is unnecessary and the story could have been handled better using more conventional film making methods. The action and dialogue are sparse and there seemed to be too many times where the camera would pull away from the action only to return again. It felt as though they were stretching the clock. There was one scene where time was taken out so the victim could relieve herself. All this did was pad the clock. And though there were a couple of tense moments, much more tension could have been created with real editing.

The ending was also pretty terrible. I'm not arguing what happens there, merely the way in which it was handled. I got a decent enough taste for the lead characters but it made me want to know more. All it did was drive home the point that this would have been better with a more traditional approach.",1311033600,,1718,4.276923076923077
