8327057,5,B001NH4CGM,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  Many of the clips came from trailers, but there was a good developmental story line.  The images were clean; the sound solid.  There were a number of acters and others from the time period providing brief interviews.  There was material from a number of studios.  Many of the film clips I had never seen before.  I wish many things -- longer film clips, longer interviews, etc, but all in all this was a reasonable effort.",1335744000,,450,4.5625
