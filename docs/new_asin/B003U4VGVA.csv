8405652,4,B003U4VGVA,"The plot is weird and meandering, but in a good way, I think.  The movie delves into confusing, arcane horrors... how could that be anything but weird?  I can't wait to see what Lokean Productions comes up with next.",1380585600,,216,4.512820512820513
8405653,2,B003U4VGVA,"As confusing as the graphics depict on the cover of the DVD. Awfully meandering and bizarre. And the lead did not draw me in, so I did not care whether he figured stuff out or not. I stopped watching a third of the way through.",1365724800,,227,4.066666666666666
8405654,5,B003U4VGVA,"This is Lokean's third commercial film, and their best work so far! Continuing on the arc of Ahriman, they delve deeper into a dark, serious story, resurrecting a long-discarded genre: Suspense Horror.

Instead of going the route of most modern horrormakers, Lokean spares the blood and gore, instead keeping a lingering shadow just outside the realm of normalcy. The terror comes from discovering the unknown, instead of slathering us in the modern horror trends that rely entirely on the visual. This is more cerebral, playing at the need to know something, while also dreading what we might learn.

The performances of Brett Vanderbrook, Jessica Cameron, and John Falzone are impeccable. The editing has improved by leaps and bounds from their last film. Lokean struck gold with this one.",1282176000,2,791,5.171875
8405655,2,B003U4VGVA,"Must be a joke.

$12 for a 30 minute movie. Trust was slip of finger. Meant to put $6. Maybe $5?

Is okay movie. Thought lead actor and actress were good. Everyone else stiff. Mechanical. Script had interesting twist. Wish director or producer would have cast better. Wish could recommend seeing. But at price is at now? Avoid.",1279497600,4,327,4.620689655172414
