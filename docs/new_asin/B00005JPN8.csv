1568810,4,B00005JPN8,"There was an obscure, misbegotten movie that Gene Hackman and Liv Ullmann made back in 1974,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zandy-s-Bride/dp/6302751160/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zandy's Bride</a>, about the evolving relationship between a roughhewn rancher and his Norwegian mail-order bride. First-time director-screenwriter Ali Selim takes a similar premise in his 2006 film but adds gravitas to the situation by adding a heartbreaking theme of intolerance, a multi-generational dimension and a beautiful tableau sense to its period imagery. The result is a most unusually elegiac, unhurried film, which fluidly goes back and forth between three points in time - 1920, 1968 and 2004 - chronicling the travails of the Torvik family and their neighbors on the Minnesota prairie.

The focal character is Inge, who in 1920 is a young, vibrant German immigrant raised in Norway and sent to Minnesota to marry Olaf, a reticent Norwegian farmer. They face community resistance to their union, especially from the town's influential Lutheran minister, since WWI just ended with a palpable bitterness toward any German in their midst. In 1968, an aged Inge shares these memories with her grandson Lars upon Olaf's death, and then in 2004, upon Inge's death, a now-mature Lars must decide whether to keep the family farm or accept a lucrative offer on it. The 1920 passages hold the most interest because Selim pays meticulous attention to the details of rural life, including the harvest of an overwhelming corn crop and the enjoyment of a simple pie.

Solid performances abound with Elizabeth Reaser providing a powerfully affecting turn as Inge, a sharp contrast to the modern-day commitment-phobe she played in Maria Maggenti's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-for-Beginners/dp/B000N2H8XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini for Beginners</a>. Tim Guinee skillfully handles the more elliptical role of Olaf, although Alan Cumming and Alex Kingston steal their scenes as Olaf's animated man-child neighbor Frandsen and his fertile, grounded wife Brownie. Lois Smith makes her brief scenes count as the older Inge. David Tumblety's superb cinematography of the bucolic landscapes evokes Nstor Almendros' dazzling work in Terence Malick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Heaven/dp/079215455X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Heaven</a>. The 2007 DVD has a standard set of extras beginning with an insightful commentary track by Selim, editor James Stanger and producer Gil Bellows, along with stars Guinee and Reaser. There is a ten-minute, making-of featurette, ""Sweet Land: A Labor of Love Story"", pretty standard, as well as the original theatrical trailer. This is a most auspicious debut for Selim.",1185062400,6,2843,6.25
1568811,5,B00005JPN8,"Sweet Land is the film wrought from Will Weaver's short story, A Gravestone made of Wheat.  Sweet Land is an excellent film with a wonderful cast that nicely capture the pace, speech, and humor of the 1900s mid-western immigrant American landscape.  Tim Guinee, as Olaf, captures in single glances the many emotions of the shy, hard working and loyal Olaf.  Given the important role of silence in the film, Guinee's skill brings Olaf alive as much of the beginning of the film reveals Olaf to the audience through subtle mannerisms, facial expressions, and simple words.  Elizabeth Reaser is wonderful as well, never falling back on stereotypical behavior of ""the immigrant"" but revealing Inge to be a woman of dreams, hope, and tenacity.  This film is unlike so much of what Hollywood passes off as good film-making and as such I give it 5 stars.",1184544000,6,847,4.854166666666667
1568812,2,B00005JPN8,"Unless you like ""art-house"" films, you're going to feel like a fool for having bought this.  You have been warned.",1184457600,,114,4.7
1568813,5,B00005JPN8,"I saw this film in April 2006 at the Wisconsin Film Festival. It won the overall Audience Choice Award for the festival, a well-deserved win.

Poor Olaf. I cannot recall a more harrowing example of sexual frustration, but with a gentleness fostered by the film's humorous, playful flavor. Olaf's self-control was absolutely adorable and irresistible. Tim Guinee intensely reminded me of a younger Harrison Ford, particularly Ford's more vulnerable and innocent roles like Regarding Henry or the light-hearted moments in Witness.

If Guinee was Harrison Ford, then Elizabeth Reaser is a doppelganger for Penelope Cruz. That distinctive, almost saucy underbite distracted me in its resemblance! Although born and raised in Michigan, Reaser spoke almost no English in this film, and she had to deliver a number of frustrated tirades entirely in German. Although I am curious how German audiences would receive her performance, I was impressed. None of the German is translated. We are in the same boat as Olaf and the villagers, trying to understand Inge's intentions and personality through clues of body language, intonation, and expression.

The movie is one of imagination and memory, literally. In almost every scene, Inge's hair and make-up are flawless, and she wore one particularly traveling outfit over and over. At first, I thought this was unrealistic movie magic, but then I thought of the way the story was told. Inge, as an old woman, relates the tale of her courtship to her grandson, Lars, after giving him an old photograph of herself. That photo was taken the day she arrived to become Olaf's wife, and in it, she is beautifully made up and dressed in her best to meet her new husband. Lars, having only this one image of his youthful grandmother, creates the flashback from that starting point. Young people often find it difficult to envision elderly relatives as anything other than old, so Lars did the best he could, placing that particular Inge--well-dressed, pretty, and neatly made up--in all of his flashback imaginings. This trick of storytelling lent the entire film an extra dose of fairy tale magic.

Alan Cumming, as Olaf's vaguely pathetic and very fatherly best friend, was comedic, but he did not spoil the picture with an overdose slapstick or hijinks. However, I did find his pairing with Alex Kingston a little improbable. She seemed too solid and practical to be married to the town clown. Ned Beatty and John Heard, as the archetypal nasty banker and god-fearing minister, respectively, added to the Capra parable feel, but the real centerpiece was the chemistry between Reaser and Guinee and the magic they created for their characters. The anticipation is breath-taking. I just wanted those two to find the right time and place.

A beautiful film.",1183939200,9,2787,5.089715536105033
1568814,5,B00005JPN8,"I often see romance movies with my wife and that will be the end of it, but this movie kept me coming back, I saw it 3 times (twice by myself) in the theater and would see it again if it was still showing, its that good, I can't imagine why this movie wasn't awarded ""Best Picture"" ""Best Everything"". There is a charming innocence about this film, that makes you want to live in yesteryear, and that's coming from a guy! Now I want to own it.",1182297600,58,442,4.091954022988506
1568815,5,B00005JPN8,"This film is a must-see.  The beginning and ending perfectly frame the main part of the movie which is a flashback of Inge's and Olaf's love story.  It's set in Becker County Minnesota which is my former neck of the woods.

The movie is largely authentic, but liberties have been taken.  First, Olaf is the perfect incarnation of a Norwegian immigrant farmer.  His demeanor perfectly captures the personality and mentality of the Norwegian farmers that I knew in my youth.  His acting is absolutely stunning.  On the other hand, Inge is luminous, but her behavior is Hollywoodized--she would have been much more subdued for a woman at that time.  The Lutheran pastor too, would have been more subdued and perhaps stricter.  Other inauthenticities include the flatness of the land--Becker County is full of hills, lakes, rocks and trees.  And how can there be a movie about Norwegians that doesn't include a scene of them eating lefse?

Nevertheless, one truly accurate scene was the ground-level shot of Inge's and Olaf's boots trudging through the very black soil.  The dirt in northwestern Minnesota is exceedingly black and rich, being the former bottom of a glacial lake.  Olaf's muttering ""Uff da"" at one of Inge's outbursts and his slogan ""Banking and farming don't mix"" are ideal representations of the classic characteristics of the Norwegians that I know.

All in all, this film is charming and engaging.  It is a fabulous introduction to the microculture of Scandinavian heritage that is entrenched in the Upper Midwest, which few Americans are aware of and even fewer understand.",1177200000,15,1590,5.038314176245211
1568816,4,B00005JPN8,"Sweet Land is a movie about a mail-order bride from Germany who comes to America during the time right after WWI. Obviously, the towspeople are a little leary about having a German there so soon after the US had just finished war with them. Anyway, it follows the bride and her soon-to-be groom during their first few months together.

The story itself is great. It's completely simple, but still excellent. I truly enjoyed it. I saw this movie because it was dubbed the new 'Days of Heaven'. But other than the early 1900s farm setting, I saw few similarities. The cinematography was very well done, but still much different than Malick's film. Overall, I would say it was strong in visuals. My biggest complaint about this film was the present-time bookends. The meat of the story was a complete and beautiful film all by itself. The first 5-10 minutes and the last 5-10 minutes should have been cut. They were cliche and really did not match the tone of the rest of the film. Had those parts not been included, this movie is a 10/10.

Sweet Land is one of the best films of 2006 and you will be glad you saw it. If possible, see it with a significant other. It's a very rare 'real' love story, and well worth a viewing.",1177027200,32,1222,4.475336322869955
1568817,5,B00005JPN8,"""Sweet Land"" is the only movie I've ever watched twice at the movie theaters.  It was just as entertaining the second time I saw it.  I am of Irish descent, and when I moved to Minnesota a few years ago, I found myself surrounded by many people of Scandavian heritage.  ""Sweet Land"" allowed me to traverse back to my neighbors' cultural antecedents.  (It also gave me a greater appreciation for basic amenities like indoor plumbing.)  The movie seemed to really capture the hardscrabble existence of immigrants who risked coming to America for a better, more independent life.  It also showed the cultural sensibilities the Scandavians brought over with them.  The characters and their life stories are very memorable.  ""Sweet Land"" is truly charming movie that deserves a much wider distribution.",1173312000,60,797,5.076923076923077
1568818,5,B00005JPN8,"Ali Selim is a gifted artist and one that surely will continue to create magical films such as his masterpiece SWEET LAND in the coming years. Selim wrote the screenplay based on Will Weaver's perfect little short story 'A Gravestone Made of Wheat', found the perfect setting for his tale of the trials of immigrants entering America searching for the American Dream in the spacious grandeur of Minnesota, and selected a cast to bring life to his story that simply could not be better. This film DESERVED to be considered among the best at the time of awards.

Though the time of the story is 1920, the film opens much later in slow motion, only soft music comes from the soundtrack, yet the actors are mouthing words that make us realize we are witnessing the passing of someone important. When the characters begin to speak, the story of remembering what love and trials and experiences years ago were like, transporting us to a station house where we meet Inge (Elizabeth Reaser), a Norwegian/German girl who has come to America to marry a man she has never met, a man who will provide her with home, marriage, and a chance to start afresh. Her 'intended' is Olaf (Tim Guinee) who is shy and unsure of how to make Inge a part of his life: Inge's German background makes her suspect to the townsfolk who fear the course of Germany's power in WW I. Inge speaks no English but has been learning through a common phrase book. Olaf's friend Frandsen (a brilliant role for Alan Cumming), married to Brownie (Alex Kingston) with at least eight children already, helps Inge connect with Olaf. The intended marriage cannot take place with the minister (John Heard) because Inge can't speak English and because she is German... And there begins the trial that places Inge and Olaf in a home unmarried and fending for themselves.

Through extraordinary acts of love bestowed upon Frandsen and Brownie (threatened with eviction from their farm) Inge and Olaf gain the respect of the townspeople and gradually are appreciated for the strong couple they are. They are married, and have children, and the story proceeds to the point where it started, where the aged Inge (now played with humility, grace and style by Lois Williams) carries on the integrity of the departed Olaf and brings closure to her family's disparities through her bonding to her grandson Lars (Patrick Heusinger and later Stephen Pelinski). Both Inge and Olaf wished to be buried in the soil of their land that raised the wheat that gave them material and spiritual sustenance. And it is done.

There are numerous fine cameo roles portrayed by Ned Beatty, Paul Sand, Jodie Markell, Sage Kermes, Kirsten Frantzich, Stephen Yoakam, and Karen Landry. But the equal 'stars' of this breathtaking (and heart-taking) film are cinematographer David Tumblety and musical scoring by Thomas Lieberman and Mark Orton. The end credits are screen on the horizon of the farm with the young Inge and Olaf dancing, a touch that places Ali Selim in the ranks with the finest of filmmakers of the day. This is a brilliant, must-see film. Grady Harp, February 07",1171324800,98,3103,4.828947368421052

Too much socialist stuff mentioned in this movie. Why didn't Olaf tell the townspeople that Inge had been living in Norway, not Germany during the war?

1569748,5,B00005JPN8,"This movie was released in 2008 yet I just discovered it.  What a treasure of a movie.  It's a story of the immigrant experience and the prejudice that existed.  It's also a story of friendship and loyalty.  But at it's heart, it's a love story.  Inge, a young German woman who speaks only one or two words of English, has traveled across the world to marry a man she's never met, Olaf Torvik.
Torvik is a shy, hard working farmer who barely speaks on their first meeting.  Both characters are portrayed so skillfully that it took me a moment to realize where I'd seen those faces before.  Elizabeth Reaser plays Inge and was also Esme in the Twilight movie series.  Tim Guinee plays Olaf and has been in quite a few television series, Stargate SG-1 and Revolution, I believe.  The story is told from several different perspectives - the two young people upon their first meeting, Inge after Olaf's death and then the grandson later after Inge's death.  It is a story of the love of two people and their love of the land.  It's about the meaning of home and family.  Keep your tissues handy when you sit down to watch because believe me you'll need them but it is so worth every tear.  This is going on my list of all time favorites.",1379894400,,1233,4.426666666666667

1569754,5,B00005JPN8,"Having grown up and living in the area this was filmed in I am most certainly biased.  I know these farm houses, I know the fields to be planted and reaped, I know the hardships technology (at the time planters and reapers) meant, I know their shared use.  I know the kitchen tables where recipes are shared and smiles and laughter happen.  I know that a stranger to the community is always suspect / I know that at the time language barriers existed, the same as they do today.  I know an elegant exquisite film when I see one and this is it if you come from an immigrant family, a farm family, a family that values family ties through the generations.

1569848,1,B00005JPN8,"Hate to be Jonny rain cloud here, but honestly, I am in shock at the great reviews of this movie. One of my pet peeves about movies is when they fail to introduce all the characters correctly. I was totally confused from the very beginning. First scene they show a old woman dying, then they show an old woman living who's husband just died. Then they flashback and introduce all these new characters that you don't have a clue who they are,but just one,or what they were even there for. I knew nothing about this movie when I first watched it so it might be ok for people who were more informed. Then you have the different language issue which was only frustrating to listen to because I was waiting for someone to explain what the heck was going on. The scenery was the best part.",1370736000,3,783,4.36986301369863

1569850,5,B00005JPN8,"I've seen the film twice, and watched the commentary twice, both a few years apart.

You have to understand that this film is a memory piece, not a literal one. A poem, not a documentary. So you will see greens that were greener than they really were. Clothes that were nicer than they really wore. Director Ali Selim knew this. He said so, in his commentary.

So the way Inge wore her hair, or how pretty she was, is what Inge remembers, thinking back from 1968 to 1920; not what really was.

Harvesting corn in the day, threshing wheat (soybeans?) the next-- steam thresher or steam engine --- cutting acres of corn in one night-- this is not intended to be a farm documentary; it is intended to be a memory from 50 years hence.

Some reviewers stated that if only there had been subtitles, the film would have been better, or made more sense. No! Not at all. I do speak German. I can tell you the lack of subtitles is not an issue.

Ask yourself: Have you ever enjoyed a silent film? Or did you spend the whole time thinking ""this film would make better sense if we could hear what they were saying?"": No.

Again, this is intentional-- Director Selim wants to focus you on the nonverbal, the visual-- not the literal. And you can pick up completely from that visual context what the communication is, wenn Sie deutsch verstehen knnen, oder nicht. Ich denke, da Sie glauben, was ich meine.

This is a solid 5 stars, amazing for the low budget, on-location, 24-day shooting.

The soundtrack is wonderful. Und Sie denken mssen, was wichtig ist: A poem, not a documentary!",1368576000,,1571,4.507042253521127

1569852,5,B00005JPN8,"This movie captures perfectly the immigrant experience of the early 20th century northern plains where people from northern Europe settled in. My own Norwegian and German ancestors were from N Dakota and Minnesota respectively so this film really hits home. It illustrates how differences in customs, language, and religion divide us. But more importantly it illustrates how we can rise above the ""brainwashing"" we all get (intentionally or not). The performances here are outstanding. The shy and awkward Norwegian bachelor farmer stereotype is nailed perfectly in this film. There are unintentionally funny moments too. When the poor German girl is sitting in church the Norwegian pastor attacks her because her coffee is too black. I almost died laughing but back in the day, every little thing that made you an ""alien"" could be used against you. I found myself asking out loud ""is he serious???"". The film also shows how much power the banks had over the immigrant farmers. You realize that bankers didn't just turn horrible recently, they have ALWAYS been horrible. I am glad I own this movie.

1570013,4,B00005JPN8,"This is a good movie...from several veiwpoints.
Yes, there was propaganda that would make Jane Fonda happy.
Yes, there was some good  semi-accurate history included in the flick.
Yes, there was good acting by most everyone.
Yes, there was a good romance in there.

I grew up in the area.  I'm an old fart.  I lived a little of what the movie showed. My grandparents and parents would talk about some of what the movie talked about.  (Our Lurtheran pastor was from Norweigh; first generation.  He was not biased against any other nationality.  He did discriminate between Lutherans and Catholics, especially and others to lesser degrees.  Each denomination hated to see one of their kids marry outside their church.
Once the marriage was accomplished and a child was produced AND another church's kid married into their church...all was well and happy again.)

I watched the movie several times and have ordered here.... I chose to watch a little history, a lot of romance and some good acting.  I ignored the more liberal views and just enjoyed as mentioned.  We can fight about politics anytime... why spoil a good simple movie?

Yes, I did hate to see the pastor act the way he did but there are one or two ""bad pastor/priests out there.... look at that guy who wouldn't marry a mixed couple a few months ago.  On the other hand, I know pastor/priests who give up their lives for others in many ways. In my parent's and earlier times, many things were different than they are now. .(I will make a couple of exceptions but not here, not now...)  But, that was then and this is now.... NOW.... I still know some bigots.  I also know some progressive folks who accept and love everyone! ....UNLESS they are Christians, hunters, Conservatives, etc... And there are some really nice conservatives who love and accept a liberal PERSON inspite of their politics.

But, I think I speak too much about politics here... so;

Everyone has an axe to grind... This movie presents two or three ways of movie making:
It has something for most to enjoy.  Like the parts you like... but don't let the other views ruin an enjoyable experience.",1347062400,,2127,4.718157181571816

1570104,5,B00005JPN8,"Personally, I really liked this film. Early on it is a bit slow moving, but once it changes time frames and Elizabeth Reaser (Inge Altenberg) is involved, it really gets good. Just Inge's use of English makes it worth watching. Reaser and Tim Guinee play off well against one another. Ned Beatty is excellent in his supporting role, as is Alex Kingston. One thing that could get in the way of enjoying this film for some is that at times it seems to start becoming a bit inclined to certain social agenda, though it does in some regards present both sides. There is also a point where some people might disagree with Inge's OR the reverend's take on religion, but I think those counterbalance each other well, and should not keep anyone from watching this otherwise great movie. I found the soundtrack very pleasing as well.",1338854400,,824,4.6506849315068495
1570105,5,B00005JPN8,"All that is good takes time to grow, and then you reap the benefits as the film depicts. There is a love of the land, love that occurs in friendship, love amongst TRUE Christians and finally the true love that grows between a man and a woman. Although Inga and Olaf rarely communicate with full sentences, slowly they prove it with the giving of themselves. I love how she uses music and dance as a connection of two people. The separation of the wheat from the chaff although a quick shot in the film, shows the removal of what is not valuable so that in the end,  while the valuable grain (the heart of the matter) remains and is saved. I've heard that some felt the movie was slow. They are on the same scale as the Son who never comes to appreciate but is distracted by time rather than accepting the natural pace and beauty of his mother and father's story. For example, the scene where his mother Inga is speaking about her dead husband Olaf (his Father), and in a rush to disrupt what appears to him as unnecessary words, he interrupts his mother with a knock-knock joke that has no punchline.

1570110,5,B00005JPN8,"This is a lovely tale of a farming community of Norwegian immigrants in Minnesota after WWI.  Olaf, a taciturn bachelor farmer, has been sent a bride, apparently from his people back in the old country.  She arrives, bright and beautiful, carrying a large grammophone with a huge bell speaker, and speaking no English.

She's met by Olaf and his cheery friend, Fransen, whose joie de vivre makes up for Olaf's reticence. The director and screenwriter (whose name is strangely absent from the DVD case)
said, in the short interview that accompanies the film, that he met Alan Cumming and wrote the Fransen character for him.  He almost steals every scene in which he appears and, as he is an amateur photographer who entertains his friends and family with his magic lantern shows, he may be a sort of alter-ego for the director.

Fransen and his equally warm and lively wife, Brownie, bring Inge, the ""bride"" into their home and give her the welcome that poor shy Olaf can't quite manage.  There she must share sleeping quarters with the nine children, and finds herself dealing with feet in her face and worse....so she soon moves into Olaf's house with Olaf chastely sleeping in the barn.

Despite Olaf's reticence he does notice Inge's undies which flap on the line and catches a glimpse of ankle atop her black laced boot. But it seems that it's her love of his farm animals that really wins her a place in in his heart!  Inge, a strong and stubborn woman, is committed to being his wife, even when she runs into the problem that she is German and is therefore held in grave suspicion by the community.

The story is simple---how these two people eventually fall in love and build a life together, overcoming the problems that befall them.  Their relationship to the community is an important part of their lives; indeed one didn't survive without help from their neighbors in that time and place.

The cast is excellent.  The two principles, Elizabeth Reaser and and Tim Guinee are both very good looking. This helps us because we spend a lot of time just looking at them; they don't speak much to each other.  Inge's background is a little confusing and the film doesn't spell it out. She is of German nationality but apparently was living in Norway. But she doesn't speak Norwegian to Olaf, who is also from Norway.  Apparently they've decided to speak only English, which seems unrealistic to me.

The supporting cast is all great, too.  It was a treat to see the wonderful Paul Sand as the older Fransen.  And John Heard is always a pleasure to see.  His interpretation of the Lutheran minister is lovely; he toughly upholds what he believes are the standards of the community as well as shows a tender side.

The cinematography is lush.  At times I thought it was almost too beautiful.  The farm house in which they live is pristinely white and the interiors are awfully pretty for such a socially backward Norwegian farmer.  I find it hard to believe that he would have chosen to paint one the rooms that lucious shade of tourquoise!  However, as the film maker states, this part of the story is Inge's tale, as she remembers it and relates it to her grandson many years later....so it may be colored by her memory.  And it makes for a very visually appealing film.

I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in simple human stories, with no car chases, graphic sex or grisly crimes.  I found it especially interesting since my grandparents were Swedish immigrants in the Midwest.  This isn't a group of people we hear much about; they are not dramatic or flamboyant enough to attract much attention, but their quiet devotion to their ""Sweet Land"" and the folks who live on it, deserves much attention.",1322092800,,3720,4.691833590138675
1570111,4,B00005JPN8,"What separates this indi-drama from most of the others is the grand scope of the cinematography.  There are beautiful shots of the Minnesota grain fields, rolling hills and the lone farmhouse sitting at the top.  The story is a flashback (of course) of a dying woman named Inge.  As her grown grandson says his final goodbyes, he remembers back to 1968 when as a teenager, she tells him how she came to America.  Most of the film recollects that time, shortly after World War I.  She was a mail-order bride believed to be coming from Norway.  Alas, she was from Germany.  The prejudice of the time was against Germans or anything with socialist in their political affiliation.  This caused problems getting her citizenship papers and without those, couldn't be married to Olaf.  He takes her in anyway despite the scorn of the community.  The story is not so much about the heartache of the times or the difficulty of farm work, but about the strength of character of the people.  Elizabeth Reaser is terrific as the younger Inge.  I remember her best from a short lived TV series called ""Saved"" and a story arc on ""Grey's Anatomy"" but she is pretty and a pretty good actress.  Tim Guinee is also good as her mate Olaf.  I'm not familiar with his work but he's damn good here.  The movie has its faults.  Where is the generation between the grandmother and the grandson? No mention.  The movie drags a little in the middle but in the end I'm glad I searched out this little film.",1321056000,,1479,4.562737642585551

1570179,2,B00005JPN8,"Having just seen this movie on DVD, I ended up being puzzled about why it was made. I'm even more puzzled to discover that Ali Selim was born in Minneapolis, so the jarring inconsistencies in the script and visual parts of the movie make even less sense. I also must believe, based on this product, that children raised in Minneapolis, and who go on to schools there, live in a cocoon, a very liberal one, if the peans to Amnesty International and other do-good NGOs listed in the credits are to be believed.

I had a Minnesota beauty for a girlfriend once, and she was the product of a German mother and Norwegian father. So far as I know, they got along fine. I find it hard to believe that among Lutherans in the state prior to, during, and after WW I, such strong anti-German sentiment abounded. I do know that German-Americans in the upper midwest, of which there were many, were as patriotic as Norwegians, Swedes, etc. I just could not get my arms around the blatant meanness displayed against a Norwegian-speaking German girl as set forth in the film.

After all, in those days, the upper midwest, with its ferocious climate, was all about pulling together, cooperating, if you will, because if you didn't, you'd risk death. The make-believe, selfish, and sharply divided community depicted in the movie just didn't seem to pass the reality test. Also, the 40-ish happy housewife with her eleven children and relentless farm/home chores seemed unrealistically bright, healthy and vivacious. Who did the actual work around there? Both families' homes were painted movie-set bright white, sporting not only fresh paint but also ultra-clean farmyards. Olaf chopped some wood at one point, and also fed the hogs. That's it as far as daily chores go. Then comes the September harvest, when Olaf and his mail-order bride single-handedly, and without bloodied hands, cut down and collect about a quarter section of corn and harvest God knows how many acres of wheat, which they then proceeded to thresh themselves, by hand. All the while, the nasty people of the community who were shunning them go their merry way across the road using tractors and a stationary steam engine to harvest their wheat.

In short, a completely implausible script blended with accompanying implausible photography. The reviewer for the New York Sun explained that this movie was made for boutique, SunDance-type festival audiences, where sensitive filmmakers preen while appreciating each other's leftist, non-commercial sensibilities.

I had the infinite good fortune of a great friend and very special person introducing this experience (loaning the DVD) to me perhaps 6 months ago.  Since then I've watched, listened to and absorbed this film at least 10 times, including 4 in the past month, and twice on this night.

Why?

This is the story of ""ordinary"", hard working people - the very backbone that created the United States.  They are of a character all too scarce in country today.  They believed they were entitled to nothing - worked for everything.  Does that describe your neighbors?  Does it describe you?

Of infinitely greater importance, it is a love story.  It is a magnificent love story.

As for the rest of the typical viewers, don't expect anything fancy or action-packed, not even a staggering romance. Life is pretty slow in the 1920s, and since the girl barely speaks English, it makes it even slower, funnier, and unforgettable. Anything else I say is a spoiler ;-) BTW, I give it 5 stars for performance and cinematography, and 4 for script.

1570188,2,B00005JPN8,"I watched several segments of this film on the TV last weekend and noticed a subtle theme in all the segments I watched.  Basically, the theme is: religion is bad, Americans, especially hard-working middle Americans, are nasty half-witted bigots, especially the ones who go to church.  They are intolerant, and not enlightened like the Europeans are.  They persecute people for being socialists (gasp).

Well, I have a few things to say about that, but I leave it at a single example: At least hardworking ""American religious bigots"" did not murder 11 million Ukrainians.  Do I need to mention any other atrocities committed by socialists?  Even national socialists?

It's a film filled with beautiful scenery and lovely romance.  Hence 2 stars.

1570292,5,B00005JPN8,"What a lovely surprise this superb movie provided.

Inga, a young German woman, arrives in Minnesota as a mail order bride to marry Olaf, a young Norwegian farmer. The time is the immediate aftermath of World War One and when the small community learns that Inga is German, they put obstacles in her path so that she and Olaf are unable to marry. She barely speaks English and Olaf is a man of very few words.

This understated yet passionate and beautiful movie tells of how love slowly and quietly builds between the two and how they learn to appreciate one another, creating a common language that is almost wordless. How Inga sees Olaf's commitment to independence and justice extends to embrace his neighbor -- how Olaf sees Inga's strength of character and commitment to him and to his farm and to the land.

Everything about this movie rang just right for me. The photography of the prairie, the big sky, the ducks migrating for the winter and an attractive cast of minor characters. The pace of the movie was just right. It gets under the skin and by the end, one is profoundly moved because there is a truth at the heart of this movie. I cannot recommend it too highly.",1273276800,6,1178,4.547169811320755
1570293,5,B00005JPN8,"Not sure how to start, this film touched so many parts of me. First and foremost, I'd say it touched a part of my past that I've never known. How many of us never really know what hardships, joy and ""different kinds of happiness"" that our ancestors  experienced? And without knowing what their dreams, failures and everything they encountered, we can lose sight of what a legacy really is. For me, I am embarking on a fight for a family legacy, a struggle to keep our ""sweet land"" in the family. Not due to financial hardships, but a worse kind - for greed. My grandmother grew up in southern Iowa and moved to NW Iowa, very near to the location of this film. Here she gave birth to six children, only one son - my father. As is the case with many farm families, the son put aside all of his other dreams (of playing sports, of college, of getting off the farm in general...) to keep the family legacy going. 2,000 acres of corn and soybeans (not much wheat grown in Iowa, not in our area anyway) just he and my grandpa farmed, with help from the neighbors. The ""aunts"" went to college and none work on the farm anymore, they all live at least one hour away, and my parents live not even a mile from the homeplace. It no longer has any significance to them besides the money. Currently, farmland in our area is priced at upwards of $5,000 per acre.

Two years ago, my grandpa died, leaving the majority of our farm corporation to my grandma and my dad. Which made my aunts seethe with greed and hatred. We don't talk anymore, except through our lawyers. At the moment, it appears that in the event of my grandmother's debt, the entire farm assets must be liquidated within 60 days of her death so that they may have their inheritance. This is a multi-million dollar affair, and this film hit my heart when I saw that check for $2.2 million dollars that the older Lars was going to take to the bank. If he hadn't been told by his grandmother all that they went through to live and work their dream, would he have still not done the deal?? I know that my aunts would, and I know that my mom, dad nor I would. But it's still being threatened, it's a life that my parents love and the only one they know, and my grandkids may not ever experience.

This film gave me hope that our land will stay in the family. We, too, have Scandinavian roots, and the other themes - immigration, religion, the power of community, the strength of the equality that men and women had out there on the prairie, the stark landscapes (I wish they would've shown some winter scenes, it's so cold and barren and beautiful!!), the exile that some had to endure by not going with the status quo, the financial instability/fragility of depending on the land for your only income, and the connection of family - were so incredibly poignant to me. I am so proud to be where I'm from and that my family is fighting together to keep our legacy. But, I'm one of four kids, I'm sure the fight for my sweet land isn't yet over for me...",1270684800,5,2999,4.332740213523132

""Banking and farming don't mix"" - my relatives who are still out there on the

The romance in this movie may - or may not - be typical.  But when I chase the history of those who emigrated from Norway, I don't know if you could even describe ""typical"".  Chance played a huge role in who met whom, who married whom and settled where ever.

These folks sailed away from Norway ,or Germany, or....into an unknown and uncertain future.

I believe this movie PERFECTLY captures the role played by chance, circumstance,
character, and HARD WORK in settling the West.

1570298,5,B00005JPN8,"I'm not going to go into any great detail about SWEET LAND, which is also a very sweet movie, as previous reviewers here have done that already. I just wanted to add my opinion to the 50 others who have come before me.

This was a simple story about two immigrants who grow to learn about and love each other despite the obstacles they have to overcome along the way. This was also an adult romance without any sex, violence, or four-letter-words...and not even one Ford Model-T was blown up...so I think that alone will turn off some people. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD, which we got free from our local library, and were involved in the story and cared about the characters. If that isn't the real test of a movie's entertainment value then I don't know what is. The main characters, Inge (a mail-order-bride from post-WWI Germany) and Olaf (a farmer from Norway), try to marry and begin a life for themselves in 1920 Minnesota but are thwarted by the parish minister, who refuses to marry them, and the townspeople, who still harbor anti-German feelings. It isn't until Olaf stands up to the town banker, who is intent on foreclosing the farm of neighbor and friend Frandsen, that the minds and hearts of the minister and townsfolk are changed.

I think a few reviewers were less than enthusiastic about the movie because they either couldn't understand some of the dialogue (smatterings of Norwegian and German were spoken in the beginning) or thought it was just poorly accented jibberish. I guess they don't remember those old Folgers Coffee commercials starring Mrs. Olsen. ""Ja! It's mountain grown. The richest coffee there is."" otherwise they'd be less skeptical.

At any rate, I wholeheartedly recommend SWEET LAND to anyone who can appreciate good acting, a believeable story, and beautiful cinematography. One warning: Be sure to have a box of Kleenex handy.",1245024000,10,1883,4.841614906832298

1570399,2,B00005JPN8,"Here's a film that aspires to be included in the ranks of European Art Films but unfortunately doesn't quite make the grade. Before we flashback to the main story, we're treated to two ""flash forward"" scenes: one set in the 60s when the main character, Inge, buries her husband and another scene twenty or so years later when the grandson buries Inge. Instead of getting right into the story which is set in 1920s Minnestoa, we're treated to quite a bit of slow-paced, unnecessary exposition. When we finally do get to the core of the story, where Inge (well played by Elizabeth Reaser) comes to America, we find out little about the personalities of the characters.

Most of the first half of the movie deals with Inge trying to cope with a hostile community where she barely speaks any English (it's not really explained very clearly, but Inge is a mail-order bride from Norway but she's actually German who's been living in Norway). Her husband-to-be Olaf, is a Norwegian-American who is unable to communicate with her in German (it appears that he can speak Norwegian and so can she--well at least I thought I heard her speak some Norwegian during the film) but they choose not to because the town minister insists that she only speak English. So quite unconvincingly, when they are alone, they never converse in Norwegian which would probably help her to learn English a lot faster.

Reaser does a good job at showing how difficult it is learning a new language and there are some scenes that are fairly compelling as Inge and her hard-working farmer-husband learn to love each other. But beyond that what do we find out about the characters in this film? Well there's Olaf, who's a bit of a Stoic but also a real good guy who saves his best friend's farm by bidding for it at an auction (even though he doesn't have the money!). And of course there's the minister, who is caught up in the anti-German hysteria of the day and gives Inge a real hard time. But of course, he's really not such a bad guy after all because eventually he inexplicably comes to accept her. And in fact, all the neighbors, who at first appear as though they're going to start a witch-hunt against Olaf and his potential bride, suddenly have a change of heart and actually give Olaf the cash to buy his best friend's farm which prevents the family from being evicted.

1920 Minnesota doesn't prove to be much of a bad place after all--not a bad apple amongst the suspicious neighbors who all turn out to collectively have hearts of gold. It's comfortable like a Hallmark Greeting Card but does not bode well for good drama which needs more of a sinister protagonist to keep things interesting. As we step back into 1920, we feel the author only has a superficial sense of what it was like to live back in that time. Oh yes, there's a nice attempt to recreate the look of the period with the old Model-T cars and gramophones but without in-depth characters, the film ultimately proves to be an exercise in sentimental storytelling.",1237161600,4,3010,4.632958801498128
1570400,5,B00005JPN8,"In a fair world, SWEET LAND would have made Elizabeth Reaser a star.  Her performance is pitch-perfect and she is a very striking woman as well.  And in a fair world, SWEET LAND would have been watched by more than half a dozen people.

It's a familiar kind of story:  Reaser plays Inge, a young lady sent from Germany to Minnesota in the early 20th century to enter into an arranged marriage with Olaf, a young farmer originally from Norway.  Inge arrives, speaking perhaps 10 words of English and very little Norwegian.  Because the US has just finished up a war in which Germany was the enemy, the close-knit group of Norwegian farmers has a VERY difficult time accepting Inge as one of their own.  In fact, because her papers aren't satisfactorily n order, the young couple is unable to marry.  For awhile, Inge lives with Olaf's friend Frandsen (Alan Cumming), his wife (Alex Kingston) and their 9 or 10 children.  They are welcoming of their new friend, but Inge must share a bed with several kids and has no privacy at all at the communal bathtub.

Olaf has barely spoken to his beautiful but frustrating bride-to-be Inge...but that changes when one early morning, she sneaks into his house to take a bath and falls asleep in the tub.  Their first unescorted time together is rather funny, but it leads Olaf to also realize that he brought a woman to the US to help him farm, and by golly, that's what they're going to do...especially when Inge forces the issue and starts to demand chores and to know the names of his animals.

You can probably guess that a relationship blossoms between the two, but I must tell you that it is not reached via a familiar path.  Olaf is a good, sturdy man unused to speaking much...much less to women.  He is perplexed by this woman who has burst into his life, but has a grudging admiration too.  He doesn't so much feel bad for the hardships she endures, but sees her worth as a person and potential wife.  Inga, for her part, is willing to do her part in this arrangement, but she grows fond of Olaf in what is initially a merely friendly way.  I won't say they are like brother and sister...but to say that they are lovers without physical contact isn't quite right either.

The film shows us their estrangement from the Norwegian community, who cannot accept this new German woman and her ""dangerous German ways"" into their midst...and Inge & Olaf suffer greatly for it.  And the film shows how a greedy banker (Ned Beatty) keeps the community in his debt, literally.  This is a terribly clichd idea, yet it is handled in a manner to make it seem, if not new, then at least personal and particular enough to feel plausible.  There is a scene when a family farm is put on the auction block, and the unceremoniousness and cruelty of it are heart-wrenching...made more so by the fact that it is done with utter calm.

In fact, most of SWEET LAND is calm.  Inge IS capable of convincing shows of stormy emotion...but mostly the characters are quiet and unassuming.  But this is not to say there is no passion.  There is a scene when Olaf admits to Inge, ""I know ducks dream.""  You'd never believe it reading it here, but that line is an emotional turning point for the film, a cry from the heart and a moment of quiet smoldering.

The film is SLOW.  There are many lingering shots of the beautiful farm land (wheat and corn mostly) that are indulgent but stunning.  The sky is of most gorgeous blue and the grass of the most startling green.  I'd almost sworn I was looking at a Blu-Ray version of the film when I saw it on regular DVD...it's that saturated with color.

The story is told as a very long flashback...and I should warn viewers that the first ten minutes or so, set roughly in our times, are slow going indeed.  Yet once we go back in time and meet Olaf & Inge, the film comes to lovely life.

Tim Guinee plays Olaf.  He's an actor whose imdb biography has a rather impressively long list of credits, but frankly, the parts must have been small because I don't recognize him.  But he takes the clichd character of the taciturn, early American farmer and imbues it with new life and a quiet manliness that is understated yet totally convincing.  And Elizabeth Reaser (enjoying fame currently as Esme in TWILIGHT) is stunning.  The camera loves her, and spends a lot of time in close-ups of her face.  We see the subtle plays of emotion there and it is very easy to find her completely convincing as a flesh-and-blood person we can easily care about.  The relationship between Inge and Olaf is one of the best film romances I've seen in a long, long time.  Alan Cummings, Alex Kingston, Paul Sands (in a small role, but it was good to see him again), Ned Beatty and John Heard provide solid support.

It can be tricky to find this film from 2005, but it is HIGHLY worth the trouble.  While kids and teens would find the film crushingly slow-paced...I think adults with some patience will find themselves well rewarded.  When the story of Inge and Olaf ended, I was genuinely sorry to know that I would spend no more time with them.  See it!",1235260800,5,5094,4.496191512513602

This is a movie that gets deeper and richer each time you watch it.  There are so many little details and nuances.  The story is so beautifully simple, and the images are so rich that you almost feel like you are watching Inge and Olaf's story first hand.  I feld like I was sitting across from Inge on her train ride to Minnesota.  I could almost smell the prairie grass of their homestead.

I'm from North Dakota, and this movie created such a sense of nostalgia for me, a reminder of a truly better and simpler time.  The musical score is hauntingly beautiful and really adds a lot to the film.

And this story begins anything but a love story.  At the time of her husband's funeral, Inge reflects on how they met and got married.  Inge was a bride from Europe who had arranged marriage in place with Olaf, a farmer of Norwegian descent living somewhere in the midwest.  What Olaf is not aware of is that Inge is really of German descent and shortly after WWI has ended, Germans are less than popular in his community.  What can this community do about a young woman with no family who has travelled across ocean to be married to a man she never saw before and who speaks not a word of English?  The obstacles that these two young people encounter are great, but they are not waivering under pressure. They both do what both know is right and over time they win the respect and trust from their community.  What started as possible arranged marriage or marriage of convenience grows into a love story of great proportions.  What I really liked about this story is that it is not just a love story.  It is also a critique of set of beliefs in America about what it means to be American, or German or Norwegian and how it related to simply being human and decent.  It has been ages since I have seen a love story like this one.  Great movie, history lesson and commentary on living an honest, ordinary, hardworking life.",1215993600,3,1531,4.412811387900356

In the film, love triumphs over ignorance, prejudice, social hardships, and the other obstacles, not the last one, the difference in cultures and languages. German immigrant Inge (Lois Smith, a wonderful but rarely seen in the movies stage and TV actress) tells her life story to her grandson after burying her husband of 48 years on their farm in Minnesota in 1968. The story begins in 1920, when Inge (Elizabeth Reaser as Young Inge) just arrived to Minnesota as a mail-order bride to Norwegian-American farmer Olaf (Tim Guinee). Discovering that Inge is actually German, the community and its spiritual leader Minister Sorrensen refused to accept Inge as Olaf's wife echoing the anti-German propaganda in the country after WWI. The  touching tale of a young couple's falling in love, longing for each other, wishing to live and work together on the land till death do them part, and finally making the community accept their love, is beautifully shot and moves in a quiet thoughtful way where every small detail matters.

If the writers told our story the actors have learned us by heart.  I'll never forget the day the farm was auctioned.

1570609,5,B00005JPN8,"WHAT A TRUE BREATH OF FRESH MINNESOTA PLAINS AIR THIS FILM IS!!!2007's Independent Spirit Film of the Year! (The best since MEMENTO!)

This is the first film since THE NOTEBOOK and A LOVE DIVIDED and SOLOMON AND GAENOR that has captured, for me ,the sweet and unflappable love of the heart where two people are concerned. Simply put, SWEET LAND is a film about the longings of the heart that transcend dogma and conventionality.

In 1919, Inge Altenberg arrives from Norway to Minnesota as a mail order bride for Olaf Torvik, a Norwegian farmer now nine years in America. Inge (GREY'S ANATOMY Elizabeth Reaser) is obviously a woman of strong character and will to have made this trip. She meets her future husband Olaf,(Tim Guinee of LILY DALE) and his best friend Franzen (a truly winning Alan Cumming) and his wife,""Brownie"" (an equally amazing Alex Kingston).There is one problem: it is discovered that Inge is really of German decent,WW1 is still palpable, and the Minnesotan Lutheran Community just simply cannot risk Inge being a spy in the midst of such anti-German (as well as Chinese, we learn) sentiment in fledgling America. So, Olaf,a man of honor who will not allow Inge to be cast away, has her come to live on his farm. She sleeps indoors and he, the honorable thing to do, sleeps in the barn! They do not understand one another, but a ""love"" begins to form as the two daily work  together on the farm,in their community and to secure marriage papers. What happens here, as we learn, that in Norwegian there are two words for happiness: 'lydling' means overjoyed while 'glede' means delighted. This film, in essence, builds upon these two words in explaining a love that continues to grow into an affair of the heart, that is etched inside these two, despite consternation and opposition from outside.
This is one of the most appropriately cast films I have ever had the pleasure to watch. Reaser and Guinee have such sweet and restrained fondness for each other that you are sucked into the vortex of their quiet longing. Cumming and Kingston are such the consummate pros as the best friends. They are the lighthearted characters that give the only support and strength to Inge and Olaf. John Heard, as Lutheran Pastor Sorrenson,plays the perfect blend of a man obliged to follow dogmatic Church teachings, and yet still believes in a God Who could possibly look the other way.

The story easily drifts from the past, to a later period to the present day very fluidly and seamlessly with the help of veteran actress Lois Smith as the older Inge.

This film has won so many awards for acting,screenplay and direction this year that it easily ranks as the top Indie film for 2007. It is a film of such grace and nuance that it will be an extreme pleasure to share this film with many for years to come. I believe this film to be absolutely appropriate for family viewing,especially if the children are not those who must have ""action"".It is an extremely intelligent and informing work on the then-existing Immigration laws concerning aliens and also the laws of women's Suffrage. Mostly though, I am reminded of a song by Peter,Paul and Mary whose refrain is:""Home is where the heart is,no matter where the heart lives."" Love is not a law;love is not a dogma....but love exists inside the heart where two agree.",1194480000,3,3325,4.755632582322357
1570610,4,B00005JPN8,"This is a sweet movie that shows a young woman overcoming prejudice and strife as a young German wife who travels to America for a pre-arranged marriage to a farmer she's never met.  When the preacher refuses to marry them, it's only the beginning of the struggle.  Farmers in the community fight to hold onto their farms during financial hardships, and their friendships. I did find it confusing when they flashed forward to the grandson. I don't think enough details were filled in on that relationship, but it was still a wonderful movie.

1570611,5,B00005JPN8,"You know, it's about time that a theatrical romantic drama that is totally clean was released to the world. No slimy sex at all, just pure falling in love and the awesome feel of it. I was so pleased and warmed over watching this movie. My sister and I went on a quest to catch this movie at the theater because it was a small indpendent movie and some of the theaters that show these types of movies only have it for like one, maybe two weekends tops and airing at limited times per day. So we finally tracked it down in Santa Monica and were pleasantly pleased by its wholesomeness and innocence. Very well done! I'm glad it's out on DVD. This is something I'll watch over and over again!",1193788800,3,690,4.2748091603053435
1570612,5,B00005JPN8,"I purchased this movie on a recommendation from a friend.  He knew of my Scandinavian
background and thought I might like this DVD.  Well, he sure was right!
I had heard of stories like this from older family members of mine.
After watching the movie I fell in love with this love story and rekindled a
warm feeling for my Norwegian heritage.  Strong people make strong statements
about our culture by how they live out their lives.  The pastor was NOT the moral
teacher in this story.  Now I know again why I married my Norwegian wife.
I will watch this movie many times to uplift my spirit!",1193356800,3,592,4.444444444444445
1570613,3,B00005JPN8,"""Sweet Land"" is one of those little movies that almost strain too much for perfection.  As a ""love story"", it's very coy and constrained by the moral climate of the early 1900's (which it depicts).  As a sociological comment on the political undercurrents and prejudices of the period, it seems a bit wishy-washy, at first portraying stubborn narrow-minded behavior in the residents of the small Minnesota community, but then having the bigots ""come around"" to more kindly positions.

Still, I fell for the charm of the movie.  It's a very pretty film on its limited scale.  Some of the film frames would stand up well as regionalist paintings.  There's a nice musical score, even if it seems a little redundant of other movies of the type, like ""The Straight Story"".

Elizabeth Reaser is intriguing, even if she doesn't match Meryl Streep in the ability to mimic accents.  Alan Cumming once again makes the most of his talent for playing shy, clownish characters.  Ned Beatty and John Heard are two venerable actors, and their presences add a lot to the film.

In summary, I feel that this is is a beautiful small film that suffers from a lack of substance.  It definitely doesn't have the grandeur and sweep of ""Days of Heaven"", but it certainly has the old-timey vibe that should please the ""Utne Reader"" and ""Prairie Home Companion"" crowd.",1193011200,15,1343,4.820960698689956
1570614,5,B00005JPN8,"This movie was moving from beginning to end.  At the very beginning the phrase ""Let it be hoped that every life is preceded by a great love story"" about sums it up.  A film about a love that was not instant... something that could last for generations.  Simply beautiful.  The photography, fetching music, incredible acting (a lot of it done in Norwegian and German by non-native speakers)and intriguing story line that sometimes leaves you guessing at what happens to certain characters makes for a movie that you need to see several times to get the full value of.

1570615,3,B00005JPN8,"This is the story of a mail-order bride arriving in a farming town just after the First World War.  She encounters prejudice because she's of German origin and the farmers are all of Scandinavian descent and the jingoism of the war is still rampant.

The concept is excellent but it falls a bit flat because it's hard to care for the characters.  They are constrained by the script calling for moral rigidity and social conformance and thus they seem mostly wooden.

It's a story of pluck, fortitude, mutual cooperation and of our forefathers resolve to get on with life and for that it is praiseworthy.  Unfortunately, passion in those days had to be left in the closet and only at the very end do they manage to open the door.

The film has much to recommend it, now if only you could care about it as well.",1192752000,5,809,4.469387755102041

1570740,4,B00005JPN8,"""Sweet Land"" is an unusual love story set among homesteading immigrants in Minnesota farm country shortly after World War I. Olaf Torvik (Tim Guinee) came to the US from Norway in 1910, moved west, cleared some land, and became a farmer. A decade later, his parents in Norway find him a wife. Inge Allenberg (Elizabeth Reaser) arrives by train with 2 suitcases and her indispensable phonograph. But Inge is a German national. Post-war sentiment toward Germans prevent the minister and judge from marrying the couple. Olaf is frustrated by the situation, but Inge is determined to be his wife.

""Sweet Land"" director Ali Selim adapted the film from Will Weaver's short story ""A Gravestone Made of Wheat"". The story of Inge and Olaf provides an window on an American culture rarely seen in film. The farms' placid beauty defies the harsh realities of eking out a living in this fickle environment. I was entranced by the quietness that results from Olaf's laconic nature and Inge's inability to speak English. The actors do a splendid job of conveying Inge's resolve and Olaf's frustrated longing and fear of this stranger with few words. ""Sweet Land""'s framing device is awkward, but it does give the story context and leaves the audience satisfied to know how things turned out.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): There is one featurette, a theatrical trailer (2  min), and an audio commentary. ""Sweet Land: A Labor of Love Story"" (11 min) interviews director Ali Selim about his intentions and talks with the cast about their characters and themes. The audio commentary is by writer/director Ali Selim, actors Tim Guinee and Elizabeth Reaser, editor James Stanger, and producer Gil Bellows. Selim and Stanger discuss the framing device. Selim talks about adapting the story. Also discussed are locations, the score, performances, shooting anecdotes, and the actors share their experiences. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French.",1187913600,16,1959,5.115625

1570742,5,B00005JPN8,"A friend recommended we see this movie so we drove 90 miles to the nearest theatre to view this independant flick. Wow! Now, we have the video and are every bit as impressed. Filmed on location in the vicinity of Montevideo, MN Sweetland exudes a rare authenticity that simply grips the heart and soul. Pastoral settings, migrating geese flying by, the harvest the old fashioned way...it's all there, with great magnificence and integrity. We tend to forget life tensions around 1920, emigration pressures, foreign language miscommunications, ostracism, hard work, the influence of the church and minister...While you're immersed in the story it suddenly hits you that certain contempory issues also echo within this unfolding drama. How many films have you seen lately that are bold enough to go a full ten minutes before the main title comes to view? It's 1 hour 50 minutes long. The ten minute behind the scenes feature reveals what inspired the writer and the director, adding additional dimensions to the moving story. We haven't yet taken in the audio commentary, that'll be next. Buy it, watch it, show it to your kids. Keep your hankies close, it'll tug powerfully at your heart, especially so if you have roots in the great midwest.

There is one scene of her bathing you see her back (from the waist up), no private ""areas"" showing... because of the bare back, for some reason they put ""partial nudity"" on the back of the PG rating, since all it was , was her back, I thought that was funny. This is a great family movie for parents who are still trying to monitor the filth that is added in most movies these days.
  ....... A great story line mail order bride from Germany, sent to a Dutch farmer, in Minnesota, by his parents who lived in Germany........ The community hates germans because of the first world war.... Everyone is predjudiced against anyone ""un-American"".. Love, drama, humor, and tears..... GOOD MOVIE> RENT IT! WATCH IT! BUY IT!
  It won a bunch of awards in a few film festivals- including best picture and best actress........ i don't think it's gotten much publicity though. I bet if it had a raunchy sex scene & some swear words, it'd get alot more press, in this present non-moral, God-less society... People in this day and age forget that a story can still be told well, without being rated R & full of foul mouths & graphic nudity...............
This is proof there can be a great movie made, an artistic achievment, without the filth most movies now awadays feel compelled toadd. No graphic nudity needed to prove points.... IT stands on it's own, clean, 2 feet.

The acting is good; however, I thought the Inge's German accent was poor. The story takes place in post war times. The movie addresses bigotry, love and bravery. When Olaf risks it all to save his friend's farm from the bank; it was a really touching moment.

The negatives are minor. I mentioned the accent. The movie uses flashback sequences to tell the story. It gets confusing sometimes about who is remembering what. The production values are pretty high, but you can tell they took short cuts sometimes with the sets.

It is a very good period piece about people who don't often get movie made about them but who built the country through their bravery, tenacity and hard work.",1185148800,3,858,4.6381578947368425
