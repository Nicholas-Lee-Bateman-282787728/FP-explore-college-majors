8734351,5,B015RHRYUE,Pretty interesting film. Good use of 90 minutes. I didn't know anything about Peggy Guggenheim before watching this or really know who she was. You get a good overview of her life and art collecting and some family history. Ask your local library to order a copy of it if you'd like to see it.,1487289600,2,293,4.345454545454546
