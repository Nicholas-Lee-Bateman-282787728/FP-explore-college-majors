2070397,5,B00029LO5O,"I don't understand it when critics and movie-goers alike slam an altogether terrific movie. What's not to like? The cast and their performances are amazing, the script is wonderfully and realistically written, and it tiptoes between humor and sadness at the same time. Kevin Smith did an absolutely amazing job putting this film together, a film that will make you laugh and cry-- a feat that oftentimes proves too difficult for movie makers to accomplish, but Kevin Smith pulls it off with charm and wit.

Jersey Girl stars Ben Affleck as Ollie. His wife Gertie (played by J.Lo, who is great in the fifteen minutes of the film she's in) dies while giving birth to their first child. Ollie is a publicist, a job that is hectic even when your own your own, but add a baby and that's chaos. Ollie's nerves are frazzled one day as he's trying to care for the baby, who he's named after his wife, and talk to the press about new star Will Smith. In utter frustration, Ollie does the unthinkable-- he says he can't believe the Fresh Prince will ever be a huge star-- in front of EVERYONE. This obviously gets him fired, and the rest of the film takes place in Jersey with Ollie still coping with his wife's death and raising an 8 year old girl.

Ben Affleck gives a stellar perfomance. I honestly didn't know he had it in him, but I have to give him credit. Raquel Castro, who plays little Gertie, is everything an 8 year old should be-- funny and completely candid. Liv Tyler and George Carlin also give great perfomances. With this movie, Kevin Smith proves that he doesn't need Jay and Silent Bob to make a great movie, and as much I love Jay and Silent Bob, I'm glad he's finally departed with the characters and is moving on.

I highly recommend this film. It's a great comedy, it's a great drama, it's just a great movie. Trust me-- it's much better than Gigli.",1091577600,,1862,4.486725663716814
2070398,4,B00029LO5O,"I have been reading the bad reviews for Jersey Girl since it was released, and maybe that is why i was pleasantly surprised by the movie. It was the best performance i have ever seen Ben Affleck in, and the other actors did a very good job also. The movie was funny and emotional at the same time.",1091577600,,297,4.137931034482759
2070399,4,B00029LO5O,"Can the man who has created some of the most crude, vulgar, and offensive films in recent memory prove he has heart and yet retain a connection with the cult following his raunchy features have created? That is the question cult-director Kevin Smith is facing with the release of his new film, Jersey Girl. Smith has come a long way from his humble beginning working in a convenience store in his home state of New Jersey, the same place where he filmed his first movie, Clerks. After collecting nearly $27,000, Smith shot the film in the convenience store and premiered it at the Sundance Film Festival becoming one of the biggest highlights of the event. Once he struck up a distribution deal with Miramax, the then still relatively unknown independent studio, Smith completed work on Mallrats, which ended up being a complete dud. After publicly apologizing for the film, Smith bounced back in a big way with Chasing Amy, wowing both the critics and the public alike with his perceptive dialogue. With the controversial Dogma and critically lauded Jay & Silent Bob behind him, Kevin Smith hopes to return to the genre that made him prominent in the main stream world of filmmaking.

The story focuses on a man who once had everything in the world he could ask for but saw everything come falling down to Earth after the birth of his daughter. Ollie Trinke is one of the biggest music publicists in New York City and everything seems to be working perfectly for him. He has a well paid job, a beautiful wife, and a brand new child on the way. It seems as though nothing could wrong ? until one day it does. Struggling with the concept of being a single father after the death of his wife and a hectic career on top of that, Ollie snaps at a large press event and ends up losing his dream job. With nothing left for him besides his infant daughter, he moves back to New Jersey with his father and for the next seven years takes up grunge work in which he finds no contentment in. In those seven years Ollie?s only priority is his daughter and remains in a continual rut until one night while renting movies from the video store he meets Maya. After bantering him about renting a porno and being caught by little Gertie in the act, Maya strikes up a close friendship with the reflective father, who still dreams of the life he once had. When he has the opportunity to return to the life he has missed for seven years, Ollie must decide whether to be return to the life he believes is still waiting for him or be happy with the life he has now. The story for Jersey Girl, like that of Chasing Amy, is full of rich, discerning dialogue that audiences have come to love from Kevin Smith, with the vulgarity toned down a tad (note the word ?tad?). Though the plot treads on the line of predictability, the conservative message it expresses and the importance it lays on the issue of family makes the whole thing worth while.

There are several things to expect from a Kevin Smith film, one of which includes a well-stocked cast that includes several familiar faces from his previous films. That remains true for this film although they are mainly pushed to the background, with the exception of lead man Ben Affleck. Before focusing on anything else, let?s get the most prominent subject out of the way ? Unless you had serious problems with the chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in Gigli (we?re talking recursive nightmares here), any complaints should remain at a minimum as the two are only together for about eight minutes on screen and don?t present mis-matchment in that time frame. Despite certain moments of relative dryness, Affleck?s performance on screen doesn?t a problem at all on screen and shouldn?t for anyone outside of those who hate the man going into the film. Raquel Castro accentuates on screen with a wonderfully balanced chemistry with Ben Affleck and properly illustrated connection with several supporting members of the cast. The main emphasis on this talented young actress has to be the look she presents on screen, which is a somewhat eerily reflection of a childlike version of Jennifer Lopez. This effect stresses the message that Smith tries to get across within the plot of the film. Though the sequence barely makes a dent within the nearly two hour feature, the selective and well construed conversation between Will Smith and Affleck?s Ollie Trinke brings every point Smith attempts to get across in this film all into one cumulative moment. The whole piece feels so honest and realistic that audience members can truly understand the meaning that is presented in this conversational moment.

Overall, despite lacking the bite and edginess that Kevin Smith?s features are known for, Jersey Girl showcases not only his talented writing ability but his belief in the value of the family and its importance in life as well. No doubt several ?Jay & Silent Bob? fanatics will come out of this ranting on how Smith has sold-out but if that?s true then perhaps Smith is the only true one within the ViewAskew universe that has matured. Granted the film is far from perfect with the cinematography being off at times, the plot trailing off every so often into the obscure realm of predictability and the musical score not working with the actions on screen, this despite the fact that several songs used worked much better. So what should make you go see this film out in theatres? Its message. In the modern world where society has been taught that the most important element in life is success and anything else prior to that must take a backseat, Smith recalls the values we once had prior to the Hilary-esque village concept. Family, most importantly the children, must be the most essential part of a person?s life and nothing; absolutely nothing should come before that. Smith also emphasizes the idea most prominent in The Great Gatsby in that although many of us would love to return to the life we had in the past, realistically we know that?s not going to happen and giving up on an unobtainable dream to focus on the present reality isn?t always the life of quiet desperation. Not necessarily Kevin Smith?s most fanatically successful film but showcases maturity in the realm of filmmaking.",1090454400,2,6241,4.734375
2070400,4,B00029LO5O,"Kevin Smith has produced a movie that dispenses with his normal scatological humor and his fans do not like it one bit. That says more about them than it does about Jersey Girl, a touching if formulaic movie starring the much underappreciated Ben Affleck as a widowed single father who is raising his daughter while trying to get back to the life and career he once had. This is a good movie and it demonstrates that Smith has a range that extends beyond the four-letter word toilet comedy that appeals to his normally below normal adolescent audience.

Jersey Girl begins when Ollie Trinkie (Affleck), a high-powered Manhattan publicist, finds himself a widower when his wife, played competently by Affleck?s ex-fiancee Jennifer Lopez, dies in childbirth. When Ollie offends his client ? the actor Will Smith - under the strain of trying to balance his career with his responsibilities as a parent, he finds himself out of a job and moved in with his father, Bart (George Carlin).

Flash forward seven years and Ollie is working with his father for the public works department of the New Jersey suburb where they live while raising his beloved daughter, Gertie, played by a wildly talented child actress named Raquel Castro. Ollie?s life is now one of street sweepers, sewer lines, school plays, multiple failed attempts to get back into the New York publicists business and weekly trips to the video store with his little daughter where he meets Maya (Liv Tyler), a grad student working her way through school while she completes her thesis on married men and pornography. They fall in love, though that is not the focus of the story.

The rest of the plot follows a predictable course. Ollie finally gets an interview that will allow him to move back to New York and his old career, dismaying his father, Maya and Gertie. Worse still, the interview is the same afternoon as Gertie?s school play in which Ollie is supposed to participate.

The flaw in Jersey Girl is obvious. The plot has been done a thousand times before and the outcome is not in doubt. This outrages Kevin Smith's fans, who are not happy when movies are not about frustrated lesbian love affairs and the joys of prolonged adolescence. However, there is a reason for formulas. They work when done right, and Jersey Girl is done very right.

The point is not the plot, per se, rather the point is the characters and whether they are engaging enough as people for the audience to be able to relate to them. Here is where Jersey Girl works its magic. Jersey Girl?s characters are refreshingly normal. The audience relates to them because their motivations are very human, their flaws are understandable and not so extreme as to be inexcusable, and their underlying nobility turns them from ordinary into extraordinary people. In short, they are a delight to watch and it is easy to care about them. From Ollie's life of quiet desperation and its competing deep love for his daughter to his father's grumpy old man sentimentality to Maya's wide-eyed good heartedness to Gertie's genuine childlike love for her father and her family, the characters elicit sympathy, empathy and admiration.

Moreover, the formula works because the situations are real. It is hard not to laugh when Ollie is faced with the daunting task of trying to answer Gertie's questions about ?boy parts.? How many parents have similarly squirmed? Equally, the pain is palpable when Ollie, desperate to go to the interview that will get him his old job, angrily tells his daughter that he hates her because she took his life away. He instantly regrets what he says and begs for forgiveness from his little girl as the tears stream down her face. The scene hurts because the audience knows how often hasty words are said in anger.

Also, the acting in Jersey Girl is terrific. As Maya, Liv Tyler has a role where her looks and charm perfectly mesh with her character. Maya shocks with her forwardness but attracts with her warmth and tenderness. George Carlin as Bart splendidly mixes blue-collar harshness with the wisdom of years. He does not preach, but he lives by an uncomplicated moral code and he expects it to be followed. Raquel Castro as Gertie is magnificent. This young girl displays a mastery of dialogue and expression so natural that it seems effortless. Jason Biggs, Stephen Root and Mike Starr also do well in their supporting roles, as does, it must be said in all fairness, Jennifer Lopez

Special credit, however, deserves to be given to the much-abused Ben Affleck. If Jersey Girl is being punished by fans and critics because Kevin Smith dared to write a movie for people too old to read comics, Affleck is being doubly punished because he dared to date Jennifer Lopez. There is no other reasonable explanation for criticizing his work in Jersey Girl.

Previously, Bounce was Affleck's best leading man romance movie. However, in Jersey Girl, Affleck makes a quantum leap. He brings to the role of Ollie a genuineness and sincerity that the cynically inclined are too quick to dismiss. Most of all, Affleck makes an unbelievably convincing father. He manages a tone of voice and demeanor that conveys by turns parental pride, exasperation, uncertainty, humor, grief, subdued desperation and the deep sense of love to which any parent could relate. No Hollywood-style father-daughter banter here, thank goodness. Affleck does serious work in Jersey Girl, and if he lacks the range of some actors, he still shows a real ability to express the depths of human feeling.

Jersey Girl's main sin is that it lacks the biting irony that has been the hallmark of Smith's other films. Instead, what Jersey Girl offers is a tribute to those bonds of love and friendship that are the glue of family and the foundation of character. Is it formula? Sure, and the world could use a bit more of it.",1090368000,20,5840,4.836836836836837
2070401,4,B00029LO5O,"So I admit that it's not the best I've ever seen of Afleck.  It is the best I have seen of J Lo (though that is not saying much).  But the movie overall is pretty good.  I am an avid Kevin Smith fan and as such I was excited to see the movie, but I did not get my hopes up.  I found this movie to cater very much to his fans.  In my opinion it is an attempt for Kevin Smith to bring a heartfelt family type, quasi-chickflick to his fans who probably aren't the biggest fans of those types of movie.  Unfortunately for other moviegoers, it seems to be lost on them as the style doesn't fit into any ""normal"" category.  It is for that reason that I applaud him.  This isn't the best movie Kevin Smith has made, but it is very enjoyable and successfully translates Smith's style to other genres of film.  The movie is fun, funny, and touching.  Raquel Castro is absolutely enchanting, Carlin gives a wonderfully touching but hilarious performance, and Afleck can be sentimental if you give him a chance and don't prejudge.
Other people say that this film is just a rehash of the cliche, but then aren't most touching chickflick type movies?  I think that Kevin Smith's style adds a great deal to the movie to make it stand out from the rest, as I am tired of all the other cliched heartfelt movies.
However, I'm waiting to buy the movie until it comes out on Special Edition with all those great Kevin Smith extras next year.",1089763200,,1422,4.30827067669173
2070402,1,B00029LO5O,"i think this movie is another thrown in one. i don't understand directors these days. all they care bout is makin money and not makin a good movie for the audience. whats up wit Killing Jennifer Lopez anyways. she needs to survive (...)for the movie to actually be worth it. come on now, whats a movie wit out JHOE",1088380800,,314,4.338983050847458
2070403,4,B00029LO5O,"Folks, I am a long-time devoted fan of one Kevin Smith.
His first five films, along with his short-lived animated series are nothing less than classic.
With that in mind, here's my take on ""Jersey Girl"":
Short and sweet.
The first 20 minutes or so are perhaps the most excruciating ever captured on celluloid. Jennifer Lopez is expected to be godawful, and it's my firm belief that it's not Affleck who's sucking with her. There is, in fact, so much suction coming from the black hole that is her glaring lack of talent (at least since ""Selena"") that he is as such, terrible simply by association.
That being said, the rest of the film is absolutely brilliant! Kevin Smith's first step away from our beloved Jay and Silent Bob gives us all hope for his future films and projects.
Affleck (beyond the first 20 minutes) shows the viewer one of the best performances in such a role as I've seen in over a decade. Liv Tyler is absolutely enchanting, and young Raquel Castro is sure to be one of our future's best talents.
Lest we forget the great George Carlin, who, even playing the proverbial ""straight man"" is as gold as ever.
So, before I drop my nonexistant street cred any lower with these overeffeminate descriptions, I'll simply leave you with these words:
See ""Jersey Girl"". Ignore the opening scenes, and enjoy the ingenious remainder. It is my firm belief that, were it not for the dreadful beginning, our own Silent Bob might have been up for a few Oscars (and even now, I believe he deserves at least a nomination for best original screenplay).
Even so, buy it, see it, and unlike the rest of the Bennifer(and let's all thank God that phrase is now out of the common lexicon)-poisoned public, make up your own mind about this one. You'll be glad you did.

2070404,4,B00029LO5O,"I'm a big fan of Kevin Smith's first five movies, but I was well aware before entering the theater for Jersey Girl that this was not View Askew's classic blend of dick and fart jokes.  If I hadn't known that, I might have wondered what the hell was going on, as this is actually a touching movie.
Jersey Girl has less similarities to Mallrats and more to Chasing Amy; it's about how love doesn't always go the way you think it should, but that doesn't mean it sucks completely.  One thing that really took me by surprise was that the movie was less about Ollie Trinke and the video store clerk falling in love, but more about Ollie connecting with his daughter, and discovering what he really wants out of life, with a little help from Will Smith (ANOTHER big surprise there!  Sorry if I ruined it for ya).
The movie may not be as slapstick and vulgar as Smith's previous works, but that doesn't mean it's squeaky clean and straight-laced; plenty of laughs in this flick.  I liked the fact that Gertie, rather than perform something childlike and cute at the pageant, chooses a scene from Sweeny Todd, of all things.  The acting here is as top-notch as the cast that delivers it; Jason Biggs and George Carlin were great, and Liv Tyler is cute as a button.  Also, the soundtrack deserves a nod, especially for throwing in that Cure song at the end, which fit in perfectly.
The quabbles I had with the movie are few.  The biggest one was the scene in which Trinke is talking to his infant daughter about her mother; it's a little too melodramatic.  Afflek's acting just wasn't his best there, but it's still a good scene.  The choice to include ""Landslide"" in the soundtrack was poor; not because it's a bad song, mind you (as it's not), but because I'm sure it's been used in plenty of soundtracks before, and it was a ""safe"" choice.  Also, the scene with the diaper-changing was disgusting... though it was supposed to be.  Actually, I just don't like watching the scene, heh.
So I give this movie 4/5 stars.  I don't think it's his best work ever, and it's dangerously close to chick flick status, but it's a really good movie that will warm your soul.  View Askew has by no means lost their touch, and I hope whatever movies they produce in the future are this good or better.",1086825600,16,2279,4.475845410628019

Then the acting was absolutely INCREDIBLE.  George Carlin, Liv Tyler, and Racquel Castro could not have possibly been any better.

I liked this movie a lot before I had my little girl. Now I absolutely adore it!

I know this movie got panned by hard core Kevin Smith fans, but I don't get it. I'm a hard core Kevin Smith fan. I love Jay and Silent Bob as much as the next guy. But Jersey Girl simple isn't part of the Clerks story line. So what?

It's a story about a single dad who struggles with raising his little girl while working a career he hates. Along the way he meets a woman and an adorable story ensues. It's a sweet movie about a guy who loves his daughter. There is no going wrong here.

And not to spoil the ending, but when I see Ben Affleck dancing with his daughter to Pete Townshend singing Let My Love Open The Door.....the tears start flowing. The last time I watched that scene I went right up to my 4 year old's bedroom and woke her up just to hug her.

Also, the movie is really funny throughout. George Carlin delivers his brand of awesomeness perfectly. And can you really go wrong with Live Tyler?",1438214400,4,1032,4.14

2070854,4,B00029LO5O,"If ever you wanted to know what it would be like to see a Kevin Smith-directed romantic comedy, here you go.  A very underrated movie that got a lot of flack from the masses over the choice of casting J-Lo as the wife of Ben Affleck's character (this was during the height of Bennifer-mania), it is actually quite well put together.  I will admit, I didn't give it any real consideration until just a couple years ago when I caught a heavily-edited version of it on daytime television while I was sick.  If you're looking for Jay and Silent Bob or any references to the View Askewniverse, then you need to look elsewhere.  While the bulk of the movie does take place in Highlands, NJ, this doesn't follow the canon of movies such as Clerks (and it's sequels), Chasing Amy, or even Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  So I cannot stress enough....if you're looking for the typical d*ck and fart jokes that most of Kevin Smith's movies are known for, you will be sadly disappointed.  But if you're looking for a romantic comedy with just the right amount of tragedy and Smith's penchant for wordy dialog and foul-mouthed humor sprinkled throughout, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1431388800,,1185,4.673076923076923

2070862,5,B00029LO5O,"I'm a pretty big Kevin Smith fan but never did get around to seeing this film until now due to all of the negative reviews and whatnot along with the fact that it's not part of the 'View Askewniverse'.  I'm glad that I finally did because the criticisms are groundless in my opinion.  I've seen everything from insulting the actors and praising the writing to praising the actors and insulting the writing to justify the hatred of this film and the only thing consistent is an undertone of an audience who appears upset that this isn't the usual Kevin Smith fare.  I suppose I can understand their apprehension if they went into the film with certain expectations which weren't met, but having watched the film objectively as just another movie, I quite enjoyed it.  The film was funny, heartfelt and had great characters that show real growth throughout the film (as is expected with such a 'tugging-at-your-heartstrings' sort of semi-romantic comedy).

I recommend that you give the film a chance and see it for yourself, especially if you have Amazon Prime since it's available to stream at no cost.  It's definitely worth the watch if you go in without expectations beyond an entertaining, funny (though perhaps a bit brief in my opinion) romantic comedy.  It isn't a groundbreaking indi film and it's not a movie aimed solely at the geek crowd (of which I am a card carrying member :P).  It's way more mainstream but still has an edge and definitely still has the sensibility of a Kevin Smith film at its core with a moral lesson or two about learning from life and finding one's true place in this world (a theme which runs through all of the Askewniverse films if you pay attention).  It boils down to being a picture about a decadent ass who falls in love, loses his wife, neglects and resents his daughter and then finally comes to his senses and finds his heart, devoting himself totally to his offspring and his family (the family consisting of both blood and friends; another theme found throughout all of Smith's films).

So yeah, just as with Smith's more unorthodox (and awesome) works from the past, his heart is in the script and it shows.  This film simply speaks with a more mainstream voice, but the same message still comes through clear as day and I for one enjoyed it very much and hope that they get around to releasing this extended edition I've heard about as my only complaint is that once the film ended, I wasn't quite ready for it to be over.  Not that I didn't feel there was closure, as there certainly was; I just wasn't quite ready to leave these characters' lives just yet (not that I don't feel that way quite frequently with most good films, as a good movie will always leave you wanting more).

So give this one a chance, or don't.  But I believe you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least see what it's about for yourself, especially if, like me, you disregard all of the off-the-set tabloid crap about Ben and Jennifer and whatever other offscreen controversies may have led to the critical interpretations of this film.",1430265600,,3077,4.642725598526703

2071123,2,B00029LO5O,"Premise is a worn one: widower who lost his wife in childbirth is raising his daughter alone with the help of his curmudgeonly father (and father's eccentric friends), widower must resolve his inner struggle between fatherhood and ego/career; eventually meets free-spirited young woman and must then resolve his inner struggle between remaining emotionally ""faithful"" to his deceased wife and allowing himself to fall in love again; all is resolved with guidance from widower's cute, wiser-than-her-seven-years daughter.

A tired premise doesn't have to result in a tired plot, but in Jersey Girl, it does.  A lot of that may be down to Ben Affleck's performance.  I think this is the first film I've seen him in.  Now I kind of get why he's the butt of a lot of jokes about stiff acting.  It didn't help that there were a lot of gratuitous gags that revolved around the juxtaposition of a seven year old girl and various sexual themes.  Such as the child walking in on Affleck and Tyler in the middle of what Tyler's character later calls a ""mercy jump"", and then using the situation to leverage her dad into performing a number from Sweeney Todd with her for the school pageant. It probably sounds funnier on paper.

Can't really recommend this film.",1413072000,,1252,4.849765258215962

So have alot of my friends that I've practically grown up with ( I'm 34) , a number of them think this movie is Kevins big theatrical mistake, the worst thing hes done.  To me its the one thing hes done that I can actually relate to.  It's a guy who worked hard at it, had what hed been wanting all that time and then lost it all in a second.  He loses his wife Poof! Loses his career Poof! Then he has to move in with his dad.  He's so depressed that he doesn't even try to reach out and be there for his newborn baby Gertie.  He starts out his new life driving a street sweeper in new jersey. He with a good swift kick from dad, lovingly played by the late George Carlin, starts to bond with his kid.  He meets a great girl and his life begins to change in ways he didn't expect and is hesitant about.  Now im not a widower and i have no children but I've had dreams I've worked my butt off for and had them all of a sudden pulled out from under my feet and to me  Jersey Girl is a relatable film.  Now I 've seen complaints about language and crudeness.  ITS A KEVIN SMITH MOVIE!  Kevin Smith, View Askew , George Carlin!  This movie is going to have dirty jokes ! This movie is going to have sexual references! This is a movie that I can watch with mom. Hey , its one of her favorites but if your uptight at all with your kids be a good parent and watch it first.",1411776000,,1470,3.889261744966443

Just a note depending where you are in life may affect how much you like this film.  If you have kids you will like or love it.  If you are under 25 and/ or without kids you will probably hate it.  If you tend to be very critical of movies, you will not like it.
This movies hits home to working parents.  It will make you want to spend more time with your kids.  As for people that complain about the language, it is not that harsh.  This is the real world, not a sugar coated family movie.  Terrific supporting cast by the way.",1408233600,,804,4.122580645161291

He just seems embarrassed by the whole thing.  You are constantly aware that he is ACTING as it never rings true. With a story as simple and rather silly as this one you need a very strong male lead to lift the turkey right out of the barnyard and Ben, bless his heart I'm sure he's a nice guy, just can't pull it off.

2071237,5,B00029LO5O,"Ben Affleck stars as a successful publicist who losses his high profile job in New York when his explodes during a press conference.  After the lost of employment and his beautiful wife (Jennifer Lopez) during child birth he moves to New Jersey to live with his father (George Carlin) and his infant daughter.
The movie is about Oliver Trinke (Ben Affleck) and his relationship with his daughter Gertrude (Raquel Castro).  Castro is great as Ollie's daughter.  Her performance is one of the best child performance I have ever seen.  She makes you laugh and cry with her great acting ability.  But to me Myia (Liv Tyler) stole the show.  She is the love interest in Trinke's life.  The Video Store scenes and Dinner scene between Tyler and Affleck are classically funny and romantic.
This movie had me laughing, crying and contemplating the value of career or family.  My question to everyone who watched Jersey Girl is: did Ollie make the right decision by not taking a high profile position in New York as a publicist at Angelotti's (his life's work) or staying in a dead-end city job and living with his father and daughter in New Jersey?",1394928000,,1140,4.751269035532995

It's a good film by a good writer and director, Kevin Smith. It's cute, funny, charming, and it has meaning. What really sticks out to me in this film is Liv Tyler. I can't understand how she isn't a bigger movie star. Part of being a movie star is acting, but a big part is screen presence. Liv Tyler is absolutely adorable in this film. You can't take your eyes off her and her character is witty, sarcastic, and charming. Liv Tyler is a star in my book. Raquel Castro is also adorable as the main character's young daughter.

An incredible young actress who has Ben Affleck and her Pop, played to amazing nonchalance and toughness by GEORGE CARLIN, wrapped around her tiny talented digits. Ben Affleck plays a NYC public relations agent who is fired & is subsequently raising his daughter in NJ, while he works for the township digging up sewers & streets. George Carlin & his street plowing buddies are fun fun fun...and even more noteworthy, REAL REAL REAL. Nods to beautiful Liv Tyler for her performance as she injects an interesting sexual energy into this film. Caution: there are subjects within which are adult.

(It seems to be showing all over the place now though)  I ordered it, as much to see it from the beginning as I did to share it with my wife, family, friends, and anyone else I can convince to sit through it.  This movie shouldn't work.  It is precariously balanced upon a delicate premise with a lead character who is not particularly likable.  George Carlin does not generally come off as being comfortable playing roles other than himself, although this seems to be the role he was preparing himself for all his life!  I would not have believed Liv Tyler could sell herself in the role of a down to earth counter person either, but I didn't even recognize her the first time I saw the film, so I was wrong before I even asked the question.  I have a whole new respect for Kevin Smith, which means of course, that he has decided to stop making movies altogether.

I just found Affleck's character so thoroughly unlikeable on so many levels that it was just unwatchable.  The supporting cast, on the other hand, is pretty good, especially Liv Tyler and the little girl.

Note:  I once heard that there was an original cut that got pulled after Gigli did so badly, to cut more of Lopez's role in order to appease audiences of something.  Supposedly, that was better, but as that was not the part that bothered me at all, I don't think it would have made me like the movie better.",1376697600,,633,4.469565217391304

Well, this was it.  There is no reason why Jersey Girl should've sucked like this - It just did.  Apparently, the cast and crew were bored and were looking for a way to burn some money.  They certainly found it.

But, if you are a Kevin Smith-o-phile as I am, you feel obligated to own this film and add it to your collection.  Seriously, I payed $5.99 for the blu-ray and two-day free shipping on Amazon Prime.  A truckload of horse manure costs at least twice that.  (And without a farm, I'll get much more use out of the movie - Even if I only watch it once.)",1373414400,,805,4.342281879194631

If you're expecting Jay & Silent Bob, Randal, Dante, or basically the entire View Askewniverse, you're gonna be disappointed to find out this doesn't even have Jason Mewes in it! However, if you want Mewes, he ""appears"" on the audio commentary, and in the View Askew logo at the beginning and end of the film. Jersey Girl stars J-Lo, Jason Biggs (American Pie), the late George Carlin, and Raquel Castro in her film debut. The plot: A big time record producer must raise his daughter after his wife dies. Now, he's trying his best to be a good father to his daughter. It may be sad, but still funny at the same time. A good comedy-drama.

The story involves a man (Ben Afflack) who gets fired from a high-paying NYC publicity job for an unforgivable lapse in behavior and goes into the ranks of the unemployed and unemployable (in his field). Shortly before the firing his wife, and the love of his life, died during the birth of his little girl. He becomes a single parent. He moves to New Jersey and lives with his father for the next seven years as his little girl grows up, all the time trying in vain to get back to his glory NYC days. He meets another woman and they become friends. Finally, he gives up his NYC dream and makes peace with himself.

It's an engaging story and well done. It's overacted here and there. It's touching here and there. The filming and  sound are good. It's an easy going, relaxed, enjoyable movie, but no big deal.

Jennifer Lopez does well in a fairly brief role. George Carlin falls very naturally into his part. One supporting actor who deserves a lot of credit here, is Mike Starr. I don't want to give away too much of the plot here, but there is some good material about there being aspects of life which are more important than money. On the version of this I have, there are some very good extras, as well. For those who are Jay and Silent Bob fans, this is NOT anything like those movies.

2071326,5,B00029LO5O,"JERSEY GIRL stars Ben Affleck, who burst into the public's awareness as a co-star with Matt Damon in GOODWILL HUNTING.  JERSEY GIRL also stars George Carlin (famed comedian) as Mr. Affleck's crotchety father, Liv Tyler as the romance interest, and Raquel Castro as Mr. Affleck's 7 year old daughter.  Ms. Castro has acted in the films: Jersey Girl, Little Fugitive, Tracks of Color, The Ministers, America, Brooklyn's Finest.

THE PLOT.  In brief, the plot is about a successful, highly paid publicist (Mr. Affleck) working in New York City.  His wife is pregnant, but the delivery takes a bad turn, and Mr. Affleck winds up a widow with an infant child on his hands.  Mr. Affleck continues with his publicist job, perhaps for a month, but then commits career suicide because of a mild emotional outburst.  Following this, Mr. Affleck moves in with his father in a New Jersey town, located about a 1-hour drive from Manhattan, and obtains a job driving a street-sweeping truck. Fast-forward 7-years, and we find that Mr. Affleck and his daughter like to rent movies at the corner outlet.  At this outlet, Mr. Affleck meets the love interest (Liv Tyler).  And so on, and so forth.  Happy ending.

Does this sound predictable?  Does this sound like SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE? Or like perhaps something from KRAMER V. KRAMER?  Yes and no.  If the viewer detects any plot elements that have appeared in earlier films, the reason is that these elements are universal, and are worthy of re-telling.  The storyline does contain plot elements that are novel and clever.  These are easy to detect, for example, the amusing anatomy lesson scene between two children that is mirrored, later on in the film, by the equally amusing anatomy lesson scene between Mr. Affleck and Liv Tyler. Another clever nuance, involving irony, is Mr. Affleck's argument at a town council meeting that the city should go ahead with construction on the main street (but near the end of this film, the construction on the street backfires against Mr. Affleck, and impedes his ability to meet a pressing deadline).

GREAT RAPPORT.  JERSEY GIRL depicts father/daughter rapport better than most or perhaps all other films.  The nearest runner-up that comes to mind, is Tom Cruise's devotion to Dakota Fanning in WAR OF THE WORLDS.  Any father who has been a parent to a pre-teen girl will likely be mesmerized by this movie.  (To put things in perspective, this film is not really in the same class as other family films, such as MRS. DOUBTFIRE, or Tom Cruise's version of WAR OF THE WORLDS.  The reason is that JERSEY GIRL has lots of mild potty humor.)  FIVE STARS to JERSEY GIRL.",1292630400,4,2642,4.848214285714286
2071327,4,B00029LO5O,"JERSEY GIRL got kicked to the curb when it first came out, and maybe part of the rancor is because the film was perceived as a departure for writer/director Kevin Smith; his fans maybe were jonesing for yet more Jay and Silent Bob slacker hijinks. Instead JERSEY GIRL unfolds as an unabashedly sentimental family film. And then there was also some of that ""Bennifer"" backlash still being slung around. And the festering ghost of GIGLI. Having said that, you've gotta be some kind of hard core cynic to not be swayed even a little by this film. Kevin Smith went for the touchy feely stuff, and it worked, worked for me, anyway.

Jennifer Lopez is around for the film's first thirteen minutes, time enough for her to establish her character as the love of Oliver Trinke's life. She dies giving birth to their baby, Gertie. As Oliver, Ben Affleck sort of channels the 1980s Tom Cruise. He starts out as this happening, work-obsessed executive in the music industry, and he is an asshat of the first order. Ollie's life alters drastically with the passing of his wife, the birth of his daughter, the loss of his career in the fast lane (thanks, Fresh Prince). He moves back in with his blue-collar dad (George Carlin) in Jersey and joins him as part of the city's public works department.

Kevin Smith, when not doling out the frat boy humor, is pretty skilled at pushing that emotional button. He certainly did it in CHASING AMY and, here, he throws in the warm and the heartfelt, and yes it is just a bit mawkish. But I bought into it, and I'm not even a fan of Affleck. But he convinces me, his character after seven years still grieving for his dead wife, his utter devotion to his daughter Gertie. It helps that the kid is played so sweetly by Raquel Castro who makes her film debut and instantly lights up the screen. Castro and Affleck play off so well against each other that it's startling to learn (in Smith and Affleck's audio commentary) that she and Ben simply had no chemistry for the first few days of filming. Apparently, Raquel was wishing that, in the script, Ben had been the one to die during childbirth so she could act with JLo instead. The kid got over it.

Kevin Smith plonks in three love stories. There is Carlin and Affleck's father-son relationship, and Affleck and Liv Tyler's growing romance, and Liv, by the way, is really good as the sexy but goofy video store clerk. But the central thread is clearly the father-daughter relationship, and these two actors' interactions really strike a chord. The conflict - because I did say that Affleck was channeling Cruise ala 1980s - rises from Ollie Trinke still hankering for his former slick big city smooth operator ways, except how does he balance that yearning with his role as a father who truly adores his seven-year-old? The acting is good, so the predictability of the story and bits of heavy-handed moments don't drag things too badly. I even liked Kevin's take on that patented plot device of the father trying to get to his kid's big school production in time.

Since this is Kevin Smith, you of course also get exposed to jokes. The story, when it starts, is set back in 1994 and so Kevin injects several hindsight is 20/20 jokes (""George Michael is all about the ladies. 'I Want Your Sex'? That sound like he's singing to a guy?""). There's even one gag about the Fresh Prince that really pays off near the end. Lots of good lines, but my favorite is the school principal emceeing the fall pageant: ""First grader Gertrude Trinke and her grandfather will be performing what I can only assume is a hymn entitled ""God, That's Good"" from the musical Sweeney Todd."" Heh.

It's just a really good cast. If you're familiar with Geoge Carlin's stage persona, know that he doesn't do that here, he plays it gruff and straight and he's effective. The hilarious Stephen Root manages to steal plenty of scenes, even some of the scenes featuring the very cute Raquel Castro. Matt Damon and Jason Lee stop by for a funny cameo. Jason Biggs looks like a waxy mannequin on the DVD cover.

The DVD's sizable bonus material, some of which even pertains to this movie: Stream of consciousness audio commentary with Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck; another audio commentary with Kevin Smith, producer Scott Mosier and special guest Jason Mewes; ""From MALLRATS to JERSEY GIRL"" - Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck shoot the breeze and spend maybe two seconds mentioning this movie (00:27:08 minutes long); You also get five installments from The Tonight Show's ""Roadside Attractions"" segment hosted by Kevin Smith (including On the Set of JERSEY GIRL); the Behind-the-Scenes special (00:16:20); and really decent text interviews with the cast & crew.",1285372800,,4700,4.711678832116788

This is a film in which even the raunchy humor is cute.

And you know what? It works. It's moderately funny, well-paced, upbeat ... a pretty good evening's entertainment.

I just learned, this week, that I have one of those ""everybody-knows-everybody-within-the-sixth-degree"" connections to Ben Affleck. His mother, Christopher Ann (Chris) Boldt and I were good friends and classmates in college. I met young Ben once, when he was a teenager in Cambridge MS, and I saw him in ""Good Will Hunting"" without making the connection. But I couldn't remember what he looked like, so I went to my local video nook and asked the video-wallah which Ben Affleck film he would recommend. ""Jersey Girl"" was his pick. Huh.

A light-hearted comedy. It's a feel good movie that never takes itself too seriously, but is very entertaining.  A  very good and touching movie.

2071348,4,B00029LO5O,"""Jersey Girl"" is a great romantic comedy starring Ben Affleck as Ollie Trinke, a successful workaholic.  However, this film is sadder than most romantic comedies because Ollie loses his wife (Jennifer Lopez of ""The Wedding Planner and ""Maid in Manhattan) while she is giving birth to their daughter, Gertrude.  He later loses his career when he insults Will Smith who has a cameo in the movie.  Knocked off his lofty pedestal, Ollie is forced to humble himself by moving back home with his alcoholic father (super comedian George Carlin) and earn a living by cleaning streets.  Eventually he meets spunky video store clerk, played by the beautiful Liv Tyler (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy).

  Affleck and Tyler have been romantically paired together before.  They were lovers in the great disaster film ""Armageddon.""  Interesting enough, Liv Tyler's megastar father, Steve Tyler, sung the lead song for ""Armageddon,"" which was a very romantic ballad titled ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.""  In ""Jersey Girl,"" Liv Tyler sings part of a song from Sweeney Todd at Gertrude's school on talent night.  I didn't realize she could sing; it was a genuine treat.

  ""Jersey Girl"" reminded me of ""Raising Helen,"" which starred Kate Hudson as Helen Harris.  Helen is a fun-loving single who is forced to become a parent overnight when her sister and brother-in-law are accidentally killed.  Likewise, Ollie Trinke is forced to become a single parent when he isn't ready for the additional responsibility.

  Ollie Trinke reminded me of Drew Latham (also played by Ben Affleck) of ""Surviving Christmas.""  Drew is a rich, successful advertiser who learns that love and family are more important than wealth.  This lonely man tries to ""buy"" a family for the holidays.  He soon learns that you can't buy love.  Ollie Trinke also learns that money doesn't buy happiness.  It comes from being with your family.

  The ending for ""Jersey Girl"" reminded me of the one for ""Life or Something Like It.""  Angelina Jolie (in one of her better roles) is a successful reporter who is faced with a career decision that will take her away from friends and family.

  Overall, the movie was great.  The foul language could've been toned down.  The movie had some really sad, grim moments, but it had some hilarious ones as well.

He also did a great job acting in the movie Dogma.  It was refreshing seeing Ben Affleck in a more serious role and Jennifer Lopez was good in her role.

2071362,4,B00029LO5O,"I put off watching this film for a long time. I'd heard that, while it's a Kevin Smith movie, it's not a Kevin Smith movie, if you get me... so, I didn't want to see it, because I was afraid that it would somehow make me respect Smith less as a filmmaker. I guess I was afraid that, if he made a run-of-the-mill Hollywood romance comedy, it would call his artistic credentials into question and make him into a ""sell-out,"" whatever that means. I didn't want to see Jersey Girl because I'm a Kevin Smith fan.

Well, my fiancee convinced me to watch it with her the other night, and... turns out, it's actually really good. No, it's not the same style of hipper-than-thou dialogue-infused 'indie' flick that Smith is famous for. Yeah, it's a romantic comedy. But it shows off a lot of wit and heart and, if men must watch romantic comedies to please their significant others, then this kind of romantic comedy will fit the bill quite well.

The movie is about a savvy, slick public relations guy (Affleck) whose life is derailed when his wife dies giving birth to his daughter and the strain of it all causes him to lose his job. Moving in with his loving-crumudgeon of a father (Carlin), he finds some joy in raising his kid, becoming a maintenance worker and flirting with the local video-shop girl (Tyler), but deep down he still wants to get back to the New York jet-set life he once had.

Again, not your standard Kevin Smith-fare, but Smith makes it resonate with truth, and fun, and interest, and, in the end, watching this movie didn't make me think less of Smith, but more of him for such a display of versatility.

With the woman you love, or on your own, a very good movie to watch.

2071383,5,B00029LO5O,"I suppose I never really had any problem with Ben Affleck because I never paid any attention to his public figure (plus, he's in some of my favorite movies)- or really, to anyone. Jennifer Lopez, though, you can't get away without seeing (at least, at the time); I really don't like her much. As said, she dies very soon, which is a plus.

He really is an excellent actor; while he has, in most of the Kevin Smith films he acts, had a similar feel about him down the the general facial expressions he makes, I believe this is more of a byproduct of Smith's personal desire to link all the films. On the bright side, I like the facial expressions and eye movements he makes; they're usually pretty sarcastic, which sits well with me.

In this movie, he is really very good, reacting to many things the way a real person his age would, not a strictly formulaic on-screen father.

The real star though, of course, is his daughter. Impossibly adorable, very sharp, and, it seems, a bit manipulative, she has an amazing presence. And as mentioned in the editorial, she is a dead ringer for Lopez, which is sort of mind-blowing- of course at the same time, this girl is the kind you really want to see succeed, whereas Lopez you just sort of want to go away. The truly brilliant portion of it is that she actually comes off as highly intelligent and inquisitive; while this is obviously a movie, it's not one of those know-it-all kids with the glasses who you can clearly see doesn't have the faintest idea of what he (or she) is actually saying. She doesn't seem to be just reciting a script, she actually gets it. And that really sets her apart from kids her age.

George Carlin, contrary to his usual sarcastic/screw the children role, plays a loving grandfather, if a bit rough around the edges; this is truly refreshing, because while I do love Carlin, I feel he sometimes needs to be a bit... nicer. He does just that.

Affleck's love interest, as he so aptly puts it is ""an incredibly strange woman..."" who despite yourself you begin to like (though, really only after having watched it twice).

All in all, a truly compelling performance all around; Kevin Smith showed this movie again last year with some changes at his annual festival, and apparently it was very well-received, even by critics. From looking at the changes and how very minor they are, the real reason this movie was so poorly received, I suspect, has much more to do with the whole ""Benniffer"" thing.

This movie was soul-suckingly bad.  Apocalypse bad.  Suicide bad.  Pauly Shore bad.  Give me a paper cut and rub lemon juice in it bad. It was bad.

Here are the good things about the movie:

1.  J-Lo dies in the first ten minutes.

2. Ben Affleck was NOT the suckiest thing about the movie.

3. It was not that long.

Here are the sucky things:

1. It stars a bizarre-looking little urchin girl.  I don't know if you ever saw ""Twin Peaks"" or the HBO series ""Carnevale"" but it stars a dwarf named Michael J Anderson.  If you put a long brown wig on him and dressed him up like a little girl, he would be a twin of this little vixen.  She was a revolting little toad, a bad actress, and a worse singer. She sucked my soul.

2. The print was hideous, and this is from a movie not even released yet.  Even though it had Vilmos Zsigmond, a fine cinematographer, it looked like each reel was from a different movie, and not a very good movie.  At times it was green, washed out, over exposed, and just visually painful. A little bit of my soul was lost here.

3.  The editing SUCKED.  It ripped out the shreds of what was left of my soul, and the souls of my ancestors. I could see my soul leaving my body and floating up to the ceiling of the theater as I silently screamed.

4.  The movie reeked of false sentimentality. If the scriptwriter got paid by the cliche he would be the highest paid man in Hollywood and possibly the world. This screenwriter should be shot, hung, poisoned, drowned, and then killed.  Oh wait...Kevin Smith was the screenwriter.  Mr. Parent Boy wrote the screenplay to celebrate the joy he feels at being a father.  Note to Kevin: Not so much share those feelings with others in the future; I want my soul back.

In short, I am not so much recommending this movie.",1146700800,8,1841,4.260869565217392
2071385,5,B00029LO5O,"What a great film written and directed by Mr. Kevin Smith. Ben Affleck actually does a really good job in this movie about a man who has to raise his daughter alone since his wife dies giving birth. The only help he has raising his daughter is his dad, played by George Carlin. It's a touching movie that is funny at parts, and even sad at others. The film also features J-Lo for a few minutes at the beginning of the film; obviously this was during the time of the two dating. Most of the regular view askew actors are in this film; George Carlin, Ben Affleck and Jason Lee to name a few. There is an absence of Jay and Silent Bob, but I guess Kevin thought having the two on the film would have taken away the seriousness of the film. Ben's relationship with his daughter in the film is what caries the film all the way to the end. You can tell that he is a very caring and loving dad and you get the feeling that Kevin Smith wrote the movie after having experience being a dad to his own daughter. This isn't like the other View Askew films, pure drama done the Kevin Smith way and it really works. Just don't expect the usual comedy of Kevin Smith in this film like you would find in a Jay and Silent Bob movie, it's not here because it's not that kind of film.",1146182400,,1265,4.125506072874494

Okay, you know the basic plot.  Guy falls in love with girl, girl gets pregnant, they have baby, girl dies giving birth.  Guy, now, Father is a workaholic, who uses work to forget his wife's death, and neglects his daughter.  Guy gets fired and spends the next seven years working on a road crew with his day and living with his dad in New Jersey.  He moved from Manhattan to New Jersey.  Let's all give the guy a break, here, folks.  That might have killed a lesser man.

Then, when his daughter is seven, he gets the chance to go back to a job like his old one, but realizes, if he does, things with his daughter are going to change and he will no longer have as much time for her.  he has a hard choice to make.

Okay, this is best of anything Kevin Smith has done so far.  usually his characters loll around and talk.  They talk so much you fall asleep.  Give us some action, Kevin, you say, not some heavy handed dialouge where the characters act as mouthpieces for you.  And for once in his directing career, he did.

Don't listen to the critics.  This is worth a watch or two.",1137542400,3,1351,4.2109375
2071387,4,B00029LO5O,"Jersey girl is a sweet and funny movie directed by Kevin Smith (Clerks), and starring Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler (both previously appeared together in Armageddon), comedian George Carlin, and American Pie's Jason Biggs.

The story is about a New York music executive named Ollie Trinke who loses his wife, played by Jennifer Lopez, while she is giving birth to their first child, a girl he names Gertrude after her deceased mother.

Under stress and frustration due to his current situation and lack of fatherly experiences, Ollie also loses his job after he trashes his biggest client, ""Fresh Prince"" Will Smith, in front of reporters. He moves in with his father, played by Carlin, in Jersey as a result.

7 years later, Ollie is still unemployed and struggling as a single parent to 7 year old Gertie, played by Raquel Castro. He meets Maya, a video store clerk played by Tyler, and they both hit it off. Ollie is also trying to a find a way back into show business.

The story's dillemma is whether or not Ollie should get a job and lose the fruitful relationship he has going with his daughter, or sacrifice that to being a full time father.

Despite being corny and seemingly a cliche movie, and Ben Affleck's bad acting, Jersey Girl is delightful! I honestly found myself enjoying the film even though I don't usually do that with stories that offer nothing new or actors I dislike.

Watch out for cameo appearances by Jason Lee, Matt Damon, and the fresh prince himself, Will Smith.

I think that the critics and people that do not like Kevin Smith (yes I think that they are one in the same) passed on this one just because it was a KS project.

The movie is about a guy who has his world turned upside down and tries to get back to his idea of normal, however, along the way he finds out what is really important.  Granted there is crude language, etc. butits use is pretty realistic in my view.  The story is good and the cast is excellent (especially George Carlin).

The music that was used cues up pefectly with the story.  The music director was inspired when it came to selections.

This is an all around good one, although not one for the kids.

2071390,4,B00029LO5O,"If this film came out by any other writer/director, people would have really liked if not loved it.  I'm not a huge Ben Affleck fan and I've never seen Jennifer Lopez in anything longer than a movie trailer.  I am a big Kevin Smith fan though.

The dialog was snappy and genuine, the acting was surprisingly understated and moving and while it was a little predictable as to where Ollie's (Affleck) journey was taking him, it was  done in a way that was surprisingly funny, disarming and touching.  Liv Tyler is more expressive than she's ever been on film, Ben Affleck is more conflicted and more vulnerable than I've ever seen him and George Carlin gives a surprisingly nuanced performance as Ollie's imperfect, loving, alcoholic father.  Jennifer Lopez' small contribution to the film is fine.  Affleck and Lopez do a fine job convincing the audience that they were in love, so when her character leaves the film, Ollie's heartbreak feels genuine.  Why cast Jennifer Lopez?  Well, in part, she gives Ollie's time in New York a fantasy-like quality and when her pop star-like beauty is gone, Ollie's world genuinely does seem a little less bright.

Jersey Girl is a modern film about modern themes in the old Frank Kapra style.

Why was this film panned?  Is it because Kevin Smith's fans are all under 20 or because we can't stand to see people make something sincere and different after we've made up our mind's about them?

Kevin Smith, like most of us, has grown up.  He's still the foul mouthed comic genius he always was, but he's something else too.  This film suffers, not from lack of quality or poor execution, but from a shallow public perception.  Who knew that Kevin Smith, creator of Jay and Silent Bob could make something unflinchingly heart warming?  The saddest thing about this film is that he's taken such a beating over making it that he'll never make another one like it.

Open your mind and forget the hype.  This is a good little film.",1134864000,6,1961,4.697947214076247
2071411,2,B00029LO5O,"Ben Affleck (Dogma, Phantoms) stars as Ollie, whose wife Gertrude, played by, well you guessed it, Jennifer Lopez (Out Of Sight, The Cell), dies while after giving birth to their daughter and Affleck names her Gertrude after her mother. Affleck is this big music industry publist who loses his job after saying that the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air will make an appearance but Will Smith doesnt show up. So, years later, after Affleck loses his job he's living with his pop, played by George Carlin (Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and his daughter Gertrude, played by the adorable Raquel Castro, is now 7 years old. Affleck meets video store clerk Liv Tyler (Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and they hitch it off. A big disappointment for Kevin Smith who's always so good at writing this stuff but it, for me, didn't really go anywhere. The opening sequence with the kids in class telling about their parents was a funny scene, one of a few in this movie. Will Smith (Independence Day, Ali) shows up later and their's brief cameos by Matt Damon (Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy) and Jason Lee (Tv's My Name Is Earl, A Guy Thing) as well...but the 3 cameos don't even help that the film doesnt work and yeah, well, all I can say for Lopez is she cant act....and please don't crack a laugh when she dies (said with sarcastic chuckle)Also starring Mike Starr (Tv's ED, Dumb and Dumber), Stephen Root (Office Space, Tv's New Radio) and Jason Biggs (Anything Else, Loser).

2071412,5,B00029LO5O,"Jersey Girl is something new for writer/director/star Kevin Smith and, opening to credits, it's his first big-name all-""serious"" flick, and it's wonderful. 10/10 material, in this reviewer's opinion. As stated elsewhere, this movie would have been box office gold if not for the media circus surrounding ""Bennifer"" before its release.

Jersey Girl stars Ben Affleck as Oliver Trinke (Trink-ee), a successful young publicist who falls in love with Jennifer Lopez (er, her character Gertrude Steiney). Tragedy ensues, and not to spoil the moment, but Affleck must raise their daughter as a single parent. Trinke's stress at having to be a single parent drives him to explode at work during a critical press conference, and he loses his job. Now depressed by both the loss of his job and his single parent status, Trinke must find a way to deal with life and love once again as he seeks out a new place for himself in the world.

Liv Tyler makes a splendid performance as a sort of love interest for Ollie, and it's a credit to Smith that Tyler looks so good. Somehow, he made all the makeup artists calm down and just let Tyler look like her natural self- it's a breath of fresh air, and goes a long way to showing how down to earth this movie really is. Look out for Will Smith in a wonderful cameo that's set up perfectly by events in the movie, and George Carlin in the most endearing role I've ever seen him in. There are actually a few near- tearjerker moments delivered by Carlin, a sort of range I've never seen from him before.

But the movie is really about Ollie's (Affleck's) relationship with his child Gertrude (""Gertie"")- played by the amazing Raquel Castro. Castro is amazing in her role, and looks perfect as the offspring of Affleck and Lopez- something few movies of this sort ever manage. She's adorable, and she's perfect in her part. Also look out for baby Gertie. I usually HATE this sort of 'chick flick' movie in general, but I was cooing out loud at the wonderfully cute moments in this flick. Again, no spoilers, but there's one scene in particular with baby Gertie and Affleck that won't leave a dry eye in the house, nor fail to put a smile on each and every face. Cinema gold.

Many people will comment that the ideas in this movie are rehashed. A father feels out of place raising kid alone, father tries to get back to his life, conflict arises, ho-hum. But there's something more to that- this story doesn't just recycle ideas, it uses them. Sure, the plot elements have been seen before, but what movie doesn't? You know the action hero's going to get the girl, and you know he'd going to save the day, but you pay for a movie ticket because you want to be entertained on the way there. This movie accomplishes that in spades.

In short: Lots of the performances in this movie should have been Oscar contenders in this reviewer's opinion, even if this flick really is just a light family story in the end (baby Gertie scene!). Affleck demonstrates that his bad name in the press really is undeserved, and Raquel Castro is the perfect daughter to Affleck's Trinke. Marred by Bennifer, and disrespected by former Smith loyals who expected something more crude, this flick may never see the credit that it deserves. Do yourself a favor, round up the kids/spouse/signifigant other, and enjoy this dazzling flick with a box of Kleenex handy. Truly amazing.",1127606400,57,3382,4.667785234899329

George Carlin is wonderful as Bart, and Raquel Castro is such a sweetheart as little Gertie. The chemistry between Affleck & Tyler is wonderful. The only reason I don't think this deserves 5 stars is because Lopez can't act and the director could've cast somebody better.

2071417,5,B00029LO5O,"Yes, I am a Kevin Smith fan. Yes, I love all of his films (even Mallrats). This film is no exception. First, this movie has one of the best writer/director/producer team in recent history with Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier. These two have pumped out several great movies and this is one of them. This is a very simple premise. Kevin Smith makes good movies. He is creative, he writes snappy dialog, and he is funny. From Clerks to Mallrats, from Chasing Amy to Dogma and back again to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back --- his movies are very solid.

Now, I am clearly a fan of the View Askew universe, and Jersey Girl clearly is not a part of that world (appearances from Ben Affleck and George Carlin notwithstanding) --- and it is extremely obvious that the ""essence"" of Jersey Girl is somewhat formulaic --- family unit disrupted by tragedy, self-centered character Affleck is forced to become a father to young daughter, and is ultimately redeemed and made whole through the love of his daughter and in theory, the intervention of the Liv Tyler character as his new love interest. Kevin Smith will continue to justify his work as a director of movies. Now did Kevin finally ""sell out?"" Well, I'd say he's maturing (being a family man and all) and leave it at that.

Any Kevin Smith fan who has seen his movies, his College Tour video `An Evening with Kevin Smith' and his interviews, knows that this is a guy who is more like us (the everyday person) than anyone else in Hollywood.  That being said, it was only a matter of time before he grew up.

Some people have said that if Jersey Girl had been released before that other god-awful Bennifer movie, it would have done better.  I have to believe that is true, mainly because Gigli given so much bad critism it seemed to carry over into Ben's next four films, the poor guy cannot get a break.

In any case, Jersey Girl should be looked individually.  Ben and Jen actually do have good chemistry and they both CAN act.  Affleck probably gives one of his better performances playing Oliver Trinke, a very successful young music Publicist who meets, falls in love with, and marries another publicist, Gertrude Steiney (Lopez).  They seem destined for bliss as they go through marriage, a pregnancy and finally the birth.  Then, tragedy; Ollie is forced to raise their daughter himself.

Despite the appearance of Liv Tyler who seems romantically interested in Ollie, this movie really is not a romantic comedy.  It's about the father and daughter relationship.  Ollie finds the father within himself at first but is later faced with the conflict of possibly getting his old lifestyle back and disrupting the rest of his family.

Kevin Smith has done wonders with this movie.  He has grown in leaps and bounds as a director.  His style has evolved to incorporate different camera angles and perspectives, something he was criticized for a lot in the past.  His story telling is much deeper and personal.  Despite this, the movie isn't without flaws.  Nothing you can put your finger on, but the concepts are borrowed and reshaped in Smith's image, which is ok.  There are only a so many plot lines in the world and this one has been done to death.  However, Smith has certainly done everything to keep the movie from falling into the clich trap.  With great dialogue moments that are distinctively Kevin Smith, a good story, a cameo by Will Smith and personal touch of growth, Jersey Girl is his Smith's doorway and proof that he can do more than Lesbian/Religious/Quickie Mart/Fart and Burp movies...not that there is anything wrong with those movies, I hear `Passion of the Clerks' in the pipe.",1113782400,6,2407,4.779661016949152

In the sensitive-man comedy ""Jersey Girl,"" Ben Affleck plays a Type-A public relations exec in Manhattan whose young wife (Jennifer Lopez) dies in childbirth, leaving him to raise their newborn daughter on his own.  Overwhelmed with grief, Ollie is at first unable to provide the fatherly love and attention his little girl needs and deserves.  However, when he loses his job, Ollie realizes that it is she who must come first in his life, so he moves in with his father in New Jersey and takes a maintenance job with the city.  Fast forward some seven years to find Ollie and Gertie leading a relatively idyllic existence, except that Ollie has chosen to remain celibate all that time.  Enter Maya, a madcap video store proprietor who slowly but surely reawakens his interest in carnal and romantic relationships.

Although the movie has a certain sweetness and charm at times, ""Jersey Girl"" is pretty thin, standard-issue stuff, with the screenplay too often deflecting into sitcom silliness and feel-good sappiness.  It even succumbs to the single hoariest clich in films about parent/child relationships: the old will-daddy-make-it-in-time-for-the-kid's-school-pageant scene.  Yet, oddly enough, just as you're about to give up on it, the film redeems itself by sneaking in a wonderful scene - like the one featuring Will Smith in a quick cameo as himself - right under our radar screen.  Affleck's former flame, J Lo, and former writing partner, Matt Damon, also put in brief appearances.

Affleck makes for a relatively bland central character, although Liv Tyler lights up the screen as Maya, the young woman who brings romance back into his life.  As the little girl, Raquel Castro is only occasionally cloying and sometimes even rather appealing, but George Carlin is essentially wasted in the nothing role of Ollie's pragmatic, advice-dispensing father.  I mean, who wants to see George Carlin, known for his iconoclasm and willingness to push the envelope, playing the levelheaded, practical person in any scenario?!

2071432,4,B00029LO5O,"Kevin Smith's new film 'Jersey Girl' is, it seems, quite unfairly attacked because of the following two factors: One, they say, Kevin went soft; and Two, yes, ""Bennifer,"" a curious word that is now almost forgotten among us.  But I enjoyed watching this sweet romantic comedy for what it is, and Kevin Smith, now himself married, also has a right to pick up father-daughter relation in his movies, doesn't he?  And Raquel Castro, 'Jersey Girl' of the film, is so cute.

Ben Affleck is very effective as Ollie Trinkle, workaholic New York publicist who lost his wife (Jennifer Lopez) at childbirth.  After the career-killing fiasco (at his job promoting 'second-rate star' Will Smith), Ollie comes back to his hometown in New Jersey, where he starts a new life with his only daughter Gertie (very pretty Raquel Castro with uncanny resemblance with J-Lo).

The basic story does not offer anything original except its tiny details.  Ollie picks up his daughter at school riding his 'Bat Mobile' (actually an old road cleaning vehicle).  Ollie meets a new love (a girl named Maya, played by Liv Tyler) at a rental video shop.  Gertie loves her life in New Jersey, and so does Maya, and Ollie's father (George Carlin) too, but Ollie still wants the glorious days of NYC.

Though Kevin Smith did not use the controversial materials like religion, 'Jersey Girl' is nowhere near a family-oriented picture.  If Ollie and Gertie see a Broadway musical, it's not 'Cats' nor 'Starlight Express'; no, it should be Sondheim's 'Sweeny Todd,' tale about a cut-throating barber and delicious meat pies.  And at Ollie's home, the kids are showing their 'parts' to each other.

Ben Affleck fits in the role of likeable single father quite naturally, and it is also fun to see him and his daughter exchanging humorous dialogues with each other.  Wide-eyed and long-haired Raquel Castro is incredibly cute, and the casting agent who found her deserves a special bonus.  Her charming smile raises the film's quality one notch up, or perhaps more.  You also get amusing cameos from Matt Damon, Jason Lee, and Will Smith.

'Jersey Girl' is sweet, often too sentimental, and least Kevin Smith-like film.  You find few references to comics and pop culture, so his faithful fans might be disappointed at the change.

While Gertie is still an infant, Ollie destroys his publicity career during at a promotional event for Will Smith (which leads to a fun cameo later in the movie).

The acting is well done all around especially by Affleck, Liv Tyler and the little girl that plays his daughter Raquel(?). The jokes were consistantly funny mostly because of the great acting. There are some moments of seriousness but it blends seamlessly with the humour. Good editing (very important IMO!) and nice soundtrack also add points for this movie.

The story was a typical one, but it was full of not-so-typical characters and events.  George Carlin (who I'm not usually a fan of) was fabulous as the gruff father/doting grandfather, and Liv Tyler was wonderful as a kind of strange but good hearted girl-next-door.  The girl who played little Gertie was oustanding - she could have made the entire movie by herself!  But it was Ben Affleck I was most surprised by.  Sure, he's cute and sure, he's made some decent movies, but I've never really considered him a good actor.  This movie changed my mind, however.

I'm a huge Ben Affleck fan and I was hoping that after Jersey Girls things might look up for his career I only was disappointed by this poor family flick. The storyline is predictable and horrible at the same time going from Ben's attempted mercy hump to him showing up unexpectadley at his daughter's school show. Ben Affleck dosn't seem to connect with the little girl much and Liv Tyler the fairy from lord of the rings does a horrible job as Ben's love interest. The laughs stop after Ben denounces rising star Will Smith. This is not the cute family flick to watch with your kids.

Another boring part in this movie is the camera work that focus just on the faces with no angles or anything you kind of get bored. Not to mention Ben's soap operetic moments- such as when he is talking to his baby daughter about her dead mother-- you feel bad for how bad the movie is. My cousins were falling asleep half-way through it. Although, I did like the critcism of Cats(one of my least favorite musicals)

2071451,1,B00029LO5O,"I had the unfortunate experience of being forced to sit through ""Jersey Girl"" while en route from New York City to Boston via bus.

Despite being a huge fan of Kevin Smith, I had no desire to see this.  Not even his genius could make J.Lo and Ben Affleck palatable.

Basic premise: Affleck and his giant head play Ollie Trinke (yes, Ollie Trinke), a man obsessed with his career as a publicist.  He falls in love with Gertie, played by J.Lo, whose hair makes the movie even more annoying.  They get married, Gertie gets pregnant, and everything seems to be falling into place until complications during childbirth lead to Gertie's untimely death and J.Lo's thankful exit from the film early on.

Ollie, unable to deal with the loss of his wife and having to deal with a baby on his own, falls apart.  Because he is frantic and stressed, he loses his job.  He has to move out to Jersey with his father, played by George Carlin, who he assumes will raise his child.

Flash forward - Gertie, Ollie's daughter, is 7 years old and played by the unbearably adorable Raquel Castro.  Ollie has miraculously turned into a good and attentive father.  While renting a movie, Ollie meets Maya, played by Liv Tyler, who is a graduate student working in the video store.

Hijinks ensue.  There is a musical number.  There are botched forays into the sentimental.  There is unconvincing romance.

I have no idea why Maya was into Affleck's character.  Yes, Castro makes Affleck more appealing, but one dimensional Affleck plays the character either smugly or devoid of emotion.  Yet she is rabid.  Makes no sense.

Affleck's performance is inconsistent and unconvincing, except for the portion at the beginning where he is playing the arrogant and self-obsessed publicist.

Smith's oversimplified journey into the saccharine falls flat in the hands of Affleck.

The movie ends up being pure sap and mostly bland.",1106092800,11,1897,4.826086956521739
2071452,4,B00029LO5O,"This is a comedy that does not present the viewer with novel ideas and that does not use innovative ways to make us laugh. But, even though the plot may be trite, the outstanding Raquel Castro, in her role of Gertie, gives a freshness to this film that makes it worth watching. This little girl captivates the hearts of the viewers, and allows us to enjoy the time spent on this otherwise average comedy.

Ollie Trinke (Ben Affleck) is a successful New York publicist working for the music industry. One day he meets Gertrude (Jennifer Lopez), a serious business woman, who right away makes him fall for her. Everything happens quickly; Ollie takes Gertrude to Jersey to meet his father (George Carlin) and then asks her to marry him, getting her pregnant that same night. Things are going great, the couple is in love, they keep up with their busy lives and they are fashionably late for every event they have to participate in. Everything turns south though when Gertrude dies after an aneurysm she carried ruptures during labor.

Ollie cannot deal with the situation and asks his father, Bart, to take care of the baby. But Bart is not willing to keep it up for long, and Ollie finds himself with a baby under his care and out of a job. That is when he decides to be the best father in the world, and seven years later he is working sweeping the streets of Jersey with his father and trying to get back in the world of publicity.

Besides Raquel Castro, I found the performances of George Carlin (I love this guy's humor) and Liv Tyler to be particularly good. I consider myself lucky by the fact that Tyler got the role of Maya, a graduate student who works in a video store and meets Ollie and Gertie during one of their trips for movies.

I honestly expected this film to be a romantic comedy when I rented it. Instead its a long tedious drama filled with Ollie's brow-beating and self-centered behavior. I found Ollie's love interest (the video clerk), to be quite annoying. The little kid was a good actor and reminds me of Alyssa Milano at that age.

I can't honestly recommend this flick. I was bored and wanted to see Ollie's character come around a lot sooner. Instead, he was a total loser until the very end.

2071473,2,B00029LO5O,"""Jersey Girl"" was vastly overshadowed by the presence of ex-lovers Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. But I don't think that Lopez's complete absence would have saved this mediocre, unfunny romantic comedy by Kevin Smith. Liv Tyler sparkles in her scenes, but Affleck's usual blandness permeates the paint-by-numbers script.

Ollie (Ben Affleck) is a successful publicist, and he finds true love when he falls in love with Gertrude Steiney (Jennifer Lopez). But during the birth of their child, Gertrude dies of an aneurysm. Heartbroken, Ollie develops a short fuse, and launches into a Will Smith-related rant during a press conference for Will Smith. He's fired. Fast-forward seven years (in which Affleck doesn't age at all).

Ollie is still lonely and unhappy, and looking for new work so he can support Gertie Jr. (Raquel Castro). He runs into Maya (Liv Tyler), a budding sexology major who asks him masturbation questions. Despite the awkwardness, Ollie gets to know the beautiful Maya better, and learns that he can fall in love a second time...

During the filming and release of this movie, all the hype was on ""Ben and Jen -- Together Again!"" (P.R. poetry). This left female lead Liv Tyler to stand in the shadows. It's a shame, because Tyler is one of the few bright points of this tepid film. Unfortunately, not her presence nor the massive hype could keep this from flopping like a convulsing fish.

Basically, ""Jersey Girl's"" biggest flaw is that it's formulaic -- after Gertrude dies, viewers will be able to guess every single plot development, right up to the ending. Smith gives it a few twists, like Maya's weird sexual moments, but these feel like they were pasted in to give the script an edge. And the humor is the stuff of sitcoms, like Gertie finding Maya and Ollie in the shower. It feels like Smith wasn't really trying, as if he were getting a bit lazy.

Ben Affleck displays the charisma and acting presence of a Ken doll. Nuff zed. Liv Tyler distances herself from elf Arwen by playing a naughty girl who learns about the sweeter side of men; it's a weird role, but Tyler makes it surreally charming. Lopez appears just long enough to be annoying, and her mini-me Raquel Castro displays the irritating cutesiness that 99% of child stars have.

A predictable romantic comedy that isn't very funny, ""Jersey Girl"" is redeemed mainly by a few fitful comic moments, and Tyler's weirdly charming Maya. Otherwise, it's just another bland movie to watch when all the good ones are taken.",1097712000,3,2505,4.868544600938967

2071475,2,B00029LO5O,"I started the film with the feeling that I was going to see the 1000th romantic comedy of the year. Affleck and Lopez together again, but wasn't Liv Tyler the main female character?

After a good start, the first strange thing arises: JLo is out of the film in 15 minutes! Is this good or bad news? Her removal was the beginning of a set of dreadful scenes. The worst of it: the never-ending Affleck's monologue in front of his baby splashed of useless spots of the child's sunrise and the grandfather (Goerge Carlin) nodding every of his son's words.

Then, we discover the truth: neither Lopez nor Tyler is the star, but Raquel Castro. This is the really Jersey Girl and not one of the adults. So the first fifteen minutes were useless. Besides, Affleck's role (Ollie) is becoming more convincent and Raquel's acting is marvellous and this is what make the film not deserve a ""failure"" with only one star.

Aftherwards, the ""late entry"" of Liv Tyler (Maya) in the movie is too abrupt, as well as the terrible fight between the girl and his father. More abrupt is Will Smith's cameo (why has he got to speak so bad about himself?).

The worst thing is not the story itself, but some scenes which are totally unjustifiable. The film is sexually spotless unless for two minutes. The film is orally spotless unless for the resturant dialogue between Maya and Ollie. And the worst of the worst is the way she enters in Ollie's life: A pre-doctoral sexologist in a video-store? A first-view questionnaire about masturbation which encovers a sexual attraction for a widower? Too strange.

The film should be easily re-oriented to a family comedy from a romantic comedy cutting the first 15 minutes and the mother's death, some out-of-tone words and the shower and the restaurant scenes.

The director had a dilemma. It had to be clear that Ollie was a workaholic and that he hated his new job. So there had to be some scenes of his past life with her wife before the child was born. How could he do it? Well, I am not a movie director...

Well, actors saved the film and at least made this a decent film to watch. I think Affleck never did it so good, but this is not a reason to recommend this movie.",1097280000,3,2196,4.53030303030303
2071476,5,B00029LO5O,"If you are really so closeminded as to believe that Kevin Smith should closet himself into the writing and directing the same type of movies as he has previously made, than do not watch this film.  If you are a truly open minded person who believes a person should grow and expand their horizons who is also a Kevin Smith fan, watch away.

This is a great film with a good if somewhat predictable story line.  Smith's touches and editorial view are all over this movie and live true to the View Askew philosophy (which is to say taking something and viewing it slightly differently).  There are a lot of meatheads out there who are expecting Kevin to stay in the same mode of thought and creation as he has been previously with the exception of Chasing Amy, which i am sure the same critics impunged with magnamous hatred.  Open your mind and your view of life.  Please.  Do you really expect a man as brilliant as Mr. Smith to pigeonhole himself into only one aspect of the widely varying influences he projects into his movies?  If your answer is yes, please find a new director to watch.

While I am not the biggest Ben Affleck fan and find his acting rather lacking in many pivotal scenes, I do believe he is a great actor for this leading role.  His self-centeredness definitely projects onto the screen and that is the essence of Ollie Trinke.  Critics, deal with it.

Raquel Castro is a brilliant young actress with a presence and personality uncommon in children.  George Carlin's role may not be what people expect, but in the context of the film as a whole, it is wholly and totally appropriate and keeping with his character.  Liv Tyler's role is also not what I believe most people were expecting.  She plays a sexually rambunctious college student who is learning the sentimental side of men.  Deal with it.

If you have seen any of Smith's movies previously and liked them and you have an open mind or would like to watch a movie with true sentiment, please watch this and enjoy.

If you are expecting Kevin Smith's normal type of film, then snootchy your bootchies somewhere else.",1097020800,3,2095,4.571045576407506
2071487,1,B00029LO5O,"The first was, not to jump on the film critic bandwagon, Jersey Girl.  For those of you that know me, I am normally one that will give a film the benefit of the doubt before jumping onto the bandwagon with the rest of the critics.  Normally, this is how you find some great films.  You get past what those that are paid to speak highly or negatively about a film say and you watch it yourself.  That is why I had to rent Jersey Girl before I could fully say that it was a bad film.  So, I watched it, and well ... it was a bad film.  Have you ever seen those documentary nature programs that slow down time to show you exactly where the prey went wrong before the predator captured it?  I think I can pinpoint exactly when Kevin Smith's decision to make Jersey Girl was bad.  I don't even think I need slow motion.  The fact that he used, not only J-Lo and Bennifer in the same scenes (during their moments of glory together), but he also used America's favorite ""hug-able"" actor, Will Smith to play the part of Bennifer's conscious.  It was a low blow for us Clerks fanatics and a lower blow for Smith (whichever one you wish to choose).  I always believe that you should try something before making your decision, but with this film ... I say skip it and return back to a time when Smith (again, either one) was funny and his style of filmmaking was all his own.

I can now officially say that Kevin Smith has sold out.  I was worried with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back that too much money would make him greedy and forget his roots.  I was slightly wrong because Strike Back did make me laugh and continued with his hysterical developed characters.  We have grown up with Kevin from his first film all the way until his recent release of Jersey Girl, and I must say that if I were a best friend of the man, I would have to slap him across the face.  What happened with this film?  When did it become cool for a very independent and radical director step forward and make a film that was nothing more than a refurbished Hollywood production.  I have seen films like this before, and I never thought I would live to see the day when Kevin Smith's name would be attached to one.  I understand that he wanted to give praise to his father, but by going outside of his patented signature design is not paying your full respects.  This was a classic case of Hollywood handing Smith more money than he knew what to do with and Smith bowing down to the masses.  I argue about this in so many other films that it really saddens me to see Smith fall into this category.  Where has Kevin Smith gone?

So, where are the problems in this film?  Will Smith is a major one.  It was completely unnecessary to use America's favorite actor to be the Jimminy Cricket of the film.  I saw that scene coming from a mile away.  The only people who were shocked were the teenie-boppers in the front that just love Will Smith.  It nearly made me want to vomit.  Where was the Kevin Smith humor, the intellectual conversation, or even the audio jokes?  Nothing that made Kevin Smith the director he is today was in this film.  I realize that he wanted to get away from the world he created with Clerks, but did he need to abandon all that was good and sacred and literally sell his soul to corporate Hollywood?  I was hoping that the answer would be ""no"", but sadly it was ""yes"".

Add to bad direction and an uncreative story some bad actors and you have Jersey Girl pretty much summed up.  I first had the feeling (within the first twenty minutes) that this could be a drama and perhaps it was marketed incorrectly, but that was blown away when Gertrude grew up and there was that classic ""running to save someone"" scene near the end.  Affleck was horrible as the crying guy that is full of rage and emotion.  I hate when actors cry and there is just one tear coming from one eye.  This was yet another cliched moment brought to you by Kevin Smith.  Lopez was horrible and one-dimensional.  She was a pivotal point to this film, she could have at least tried acting for once.  George Carlin was boring.  He just wasn't as funny as I thought he was going to be.  The cameos were interesting, but nothing to write home about.  Then we have Liv Tyler.  Smith possibly made the worst choice ever to cast her as the female leading role.  Her randomly sexual moments seemed forced and uncollected.  Her connection with Affleck was completely Hollywood and the chemistry seemed to be concocted by leftover Meg Ryan films.  How can a director say that he wants to move away from the Clerks world, yet still use actors that were all his other films?  It just didn't work.  In fact, I can safely say that nothing worked in this film.

If you are a fan of recycled Hollywood films, this is possibly going to be your homerun for the evening.  If you are a fan of Smith and are looking for any redeeming value, do not see Jersey Girl.

Shame on you Kevin Smith.  I deserve money back on this film.

I went into this movie knowing that Jennifer Lopez dies during child birth, but was still really sad when it happened. Watching Affleck go from happy, to concerned, to confused, to freaking out was really cool. I think that's about the same way I would have acted except I would be busting out crying. I really don't know how I would act towards that kid either. I for one would probably act the way Ben was towards her. But then get over it and start being a father like I should. After it going to her being seven years old, it even got better. You see he's become a pretty good loving and responsible father. He doesnt care about dating or just even meeting women, cause he has Gerty in his life and that's the only woman he ever needs. But then comes along Liv Tyler, who plays a cute nerdy chick at the video rental store. She breaks through his shell and helps him, I think, begin to get over his wife. The movie had some very funny parts in it..such as the 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours' part.

As for the DVD, make sure you watch Kevin Smiths road trips. And the interview with Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck. Once again...when Ben and Kevin get in the same room together, prepare for laughter.

I've never been a huge fan of Ben Affleck but I thought he played his role pretty well.  I think I cried about five different times while watching this movie.  Even though there were quite a few emotional scenes, they were well enough mixed with funny scenes to balance things out.  The movie never gets overly serious.  Also, you'll see a few actors from other Kevin Smith movies, which was cool.  If you're a fan of Kevin Smith, you should watch this movie for that reason alone.  Although, I will say that some people may not like this because it is completely unlike any of his other movies, to my knowledge.",1095638400,2,770,4.183673469387755
2071494,4,B00029LO5O,"Once again, people cannot handle change or growth.  Some of us expect Kevin Smith to continue making movies in the vein of Clerks and MallRats until the day he dies.  Some of us don't think that it is a-okay for him to explorer different genres within the entertainment industry.  Believe me, he's an endlessly creative guy!  There be will be more movies like Dogma and Chasing Amy.  So enough on people, let's talk about the film. . .

It's a love story.  A predictable, thoroughly enjoyable love story.  The plot is sweet and absolutely sincere, there is nothing contrived here.  Ben Affleck, who I normally do not enjoy, truly shines in the film, which allows Ben to explore emotionality never before examined in his previous characters.  Of course, Liv Tyler is as lovely and convincing as always.  Additonally, George Carlin is typically quirky, cranky and yet oddly loveable.  And the young girl playing Ben's child Gertie is bound to be an onscreen success story.  All in all the movie, is just sappy enough and speckled with just enough funny moments to keep it from going the way of the Hallmark made for TV movie.  It should be a part of everyone's collection.",1095379200,2,1170,4.727722772277228
2071495,5,B00029LO5O,"This movie is awesome. You know why it didn't do so well in the theaters: Smith fans wanted the old humor of Clerks, Strike Back, etc., and Smith bashers were expecting another one of his vulgar comedies. In this movie you kind of get it all, although the comedy isn't quite as vulgar. Sure the scenarios are somewhat cliched, but hey isn't that the way life is, for every situation you go through there's many more people out there who have gone through the same thing. What makes it different is how the characters react to their situations. I'm sure many more people have given a plot analysis for this movie so I'm not going to bother boring you with that. Ben Affleck gives one of his best performances in this movie, I know people who can't stand him, but they like him in this movie. The little girl, Raquel Castro is amazing as a singer and actress in this movie. Don't worry about the whole Bennifer thing, there's very little of it in this movie, and when there is you can tell there is a certain chemistry. The whole cast is amazing, right down to a cameo by Will Smith as himself (in which he kind of bashes his movie I, Robot which is thought was hilarious). Definitely add this to your movie list. This is a good one for the whole family.",1095120000,2,1252,4.354700854700854
2071506,4,B00029LO5O,"Kevin Smith's style prior to this movie included well-written dialogue from thoughtful characters.  In particular, the View Askew Universe is populated with characters who talk frankly, honestly and often hilariously about sex.  That style is somewhat imperfectly transferred to a movie that features as one of it's main characters a 7 year old girl.

Ben Affleck portrays Ollie Trinke, a High-Profile New York music publicist who begins the picture married to Jennifer Lopez.  Poor J. Lo blows an aneurism in childbirth and Ollie is left with little Gertie - named after her Mom.

We see scenes of Ollie trying to juggle his 18 hour a day job with being a single Dad when he blows a gasket at a high-profile press outing for Will Smith.  (Will is late for the Hard-Rock Cafe ceremony and shows up later in the film as himself in a real ""good sport"" kind of role.) The incident becomes so famous among the hacks of New York that even years afterward they call it the ""Fresh Prince Incident"".  Ollie loses his high-profile job and moves back home to Dad's house in Jersey.  Dad is played by George Carlin in one of his best film performances.

Seven years are skipped and we again touch base with Ollie and Gertie.  From here Gertie is played by Raquel Castro, and I thought that she was not only a competent child actress, but she definitely looks like she could have been J-Lo's child.

Ollie is so single-mindedly devoted to being ""Dad"" here that he essentially doesn't date for 7 years.  He meets Maya, played by Liv Tyler, who works at the local video store while pursuing her degree in sociology.  They begin a relationship as essentially platonic - Maya is intrigued by this man who comes in 3-4 times a week and rents porno videos while little Gertie is renting either Barney or ""Dirty Dancing"".  At one point Maya decides to take a little sexual pity on Ollie, and I thought the scene that follows was one of the better thought-out ones of the film.

Ollie has been TRYING to get back into the limelight, but he is a professional pariah ever since the ""Fresh Prince Incident"".  Finally an old friend and subordinate offers him an interview.

Will Ollie get the job despite the ""Fresh Prince Incident""?  Will he force Gertie to leave the comfortable confines of George Carlin's Grandpa?  Will Ben Affleck come tearing back to his child's school at the last moment before Gertie gets up on her elementary school stage and performs in a Broadway-scale production that you see 7 year olds in all the time?

Kevin Smith gets his fingerprints indelibly on this film, but it's not as witty or profane as ""Clerks"" or ""Chasing Amy"".  It's also a little more ""by the formula"" than perhaps would be expected from this talented writer-director.  I got the sense that Liv Tyler was supposed to be a little frumpy as this video-store graduate student, but I couldn't help noticing that she looked an awful lot like one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood.

Recommended for those who would like a kinder, gentler Kevin Smith.  Jay and Silent Bob are nowhere to be seen.",1095120000,3,3071,4.686567164179104
2071507,5,B00029LO5O,This movie is great. I watched it last night with my daughter. I cryed and laughed through the whole movie. I think this is a great movie for all. It does have some language and may not be suitable for young children but overall its really a good movie.,1095120000,2,253,4.183673469387755
2071508,5,B00029LO5O,"It is unfortunate the ""Bennifer"" publicity phenomena ruined this film's possibility for being Mr. Smith's greatest success.  I am ashamed of myself (as ashamed as one can truly be when talking about movie opinions) for ever thinking the film's lack of success might have something to do with its quality.

I am a fan of Kevin Smith's work, I'll see a movie because he wrote it, and I'll buy a comic for the same reason.  (But for ""Batman"" I would not have crossed over to DC, but I had to when he resurrected ""Green Arrow."")  That said, this is his best film to date.  I loved ""Mallrats,"" and his dialogue in ""Dogma"" is beyond impressive; but this film deserves an Oscar if only for the emotion he gets across in concise, fantastic dialogue this time around.

Mr. Smith did not waste a word in his writing this time around, and films this so we feel at home with this characters, the emphasis is on them and their lives, not the long hallway or the perfectly framed garden view through a window.  It is his gift.

The story is sad, moving, and happy (though happy seems too trite of a word) and though it doesn't feel like a roller coaster, you realize you were on a sweet (or bittersweet) ride by the end of the film.

From the DVD extras, and from Kevin Smith's ""An Evening with Kevin Smith,"" it appears they are friends; so you cannot be happy a friend's broken engagement hurt your film's success.  If Kevin Smith ever employs Ben Affleck again it will be a true testament to their friendship.  I hope he does, because the best performances I have even seen from Ben Affleck are when he is in Kevin Smith's movies - beyond ""Chasing Amy,"" his performance as Bartleby in ""Dogma"" is his best IMO.

Mr. Smith dedicated this film to his father, and in the DVD Extras he mentions his father was able to see ""Jersey Girl"" after it was finished.  I am glad for them both; there is a lot to proud of in this film.",1095033600,4,1908,4.371104815864022
2071509,4,B00029LO5O,"""Jersey Girl"" is one of those films where the water level is at the halfway mark and viewers get to vote on whether it is half-full or half-empty.  Writer-director Kevin Smith is once again employing Ben Affleck, this time as Ollie Trinke, a publicist whose forte is slinging it fast and furious.  Ollie is at the top of his game and his wife, Gertrude (Jennifer Lopez), is about to have their first baby.  However, it ends up being their only baby because Gertrude dies in childbirth and Ollie is left to raise his daughter alone.  Actually, that is not really true, because Ollie dumps the baby on his own father, Bart (George Carlin) until the old guy has enough and forces Ollie to accept some responsibility.  Ollie cracks immediately under the pressure and with a few choice sentences commits professional suicide in public.

Seven years later father and daughter are on much better terms.  Gertie (Raquel Castro), named by her father for her mother, is deservedly the apple of her father's eye but finds it impossible to get him to take her to go see ""Cats.""  This is only because the musical stopped running three years earlier.  They are still living with Bart and Ollie also has a job with in the public works department of their New Jersey town.  A couple of times a week they go down to the local video store where Gertie finds something in the children's section (not ""Dirty Dancing"") while dad quickly sneaks something out of the adult film section.  The incongruity of this catches the attention of Maya (Liv Tyler), the clerk behind the counter at the video store, who enjoys making Ollie squirm until she finds out his story.  Then she decides that what Ollie really needs is to have sex.

Certainly ""Jersey Girl"" is predictable.  You know that as soon as Ollie finds a new level of contentment with his job and starts a romance for the first time in seven years there is going to be an opportunity to go back to his old life.  Gertie is all excited about the upcoming show the kids put on at school where they get to sing with a parent, so you know when things are coming to come to a head as well in this film.  But Gertie is really cute and so is Maya, and even if we do not totally buy that Ollie would suddenly go over the deep end and say words to his daughter that should never escape his lips (I wanted Bart to slap him at that point), we are still enjoying the ride because at least Smith's dialogue is always worth hearing.

On the plus side for the final accounting of ""Jersey Girl"" is that the running joke about Will Smith has a pretty good payoff.  If there is a point in the film where Smith avoids being predictable it is in the payoff scene and if he had to point to where the heart of this movie is it is going to be that scene.  You can also throw into the mix the fine work of Affleck's supporting cast that give him ample opportunity to play off of others and seem like he is playing more than himself.  As for J. Lo, after seeing how she took the entire movie away from Affleck in ""Gigli,"" it is just as well that she makes her indelible mark and then disappears early on in this one (okay, to be fair, the only thing really wrong with in ""Gigli"" was Affleck's performance).

On the negative side is the whole ""Sweeney Todd"" bit.  Now, realize that I love that musical and even staged a one-act version of it once upon a time.  So when Ollie drags Gertie off to see if I not only know that this is not exactly the Broadway show a father wants to take his seven-year-old daughter, but that the song we see being performed (""Johanna"") is from the second act, by which time Sweeney has already cut one throat and Mrs. Lovett has come up with the bright idea of using the body to solve the meat shortage she is facing in her pie shop.  Add to this what might be the biggest example of jumping the gun I have ever done in watching a movie in my life, because I was absolutely sure that the song Gertie wanted to sing from the show with her father was going to be the love song ""Not While I'm Around.""  I was already crying at the idea of how wonderful that moment was going to be when Ollie and Gertie sang that song together, or he sang it to her or whatever, so when it ends up being ""God, That's Good"" I was not only surprised but rather disappointed.

So while it is true that the cutest bits of ""Jersey Girl"" are already in the trailer you have probably scene, this is an enjoyable enough movie.  After ""Dogma"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" this 2004 film certainly constitutes a change of pace for Kevin Smith.  I still think ""Chasing Amy"" is Smith's best ""real"" film (""Dogma"" is off in a different universe) and also has Affleck's best performance to date as a leading man.  The DVD extras include a half-hour of Smith and Affleck walking down memory lane while trying to explain the strange ways in which their careers have crossed paths, replete with clips.  What is interesting in that bit is that Affleck is more interested in explaining Smith's movies than is Smith.",1094860800,2,5020,4.366666666666666

2071511,4,B00029LO5O,"Ever since Kevin Smith made Clerks, he has been threatening to make a PG-rated, mainstream audience-friendly movie that his folks could actually go and see. Jersey Girl was his attempt. The question remained, would he soften the edges of his trademark profanity-laden dialogue too much and lose the bulk of his fan base? Smith also had the misfortune of casting Ben Affleck and then girlfriend Jennifer Lopez after the whole Gigli fiasco. Any film with the two of them together was doomed to failure no matter how much her presence was downplayed and cut from the movie. Has Smith strayed too far from the familiar confines of his View Askew universe?

There is an audio commentary by Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck that is relaxed and conversational in tone as the two long-time friends joke and laugh with each other. This track is refreshingly free of the usual self-congratulatory backslapping that often plagues commentaries.

A second commentary features Smith, producer Scott Mosier and View Askew veteran actor, Jason Mewes. This is a more production-based track as Smith and Mosier talk about how the film was made-the camerawork, lighting, etc.

If you didn't get enough of Smith-Affleck banter on their commentary track then you're in for a real treat with the ""Ben Affleck and Kevin Smith Interview.""

""The Tonight Show's `Roadside Attractions' Featuring Kevin Smith"" is a series of ""humourous travelogues"" that Smith started doing for Jay Leno after 9/11.

Finally, there is a standard behind-the-scenes featurette. There are a lot of clips from the movie mixed with sound bites from the cast.

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back saw Kevin Smith veering very close to becoming a caricature of himself. Jersey Girl sees him return to his strengths of character-driven material like Chasing Amy where the dialogue was realistic and heartfelt. What makes this film work so well is the same reason why Clerks and Amy work and resonate-to paraphrase Holden at the end of the latter film, Smith finally had something personal to say.",1094601600,3,2033,5.053731343283582
2071512,4,B00029LO5O,"'Jersey Girl' is a family drama about the relationship between a father and his daughter and setting his priorities straight. Ben Affleck plays Ollie Trinke, a big time publicist who marries Gertrude (guest appearance by Jennifer Lopez); but shortly after giving birth to their child, Gertrude dies, leaving Ollie to take care of the child on his own. Ollie, frustrated with everything that's happened, also loses his job, moves in his father's place and starts raising his child, and as the story progresses, realizes what is really important in life.

Kevin Smith, who made previous movies like Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, switches into a different stream by creating a family/comedy/drama, and succeeds in doing so. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler deliver good performances in the movie. I was a little skeptical as to whether Ben Affleck would act out his role well, but after watching the movie, I can say can act of any role and act it well! However, best performance however goes to Raquel Castro, who plays little Gertie, Ollie's daughter in the movie. Even though this was her first major role in a movie, she acted out her part really well. Jason Biggs also gives a good performance, although he did not have much of a role to play in the movie. The soundtrack for this movie is also good and plays some good tracks during specific scenes in the movie.

Although it is not the most original storyline (see `I am Sam' and Sean Penn's amazing performance) and is predictable, it is nevertheless has it's moments, and is fun to sit down and spend your time with a subtle entertaining movie like `Jersey Girl' and enjoy.",1093046400,3,1625,4.779359430604982
2071513,4,B00029LO5O,"Kevin Smith, creator of comedy flicks like Chasing Amy, Mallrats, & Jay & Silent Bob, brings us a star-laden film with sentimental cliches worthy of a Family Man sequel.  Ben Affleck is an overworked publicist for the stars whose wife Gertrude(J.Lo) dies during delivery of their child.  George Carlin plays the Affleck character's dad, Jason Biggs plays a colleague, Will Smith appears briefly as himself, Liv Tyler plays a love interest in the Jersey town where the widower returns to live with his dad after losing his job as a publicist after losing his temper toward a group of entertainment journalists.  The real stand-out performance is by the child in this movie.  The ending is somewhat formulaic and lacks depth, but is adequate for the story.  This film has some adult-oriented humor despite its sentimental storyline and sappy classic rock soundtrack (Springsteen's Rising, Fleetwood Mac's Landslide, The Cure's High, etc.)  There is even some musical element to the movie plot, with little Gertie doing Sweeney Todd material with her family for a school performance.

2071514,5,B00029LO5O,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I was expecting a romantic comedy, but this is more a movie about the relationship between a single dad and his little girl, and really hits on the comedic moments on life.  A couple had it all: money, career, marriage, love, pregnancy - then tragedy strikes and the dad is left to raise the little girl alone.  Being a grieving and ambitious dad, it takes a while for Ben to learn how to be a good dad, but he does almost great from there.  There were some things that were a bit jarring, like the swearing and talk about porn part (so maybe not ready good for very young audiences), but the witty dialogue and life decisions were really great.  One of the highlights of the movie is a cameo by a famous actor, well known for his cool action and drama roles, who talks about what it's like to be a dad. Even when the dad comes to his daughter's rescue it's not corny, because of the somewhat shocking nature of the song.
