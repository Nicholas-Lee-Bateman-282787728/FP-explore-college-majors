7876010,2,6304698070,"This film is really cheap and really cheesy. Do not buy. Rent.
On the plus side, the plot line could have been decent. It was hard to tell under the bad acting and poor film quality(ever taped something SLP? Like that.) There's a short Henry Rollins sighting (one line) and both Stan Lee and Frank Miller have bit parts. If you've ever played Whitewolf's Vampire RPG, you'll recognize the vampires.",996537600,2,398,4.7
