8077879,4,B000AD6A7O,"The director Selin is seeking to glorify the low life and the emotional wasteland of certain individuals on the edge of Finnish society. These ""restless"" young people are depicted as leading a life (mostly) without work, spending their time smoking, drinking enormous quantities of alcohol and having sex left and right and using drugs as well. Needless to say that this is not the way of life of the average Finnish youth. However, depicting sex, drugs and rock and roll brings in the public and thus the money.

Almost all characters in this film are negative and the apparent love between the protagonists cannot redeem them as it is merely a form of escapism. The only one who stands out as a ray of hope for the future is the child Joonas (a very good performance).

The film itself was declared the best Finnish film of 2001, and the leading actress Irina Bjrklund received a film prize for her performance, while the love song featured in the film (Milla by Anssi Kela) became a big hit in Finland.

Irina Bjrklund is very good in this Finnish picture, which although has its weaknesses. Its too clever in telling a great passion story. The people are too ""real"", too ""uncompromising"", too ""brave"". They are too much emotionally correct, so to say. It is also too obvious that we ought to like them and their feeling without reluctance.",1355356800,,1343,4.706382978723404
8077880,1,B000AD6A7O,"I have to repeat boring and mainstream and if you watch mainstream you not going to remember this flick for long but to watch something boring is beyond my comprehension. Very simple movie with no real plot, exactly one chick undressing once and you start thinking immediately-go away, you, ugly and this is most exciting moment in all movie. As this movie is about Finland you don't see anything about Finland but this ugly chick and as I was planning to visit their country after watching first movie from series now I change my mind.",1325289600,,536,4.652631578947369
