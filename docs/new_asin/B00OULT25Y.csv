8685049,1,B00OULT25Y,"Not happy at all.  LOVE this movie and was very disappointed in this BluRay.  It simply will not play on any BluRay player.  On top of that, the languages are not right - there is NO English at all.  No subtitles either.  This was a major let down.  On top of all that it is a BD-R.  A bootleg.",1459555200,,294,3.8813559322033897
