3520200,5,B001CUAXZY,"Like others have said, they never dive to the wreck because diving is banned, but it was a great documentary nonetheless.
For the novice, it's a great first look at the story of the Fitzgerald, and the interviews with family members of the crew really adds a lot of heartbreaking perspective to what happened that November night.
It's definitely worth owning and has a high re-watchability factor.
I would also recommend that if you get this, get Dive Detectives: The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald as this updates facts of what may have happened to the Fitzgerald and offered an opposing view that it did indeed was wrenched apart on the surface, diving on the wreck of the David J. Morell, which snapped in half on the surface before she sank  to prove their point and dispelling the ""Hatchway cave-in"".
SIDE NOTE: While performing a concert in Detroit, Gordon Lightfoot was approached by a mother of one and daughter of another man charged with ""dogging"" (clamping down) the hatches.
They told Lightfoot of the new evidence dispelling the hatches coming off by not being properly clamped down, which pointed the finger at the men in charge of that.
They told him that the line in his song, ""At 7PM a main hatchway caved in, he said fellas it's been good to know ya!"" it made them cringe.
Out of respect for these women and their families, Lightfoot wrote a new line that night and sang, ""At 7PM, it was dark, it was then, he said fellas, it's been good to know ya!""
Although not changing the copyrighted version, he now sings the revised song live.
You have class, Mr. Lightfoot.",1388275200,5,1582,4.65
3520201,3,B001CUAXZY,"The documentary just scratched the surface of what could have caused the ship to sink.  I would like to know how the families have coped since the lost of their love ones.

3520203,4,B001CUAXZY,"""Deep Sea Detectives: Death of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" is an interesting documentary about the most famous Great Lakes shipwreck of all time. Made for the History Channel, it is hosted by divers Richie Kohler and John Chatterton, most famous for their work on the ""U-869."" I found the account of their trips to the German submarine, ""Shadow Divers,"" (by Robert Kurson) to be one of the most stunning pieces of nonfiction I have ever read, and I have been hooked on their analysis of shipwrecks ever since. With such a buildup as that, I probably expected too much of this 50-minute documentary.

The premise of the documentary is to get to the bottom of the mystery and answer the question of what sank the ""Fitzgerald"" on November 10, 1975. Three main theories are discussed, and all are well known to people literate about the ""Fitzgerald"" foundering. Kohler and Chatterton discuss all three (breaking apart on the surface, shoaling in shallow water near Caribou Island, and water impingement through hatch covers or seals) in turn. They both discredit the surface breakup theory, which is also widely discredited by most professionals familiar with the sinking (I agree.) Since there are legal protections in place courtesy of the Canadian government (the ""Fitz"" is barely in Canadian waters,) no further dives on the ship are now permitted at the request of the families of the deceased crewmembers, which puts the two world-famous divers in the weird place of having to review dive footage of the ship from other expeditions. Unsurprisingly, at the end of the day they can't answer the question of what sank the great ship, and it's doubtful that anyone will ever know for sure.

The documentary gives a brief background of the ship, and includes some interesting photographs and film of the ""Fitzgerald"" and her crewmen. Unfortunately this brief retrospective at the beginning of the show is edited together with very quick cuts (Did the editor come from MTV?) which really took away from the final product. The CGI scenarios of the sinking were well done although modest in scope, and the commentary by Chatterton and Kohler is accurate, insightful, and interesting, though will not provide much new information on the sinking if you are even modestly educated on the loss beforehand. I enjoyed the film, and especially liked the interviews with family members and famous ""Fitzgerald"" historians, notably Frederick Stonehouse, whose book ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" is still the best overall account of the loss. While I liked this History Channel production, I greatly prefer and recommend ""The Fitzgerald Investigations,"" which is much more all-encompassing, and is better organized and paced.",1292371200,10,2710,5.115124153498871
3520204,4,B001CUAXZY,"Viewers of Deep Sea dectectives are familiar with the series which tells the stories of famous and not so famous shipwrecks in the northern hemisphere.  Viewers not familiar with this excellent series may be drawn to this particular program by the fame of the Edmund Fitzgerald from the song of the same name by Gordon Lightfoot.

The program briefly relates the history of the ship from its launching until its sinking in November 1975.  The rest of the program documents the different expeditions first to find the wreckage and later to determine the cause of the ship's foundering.

The series' hosts, Richie Kohler and John Chatterton, usually dive to the shipwreck featured in that program.  The viewer sees footage of their dive and the condition of the wrecked ship.  Often by diving to the wreck the hosts can determine the cause of the shipwreck.

In the case of the Edmund Fitzgerald, the Ricky and John don't dive to the wreck.  Instead they show films from the different expeditions to the Edmund Fitzgerald from the first Coast Guard expedition to find where the ship sand to a final exploration in 1996.

Along the way we are introduced to some family members of the lost crew, people who have dived the wreck, staff at the Great Lakes Shipwreck museam, and other experts on shipping on the Great Lakes.  The interviews with the families of the ship's crew is a poignant reminder that most wrecks involve the loss of life and that families are left behind with a tragic loss and no body to bury.

This is a fascinating program for anyone who is curious about ships and shipwrecks, or just about the Edmund Fitzgerald.

ALL the Deep Sea detectives are great, but this one is outstanding.",1231372800,17,1700,4.744897959183674
