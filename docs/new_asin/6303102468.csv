560454,2,6303102468,"The Rains Came is an early example of the disaster films popular in the 70s, and unfortunately, like those films, this movie is long on special effects and short on story.  Myrna Loy plays a woman with a ""bad""  past who falls in love with an Indian doctor played by Tyrone Power.  George Brent stars as one of Loy's former boyfriends, who has romantic  problems with a young girl (Brenda Joyce) who basically wants to get out of  her parents' home.  In the midst of all this, an earthquake hits Ranchipur  and causes a spectacular flood, perhaps the only really interesting thing  that happens in the film.  Loy and Brent look bored and give bland  performances.  Power manages to deliver a performance that has more life in  it.  The special effects are good during the flood, although it appears  that they simply shook the camera to get the earthquake effect!  The story  is trite and the movie is poorly paced.  This was a real disappointment to  me.",951350400,4,954,4.610778443113772
560455,4,6303102468,"A complex love story periled against the wrath of Mother Nature makes this one of the better films I've seen. The earthquake and dam-busting scenes are superb and frighteningly realistic, echoing images of disaster from  another film of similar ideas, ""The Hurricane"" (1937) (read my  review of that as well). The cast is great but some of the dialogue sounds  totally devoid of any creativity or could even be humanly natural.  Nominated for 6 Academy Awards and winning the Oscar for Best Special  Effects. A must for disaster, love story, Myrna Loy, and Tyrone Power fans.",923875200,8,575,4.947916666666667

560517,5,6303102468,"1939.  It is just that Myrna Loy is known as a nearly middle aged comic actress than as a sexy lady.  The books about her tell a diffenent story.  Power didn't live long enough to make it to the ooooh.  ahhh,  era.  I would say George Clooney was as close to Power as in wild and sexy guy.  Power died in his mid 40's.
The highlight of the film belongs to Myrna Loy.  She does something in the movie that is so close to life as possible.  She dies.  Not in an operatic sense.  Flailing all over the place, and tears flowing like a break in a damn.  She dies as a result of a common mistake.  She drinks polluted water because she is tired and worn out for treating plague victims, she has finally found herself at last. The expression on her face as she realizes what she has done is heartbreaking.  Now she must leave the world and she does it in a natural way,  The way death normally happens,  Garbo managed to die in a magnificent way, the light went out of her eyes and were still.  Myrna Loy gives such a sweet and beautiful demise.  I know of what I speak as my mother died in a peaceful way, it is in the eyes.

Power is fine.  His youth and innocence play off well against Loy's lady of the world as captured by an obnoxious wealthy beast.  The Louis Bromfield novel is worth the time, but as is true with the book , '' Gone With the Wind''. there are people in the book that are absent in the film.  It is still a great film.",1477872000,,1435,4.05

While the special effects are good for the time, vast improvements in technology have benefited films like ""The Rains of Ranchipor.""

560615,4,6303102468,"I enjoyed this film. It is in black and white. The story centers around American and British colonials living in an imaginary state of Ranchipur. Although this is a fictional state, its culture, clothes, and language are Indian. The plot centers around the romance of a married woman, Lady Edwina Esketh and a dedicated doctor, Major Rama Safti. This relationship is troublesome not only because Lady Esketh is married, but also because this isn't her first extra-marital affairs. However, what started for Lady Esketh as another adventure turns into real love. An earthquake, the destruction of a dam, and the flooding of Ranchipur follows and Lady Esketh's love shifts toward redemption. I will leave to the viewer Lady Esketh's fate.

Another romance takes place between John Ransome, popularly known as a womanizer and alcoholic, and a young American girl, Fern, daughter of American Christian missionaries who wants to abandon their superficial lifestyle and know the world. Ransome, who early in the film shows a cynical attitude toward life decides to be of use to the government of Ranchipur, and also begins a serious relationship with Fern. The disaster also has a redemptive effect on Ransome. By the way, Ransome is a likable character, lost in this country because he has stopped believing in anything, and then, changing to a person who has commitment. 

I recommend this film, not only because of the stories of love and redemption, but also because of the serious dialogue - Ransome's speech on Queen Victoria had a literary style -, the acting was good, and the special effects of the earthquake, the breaking of the dam, and the flooding of Ranchipur were quite impressive for 1939. I'm still wondering how they did it then. In sum, this is the kind of film that I enjoy watching several times.   ",1368403200,6,1815,4.973597359735973

560701,5,6303102468,"I read the book many years ago and saw this film also many years ago. Found it on Amazon and decided to order it and see it again. I thought Myrna Loy was not physically suited to the role. She is more suited to comedy roles as I can never get past that Bob Hope nose. But, she was certainly adequate and Tyrone Power can make pretty much anybody look good. This may be the finest acting job George Brent has ever done. His reactions alone are fine acting. One can just go through the movie watching him ""react"" to things. I have seriously underestimated him in the past. His scenes with Brenda Joyce, who should have been out of her depth but carried her weight, are wonderfully tender. I adore Tyrone Power but there are far too many left profile views of him and his left profile is not very good in spite of his being, in my opinion, the handsomest man ever on screen. You see that odd, sort of plain, profile then he turns to face you and there is the most beautiful face in the world. It's like seeing two different men. Didn't anybody notice this. I've always heard that people's profiles differ and I've heard of actors or actresses who refused to be photographed from one side. I can see that it's true that there is a difference. His right profile is fine, the left is unattractive. This is a true B&W classic film, very enjoyable. The special effects, especially for that time, are wonderful and very believable. This is an excellent adaptation of the book, well acted, beautifully filmed.",1341964800,2,1500,4.458181818181818
560702,5,6303102468,"Excellent movie if you are a classic film lover!!  It won the 1939 Oscar for Best Effects/Special Effects and I can see why.  When the rains came, all hell broke loose.  It was pretty amazing for a movie made in the Golden Age of films.  Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz were both nominated in the same category, but, obviously, didn't win.  Although I love both of those movies, this movie deserved the Academy Award!  Story is also very enthralling, adapted from the novel of the same name by Louis Bromfield. A must for any movie collector who loves the classics.",1331510400,,573,4.461538461538462
560703,5,6303102468,"This great classic is far better than most of what we see in theaters today. The special effects are incredible for a 30's movie, and in fact won the Oscar for Special Effects for 1939. All the actors are well cast, even in the minor roles. Tyrone Power...described in the movie by Myrna Loy as the ""pale copper Apollo""... is the perfect Major Safti and handles the role with poise and maturity in spite of being a few months shy of 25 when the film was made.(If you read Louis Bromfield's book, you see that the Major needs to be uncommonly handsome, and he is!) George Brent is likable, Myrna Loy is beautiful, Maria Ouspenskaya is...well, unique as always.

I like that there are light moments thrown in to keep us from being overwhelmed by tragedy. My only criticism is that Ty Power, as the central character, has far too little screen time and George Brent maybe too much. All and all, this film will hold your attention for all 103 min. of it, and then leave you wishing for more!",1323648000,2,987,4.45303867403315
560704,4,6303102468,"The startling earthquake scenes at the climax of MGM's 1936 crowdpleaser ""San Francisco"" are only rivalled by the rumblings in THE RAINS CAME, Twentieth Century-Fox's opulent 1939 screen version of the Louis Bromfield novel.  1939, that singular year in film history which boasts such all-time classics as ""Gone with the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Dodge City"" and ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"".  THE RAINS CAME sits comfortably in that extraordinary year as well, though in comparison with the titles listed above, sadly doesn't seem to be as well-remembered.

World-weary Lady Edwina Esketh (Myrna Loy) travels with her husband to the exotic Indian outpost of Ranchipur, where she's reunited with old flame Tom Ransome (George Brent), but Edwina knows their time has passed.  Instead, she is fascinated by Tom's best friend, Major Rama Safti (Tyrone Power), a gifted surgeon, and, as she will find out, the man being groomed as the one to lead modern India into a new era.  Safti initially doesn't take much interest in shallow Edwina.  But once the annual Monsoon strikes, so does a series of terrorising earthquakes and an outbreak of the plague.  Through selflessness and servitude, Edwina finally wins the admiration of the surgeon, but other forces are at work to keep them apart.

""San Francisco"" has the earthquake.  ""Elephant Walk"" has it's cholera outbreak.  But THE RAINS CAME has the quake, the outbreak AND throws a flood into the bargain!  And it's one of the most memorable films of the 1930s.  Call it silly, sentimental romantic melodrama, but THE RAINS CAME is anything but dull.  George Brent (who also found himself in the 1939 classics ""Dark Victory"" and ""The Old Maid"", both opposite Bette Davis), wisely underplays his role, knowing full-well that it's Loy and Power's show.  Unlike other actors who played ""pan-ethic"" (and looked every inch out-of-place), Tyrone Power's natural dark features give him a credible anchor in his portrayal of Safti.  Just go along with it.  And Myrna Loy playing against her screwball Nora Charles persona?  She's absolutely dazzling.

Co-starring Brenda Joyce, Maria Ouspenskaya, Nigel Bruce, Mary Nash, Joseph Schildkraut, Henry Travers, Jane Darwell and Marjorie Rambeau.  Remade in 1955 as ""The Rains of Ranchipur"" with Lana Turner, Richard Burton and Fred MacMurray.",1298419200,3,2318,5.216216216216216

560706,5,6303102468,"This film is not as well known as some of the other superb films of 1939 (e.g., ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""The Wizard Of Oz""), yet I feel it is another exceptional production in that magical film year.

First is the casting.  Myrna Loy, who gets top billing here, is excellent as the frivolous society woman who finally falls in love, but unfortunately for an Indian doctor who is destined for greatness in his own country.  This is a very different...but believable...Loy than you saw in the ""Thin Man"" series, but she shines here, too.  I was particularly impressed with her death scene...even though you know she's going to pass over, you don't realize she has at first.  Remarkable acting.

Although George Brent gets third billing, he nearly steals the show in most of the movie.  As always, suave and sophisticated, and this time as a one-time playboy who is suddenly put to the test.

If there's a disappointment, it may be the part played by Tyrone Power.  Although the film revolves around him, he seems to have less screen time than Loy or Brent.  In terms of the make-up to make him look Indian...well, the hair is right, but nothing else about him looks the least bit Indian, and his English is perfect American English, where it probably should be more of an Indian-British accent.  Ah well.

Some of the character actors in supporting roles are great, too.  Nigel Bruce plays a role unlike any I'm familiar with in his career -- despicable -- and you can't help but be happy when he meets his death.  Maria Ouspenskaya, who when I was a boy stood out for her role as the gypsy in ""The Wolf Man"", plays a great role as an Indian ""queen""...barefoot and all.  Jane Darwell and Henry Travers have smaller roles, but are always great in anything they do.  And you'll recognize Laura Hope Crews (from ""Gone With The Wind"", Aunt Pittypat).  H.B. Warner has an essential, though minor role.

The special effects for this film won an Academy Award, and deservedly so.  The earthquake, bursting of the dam, and resulting flood is stunning done considering this was 1939.

In short, buy this film!  Although I was less than impressed with Tyrone Power in this film (and in recent years I have become much more of a fan of his films), this is a wonderful classic film.",1283212800,2,2269,4.5945273631840795

Seventy years later, the earthquake-to-flood sequence still holds up impressively, even in the age of CGI programming with a surprisingly seamless combination of models, mattes and huge dump tanks. The artistry of Fox effects whiz Fred Sersen's work is worth slogging through the first fifty minutes of archaic set-up. Directed by MGM veteran Clarence Brown (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Yearling/dp/B000069I1J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Yearling</a>), the story would appear to have the makings of a romantic triangle given the three leads, but it actually consists of two contrasting love stories.

Set in colonial India at its most exotic (although filmed entirely on the studio back lot), one thread centers on Tom Ransome, an aging, alcoholic British playboy pursued by Fern Simon, the love-struck daughter of local missionaries. The other is the forbidden romance that develops between Lady Edwina Esketh, the adulterous British wife of a pompous horse breeder and Major Rama Safti, a Hindu doctor devoted to his homeland. The calamitous disaster obviously veers all four off course as they find themselves re-evaluating their feelings for one another until fate steps in and decides for them. The second love story is obviously a metaphor for the diminishing hold Britain had on India in the years prior to Mahatma Gandhi's rise as the leader of the burgeoning republic. However, the May-December romance between Ransome and Fern initially follows a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lolita/dp/B000UJ48VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lolita</a>-esque course that offsets the balance of the film. Course correction comes with the unusually well-cast principals.

Usually playing warm-hearted wives both scrappy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thin-Man/dp/B0009ZE9N0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thin Man</a>) and noble (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Years-of-Our-Lives/dp/0792846133/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Years of Our Lives</a>), Myrna Loy surprises with a sexy, assured performance as Lady Edwina. She cuts a diaphanous figure as a voracious temptress and transitions convincingly to a woman desperate for moral redemption. It's a shame Loy had so few opportunities to show this uncensored side of her talent. Ridiculously handsome, Tyrone Power doesn't look remotely Indian even with a turban and constant tan. During the matinee idol phase of his career, he lacked depth and nuance, for example, take note of his embarrassing bad breakdown scene late in the film. However, he is obviously here for eye candy, and Loy's lustful glances are well justified in this regard.

Perhaps because he is not playing opposite the vivid fieriness of constant co-star Bette Davis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Victory/dp/B0008ENIDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Victory</a>), the usually bland George Brent is terrifically engaging as Ransome. I have to admit his witty banter with Loy held my interest far more than the concealed passion between her and Power. For better or worse, Brenda Joyce brings a strangely off-kilter dimension to Fran. Several great recognizable character actors fill the supporting parts, a few playing purely Hollywood versions of exotics - Jane Darwell, Henry Travers, H.B. Warner, Marjorie Rambeau, Joseph Schildkraut - though none makes a more vivid impression than Maria Ouspenskaya (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Affair/dp/B00176VK8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Affair</a>) as the worldly wise Maharani with her dangling cigarette holder.

560709,4,6303102468,"THE RAINS CAME (1939) was 20th Century Fox's entry into the disaster genre of the 1930s'.  It features a all-star cast taken from the top studios lead by Tyrone Power (FOX), Myrna Loy (MGM), George Brent (WB) as well as a host of character actors.  All contributed to this drama in a professional manner, but the real star is the Special Visual Effects.

FRED SERSEN head of the Visual Effects department at FOX was one of the best in the business.  He was able to get the most out of the technology of the time too effectively integrate full sized sets, miniatures and traveling mattes.  Rightly he (& Edmund H. Hansen) won the Academy Award for Visual Effects.  This going against some heavy weight competition including GONE WITH THE WIND (1939).

The film was remade in 1955 as THE RAINS OF RANCHIPUR.  Even with the advantages of CinemaScope and color it did not eclipse the original.  Which also kept truer to the book.  So if your going to make a choice go with the original.",1233014400,4,982,4.56

560799,3,6303102468,"The Rains Came is one of the less successful examples of the genius of the studio system. Part of the 30s vogue for disaster movies (San Francisco, In Old Chicago), the violence of the spectacle is truly impressive when the earthquakes and floods hit at the halfway point, but the human drama is less engaging, partially due to a plethora of weak characters that it's hard to care about in too many tired scenes that don't catch fire. Too much of the film is carried by George Brent's dissolute ex-pat fending off Brenda Joyce's advances, while an uflatteringly shot Myrna Loy is too self-centered to care for. Tyrone Power's noble Indian doctor almost seems an afterthought, getting surprisingly little screentime (presumably in case he kisses a white woman and gives the censors a coronary), although there is some novelty value in Nigel Bruce playing Loy's genuinely unpleasant husband (a match almost as unlikely as H.B.

560801,4,6303102468,"The Rains Came was released the same year Gone with the Wind (1939) brought a storm of viewers to the silver screen.  Unlike Gone with the Wind, which received a legendary status in the cinema history, The Rains Came only made an impact in the special effects department.  The special effects are rather amazing, even today many viewers will drop their jaws, as they ponder the age of the film and the fantastic catastrophe sequence in the film's midpoint.  However, the film presents an experience that parallels the cheap thrills of melodramatic afternoon TV drama of longing homemakers and bored college students.

The film follows a traditional Hollywood concept of star-loaded talent attracting a large audience, which is blatantly obvious in the film.  Tyrone Power, as the Indian medical doctor Major Rama Safti, will have the women of the 1940s having their knees give away.  A lively George Brent provides the role of the aging playboy Thomas Ransome seeking seclusion in the Indian province of the story while encountering the love struck 18-year old Fern cast by first time actor and beauty Brenda Joyce.  Additional melodrama emerges through the appearance of the infamous Myrna Loy, best remembered for her part in the Thin Man films.  Together these four actors provide a solid cast, which is backed up by an equally impressive supporting cast.

The film opens in a sweltering India in 1938 where drought, famine, and sickness trouble the Indian province of Ranchipur.  It is midday and people are going about their business while Thomas Ransome sits in the shade of his porch trying to cool down and preoccupy his boredom with a slingshot.  An amusing notion is that there are no sweat rings, or other signs of heavy perspiration, besides to the water pearls on the foreheads, which would be normal in heat such as the one in the film.  An assumption could be that stars do not perspire heavily, as it would probably lower their star quality.  Nonetheless, the beginning of the story discloses that Major Safti and Thomas are good friends, Thomas cannot get out of a garden party, and everyone prays for the rainy season to arrive.  The story is told out of Thomas' perspective, but the focus is on the events taking place around him.

At the garden party, Thomas meets the youthful beauty Fern, who requests his help to break the chains of her parents.  It puts Thomas in an awkward situation, but he does not really worry about it.  Later, he also meets an old friend and confidant, Lady Esketh (Myrna Loy), at Maharajah's palace, and it is here the witch's brew begins to simmer.  Lady Esketh first drifts off to some secluded area of the palace with Thomas where something (let your imagination run free) happened, and later falls for Major Safti.  This instigates an intriguing triangle drama between Thomas, Lady Esketh, and Lord Esketh (Nigel Bruce), but Lord Esketh doesn't ever suspect Major Safti for anything.

When the emotional witch brew seems to hit its high point the rains begin followed by a severe earthquake.  Here the audience gets a chance to experience a magnificent example of the special effects capabilities of the 1940s.  However, the emotional turmoil begins to seep away, as a greater problem has emerged that has set all people in danger.  There are several other subplots within, but the film only touches on the issues the way a soap opera would. In addition, there are cultural misconceptions within the film, which often have the purpose of glamorizing the actors.  Jean Renoir's the River (1951) does a far better job depicting the Indian culture, as he also shot the film on location.  Yet, the film tries to be good, and tries to enlighten the audience, but does not achieve the film's full potential.  Despite the culturally awkward situations, it is within the effort of trying to teach the audience a valuable lesson where it also puts forth a cinematic experience worthwhile in a Western perspective that will amuse an attentive audience.",1131753600,7,3994,4.897473997028232
560802,1,6303102468,"A shocking movie.  George Brent plays a drunken bum with a shady past.  He takes advantage of a pathetic, very confused, borderline psychotic girl young enough to be his granddaughter.  This is regarded as noble and beautiful, despite the fact that the child obviously needs psychiatric care, not a drunken, lecherous old man slobbering all over her (their scenes together are nauseating).  The leader of the region, played by Maria Ouspenskaya, rewards Brent by taking him on as one of the planners of the new state after the devastation, because she has ""faith in him.""  Why?  He's a drunken, disgusting old pervert.  Brent's former girlfriend, Myrna Loy, who apparently has had a few boyfriends, but is nowhere near as reprehensible as Brent, is presented as the epitome of evil.  He is a saint, she is a sinner.  Ouspenskaya demands that Loy be thrown out of the country, despite the fact that Loy has totally reformed and is working day and night in the hospital helping flood and plague victims.  My, what a bad girl!  Shame on her!  She must be punished!

560803,5,6303102468,"Grandiose, lavish, entertaining, beautifully filmed, blockbuster, exotic-adventure movie, set in Ranchipur, India, based upon Louis Bromfield's novel, directed by MGM's first class director, Clarence Brown, on loan out to 20th Century Fox, with a great cast: dashing, young, heartthrob Tyrone Power (Major Rama Safti), in the role of an Indian doctor, who falls for aristocratic Englishwoman-with-a-tempestuous-past, Myrna Loy (Lady Edwina Esketh), who's married to an arrogant, unpleasant and unbearable Nigel Bruce (Lord Esketh). On the other hand, in Ranchipur lives a man with whom Loy, when very young, had an affair: aristocratic English man-of-the-world (with a very bad reputation), George Brent (Tom Ransome), who at the same time is being pursued by pretty, willful, 18 year old Brenda Joyce (Fern Simon), an American girl who lives in a Mission and wants to get out of her parents' home, whose social climbing and very snob mother, Marjorie Rambeau (Mrs. Simon) encourages the affair, because she longs to ""rub shoulders"" with the upper classes.
Others in this noteworthy long cast: Maria Ouspensakaya, who is stunningly  great as the Maharani, H.B. Warner, as his husband the Maharajah, Ranchipur's Ruler, Joseph Schildkraut, as an ""occidentalized"" Indian, Mr. Bannerjee, Jane Darwell (who the same year acted in GWTW), as ""Aunt"" Phoebe Smiley, a down-to-earth American woman who lives in the Mission, Henry Travers (the future ""angel"" of  Capra's 1946 ""It's a Wonderful Life"") as her husband Mr. Smiley, Mary Nash (famous for her nasty roles opposite Shirley Temple in both, ""Heidi"" (1937) and ""The Little Princess"" (1939)), as the rather jealous Miss Mc Daid, Power's nurse assistant, who I perceived as helplessly in love with him, and Laura Hope Crews (who the same year was the very funny Aunt Pittypat in GWTW), in a small role, as an aristocratic English Lady.
In all a very good picture with great special effects, featuring lots of rain, a big earthquake and a flood, in the same vein of other famous disaster films of the era, like: ""San Francisco"" (1936), ""The Hurricane"" (1937), ""The Good Earth"" (1937), and ""In Old Chicago"" (1938).

560804,1,6303102468,"This was a BORING movie. I can't really say anything else, except it was putting me to sleep. The main characters  were never developed. None of them were really interesting to me anyway. If a movie doesn't make me care about the characters and their lives, then the movie is just a waste of time for me. I didn't care about these people or why they were in India. It would have been much nicer if the flood had just swept all these boring people away and swept the soundstage clean to set up for making a more interesting movie. If you like Myrna Loy, who was in this, I recommend you skip this and see her in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"".",1027296000,3,641,4.169354838709677

I believe that is true, and because I think that, I have to say that there is no way this could ever truly be classified as ""drama"". Somebody opted to do just the opposite and leave all the dull bits IN. I wonder what you would call that.
I give this three stars only because Tyrone Power did look pretty groovy in the Indian outfits, and the ""cute little moustache and the big dark eyes"" added to the effect. Otherwise I would have taken off two stars and given it one because I couldn't give it less.
One thing that was interesting was how George Brent really reminded me of Rhett Butler, meaning that he could have taken Clark Gable's role and been equally effective. Something about him in this movie. Don't know what exactly... because I've seen him in other movies and he never struck me as a Rhett possibility.
Myrna Loy did so many better roles... in The Best Years of Our Lives, The Bachelor and the Bobby-soxer, and even Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House was made tolerable because her role was the best one. Here she wasn't anything much.
None of the characters were very well-developed and I would have liked to have seen more Henry Travers. Oh well. All I can say is... maybe you'll like this movie more than I did. I just can't recommend it very highly somehow...",1027123200,,1357,4.453815261044177

7837574,5,6303102468,"This truly excellent, outstanding and engrossing B&W romantic drama from 20th Century Fox won an Oscar (1939) for it's breathtaking Special Effects. It was also Oscar-nominated for Best Cinematography; Best Art Direction (Adventures of Robin Hood won it; which was in Technicolor); Best Music (exceptionally taut & haunting score by 9-time Oscar Winner, Alfred Newman); Best Editing and Best Sound Recording. If the Academy had an Oscar for ""Casting,"" this film would have won it.

Set within Ranchipur, a fictional state somewhere in British-influenced India, by today's standards this film has an exotic ""period piece"" feel to it... but the storyline, plot and characters are all timeless and fascinating.  So much happens so quickly and dramatically, I dare not give away any ""spoilers"" to the epic events that take place... so incredibly enhanced by Newman's extraordinary Musical Score (and an influence on the likes of contemporary composers Hans Zimmer, James Horner and John Williams).

So (as I work in the Film Industry in LA) I will mention something that will be of interest to those who are interested in Film Trivia.  The legendary Oscar-winning Earthquake scene... The 20th Century Fox Studio was (and still is) located on Pico in West LA (Los Angeles); and prior to WW2 their Back Lot consisted of almost all the vacant land behind (North of) the Fox front gate on Pico, going all the way up to Olympic Blvd and well beyond. In other words, nearly all the land that is currently occupied by Century City was/is owned by Fox ( thus it's no coincidence that the skyscraper Location in the first Die Hard film was shot in Century City). Sorry, I digress...

Anyway, all of the villages, structures, buildings, the Dam (a huge miniature) and the interiors of the Royal Palace and Hospital were built and shot on the Back Lot or inside the Fox stages. Pretty much the norm for any big production by a major studio during that time... but what was truly amazing about this production is the amount of prep-work that went into those Earthquake shots.  All of the Buildings and Sets that were specifically built to ""collapse"" on cue; and NOT just look like a Set falling apart; but to actually fall apart in a very realistic way... collapsing into huge piles of rocks and rubble.

Among the many noteworthy shots is a scene where the earth opens up in the midst of a large crowd of people and a huge section of the ground suddenly drops down over twenty feet!  Also the scenes in which these Sets are inundated with water are nothing short of incredible. A testimony to the masterful skills and efforts by the Effects Crew, the Art Department; the Construction & Rigging Crews as well as all of the members of the Production in orchestrating this Epic spectacle.

In addition to the ""physical effects"" (break-away buildings, Sets and props); the Optical Effects department deserves immense credit (and that Oscar) for their seamless insertion of rushing and flooding water and as well as fire effects that are truly amazing in consideration that this was produced nearly 40 years before early computers and CGI FX became a standard tool in the Film Industry.  Epic, suspenseful, tragic and heartbreaking... One of my all-time favorite B&W Classics from 20th Century Fox.

PS ~ Note the ""Invisible Art"" of the non-existent Palace in the background of the shot below. This is one of many Matte Paintings by the Fox FX team, painted on glass in front of the Camera to give the illusion of the ""Palace"" far in the distance.  The other shots show the collapse of a ""Break-away"" building Set and the slow collapse of the huge (miniature) Dam (well over ten feet tall).

PPS ~ Note: I've got to say that I really can't stand it when the studios do a ""remake"" of a Classic Film, and in this case, the remake (""The Rains of Ranchipur"" 1955) is absolutely DREADFUL at best!  From the first scene, it's obviously clear Lana Turner (as Lady Esketh) did not like her role or being involved in this contrived shoot. Seems like she ""phoned in"" all of her lines; IMHO it's her single worst performance in any film that she ever made. Sir Richard Burton is flat-footed and absurd at best in the role of Major Rama Safti, a role that helped elevate Tyrone Power to A-List Stardom. Casting Fred MacMurray as Tom Ransome was about as inspired as casting WC Fields in that role; his scenes are awful and irritating at best. The same goes for casting the great (and poorly-cast) Michael Rennie (probably only because of his English accent) as Lord Albert Esketh... Nigel Bruce nailed it.  ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!""

Bottom line; in spite of horrific two-dimensional acting, this 1955 clunker did get an Oscar nomination for Best FX (for the Earthquake).",1483660800,5,4748,4.800245098039215
