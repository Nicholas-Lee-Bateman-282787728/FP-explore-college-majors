2102873,5,B0002LJTTK,I bought this CD years ago. For some reason it disappeared from my car I asked my husband and my children you can't miss it it's a blue cd the only blue cd I ever had. When he came out with his first Album (cassette)lol!! people use to always steal mine out my car and I will always go right ahead an purchase another one but this one you can't do that I purchase this one @ Walmart years ago and can't find it. So my husband told me to look on amazon and now i'm so happy. Thank You AMAZON!!!,1310169600,,493,3.891089108910891

2102877,5,B0002LJTTK,"Well first of all I have to say this DVD does actually promise you the title, but with bonus!

  I'm sure for a lot of the people out there who are fans of Keith Sweat, know that he has more than just 12 videos, so for it to be identical to his best of cd, they only put those songs, that have music videos on there. The one thing I didn't understand, but I didn't have a problem with was the fact that the DVD features the music video for, ""Keep It Comin'"" but that song isn't even featured on the best of cd, or at least not mines!, but I didn't really have a problem with the fact that they add an extra video. In my opinion I think the least they could've done is actually put more than just 12 of Keith Sweat's videos on here, or maybe some live performances, or at least maybe some special features, but like you know on a lot of these video DVDs, they tend to usually leave out a couple of videos, and sometimes those are the videos that you've been wanting to see, or the DVD just tends to be short because no kinds of extras, but I'd get it, if you want to see videos that no longer get played on BET, or just rarely!

8028854,5,B0002LJTTK,"Love it.  I had the CD and loaned it to someone and it was never returned years ago.  I would say to myself that I should order another CD, because I enjoyed it.  When I was getting ready to order the audio CD, I saw that a DVD was available too.  So, I ordered the DVD and have enjoyed watching it.  However, I may still order the CD to listen to in my vehicles.",1422835200,,363,3.8513513513513513
