This is the only thing that has worked so far for me, with my busy day and unwillingness to  run or diet.  You should try it out, it might be the thing for you.",946598400,23,290,3.8813559322033897
1052309,5,6305608733,"The intro and basic tapes are great workouts by themselves. Beware that there is a HUGE difference between the beginners and advanced tape-- you go from 25 minutes of light impact to 60 minutes of the hardest workout you'll  ever have! Make sure you can complete one tape EASILY before moving up to  the next.
I thought the moves on the advanced tape were harder to master,  but they do provide more of a challenge. You won't get bored soon! If  you're going to invest in a set of workout tapes for the new year, this  should be the one.",946512000,,537,4.33

Both the beginner and 8 minute workouts are great for the new or intermediate Tae-bo  'wanna-bes', I haven't used the Advanced Tae-bo yet.  I've been doing  Tae-bo for 3 months and I haven't felt this good in a long time.  I've lost  about 30 lbs in 4 months and I can thank Tae-bo for most of my success, it  keeps you interested and energized on a daily basis.

1052579,5,6305608733,"Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo workout is amazing and you get visible body results when you pop this disc in your player and work-out with his crew. Plus, the ""patter"" is encouraging, so after a work-out you feel good!, pumped!, positive!, happy!, sweaty!, and endorphin-filled! I have to admit that I don't really like the ""music"", but it doesn't impede the results and is pretty easy to ignore during the workout. The positive results outweigh the negative of music that I don't like. Also, six months ago I hurt my back lifting something heavy in a stupid way, and under the guidance of my physical therapist used this workout to bring my muscles back to solid again.

1052752,4,6305608733,"I used these Tae-Bo tapes everyday for several years many, many moons ago and love, love, loved them!
When I decided to try to get into some kind of shape again I tried a bunch of other, more current workout routines but I couldn't stick with them; they were not fun, or they were too involved or too lacking.
I searched for my old standby, the Tae-Bo tapes and was really happy to find them still available.  I bought them and have used them every day since they arrived - which is longer than I've stuck with any of the other programs I tried..

It's true that the music is.... humorous and lacking but that's not what I bought them for.  I bought them for their effectiveness, easy to pick up and follow routines and the end results.

I would recommend these to any one searching for a workout that is fun, easy to pick up and actually works.

PS - if you don't like the music on the tapes just turn on the stereo or your iPod and listen to the music you like.... after using this a couple of times you don't really need to hear what is being said - you can follow along visually.",1413676800,9,1083,4.1875

I've tried everything from P90X to Insanity to blah, blah blah and of all the workouts I've tried Tae Bo is the only one I've ever actually looked forward to doing.  With all the others I would find myself staring at the play button thinking that I wish my workout was over before it even started.  Tae Bo is challenging but when it's over I don't feel spent, I feel exhilarated and ready to take on the day.  The classic Advanced is my favorite and I love the leg/butt workout at the end.  No the music isn't something I'd listen to on purpose but once I get going on the workout I don't notice it anymore.  Best workout I've ever done, only workout I've ever enjoyed.  And nobody can motivate you like Billy Blanks.  Even when I'm out on a challenging trail run I'll find myself motivating myself by telling myself things that he says in these workouts.  LOL!

1052890,5,6305608733,"Like so many other people  I did the old VHS when it came out in 1999 and I lost over 50 lbs with this dvd for cardio and The Firm's Tough Tape w/ Tracie Long and the ""Wedding Video"" by Cathe Friedrich for weights.  I have been on an nostalgic bent lately regarding exercise and I found a download of the advanced routine and quickly grabbed it. As soon as the class started I got a lump in my throat like seeing old friends again after years apart.(Man, Shellie looks like she is 13!)  Since doing this class I must have done at least 100 other videos but I knew in 10 minutes of viewing that this is still as great now as it was then.

Since this was recorded on video 14 years it will naturally look dated.  Got to love that plush red carpet!  The music actually has held up pretty good but that might just be nostalgia again helping out with that.  One thing many people out there will love about this is there is a whole lot less COUNTING on this one although Billy does count and he does have Shellie count when he is teaching.

The class is 55 minutes.  You have 33 minutes of cardio and then he slightly cools you down for floor work. The next part is the best part about this class the LEGENDARY 11 minute floor leg routine.  Man that thing BURNS! Then there is a quick 5 minutes of abs and then he stretches you out.  As a bonus you stand up and do his ""card work out""  where you take a deck of cards and lay them on the ground and then squat down to pick them up - och.  This part is an add-on and you can just cool down if you want to stop.

If you are new to TaeBo I would go online and view one of his tutorials before trying this even if you are an advanced exerciser.  Beginners should try to locate Tae-Bo Basic first and work up to this one.  If you caught the Tae Bo train late - treat yourself and do this one so you will know what all us oldies are talking about when we say the new dvds are good but not up to snuff with the classic Advanced.",1382400000,2,1964,3.9846547314578005

This time around I have a bit more work to do, and Im excited to receive my DVD in the mail.  Taebo basic is a workout that I felt was more like a spiritual/physical routine.

I am addicted.  These workouts are very easy to follow (basic counting; no fluff) but makes you work up a sweat and gets your heart rate up.

It was not easy, but after a month or so of doing basic I switched to advanced. My body had never looked better, I never felt better about myself! I was simply addicted to this workout! I never received so many compliments in my entire life! I should say, at about the same time I started doing yoga 2-3 times a week. It was a great work out balance. All that happened almost 7 years ago. Now, every time, when I need to shed a few pounds, I know where to go to, not to the gym, but to my bookshelf, where I keep a good collection of Tae-Bo tapes.

I can see a huge diference on the way I feel,  my energy, I feel more confident. I know if I keep doing tae bo I can get to my goal.

If you're determined to lose weight and want to make the effort then tae bo is for you.  I'm kind of addicted to it I have to admit it.  But I enjoy doing it and seing the results.

Billy is an extremely motivational instructor, and you really feel the vibe of the people in the videos.  It pushes you to reach out and grab that little something extra, and when you do and you reach the goal, WOW, it feels AMAZING!

I can't afford costly gym memberships with two babies at home, nor can I find the time to go.  Tae Bo gives me what a gym membership NEVER could!  No weights required, no equipment to use, no worrying about other people watching you workout, haha.  Within weeks, my body was toning up and shaping up in ways I never imagined.  I love my Tae Bo body!  Right after having my first and second babies, I got right back into Tae Bo at 5 weeks after their births and had my abs back in no time at all!

These workouts are not for someone just looking for a mild aerobic benefit.  Tae Bo is for people seeking an exciting workout that WILL keep you motivated.  Billy talks you through the whole thing, it's like he's right there on your shoulder coaching you along, and it is so motivating!  Try it and you will be hooked.  Not a program for the meek, but not too much to handle either.  It is fabulous, wonderful, I just can't say enough!  Hey, it's kept my interest for SEVEN YEARS!

Why?

When you are doing the motions, he stresses doing them correctly, without ""over"" stressing or over explaining. He tries to get across the importance of keeping your muscles tightened, while doing the exercises for maximum benefit.

Easy motions. Easy to follow. I stick with the basic tape and resort to walking when I feel too tired. There's no need to do all the reps if you need a break. It's easy to jump back in and pick up again at any time.

It's short. In under a half hour you get warmed up, exercise and cool down. Sometime in there you gain a little confidence, even energy and feel like you are ready to take on the world again.

I started out with the Instructional tape; it is kind of tedious but necessary in order to get the moves down pat.  I then started with the Basic workout, which was fun.  One day I decided I was going to try the Advanced workout, but when I took one look at how fast Mr Blanks and everyone else was moving in the warmup; I sat down with my mouth hangin' open & thought ""Billy Blanks is truly out of his mind,""  then did the Basic.  Next time I actually did the Advanced, and.....GOOD GRACIOUS ALIVE!!!!  I was sore & achin' right down to my toes!  But know what?  It was still FUN!  My tummy went down in no time flat after doing the workout a few times, every time I do Taebo I feel so energized; then at night I sleep like a rock!  Mr Blanks is such an inspirational person with a beautiful spirit. You can tell his heart is in this.

And for those who have complained about his workouts being unsafe,  the instructional video is to teach the correct techniques so that you don't hurt yourself, so if you don't take the time to learn what you're supposed to then you only have yourself to blame....Billy explicitly states in that video to listen to everything he has to tell you...my advice is this: don't be hardheaded...practice the instructional tape; it contains advice that is absolutely necessary to heed!",1130198400,11,1399,4.421875

Research followed, and I have found page after page of people describing similar injuries as a result of the poor instruction and pacing.

This tidbit stood out:  ""the American Council on Exercise... ...advises that potential Tae Bo users should achieve a solid fitness foundation before beginning their workouts as even basic classes or videos require above average endurance, flexibility, and strength.""

In other words, these videos are potentially unsafe for anybody who isn't already in fairly good shape, or for anybody supporting extra weight on their joints.  Of course, it doesn't say that on the box or in the ads.

He represents an age range between 18 and 45; we see both genders, people who represent the many lifestyles and etnic groups present in contemporary North America. This is an inclusive program.

If you want to look at cute people and a fashion parade, this is not the approach for you.

I think Billy Blanks is sincere with his program, but he is not a very good instructor. This system has been brilliantly marketed to ''everybody'' but his choreography is too complicated and detailed. He moves way too fast, and offers poor explanations of what is going on.

If you want a good workout, less is more. I am very coordinated, and I have almost tripped and pulled muscles. Sometimes his models get tangled up.

I don't suggest throwing out Tai Bo; I think it is a very good program if you have better initial instruction. I was quite impressed with another program called ''tai fit,'' the leader, Lawrence, is a much better instructor. There are a lot of kickboxing-kind-of-things out there, keep practicing.",1125100800,3,1091,4.781914893617022
1053339,4,6305608733,"I've been doing Tae Bo for about 15 months, and have dropped 30 pounds (and counting!).  I started at a very unhealthy 140 pounds (just for reference, I'm 5'4""), and I'm now down to a lean, mean, fighting-machine 110.  I'm in better shape than I've ever been, and I owe it all to Tae Bo!

Before starting Tae Bo, I had tried several other workouts, to no avail.  At one point I was working out with Jane Fonda an hour a day, every day, and was actually gaining weight!  I bought the Tae Bo original 4-pack on a whim, but it sat on my shelf for years before I finally gave it a go - I had watched my sister do it, and it just looked too hard.  Eventually I had trouble squeezing into my fat jeans and, frustrated, I made the commitment to lose some weight and stick with Tae Bo for at least a year.

I began by watching the Instructional video for a week and practicing the moves.  Admittedly, this was rather tedious - the pace is very slow and you end up standing around most of the time.  However, correct form is essential, both to prevent injury and properly work the targeted muscle groups.  Before beginning even a Basic workout, you should definitely run through the Instructional video a few times.  You won't regret it!

Once I had the moves down, I went on to the 30-minute Basic workout, and stuck with it for six months.  I was so horrendously out of shape that I had to stop for breathers, even though Billy gives you plenty of rest in between exercises.  It took quite some time before I was comfortable with the moves, but I did get there.  If you're new to Tae Bo (or to exercising in general), you'll probably find even the Basic workout to be challenging.  Don't give up, though - it might take some time, but you WILL see improvement.  I was very frustrated at first, as I didn't start shedding the pounds right away, and my lack of balance was a significant obstacle.  Around the fourth month, though, I noticed some definite improvement, and was confident enough after month six to move on to the Advanced workout.

Initially, I found the Advanced workout to be difficult, but after a few months I had mastered it as well.  By this time I had lost about 20 pounds and gained a ton of confidence.  I finally retired the original Tae Bo workouts six months ago and moved on to the Get Ripped and Ultimate Abs/Butt series.  After seeing how demanding the newer workouts are, I'm extremely glad I started with the original 4-pack - had I overestimated my abilities, I seriously doubt that I would still be doing Tae Bo.  I probably would have given up within the first week instead!

The Advanced workout, which runs 55 minutes, is paced more quickly than the Basic workout, though it's much slower than, say, the Get Ripped Advanced workout or the Ultimate Abs/Butt DVD.  In addition to the kicking/punching combos that you learn in the Basic workout, you also do some floor work for your abdominals and gluteals.  Billy really introduces a wide variety of exercises during this session, many of which you'll see again if you try out other videos.  This is a great intermediate workout - it really bridges the gap between the Basic workout and the more intense Advanced workouts that he produced later on.

For anyone who's new to Tae Bo, I'd definitely recommend that you pick up this 4-pack before buying anything else.  Each workout builds on the previous one and, when viewed in succession, they offer a great introduction to Tae Bo.  If you try to just jump right in with an Advanced workout, you'll not only get discouraged, but you might even hurt yourself.  For those of you who are shopping around for a new fitness program, look no further - Tae Bo is fun and effective.  Plus, with so many different DVDs available, you'll never get bored or plateau.  Should you find your mind wandering or your weight loss stalling, just try another workout.

A word of caution - Tae Bo certainly isn't without its flaws.  The production quality isn't the best (this is especially true with the earlier videos).  Billy also tends to switch quickly from one move to the next, and to do uneven repetitions on each side (a problem he has yet to resolve).  Nonetheless, this is the best workout series I've tried.  It's transformed me from a couch potato to a fitness freak!",1115683200,26,4284,4.515584415584415
1053340,5,6305608733,"I got the VHS set of this several years ago, and reluctantly tried it out one night. Before I knew it, I was hooked!

I went from around 220 down to 165 in my prime in the area of 6 or 7 months just using the beginner and then the intermediate tapes.

The excercises are easy to follow and once you get the hang of it, its quite enjoyable. I used to look forward to doing my workout every weeknight.

If they worked for me, they certainly can work for you!",1113955200,17,456,3.989010989010989
1053341,5,6305608733,"I have been doing TaeBo faithfully for about 5 years now. This was the first set I bought. I spent about two months on the instructional workout. It was not aerobically challenging for me but I really wanted to have the moves down. I moved on to the Basic Workout, and even though I was already in pretty good shape because I still used my NordicTrak machine while I was learning TaeBo, the Basic workout just about killed me! Once I got going though, I got the ""exercise high"" the first time ever, and I was hooked! I made my friends crazy talking about TaeBo. I spent a few months on the Basic and then moved on to the Advanced. Once again, it just about killed me! I stuck with it, lost about 15 pounds, and am now in great shape. I continue to use the Advanced along with other TaeBo DVDs and am still losing some weight, even though I'm also addicted to chocolate!

If you want a really hard workout, TaeBo Advanced is it! My advice is to take time to learn the moves properly, so you get the best workout possible and avoid injuries. The better your form is, the better your workout will be. Have fun and get fit!",1112918400,9,1119,4.253521126760563
1053342,1,6305608733,"I have done the Tae Bo Cardio tape for a month, and really thought I would like this tape since I could overlook the ""crappiness of production"" in the Cardio DVD.  This DVD is just plain awful.  The basic part, which I assumed was for beginners, immediately launched into superfast motions.  It is also taped in such a way that it looks like the people kept moving normally and they sped up the tape, very strange. It also looks like it was taped at different times and spliced togethor.  The people don't seem to be moving at a natural speed and almost don't seem to match the music, like the routine was done to one workout and they put in the music later.  Since it was labeled ""basic"" I assumed there would be some direction.  There was very little and it was just totally disjointed. I usually feel great after doing the cardio DVD, but just felt hurt after doing the Basic (yet I wasn't at all sweaty or tired..just felt like I hurt myself).  I do not suggest this for beginners (I would suggest the Cardio one)  And I'm not sure why would want to buy it for the Advanced portion given the price. You could buy several other versions of Tae-Bo for the same price.",1112227200,5,1169,4.354838709677419

If your a beginner start with the instructional tape master it and work your way to the next one. Technique is key. Good luck just stick to it and you will see the weight go.,1110153600,7,439,3.7311827956989245
1053344,3,6305608733,"These videos are still going strong but I honestly like the 8 min. workout the best in this set.  As double time feels stupid and awkward!  I, however, can't look over a lot of the mistakes these videos make (mostly the miscounting of reps on each side) and rarely use this set.  I will do the 8 min one as it kicks but butt more than the Advanced videos but personally I think the Tae-Bo Live set is much better and also his Tae Bo II Ripped series is excellent.  I have the basic and love it.  I would recommend upping to a new version of Tae Bo as there are lots out there and skip these originals as they have many flaws.

**One benefit of all the TAE BO workouts is the ab factor.  You will find muscles you didn't know you had!  Is excellent for that!**",1108857600,6,759,4.081081081081081
1053345,5,6305608733,"I am a huge fan of Billy Blanks and all of his videos.  I originally started working out with his Crunch kickboxing video a few years ago and immediately got hooked.  I lost 40 pounds doing his tape 4 days a week and reducing my calorie intake.  Eventually I was ready to start with one of his advanced tapes, which totally kicked my butt!  The tape was about an hour long filled with some highly intense moves so I started doing half the workout one day and the other half the next day until I was able to do the entire thing.

Unfortunately, I fell off the weight loss & fitness bandwagon for a couple of years when I got pregnant with my second child.  I gained a bunch of weight back after my daughter was born after starting a new office job so I ended up at an all time high.  About a month ago I started back on my diet and have a date with Tae Bo Basic 5 days a week.  At first it was really hard to keep up with it because even the Basic really kicks your butt and makes you sweat, but now I am really into it and I force myself to spend the half hour with this tape almost every day.  So far I've lost 8 lbs, but I still have another 50 or so to go.  If you are out of shape like I was, give yourself a couple of weeks to get used to the video and do things at your own pace.

The thing I like most about this video is that the routines only consist of no more than 2-3 steps.  I've tried other aerobics and kick boxing videos and the moves were just too complicated so I gave up on them.  I am not that coordinated so I need to have things more simple.  :)  Besides that, Billy is very energetic and the moves are so much fun!  Also, I like the fact that you see Billy and his back ups sweating, trying hard, and stopping for water breaks.  Also, there is a little girl and an old lady in the video, as well as some heavier set people.  This makes the people seem a lot more ""real"" than the people in the other videos I've tried.

I know some people may complain that the Basic video is only 30 minutes, but when you work a full time job, have 2 kids and a husband, it's really nice to not have to spend hours working out each day to have a fulfilling workout.  I don't get home until 6:30 so after doing this workout I'm done by 7:00, which is when I start making dinner.  By 8:00-8:30 it's finally time to sit down and relax with my family before we all go to bed around 9 or 10.

As far as the music goes, yes it is kind of cheesy, 80's type music, but at least it's energetic and goes along with the video.  Most of the time I put on a Shania Twain CD or some other energetic CD to listen to instead.  You can have your CD on a low volume and still hear Billy's instructions.

One thing I wish the Basic video had was a longer cool down.  I usually sit and stretch out my arms and legs afterwards for a few minutes so I don't get sore.

Overall, I am very pleased with Billy's workouts and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to get fit and have fun!  I am currently shopping Amazon to see what other Tae Bo workouts I can get my hands on.  I know he's got a new Boot Camp set out so I think I might try that!  I can't wait until I get to where I want to be and see how great my body looks!",1106870400,13,3211,3.8953846153846152
1053386,3,6305608733,"Tae Bo was at one time the hottest fitness craze in the country. This DVD has the four workouts that started it all. Tae Bo is effective and fun as are these workouts. However, the way these videos were filmed is awful, which is why this only earns three stars for me. The lighting is either too dim or is dominated by a strobe light. Blanks' cueing is not very good; he directs you to use your right or left arm, for example, based on what he is doing in the studio, not on how you will be mirroring him at home. There are numerous distracting mistakes where either Blanks or one of the other exercisers gets lost. The music is worse than most fitness videos. Blanks' no-nonsense, yet supportive personality, however, shines. I really enjoy him as an instructor.

The Instructional workout is important to do in order to insure that you are completing the moves with the correct form. Do it once and then dive into the Basic workout. If you are new to kickboxing or exercise in general, this will give you a nice workout. I quickly outgrew this workout, however, because it is just too short at less than 30 minutes. The Advanced workout at almost an hour long is VERY advanced. There are times when the kicks are so fast that it is easy to lose proper form. There are twenty tough minutes of floor exercises that target your glutes, hips, and thighs at the end of the kickboxing segment. Blanks includes ab exercises, as well, but I find them to be inadequate. The 8 Minute Workout is actually 14-minutes long when you include the warm-up and cool-down. I found that it was the most useful to do as an addition to the Basic workout to create a more intermediate-level workout.

The more recent Tae Bo workouts are far better produced and Blanks has much improved his cueing. Buy this DVD on the strength of the workouts, but don't expect much in terms of the appearance of the set, cueing, etc.",1105574400,5,1896,4.476878612716763

The Advanced workout is tough but definitely worth it. The floor exercises are perfect for people wanting to trim the fat from their butt and thighs. The workouts are fun and work every muscle group.

1053388,5,6305608733,"I am a TAE BO fanatic. I have been an athlete all my life and preferably doing team sports (volleyball, basketball etc). Once I started professional life, long hours at the office and other daily obligations minimized the time I had left to exercise close to zero. From exercising 8 hours a week, I came down to zero - except the occasional trip to the gym - for many years. You can understand that my body was not as toned as it has been throughout my life. Then I discovered home videos. Not that they gave me the athletic body I once had, but at least they helped maintained some low level of fitness. I have a huge collection and have not used any tape/dvd more than once. They are all extremely boring except a few exceptions that work the bottocks area - but they also end up being boring.

Then I came across Tae Bo. I have almost all Billy Bank's tae bo dvd. I have become a tae bo addict and I am loving it. What is more, Tae Bo has helped me to gain my exercising routine back, get back into shape even if I have to do it alone. The most important thing it did, is that it gave me the confidence that I can do it. I can exercise again. Tae bo as my basic exercise routine really boosted my self confidence. It made my visits to the gym more frequent, especially for tae bo classes.

Since it has allowed me to enjoy exercise on my own, I now have taken up running and I am ready to take-up marathon training. Tae Bo is more an exercise routine, it is a whole philosophy behind it, and Billy Banks is now one of my most trusted friends. He can be  yours too if you let him. I strongly recommend also to read his book. As far as his tapes are concerned, all his tapes are well produced, executed, the instructional videos are a must and the results, are amazing. Even after the 2nd or 3rd time you will do them, you can start feeling results (provided that there is only a day or two elapse time between the sessions)

I guarrantee that if you include tae bo in your daily schedule your quality of life will improve dramatically. (Tip: For those who are heavy smokers and do not feel they have the cardio endurance to keep up with the training regime, I strongly recommend Alen Carr's quit smoking series)",1098662400,6,2213,4.224586288416075

It is a pretty good deal to get all four of them in one. The first one is pretty boring, with instructions on how to do each move. If you have every done a Billy Blanks video before, you probably know 95% of the moves already anyway. I am still working my way through the Basic video, which gets me working up a pretty good sweat. It would be nice, though, if it was a little longer. With the warm-up and cool-down, it is probably 30 minutes long. But the 4pack also includes a more high energy 8 minute workout, which I have been trying to do in addition to the Basic so I feel like I have exercised enough. I briefly scanned the Advanced workout and am pretty sure that I am NOT ready for it yet. But hopefully I will get there soon.

Within 1 month of bringing Tae-Bo into my normal workout line-up (30 minutes of cardio warm-up prior to either the advanced or basic tapes 4 times a week), I dropped inches around my hips and gained noticable definition in my arms and stomach while still eating as I normally do. Now I use it year-round to help me prepare for the outdoor running season.
The trick to getting all you can out of each workout is to concentrate on doing the moves properly and at your own pace until you can work through all the reps of each routine. I promise it too will leave you huffing and puffing no matter what your fitness level.

Plus my class schedule has so many 8-5 days in it that I don't have time to hit the gym. SO, I decided just after Thanksgiving to start doing a workout tape regime that would kill less time and still keep me in shape.
My first tape...Callanetics. Great sculpting workout, but no cardio. The immediate first thought...Tae Bo. I have a lot of friends who sang the praises of Billy Blanks, but I had yet to see myself what cardio kickboxing was all about. I bought the DVD version (1) because it was actually cheaper than the tapes and (2) had all the tapes rolled up into one slim package that would probably last longer anyway.
I did what the instructions told me and did the introductory workout first. This teaches you the basics of the moves he likes to incorporate into the routines. Although I feel that he could have explained some of the positions better (i.e., when you do the roundhouse kicks, turn the foot you're standing on OUT...it will help twist your hips down so you can lift your leg as high as possible while working out your gluteal muscles...he doesn't emphasize this, just tells you to keep your hand on your hip and kick to the side), you find out his workout is relatively simple in technique. However, he warns you that he CAN and WILL make it more PHYSICALLY difficult as you progress.
I then advanced to the basics workout. Being an avid runner and gym rat, I found this to be a pretty decent workout. Built up a respectable sweat and felt empowered...just pictured kicking ex-boyfriends in the face. :) Plus, I surprised myself with how fierce I can feel...really lets out stress and remains fun.
The advanced workout...whoa.  Not for the faint of heart.  45 minutes of cardio with many many many fast sequences of kicks and jabs that will make you feel like a puppet being yanked in eight different directions...it's great.  :)  Then, the floor work...you probably have never done so many doggy-lifts in your life!

Concerns that we have: Billy's warm-ups are dangerously fast. We always do our own warm ups before doing his. It's a little tricky to get all the moves and be sure we're doing them right. Form is very important because improper form could easily lead to injury.
The video promised that if we were not satisfied within the first 30 days, we could return it for our money back. This was NOT the case when we tried to return it since we had opened it. (How do you know if you like something if you haven't tried it?)
If you can, get a hold of a copy of this from someone and try it out before committing so much money. You may love it, but it's better to find out before investing.",1037145600,10,985,4.301075268817204

I thought it funny at the time, but about 3 days later, I opened up the tapes, popped one in, and yes, despite myself, I started imagining his cheating face as I practiced the punching and kicking moves.

I feel stronger and more energized than ever before.  I love this work-out!  I bought the original tapes in 1999, but I got stuck on the instructional tape and eventually got bored and quit.  I started back on June 1, 2002 and it has been such a blessing for me and my friends. Since then, I moved on to the Live versions of Tae Bo.  My arm and leg muscles are becoming more defined and they now have some resemblance of the way they looked when I was 20 years younger.  I have not changed my diet as of yet,  but I am still losing weight at a rate of approximately one and an half pounds per week.  I do Tae Bo four-six times a week and I enjoy every minute of it.  I look better than I have in a long, long time.  Thank God for Billy Blanks!  Thank God for Tae Bo!!",1028332800,20,936,3.9731182795698925

First there is no need to advertise it like they are giving you 4 videos because for me it is really one.  I looked at the instructional once, did the beginner a couple of times, and felt the 8-min was a waste of 8 mintues!  I only use the advanced and even that I usually dread doing it. For starters it is way too long and gets boring over time.  Billy is totally unorganized, first he tells you to do 3 sets on one side and then makes you do 6 on the other (usually because he is spending the time talking to the camera and loses track of what is going on) It is obvious that this session was thrown together and no preperation time was put into it.  As a result this is a poor quality work-out tape.  I will never buy anymore tae bo tapes from Billy Blanks again just not worth the money",1027900800,14,966,3.9740932642487046

Once I moved to the basic workout, it was more enjoyable then the instruction chapter and I realized it works out all part of my body, that motivated me to stick to it.  Now I am in the advanced level...Now that is a workout!  You will sweat like crazy and you will feel those abs, butts, legs burning.  Billy constant motivational speech make you push yourself harder and harder!  I swear that after only a few weeks of doing Tae Bo 5 times a week, people started to tell me I look Thinner...and my clothes fit better...So if you are looking for a good workout that really motivate you to give your all, this is the one!

It's boring to sit in a stretch for a couple minutes and eats up tape time, so I suppose they don't bother with it.  He also doesn't explain stretching technique, and even shows bouncing in a stretch, which can really hurt an out-of-shape person.
Then, getting into the workout, while it looks fun with several people doing it, just one person looks kind of lame at it.  I'm a librarian, and these videos are constantly in demand by people who have never tried them, but they are always returned quickly because they end up not liking them.  The workout focuses on a few muscle groups, but doesn't balance the body well.

I may stray from Tae Bo from time to time, but always come back.  The most valuable video in the set is the Basic.  It is a good, short workout.  The instructional video is good to watch once.  The advanced workout is REALLY advanced and many of the moves are HARD to do.  When the Basic video became a little too ""basic"" for me, I turned to the advanced version and found I couldn't do it.  However, it did give me ideas to advance the basic version on my own.  I incorporate some of the additions in the advanced version to the basic to make it a more challenging, more effective workout.  I have never done anything but watch through the 8 minute video.  If I can only work out for 8 minutes, I find it's not worth my time.

1053566,2,6305608733,"I was quite disappointed in this video, and expected a lot more thanks to all the media hype. Actually, this is a very poor quality workout video for many reasons...All B. Blanks does is count 1 to 8 from start to finish, yell ""come on"" all the time, which is sooo annoying, and provides very little fitness education. You really don't even need the Instructional video at all, since the moves aren't that complicated, so the 4-pack is a waste of money. Don't expect to get a good work-out in 8 minutes either. You have to work out at least 30 minutes at a time, at least 3 days a week, to see any benefit.
The music is awful, and the moves aren't even coordinated with it. When the moves are double-timed, it's impossible to keep up, the moves are frantic and unsafe, and even the exercisers on the video aren't keeping up. B. Blanks spends most of the video saying ""come on, come on girl"" rather than exercising, and he almost never exercises through the double-timed moves.
I gave this video 2 stars rather than one because you probably will lose weight doing it, but I've done a lot of exercise videos and think that there are a lot better, safer exercise videos out there where the instructors are more interesting and the moves more organized overall. Another thing that annoyed me about this video was the exercising AFTER a cool-down. Very strange.

Seven months later I have lost 30 lbs and I now fit comfortably in a size six.  Now you do have to be faithful to the work out.  The first two months I did the beginners tape five times a week.  When I move up to the advance tape I cut down to three times a week because it is so much harder.  I am over 40 and  believe me I never thought I would see single digit clothes sizes again.  So give it a try.  Young or old.  If you need inspiration there is a 75 year old lady in the advance Tae Bo tape who keeps up.

1053569,4,6305608733,"Tae Bo is an awesome workout (This coming from a 13 year old girl) I started doing Tae-Bo a few weeks ago, and In the first week, I saw PHYSICAL results.
  I'm the kind of girl that likes to do excersize video's when I'm not doing my 2 season's of sports. And in the past, I have tried multiple other video's that claim they are ""total body"", but fall short.
  As a teenager, I'm very self-concious about my appearance. I have a muscular frame, so as ""weight"" goes, I'm about 10 pounds overweight (I don't look it though)I use excersize for part of my confidence. I feel good because, even If I'm not losing weight, I am excersizing, and I know that's good for my body.
  With the past video's I have tried, my main problem is my muscular legs. They aren't as tiny as the other girls in my school, so I was hoping Tae-Bo would help me tighten them up so even if my legs aren't as tiny as the next girls, they are tight and look good. And Tae-Bo is the only excersize program that has acheived that. It truly is the only excersize program that really WORKS to tighten muscles.
  In the first week, I noticed my inner part of my upper thighs were TIGHT for once. And I actually have muscle in my arms! (My mom has NO upper body strength and I inheireted that)
  Another thing that Tae-Bo does is keeps my heart rate up. I also run, to help me train for my sports, and I assumed that If I just did Tae-Bo, and not run, that when I started to run, I wouldn't be in shape and I would be all outta breath. But that is not so. Tae Bo keeps me at the same heart rate as JOGGING! It's great. So as I am working out and tightening muscles, Tae-Bo also helps me with my running.
  I gave it 4 starts instead of five because I haven't ""lost weight"" as the program claims. But I've only been doing the video's for a little less than a month. So a little word of advice: If you want to loose 50 lbs or whatever, this probably isn't the right program for you. But if you DO want to tighen and firm muscles so you LOOK better, this program is for you!",1005350400,7,2035,4.085427135678392

This workout is tough!  I spent weeks on just the beginner portion of the DVD.  The pace is great, just when you think you can't go on, it changes.

1053571,4,6305608733,"I'm a TaeKwonDo instructor from the US living in Korea. I've been here for 6 years. I started doing the Tae-Bo DVD with my wife. She's not very athletically inclined so she thought this would be a good way to get in shape. I find it hard to believe some of complaints I've seen about this series. Who cares about the production quality or the fact that the music isn't something popular? The point of this series is to get a workout and I for one think it delivers. Some people complain about injuring themselves or about the moves being impossible to perform. I've also noticed some of those complain about the level of the workouts. Obviously, it's hard to ramp up from absolute beginner to professional athlete in just 4 tapes. As a martial arts instructor I would offer this advice. Start with the Instructional video. Do it all the way through. Practice the techniques. Do them on both sides. Use that as your workout for at least two weeks. Watch the way techniques are done and make sure you are doing them correctly. I would be willing to bet that people who injured themselves did so because of poor technique or trying to do too much, too quickly. By the end, you might want to do it twice through each day. Then step up to the beginner workout. If you find it difficult, put it on pause for a few minutes, catch your breath and then keep going. Actually, Mr. Blanks suggests that himself on the video. After you can comfortably do the Basic workout (at least 1 month after, probably more for older adults), add the 8-minute workout to it. I would suggest doing the 8-minute workout first, then the Basic. When you've adjusted to that, do the Basic workout twice in succession each day. Then, when you can do that comfortably, go to the Advanced workout. As a workout, I think it's excellent. From a self-defense standpoint, I wouldn't really recommend it. Of course there is some protection benefit from learning basic techniques and getting in shape but he teaches these techniques from a workout perspective not proper martial arts technique. As one example, he stresses that when you execute techniques you should tighten up various muscles. This creates more resistance and so gives a better workout. This also slows your techniques down. When practicing martial arts, you want to stay loose until the point of impact. This gives you more speed and ultimately more power. If you really want to learn self-defense, take a martial arts class and stick with it.
As a last point and small pet peeve, Koreans actually pronounce TaeKwonDo just as it looks with Tae sounding like Day not Tie. I think this got confused with Thai kickboxing early on and just got spread that way.
In summary, if you want good production quality, go sit on the couch and watch Titanic again. If you want to learn self-defense, go to a martial arts class. If you want an excellent series of workout videos, buy Tae-Bo.",1000771200,429,2906,4.644660194174757

1053573,4,6305608733,"I knew some kickboxing techniques before I bought this pack (Kathy Smith's Kickboxing for one, which is amazing), so I only scanned the instructional tape.  But if you have never done this before, then use the instructional tape a few times before progressing.  The basic tape is a solid workout that helps develop the muscles you need to do the advanced tape.
The advanced tape is a very strong workout.  At first I thought his inspirational motivation was kind of hokey, but as the workout progressed, I really started to like it.  During the floor work, which is very challenging, he really keeps me going.  There is one exercise, however, that smarts and it feels like he talks forever.  But I keep with it and have really seen my body become more developed and my balance is a lot stronger.
My only complaint is that there is not any streching.  In the advanced tape there is one strech after the leg work, which is definitely not sufficient.  The tape ends with squats which are a great way to cool down, but then it just stops.  I stretch on my own, because I feel that stretching is an integral part of exercising.
Overall, this is a great workout.  When I first started kickboxing workouts, I was frustrated because it took me a few times to get the moves and it took me even longer to get strong enough to really work the moves.  But it is worth it.  I feel stronger, more centered and definitely look stronger and more defined.",998006400,10,1438,4.5096525096525095

I got this set as a gift about a year and a half ago and it's made a ton of difference in my exercise routine.  Now I actually have one!
For starters, I should say I don't think this is a workout for everyone.  My friends used this series on and off but didn't take to it as quickly or as enthusiastically as I did.  If you're not into kickboxing or karate, this probably isn't the series for you.  Some of my friends, for instance, preferred more straight up aerobic workouts, and others preferred workouts with more coordinated dance elements.  So it's a personal choice if you want to do kickboxing.  I would only suggest taking this up if you like kickboxing and/or karate.
That said, if you have a martial arts background, this is the workout for you!  Even if you don't have a martial arts background, but are interested in learning basic moves, this is a great series.  Billy Blanks is the real deal.  You can tell by his form that this guy knows his martial arts!  This may explain why I like this series so much.  I took karate for three years as a kid.  Accordingly, I think I took to learning the moves in this workout more easily than most of my friends.  I found the instructional video to be a total waste of time.  My friends without martial arts backgrounds said it was helpful, but only worth watching once, maybe two times max.  I did the basic workout for a couple of weeks, and then got bored and moved on to the advance.  Some of my friends have never tackled the advance and continue to stick to the basic workout.  It's hard to say whether the basic gives you a good workout or not.  My friends say it does, but I don't feel like it does at all.  Again, this may have to do with one's comfort level with the martial arts.  I'm not sure.
The bulk of my praise is reserved for the advance workout.  This baby is an hour long and really kicks your butt, no matter what your fitness level!  I got into the groove of doing the advance five times a week, and I swear I was never as fit as I was then.  Of course, like all workouts, it gets monotonous after a while, so I don't do it as often as I used too.  I mostly run now (about 15 miles a week), but every once in a while, I'll pull out my advance Tae Bo tape, and it still kicks my butt every time!  It's ridiculously hard, but so incredibly worthwhile.  I always wake up the next morning a little sore from doing the advance tae bo workout and I love it.",998006400,16,2586,4.190669371196755

First thing I did was to figure out my ""concentric plane.""  This seems elementary, and looks a lot like what we used to call a ""jellyfish.""  But it is essential to balance--both physical and of a more spiritual variety.  From then on, the rest was--well, I won't say ""easy.""  But perhaps mercilessly comprehensible.  Tae-Bo (or, Tai-Boh) is a thrilling and philosophically indeterminate style of fight-condition-training-type-thing that has the effect of leaning heavily on certain precepts of more familiar martial arts (such as Tae-Kwon-Do [or Tai-kawan-doh], Aikido [or ah-i-ki-doh], Karate [or karah-teh], judo [or jigorokano], and the like)  while managing to dress its masters and acolytes in spandex of many lurid colors.

1053684,4,6305608733,"For the last ten years, I have tried more than 15 different workouts starting form Jane Fonda's workout and ending with Cindy Crawford's Shape your body, but I assure you that the Tae-bo basics and advanced tapes are something different. After only two days of excercising the advanced tape, I felt that my body has become more firm and strong. Yet I advice any one who has not been excercising for a long time to start with the the Tae-bo basic for one week at least before getting into the advanced workout, other wise it will cause you severe injury. Tae-bo gives a total body burning workout, and helps you to lose weight along side with a suitable diet, but it does not spot train some of the areas that you need most. To get the best results, I personally alternate between the best different workouts that I have, for example, I make two days of the week for a total workout like Tae-bo, another two days for yoga excercises,and the rest of the week for a spot workout that concentrates on certain problem areas such as Cindy Crawford's Shape Your Body. My sincere advice to any one is to never believe that one kind of a work out can solve all your problems, you have to train your body, and make it used to practicing more than one kind of a workout. The Tae-bo is exciting, energizing, and raises your enthusiasm, it makes you sweat a lot and helps you lose a bit of weight,it makes you feel better about yourself and it has helped me personally to reduce a lot of depression, but it does not reshape your body. Its disadvantage is that it is tiring and very tough. I've practiced it alone for two months. It helped me in burning some excess fat, but it did not shape my body in the beautiful shape that I desired. Along with other excersises it worked very effectively for me, but I only lost 3 pounds in 2 months and a half. Most important, Tae-bo is effective, but it is not magic as the advertisment says!",984441600,19,1919,4.393258426966292

I didn't lose 1 pound; unwanted weight was continuous for several months.  My weight before estrogen 135 lbs., and 4 months later my weight with estrogen 190 lbs.

The 8-minute workout is more like ""cheating"". I have found that I can make the Basic workout into a very good session by concentrating on form and putting some strength into my punches.  I definitely fatigue a wide variety of muscles, and feel confident and powerful after each and every workout.

That's why these DVDs are so incredibly great. They have the training section, the intro section, the advanced section, even the quick-and-easy section, and you can jump to whichever one you want with the touch of a button.
Once you're there, the exercises are really interesting and draw you in. This isn't just doing 8000 sit-ups in a row ... there are different moves, things to keep you interested and having fun. It's definitely something that different ages or sexes can do together - there's something for everyone. It's not ""girly"" and it's not ""macho"".

Tae-Bo is amazing because it allows you to take your frustration, anger, fears, etc. and channel them into something productive: getting in shape.  Billy Blanks keeps you motivated throughout the entire workout.  The workout is energizing and so much FUN!  I cannot imagine going back to regular and step aerobics.  This might sound crazy, but Tae-Bo has become a way of life.  I work out about 6 times a week or whenever I can find the time.  Every day, I notice more and more definition in my abs.  I punch harder and kick higher with every workout.  My skin has a glow to it now.  I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SWIMSUIT SEASON!  I'm not tired anymore and my energy is off the charts!  My self esteem and confidence levels have sky rocketed.  I used to walk with my head down, staring at the sidewalk.  NOT ANYMORE!  Tae-Bo is the most empowering thing that I have ever done for myself.  I'm not afraid to walk across campus after night classes anymore.  This is not just another fad.  Tae-Bo has actually been around for about a decade already and it's not going anywhere.  I will continue to do this workout for the rest of my life.  Still skeptical?  Visit the Tae-Bo website and then, give Billy 30 days.  If you have the will to get into shape, this is the way to go.",979171200,23,1557,4.378947368421053

Another thing:  it is a good workout if you can follow all the instructions.  For example to get your tummy toned, YOU have to flex your stomach muscles while you do all the other moves.

1053751,5,6305608733,"I bought this 4-pack of Taebo almost 2 years ago - January 1999 and I am still using Taebo today after almost 2 years and 52 pounds ago.  I recommend Taebo to everyone I know who is serious about losing weight, getting in shape and being healthy.  I only watched the Instructional tape twice but do recommend that people do this several more times than I did.  I used the Basic tape for 4-5 months before starting on the Advanced.  I like the Basic tape but I think some of the faster moves at the end may be a bit too quick for a Basic tape.  Remember to always go at your own pace.  The Advanced tape is awesome.  The first time I did it (and I paused the tape often) it was very difficult but I put it down for a while and when I picked up it I couldn't believe my increased stamina, endurance and strength.  I must admit that I have never done the 8 minute workout.  If I'm going to sweat, it is going to be longer that 8 minutes so I really can't recommend it.  To the other reviewer who asked for more Taebo tapes -- there are more.  Unfortunately, Amazon does not carry them.  They are available only through the Taebo website.  I have 14 Advanced Taebo tapes (yes, I am addicted) but the Advanced tape in this 4 pack is one of my favorites. The moves are much slower that some of Billy's newer tapes and it helps me focus on what I am doing.  Plus, it only gives me a sense of where I started.  I won't say the Advanced is easy but I have come a long way and can now do this tape all the way through without pausing the tape and it used to initimate me.  Taebo is an amazing workout.  It has slimmed and toned every part of my body: abs, thighs, arms, back, chest, calves, butt, etc.  Someone recently asked me if I was lifting weights because of the definition in my arms but all my toning is from Taebo.  I workout 6 days a week doing the Advanced tape and I've never been in better shape.  Even after almost two years, Taebo is still challenging and never boring.  If I feel sluggish or tired, all I have to do is an hour of Taebo and I'm refreshed.  If your New Years Resolution for 2001 is to lose weight, get in shape or get healthy, please buy these tapes.  I wish I discovered Taebo sooner.  I have gone from a size 18 to a size 10 and I'm still losing.  My life is much better now. I'm more confident and more outgoing.  Please realize that working out is not easy.  There is NO QUICK FIX to losing weight and being healthy.  You have to work at it everyday but Taebo is fun, explosive, challenging and inspirational.

I have been using the tapes for a year and feel as fit and healthy as when I was burning up time at the health club.  Tae-Bo focuses on overall body development and one must focus on abs, form, and breathing.  The instruction is easy to follow, but it takes time to master the proper way of executing the exercise.

I also like the quick warm-up and the yoga-ish cool-down -- they are just the right length.

1053755,5,6305608733,"A year ago I bought the four-pack of Tae-Bo. I worked on the instructional video for about 2 weeks, and moved on to the basic workout.
After two months an accident happened with this basic workout tape. I accidentally recorded a film on it, because my video recorder had a defect, so that it did not react on the protection. ""Oh, well"", I thought, ""I still have the advanced tape."" So I started with it. Oh boy! Was that heavy! Tae-Bo had me hooked, though, and so I kept at it. I have done this advanced tape for about 9 months now, 3 times a week. And what an amazing result it has on my body! I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the mirror after about 3 months, and my body is STILL toning.
Usually things like Tae-Bo are for young people. I am 45 years old, soon to be 46, and I would not believe that I could have such a tremendous condition on my age. My condition is better than it has EVER been!
The reason why I started with Tae-Bo was what Billy Blanks said in his book. He made the remark, that 'people talk a lot about will-power. What they do not realize is that will does not come with the power already installed. You must install the power of the will yourself, by stretching what you believe you can do, and pushing yourself to the limit.' It were THESE words that made me decide to try Tae-Bo, and kept me going. I see every workout of Tae-Bo as a new challenge, trying to improve the movements more and more, and trying to pay attention as much as possible, so that especially my will is challenged.
And, indeed, the will DOES GET power. What I notice is that it extends more and more to other areas of my life. I used to sleep for 9 hours a day. This has now become somewhere between 6 and 7 hours, giving me extra hours to do all kinds of studies. (I do a lot of studying in mathematics, physics and computer programming.) And because my will-power has increased, I am more prepared, and now able to take on ever toucher problems, both in mathematics, physics and in programming.
To me, these benefits are even greater than just being into shape, and having a well-toned body.
I have one tip for those who want to start the advanced workout as soon as possible. The trouble is the tempo of the video that causes you to get out of breath. I have a solution to this problem, though. I have also followed the course ""Personal Power II"" of Anthony Robbins. In it there is a breathing exercise. (Inhale for 7 counts as deep as possible, hold your breath for 28 counts, and then exhale for 14 counts. Do this 10 times per session, 3 times a day. This takes about 10 minutes per exercise, so that you need to spend 1/2 hour a day on this particular exercise. That is, if you commit yourself to do this.) What I have discovered, is that this particular exercise gave my lungs such a good workout, that it enabled me to start this advanced video indeed as fast as I did without major problems, despite my age, and despite the fact that the only training I had were those 2 months of the basic workout. This exercise will help you not to be out of breath so fast when the exercises, especially at the end of the hour, becomes really tough.",971222400,42,3158,4.256239600665557

1053758,3,6305608733,"...Tae-bo is excellent. I have tendonitis in my right knee due to many years of basketball. As a result it's often difficult to find a good  workout that doesn't jar my knee. Aerboics often contains too much jumping.  I realize every knee problem differs, but I have used the Tae-bo basics  tape on a daily basis without knee pain.
I must say, I'm not sure buying  the four-pack tape set was necessary. I used the Instructional Tape once.  The information contained here is important but if known beforehand, owning  the tape is a moot point. The gist of it is, don't overextend your joints  while kicking and punching.
I've used the 8 minute workout when I get up  late in the morning. However, I almost wish I didn't have the option as it  creates greater opportunity to slack off. 8 minutes really isn't enough to  get your heart rate up to a point of significance, in terms of  exercise.
The Advanced Tape is really hard! Also, this one tended to hurt  my knees. There are some lunging moves, and a whole lot of floor exercises  that require you to kneel for lengthy periods of time. I think the decision  on whether this tape is a good investment really depends on the level of  activity you are looking for in an exercise video. This tape is long and  strenuous, but I'm certain if you use it regularly you'd be very fit.  Personally, I've never found the time commitment or the desire to use this  tape more than a couple times.
Tae-bo Basics I would rate as five stars.  Buying the four pack really depends on individual interest, I can only  offer my experience with the pack. On a side note, the music is pretty  goofy, but I like Billy's positive attitude.",967161600,115,1667,4.49

1053836,4,6305608733,"DVD is a great medium for workout videos.  You can instantly go to any workout (although there are not chapters within each workout - which makes sense when you think about it).  There is no tape to wear out and  repurchase, which, with something you watch every other day or so, is a  nice feature in itself.
The instructional workout is actually a little  harder than the basic full speed workout as you are moving through the  excercises in almost slow motion.  However, it is invaluable for learning  the correct form for each movement.
Be warned (in a good way) that this  is not the aerobics workout from the mid-eighties.  It feels like practice  for a sport rather than modified dance and makes you feel more powerful  when you have mastered the kick, punches and combinations.  Be careful of  hyperextending knees and elbows (which Billy Blanks stresses several times  in the instructional section).
These workouts make a nice complement to  weight training.  And remember this - Billy Blanks does not look like he  does from just doing aerobic excercise.

I can run 3-5 miles without a problem and then go for 30-45 minutes of circuit weight training. I can honestly say  that the Taebo dvd set does offer a challenge, but not as much for the  advanced athelete. This is not a true kickboxing or martial arts program so  comparing Taebo to them is a bit unfair. It's strictly an aerobics type  exercise that uses some elements of various martial arts to bring up your  heart rate so it should be evaluated as such. In this way, it does its job  pretty well. The basics section did fairly well in demonstrating the basic  methods of punching and kicking, but it didn't cover everything. I'd hope  it would cover most of the combos in the later tapes so that I wouldn't  feel awkward doing them. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The beginners  section of the dvd offers a good workout. Nice slow pace and adequate  amount of exercise time. Intermediates or advanced people will feel this  section too short like I did. Finally, the advanced section really makes  you sweat, but then again, I did do the basics, beginners, and advanced  section consecutively to give myself a better workout. There are some parts  to the advance workout where the moves feel awkward at first. I wish they  had  covered some of these moves that don't feel natural in the basics  tapes to give me some time to practice them.  Anyways, as for the dvd  itself, all four tapes are copied unto one yellow covered disc. Nice though  somewhat tacky looking. The video itself leaves something to be desired as  there is alot of noticeable shimmering and artifacting during switching  scenes. It gets kinda annoying, but then I didn't buy this dvd for its  looks but the workout it offers. I also had some problems with audio  dropping off a little, but it may just be my disc. What's also nice is that  there is chapter searching on the disc though it might not be evident at  first since there's no chapter search in the main selection page. Makes  being able to go through all four tapes a breeze when you want to do the  whole workout together like I did. I used this disc mainly as a supplement  myself to my weight training and running just to add variety cause we all  know we won't look like Billy Blanks just from Taebo, right? Right!  ;)",954028800,36,2368,4.537914691943128
1053910,5,6305608733,"I have all of the 4 tapes. I am currently on the basic tape for past 3 weeks, hopefully next week I will try the advanced. But the basic tape is challenging, it is a great cardio workout. I also work with some weights  for strength training. But I highly recommend the tapes. I also strongly  recommend the instructional video. Watch that first!  It takes a while to  get used to the pace of the basic, but i have noticed i have more energy,  loss of weight,and I feel great. It is fun too. But recommend using the  tapes in order. When you get to basic, stick with that for at least 2 weeks  before moving to advanced.",953856000,9,619,4.194915254237288
1053911,3,6305608733,"Having taken kickboxing classes and other martial arts classes before, I purchased the Billy Blanks tape to supplement my workouts and/or to serve as a replacement on the nights when I missed class. I must have  overestimated my abilities b/c I have found the classes to be more  challenging than Billy Blanks' tapes, and his teaching style to be dry.  After progressing through the whole series, I bought his Crunch tv  Kickology Jam tape for ten bucks, thinking this would provide more of a  workout. Instead it's the same routine and same boring music, only the box  is packaged differently and you get to sparr with a friend.
If you are  looking for a high-impact, cardio routine (similar to an aerobics class), I  would strongly suggest finding a gym that offers these classes where you  can follow an instructor who will let you know if you are executing the  moves correctly and teach you different ways to master these techniques; or  else purchase another video. The tapes are great to use for drills -  repetitions of kicks and punches - and for a quick 30-minute routine.  However, six months later, I have continued to use them merely as a  supplement to other workouts (or not at all).",953078400,15,1198,4.72463768115942
1053912,5,6305608733,I've had these tapes since march 1999 and had a lot of weight to lose. Did the basic for about 2 weeks and then went on to the advanced where I've been since. Lost around 70 lbs in 5 months doing it 4-6 times a week...have  plateaued since august but only because I lost my focus but haven't gained  anything back. Am back on track with watching what I eat and have added  strength training to my workout also. Have around 50 lbs to go but I feel  great and have never been injured by these workouts even at my heavy  weight.  Billy Blanks delivers the goods if you do exactly what he says.,952905600,54,590,4.131578947368421
1053913,5,6305608733,"As a bear just emerging from hibernation, I found Tae-Bo to be exactly what I needed to get myself energized and in shape for the coming spring and summer.  Billy's motivation got me going and the music kept me there.  While the moves may be a little too much for some, just do what you can and  you'll get there (I did!).  Tae-Bo got my blood moving and also helped me  to tighten up a few muscles that were beginning to get a little slack over  the long winter months.  If you're tired of hype and tired of exercise  vidoes that just make empty promises, you need Tae-Bo. Tae-Bo is a workout  that really delivers and I can't recommend this four-pack highly enough.",952819200,6,667,4.357723577235772
1053914,5,6305608733,"I do not have the 4 pack of Tae Bo, but I do have Tae Bo instructional & Tae Bo Basics. I must admit that Tae Bo is slamming & is an enjoyable work-out.  Now I have never used the words enjoyable &  work-out in the same sentence, so that should tell you how much I like  these tapes! Thank you Billy!",952560000,15,300,3.806451612903226
1053915,4,6305608733,"I enjoy these workouts and it is great that he has given you 4 tapes where you can pick your intensity and also how long you want to do it for (e.g 8 minutes, 1/2 hour or an hour).
But I must admit I would rather still go  to my gym and do boxfit with a class reallife (not allowed to call it Taebo  in New Zealand).  I use Billys tapes for when I basically cannot bother to  leave the house especially in the weekends or if I want to do a workout  before work.
Billys Music: My boxfit class has music that I love, our  instructor plays 80s music which you really can get into.  It is personal  choice I guess, I do not personally find Billys music gets me going at all  (I could not even tell what the music is!).
I also dislike it when he  goes double time and the video does strange speed up thingee.  I am not a  slow person, but I cannot keep up with that sequence.
10/10 for Billys  motivation.  I would love to go to his reallife classes.
Though one thing  that makes me smile, is the fact that he uses the word 'baby' a lot in his  motivation - don't know if my boyfriend appreciates that!",952300800,4,1097,4.0092592592592595
1053916,4,6305608733,"Billy Banks has long been recognised as an expert in the martial arts, so it comes as no surprise that his teaching in these videos is exellent. Starting of with the basic exercises including stretching and warming up  the workouts built up the intensity until you get to the advanced tape.  This format works because it is adaptable for those of low fitness, as well  as the more advanced trainer. These tapes come with a high recommendation  as many people might not have access to a martial arts club. The only  negative aspect of these videos is that they don't concentrate on the  spiritual aspect of the martial arts. However it is likely that having  completed the tapes, the trainer will want to progress to active martial  arts training. The tapes are also good because they are fun to participate  in, thus there is unlikely to be much boredom when the person works out.  The presentation is fair and with Banks one can be assured of a quality  teacher.",951955200,,963,4.6390532544378695
1053917,5,6305608733,"I saw the infomercials and I was impressed. But after I read Amazon's customer reviews, I was unsure. But, figuring that I had nothing to lose, I went ahead and bought the 4-pack of tapes. After watching the instructional  tape with my husband, a martial arts expert, I was impressed. My husband  really liked Billy's adaptation of martial arts and boxing: He thought  Billy's moves were great. I popped in the basic tape yesterday and this  morning, my body is sore. It was one of the best workouts I've had in a  long time. TaeBo is great. I recommend it for anybody wanting a total body  workout. I don't think the basic tape is quite basic; it's more  intermediate but you do what you can and listen to your body. TaeBo is  something I'd like to do for the rest of my life. I think it developes good  hand-eye-coordination, muscle tone and aerobic training.",951609600,37,861,4.538961038961039

Let's  try and get the new tapes with the new music (needed) as fast as possible  on Amazon (they are out I am told).,951091200,20,409,4.0246913580246915

1053980,5,6305608733,I had a baby four months ago and have found it very difficult to go to a gym so I thought I would give Tae-bo a try.  I'm glad I did because I can get a great workout in the privacy of my own home plus it's great  entertainment for my baby.  I have increased my average weekly weight loss  plus I have more energy for my child.  I took about three weeks to work my  way up to the advanced workout.  By doing so I reduced the dreaded soar  muscles after starting a new routine.  Besides the great workout the  motivation from the instructor gives my determination a daily boost.  I  would recommend this video set to friends of any fitness level.,950313600,49,645,4.154471544715447

Every day that's what I looked forward to in school.  It is a good exercise, and it's also very fun.  This has to be the most  enjoyable thing I've done in a long time.

Billy Blanks gives good tips on how not to hurt yourself.  The workout is  very aerobic and fun too.  What I don't like is that when Billy says left  he means HIS left, your right.  So I found I was constantly having to  translate his verbal instructions.  I found the setting to be odd too, like  they made the video on the cheap and couldn't afford to rent a gym.  Compare that to the many Kathy Smith workouts where production quality is  high and Kathy always refers to YOUR right and left.",949881600,9,637,4.313559322033898

I have been working with  the tapes for about two weeks and I'm in love with the workout.  Not only  is it fast, it's fun and really, really is a stress-buster (I work in a  high stress technical environment).  As for injuries, it is like any sport  if not done properly.  I had arthroscopic surgery at the beginning of  December. After working with the tapes, my knee feels 100% better (of  course, I did physical therapy first) and gets a solid workout.  The key is  NOT TO HYPER-EXTEND any limb -- which can happen in most aerobic type  sports if not careful!

So instead of having to buy another copy every few  months (if you do it every day), you buy one copy, so in the end you pay  less.
