2408758,5,B000B8IAH6,"My 4 year old sings these songs all day long, it has really helped her to know her emotions, my 1 year old loves it too.  A definate must if you have an autistic child.",1168387200,3,168,3.8
2408759,5,B000B8IAH6,"How wonderful to have entertainment specifically designed for our kids on the spectrum, so relaxing and soothing at the same time that it is educational: helping kids recognize different emotions in themselves and others. This DVD is very simple, apparently by design, so there is no distracting static.  The teacher says ""welcome to our music class"" and my boys, (7 and 15, both on the spectrum) gladly join in, answering her questions and having a great time!  I hope they make more of these!!",1163116800,9,495,4.880952380952381
2408760,5,B000B8IAH6,"Amazing!  My DD loved this DVD instantly.  The singing is great but the best part is the facial expressions she started immitating instantly.  We've never been able to get her to do more than happy or silly and she would meltdown if anyone tried to teach her sad or crying.  With this she did every facial expression!  She really connected with this DVD from the first second Balloo (cute, cute!) came on the screen.

This is like Baby Bumblebee and Laurie Berkner from Jack's Music Show on Noggin combined into one and made especially for autism spectrum.  GREAT FIND!!!",1140652800,15,571,4.707070707070707
8083500,4,B000B8IAH6,"Please note - most of the reviews below seem to be for a different DVD set -  ""Emotions and Connecting Body Movement"" probably.  The Connections shows are about a starting point (someone figures out how to tell how pure gold is, for example), and then how that connects to something else (commerce takes off) and that connects to another thing (cities develop as a result), etc., and before you know it, the connections lead to something in the modern world like the atom bomb or the Hubble telescope.  It's fascinating, but it has nothing to do with autism.",1520380800,,558,4.673469387755102
8083501,4,B000B8IAH6,3 yo daughter is scared of people- likes watching the first 2 songs on this one- the Hello and Happy songs. The Angry and Sad songs are too overwhelming for her but I think I will persist in showing this to her- I think its worth it because understanding your emotions helps you to verbalize them and deal with them better. Elizabeth has an amazing voice too!,1330214400,,359,4.373134328358209
8083502,4,B000B8IAH6,"For the price that it is this video is a little short. I had to repeat it about 4-5 times to notice my boy really get into it. In general it's pretty simple to follow and sing along and I have to say that singer has a very good voice. My boy has just turned 3 and I've noticed that children on this video seem to be a little older and could follow all the instructions pretty easy. I guess it's work in progress, but hopefully we will get there too. This is pretty good starting program but I have to mention that my kid got into Leap frog ""letters factory"" and story DVD faster.",1314662400,,579,4.043478260869565
8083503,4,B000B8IAH6,"I purchased the Emotions and Connecting Body Movement DVDs by Spectrum Connections for my 4 year old daughter with ASD.  Overall, she liked the videos.  She liked the music and tone of the DVDs.  Both my daughter and I think that Ms. Elizabeth (the teacher) has an engaging personality and nice singing voice.

For learning emotions, though, my daugher and I prefer the Kibbles Rockin Clubhouse DVD to this one for the following reasons:

- Labeling:  The Kibble DVD seems to use more labels (which my hyperlexic daughter likes).

- Transitions:  Kibble uses an activity chart to track where you are on the DVD.  The Spectrum Connections, bu contrast, has only one visual clue (a stuffed alligator) to tell the viewers when the DVD is coming to a close.

- Bonus Features: Kibble offers a sing-along feature to help children with the words to the songs.  Kibble also includes a CD to play in the car.

Please note that, if you have digital cable, PBS Kids Sprout On Demand carries sometimes shows this video (under the heading name ""Bounce"") if you want to preview the format before buying.  If you want to see the Kibbles format, you can check out the Noteabilities website at [...]

8083506,5,B000B8IAH6,My 4 1/2 yr old daughter loves this video...asks to watch it daily.  She is always singing the songs around the house.,1184198400,2,118,4.363636363636363
8083507,5,B000B8IAH6,My son is 2 and really enjoys the songs on this DVD.  He has autism and many DVD's are just too busy so the simplicity is great.,1176249600,5,128,3.740740740740741
8083508,5,B000B8IAH6,If I could give the perfect birthday gift for kids on the spectrum (any child really) it would be this DVD.  It teaches children about different emotions.  It attaches each feeling with face and sings about it!  A must have!,1168992000,6,224,4.55
8083509,5,B000B8IAH6,"I have a 3-year-old autistic son and he loves this video.  It isn't overwhelming and is a great pace for learning.  My 21-month-old daughter also loves it  Both kids interact with the video in a way I have never seen before.  It is a wonderful video and one of the best investments I made for my son's therapy.  My son can identify emotion cards, but he can't apply them to people.  This video helps him apply emotions to real life situations because he can see examples of emtioin in a way that is comfortable for him.  Truly wonderful and worth the money!",1168560000,4,557,4.401960784313726
