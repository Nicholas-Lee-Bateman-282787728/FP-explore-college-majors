8509940,4,B0074JOCYA,"OK, I know it's cheesy, but I really enjoy Celebrity Bowling. It's a blast to see those 60s and 70s movie and television icons that we all enjoyed watching, just being themselves and engaging in a friendly game of bowling. From the clothes, to the prizes offered, to the endorsements for the products that sponsored the show, Celebrity Bowling is a fascinating time capsule from the 1970s.

I loved the first release, which was a 3-disc set that had a batch of episodes. The follow-up release, dedicated to the episodes of the show that featured stars of THE BRADY BUNCH and THE WALTONS was also a blast, but like this latest release,  the latter was only two episodes, totaling about 45 minutes. Though I was able to purchase both of these latter sets at the pre-sale price of $8.99, they don't offer quite the value of the original release.

Still, I hope S'more/Koch continues to release more episodes of the series, preferably in multi-disc sets.  These shows are right up my alley.",1421971200,,986,4.715116279069767
8509941,4,B0074JOCYA,"This is a small but entertaining part of a series that ran during the seventies---there are only two episodes of the series in this DVD, There is a larger set with more episodes available as well. This is a nice little sampler of what the series was like and the styles were like back then.",1367971200,,290,4.290909090909091
8509942,4,B0074JOCYA,"For the price, you can't beat it... but it is set in a different era (70s?).  My son is a bowling major in college and is what I call a serious bowler.  It is a must have for someone that is serious about bowling.",1357257600,2,213,3.8181818181818183
8509943,4,B0074JOCYA,"We caught some of this show on ESPN Classic and found it to be chock full o' retro charm.  This disc is the cheapest avaialble, and well worth it.  Gabe Kaplan almost looks like a bowler.  It's a fun trip down memory lane. The list of prizes they're bowling for will amaze you in how far we've come since then.  Get it, it's cool. :)",1349568000,3,333,4.076923076923077
