6676567,5,B00NQ2ZLDU,"I have TWO of each of their albums, and will buy more to  give away, because 'their story' and 'their music' is amazing!
Losing Joey to cancer last month have been so saddening, and their music became even more beautiful and nostalgic if possible.  Their songs are heart-warming, soulful, melodic, sad, happy, beautiful, done from their hearts in amazing voices.  They can never be replaced because of their connection with each other,  to their music, to their fans, and because they openly shared their lives all along the way, from the beginning of their life together, to Joey's last breath here on earth, and her strong religious belief.  If someone believes in love and God, their life will be enriched and their awareness heightened if they make this music a part of their life, as well.  Their youngest, a baby girl, will most certainly miss her mother, but Joey left such a grand legacy behind her that they baby WILL know her mother through all of her personal and professional videos and songs.  Rory is an amazing father and husband, and has shown his strength and faith through all the months he has kept his family strong.  Goggle ""Joey+Rory Feek"" and listen to one of their songs on YouTube, and you, too, will want all of their albums!!",1459468800,6,1252,4.7110091743119265
6676568,5,B00NQ2ZLDU,"Blessed me abundantly.  Anyone who has followed Joey and Rory's story, this is a MUST!  Missing Joey......May God Bless Rory, Little Indiana, Heidi and Hopie.  Loved this immensely!",1458950400,2,181,5.392857142857143
6676569,5,B00NQ2ZLDU,Love this couple.  Their music and voices are amazing.  So sad she is gone.,1458864000,,75,4.285714285714286

6676571,5,B00NQ2ZLDU,"Love their music, watch them constantly, easy listening.",1458086400,,56,6.125
6676572,5,B00NQ2ZLDU,I have loved this couple since I first saw them on CAN YOU DUET. I love their music and respect their lifestyle. God rest Joey Martin Feek who left us so much to appreciate.,1457308800,,173,4.117647058823529
6676573,5,B00NQ2ZLDU,"I ordered this DVD as I was ordering a few Joey+Rory CDs.  I liked the idea of being able to see the filmed performances of the songs that were included in this collection, and also enjoyed the ability to see the discussion about why these particular songs had been chosen and how they were influences for either Joey or Rory (or both of them combined).  The songs included here are truly classics, ranging through the ages a bit.  The performances are spot on and very true to the original while still giving Joey a chance to make the vocals her own (or Rory a chance to show off his talents on the guitar).
If you had to choose between this DVD or the CD the right answer is both.  If you really, really have to choose then I might recommend the CD a little more just so you can listen to these songs over and over again in places where playing a DVD wouldn't be as convenient.
As I noted in my review of the Joey+Rory CD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hymns-That-Are-Important-To-Us/dp/B01843CZZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hymns That Are Important To Us</a>, I'm glad that Joey and Rory were able to leave behind these performances as evidence of her talents.  She will certainly be missed by her family and fans, but we, the fans, can all enjoy these performances.
For the performances on this DVD fans get to enjoy a visit to Joey+Rory's farm, with host Bill Gaither carrying on a friendly conversation with the couple.  It is obvious that they are friends, and they are very comfortable chatting about these songs.  Joey Feek's performance of ""I'm Not Lisa"" can only be described as haunting.  It is a song that she was definitely born to sing, but then so too were so many other songs (especially the songs included in Hymns That Are Important To Us).  As with ""I'm Not Lisa"", her vocals on another of my favorite songs, ""Let It Be Me"", are also impressive and moving.  While Joey takes the lead for most of the vocals here, fans are treated to Rory's lead vocals on a great rendition of ""King of the Road"".  There are no bad choices here, well, other than being forced to possibly pick a favorite (which would be a nearly impossible choice to make).
Easily 5 stars from both my wife and myself (and a host of others that I know were fans of this nice couple).",1457222400,6,2313,4.672413793103448
6676574,5,B00NQ2ZLDU,The DVD arrived in perfect condition - and I'll have worn it out watching it - It was done before Joey had cancer - and her voice is strong and beautiful - and I don't know WHY Rory doesn't get more praise for his own singing skills - they are a wonderful duo -,1457136000,4,261,3.8518518518518516

I did not want to see that again. I feel like Once Dear Joey Passes into Glory The prices will really climb in price  You should order this CD NOW!
