Some people may not be able to act their way out of a paper bag (I still don't know what that means,) but Maria could certainly act her way out of her spot on the stage in this tape!

Magnificence in so many ways!",1245196800,,391,4.118421052631579
7824068,5,6302314410,"This incontrovertibly important work of musical history provides footage shot during the Paris debut of La Diva Divina, Maria Callas, 19 December, 1958, upon a rainy Friday evening where, inside of the Paris Garnier (later the Th&eacute;tre National de l'Op&eacute;ra de Paris), the resident chorus and orchestra is well-handled and drilled by conductor Georges Sebastian, properly so in consideration for the significance of an event that elicited a critical verdict of brilliance accorded to the finest dramatic soprano of the second half of the twentieth century, about whom an aesthetic industry has grown apace, particularly since her premature death, having a contradictory body of thought available for every considered opinion.  The evening is titled La Grande Nuit de l'Op&eacute;ra, and it is charged with excitement as we view dignitaries arrive, including Ren&eacute; Coty, President of France while, as the camera pans across the interior of the beautiful theatre, other notables from the entertainment realm are recognized, among them Charles Chaplin, Juliette Gr&eacute;co, and Brigitte Bardot (wrapped in a fur!).  This piquant preface to the music requires the VHS taped edition due to its excision from the DVD release of the event and, although the richest portion of the entertainment is yet to come with the appearance of Callas, suspense created from mounting expectancy makes this tape format the correct choice.  The film is made for television in France, with narration in French and, although there are no English subtitles, they would be of little use for this dignified yet dazzling spectacle that will command respect, even from detractors of the esteemed soprano for, while there may be some straining during some pieces, anything less than totally refined musicianship is not to be found here.  Following a rousing orchestral performance of La Marseillaise, Sebastian leads his instrumental charges in a spirited reading of the overture to Verdi's La Forza del Destino, during which the camerawork is exceptional as we watch soloists and also scan the score.  Then the appearance after which all in attendance have been curious: the entrance of Maria Callas, beautifully gowned (crimson, quoth the narrator), coiffed (upswept), and ornamented with diamonds (earrings, necklace), all of which ostensibly contributed to the besotting of Aristotle Onassis, among the audience and soon to crave an introduction.  An immensely enthusiastic welcome to the diva from the attendees is as expected while fulfillment of the promise due to all from her talents immediately makes the acclamation most appropriate.  The initial four arias come from Act I of Bellini's Norma, beginning with Sedizione Voci (with basso Jacques Mars), an ably acted and sung number by both, with chorus.  This is succeeded by a well-known speciality of Callas, Casta Diva, again with chorus, as she displays her superior dramatic expertise, extended applause appropriate a result of her sublime execution.  The final pair of this Norma set provides material that demonstrates her solid command of emotion, certified here by three curtain calls.  From episodes in Act IV of Verdi's Il Trovatore, we are treated to three pieces, including the popular Miserere, again with chorus as well as tenor Albert Lance.  Rossini's exciting Overture to Il Barbiere di Siviglia is perfectly played by the orchestra, after which Callas proves to be more than equal to coloratura requirements of Una Voce Poco Fa from Act I of that opera.  The final segment of the film is given to a complete performance (in costume) of Puccini's Tosca, Act II.  Here, Callas is seen with, among others, baritone Tito Gobbi as Baron Scarpia.  Gobbi is a dramatic match for Callas, their acting being top-notch throughout.  The diva's rendition, as Tosca, of Vissi d'arte, a mainstay throughout her career, temporarily halts the production because of enthusiastic audience reaction.  This film in its entirety is a visceral delight upon a high artistic level, and can be justly recommended for inclusion within the film library of all devotees of Callas and of musical drama.",1238976000,,4140,5.336405529953917
7824069,5,6302314410,"As a devout Callasite, I found it my duty to express my true amazement towards this historical treasure.  To see Callas perform on this casette is an insight into what Callas the actress must have been on stage.  Her voice  is in good form, and she looks like an angel.  The ""Il Trovatore""  excerpts are formidable, and ""Una voce"" is delightful.  This tape  is a must-have for all opera lovers!",960768000,5,394,4.542857142857143
7824070,5,6302314410,"I bought this video without seeing any reviews.  I knew that I wanted to see an actual performance after hearing so many of Maria Callas' wonderful recordings.  I choose this video because it was during the period when  everyone agrees her voice was at it's best.  Although the picture quality  varies, it was broadcast on French T.V. in 1958, the audio quality is much  better than I expected, with the overall effect of feeling that you are at  the Paris Opera House!  The selection of arias are some of the best Callas  ever performed, and her performance is perfection itself.  One can see how  she became the character for each aria.  Finally, the performance of all of  Act II of Tosca is absolutely essential for all opera fans because this is  Maria Callas and Tito Gobbi at their absolute best!",952819200,14,803,4.642857142857143
7824071,5,6302314410,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer from Hawaii. He captured the genius of Callas in one word:""MAGIC"". This video presents La Divina in selections from some of her greatest performances. I recommend it  highly.",939168000,6,215,5.323529411764706
