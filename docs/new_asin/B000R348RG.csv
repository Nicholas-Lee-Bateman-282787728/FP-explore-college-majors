8198641,4,B000R348RG,"I am going to go against the grain and rate this video well.  I rated 4 stars for content not for the video quality.  Hilary Thacker is old school style of dancing and teaching.  When I watch her dance, her style is what I envision when I think of belly dancing. Her studio is in Edinburgh, Scotland.  If you happen to come across the reviews for the Hilary Thacker dvds on the Amazon UK website you will find the reviews are more favorable to the European audience opposed to the American reviews.  From what I understand, it was the American audience that demands the choreography dvds and play by play instruction, so if that is what you are accustomed to, then this may not be the video for you.

Personally, I love this video.  It reminds me of my first teacher who was also an old school belly dancer in the 1970's in Los Angeles, CA.  She taught much the same way, ""I dance and you follow"".  That is how it has been done from teacher to dancer for generations.

You can read the other reviews for the video breakdown, but here is what I like about the dvd.

Hilary Thacker begins with a demonstration dance to baladi music.  Not an area with much focus in the DIY home instructional field. I love the baladi dance, and it is a demonstration that you can practice following along too.  The video is divided into a categories, focusing on hip drops, Egyptian Walk and a few others.  Hilary does dance in a basement, but who cares, do you know how much it costs to make a video? She will take one move, something we have all learned in basic belly dance.  She will dance that one move to baladi music in the background and with a full length mirror to see front and back views.  However, she will make slight variations to that one move, directional or arms.  After a few minutes, the scene changes and she will bring you to her classroom with students.  These are students, not professional dancers.  Some are not in sync, some ladies are better than others, but I find it refreshing to watch them in the background.  Partly because it reminds me of how my beginning class was and you can watch someone and think, ""Yeah, I definitely do not want to look like that"" and then you have something else to work on.  After several minutes practicing with the class, Hilary will take you to the next move to work on.

So why is this good?  My instructor always told us you can dance with just two moves and no one ever believed her.  We never really learned how, so the Advanced dvd was like the ""ah-ha moment"" for me after all of these years.  I like that Hilary spends five minutes on one move and shows the different variations.  I find this to be a helpful stepping stone learning how to improv, especially if you want to dance to baladi.

I also purchased the Advanced Video which is also awesome.  When I watch Hilary dance in the Advanced video I can see the moves in her dance that were focused on in the Intermediate dvd.  Plus there are live musicians and the video has more focus on the musicality with the musicians.

I recommend this video to dancers who are tired of another choreography dvd, which I am, and any dancer regardless of level if you are interested in traditional baladi belly dance. Ranya Renee is the only other dancer who addresses this specific topic of belly dance as far as I know.  We have very few dancers in my community that dance old-school, but when they do dance the crowd goes wild.  Baladi is more relaxed in stance and posture, so to some it may look sloppy.  Personally, I like it.  I give the video a thumbs up and I recommend the Intermediate Video too.
I paid about $13 for the video, super cheap for the content and material provided in the video.  I consider this a good buy.",1377648000,,3722,4.376093294460642
8198642,1,B000R348RG,"This is not a professional video and a very disappointing amateur instruction video. The bellydancer wears an outfit that covers her legs, making it difficult for beginners to see the correct posture and whether or not the knees are bent or straight. In addition to this, the sound quality is poor and the instructor speaks softly and without animation to encourage beginners. A better alternative would to browse lessons posted on youtube, than to pay for a video that really isn't worth it.",1349740800,,492,4.9397590361445785
8198643,2,B000R348RG,"I watched this DVD on Netflix as I often do before deciding to purchase a DVD.  The recording is a very poor quality.  The costumes and dance are very unsophisticated.  Thacker clearly has been dancing for a while; her movements are smooth, but she is not a good teacher.  She demonstrates moves quickly, once or twice, before going into more complicated motions or using the steps in a dance sequence.  It does not give the viewer time to catch on.  Her costumes, especially the black one, are very Western and revealing, but ironically prevent a learner from getting a full idea of how she is manipulating her body.  Her veil work is very limited, almost laughable.  The veil work shows less creativity and movement variation than I got in my first bellydance class.

I watched many DVDs on Netflix and from the library before deciding to take bellydance from a local instructor.  I am getting much more complete instruction at my speed accompanied by appropraite insights to help me understand bellydance culturally.  Take from an instructor if you can, even for a short time.  I have not come across a DVD that I like as an alternative.  When I do I will add it to this review.

If you are interested in bellydance I recommend it, but rent DVDs before you buy.  Make sure they match your learning style and be aware that the culture represented in the DVD may not be accurate.",1317945600,,1380,4.621399176954733
8198644,1,B000R348RG,"I usually list all the positives first, but I can't think of anything positive to say about this video except that you can view it as a watch it now on Netflix. If you don't believe me, go see it yourself. The video quality is very poor. Looks like it was filmed in someone's dark basement with a cheap camera and a boom box. I could forgive that a little if the content was good. It's not. The dancer has poor technique, poor posture, a weird face, bad arms and hands, and cheep costumes. Her performance pieces looked like a student dancing. This person should not be teaching.",1295308800,4,579,4.37037037037037
8198645,1,B000R348RG,"this was bad.

i expected a much more professional product from someone who has a set of 3 videos.
i expect a professional product, precise movements, detailed instruction, and clean performances from every instructional video i buy. After all, you are a professional, right? i rate this a D.

the sound isn't to great,the setting is in a basement, and everyone looks pretty shabby. you can tell her backup dancers are some of her students; that's not a bad thing, but they look like they are wearing whatever they threw on to go to class that day, and Hilary looks grungy the whole time and her hair is a mess. it is also very short for the price- 30 minutes. You can also tell that this is from the 90's- just get something newer and better from World dance New York for the same price.

besides the production values, this is pretty bad in terms of  instructional help the viewer is given. there is no breakdown of moves, and things are done only once or twice at a slower speed. she gives you help sometimes with weight changes, but that's not much help when you only did that move 3 times with one hip and then moved on. it would take a VERY dedicated student to get each move picked out, watch it over and over, and then practice it on their own enough to master it.

Her posture is bad- she looks short and squatty the whole time. You can keep your knees soft without looking like a toddler with a full diaper. Also, i think she has a very wide stance that looked a little iffy to me- although that might be part of her style, i don't know. my sister and i finally figured out that she looks weird as she dances because she has flat and weirdly stiff flipper-feet, so maybe her wide stance would be fine on someone else.

she also has limp, but stiff, arms. maybe this is another stylistic thing, but they just sort of flopped around. her hands are held in, to me, an unnatural way- they are turned forward in that classic ""jazz hands"" position. just watch. after you notice them, you won't be able to keep your eyes off of the horror of her little stiff hands permenently waving at you. her little hand-flippers swim around here and there, but they are pretty frozen. its mesmerizing after a while. anyway...

in the begining of each section hilary is by herself in front of a mirror (where you can se a 3/4 shot of her back if you look hard). then we move to a hilary in front of a class doing the moves. there are 5 sections in this video-

the first section is labeled ""Hits"". she does a couple of this, a couple of that, and she just kind of dances along and the voice over talks about it. this lasts for about 5 minutes, then we move to the classroom to do the same set of moves again with her students. (sometimes she actually breaks things down more in this second portion than she did in front of the mirror, so i'm not sure which is supposed to demonstration and which is practice.) it is easy to get distracted in this and all of the class settings because the students behind her are either off time with her, or each other, or both. this classroom portion lasts about 3 minutes.

Then its ""Hip Drops"". the mirror section of demonstration is about 3 min, then class time of about 2 minutes. by this time you notice that no move is done more than a few times, and almost nothing is done on both sides. there are a lot of people out there with tired rewind fingers.

The next section is entitled ""The Egyptian Walk"" and lasts a little over 3 minutes for both sections combined. there is almost no explanation of this set of moves, and the students are just as lost as you are. it's hard to watch.

Next is ""Adding Steps"", with about 4 minutes of mirror time and just under 2 minutes of class time. this is mostly how to turn the moves in a circle or doing step-together-step with a particular move, rather than more moves or layering as you might have thought.

Now we get to the last section - ""The Stick"". there is about 3 minutes of instruction in this section where she covers a lot- none if it explained. how to hold the cane, moving the cane around while doing camels, walking camels, shoulder hits and circles, etc. (she is in full costume for this section and there is a nice set. you wonder why the rest of it was filmed in her basement rec room.) then a 3 minute cane dance performance -disguised as a instructional part of this video with a voice over. she likes doing this and does a good job at it- or maybe its just so much better than what you've seen so far that you think it's better than it is. i think this is the only section where she has stage presence and is engaged with her audience, and this is the only section where she is a dancer.

so-
if you have been taking dance since you were a small child and can just ""watch and learn"" you might be fine with this and be able to pick out moves you like, but to anyone else who needs moves explained to you- pass this one up.
this should also be a ""Pass"" for people who like lots of repetition for learning muscle memory. you will have to do that on your own with this video.
this should also be a ""pass"" for those who like a very flamboyant style of bellydance. i'm not sure what THIS style is, but there are no sweeping arms and swishy skirts and dramatic pauses for you.",1231459200,3,5259,4.25751503006012
8198646,1,B000R348RG,"I did not feel this was a video for an Intermediate dancer. Second level beginners may find it useful, but not someone with as little as 6 months of dance classes.",1210377600,,163,4.290322580645161
8198647,1,B000R348RG,This is a very beginner DVD.  I would not recommend it.  The cane dance was the only good part about it.,1203984000,3,104,3.9047619047619047
8198648,2,B000R348RG,"I found this to be more of a commentary on a dance class.  I did enjoy the cane dance that Hillary performed, along with a commentary telling you which steps she is doing.  Also some interesting bonus material, so if you do get this, watch the bonus material, too.  Good dancer, not so great dvd.",1203033600,2,296,4.345454545454546
8198649,3,B000R348RG,"Hilary Thacker is from the UK & has of course, a UK accent. This dvd was produced in a tent at a restaurant w/tapestries against the wall & floor & simple urns on either side. Hilary is dressed in a jet black beaded top & skirt & which is a bad choice, you cannot see her knees. She calls shimmies wobbles mostly. The production is low, I agree I have to put the volume up to hear her over the music & still have to strain to make her out. The music is always playing & it is wonderful Middle Eastern choices. This helps make the dvd more fun, at one oint, you can hardly hear it & I got bored REAL fast. Each section show a nice b&w photo of a belly dancer. There are no chapter choices. Extras are trailers of her performances (some are very fluid, some stiff), text origions of belly dancing, vintage belly dancing photos,
Hilary's style of teaching is to the point, she does it slow a few times & builds it up & then you practice with her a good amount of time, about the same as any other dance fitness workout dvd. I commend her on doing that, although her delivery & choice of words are lacking & extreme newbies might get lost with her. Those, like me, who think going 1/2 speed is the most important, will be able to follow pretty easily. The lack of warnings about poor muscle use, etc. like the Neena & Veena - bellytwins, Suhaila, Neon, Jillina, Jenna, etc. do is wrong.
Moves she goes over: hip circle, horizontal figure 8s, hip drops, Egyptian walk, hip bumps, hip & shoulder shimmies, hip twist, fluid hands/arms, snake arms, hands & camel walk. The last 10 min is a lot of veil work. Dancing around it, behind the head, in front, butterfly arms, everything most other teach & then some.
I'd say having the music playing throughout was a huge help, her patience & doing everything many times is great, but the sound was off, her teaching could be better.

Her website is hilarysbazaar com says: Her intermediate has a number of exciting variations of the beautiful Baladi folk style and how to dance with a stick & includes class scenes. The advanced has Hilary explores four rhythms, first with as a drum solo & then set to music & there is also some beginners finger cymbal instruction.",1200182400,10,2203,4.373170731707317
