8364398,5,B002CT5JTE,"PLOT: 1937 hard to find follow up to the Leslie Howard version~ Barry K. Barnes does AN EXCELLENT JOB as the Scarlet Pimpernel Returns~ They kidnap his lovely wife (Sophie Stewart) and he follows her to France and arranges her escape but can HE escape?

this is very hard to find but here it is~ very over looked follow up movie to the earlier Leslie Howard Version. made in 1937 with Barry K. Barnes who looks a little like Howard I am sure the CASTING people did not it on ""purpose""~ LOL~ in this version Percy and Margarite are safe in jolly old England when a clever French Spy and her brother (a very young James Mason) kidnap Margerite (Sophie Stewart) to get the Pimpernel to follow them back to France so they can capture HIM~ Sophie Stewart is very lovely and sweet as Margarite who trusts a young French girl and her bother (James Mason) and ends up in France their Prisoner~ a great kidnapping scene and Percy is soon hot on the trail which leads him to France~ Barry K. Barnes does a fantastic job in several disguises my favorite is the DEAF soldier who has to ""overhear"" some hot news where Margarite is being held. James Mason is very good as the DUPE who helps get Margarite kidnapped. this is nearly as good as the first~ very good plot based very accurately on the Barnoness Orczy novels. This one has very good disguises and acting and scene stealer here is Barnes who has us glued to all of his many ""characters"" I GIVE IT A SOLID 10 OUT OF 10 FOR WONDERFUL PLOT, ACTING CASTING AND COSTUMES~ I GIVE BARRY BARNES A 20 for someone we like nearly as much as Leslie Howard but who never got the credit~ AT LAST A HARD TO FIND GEM IS RELEASED ON DVD~ WE SEEK HIM HERE WE SEEK HIM THERE , AT ""LAST"" WE HAVE HIM ON DVD EVERYWHERE~ OOPS PARDON MY BAD PUN~ ENJOY THIS FUN FOLLOW UP DVD GEM~",1256688000,2,1802,4.269005847953216
