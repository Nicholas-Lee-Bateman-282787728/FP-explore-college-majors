8123084,5,B000FII306,"In our home, Clifford is the sun, moon, and stars. Clifford is our dearest, closest, most bestest friend in the whole world. My daughter is two. She's obsessed with the show. We (her parents) are ok with this because Clifford is actually watchable, as opposed to some other kid shows which are just insanely stupid. Clifford has good morals and some nice little characters, some not so nice characters who always learn their lesson in the end, some funny moments. This particular DVD comes with a bonus growth chart, so that's nice. We have a lot of Clifford, this one seems to be her favorite right now.",1231459200,6,604,4.654205607476635
8123085,4,B000FII306,"Now that John Ritter has passed (RIP) and no new episodes are being made, this series continues its trot to DVD. Lionsgate is handling the releases now, under the ""Scholastic Clifford the Big Red Dog"" banner.

""Growing Up With Clifford"" contains the usual eight ""Clifford"" stories, with the them of learning about growing and handling responsibilities. The stories are ""Blanket Blues,"" ""Food for Thought,"" ""When I Grow Up,"" ""Fishing Lessons,"" ""Dog for a Day,"" ""Nothing to Fur but Fur Itself,"" ""Another Fine Mess"" and ""Vaz Goes Down the Tubes.""

There are a couple of halfway decent special features. You get three ""Speckle"" stories and a feature that shows how to draw some of the characters, such as Clifford, Emily Elizabeth, T-Bone and Cleo.",1164758400,20,744,5.040650406504065
