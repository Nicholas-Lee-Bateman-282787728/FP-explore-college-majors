7749389,5,B01F8505J2,"Fantastic movie for kids and adults! Great animation and touching story. The import is the only way to own this movie in the US as of now. Netflix has the distributing rights in the US and there's no telling when or if they will ever release it. As some have stated the Digital Copy is for Canada owners only. Personally I feel the negative reveiws by some isn't warranted here. I think if you read the info and do a quick google search you would be aware that any import will not come with a digital copy that works in the US.  It's that simple. So if the Digital Copy is that important to you then I'd recommend not buying any imports, including this one.",1488758400,3,657,4.256
7749390,1,B01F8505J2,The digital copy is only valid in Canada.  This should be explicitly stated in the title/description.,1488585600,7,101,5.3125
7749391,5,B01F8505J2,"Saw this on Netflix and now it's one of my favorite animations EVER. Beautiful story, very well made and a very loving story. Lots of hidden meanings to pick up on through its magical journey. I'm adding it to my bluray collection. Please watch.",1487462400,,245,4.590909090909091
7749392,2,B01F8505J2,"I echo a previous reviewer. We bought this copy because it's the combo DVD bluray and digital copy, but the digital copy is only valid for the Canadian App Store. It's not clearly labeled. Bluray and DVD work fine but I feel that I was misled on this purchase.",1484956800,9,260,4.326530612244898
7749393,1,B01F8505J2,"This is a fantastic movie, but I went to go and get the digital copy and it's only available in Canada. This should be in the description by the seller as I specifically bought this blu-ray because it included the digital copy. I can't in good faith give it a 5 star rating since it is clearly misrepresented.",1484784000,15,309,4.344827586206897
7749394,4,B01F8505J2,"I love the movie.  BUT, the digital copy advertised is ONLY available in Canada.  So, if you purchase the Blu-ray + with the hopes of getting a digital copy, as I did, then you will be disappointed.  This doesn't take away from the movie itself, which is delightfully deep and compelling.  It does, however, mean you're paying for something you aren't getting.",1484697600,9,360,4.758064516129032

7749398,2,B01F8505J2,"The movie is excellent but buyer beware. As others have already noted, the digital copy is only valid in the Canadian iTunes store. If you don't care about the digital copy, enjoy the movie. If you do, you're out of luck unless you live in Canada.",1521072000,,247,4.391304347826087

8760450,5,B01F8505J2,A very sweet movie on so many levels! We just left the animation and the message and the feeling we got after watching this show! Thank you so much for producing something so impactful for myself and our children! The message is to remember what's most important in life to treasure childhood and each other and not get so stuck on our to-do list or on being a grown up :-) it also reminds us to Remember The Little Prince,1532390400,,422,4.2875
8760451,4,B01F8505J2,"This can easily be watched over and over.
USA beware. If you are a US buyer let it be known that you CANNOT use the digital code. The customer service for said digital codes won't answer you back if you try to plead with them. This is HARDCOPY ONLY for USA don't be fooled.",1532390400,,273,4.074074074074074

8760455,3,B01F8505J2,"If only one lived in Canada....  This version of the DVD should not be sold without clearly stating in the title that the version is for CANADA.  The DVD and Blu-ray play fine, but the Digital Copy is ONLY available to people who have a Canadian iTunes account.  If you purchase this for the Blu-ray and do not use the Digital Copy, it may be worth the extra price, but you will be getting two copies (DVD & Blu-ray), NOT the three advertised.",1522886400,,443,4.313253012048193
