2455152,3,B000CBEKVW,"I've given Legacy a neutral rating because, though it's a beautiful film created by experts in the field, it still should be viewed as what it is - strictly a piece of propaganda promoting the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ( Mormon Church ) and extolling their pioneers and founder.  Though you'd never know, since all traces of anything like credits have been excised from this DVD, it was directed by Academy Award-winner Kieth Merrill ( for his IMAX production about the Grand Canyon ) and filmed on location, largely at the Mormon settlement at Nauvoo, Ill., in 1990.  Originally shot in 70mm for showing in the then-new visitor center on Salt Lake City's Temple Square, Legacy recounts the events impelling the Mormon Trek and the tribulations of a fictious family, as seen through the eyes of the daughter, creditably played by TV veteran Kathleen Beller.

I was pleasantly surprised at the care and details of this brief ( just under one hour, as befits its primary purpose as an orientation film ) look at what passes for the earliest days of the Mormon movement.  Sets, costumes, cinematography, and music ( also uncredited, but presumably the Mormon Tabernacle Choir ) are all first-rate, and the cast and acting adequate.  Especially impressive in the widescreen ""letterbox"" format are shots of wagons, teams, and settlers plodding westward beneath glorious sunsets, all attesting to director Merrill's previous experience in the medium with such IMAX productions as Grand Canyon and Alamo - The Price of Freedom.  Ms. Beller is always believable as a 19th-century pioneer woman, not to mention properly wearing ( and nicely filling out! ) appropriate clothing of the 1840's period when this tale takes place.

Unfortunately, not as much can be said about the hackneyed, pedestrian script: totally lacking is any motivation for any of the action and plot developments, such as exist. The sole ""historical"" character, other than the nemisis governor of Missouri, is Mormon founder and self-styled ""Prophet"" Joseph Smith, seen briefly as a Christ-like figure usually ludicrously bathed in a ray of light against a dark background.  ( No subliminal symbolism here! )  No attempt is made to explain why the world seems set against them or why the governor outlaws them.  Only a brief allusion is made ( by an Anglican priest ) to the fact of them belonging to a new sect in a changing world or what that may mean.  NO mention whatsoever is made of the ""P"" word ( poligamy ) and no plural families are shown, though there is a brief, conventional ""romantic"" love triangle.  In fact, there is absolutely no difference at all shown between Mormon society and that of any of their neighbors, causing the casual viewer to wonder exactly what all the fuss was about!

Legacy begins to wind down with the ""martyrdom"" of the Prophet ( though this is neither shown nor explained ), the stubborn completion of the Temple in Nauvoo, and the Mormons setting out yet again for Zion, wherever that will finally be.  The replacement Prophet, Brigham Young, is never depicted ( much like Mohammed is treated in Muslim productions ) but is said to have ""gone ahead"" with the lead party.  Zion is never reached, except in the prologue and ending, so the Mountain Meadows Massacre also never happens, nor does the retaliatory United States military expedition against the Mormons, at the time the largest mounted to date.  This is unsurprisingly a VERY selective and whitewashed look at what was in fact a seminal event in Western and United States history.",1339113600,6,3559,4.926421404682274
2455153,5,B000CBEKVW,"I saw this video in Utah at the Joseph Smith memorial building, and it was a very emotionally moving production.  I bought a copy for each of my Children and their families when it was released on video.",1240012800,9,203,4.342105263157895
8096646,5,B000CBEKVW,"Historically based Legacy, is a film with faithful themes and lovely music and scenery. This fictional family tale connects real events that catalyzed a trek west for thousands in the mid-1800s. Reflects religious experiences of early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons).",1517443200,,304,5.48936170212766

8096655,5,B000CBEKVW,"When I first saw this movie at the Joseph Smith Memorial building theater, my mouth dropped open several times in sheer awe of this production.  The camera angles, lighting, and framing rival anything in Hollywood.  I would rate it among the top movies I have seen in my life.  I would put it up there with Random Harvest, and Only Angels Have Wings, for story development and the technical aspects of film-making.

To be appreciated, this film should be viewed on a large size TV, as the panoramas are breath-taking.

The story gives a seamless account of early Mormon (LDS) history from the prism of history as viewed from the Mormon lens of perspective. It uses an effective flashback technique to frame the story.

The Actors and Actresses, and the other production crew, including the Director, are top flight.

If you like a heart-warming, clean family film, that promotes Faith in The Lord Jesus The Christ, then this is a a masterpiece for you.

When I made my Christian Indie movie, ""Sisters Go Ye trailer 2"" on Youtube, I tried to reach these heights; but they had a bigger budget!

Praise Ye The Lord,
