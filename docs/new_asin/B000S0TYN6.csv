directed by Arthur Roberson
approximately 1 hour 28 minutes

This movie is a little different from a typical black exploitation movie.  It starts out by showing a family where the parents have a strained relationship with their prostitute daughter.  This woman (called ""the painted woman"") ends up having a kid after being impregnated by one of her clients.  She leaves the lilly white boy with his grandparents, a kind old lady and a stern minister.  Grandma cares for the boy and he has a close relationship with her.  Grandpa is more distant, believing that little good can come from a boy who came into the world in such negative circumstances.  When the boy grows older, he dreams of having a family of his own with his girlfriend, but eventually he is left thinking that he cannot trust anybody in the world.  This starts him on a quest to reunite with his biological mother.

The movie is obviously low budget, but I enjoyed it for the most part.  Almost none of the characters have actual names, but are referred to as ""boy"", ""Grandma"" etc.  Basically the point of the movie is to show how miserable the main character's life can get.  I was a little surprised that the racial elements were not played up more, especially since the actor playing the son is would be a very light skinned addition to the family.  The editing is very choppy and sometimes confusing.  My favorite part of the movie is the funeral sequence, which is shot in sepiatone. The scene is meant to show the existential tension between the family members.

Most of the people involved in this movie (including the director) never did anything else related to films.  Jeff Burton, the man who plays Grandpa had been in several movies previously, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coffy/dp/B000053VB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coffy</a>.  Kathryn Jackson, the woman who plays Grandma did go on to do some TV shows such as  Sanford and Son.  She was also in the western movie '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joshua/dp/B002DMJVVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joshua</a>' which starred Fred Williamson.

The woman who plays the painted woman is a lady named Sandra Alexandra.  She did not do much else as an actress, but she released several albums of soul music.  She had two studio album on UNI records as well as a live record.  Apparently she still performs today under the name Cissandra Durkin.

This is the same movie as '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Hooker/dp/B000YQRAIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Hooker</a>'.",1266451200,,2660,5.479115479115479
