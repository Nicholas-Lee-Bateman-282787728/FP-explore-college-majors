5527339,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been following Zuzka for years and her workouts are incredible, accessible from everywhere AND don't require equipment. The fact that these DVDs come with a calendar to follow changes everything. It will hold me accountable and keep me on track. I LOVE ZUZKA LIGHT!!!",1357603200,4,272,5.066666666666666
5527340,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been waiting for this DVD from Zuzka. I've been following her workout since 2010 and it's really worked!!! It's mostly short and no need of expensive equipment but very effective. If you haven't try to do any of her workout, you MUST try it. She is has no hype but a humble type trainer and yet she's very inspiring. She's a real person just like us. After buying a lot  of workout videos, I finally found the best and the one I'll keep forever. Thanks, Zuzka!!!! :)",1357603200,7,471,4.3522727272727275
5527341,5,B00AY5JB92,"I know Zuzana's workouts for more then 4 years now, and she is simply amazing!
Her workouts are realy short, but intense = you can see results FASTER then ever!

This DVD pack is 90 days program, which is really great (price is very good).

Don't worry about your fitness level - she has modification for beginers!!",1357603200,48,315,4.508771929824562
5527342,4,B00AY5JB92,"I purchased this when it originally came out for $15.00.  It was well worth it- if you use it.  I was a little thrown by the fact that there isn't any music, but I purchased it to get fit, not to dance, so I just play my Ipod.  If you are committed and keep doing it consistently, you will see results.  They are simple exercises, but very intense, which I like.  The motivation is that you may feel horrible for the first two weeks, and struggle a lot, but you can go at your own pace, and as you see your ability to keep up with Zuzka increase you are more motivated.  As with any workout program, it is a mindset and a choice to stay committed beyond how you feel.  I have joined the Zuzka light gym- which is similar to Daily burn with a weekly workout schedule and a lot of other workout options for your specific needs and fitness level.  At $9.99 a month, it is cheaper than purchasing any of her videos from Amazon. A whole year (billed monthly) is only $120.  You get a lot more for a lot less. I recommend Zuka light (just add your own music)- if you can find the DVD's at a reasonable price... if not, try her website.",1458086400,2,1129,4.1187214611872145
5527343,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been following Zuzka on YouTube for years, was so excited when she released this DVD set. Definitely amazing, and hard(!!) workouts!",1453852800,,137,5.2727272727272725
5527344,5,B00AY5JB92,AWESOME HIIT workouts. Zuzka rocks!,1453680000,,35,6.2
5527345,3,B00AY5JB92,"I'm sure this is an effective workout, however, I found it very demanding without a progressive build up and was unable to stick with it. The exercises are not always well explained and I found it less engaging than exercise DVDs that showcase a workout group of varying levels. The studio, lighting and camera work all seem a bit low budget.",1452384000,,342,4.622950819672131
5527346,5,B00AY5JB92,"These workouts are GREAT.  I am mom to a toddler and two older kids, and I need a workout where I can get in, get it done, and move on with my day.  ZCUT delivers with results.  I feel healthier within 3 days of starting the workouts.  I do HATE the one where you have to do burpees and high knees 60 times.  But... I guess it is good for me.  :-P  My body is in my thirties now, and HIIT workouts seem to be the only thing it responds to.  However, I have had to modify after a few days of HIIT workouts, because my wrists can't take all the push ups and weight on them, and my back gets sore, too.  I can't tell yet if this is because I am older, or just more out of shape now than in the past.  So, I would not recommend these videos for anyone who is not already exercising or a little in shape.  I personally stopped using them to get a little more strength in my core first, so I don't injure myself.  But, I plan on coming back to them as soon as I feel ready.  On a side note, my sons call this the ""Lady with the ripped shirt workout.""  My husband calls it the ""Boob show.""  Zuzka's attire leaves very little to the imagination....",1451088000,,1140,3.93859649122807
5527347,5,B00AY5JB92,"Uh, this workout series is AWESOME...if I could just finish it.  She plays no games and you will be worked out.  I plan on restarting her workouts this month to jump start my NYE resolution to drop the weight.  I think this can be a great addition to your current workout plan OR stand alone by itself.  You won't be disappointed but you will be sore.  Sorry...lol",1449446400,,364,4.373134328358209

5527351,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been using these workouts for several months and have lost 10lbs.  I love that they quick, about 15min each.  So I can get my workout in quickly before my kids wake up.  And there's a new workout each day, to keep you interested.  I hope she releases new workouts soon.",1448236800,,274,4.313725490196078

5527353,3,B00AY5JB92,This series was okay but honesty I didn't even finish the first week. Halfway through her workouts I felt like I was going to pass out on my floor or throw up. I know that's the point but there was also no music or anything upbeat about her attitude so it felt more like a chore then something fun so I discontinued use. I recommend bligolates on YouTube. Way more fun and I'll look forward to my workouts which helps keep me motivated and on track,1446595200,,448,4.22093023255814
5527354,5,B00AY5JB92,I used to watch Zuzka online before she started making DVDs. Still love all of her stuff. It is very easy to follow and if you stick to the weekly plan you will see results....given a good diet helps too. At first it is difficult but after 3-4 weeks you can really see a change if you stick to the routine and push yourself. Short and sweet workouts!,1446422400,,350,4.161764705882353

5527359,5,B00AY5JB92,"Solid workouts. I like these because they don't require much, if any, equipment but work all the basic muscle groups really hard and in a short amount of time. Zuzka is easy to listen to and gives good cueing and instructions. I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and these are tough but are very effective. I don't use these as stand alone but part of a rotation. With insanity, Bob harper and others to mix it up. I don't know if I would use them as the only workout routine because they do lack some of the more aerobic conditioning but they are great intense workouts.",1441152000,,578,4.411214953271028

5527362,5,B00AY5JB92,Short workouts that pack a powerful punch. Not easy at all. She's not annoying like a lot of other fitness instructors. Also cool that she does all the workouts herself.,1439510400,,169,4.666666666666667
5527363,5,B00AY5JB92,"Wow, what a powerful workout in such a short amount of time (but not necessarily good for beginners) Zuzka is cool and not annoying at all. Really like how she actually does all the exercises herself.",1439510400,,200,4.583333333333333
5527364,5,B00AY5JB92,"These are insane workouts for only 10-15 minutes long. You will feel it and they do work. This military style woman knows how to make a muscle burn in a short amount of time. They're all different and extremely fun. And having zuzka to do it with you is great. And it's not just for girls, my athlete brother had trouble with some of these workouts!",1436140800,,349,4.303030303030303

5527378,5,B00AY5JB92,"arrived quickly.  Love her workouts but they don't have any extra special production stuff like music.  She's just working out.  Still, GREAT workouts and it's always nice to have someone to follow along with. :)",1426723200,,212,5.0

5527381,5,B00AY5JB92,"Love these. You have to realize you may not be able to keep up with her so you will have to be creative in modifying movements or pausing the dvd.  I like that she shows the hardest version because it gives me something to work towards  The menu on each disc looks like this:

Warm up
workout 1
Workout 2
workout 3
Workout 4
Cool down
Ab workout

I wish the warm up and cooldown played automatically but I'm sure there are people that would like to do a warm up and 2 workouts before the cooldown so it's very customizable.

No fluff, no extra chit chat, just work. I like that although it wouldn't be an everyday workout, one I grab for a change or when I need a good workout in little time.",1420329600,2,326,4.09375

5527393,5,B00AY5JB92,"These workouts are hard, but they are worth it!  I have seen her on BodyRock Tv/Youtube, and I have always like them.  Glad they are out on DVD!!  I have a long ways to go, and I can't get through every single rep, and I am not as fast as she is, but I feel stronger after each workout.  I plan on getting her other series too!  Of all the exercises out there, this is by far my favorite.  Don't need a group of people to exercise with, don't need loud music, don't need fancy equipment, don't need to workout for hours on end, just pop it in and get it done!  It's amazing really, I've done Insanity workouts that are 45mins long (and no, I am not knocking Insanity, because I like that too) but the day after, I didn't really feel any different.  With this workout, 20mins or less, I feel it the next day.  IT WORKS!  I like her attitude, she's very motivating!",1418688000,2,863,4.144578313253012

If you are a beginner do be careful as you can easily hurt yourself if you are not use to these kind of workouts. If you are new do what you can at a comfortable pace and don't worry about doing as many as Zuzka can do.

5527404,5,B00AY5JB92,"This is a great workout.  Zuzka chooses dynamic and challenging moves that engage the whole body.  You will work on strength while keeping your heart rate up to maximize calorie burn. Zuzka doesn't waste time explaining the moves, which is one of my biggest pet peeves of many other strength workouts.  (If needed, you can preview them with the breakdown).  There are plenty of burpees and various forms of squats and lunges.  These workouts have a major focus on legs.
I have completed Insanity and Insanity Asylum 1&2; I have ran several marathons; and I have tried pretty much every workout that is promised to pack a punch.  This one does not disappoint.",1412208000,4,658,4.778761061946903

5527410,4,B00AY5JB92,"Twelve workout plus three bonus workouts.  These are incredibly hard workouts for only being 20 minutes long.  Each disk has the same warm up and cool down.  The warm up, exercise, and stretching cool down is about 40 min all together and a great workout.  I consider myself moderate to advanced and these kick my butt.  The combination moves are very difficult compared to other workout videos I have tried (T25, Insanity, Brazil Butt Lift, Jillian Michaels Shred) but I am able to modify.  This is a no frills video, little music, she does the workout with you so you hear her gasping for breath and counting reps.  I am incredibly sore after each workout and but two days between videos.  Excellent for butt, thighs, and core.  I recommend this video to anyone bored with their workout or cannot seem to get away from cardio.  The workouts use weights with full body moves which give you an excellent cardio at the same time.
Negatives: Same warm up and cool down on each disk, would be nice to change things up.  Music is very low.",1410393600,,1035,4.570652173913044

I am probably an intermediate to advanced exerciser and after I completed the first workout I was sore the next day (which I did not expect). I have done many of Jillian Michaels' videos and I usually workout 6 days a week. Previously, I had never heard of Zuzka. I am familiar with BodyRock TV, but I was not a fan of those videos, since the workouts were usually shot in risque angles. Fear not, these videos are shot in traditional workout video style and the only risque thing about them is Zuzka's outfit (which is pictured on the DVD cover and is no different than what any other fitness guru wears). After browsing for a new Jillian Michaels or Amy Dixon video, I stumbled upon Zuzka. I thought that the reviews justified purchasing and for $15.95 you couldn't go wrong! And you CAN'T go wrong with these videos. If you only have 12-15 minutes a day and want an intense HIIT workout, these are for you!

As another reviewer posted, the 3 DVDS in the set have a warm up and cool down for you to complete before and after each workout. The warm-up is about 7 minutes and the cool down is about 8 minutes.

Each DVD has 4 workouts and there is a bonus workout for a total of 13 workouts. There is an option to have Zuzka breakdown each workout or you can skip the breakdown and head straight to the workout. The breakdowns are very helpful. Zuzka describes every exercise in detail and shows the proper form. She also shows alternate ways to complete the exercises if you are struggling and she is very encouraging.

Zuzka also includes a 30 day calendar which shows which workouts should be completed on each day and you can download the next 30 day calendars on her website for free.

I have completed all of these workouts several times and in my opinion, the workouts do not necessarily increase in intensity. Sometimes, I struggle through workout 1 more than workout 12. So, you can jump around from workout to workout if you feel that one is harder for you to complete on a certain day. The only equipment you need is a set of dumbbells (if you choose) and a chair, which she uses for several of the workouts. Zuzka uses 8 pound dumbbells for most of the exercises and I think she occasionally uses 15 lb or 20 lb weights for some of the chair exercises. I used 12-15 lb dumbbells throughout, but Zuzka shows alternate ways to complete the exercises, if you would like to just use your own body weight or lighter dumbbells.

I thought about posting a breakdown of each workout, but I believe that it is worth it to purchase these DVDs and it would be an injustice to Zuzka if I posted all her exercises here.

Here is a breakdown of the workouts on the last DVD with the time it takes to complete:

Workout 9 (12:39): 4 rounds of each of the following

10 reps of weighted squat hops
10 inverted push presses
10 push presses with dumbbells
10 competition burpees

Workout 10(12:23): 2 rounds of the following:

12 lunge curls with side lunges
20 plank pulls
20 dumbbell swings
12 tricep plank leg lifts
Bonus reps:20 dynamic burpees

Workout 11(14:14): 3 rounds of the following

30 elevated leg lunges
10 three clap push ups and burpee
20 sit up twists

Workout 12(13:19): 3 rounds of the following

20 weighted over-head squats & side leg lifts
40 chair hops
40 back lunges and knee ups
10 reptile push ups

I like Zuzka because she is very motivational. She struggles through the workouts right along with you and even takes breaks in between some exercises. After completing these exercises, I have noticed that I am stronger than I was before and I am much more toned. I am now a fan and will be purchasing her Strength Series DVDs as well!",1407024000,10,3813,4.4426934097421205

5527433,5,B00AY5JB92,"I love Zuzka's workouts. I have done her Zcut Cardio, I used to follow her Zwow's when they were free and I have her Power Yoga Vol 1.

While I absolutely love all of her workouts, the Zcut is kicking my butt. Usually I can follow right along, but the weights really add what I needed to push myself to another level, which is exactly what I was looking for. I am usually sore a few hours after the workouts and sometimes I have to throw an extra day of rest in.

I use 3, 6 and 8 lb weights,which I can combine into different combos depending on the move (like when Zuzka uses 20 lbs).

In the beginning I tried to jump right in with full weight since I have done the ZShred Cardio, but I am finally learning my limit.

I am just finished with the 1st month and I have lost a full inch off my waist, .5 inch off my thighs and almost 1 inch off my calves. I am not overweight and consider myself athletic, but I can see my legs changing shape and I love it!",1402272000,3,957,3.96875

They are pretty short workouts, anywhere from 10-15 minutes, and the cool-down is about 8 minutes. But even after one 10 minute workout, I feel really pumped and I'm sweating bullets. The next day my body definitely feels it, too. The only thing about these workouts I don't really like, is that she does burpees in almost every workout; whether it's cardio or strength. That's kind of annoying. I understand burpees are a good way to work out your body, but I'd like to have more variety than that.",1397779200,2,603,4.69811320754717

She struggles while you struggle. She pushes and so do you b/c she does. Her workouts are short but really intense. There's no music so you can listen to your own or just focus on the reps.

5527449,5,B00AY5JB92,"I'm a new fan of Zuzka.  But here is my impression.

The workouts are short and intense, but all the exercises involve several muscle groups at once so you really do a lot of work in a short time.  The routines are all varied and she shows a lot of enthusiasm and connection to her audience.  They also arrived very quickly.

Some of the reviews have mentioned the paper case.  A dollar at a department can fix that.  Besides, I think paper is better for the planet and it helps to create a high value product in that it's cheaper.

There have also been a few other criticisms regarding her figure i.e. that she may have had some work done.  So what.  You see those muscles on her legs, that perfect backside (with all respects), those amazing shoulders and arms and, finally, that dazzling waistline.  Those come from blood, sweat and tears and plenty of hard work.  Well done, Zuzka.

In short, I'm impressed with the quality and value of the workouts and the package overall.  I will be looking for other products from Zuzka.",1393891200,,1028,4.486486486486487

5527454,1,B00AY5JB92,"Initially, I rated this DVD higher because I wanted to think I might use it.  This DVD is for someone who is in extremely good shape, as in 20 year old part of the college Volleyball team.  I am in pretty good shape (I walk 3-10 miles, treadmill 2 miles, 100-200 situps) and it was very difficult.  I realize when I could not complete the warm up exercises remotely close to the instructor's form, I was in trouble.

I tried the very high-level (as in takes much strength and flexibility to just start the routines), by taking it down several levels.  I would have liked if the instructor would have offered modified moves for those just starting out.  I modified the moves on my own.  Even the instructor pauses mid-way through the burpees, breathing hard for a second.

The worst part is her brisk voice and her heavy breathing as she gets through the instructions.  I would likely put the DVD on mute and listen to my own music; if I decided to keep it.  I will likely try to resell it, well, because their is nothing fun, nor motivating about it for me.
If you are very self motivated, in very athletic shape (and I mean very athletic shape) this will be a great workout.  If you are intermediate level or even intermediate-advanced, maybe run a 5K, jump on the treadmill, like your gym's exercise classes or like to have fun while you workout, this is not for you.",1393113600,,1369,4.436

5527456,4,B00AY5JB92,"i would consider myself an advanced (albeit mentally lazy as i want to pop in a DVD and follow something early in the morning) exerciser, having done several years of HIIT including Insanity and sprints instead of steady state running when the seasons allow.  have also done p90x, supreme90Day, several of the Jari Love Get Extremely Ripped1000 series, all of which are in my normal rotation.

I appreciate the short 10-14 minute workouts, they get my heart rate up within the first 3-6 minutes.  i guess the explanations at the beginning would be helpful to those who are not familiar with the moves or as a first pass though i think she can get loquacious.  i also appreciate being able to jump a chapter ahead to get to the actual workout.

I've done the power cardio series twice over now.  the exercises are solid though i find her pace rather slow.  i can usually 1.5x or double (even quadruple - jump squats, kick ups, squat jacks with side leg lift, etc. ) the amount of each exercise in the same amount of time, and pauses in between exercises are also a tad long for me.  I have been pairing one of these workouts at the beginning of my session and then follow it up with either one of her Power Strength workouts or something like T25 Speed2 or one of Jari Love's workouts or an insanity phase 2 depending on my energy level.  i have various other series as well for change of pace such as the original Tae-bo (any subsequent variant wasn't for me), several different jillian michael's dvds , turbo jam, etc.

The annoyances:
she's constantly adjusting.  her shorts, her hair.  annoying and distracting.  i'm glad she is pleased with her surgery but we're not at the beach here, it's hard to take her seriously as a trainer.  wear different shorts that don't ride up or stop adjusting them.  and for pete's sakes, wear a headband.

also, i wasn't familiar with CrossFit burpees.  when done correctly, you jump down to plank, do a pushup to get your chest to the ground , back to plank then back up and jump.  i have always done what she refers to as a half burpee (just jump down to a plank before jumping back up) and found out about the crossfit burpees from a friend.  z is putting her stomach on the ground and lifting back up in a non-pushup-non-plank kind of way, with her knees being the last to get off the floor.  i checked with a doctor who thinks this is incorrect (and lazy) .",1392940800,,2399,4.458715596330276

5527459,4,B00AY5JB92,"Positive:

If you think of cardio as something to run screaming from, but you are OK with weights, this is the workout set for you. If you're not in shape already, you'll have to go slow until you are fit enough to keep pace with her. Not a deal breaker if you are patient. Like the format where there is a training session, then the actual workout.

Problem: Watch it now Entertainment is a good idea, but the implementation is not quite commercial grade.

The dvd's are dvd-r made to order and shipped in a cardboard sleeve. They can be picky little things to get working.
Once removed carefully from the sleeve, you need a dvd box or case to keep them in so they don't get scratched.
Then too, we put the dvd's into a new (1 year old) dvd player that handles dvd-r and they would not read. A dvd player in the next room worked with them but took forever to recognize them first. Marginal dvd reliability.

Solution:

1. Get a dvd box to hold 'em, they're about a buck.

2. If they give you problems, copy the dvd's onto new blanks with a computer. The newly copied dvd-r worked with flying colors but the ones they sent us were coasters most of the time.

Heck, I'd copy 'em anyway just in case the originals quit on me in the future.

Verdict: 5 stars for the content, 3 stars for the disks, it's a keeper.",1391904000,5,1310,4.254032258064516
5527460,5,B00AY5JB92,"This set is not for beginner or anybody with a bad knee...or a neighbor below you.

I read plenty of reviews before I buy things, but I don't take the time to actually write a review...after few months of owning this set, I really felt that Zuzka more than deserves my time to give a glowing review and thorough review as I can give.

Some reviews mentioned/complained about the card-stock case it comes in instead of traditional plastic DVD case. I personally have no problems with it. If that saves them money to offer such great DVD set for such an affordable cost, who cares? To me, it's ALL about the workout and what I get out of it.

I did not keep up with the calendar it came with (in fact, I lost it) and I did not track my weight loss or measurements. I can say I fit into things I couldn't before, look better and I sure feel much better about myself.

I'm no exercise freak or in super shape or anything like that. I'd say I'm intermidiate at this point.  I started working out couple years ago.  I realized as I'm getting older (40 isn't too far away) I have to start including regular exercise in my life. I do as much as my life allows time for (or my motivation)...I'd say about 3x a week or more on average. I'm constantly trying new things to keep it interesting and to find out what I enjoy. I've done the gym membership thing, going on a long fast pace walk, going to kick boxing classes, go out running, doing workout DVDs, etcalthough some of those things I still do some times, this DVD is truly something I do more often than anything else.  I didn't love it the first time, but more that I do, more that I love!!

I've gone through SO many workout DVDs, and none of them were worth keeping as in the end, I felt I didn't get enough out of them. i.e. I've gone through all of Jillian Michaels...did do each of them many times and they were decent workout, but I kept NONE. And on top of it, does she not realize that if we buy the DVD, we will be watching it many times? We don't want to hear about ""jean shopping"" or ""what people are saying on Twitter and facebook"" about her over and over and over. Besides, she doesn't even do the whole work out herself., but putting everything aside, in the end, you'll get 2x or more workout in Zuzka's less than 15 min.

**So here is the list of the highlights of why I LOVE this Power Cardio**

- You get 3 DVDs, 4 workouts on each DVD, total of 12 and each workout is 10~15 min.
- although they are 15 min or less, you WILL sweat and be out of breath!
- Zuzka does all the workouts! Unlike Jillian Michaels. You see Zuzka working hard and sweating! That just motivates me more.
- because they are less than 15 min, I can do in the morning or at lunch (I work from home) or after worksome times I do 2x or 3x a day because they are less than 15 min.
- she is very sweet (I don't need sweet, but) and encourages you throughout just right...no obnoxiousness
- no bunch of chatting/talking crap and no crappy music (in fact no music at all, so I can play what I want) This DVD is straight up work out!
- there is time on the bottom right of the screen, so you can get an idea of how much more you just gotta push it
- you don't need much space and you don't need anything to do the work out. (yoga mat is helpful some times if you have hardwood floor, but she doesn't use one. she has couple exercises using a chair or a block to jump over, but you can do the workout without them)

So, for me, this is the best workout DVD and worth WAY more than what I paid for.  My new purchase of Amy Dixon's breathless body (tabata training method) is another very good one I'll keep.  I will do her DVD when I have time as it's 55 min (including warm-up and cool-down), but I will do Zuzka's Power Cardio every chance I get.",1391817600,4,3777,4.108548168249661

Before, I had done fine workout plans, Insanity, Cathe Freidrich, The Pitt, Get Ripped in 90 Days, Rushfit.  Even tough, I have to say that Zuzka is the best. The workouts are simple, but very intense and effective. Zuzka explains each exercise so clearly and she is a great motivator.

5527464,5,B00AY5JB92,This is fantastic.  I did the entire 3 month program and lost 20 pounds.  I learned I could actually do push-ups.  I love that Zuzanna sweats with you and has a hard time sometimes.  It's short so it's easy to fit into a schedule and it's hard!  You can modify it if it's too hard.  I had to for the first month until I built up endurance.  I still have bad days where I can't keep up but that's ok.  Love it.,1391040000,,409,3.902439024390244

Her workouts are challenging yet feasible. She walks you through everything. And she is such a great inspiration throughout the videos. I am impressed I can do her exercises. I do yoga, some strength training, but hate cardio. So I do Zuzka's workouts instead of cardio. Zuzka is an amazing fitness instructor with a beautiful heart. Love her!

It's just as mentally and physically challenging, short, and time well spent.  The workouts are hard, but she explains them well and offers modifications for beginners.

These videos are great for overall cardio conditioning and getting into shape in general. It is definitely not a beginner if you haven't worked out in a few months or so but can be modified if you still want to try it out and give it a shot. The DVDs do come in a paper covering which to some may seem cheap but for $15.95 it's a great workout program. Also they shipped really fast. Highly recommend and if you're still not sure just check her out on her website. Zuzka is really motivating and her body alone makes you want to work hard.",1389657600,,633,4.3277310924369745

The workouts are simple , but very intense and effective.  Zuzka explain so clearly each exercise and she is a great motivator.  In addition, the price is incredible, and the deliver is excellent, I received the product in few days.  I like to train minimum one hour by day, so I do a routine of Zzka Cardio with another of Zcut Six Pack.

After only a few work outs I am noticing changes, especially in my obliques, which can be a problem area for me, and also in my legs. I've noticed that my ""skinny jeans"" are fitting a lot better. I really wanted to wait until I did the whole program before I wrote a review, but I must admit I was too excited to wait.

  These work outs are intense as I'm sure you've read in other reviews but what I like about these is that she takes time to explain each move in detail and constantly reminds you to go fast, but that it's important to keep good form. I also like how she sometimes struggles with the work out because to me it makes it seem like it's okay to struggle, just don't give up.

Overall definitely worth the $15. I really think if a person truly commits to doing these along with a healthy diet they will see results.",1388793600,,1016,4.1421319796954315

This is the first time in years I have been able to make the scale budge and see visible results!  I am only one month in!!!  Previously I tried BeachBody's Power 90 and I absolutely love Tony Horton, don't get me wrong, those were great workouts, but I got incredibly bored with them and then because of that became inconsistent and slowly just stopped working out.....Zuzka is SOOOO motivating and it is a kind of self-challenge which I love.  I can push myself as hard as I want on any given day and the fact that there are 12 routines keeps it exciting :)  Best work out DVD purchase ever!!! Also, the customer service was amazing.

These videos are really fantastic, and I LOVE that there is not background music (so you can play your own), AND she doesn't do any stupid dialogue when working out, just the basics of counting and a bit of encouragement (Not like someone else you may know who loves to hear the sound of his own voice on his DVDs, 'Do your best and forget the rest!').

After that I joined her zgym (love it by the way), but recently decided to re-incorporate this dvd and try to increase strength again.  When I first did the workouts I could lift 5 lbs (I know, I know), at the end I could lift 10, now I'm at 15 and I'm eyeing my husband's 20 lb weights.  This dvd is amazing on its own, or incorporated with her other workouts.  On a side note - I did low impact, low weight pilates and barree workouts for years (TA anyone?).  I'm afraid I bought into that ""get bulky"" myth.  I'm Swedish and Irish and was certain that if I did intense strength workouts I'd end up looking like my father.  Well, that hasn't happened.  I do have alot of muscle now (I'm sure that's due to heredity to some extent), but my shape has never been better or more feminine.

5527492,5,B00AY5JB92,Zuka is such a genuine workaholic she encourages and motivates better than many other trainers. I enjoy doing this workout and am a man. The affect so far have been 20 pounds lost and a lot more mobility on the basketball court. I believe this disc is on par with insanity and P90x but it also bring the same quality results as both combined so for the money I think this is definately worth a try.,1386288000,,398,4.25

5527494,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been doing Zuzka's workouts for 9 weeks now, mostly the Zwow workouts that are available on You Tube.  A couple weeks ago I began using these DVDs and, as expected, they are incredible.  If you're familiar with Zuzka, you'll know what to expect:  high intensity, fast-paced, effective workouts in about 12 - 15 minutes.  Minimal equipment is required (at most you'll need a chair & some dumbbells), and if you're limited on space, that's not a problem either.

Since my early 20's, I've been into health & fitness and have just about tried it all (as you can tell by my other reviews on this site.)  When I hit a wall with a routine or DVD, I don't stop working out, I simply find something else that suits me.  Due to the variety offered by Zuzka, both on DVDs and her website, I cannot imagine getting bored with these types of workouts, and they're over too fast to feel like a chore - I love that.

I consider myself to be at the intermediate level.  I don't have to pause the DVDs or take breaks, and most of the time I can use the same weight Zuz is using (but not always!)  That being said, these workouts always pack a punch - especially workouts #1 & #12.  When the workout is over, I'm positively drenched in sweat, which may sound disgusting, but I love it.  To me, sweat = accomplishment.  I work out first thing in the morning, and by 5:45 a.m., I'm done and ready to tackle whatever else may come my way.  I feel amazing:  invigorated, invincible . . . . trust me, when you finish a session and you're standing there, face flushed and pink, breathing heavily, your body glazed in perspiration, you'll feel like a bad a**, a glowing, sweaty goddess (who desperately needs a shower).

Since beginning Zuz's workouts I can say that, without a doubt, my muscles have become more sculpted and defined, something my husband has nicely mentioned as well. :)  While I didn't need to lose weight, my body composition has changed - I've lost body fat and gained lean muscle mass.  My cardio endurance has also improved.  Every day at work, I take the stairs to my office - 6 flights.  I used to feel myself breathing a little heavier by the 3rd or 4th floor.  Now I SPRINT up that last flight with no problem.  I'll be turning ""the big 4-0"" next year (gasp) and I feel that I am absolutely in the best shape of my life, thanks to Zuz.

I'll be purchasing more of her DVDs (I also have the 1st yoga DVD, which I highly recommend even to those who 'don't like yoga'). The production quality, cuing, and menu/chaptering configuration are excellent - far superior to most fitness DVDs I own (and cost considerably more than these, by the way).  I'm also going to sign up for Zgym, since I like real-time, up-to-the-minute workouts and the personalized feel they have.

If you're serious about getting in shape, and if you enjoy workouts that get down to business, I suggest you give these a try.  Let's be honest:  who can't spare 15 minutes in the name of health and fitness?  It's SO worth the time and effort.  Nothing else compares.",1386288000,26,3041,4.448462929475587

Its doable but not in the time that she does it it is quite a challenge and she loves those stinking burpees. Definitely not good for a person with bad knees. I will do it but I will just have to challenge myself.

I hate her lol but I love her because she struggles some too and they are small workouts but my heart feels like it is about to exit my body lol One day I will be able to keep up with her

She has a great warmup (it feels like you are really working, too- I hate it when warm ups feel like a fluffy waste of time) and the workouts are different and they really get your heart rate up and make you feel strong. I feel like if I don't get sweaty, it's not really a good workout and I think it's impossible to do one of her workouts and not get sweaty. I have told ALL my friends to get her dvds- if I ever hear someone say they want to lose weight I will just send them the link and tell them there is no way they could do these dvds and not be in shape (along with reasonable eating that is!!). The other thing that is so great about Zuzka is that there are so many instructors (on dvd and in person) who I just find their manner scary/annoying for whatever reason- I don't like feeling like I have a drill sergeant yelling at me- but Zuzka seems so pleasant and cheerful and FIT! Who knows what she is really like, but based on her videos and blogs she seems like such a good soul- she is truly inspiring and I find myself telling everyone about her! I liked these dvds so much I also bought the power strength series and the yoga and I subscribe to her Z-gym too (all less for joining a gym, yay!)",1381276800,12,1864,4.194986072423398
5527514,5,B00AY5JB92,The work outs on this DVD are amazing. I have been a fan of Zuzka for a long time. I am glad that she finally came out with some DVDs. She does a fantastic job of explaining what she is doing. The routine is set up so you are constantly challenging yourself to beat your old time. I loved every work out.,1381190400,,304,3.9193548387096775

I have ordered a lot of DVD's that have come in either the plastic covers or cardboard covers.  100% of the ones that come in the cardboard covers comes scratched and 8% of the DVD's that come in plastic covers come scratched.

ETA My DVD came scratch because of the cardboard packaging and because of the scratch the DVD would not play.",1381104000,3,406,4.45945945945946

5527521,4,B00AY5JB92,"I really love Zuzka but these workouts are the same as all her other routines. I am really happy to have this dvd because I can come back to it anytime. However, I would recommend subscribing to her ZGYM because you could spend the same amount for 3 months of workouts in ZGYM as one month with this dvd. That being said, I have followed her for years so I have all her routines written down and I don't have to spend a dime but I want to support her. This dvd is good for people who are trying to follow a new regimen. I highly recommend working out with Zuzka, she is the s*** and with her help you can change your life!!",1380672000,6,623,4.032258064516129

You get 4 very short workouts per DVD, about 10-12 minutes, no more.
Bonus workout is the same in all 3DVD's. Why?
Presentation is very poor, simple paper sleeve.

I have done the 3 DVDs through twice, and it was a little easier the second time through.  After doing Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and ripped in 30, I wanted something else that was short.  These fit the bill, short but effective!  These were hard, even after doing the Jillian series.  Highly recommend!",1379721600,,449,4.67948717948718

The only issue for me here was a few exercises called for heavier weights that I do not have, so I just used the weights I had. Also, one of the moves where you jump down into a knee push up position caused me to get bad rug burn on both knees, because I did it on carpet and didn't use my yoga mat.  (Very dumb- be sure to use a mat!). Highly recommend!!",1379721600,,533,4.0476190476190474

Plus she goes hard but also gets tired like you. Plus the DVDs are a great price and ""Watch It Now Entertainment"" has great service and super fast shipping.

This is one of my favorite workouts. I love the Power Cardio workouts and I like to do at least 2 workouts, or I mix one of these with the Power Cardio or Power Abs workout. This will definitely make you sweat and feel stronger.",1379203200,,727,4.345588235294118

saw all the positive reviews and now i see why. This chick has an amazing spirit and and amazing body. I am sure if anyone follows her workouts they will lose weight fast. I did both Workout # 1 and Workout # 2 already and I can already feel the difference in my body changing. The workouts are short but super intense. I barely was able to complete each workout to the level of Zuzana but I was able to chime in and out and complete the workout. At the end I was out of breath and drenched in sweat. I have done plenty of workout programs, Insanity, P90X, TurboFire, Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and the list goes on however what i like most is that Zuzana is simple and to the point which makes her workouts super effective. And on a side note for the ones mentioning the lack of music makes it boring, I find that I am able to focus more on the workout without the music. Also, I am able to hear Zuzana's breathing cues which is awesome so I don't fall out from holding my breath.

I'm on workout 6 so far and I have to say, I absolutely loved every workout so far and missed weights in cardio program so I'm glad I use them again.

That should be made more clear when you buy it, but it is awesome.  I find myself doing the warm-up even before I walk the dog or do any other excercise.  It just wakes up your whole body and feels great.  I haven't lost any weight yet, but have firmed up and feel much stronger.  I played golf recently after doing the workouts M-F for 2 months and really felt like I was driving the ball much harder.

I have seen great improvement in my strength since doing these, and my arms look amazing, thanks to all the push-ups and burpees!

I am a busy professional vocalist currently singing aboard a Holland America Ship. So, it was important for me to find a program that would allow me to stay in shape & build defined muscles/lose fat. Looking good (even at 50) is important in my profession. With the added plus of Zuzka's workouts being very short (only 12-15 minutes long), that also sold me. I couldn't be happier with the results I'm seeing and I just finished week two! I love the new definition I am seeing  along with the fat loss that occurs doing her workouts. What I also appreciate about this DVD Series is that it comes with a 3, one month calendars so you never have to guess what workout to do. It's all there with great inspirational to keep you focused. On the DVD's Zuzka, in great details breaks down each exercise in her workouts so you're not compromising form. That is very important. Now, these workouts are NOT EASY! Admittedly, I have been a fan of Zuzka's since her Bodyrocktv.com days and have worked out with her since way back when and her ZWOW's. However, these workouts are super-duper intense and will require everything you've got! But, don't give up!!

5527572,5,B00AY5JB92,"These are intense cardio workouts that aren't too long, which I like because I focus on weightlifting and muscle building. With the time I put into my weight workouts, I don't have a lot of extra time, but these are perfect because of the intensity.  I am exhausted and sweating 5 minutes into it. This is great for travel because you don't need any equipment (I haven't gotten to the 3rd disc yet but no equipmt on the first 2). I also like that I can put the disk in and look at the outline of the exercises to be done for a particular workout.  I write them down on a piece of paper then walk to a local school to do the workout.  I use a low brick wall when doing exercises requiring a chair. I live in a 2nd fl apartmt and worry about my neighbor down stairs (He can hear me during my Insanity workouts :() so this workout is perfect for taking outside. The workouts include burpees, jump squats, jump tucks, high knees, long jumps, chair step ups, jump lunges, jack kicks, mule kicks, triceps dips, abs work... I can't remember them all. For example, the first workout - if I can recall it correctly - goes like this:

10 burpees
10 jump tucks
10 burpees
20 jump lunges
10 burpees
30 kickups
10 burpees
40 jack kicks
10 burpees.

5527578,5,B00AY5JB92,I've been a fan of Zuzka for some time now and I found her on youtube and have been following her ZWOW's workout every week. Just watching her videos made me so motivated to work out and that I can achieve having the same body type as hers. The great thing about this program is you that you don't have to use any weights or equipments its all your body weight. To sum up her workout its like doing and Insanity workout in 15 minutes. Its intense and you will sweat. Since doing this program I saw results I was in shape already but this program toned my body up especially in the abs I had definition in my body. I truly believe in Zuzka and what she does and would recommend this program to people. Where else can you find a workout program dvd set with this great price???? This will change your life I know it did for me honestly I use to spend and hour to 2 hours at the gym but when I started this workout program all you need is a good 10-20 minutes of fast interval training workout with a balanced diet to get results. So if you want to see results get this program.,1376006400,,1075,4.099526066350711

5527580,5,B00AY5JB92,I have been following Zuzka on youtube for a while. I love the intense workout she provides but didn't care for watching it on my computer. VERY excited when she released these dvd's. I definitely don't regret buying. One of my favorite things about these workouts is Zuzka herself. She is with you the whoooole time. No slacking on her part at all!!!!! She is amazing. Her short workouts leave you NO excuse not to workout. Thank you so much Zuzka!,1375747200,,449,4.555555555555555
5527581,5,B00AY5JB92,"These workouts are short in duration but hit all your muscle groups at once. To add additional cardio I pause between each round and do a 3-5 min. jump rope and then continue on with the next round. It's also great for at home gym I can do this at what ever time I need to work into my work and housework schd. My 10 yr. old wataches me and she gets motivated and does 10 reps of burpees, pushups and abs herself during her free time. I love these workouts. I will check out her Yoga to incorporate between ZCut and free rest day workouts.",1375747200,,539,4.09433962264151

5527583,5,B00AY5JB92,"I had been recommended this DVD set by friends of mine, and I'm SOOOOO glad I bought it. I'm at the beginning level of fitness, but the workouts can be modified to my level- and as I progress I can push that much further in my workouts. I will definitely use these DVDs in my workout routine, as well as the ZCUT Power Strength Series 3 DVD set :)",1375574400,,347,4.043478260869565
5527584,5,B00AY5JB92,I ordered this series as I was a follower on you tube. This series doesn't disappoint. It is what I wanted/needed. Short intense work outs. My only complaint is that on each CD the bonus is the same. I would have liked a new bonus on each CD.,1375488000,,242,4.0625
5527585,5,B00AY5JB92,I am following Zuzka since the bodyrock days and this was a way to support her cause. I love her exercises and its nicely done. Videos are clear and instructions as well.,1375488000,,170,4.34375
5527586,5,B00AY5JB92,"Aug 2013: This is a great program.  You can also watch the daily coaching videos that Zuzanna has on You Tube.  The coaching videos go hand in hand with the DVDs.  The workouts are short and right to the point.  Best work-out coach I've had.

Update November 6th: With proper eating habits and Zuzka, my total weight loss for 90 days was 33 pounds.

I went from a size 14 to a 10. I started the ZCUT Strength DVDs on August 1st.  I did the warm-up, workout, and cool down 5 days a week and supplemented off-days with yoga or Jackie Warner.  When I first started the Strength DVDs, I couldn't do half the exercises, even without weights.  I altered routines so I could stay in motion for the whole video.  For example, the pistol squat, I used a chair or did the squat with both legs.  For burpees, I wasn't able to ""jump"" up at first, but I could stand up.  Anything is better than nothing.  My goal was to practice form and stay in motion for the entire length of the workout.  From the repetition, or perhaps carrying the lighter load from the gradual weight-loss, the routines became easier. After 3 months, there are still some exercises that I cannot do with weights or even at all....so the challenge remains.  I skip episode 10, the only one I don't care for, I can't even remember what's on it now.  I watched many, if not all, the Zuzka coaching videos on Youtube.  I found that very helpful.  I also purchased the Power Cardio Series and the first Yoga DVD, but I always go back to the Strength Series.  I highly recommend purchasing these DVDs.  In comparison to other programs, they are a tenth of the price.  I don't need a gym membership when I have Z.",1375315200,3,1666,4.361563517915309
5527587,5,B00AY5JB92,"Ok, here is my honest opinion:

I loved her from bodyrock and still wanted to follow her so I bought these DVDs mainly in support. What I love about her is her genuine personality and how realistic she is. I did the whole beach body thing and compared to those DVDs this series will probably disappoint you if that's what you are expecting- not because they aren't good workouts but this is a woman trying to make a comeback and doesn't have millions backing her! She doesn't have all the extras it's solely her doing the workouts with you which personally I LOVE! She also isn't perfectly scripted but I like that's she's not pretending to be some big time fitness star she's just like you and me- she gets out of breath and sweaty with you while trying to film a DVD I'm not judging her because I can hardly breath while doing these workouts let alone talk and count through them...good for her! I just got done training for road races and my running was so time consuming so what I love most is that all the workouts are 12-15 minutes long and I still get a wicked workout so much so that I've been sore for a solid two weeks and haven't repeated a workout yet.  So overall I can enjoy the simple things in life and this has turned into one of my favorites! Did I mention I think I can already see results and I feel awesome :) Buy it!",1375228800,,1338,4.243137254901961
5527588,5,B00AY5JB92,"I was skeptical about ordering the videos because while I have been a big fan of Zuzka's since BodyRock, I have NEVER been able to keep up with that pace. If I made it through a whole workout, I was sore painfully sore for 3 days after so I would give up.

I only have 2 weeks left of this program and I will be getting the ZCut and joining the ZGym.

These videos are worth more than the $15 they are being sold for as they have 4 workout on each disk plus warm up, cool down and bonus abs. I really feel the breakdown of the moves in the upcoming workout are what really helped me be successful as I could practice them until I got then right before moving on to the actual work out. Or if I want to do the workout on my own but forget some of it, I can watch the breakdown and be reminded.

The calendar makes it so easy and motivating. I love marking the days down, comparing my times and my measurements each week. I have lost 7 pounds and almost 3 sizes and I still have 2 weeks to go. My hips lost 4 inches, my waist lost 4 1/2 inches, my calves lost an inch, and my thighs have gone down 3 inches. My arms are defined, I can see my abs and I am more energized and my confidence is back.

Zuzka is very motivating during the workouts, encouraging you to keep going and the time clock usually displays on the screen showing your progress. There is no music, but I actually enjoy being able to play my own as most music in workout videos are horrible anyway.

Also, if I had questions the customer service on the website was very quick about getting back to me. I know I will be using these workout for longer than the 3 months outlined.",1375228800,12,1642,4.04

These are challenging and have lots of variation to keep you interested. They are not long, but you will work up a sweat.  I will use them as add ons.  I feel these lean more towards advance, but can be modified for intermediate (as she shows you throughout). The price is right too!!",1375056000,,416,4.227848101265823
5527593,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am an advanced exerciser, with 100s of fitness videos to my name, and I honestly think that Zuzka's ZCut Power Strength and Power Cardio DVD Series provide more bang for the buck than any other videos in my extensive collection. Unlike many followers of this Youtube sensation, I am new to the Zuzka Light bandwagon, having never known her in her Bodyrock.tv days. For those who were also asleep under the same rock I was napping under, Zuzka is of Czech heritage and is a former ""adult movie"" actress turned online fitness trainer sensation (I think she has more followers on her Youtube channel than any other fitness expert), and she definitely knows her stuff. Her workouts are brief but powerful - metabolic conditioning reminiscent of Crossfit (minus the Olympic lifting and gymnastics moves), and they provide an incredible burn in just 23-20 minutes per workout. Zuzka is not only beautiful, but she has a great personality and is motivating without being annoying (which in itself is annoying since she is also so beautiful...). The videos are high-quality - Zuzka uses the same company Bob Harper uses for his knew The Skinny Rules videos, which explains why the workout calendars and DVD covers for these programs look so similar. That being said, Zuzka's workouts are hands down better than Bob's in terms of the variety and intensity, and she explains and demonstrates the moves much better than he does as well. If you want a workout that gives you an incredible cardio and strength burn in a short period of time, order this now - at just under $16 for 13 workouts and a warm-up and cool-down, I haven't come across a better value. While you're at it, order her Cardio Series as well, which is equally as impressive (and also just under $16). And if you cannot get enough of Zuzka after doing these workouts, go to her Youtube channel where she has more than 70 free ZWOW workouts (i.e., Zuzka's Workout of the Week). That should keep you busy for a while! 5 stars for someone I predict will go far in the fitness industry!",1375056000,8,2040,4.701117318435754

5527599,4,B00AY5JB92,"Very few people have talked about the quality of this instructor's movement. She's a perfectionist when it comes to modeling the movement for her viewers--even when she's working hard--and breaking down the movement so it can be understood. I suspect, in fact, that there are  workouts during which her time could be faster than it is, but she's moving more slowly and deliberately than other, less thoughtful instructors (and cardio freaks) would. I am a fitness enthusiast--I lift weights, run, swim,etc., etc.--and while I'm not perfect, I do know the difference between a hack and someone who really knows their stuff. I think Zuzka trumps Jillian Michaels, Tracey Anderson, and many other celebrity trainers who are more famous than she. Her instruction and workouts are also better than other similar sites with free workouts. I do think a person can go far simply by following the workouts that are available for free already, via the interwebs, however, if you like to have a program, and/or you are someone who is looking to ""get back into it"" the calendar and progression are definitely helpful.  The four rating is only because ""love"" for any product seems a little bit hyperbolic, and I do not want to give the impression I'm working for anyone.",1374451200,4,1257,4.95260663507109

Also, on some days for the second and third month, you would be doubling up some of the workouts, which is great!
There is also an ab bonus (very intense btw) which you can do on your rest days.

5527615,5,B00AY5JB92,"I'm a 42 year old male and have been following Zuzka on Bodyrock and then Zuzkalight.com.  I have been weight training for a few decades (I am 6-1, 193lbs ~11% bf) and have incorporated HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) into my routine to help cut bodyfat.  Originally taking the low intensity cardio route, I learned after many years that this was ineffective and began focusing on HIIT style cardio such as Tabata.

Zuzka's workouts are appealing because there is a large variety of exercises, she is very pleasant in demeanor (unlike some of the other instructors in other programs), and they work well.  I never fail to finish a workout without dripping in sweat and having my heart rate way up.  This series is excellent, with a nice variety, exercises that can be done in almost any environment with no extra equipment (I have done them in my basement, in hotel rooms, etc), and clear instruction on how to do each exercise before it starts.

For the price of this set, you really cannot go wrong, and considering you can do each one multiple times before getting bored, you are getting months worth of workouts for under $20 (including shipping).

5527617,5,B00AY5JB92,"I'll start by saying that I found the Bodyrock website a couple of years ago and thought that it was a really great concept, but unfortunately I couldn't keep up with the videos...it was hard to search for them/figure out a routine to follow so I never did.

So when I was on Amazon.com looking for a new workout DVD and saw this one, I WAS SO EXCITED!

I just did DVD1/Workout 1 and in just 20 minutes, I was sweating and definitely feeling it. I love how she does the workout right along with you and the fact that she is sweating and breathing hard really helps you get through it...because I can see HER doing it and it motivates me to keep going too.

I also love that she has such a thorough cool down. I feel like a lot of exercise DVDs really skimp on this part and leave you on your own for it. But Zuzka stretches every muscle and also incorporates some yoga poses, which is a huge plus!

I also can't believe the amount of variety that comes with this 3-disc set. I have a problem with getting bored of the same old routines, but I know I won't be with this set! Especially because there is bonus workout on each disc.

Shipping was also EXTREMELY fast. Oh, and the addition of the workout calendar is also great! Extra motivating to hang that up and track your workouts!

I already can't wait to workout tomorrow!",1373846400,,1325,4.258964143426295

One minor dislike - I didn't like the count backwards timing. Maybe it's just me but I kinda find the last 5 secs ticking more thrilling and it is more suspense to see what timing she achieved at the end. Overall, this is a good complement to power cardio and I really love these!",1373846400,,432,4.4125

I like alternating this DVD with the ZCUT cardio workouts, ZWOWs, and Zshreds- it's impossible to get bored and I'm in better shape than ever before, and I know I will only improve thanks to Zuzka's amazing, challenging, quick workouts.

It is cheaply made and the music is not great, but honestly I can not hear anything but myself breathing super hard. At the end I am drenched in sweat.

I had lost some weight using one of those 2 shakes a day diets and working out but I hit a wall and had been stuck ever since. Well, fast forward a few months in and I'm almost at my goal weight. I started doing Zuzka's Power cardio series and started losing weight and gaining muscle. Shortly after finishing that series, these workouts became available and they have put me over the top. I haven't been this small in like ten years or so. I am beyond happy with the results. I've gotten so many compliments on my transformation and I literally can't believe my own eyes when I see what I've accomplished with her workouts. I can't recommend these DVD's enough. These are short yet intense workout. I can keep up with her way more than when I began in January. I've lost 20 pounds, 10 more to go.

These are no frills videos - no fancy sets, no extra people working out - just Zuzka, and no distracting music.  I like this because I can play my own tunes if I want.  I also like the fact that I can write these workouts down (they are simple) and do them on my own if I want to have a movie or TV show on for distraction - or if I'm traveling and don't have access to DVD player.  The workouts use exercises that target the full body rather than just arms or just legs - again making them more time efficient.  I like that they added an option to just do the workout without the explanation - which is a nice feature.  I would recommend these videos to folks who like a straightforward workout that is short and no nonsense yet also a bit more interesting than just straight calisthenics.",1372809600,2,864,4.237804878048781

Easy to follow and she doesn't make you feel like a loser if you are panting and out of breath halfway through, cause she's busting her rear too. I've followed her on BodyRock and couldn't bring myself to go back after she left. It was like I lost a friend, so when she came out with ZWOW I just had to transition.

5527662,2,B00AY5JB92,"Because of the rave reviews I thought, wow, this must be good. Sure, the exercises would be effective, are very challenging and uncomplicated, but the extreme repetition and absence of music made these workouts a huge chore with a serious dread factor and no fun at all. Just a string of certain exercises repeated over and over. (By the way, unlike these, her Yoga DVD has music and is not too bad). I have an extensive collection of exercise DVDs (around 500) with top notch instructors and quality workouts where this product simply cannot compete. But I realize tastes are different so you might just have to try for yourself. For me, these are just lackluster non-choreographed routines with a home video kind-of-feel to it.
It also irritated me that the packaging is cardboard. Haven't they learned anything from the days of P90X and the PeakFit series that DVDs that slide in and out of cardboard get scratched faster than you can say workout? I was lucky that mine arrived in excellent condition and I carefully and slowly eased them out of the sleeves to put in real DVD cases but I see that others here got damaged ones.

I really would recommend this dvd to anyone out there who wants to get in an amazing shape, feel energized and feel like someone is supporting you in this journey because with Z, you'll NEVER feel left out!!

I started with the ZWOW series on Youtube and loved them so much that I decided to go ahead and get this series. The workouts are super hard but even if your a beginner you should try them. I'm practically a beginner so I have to pause the dvd several times to try and keep up but this is a good thing for me. As I get in better shape and continue the series I know that eventually I won't need to pause the dvd and will be able to keep up with her.

Zuzana is awesome. She pushes just as hard as she wants you to push. She's very motivating and seeing her work that hard makes me want to work just as hard. Just realize that these workouts are TOUGH! You need to remember that and have the motivation to push yourself to the limit. It's okay if your workout times are a lot longer than hers. My first exercise (just workout  1 not including warm up ad cool down) took me 25 minutes but I know when I go back I'll beat that time. Just work as hard as you can and you'll see.

5527720,5,B00AY5JB92,"All I have to say is Zuzka blows away any workouts I have in my collection (I have huge collection of workouts you name it I probably have) and Zuzka is by far one of my top favorites for being quick but to the point and the price for all the work outs is Extremely affordable!!! Comparing to my collection, ZUZKA is my favorite!!!!",1371513600,,332,4.203125

5527723,5,B00AY5JB92,"So first I just wanted to start out this review by saying DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT buy this work out DVD if you are severely overweight or completely out of shape because it will be impossible for you. I have been athletic my whole life and have on and off worked out my whole life. Recently I have been working out 4 times a week for the last 3 months and this video was still extremely difficult for me. To the point where I thought I was going to faint. I am already in pretty good shape, I just really want to get more toned.

But if you just have a little bit of extra fat or consider yourself to be in decent shape I would definitely give this video a try. I have used it twice and I honestly feel like I can see results already. However, these work outs are no joke.

I will continue to do the videos and will give an update on my results! So far so good though!",1371340800,2,868,3.9261363636363638

At the end of the workout I feel so tired (maybe a little sore) but so good. I recommend these to EVERYBODY!!",1371340800,,383,4.319444444444445

The 12 sessions are all different so I will never be bored. Not only that, compared to my first day and now, I feel stronger, lost body fat and replaced it with lean muscle.

Also the personal trainer can adjust the exercises as per our body. Example Ankle problem, so he designs the exercises around that ankle without hurting it.  But over all I found this very helpful.

I am already at a low weight and was hoping to tone up with these DVD's. They definitely helped give me a bit of muscle definition, but the biggest change was my endurance levels. I used to get tired quickly when running or sprinting, and I've noticed since finishing this workout my endurance has increased a lot.

The workouts generally last 10 minutes or at most 15. there is a mixture of time challenge workout and time set (the most round in 10 minutes). I always end up sweating up :)

I love that she participates, breathes hard, and takes breaks. It encourages me that I'm not the only one who is challenged by moves and repetitions. She is too and she is pure muscle. The workouts never stop being hard but the amount I can do increases.

And T=these are PERFECT for people who travel a lot too. They're fast, simple, and require nothing but your own body strength. I can't tell you how many times I've thought I was too tired to work out, but knowing I only have to push for 10-12 minutes I do it anyway and am so pleased afterwards.

 You do NOT need a gym membership! You do NOT need any fancy equipment!

You can do these workouts with no equipment at all (well, maybe a chair but you can easily find one of those under your butt!). Zuzana uses a pair of dumbbells in these workouts, i don't have dumbbells i use a pair of gallon milk jugs filled with water! You can make these workouts more challenging by adding more weight, but i don't see that happening for me anytime soon!

These workouts are mostly 12 minutes long each, with a warm up and a cool down you are DONE with your daily workout in under 30 minutes!

I cannot tell you how happy I am with Zuzana's work! She is a serious motivator! Don't give up! Keep going! Do an easier variation if you need to just don't stop!

I initially thought, there would be more workouts on the dvd (linke one for each day) but this doesn`t matter. They don`t get boring at all.
I really have to admit, that I hated Zuzanne during some of the workouts (especially when I think about workout nr. 2), but appreciated her much more afterwards ;).

Already after one week of following the programm, I really felt better, healthier and stronger. The results are also visible, within a short period of time. I also love the calendars, that where included, to follow the plan.

All in all, I would always buy the dvd set again. As soon as the Yoga Series and the new Power strength series are both available within Europe I will also order them. This should guarantee enough variety.

I started the power strength series today and boy oh boy it was fun , tough and energizing all at the same time! The moves zuzka uses are so creative and even though you are dying from Manmakers for example you're having a lot of fun! I plan to use these DVDs in conjunction with her power cardio series and maybe a short pilates workout because these Short workouts feel me with energy and endorphins zuzka is amazing and fun to workout with but I don't plan to use other workout sources besides the occasional mile run to prep for the color run :) I will edit this review and post about  my 30 day progress later but I was so excited I just had to post now ! I'm not worried about the quick workout times at all because I was doing short intense (not as intense as zuzka though ) hiit workouts before Zuzka an gaining a bit a leg strength and definition but I fell off the wagon during Ap testing. I believe consistency and diet is key above all and can't wait to progress with these workouts !

5527761,5,B00AY5JB92,"My line of work requires me to sit at a desk around 8-9 hours a day, so Zuzana's workouts are great for me. Not only are they short, they are efficient, challenging, and it's not as difficult to fit them into a busy schedule.

I echo the other positive reviews as her cardio series did help drop ~1% of my body fat (which is huge for me because when you get to the lower percentages, around 20%, it starts to get tougher to lose them especially for women I feel), along with workouts that focuses mainly on weight-lifting.

I did WO #1 earlier and I felt great after doing it, even if my heart rate wasn't as high as when I do the cardio series, there's muscle burn instead. I do have to note though, that when doing her exercise called ""Manmaker"", I have to be careful when in a plank position with the base of my palm resting on the weights, especially when it adds a pushup with one-arm row. Do wear workout gloves or weight-lifting gloves that help protect your palm because it does get painful with the weight of your body bearing down on the base of your palm with only a thin bar of metal underneath.

Great series to add to your workout collection nevertheless!",1370217600,3,1169,4.328767123287672

5527763,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been doing Zuzana's workouts for a few years (ever since she helped co-found Body Rock TV), and just love how encouraging and motivational she is! I've left reviews for her other two DVDs (the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ZCUT-Power-Cardio-Series-3-Dvd-Set/dp/B00AY5JB92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ZCUT Power Cardio Series 3 Dvd Set</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ZCUT-Power-Yoga-Vol-1/dp/B00C7C1J68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ZCUT Power Yoga Vol 1</a>, which I just love, and know that this series will also become a favorite of mine.

Unlike the Power Cardio Series, this new series doesn't come in hard DVD cases, but rather the thin envelope sleeves that the Power Yoga workout came in.  I like this since I'm running out of room in the bookcases where I keep my workout DVDs.

Zuzana's (whose nickname is Zuzka, which is why you'll see her name both ways) workouts are always short and yet intense, allowing you to get a great workout in a short amount of time. The Power Cardio Series was focused on cardio workouts, but this new series uses weights and resistance.

The three DVDs contain a total of 12 all-new workouts and a bonus workout (that is just under 12 minutes long). The DVDs are pressed DVDs, and not DVD-r, and are good quality; I was able to play them on my laptop and my regular DVD player.

Each of the three disks contains a Warm-Up (about 6:50 minutes) and a Cooldown (about 8:50 minutes) that you can select to do at the beginning or end of your workout. Another nice feature is that each separate workout has two options:  a breakdown of the workout + the workout *or* the workout only.  This is great for when you know the routine and just want to jump right in.

When you select the Breakdown option for each workout, the first thing you'll see on the screen (as with the Cardio Series) is a listing of the exercises you'll be doing and a small screen that shows Zuzana doing the workout. If you choose the breakdown option, she'll also mention tips for how much weight to use and will include form pointers.

The moves include both weighted and non-weighted moves.  For instance, in the Bonus workout, she has you do burpees, then grab a dumbbell and do weighted one-legged pistol squats, then chair hops, then dive bombers. Because she integrates cardio and plyo moves into each workout, I can see that your heart rate will stay elevated the entire time.

There is impact in a lot of the moves, but I think you could modify them and make them more low-impact. Some of the moves also seem to be pretty advanced, but I've also found that I can make a move ""my own"" by modifying it a bit if I'm not quite at Zuzka's level.

As with the Cardio Power Series, there is a countdown timer on the screen to keep you motivated, and the rotation calendar is large and of nice quality. The main portion of each workout ranges between 10-15 minutes long.  If you do the warm-up, breakdown, workout, and cool down, it'll bring your workout to about 30 minutes.

Unlike the Cardio set, there is some music in the background of each workout, but it's kind of generic electronic music. It's actually pretty quiet, so I think that if you wanted to play your own music in the background, you easily could. The set is also nice-looking, with purple and pink walls.

Also, to do these workouts, you'll need a chair and some dumbbells in varying sizes. If you're just starting out, Zuzana recommends using your own body weight up to four-pound dumbbells.  If you're intermediate, she mostly recommends 5-9 pounds, and, if you're advanced, she recommends 10+ pounds. In a few of the workouts, she uses 20-pounders, so you definitely need a range if you want to be challenged.

The DVDs arrived along with a workout calendar for the first month.  It is just like the one that came with her Power Cardio series, except that this one focuses on cycling through these 12 workouts.  She has you do the workouts in order, with three days on, one day off, two days on, one day off, and then repeat.

As with the first set of DVDs, you are supposed to download the calendars for months 2 and 3 once you finish your first month.  I had been hoping that the included workout calendar would combine the two series, but it doesn't.  Hopefully she'll put some tips for combining them up on her blog or Facebook page, but, in the meantime, I plan on combining one workout from each series each day.

The shipping and turnaround on this was also really fast -- much faster than it was for her previous two DVDs.  I ordered my Power Strength Series on Thursday (the first day they were up for sale), and they arrived on Monday.

The set also came with a newsletter, which said that Zuzka will be doing the same free online coaching that she did with her first cardio series starting in mid-July.  In the newsletter, she also mentioned that her website is going to be re-designed soon, and that she'll be adding a new workout series called ZShred, which is supposed to launch soon.  (The newsletter doesn't mention if there will be a cost for the series, but does say that ZWows will continue to be offered at her website, too.)

Overall, this is another great set that should get awesome results! I plan to start using these workouts this week, and will update my review as I use them more.

I hope that this review was helpful, and if you have questions, let me know and I'll do my best to answer them.

UPDATE ON 9/6/13: I noticed that these workouts are selling for over $100, so I wanted to mention here that these should only cost about sixteen dollars + four dollars shipping from Watch It Now Entertainment (as sold through Amazon), which is the company that produces and sells all of Zuzana's workouts. The other retailers who are selling this set for exorbitant prices are just taking advantage of consumers.

On a different note, someone on a fitness forum I'm active on mentioned that when she moved from doing hour-long workouts to just doing 2-3 ZCut workouts a day (mostly these strength ones), she was able to drop weight and is now, at 52, in the best shape of her life. I've been using these workouts mostly as add-ons to other workouts I do, but that post inspired me to start using my ZCut workouts more!",1370217600,80,6323,4.752285191956124
5527764,5,B00AY5JB92,"I was SO excited when I heard about ZCUT Power Strength.  As someone who has been strength training for a while, I was excited to add some ""Z Power"" to my routine!  First off, I ordered the DVD's on May 31 (when they were released) and was shocked when they arrived in the mail on Monday.  I am a Prime member, and these came as fast as my Prime purchases.  VERY IMPRESSED!

Onto the workouts:  I wondered if the workouts would look a lot different from the ZCUT Power Cardio, and I was pleased to see that the format is the same.  The difference is the emphasis on strength.  There is a good emphasis on weight-bearing exercises, but they are still great cardio workouts.  I am excited about the results I will be able to achieve by adding these workouts to my ZCUT Power Cardio.

GET THESE DVDs!!!  GO Warriorz!",1370217600,3,813,4.3533333333333335
5527765,5,B00AY5JB92,I've been following Zuzana since bodyrock and I love these DVDs. I have lost 45lbs and went from 27% body fat to 23% thanks to Zuzanas workouts. I ordered her strength training DVD and can't wait to start.,1370217600,2,205,4.421052631578948

5527767,4,B00AY5JB92,The workouts are awesome! Very challenging even to someone like me who works out on a regular basis and is in shape. I like the variety and the fact that they are short workouts. The only negatives are the fact that the Ab workouts and stretches are the same on every DVD. I would have expected a different Ab and stretch section on every DVD. Otherwise I love zuzkalight!!! :) you won't be disappointed!,1370131200,,404,4.472972972972973
5527768,4,B00AY5JB92,"ZCUT Power Cardio Series is really cool. She explains all of the exercises very well. The thing I expected when I started the second DVD is a different Warm-up, cool-Down and bonus Abs workout. I just thought that there  would be other warm-ups on each DVD. Despite that, I think these DVD are awesome. And there was also a 1-month-calendar where you can follow a specific program.
I definitely recommend it, because it really helped me doing my workouts more often and on a regular basis! :-)",1370131200,,493,4.666666666666667
5527769,5,B00AY5JB92,"The ZCUT Power Cardio of Zuzana is really the best way to be in shape that I found. The workouts are shorts and give excellent results. Also, it is a very good price to performance ratio as it is less expensive than a gym membership. I would recommand to anyone. Thank you Zuzana for sharing your passion with your Warriorz every day!",1370044800,,334,4.403225806451613
5527770,5,B00AY5JB92,"What I have always loved about Zuzka's video's is that they fee personal and sincere.  The first work-out I watched right away backed that up with Zuzka having a little trouble keeping her balance on one of the exercises but instead of having them re-film to make it look perfect, it was used and makes it look so much more human - even Zuzka can be off for a second and that makes me feel like I don't have to be perfect.

Her work-outs are intense and amazing.  I do wish there were more work-outs that didn't require me jumping since my neighbors below me (I live on the 3rd floor of an apartment) don't appreciate the building shaking, but that isn't an issue with the work-outs, that's an issue with my living situation.

Zuzka is beautiful, fit and just so personable - She doesn't come across as fake as I find a lot of other fitness video's do - and no matter who you are, these work-outs will kick your butt!",1370044800,,917,4.313953488372093

5527773,5,B00AY5JB92,"I'm so glad Zuzka is releasing DVDs now.  I do her ZWOWs all the time, but these are perfect for when I haven't planned my workouts, or the internet is really slow, or I'm traveling and need quick and easily accessible workouts at any time.  Not to mention these are so short and effective - they are intense, but go at your own pace and watch how your times get shorter and shorter as you improve.  Zuzka just has the perfect workout style for me because I hate working out for a long time and the challenge of these are empowering and painfully fun.  She's an inspiration and I'm so thankful for her workouts and motivation!  I'll be a ZWarrior for life.",1369958400,,656,4.344262295081967

5527777,5,B00AY5JB92,"These workouts, led by the lovely and motivating Zuzka, are amazing - short, but super intense.  And they WILL get you results.  I didn't notice a difference too much in my weight - but my INCHES!!!  In only 3 weeks I was loosing substantial inches.... they're amazing.  I'm an addict for life! :)",1369958400,,297,4.547169811320755
5527778,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been a huge fan of Zuzka for years! I follow along with her ZWOWs on youtube and I already did her first Cardio series so I was SUPER excited to get this new Strength series.  First I have to tell you this is very challenging.  If you want someone to kick your butt into shape then you have to try this!  That being said, if you're just starting out with her workouts, it's easy to modify at first with really light weights (or no weights at all!) and quickly build your strength and endurance in order to keep up with her.

Each workout starts with a breakdown of the routine with demonstrations of each exercise so you can easily follow along.  Even if the exercises are new to you or seem too hard at first, Zuzka makes it easy to learn! Some of the exercises I hadn't even heard of before like manmakers and dragon lunge combos. And of course a Z workout wouldn't be complete without her favorite exercise, the dreaded (but effective) BURPEE!

Each of the workouts in this DVD are short but intense, so you can get in a really great workout without wasting a lot of time.  Most of these workouts I can finish in less than 30-minutes. The exercises are exciting and fun to do too, they work so many different muscles in so many different ways even if you're an athlete who works out all the time, you're going to be feeling this the next morning!

One of my favorite things about Zuzka is that she is a real person and she struggles just like the rest of us.  She's is so motivational and it's great to actually workout with someone who is doing the exercises with you instead of just walking around a set telling other people what to do.  Also, I love that it includes a workout calendar because it's easy to stick with the program.  For her last series she did video coaching and according to her facebook she's going to do it again with this series.  She does the daily workouts from the calendar with all of her fans in real time and shares if on youtube for everyone!

I know a lot of people get nervous about using weights but I don't know what everyone is so scared about.  First of all, you don't even have to use weights if you aren't strong enough (yet).  You can even use soup cans or water bottles.  If you're ready for weights but you don't have any, check a local yard sale or goodwill for cheap deals!

To sum it up, this DVD is a must have for anyone who wants to lose weight and get definition.  The program is really effective!",1369958400,40,2453,4.2841648590021695
5527779,5,B00AY5JB92,"I love it a friend of mine recommend it is a totally different way of working out and stay in shape I am  looking forward to do it the workout are awesome and effective !

5527782,5,B00AY5JB92,Zuzka is the most motivational fitness expert I have found. She makes exercise and eating right fun and takes the guesswork out. I am so glad that she has created these dvds they are great! I just ordered the zcut strength series and I know they will be just as great!,1369872000,,268,4.2745098039215685
5527783,5,B00AY5JB92,"I had called a bit before with Zuzka's workouts online, but had never really gotten serious about it. Along comes this 3 dvd set and my life had been changed. I completed this series over 6 weeks ago and I'm still working out hard, pushing myself and still using these dvds. They are useful well past the 12 weeks of the program.
I can honestly say the 1st few workouts were hard for me, but Zuzka is very good at motivating you to keep at it. After the first 4 weeks, things got better and I started noticing I was having an easier time doing some of the exercises and I was really starting to feel better, stronger and I was losing weight and inches. By the final 4 weeks, I had great excitement when I was able to keep up with our surpass her in finishing a timed routine of doing more reps than her. I could tell a difference in myself and so could my family and friends.
One of the things I like most about the series is there is a plan; do this routine on this day. I also likehow there were little tips and motivators on the calendars. She encourages you to keep track of how you are doing: weight, measurements and photos. I also love that she is doing everything you are doing and she wants you to succeed.
I strongly recommend this program to anyone looking to get fit, trim and strong. I really mean it when I say it changed my life.",1369872000,,1344,4.173076923076923

5527785,5,B00AY5JB92,"Zuzka has been doing workouts for years for free on youtube. I am so glad to see her offering something where she can get paid.  I love the videos and felt my legs getting stronger the first week I have used it.  (even though I had to modify a lot of the moves since I'm not in as good of shape as she is.)  Tips for modifying:  keep the moves smaller, use a chair to put your hands on instead of the floor.  If you can't do the pushup part of the burpees just keep getting up and down off the floor and eventually you will be able to do more and more.

These DVD's are worth so much more than the price.

I have not been disappointed and have now gone through the workouts 3 times as well as continuing to use her free ZWOWs that are posted on her YouTube channel and website ZuzkaLight.com!  People tell me how great I look and I can only give credit to Zuzka's training!  My husband has been so impressed by my results he has even started doing the DVDs himself, which he also has found to be effective!  There is no gimmick here, only tough, yet short and simple workouts that are easily worked into any working parents/busy persons day!

5527795,5,B00AY5JB92,"I consider myself a fickle exerciser. I've lost 70+ lbs through running and various DVD programs but I've never seen a single one to the end. I'm usually irritated by the trainer or the smiling goofballs standing in the background. I still have a good chunk of weight to lose and decided to force myself to STICK with something. I'd started Jillian's 30 Day Shred and quit 22 days into it because I was ready to hurl something at the TV. I can't take constant babbling and pseudo threats while working out. Just shut the hell up and let me do my thing, I'm here busting my ass, aren't I? But I digress. I'd seen a few of Zuzka's workouts on YouTube and really liked her but I'm not a fan of working out with YouTube because my internet sucks. Then I found out Zuzka had a DVD program! I ordered that shit and it arrived 3 days later.

I'm starting the second week of month 1 and that uncomfortably tight sweater that's been hanging in closet for months finally fits me and I'm four pounds lighter than when I began the program ONE WEEK AGO. I've also been eating totally clean and drinking water like it's my job. Zuzka's warm and encouraging nature won me over from day one, and it's difficult to become angry with the woman when she's working out and dying right along with you. No joke, her 8 - 15 minute cardio workouts feel like an entire 45 minute Insanity session. The best part? Seeing the sweat drip onto the floor during the cooldown. That always makes me feel awesome.

I love this woman. I love her so much that I just ordered her Yoga DVD and I will be ordering her new ZCUT Power Strength Series when it comes out at the end of the month!",1369440000,,1652,4.291666666666667

My DVDs arrived fast and before I expected them. I started using them the following day. I popped the DVD in and wrote the first workout down, I thought that it didn't seem so bad but then I did the workout and tried to keep pace rep for rep. I got a crazy workout in 10mins! I normally don't follow along with a DVD but having the DVD and her pushing herself and the viewers was extra motivation not to take a breather and push until the end.

I loooove these DVDs! Well worth the money and I am very happy I bought them :)
Only con was that I thought there was 12 workouts per disc but it's 12 workouts in total.

I do wish that she would have had more interval workouts into the program, as most of them are time challenges, but thats because i like to mix it up.

Presentation is everything. Hair, make-up, clothes. Her hair should have been touched up with fresh color and styled, and her clothes should be more professional. I think she is amazing and will go really far in this business, but she has to clean up her act a little. No more major cleavage showing and short shorts. The lighting was a bit poor, I could see a lot of dark bruises on her legs.

Again, I know I'm being picky about the small things, but for her to go all the way, she has to walk the walk a little more.

As for the exercises, I was hoping for things I hadn't seen on You Tube. All of which are extremely tough and are great for a butt-kicking work out, but again, was hoping for some fresh moves.",1368748800,,943,4.114130434782608

I didn't lose a ton of weight, but I definitely lost inches, and toned up quite a bit. My legs looked the best they ever have, even my fiance (now husband) commented on how great they look! The calendar was super easy to follow, and really helped me stay on track.

What I like the most is to have a plan and don't need to think about what routine are you going to follow. The physical aspect of the package is good(recicled paper!!!). Anyhow, for me the deal is in the plan and of course the routines.

The only thing for improvement is that I had to wait a bit since the first time my package was lost somewhere but the customer service was GREAT and really helpful resolving the issue.

I definitly recommend any person who wants to be in shape to buy the Zcut power cardio serie!!! Love mine!!! Now even hubby is joining to the team ;)",1368576000,,965,4.35
5527814,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been following bodyrock and Zuzka on youtube for a while, doing a few workouts here and there, but never really committing. Over the past year bodyrock has turned into a bit of a freakshow, but Zuzka feels like a friend, struggling and out of breath right along with you. For some reason I had a brain-block with her youtube videos, and didn't quite know where to jump in. The DVDs gave me a starting point, and now I include some ZWOWs every week, too. These workouts are no joke!! Recently on vacation, I made my husband do one of them with me. He is in incredible shape as a martial artist, but toward the end he was ready for it to be over!! These workouts can be modified for beginners, and they are not complicated- I don't really even need to play the workouts after one time through (I just pause the screen on the workout breakdown). I feel like a beast when I'm finished- best 15 minutes of my day. Thanks Z!!",1368576000,9,924,4.316091954022989
5527815,5,B00AY5JB92,"HANDY
I love these cardio series. If you have been following Z for a long time like me then you will find some of the moves pretty much the same with what you will find on the videos online. However, these dvd's comes in handy if you are traveling and doesn't have access to internet or for those times when the computer or laptop aren't cooperating well.

HEAT & POSITIVE VIBES
With my own experience from doing the work out, I felt like my whole body is on fire during and after the activity. I can really feel that burning sensation and the plus bonus is, I feel good all through out the day ( I do the work out in the morning), like I have already burned out stress off my body that I am energized to look forward and be able to deal with the crappy reality of work, lol! ;)

LOSE WEIGHT,& MAINTAIN
I would like to address those people who are trying to lose weight and get toned and think that Zuzka's work out alone will help you sculpt up your body in such a short time...you are mistaken. It will take you years to achieve that if you are just going to rely on this type of work out, specially when your body reached plateau where no matter how much work out you do, your body isn't making any changes at all. WARNING: trying to lose weight takes a lot of conscious effort. There will be times when you will actually bounce back to old habits. Most people do, the most important thing is just to never give up. If you are overweight and are getting rid of those excess fats, this work out is really effective for losing those flabs. I was once overweight and I followed her work out religiously everyday and it has drastically made a whole lot difference. But after half a year, I figure that stubborn fats won't simply burn by doing this high intensity short work out alone at a time frame that I have given to myself (which is one year). Aside from good diet, I also have to incorporate weight training to actually tone up and sculpt the muscles. Once you lose fat, you will have parts of your body that looks saggy, and you wouldn't want that. So it really is helpful to do weight training as well. For those who can't afford to go to the gym like me, I just bought basic bench press machine at walmart, some medicine ball, couple sets of barbells and dumbells from garage sales, dip station and chin up bar were just made by the HUBS for me. Other weights used for resistance are items found around the house. Remember, getting in shape isn't about being in the gym with all those fancy equipments and putting on ridiculous pricey outfits (instead of spending money to expensive work out clothing, why not treat yourself by investing money to fancy wardrobe to wear on a date or at work where you can actually show remarkable changes to your body?). It's about being creative with working on what you have at hand and challenging yourself to achieve results within reasonable time frame. In addition to that, I also did some basic YOGA just to give my muscles a good strech as I don't really like to grow tight bulky muscles like that of a man. Also , constant research helps you stay in focus. Having the knowledge and understanding of the effects of good eating habits and exercise to your body is great motivation to stay on track. Going back to Zuzka's work out, they are great for losing weight and for maintaining your physique. Somewhere in between, you have to do extra leg work.

Yes, i would highly recommend it because to be honest, her work out routine are effortlessly CHALLENGING. Why I say that? When you watch her videos, you will find that she is tweaking regular moves to make the experience harder. It may look effortless when she does it, but when you are actually doing it, you will feel all different muscles in your body reacting and yes, do say ""HELLO SORENESS"" after;)",1368576000,3,3805,4.394326241134752
5527816,5,B00AY5JB92,"There have been many studies that prove that High Intensity Interval Training is the most effective form of exercise for fat loss and maintaining (or even gaining) muscle. There are also many health benefits that come with this kind of training that do not come with normal exercise. It's a really great idea to get informed about this kind of training because it will change the way you look at exercising for fat loss forever. Especially when all you need to do is a minimum of 10 minutes a day which is a big plus in our busy lives.

Zuzka Light has created these excellent DVDs which will guide you to doing the most kick-ass exercises you will ever do and all it requires is YOU (as well as some optional minor pieces of optional equipment like dumbbells and a chair). The great thing about Zuzka's exercises is that you can do them anywhere in the world. I travel a lot and I have always managed to do her exercises in my hotel room - even the tiniest of hotel rooms. The DVDs have also been great to take with me when the internet isn't so readily available in hotels. They're small enough that they can fit in any bag. There are no excuses not to!

The DVDs are easy to follow and explain the exercises before beginning. If you're familiar with Zuzka's youtube channel and website, you will know her style. I keep coming back because I love the fact that she actually does the exercises and I love seeing that they're not easy for HER. They MUST be good, then! In saying that, if you're a beginner, do not be afraid to start with her workouts. She offers modifications but you can also make up your own modifications if you maintain the proper form (back straight, no slouching, abs tight etc).

The exercises on the DVD are no different to what is on her website. So why buy her DVD? Before I discovered Zuzka's workouts, I was slaving away at the gym for an hour a day. I couldn't lose the weight. My physique never changed. I thought I was eating right and working out well. It wasn't until I found her on BodyRock that my life completely changed. I started doing her workouts, I started finding out more about nutrition. The result after even 12 days straight of two ZWOWs/ZCUTs a day has been remarkable. I have abs. I am the fittest I have ever been. I have even been able to stand up from my desk without having to push myself up from the chair. I can play with my kids for as long as I want and I don't struggle getting up from the floor. I used to be clumsy and unsure of myself. With each workout, I am sharper than ever. So I buy these DVDs to support Zuzka. I would by 10 million of them if I could. The lady deserves all the success in the world for what she has done for so many people.

For the price, it is definitely worth buying this DVD. You will never need to buy another exercise DVD!",1368489600,4,2813,4.2819548872180455
5527817,5,B00AY5JB92,"This is day 7 and I'm loving it!! I always wanted to get into amazing shape but was never consistent with my workouts. My workouts would take roughly an hour and a half to complete. I work 12 hour days and sometimes I was simply too tired to follow through. One night I tried Zuzka's ""300 Rep Real Time Workout"" on YouTube before bed. I thought, ""I can do this short workout and at least I'll have done something and then tomorrow I can get back on track with my program."" I had never felt like that after a workout, that short workout kicked my a**. So, longer workouts did not necessarily equal more effective! I was hooked. Never again would I feel too tired to complete my workout. I would just tell myself, ""Hey, you can stick it out for 15 minutes!"" Everyone has 15 minutes to spare for their health. I bought these DVD's and have been following the program religiously. I also began incorporating Zuzka's diet tips and have totally changed my diet. While I'm not in it for the weight loss, more so for muscle tone and fitness, I do monitor my weight and so far I've lost 4.5 pounds.

5527821,4,B00AY5JB92,"I enjoy the workouts and they definitely offer great intensity in the short time period; BUT I was really disappointed that one of the DVDs started skipping from the first time I played it, so must have been faulty. I also found after trying to follow the 30 day routine that by day 15 or so my joints were in a fair amount of pain. I've since eased up on the number of days in a row I will use these routines to work out. I might be able to stick with it more regularly once my strength/form improves.

So far I am really liking the short time it takes me to complete my workout.
I will be looking forward to the end result!
Zuzka is easy to follow and shows that it is hard even for her, nice to see that she is human.
I will rewrite my review after I'm done the 30 days
It is nice to find something challenging instead of being disappointed and the video not being challenging enough.
Okay, I am now finished the 30 day ZCUT Power Cardio DVD's.
I liked the short duration of the workouts, this is what kept me motivated, it did not take me long and I was sweaty every time.
I found the warm up to be not quite enough for me especially with all the jumping in the workouts, so I doubled what the warm up reps were for each exercise, went faster and added light weights to some of the exercises.  This worked much better for me.
I also did either the bonus abs or my own core workout every second workout.
I noticed changes in my body and will continue to use these workouts as my home exercise base on top of what I already do.
I also liked that I could complete these workouts in a very small space and did not need any extra workout equipment!
Thank you Zuzka!!!! You will hear from me again!",1368144000,3,1235,4.103305785123967

5527830,5,B00AY5JB92,"Although I had seen Zuzka work out on youtube before, I didn't work out with her or follow her routines, so I'm really new to the program. The DVD shipped super fast and arrived almost a week earlier than I expected it. I have just done the first 3 workouts but I have looked at the rest. The workouts are challenging but not impossible. I had to pause the dvd a couple of times on the first workout to catch my breath, but I am very out of shape. The lack of music does not bother me. The workouts are fairly short and go by pretty fast. That said, they are complete workouts that you will definitely feel the next day.
I love that Zuzka is doing the workout too and panting right along with me. I also like the way she encourages the viewer to ""push"" and to ""keep going,"" rather than screaming like some fitness instructors do. I anticipate sticking with this program for a very long time. I look forward to working out instead of dreading it.",1368144000,,945,4.2555555555555555

I knew that she needed a good role model and not just that also a good workout that felt unlike any other. Zuska provides just that; a workout that leaves you gasping for breath and if you can keep up with her without taking a break then you are truly a warrior.

Seriously, this DVD set just couldn't get any better. Unless, the price tag was less than $20!!!!!!! For anyone looking for an amazing and results driven workout...this is it!

I do like that it feels like she is a friend showing me how to do an exercise. She seems very sweet and tough all in one. I don't love that I have to wait or fast forward to get to the next workout, but then again, that is all dvd's. It's not very clear if I should do all 4 workouts or just one or 2. I am not sure how I can master all of the workouts and not have to wait. I wish I knew which ones offered more arms and more legs....it's all a matter of me trying to figure it out. All in all, I am glad I have the dvd's if I can even look a 3rd of what Zuzka looks like. She is an inspiration and I am hoping to master half of what she knows and it will be enough. Great that she has so many moves and it does not get boring. I am an ultra marathoner and I win races and this even kicks my butt.

 I even ordered the yoga workouts ... also fantastic",1367280000,,186,4.8125
5527859,4,B00AY5JB92,"I knew her trough her youtube workouts.bought this Collection and until now never regret it. Only thing why i wouldn't rate 5 stars,is the fact that the DVD wrapping could be more enhanced.",1367280000,,189,4.757575757575758
5527860,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been a fan of Zuzka for a couple of years now.  I've always found her approach to give great results and was thrilled with this opportunity to show my support.  I love the DVD format and the workouts are obviously more cardio based than her other ZWOWs on youtube.  I would recommend it for anyone, especially if you are short on time!  I love the short intense cardio workouts!!",1367193600,,384,4.442857142857143
5527861,5,B00AY5JB92,"Couldn't be happier that we purchased Zuzana's DVD's! My husband introduced me to Zuzana's workouts online when I decided to finally get healthy, and I'm so grateful that he did!  Here I was, 31 years old and at least 125lbs overweight. Ridiculous, I needed a change.  I had always been active growing up, played sports, but had always struggled with my weight. As I went through my 20's my weight slowly crept up, and I finally decided to do something about it!

I didn't know where to start, other than eating healthy, and that's where Zuzana came in and saved the day! I needed a combination of cardio and strength training, and her workouts are perfect!  My husband used to be a personal trainer, so her workouts were easier for him, but I decided not to get in my own way with excuses, started slow, and modified each exercise as I went along. The great thing about Zuzana's workouts, is that they are great for all skill levels, you just have to adapt her workouts to your current fitness.  In the beginning, I was modifying every exercise, and now can do almost all of the exercises as she does them!  It is an amazing feeling to accomplish one of her workouts when you couldn't dream of it before!

Zuzana is a great ""virtual coach"", as she doesn't use any hype or gimmicks in her workouts, just plain 'ole fashioned hard work!  She is very motivating and I am so grateful that she finally made DVD's!  I will buy every DVD that she releases, as her workouts are extremely effective, and I couldn't ask for better results!  I am now down over 100lbs, and have never felt this great in my life!

Thanks so much, Zuzana- You are an inspiration!!!!",1367193600,,1653,4.494983277591973
5527862,5,B00AY5JB92,"If you want to get in the best shape of your life, then this DVD set will certainly get you there. These work outs are short, but intense. You will truly feel different after just one week of committed training. keep going for the whole program as directed and you will not be disappointed. Nutrition and diet tips included. You will NOT be bored with this work-out routine. Consistency and proper supportive diet will yield the best results. these workouts are meant to be done almost daily, but they are short enough that there is really no excuse as to why you can't fit one into your day.

And a fantastic price I don't mind the basic packaging because I don't want to pay through the nose for glam and gloss its the content im interested in and the content is great.

Than I was so glad when I found her again on Facebook and started to follow her workouts on You tube.  When she released her videos I was so excited and bought them right away. The first week I did her workouts I was so sore it was not even funny. But I loved it, I feel empowered when I do her workouts. I love her technique and just with 15 minutes of working out I end up drenched in sweat. I recommend her workout DVDs you will not regret getting them money well spent",1366848000,,555,4.0

They are SO challenging (and I thought I was in pretty good shape!), but she is encouraging through the whole series. The breakdowns of each move are really descriptive and easy to follow and the workout to follow is KILLER! If you want a beach body in no time this is THE SERIES. I've done everything from P90X to Insanity and nothing comes close (nothing against the beach body folks at all! I have just finally found what works for ME personally).

I also am just blown away by the price for this incredible series. I encourage YOU to purchase this series and for Zuzana to please make more more MORE!",1366848000,,751,4.481751824817518

The ZCUT is similar to her you tube videos; however, I like that I can now do her workouts when I don't have internet connection on the go.  The videos will get your heart rate up, will strengthen you, will tighten and tone those trouble area, and make you that lean machine!!

5527880,5,B00AY5JB92,Zuzka has put together 12 short but dynamic workouts.  What I love about it is that it's easy to stick to.  How many times have we given up on workouts because they are either too long or not enough workouts causing them to be repetative.  With 12 workouts you won't be bored.  I am on month three and I'm still with it.  My legs no longer jiggle when I walk and I have more muscle difinition in my arms.  More importantly I have built up my indurance. I have gone from having to pause to DVD after two minutes to completing the whole workout and keeping up with Zuzka.  I would love for her to put out another set like this. Worth the money.,1366761600,,642,4.129032258064516

Not that I am a person that is out of shape by any means... due to the fact that I frequent the gym..., but Zuzka's training heavily targets all the spots and aspects that weightlifting and running alone does not!  Maybe difficult to believe..., nevertheless still true!  My strong but humble suggestion is to partake in Zuzka's intense and very fulfilling training Zcut cardio...1 hours worth of a workout in 10-15 min... Increased energy... Heightened mindset and focus..  Amazon delivered it within the same week I bought it so I was able to begin Zcut within a very short time of me ordering it.  Zuzka is a pure Goddess.., and as silly as it may sound..., should I pass at any time, the only thing that I want to be inscribed on my tombstone is ""Here lies one of Zuzka's Zwarriors who lived an outstanding healthy life""!

5527883,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have followed Zuzana from back when she was doing Bodyrock. I have been a distance runner for 10 plus years which is great for maintaining a thin physique but have only ever gotten the muscle tone definition doing her Hiit workouts. I always loved that she used bodyweight or minimum weights and gadgets.  The fact that you didn't have to go out and buy a whole gym was attractive to my budget!

So I was thrilled when she started her own ZuskaLight website. I was curious about this DVD set, but waited a few months to read the reviews. I dont' know why I waited. These are fantastic and challenging. But you don't have to spend hours in the gym. With the warm up, workout and cool down I think I was probably done in about 30-45 minutes.

These will be a fantastic supplement to my running and I can't wait to do the rest of the workouts.",1366675200,,842,4.283018867924528

5527885,5,B00AY5JB92,"I had a baby 2 years ago, I did fityummymummy to get the bulk of the weight off. I have been trying everything to get those last 10-15 pounds off. I wasn't sure if it was just loose skin. I tried p90x and some other big name programs with no success at all, I was actually getting bigger on those programs. I have been using Zuzka's zwow's online for a week and a half (although I cannot finish them) and have been following her eating patterns to a T and the weight is coming off. My husband commented several times that he can see defintion on the sides of my abs. Truthfully, I think this has more to do with the eating, so for that I recommend you go to zuzka's free youtube videos on how she eats. The eating is boring, but it works. Something I did not expect doing this program is how comfortable I feel with Zuzka. She feels like a supportive friend I have known my whole life. Watch the youtube videos, soon she will be your friend too, pushing you along. I'm not rating the video on music, warmups, or asthetics as some others have been, because the bottem line is, they videos work. 2 weeks in and I am getting a 6 pack I couldn't get for 2 years of effort, and I am not even completing the workouts b/c I can hardly keep up. I just do my very best and try again the next day and I am still seeing these kinds of results. Don't believe me? Try her free videos on youtube and see for yourself. I am going to buy the zuzka yoga video for some variety.

5527890,5,B00AY5JB92,"Zuzka has helped me realize I don't need to spend an hour in the gym everyday to stay lean, fit and in shape. I've gone from doing bootcamp-type classes 3 days a week where I'm flogging myself to death to keeping my workouts to 30 minutes or less...and my body hasn't changed.  These DVDs are fantastic.  Most workouts are 10-15 mins long but if you add in the warm-up, cool-down and even the bonus ab if you want it'll extend your workout to approx 30 minutes.  Sometimes I'll do some weights and use one of the workouts as a ""finisher,"" sometimes I'll do a Zuzka WOW and one of these and sometimes just one of her ZCuts.  I'll admit I previewed some of the workouts thinking, ""Ok this'll be my easy day"" and quickly discovered it was tougher than it appeared.

Just another reason why I so love Zuzka and appreciate all that she does.",1366502400,,836,4.367741935483871

5527892,5,B00AY5JB92,I do not have much time to workout and find it a challenge to find quick intense workouts.  This is exactly what I need.  I only got through the first DVD so far but I am impress that the 4 workouts all have a different format and gets my heart rate up.  I really think my heart rate is higher with this workout then the 20 min fast and furious by Shaun T and I love the insanity workouts.  Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a challenge!,1366416000,,448,4.0
5527893,5,B00AY5JB92,I am very happy with these DVDs. All the workouts are between 10 -15 minutes (not including the warm up and cool down) which is exactly what I need as I don't have much time. I would say that the majority of the workouts are focused on legs so you will definitely see change there. I do my own warm up but I like the cool down as Zuzka is using very good moves there (not the ones that you usually see on every other workout DVD). I would definitely recommend these DVDs to anyone who wants to see a change in their body and wants to get there fast.,1366416000,,549,4.0

5527895,5,B00AY5JB92,"I'll start saying that I love this woman... It's just hard not to. But that aside, this program is challenging, fun, and effective.
I have to be honest about my diet, we all know that the kitchen is a HUGE part of fitness but, although I was not super strict I was still paying attention to it 90% of the time.

Today, I am 4 workouts away from finishing my 90 days and my arms, thighs and butt look WAY, WAY, WAAAAAAAAY better than they did 3 months ago.

I still get sore, I still sweat like crazy 2 minutes into the workouts and I still find them challenging. But my agility, flexibility, endurance and my times have improved noticeably.

These DVDs are a keeper. Although the scale doesn't show a huge difference, my mirror, clothes and pictures do! I believe it's because even though I have lost fat I have also gained lean muscle (which is heavier than fat).

**Too Long Didn't Read:
Even after almost 90 days I still love the program, it makes me sore and it is still super challenging and fun.
Yes, it will change your body. Yes, it will improve your endurance noticeably. Yes, IT WORKS.

5527896,3,B00AY5JB92,"I was expecting a real structured plan to follow, more challenging, longer workouts, new moves... something different from Zwows, but it turned out to be just more from the same.
I love Zuzkas workouts and I do them on regular basis, that is the reason I bougth these DVD's, because I was expecting her best moves and best workout plan, as she says in the commercial.
I don't like the fact that almost all workouts are just 10 min long! almost all of them!  Same old moves, same structure and style as Zwows.
About the DVD quality, it is not very good, they don't play very smoothly, but image is good quality.
Anyway, I have to say the workouts are hard and good. They make you sweat like crazy, and now I have a bigger Zwows collection!
I like the warm up, cool down and ab bonus.",1366243200,,782,4.319727891156463
5527897,5,B00AY5JB92,Shipping is quick and the DVDs are awesome.  My friend recommended her and I started to follow her on YouTube.  Her workouts are perfect for a busy life and someone who will not do plyos at the gym.  Best of luck to her. She is super motivating :),1366243200,,247,4.104166666666667
5527898,5,B00AY5JB92,"The ZCUT workouts are perfect for loosing weight and/or just shaping up. They are brief 10 to 15 mins max, which allows me no excuses to jump the daily gym session even when I am super busy (I work full time and study part time). I have been doing those workouts for 10 days now and I can see already results.
The workouts are also good fun and Zuzana is a very nice and funny trainer that know how to involve you into serious training. There are no boring classic gym exercises and each workout is different from the previous one which allows improving coordination and strenght. Really great product, I would definitely recomment it!",1366243200,,635,4.530434782608696
5527899,5,B00AY5JB92,"First of all, I have been following Z since back in her bodyrock days. I read many of the reviews before ordering the DVD's, so I somewhat knew what to expect. I disagree with everyone who says these are just like her youtube workouts. While I agree that you can find most, if not all of these exercises in her various youtube videos, there is an undeniable cardio focus in these workouts.

These workouts totally kick my ass! My boyfriend is a huge fitness buff, and when the DVD's came in the mail we watched the first exercise together. He said it looked really ""light"", probably because of the short time, and the fact that he is used to lifting weights. He suggested I do multiple workouts together to get a ""real"" workout. So, I challenged him to walk the talk! We have been doing one together every day, and at the end we are both completely drained and sweaty! Funny, he never seems to want to do a couple more after, when I ask him if we should try to get a ""real"" workout. We do sometimes go do some weight training a bit later.

All in all, I am very happy with the quality of the DVDs and the workouts. I have heard some people saying theirs don't play, but mine have been great. I have also heard a lot of complaints about shipping taking forever. I ordered them the night of April 3, and was told to expect the order sometime in mid May to June. I got them April 12, so I was pretty damn impressed!

I can't wait until Zuzanna starts shipping her yoga series to Canada!",1366243200,,1483,4.25177304964539
5527900,5,B00AY5JB92,I like the workouts as Zuzka clearly explains her exercises and any person starting can follow the program .She is not only clear in her explanations but so encouraging. Yes the exercises are challenging but as Zuzka does it with you its like having your own personal trainer. All you need to do is focus on her and try to push yourself to your own limits. The DVDs comes with a 30 day chart and a person can track your own progress whether you just want to get fit or strong or lose weight. This really empowers oneself and instill self discipline to exercise daily. It is short workouts and can be slotted into any busy schedule. Each dvd starts with a warm up and ends with a cool down for the workouts and a bonus AB section is also included and what is so nice you can do the workouts anywhere.,1366243200,,799,4.2631578947368425

I found #2 & #9 to be the toughest for me but they are all fantastic.  I didn't think 10 - 15 minutes of exercising would be enough.  I usually do 30 minutes.  But they have been and I'm already feeling leaner and my legs and butt have been sore after several sessions.  I haven't felt that in a long time with other workouts.

I enjoy these workouts so much I've ordered her Yoga dvd.  Thanks Z!",1366070400,,514,4.28125

I do the the workouts as they are in the calender but on skinny tip days I do the Abs Bonus workout and also the newest ZWOW.

I can't wait that day when they start to ship the Yoga DVD to Europe..",1366070400,,369,3.9864864864864864

5527907,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am completely IN LOVE with this 3-disc at home workout series. Unlike those motivated individuals who pay for a gym membership and have the discipline to get in their cars and drive to workout, I have to admit that sometimes setting up to workout in my living room is a chore. I have completed other in-home workout series, including Insanity and P90X, and ZCUT Power Cardio Series is nothing short of FABULOUS! The workouts are short and INTENSE! I always feel like I am dying to catch my breath following each segment. If you are familiar with Zuzka, then you know that you are getting more than your money's worth in return. If you haven't had the pleasure of sweating to one of her workouts, then seriously...what are you waiting for?! BUY THIS SERIES NOW!!!",1365984000,,764,4.625
5527908,4,B00AY5JB92,"You go Zuzka! As many people who purchased this, I have been following Zuzana Light since her, ahem, old website. I'm so proud of her for making it to the workout DVD line!
These workouts are intense! I did the second one today and even though it lasted under 15 minutes I was dripping sweat!
For people out there who don't know Zuzka and aren't familiar with her style of workouts, they are short and intense! Why spend hours in the gym when you can knockout your workout in less than 15 minutes?
There are three discs, and the first disc comes with a calendar (you can download the other two at her website zuzkalight.com) and for each day on the calendar you have one workout. Some days you will have a rest day. On each DVD there is a warm up, the Warrior Workouts, and the cool down. There is also a bonus abs workout if you want to go the extra step! This is how the first one is anyway, I haven't made it to the other three. The workouts usually go something like 10 squat jumps, 30 burpees, etc.. and she goes over what each exercise is to look like before the actual workout begins.
I only took away one point because as big of a fan as I am of Zuz's, I really wanted some music in the background. It's awfully quiet! Also, for me personally, I really don't want to do 60 of a two step exercise, simply because I start to get bored. Variation is very important to me... maybe if it was broken down in between the other exercises like in #1 with the 50 burpees.
Other than that, GREAT DVD! Easy, quick, and you WILL SWEAT!",1365984000,,1530,4.207482993197279
5527909,4,B00AY5JB92,"I saw some reviewers feel that these are workouts you can pretty much get for free on Zuzka's website. I agree. But Zuzanna provides so much great free content. I mainly bought the DVDs because a) Zuzanna's workouts kick serious ass, b) as a thank you for so many free workouts over the years. Oh and I really like the calendar and ""plan"" aspect of the DVDs too :)",1365984000,,364,4.2898550724637685

To be honest: they are really short but to do these workouts almost every day challenge me a little bit. BUT I like the way it hurts!!!!! :-)

In summary I can say: I love the fact that I don't have to think about which workout I should do. I love the workout plan and it is such a motivation to follow Zuzana with her post on the daily basis.
The dvd is also a great mixture to the ZWOW.

Can't wait until the yoga dvd is available in Europe!

Thank's to Zuzana for such a great Dvd Set with such a cheap price!
Also love that they are going green.

The workouts tend to be 10-15 minutes, but in reality unless you are in tip top shape it will take you about 30 minutes until you build up the stamina to keep up. It is totally worth the purchase!! We typically paused the video a few times to keep up becuase she is in AMAZING shape.  We now do not have to pause the videos.  I have recommended to all my friends, guys and girls.  This DVD is not just for women, my boyfriend loves Zuzka and she's not bad to look at. She definitely keeps you motivated. Buy them!",1365984000,,555,4.12037037037037

I had never done high intensity interval training before and the first workouts really kicked my butt, but I have grown to love doing the workouts because the results are fast and visible, almost unbelievable. Make sure you support all your hard work with a clean diet. I was looking to shred fat, so I took Zuzsana's advice and only ate my daily intake of carbs as part of a post workout meal, usually in the form of oatmeal. It's important to know that whole grains are necessary in any diet, they are fuel for muscles and shouldn't be cut out completely. I also suggest following her on her YouTube account and blog (ZuzkaLight) for supplementary information like recipe tips and motivation. At the end of the three month schedule of working out everyday, I lost a total of 2 inches (I am 5'3"" and weighed in at 115 lbs, I'm now down to 110 lbs). You will feel strong, and so proud of yourself after the program.",1365984000,,1045,4.5638297872340425

Since using the DVDs, however, I have had much faster and much better results and am WAY happier overall with how far I have come. I definitely recommend these workouts - as well as Zuzana's other ZWOWs - to anyone who is crunched for time, but loves working out or getting a good sweat in.

To those interested - buy them! And to those still using ZWOW's on a regular basis - to compliment the DVDs, or in place of them until yours arrive ;) - I use the +Z Workout Companion App for Android which has been a HUGE lifesaver for when I'm away from home, or simply as a way to keep track of my workouts and keep them logged and well organized.",1365811200,,814,4.251612903225807

I was skeptical when I ordered this as there were already reviews before they could have humanly been able to get the discs let alone try them out.  Those reviews aside, I was glad for the purchase.  I have almost every imaginable Beachbody workout set that you can own, and they are pricey.  I was amazed at how inexpensive these discs were in comparison.  I find them to be a good addition to my collection.  These workouts are quick and easy to put into my morning when I don't have a lot of time.  She's working out with you, which is nice that she doesn't do a couple and then walk around a bunch of people pointing out what they are doing.  I do wish that there was a three month calendar instead of one.  You can download the other months online, but it's not the same.  The shipping on these was ridiculous, but I understand that they had a lot of orders all at once, but it was still a bit lengthy for even that.  I am not going to move down a star on that though, because the 5 stars is for the dvd's.  This was definitely worth the buy and I recommend them.",1365638400,,1210,4.115384615384615

Now, I decided to buy these DVDs and try doing her new program.
---

Workouts continues from 10 to 16 minutes. Plus 5-7 minute for warm-up on start and cool down in the end. That is, on the whole, it takes up 20-25 minutes of your time. They do not require any additional equipment, all you need - only your own body.

Workouts are different in composition  - some for the time, some are interval. Set of exercises is not repeated, but in different workouts can meet the same exercise.

Before each training there is a detailed description of exercises for each workout.  Workouts are very dynamic, you shall do them in a fast pace.

After two weeks, that I doing this program, I can say these workout are excellent for doing on an empty stomach before breakfast, they are short and not weigth. With these workouts I get a charge of vivacity every morning and feeling myself perfect all day! I'm getting really stronger and thinning.

This complex is good for fat loss, after you got already some muscle mass and strength. All exercises are designed for saving muscle and body-weight. Also this program is very good for those people who want to lose weight, but does not want a big muscles.

Before beach season it is a great training program!",1365638400,,1303,4.586206896551724

love the warm-up and cool down sessions which you don't get with the zwows! and love love LOVE the fact that Zuzka doesn't try to make you buy weights or interval timers or whatever else we don't need!!!

Zuzka explains very well, so you don't need to be glued to the screen, you can just listen to her (useful when you're lying on your tummy!!)

Unlike a lot of reviewers, I never did Body Rock. I knew of it but because I didn't have the equipment needed, I was never able to follow the excercise. I knew of the youtube workouts but I wanted to have the whole plan set for me and take out the time of searching for the excercises without equipment.

You will DEFINITELY be warmed up. The cool down is a nice lead into your own stretches. Stretching is a MUST. Zuzka herself even tells you this. Make sure to do the warm up. You don't want to just jump in to these workouts without it. You will sweat, you will work hard, but you will see results. After day 1 I'm feeling fantastic! Everything feels tighter, stronger. I cannot wait until day 30 when I can visually see the changes that my body has undergone. I definitely recommend! Give it a shot! It is so affordable, what do you have to lose? Give it your all and if you can't keep up pause it! Catch your breath and keep on moving!

Bottom line: Affordable, Worth it, GREAT.

Lastly, I got my DVDs within 2 days. Not expedited shipping, just regular. SO HAPPY with the shipping and arrival :)

Please keep in mind, when reading my updates, that I do use a calorie restricted diet. I don't exclude any foods or food groups but I limit the amount of calories I intake daily because I am dieting. The ZCUT program has really kick started my dieting though! I'm having GREAT results!

Update 4/7/2013: I have lost .5 inches in my arms, waist, and thighs. IN ONE WEEK! No weight loss yet but I think that is because of water retention and muscle gain.
Update 4/14/2013: I have lost another .5 inches in my waist. No change in other measurements and I lost 2 lbs this week! AFTER ONLY TWO WEEKS OF THE ZCUT PROGRAM!",1365292800,,1578,4.2675585284280935

The workouts are between 8 - 15 minutes but they are adjustable because you are trying to beat your own time.  Each workout comes with a breakdown, which I write out on a piece of paper so in case I'm ahead or behind Zuzka's time I have a reference.  Also, this means I don't have to put in the DVD if I can't.

I have been working out consistantly for about 6 years now and I have to say these are probably my favorite workouts - ZCUT and ZWOW's (found on YouTube and Zuzka's website).  I don't like to spend a lot of time working out - I prefer high intensity workouts that are short and effective.  That's what these workouts are for me!  I don't need to schedule an hour of gym time; I can come home from work pop in a DVD (or lookup a ZWOW) and be done in 15 minutes.

5527941,5,B00AY5JB92,"Zuzka, I really love what you do and how you do it. Positive, inspiring. These workouts are an EXCELLENT, unbeatable value. Sometimes I find youtube distracting. This way I just put it in & get it DONE.

I have a full library of workout DVDs. I'm not afraid of hard workouts but sometimes I just wasn't motivated to do them. Here's why Zuzka's are easier for me to do:

#1 - She's a girl with a great body, so whatever she's doing, I'm in. I can commit, because if she does these & it works, it's at least in the right direction. A lot of trainers have bodies that aren't what I want...they're either men or look overly bulky or muscular. Men know about training men, but it takes a girl to really know the truth of how a girl's body changes & works. Even for P90X, they're in great shape and it's great to be strong but...that's not what you typically see in movie star bodies. Movie stars do everything to look very lean, not bulky or overly muscular.

#2 - She just gets it done. So the time doesn't feel overwhelming at all. Instead of feeling like I'm going to lose an hour, it's quick...and then you'll be inspired to keep going and do more. You don't need to, but after intense exercise is a good time to do any steady-state like jump rope.

#3 - She has really great form, and she's doing it with you. All of her workouts require very little equipment. It's just really about your body and that's IT.

#4 - The fitness industry is like anything else, money-driven. And sometimes they'll sell you expensive stuff that you really don't need. These workouts just cut the BS and GET IT DONE.

I ordered directly from her site because I know Amazon takes almost all of the money, and I guarantee you at this price there's way too little profit already for the work she's put in. Support her!  This girl has already put out a TON of excellent, free, inspiring content and these workouts are just a notch up from those. Plus you get a warm up and cool-down that's probably different from what you're already doing.",1365033600,,2015,4.371657754010696
5527942,5,B00AY5JB92,"I love these mini workouts.  They are perfect to add on to a strength workout or a less demanding cardio workout.  They are also nice timesavers.  It's also great that the only piece of equipment she uses is a chair.

Right before each workout, there is a tutorial segment, which is very helpful.  Zuzka goes through each exercise to show you correct form.  These are not easy exercises.  She does a lot of burpees and offers a new spin on them, eg., 3 point burpees, side burpees, etc.  She offers a few modifications, but not a lot.

There is no music to this video.  Sometimes her counting each rep gets a little annoying and I noticed that sometimes she cheats a little when she counts, but the workouts are short and effective.

Zuzka takes some little breaks between each set, but I found that since my fitness level is high, I didn't need to most of the time.  You can also perform her moves faster than she does with more reps.  Of course, you can always pace yourself along with her or go slower.

For the interval and tabata junkie like I am--they are great.",1364947200,,1068,4.410256410256411
5527943,5,B00AY5JB92,"As always Zuzka makes us sweat and challenges us to push hard to make changes in our body. On her youtube channell she goes through the program step by step and shares nutrition suggestions and other important fitness information.

The DVD delivers and is a true value ESPECIALLY at this price. Others charge soooo much more. This is true value that delivers. Only wish the second and third calenders where already printed, but for the price I can afford to make a nice copy elsewhere.

You don't need anything but a small space and your deternination to make this program work.

I was saddened to not have new workouts led by Zuzka.  I stayed subscribed to that channel until one day, Zuzka popped back up again & I have abandoned the old channel for the original!  If you're familiar with hiit or tabata training and want short explosive workouts that include plyometrics and cardio then these DVD's are the way to go, as well as her channel!  Do not be fooled by the simplicity of these exercises, they work and will leave you in the same condition as if you worked out for an hour at a gym.  The home movement is the way to go with minimal equipment & results!  Get these DVD's and support a person who for years has been giving free services to thousands of viewers.  The DVD's are priced very affordably.  So, why buy these DVD's when you can watch her for free?  Because you are supporting her & what she does and has done for those of us in the know (at home workouts with results).  You won't regret it.",1364947200,,1085,4.348258706467662
5527945,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have been following Zuzka for over 2 years, and was so excited when she put out a dvd series. I, of course, had to buy it to show my support...since she has been providing me with free workouts for the last two years. I love her workouts, they are short and effective, and she is so much fun to work out with!",1364860800,,311,3.9523809523809526
5527946,5,B00AY5JB92,"Super fast shipping! I like this type of training because it's funny, dynamic, saves you a lot of time and you don't need any expensive equipment because you mostly just use your own body weight. I discovered Zuzana back in 2010 when in bodyrock and this dvd set is what I've always wanted. Love the workouts, I combine them with gym. I do them when I don't have much time. They're challenging and combined with a clean diet, they really work. You do feel you're pushing it to the limit. After not much time working out this way, I've developed more strength than ever.  I like that warm up and cool down are included in every disc, so you don't have to be changing discs. I really look forward to see the results after doing the entire program!",1364860800,,745,4.398550724637682
5527947,4,B00AY5JB92,"I ordered the ZCut about 3 weeks ago and do them in the morning before work.  I like the short time limit and the exercises that are given.  I've noticed a difference in my body just from using my own bodyweight.  I like how not a lot of equipment is used.  I also like how the warmup/cooldown and ab blaster exercises are on every DVD so you don't have to switch back to one.  I already have them memorized.
I recommend this to anyone.  You can go at your own pace and she is just a normal person huffing and puffing like the rest of us while we workout.
Very good.",1364774400,,566,4.054054054054054

5527951,5,B00AY5JB92,"I use these, and Zuzka's YouTube videos, to supplement my running. Since the exercises are mostly bodyweight resistance for time I find they are conducive to helping crosstrain legs and improve cardio performance. The workouts a very compact, effective, and short enough to tack onto a mid-distance day or to do on a day when there isn't much time for anything else. If you're truly pushing yourself to the max, you will get something out of these workouts.",1364688000,,457,4.871794871794871

5527955,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am super happy with this dvd series for many reasons. The first is it is affordable, it is incredibly hard to get good quality exercise gear/products/help that is affordable. The second reason is that these are all body weight workouts, there is no special gear or gym needed. This is great because I can workout wherever and when ever I want and not have to pay an arm and a leg for a bunch of gear that takes up space that I only use once. I also like this workout series because it really is designed for max effort. Even if you struggle to keep up with Zuzana improvements come very fast. I have no regrets, this product is affordable, useful and worth every penny. My one caution is it is an intense program, so I would encourage beginners to keep in touch with Zuzka's website for modifications if the dvd series is challenging.",1364515200,,836,4.4

5527959,5,B00AY5JB92,"The DVDs arrived well ahead of the expected date and were trackable right up until they cleared customs.  There isn't much I can say other than to second many of the other 5 star reviews in terms of the content.  ZCUT is classic Zuzka with a heaping side of cardio.  I have been using her You Tube stuff for almost a year to offset my running habit, however, living in Canada there are 6 months of the year where your only option is run in some really cold weather (and probably in the dark) or hit the treadmill. Personally, I HATE the treadmill, so in the last three months I have probably averaged one run every two weeks.  It's spring now and I am running outside and finding I lost very little of the gains I made last summer after working how at home with Zuzka's stuff 5 days a week.  If you are short on time - and who isn't - Zuzka's workouts are fantastic and they crank out the results in as little as 10 minutes day.  I am looking forward to her next release, Power Yoga!",1364342400,,983,4.174603174603175

5527964,5,B00AY5JB92,"Hello Everyone,

I have been Following Zuzka for 4 years on and off.  I always start seeing results and find myself making excuses as to why I cannot continue working out.  When she finally told us she was putting out her own DVD set I knew that I had to get it.  Last time I did a program by her I saw great results in just 6 weeks.  So for just $20 I knew I had to show her support and get back into shape and stay there.  So far I am into my third week and while I do not see physical change I can feel it.  I feel better, I want to eat healthier, and I can feel the tightening happen a little bit.  I absolutely love Zuzka's workouts and her.  She is a great trainer and motivator. The workouts are not long at all; the longest it took me was day 2 I kept taking breaks and ended up finishing at around 20 minutes.  Had I really pushed through, it would have been way faster.  If you are unsure about making this purchase all I have to say is...What do you have to lose other than body fat?

5527965,5,B00AY5JB92,I love her workouts! They are short and very effective (with proper diet)! I am on my 4th week and am already beating my times from the first couple weeks! I can definitely see and feel the difference in my body. Zuzka rocks!!!!,1364169600,,228,4.325581395348837

5527967,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have been a Personal Trainer and Group Fitness instructor for over three years. While I'm able to design effective, non-boring workouts for my clients, I tend to neglect my personal workout routines. I've been following Zuzana for a while and doing her workouts from time to time but never committed to them 100%. I decided I needed to commit to a program that was high-intensity but that didn't take up a ton of time so I ordered ZCUT. I am only one week in and I'm already seeing results. While weight loss really isn't my goal, I have already lost a pound and am gaining muscle definition!

If you commit to giving maximum effort during the workouts and support your training with clean, healthy eating, there is NO WAY you will not get results! I have a Bachelor's in Exercise Science and am getting ready to earn my Masters in Exercise Physiology so I understand the science behind exercise and Zuzana has developed a program that aligns with both my educational knowledge and practical experience.",1363996800,2,1005,4.7102272727272725
5527968,3,B00AY5JB92,"This is obviously a  review of zuzka's DVDs. I am not going to give a detailed breakdown because so many people have; I will just state how I feel about it. I like zuzana and her you tube workouts, so I don't wanna give anyone the wrong impression; but I honestly thought it would be much harder. When you see the advertisement, she says that she took her most effective, hardest moves and put them all on the tapes. I thought she was gonna bring the pain, but when I watched the videos, I saw that she basically used the same exercises. So the whole point is, that if you don't have the tapes yet, don't feel bad. You are not missing anything. The workouts aren't any harder, or different than on youtube. Now don't get it twisted, they are hard, but the workouts are still similar. The good thing is, that if your computer goes through the buffering shananagins, it is good to be able to play it on your dvd player. And by the way, I did do some of the workouts and they have the same effect and intensity as the youtube routines.",1363996800,3,1032,4.26530612244898

Without a doubt these short workouts will bring all the results I want to see without hanging in the fitness studio for hours but in the privacy of my home and in the shortes amount of time.

Thank you Zuzka for all of the fitness videos in the past which you have done for free with so much passion. All the advice for health, fitness, food and life in general. Finally I can show some gratitude and can order the DVDs from Europe too. Thank you, you have changed my look on fitness and health!!",1363824000,,620,4.081967213114754

I have anticipated a DVD series from you and now that it's here, I am certainly not disappointed! I have tried P-90X and others and they are just silly compared to yours. I doubt that Tony Horton could keep up with you for 2 minutes. It is also apparent that you really care and are passionate about helping people get in shape unlike many who are just out to make a buck. Thank you! That passion is my motivation.

I was a little worried about effectiveness, but these are great workouts, especially for days when you are short on time, but still want to be challenged.

5527982,5,B00AY5JB92,I've followed Zuzanna for a long time and this 3 DVD set is the best value in the history of workout DVDs. She put together three DVDs worth of her best and hardest workout routines that go no longer than 15 minutes each but make you feel like you worked out for hours. This makes Insanity look like garbage. This DVD set is easily worth double what they are charging now. Highly recommended!,1363651200,,392,4.383561643835616
5527983,4,B00AY5JB92,"I like these videos because Zuzka was quite serious when she put together these set of exercises. There is lots of jumping included and if you don't have a good exercise like surface to use during workout, there is a possibility that you can be injure, so be wise and use the best surfaces to workout on. I've seen changes to my body since I began using her videos.

I believe that anyone who wants to reach his/her exercise goals can do so using Zuzka's videos. She is committed and dedicated and used lots of advance exercises in these videos.",1363478400,,545,4.45

They provide consistency between workouts, but are also different enough to give you variety.  If you follow her ZWOW workouts online, then these will look familiar.  For those who complain that there is no music on the DVD's, I would like to provide another perspective.  I have DVD's that have music, and after a while, the music becomes annoying and repetitive.  I prefer these, because I can play whatever I want to go along with them.  I am used to doing Jillian Michaels DVD's and prefer these by a landslide.  Anyways, if you are on the fence, I would encourage you to go for it.  What do you have to lose?  Some fat maybe!",1363305600,,755,4.405797101449275

The moves are not complicated, but really make you sweat. After seeing the definition starting to build, I'm hooked. My husband does these videoes with me as well. He loves these work outs. I also had a great response with customer service when I had an issue with one of the DVDs. They resolved the matter quickly, and I am a satisfied customer.

For $15 it's a no-brainer. The DVD qualitiy good and the workouts in true Zuzana form -- awesome and intense.  I've been following Zuzana for a long long time and have combined her workouts with other forms of HIIT, P90x (and other Beach Body Products).  Her workouts are fast and effective and her style motivating and infectous -- a powerful combination.",1362960000,,512,4.615384615384615
5528001,5,B00AY5JB92,"Truth be told, I have been following Zuzana for at least three years; when I first discovered her and started following her example, I lost about thirty pounds in three to four months, so I know Zuzana's methods deliver. However, it takes a great deal of dedication and effort on YOUR part to achieve the results you want. Zuzana is best well known for her high intensity exercises; she isn't going to go easy on you (or herself, for that matter). The exercises in the ZCUT Power Cardio DVD set are most certainly going to test your resolve in your weight loss/ physical fitness journey. Stick with them, however, and you WILL experience results.

What I appreciate most from these DVDs is how Zuzana uses a sort of coaching method: Rather than jumping right into the workout and explaining the moves as you are expected to perform them, Zuzana breaks down every exercise move PRIOR to actually starting the workout. She explains and shows proper form, and performs the move a few times. You are free to join her at your own leisure (recommended). This also gives Zuzana, and you, the opportunity of working out together. She does not have to stop in the middle of the workout to show you how a move is performed because you already have a basic understanding of it, and both of you can struggle through the workout together (Personally, I find it far more motivating to see the fitness instructor fight through to the end like you).

Each of these DVDs also come with a warm-up, cool-down, and an additional abdominal workout. While I would have preferred her record her workouts WITH the warm-up and cool-down, it is still a great comfort to know that they ARE there, and that I do not have worry so much about what I am going to do before and after my workout. Also, be sure to start off and end with the warm-up/cool-down; they do a great deal in preventing injury and in recovery.

With all of that said and done, if you are fairly new to fitness, it probably would not be recommended that you follow these routines  to a T. You can aim to successfully finish the routine like Zuzana does, but it's OK if you can't. If you feel like you need to adjust a few of the exercises to accommodate your fitness level, that's fine, too. What matters the most in fitness is that you WORK for it. Put in the effort, and you will find satisfaction in how you feel, if not in your results.",1362960000,8,2381,4.47926267281106
5528002,5,B00AY5JB92,"So I had seen Zuzka on youtube and thought her workouts were great, yet I never actually did the workouts.  I was too lazy, too busy (insert any other lame excuse here you want).  My wife and I just started doing the zcardio series last week.  I must admit I have let myself go, but thats kind of the point of getting back into shape.

The workouts are INTENSE.  I had to hit the pause button quite a bit. I am planning on doing modified workouts another week or two and then go back and start over at week one and try to hang with Zuzana. It is perfect for my situation because the workouts are quick and effective and if you have a busy schedule (who does not these days)you still have time to fit these workouts in.  It is also perfect in that you don't need to go buy equipment or pay for an expensive gym membership.  In addition, Z is posting a daily blog. That's right she is doing the workouts as well as posting her diet and giving diet tips. She is very positive and upbeat which makes it all the better. At this price it's a steal in my humble opinion and anyone can afford it at this price.

So if you are looking to get back in shape buy this now and tone that body up!",1362873600,,1182,4.064655172413793

One thing that I feel this video is missing is that the cooling down stretch part is a bit weak. It would be better if she puts more various stretching moves. I do the stretching additionally by serching for other moves that I might have missed. Other than that, I am absolutely satisfied. And the calender really works for me. It is really like she is with me every time cheering me up.",1362700800,,663,4.346774193548387

You will see results.  I like the ability to take them with me when I'm traveling places a bit more remote with no internet, or when my internetat home is acting up.  There's no excuse to not spend 10-12 minutes a day making yourself look and feel good.  I am cursing her midway through each workout, but loving her by the end........and excited to come back for more.  Zuzka, you are a machine!  You are fierce!

After workout six, I am continuing to see great improvement. I would have never believed that you could get results this fast, with such a short workout.

She continues to upload new workouts on youtube, but it is very nice to have something on hands and do workouts whenever I want to without going to the web.",1362614400,,426,4.023529411764706

I'v seen results in my body 1st week you have too be ready to keep your diet clean if you want to see maximum results. Either way your strenght will increase, and your body will firm up.

I placed my order in January, and it's now March and I've reached out a few times to understand where they may be or what my options are to obtaining them. There has been no acknowledgement of my request which has been very disappointing - especially as an avid enthusiast for your brand and your advice.

I am so happy to have stumbled upon the zcut DVDs. There are 12 workouts total with a bonus ab workout and warm-up/cool down. I am on day 2 and while it was tough, I really feel like I am getting results. I used to have a personal trainer but stopped that due to the cost. With zcut, I am getting an intense workout just like I used to with a trainer.  I have not found another exercise DVD that I can say that about (and I have ALOT of videos)!  I am truly enjoying the workouts and can't wait to see the zwows on DVD! I plan on purchasing more sets for gifts to my fellow workout friends.",1362268800,,884,4.182352941176471
5528018,5,B00AY5JB92,"Im forty years old, so its not as easy to get in shape. I have been a follower since around March 2012, using her utube videos only 2-3 times a week. Noticed results quickly! I find her workouts to be the easiest to stick to, being only 10-15 minutes a day. I have seen a major change! You only spend a few minutes working out per day, you do not need expensive equipment, and you can do this anywhere! I actually stuck to my program when I took my trip a few weeks ago and did my workout in a motel room, with very little space, and only a 9 minute workout leaving me time with my honey to go to the jacuzzi in a swimsuit, feeling confident! My back is tight, and backside is getting a nice lifted curvy look. The push-ups and burpees help lift the chest and tone the upper body. Someone criticized her somewhere saying she does not utilize back exercises, yet with the different styles of burpees, you will work your entire back, I noticed my back looking really awesome! I have gotten quite a few compliments lately about having a slimmer hourglass shape. Women at work often want to know how I keep in shape, so I tell them about Zuzanna! If you do this, you will be suprised at the results, and you will have time to do other fun activities like hiking, biking, swimming or whatever it is you enjoy. No need to go spend all that time in the gym and on expensive equipment! You can take these workouts anywhere! This is a great workout for beginners or for those who are more advanced in thier fitness level. Whether your someone who has not exercised much and have a lot of weight to lose, or your already in great shape, these workouts will benefit and challenge you. So get started, and make sure you keep track of what you eat! You will most certainly get the most amazing results from whatever your starting point if you tailor your eating habits and keep track of calories. I feel so good since I have purchased this dvd! I noticed amazing results when I was strict with my food. I follow the calender she gives us, the first month comes with the dvds, then the next two are downloadable on her site. If I miss a day, which sometimes I do since I work 13 hour shifts, I just make it up. Otherwise I follow the calender as she advises. Stick with it! You will be pleased with the results!",1362182400,2,2297,4.270642201834862
5528019,5,B00AY5JB92,"Before I found Zuzka on Youtube sharing all of her knowledge for free, I was buying a lot of exercise videos. I have seen a lot of different approaches to this kind of DVDs and I have to say that Zuzka's is one of the best and most affordable.

Her workouts are fast, super high intensity and all different. You will see results fast! Faster than with other videos! I had been doing her Youtube videos for a while before buying the DVDs, but when I started following these workouts I was really sore.

Including the warmup and the cool down, you are looking at 20 to 25min max, which makes it perfect. You will be done with your work out in no time at all. This is perfect for busy people and people like me that tend to get lazy if working out requires a lot of time, equipment and preparation.

A plus is that she is not annoying like a lot of the other physical trainers on other videos. There is no annoying music and the set she uses is pleasing to look at. Perfect video right?!

The calendar included keeps me motivated. I like that it tells me what to do each day. You can also search on Youtube for: zcut day?, and you will find a video of her giving you extra advice including diet and recipes! Buy these DVDs, you won't regret it! She is awesome and inspiring!",1362182400,,1271,4.2181069958847734

You will get 3 DVDs and it comes with a 30-day calendar, which shows you the workout you should do that day and a skinny tip on your active rest day. There is a warm up, cool down, and bonus ab workout in each DVD, including her 4 kick-butt workouts in each. The best of all is that you don't need any equipment! I just used a chair and a pair of dumbbells...who doesn't have these in their house?!?!

I'm already in a decent shape but want to tone up my abs for the spring. It's been 28 days that I've been doing her DVD workouts including her ZWOWs on YouTube and I'm already seeing more definition in my entire body! I would recommend this DVD if you want short and effective workouts. I know it's a good workout if I break a sweat and try to catch my breath within 10 minutes.

On day 4 now and I'm loving it!  I pair the DVDs with either a Zwow or any other website that I'm using for a strength training exercise, then I do the Zcut after.

I feel great and I'm moving this series!  Thanks, Zuzka!",1362096000,,504,4.197916666666667
5528025,5,B00AY5JB92,"I used to follow Freddy and Zuzka at BodyRock a few years ago and always found Zuzka's rescipes and info pretty great. Also her workouts have always been great for both women and men. When she and BodyRock went separate ways, everything I liked about BodyRock seemed to disappear. At the time I didn't realize that Zuzka was the reason behind most of what I liked about the website, but now I do.

One thing I really like about her is that she truly seems to do it all out of the love of both fitness and helping others. Sure she's making some money with the DVDs, website, etc. However she puts so much great information out there for free and always has. Recipes, workouts, eating advice, etc.

These DVDs are a great a value. Each DVD is about 90 minutes long. Each DVD is packed full of workouts with an accompanying calendar plan telling you when to do each workout. Someone on here made the comment that there was no music and the DVDs were ""boring"". The average workout DVD has a lot of ""fluff"" and not much content. These DVDs are full of content. They are geared towards getting someone to the workout quickly and getting someone through a tough workout as efficiently as possible. Also a lot of people keep making the comment that you can't look like her by working out 12 minutes a day. First of all, that is true for some people. Everyone is genetically different. However they will get you into better shape. Most of the people who say to the contrary are accustomed to running on a treadmill at a constant pace for 30-45 minutes and not getting results. I challenge anyone to try that and then compare it to doing one of these workouts. I can guarantee that you will feel these workouts much more than a long treadmill session. Additionally there is a lot of research out there right now about how HIIT workouts increases metabolism. Not to mention that these workouts take someone 12 minutes to complete only if they can keep up with Zuzka. Not to mention there is a warm up and cool down that you do with each workout. So even if you do keep up with her, you are still active for a minimum of about 27 minutes. The average person who hasn't been doing HIIT will not be able to keep up. So rather they are hitting pause, catching their breath and then continuing.

So all this said, I think these videos are a great value. My wife is certified as a fitness instructor and has always been into fitness since I've known her. However she lost some of the passion for it after having a baby. These DVDs and Zuzka's website have sparked a fire in her that had been missing. So for that I thank Zuzka and those involved.",1362009600,3,2629,4.394250513347022

it changes you inside and out... it worth to try.. lack of time is not an excuse , its only 15 minutes most of the cases... if someone has not 15 minutes a day for itself... start thinking of a new lifestyle... only excuse are injuries .. then i would not recommend it ...you need to be healthy to do these workouts..",1362009600,,982,4.522471910112359

I lost to much weight, gained it back and have been able to maintain that weight, but now it is time to tone up. I have been following Zuzka since she was on Bodyrock.tv. When she left, I stopped following because the workouts got really complicated. I mean really, doing 5 different moves in 50 secs? Maybe for some people that is a workout, but for me it was a twisted ankle, and a sprained wrist.

I was excited when I found Zuzk on youtube again. My stomach and arms have firmed up a lot since restarting with her.

My first round with the dvd, I did the warm up and of course workout # 1. I was done. I could not breath. Now, I have been making good times with her youtube videos but with this workout, there just was not a point were I could just catch my breath. I must love the punishment because I thought that was awesome. I think these videos will help me lose the layer on my tummy that I have been fitting for months now.

It comes with a calendar for month 1  so u know which workouts to do on which days. I downloaded calendars for months 2 and 3 off the website. With all of this for $15 she's practically giving it away. I am definitely more than satisfied and she's made a lifelong fan out of me.",1361923200,,593,4.112068965517241

5528033,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am completely addicted to Zuzana's workouts. I have followed her since I first found her with BodyRock and I will gladly follow her where ever her fitness career takes her.

I am currently six weeks into the ZCUT program. I was really bummed when I missed four days due to a cold I got, but I was able to pick right back up and keep pushing forward. I honestly haven't lost much weight. I'll lose one week and gain it back the next, but I have lost almost 10"" off of my body since starting. That is my proof and I highly reccoment to anyone doing anykind of workout to take the time to take before photos and keep up with weekly measurements because it'll give you a visual of your progress. Especially if you're someone like me who wishes the numbers one the scale would magically go down but don't and it's discouraging.

I won't sugar coat it. These workouts are tough! They are comparable to Insanity except they are only 10-15 minutes long and there are no given breaks. It's all about the effort you put into them. So find your motivation and push through it. Don't be intimidated if you can't keep up. Just pause the video, take a few deep breaths and do it at your own pace until you catch up. Believe me, I've had to do this numerous times, but when I complete a workout without pausing it. I give myself a well deserved pat on the back.

There are 12 workouts, a warm up, cool down and bonus abs video. Each DVD has 4 workouts plus the warm up, cool down and bonus abs so you don't have to switch out discs constantly while working out. The first months calendar comes with disc one and you can download months two and three for free from her website. It was filmed just as her YouTube videos are so don't expect crazy cinematogrophy or corny music. She has marketed this product for an outrageously low price and I feel that it is absolutely worth it to buy this product.",1361923200,2,1884,4.301408450704225
5528034,4,B00AY5JB92,"I've been doing these workouts for a month now and have noticed a marked improvement in my fitness as well as how my body looks and feels. This is without any extra workouts or special diet adjustments. My abs look better than they ever have!

It is true that these workouts are very similar to the ZWOWs that Zuzka has been posting for free for quite a while. However, it has really helped me to have a schedule of which type of workout to do every day rather than sorting through YouTube looking for one that sounds good. I also love being able to workout at the same time as Zuzka and watching her struggle sometimes, too.

The production values of the DVDs are admittedly pretty bad. No music and an oddly sparse set are not exactly the style I'm used to. But there's really no arguing with the results I've seen in such a short time.",1361923200,,838,4.3312101910828025

The workouts range from about 10-15 minutes.  They are very intense and will have your heart pounding and your body dripping sweat.  The Ab Bonus is good too.  Overall, if you're considering getting the ZCut dvds I'd say go for it.  They are definitely worth the money.",1361923200,,406,4.714285714285714

But, I love the shorter routines.  I can't do longer, steady state workouts anymore.  I had been following Zuzka on her website and, she was my favorite on her former site.  Sometimes I had trouble viewing the videos from her website on my IPAD.  The DVDs are perfect.

As soon as I heard about the DVDs I bought them. They're high quality, but simple so that you can have multiple workouts on one DVD. I also love the fact that there is NO music in the DVD. That means that I can turn up the volume to Zuzana's voice while blasting my own workout mixes. I love it. I wish all exercise DVDs were like this one.
Additionally, Zuzana's workouts are always a challenge and the fact that they are so short makes me want to work even harder. It doesn't take but a couple minutes to leave you breathless and by the end I'm doused in sweat, muscles are numb, and I'm ready for a shower.

5528041,5,B00AY5JB92,I have been following Zuzka for over a year but never did the exercises until now. I am 57 and not in shape. I have completed the 12 workouts (two weeks and two days) and have lost pounds and inches. I see definition in my arms that I've never had in my life!  These are short and intense workouts but SO worth it.,1361836800,2,314,3.984126984126984
5528042,5,B00AY5JB92,"These workouts are amazing. They are short effective and fun. The best part comes when you complete all 12 workouts and start to repeat them. I thought I would get bored but it's just the opposite, it's so much fun and motivating to see how much better you're getting. My stamina, endurance and form have improved so much and I am loving the results. Thank you Zuzana.",1361836800,,368,4.507462686567164
5528043,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have already completed the first 30 days of this workout program and I have had some great results.  I started doing Zuzka's ZWOWs in October 2012 and knew that these DVDs would be just as great as her other workouts.  In 30 days I have lost 3 inches off each thigh and 2 inches off my hips. I wanted to see how much more I could push during a ZWOW, so I went back and did some of the ZWOWs I did the week before starting the 30 days.  I am doing each ZWOW 4 to 5 minutes faster and I don't need to modify the moves as much as I did before.  I am very happy!  These DVDs work well and they work fast!",1361836800,3,602,3.746031746031746
5528044,5,B00AY5JB92,"This workout is amazing and you can't beat the price. There are 3 dvds each with 4 workouts on them. Workouts are 10 minutes long. Some a little longer. But all are super intense. So you can do 1 ten minute workout or as many as you're able. I love the fact that Zuzka does the entire workout with you. And even she has to take a little break here and there. Do not hesitate to buy this series if you want to break your plateau and see some fast results. I have never heard of Zuzka before this, but I'm glad I heard of her now.",1361836800,2,528,3.94392523364486

5528046,5,B00AY5JB92,"The workouts on these DVDs are perfect for my schedule.  Including warm up and cool down, you can finish a really good workout in about 20 minutes.  You'll start feeling results almost immediately.  The exercises are simple to understand and really effective.  The DVDs kick your butt at first, however, very soon you start getting addicted to how much better you feel.  Then you start looking forward to working out.  I haven't had that feeling in a long time and it's nice to be excited about taking good care of myself.  Some of moves are pretty high impact but obvious substitutions are there if you're like me and have a bad knee.  Overall I can't recommend these DVDs enough.  Totally worth the money!",1361750400,3,707,4.682926829268292

5528049,4,B00AY5JB92,"Really like the variety of workouts. Straight forward and not mundane. There is definitely a challenge to all of the zows.
Calendar included very helpful to stick with a plan. Not rating 5 stars because I was expecting more workouts. However, there is always her site for more.",1361750400,2,277,4.791666666666667

I have loved Zuzka's ZWOWs for many months and was really excited to do this program because her ZWOWs were really tough for me. I can't wait to finish these 90 days because I know after this program I will be able to do so much better on the ZWOWs. The workouts are short but ridiculously intense. If you don't like to sweat then this isn't for you. I'm excited to see my results after completing the program but I can already say that it works.",1361664000,,569,4.181818181818182

5528053,5,B00AY5JB92,"Received the product in great condition. Sealed and brand new within a week. Just got it today ....watched the first DVD's 4 workouts and amazed at the intensity it contains. You can tell because Zuska's out of breath and had difficulty finishing the workouts herself. I can't wait to start it on Monday. I'm usually a Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, Turbo Fire fan but I have a feeling Zusca will be my next trainer! I love a new challenge! She seems genuine and wants you to get your workouts in without wasting your time and money!!! A must buy!! if you want to be challenged!!",1361577600,,578,4.514285714285714
5528054,4,B00AY5JB92,"I love Zuz and have since way back at BodyRock.  I was super excited to get these DVD's and ordered them ASAP.  They got here quickly (which I understand wasn't the case for everyone).

I have been using them for about 6 weeks now (just finished week #2 on calendar #2) and I have seen a distinct difference in my body.  I have lost an inch off my waist and half an inch off my hips.  It has reduced my body fat by quite a lot and toned/firmed me up quite nicely.  I am stating to be able to see my abs and after 2 kids I wasn't sure that was going to be possible.  I am a pretty big fan of the workouts.

I also love the calendars with the workouts listed because generally, as a lazy person, if working out is too much effort, I won't do it.  This is why I workout at home vs the gym.  The gym requires GOING to the gym and then working out, it is too much effort (yes I admitted I am lazy).  That is how the calendar helps me as well.  I don't have to think about what workout I am going to do, or which I should do since legs were featured yesterday etc.  The workout is listed for me and all I have to do is pop it in and go.

I gave the DVD's a 4 star review vs a 5 star for a couple of reasons that are overall minor, but worth noting.

1. A lot of the workouts are time challenges.  I have been following Z awhile now but I couldn't keep up with her at all when I first started, which meant quite a bit of pausing the DVD.  Not a huge deal, but it was a mild annoyance.

2. There is no music.  I can play my own (and often do) but like I said, worth noting.",1361577600,17,1565,3.7746913580246915
5528055,5,B00AY5JB92,"Zuzka's workouts are second to none. This girl will work you more than any other circuit training program out there. I just love this girl's videos. She is really in shape and it motivates you to work out along with her. She pushes me right to my limits and I have been training for many years. If you want to get in shape, look great, up your health and live a better quality of life Zuka's the program for you.
The only thing that I wish it had more of is a diet program to go along with it. How ever, you can catch her on you tube on her Z chef channel.",1361577600,,556,3.9292035398230087
5528056,5,B00AY5JB92,"There is nothing to dislike. Her workouts are the best. I have followed Zuzka's workouts for several years now and they have changed my whole approach to working out. I'm addicted--in a good way. How can you not be! You don't need equipment and you don't need more than 10, 15 or 20 minutes to get in an awesome workout. And don't be fooled by the ""cardio"" heading. True, while these workouts are more cardio driven then her other workouts, they have plenty of strength-training weaved in. You get in a full body workout with each one. Add to that the fact that she performs each exercise with impeccable form--and stresses that you must do so as well by showing the correct form for each movement. And the bonus: the warm-up and cool down provided in this series is spot on. That was always my biggest challenge, warming up and cooling down. But she provides in this Dvd set two of the best routines--at least for me--that are easy to follow (and remember), and quick too.

I am so grateful for having found her workouts. She delivers them with such passion and genuineness. I can never go back to my old way of working out. Nor do I want to. Zuzka's workouts work! I have never felt stronger. I have never looked leaner. And now, I am so close to achieving the body of my dreams just by doing her workouts and making sure I have a diet that supports my training (which she emphasizes all the time as well). There are plenty of exercise products/trainers to choose from, but for me, none compare. And the price for all this, it's just so beyond reasonable. I can't wait for another Dvd set by Zuzka, I will buy it the minute it's available (just like I did with this one). And I know I will love every single workout in it (just like I do with this one).",1361577600,2,1755,4.36697247706422
5528057,5,B00AY5JB92,"Excellent series of workouts. Zuzka has a bright and energetic spirit that makesyou motivated to be ""your"" own personal best. A great and must have addition to the ZWOWs. Do not delay, get these dvds asap. You won't regret it! Thank you Zuzka for all you do to bring us great workouts and useful information.",1361491200,,308,4.618181818181818

5528059,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been doing Zuzka's online workouts at zuzkalight.com for sometime now and have always loved them. They're short but intense and really give results. This cardio series does the same thing: short, intense, results! Zuzka is so realistic. She uses these workouts in her own daily routines and it shows in her awesome body.
I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is serious about getting in shape.
Don't forget guys, diet is half the battle. Don't expect to have her body if you're still eating out at McDonalds every night!",1361491200,3,538,4.858695652173913
5528060,5,B00AY5JB92,This is the best total body workout you can get in under 30 minutes. It's a challenge that works you hard.  Zuska explains everything and gives a demonstration before you get started and it's on from there.  You defintely get your moneys worth with this set.  I can't wait to see the results of this workout in 30 days.,1361491200,,319,4.372881355932203

So of course I got the DVDs and I thought this is going to be challenging but I'll be ok. Oooooh noooo, was I wrong this definitely has a high cardio component that has kicked my butt and left me in puddles of sweat. I make sure my makeup is off before doing these now or I'm sure to look like a raccoon. Thanks Zuzkalight for awesome workouts yet again. I will never do another 1 hr plus long work out again. Go get it....you'll spend more at one meal and you can have this for life.",1361491200,,613,4.116666666666666

Totally recommended!!",1361404800,2,337,3.9558823529411766

5528065,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am a beginner for HIIT . It's really tough for me for follow all the moves in this DVD, but I really love it. By doing this work out alone is not enough to lose weight. So I usually go jogging for 30+ min and come home do this work out.",1361318400,,238,3.5961538461538463

What a waste of time. High Intensity Interval Training...Short, tough workouts that get the job done. Remember though... Diet is 90%...Eat clean and you will see results fast!",1361318400,,353,4.53125
5528068,5,B00AY5JB92,"This is the best program for losing the extra weight and toning up your muscles! These workouts are short but very intense (well, as intense as you want them to be). As long as you are committed to the plan and push yourself  and follow a reasonable diet, this workout series is the best. I have tried other series and they were good, but usually required 45 minutes a day or longer. This series is just as great and much shorter. Zuzana is real and sweet and committed to get us all in as great a shape as she is! I have worked out on a regular basis for years but have seen a real difference in my muscle tone since I started following Zuzka!",1361318400,6,644,4.152
5528069,5,B00AY5JB92,I love Zuzana's workouts have been doing them for a year (via Youtube) and these videos are fantastic. My only complaint was there wasn't clear instructions on which workouts to do first and so I  was a little off on schedule. I thought it was similar to P90X and the first month you do one DVD then progress to the second DVD. Good thing I went back to the other reviews and now know to do all the DVDs and rotate through again.,1361232000,,429,4.168674698795181
5528070,4,B00AY5JB92,"I have been following Zuzana since 2009 and I wanted to up my training with her and also support her in anyway and every way possible. :) I also wanted to actually use the DVDs before giving it a review; just because I say Zuzka is 5 stars, doesn't mean this automatically is. :)

""Power Cardio"" is a perfect title. Workout #1 kicked my ass. The ab bonus is a great challenge for off days or as an add on to any of the workouts on the DVDs. The calendar is easy to follow and this program does not take a lot of daily time. They are similar to ZWOWs, but she does include a lot more cardio and requires a lot more speed from you. She does not take many breaks like she does in some ZWOWs. Zuzka pushes me through each workout and sometimes I have a hard time keeping up! haha! But that's a good thing! I find this series to be a positive added bonus to the workouts I've been doing with her and is pretty advanced. If you are beginner, pace yourself, but do not get discouraged.

The only thing I don't like is the warm up and one aspect of the cool down:
The warm up needs a bit of cardio-prep like jogging in place or something. After following the warm up and doing the first routine for the first time I had to stop it and start over after 5 burpees. LOL. My body wasn't cardio-prepared. So I suggest doing a bit of light jogging in place while you watch Zuzka explain the exercises. That's what I do now and it makes a HUGE difference. As for the cool down, there's no upper body stretching which was odd. The stretching is so great for the legs and lower body, but I found I had to do my own upper body stretches. That's no big deal, but just a little thing I noticed.

I KNOW Zuzana's workouts work because I've done them and have seen results, so I have no doubt within 90 days time that I will see major improvement in my cardio strength and endurance. If you are looking to up your workouts, I highly suggest this series! :)",1361232000,10,1934,4.1246684350132625

5528076,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've never written a review before but I had to cause I love Zuzka and wanted to show my support and aprreciation. I started doing her workouts back when she was still hosting Bodyrock and I was struggling to get in shape even though I was taking spinning classes 3-5x a week plus weight training. Needless to say, none of my efforts worked until l started doing her workouts...........I lost 25+ lbs in less than 2 months. I got hooked ever since and I'll follow and support her regardles!
The only complaint I have is against Amazon itself which is giving Puerto Rico residents a hard time when it comes to shipping.........I used to buy a lot from this site and out of the sudden they won't ship to PR, so I had to use a forwarding company to get my DVD's cause I wanted them so bad. This is the last time I'll buy from Amazon until they fix this mess.",1361232000,2,855,4.283950617283951

5528079,5,B00AY5JB92,I really like Zuzana's selection of work out DVDs- I think her work out is very dynamic and targeting the problematic zones most women like to have toned.

5528080,5,B00AY5JB92,"The workouts are intense, but doable, and they really work. What I love the most is that on her website, she has a new video everyday with tips about doing the workouts, diet, and motivation. I think this is really a system where you will see results, especially because of the coaching she does. The price is really great as well, because there's a whole lot of workout videos like this out there that are double or triple what these cost, and don't offer daily coaching. Can't go wrong here.",1361145600,,493,4.488888888888889

I love that they require minimal equipment and includes a poster with a schedule guidleline to follow. You won't regret this purchase.

Perfect for people with not a lot of time to workout. Very effective",1361145600,,488,4.388888888888889

The ZCUT DVDs brings all of the challenge I epected based on ZWOWs from the website zuzkalight.com, without the need for equiptment other than an occasional chair. Even a number is uneccessary as you can go off of the time on the DVD. I've never used workout videos before, and I'm sure there will be room for improvement, but I'm down 7 pounds in 21 days and looking more defined and others are noticing. So I'd say it's doing the job for $15.",1361145600,,550,4.401960784313726

Workouts are same style as the youtube workouts, so she has 4 to 6 different exercises that she alternates and repeats in sets of 10 reps or as many as you can do and then you do 1-2-3 rounds of the whole thing again. I find it easier to follow a pre-set routine for the 90 day program and then just keep getting better as I get stronger. I do this with other weight routines I do and I think I will be fine b/c the workouts are only 20 minutes but effective and challenging which is my main thing b/c I get bored fast.

5528086,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been following Zuzana for many years. At first her workouts seemed to be too hard for me to do, I would watch and not try. Then the more I listened to her and she encourages people to do what they can physically but to do something I began to try her workouts. I would start off with modified moves and slowly build up the strength to do more next time. Her workouts are amazing, and she is a great motivator. I have lost 10lbs but for me I wasn't looking to drop weight I was looking to be in shape and gain strength. I can now do regular style pushups and burpees. I have more toned muscle and I feel better. Her workouts are what I need, short and intense. When life is busy you tend to put off exercise for little things because you think there isn't enough time. With her workouts there is enough time and you feel like you put in a hard two hours at the gym. Just try her videos and follow her, you will feel better, gain strength, and have time to do other activities. She has lots of helpful tips on her website, and youtube channel as well.",1361059200,3,1054,4.121359223300971

Zuzka provides a warm up, a cool down, and a bonus ab workout in addition to all of the workouts and a fold out calendar to track progress. I have not changed my diet at all and am noticing changes all over. My butt is rounder and higher, more tone in my legs, torso, and arms.

I never did one of the ZWOWs and started with this on a Sunday. This series is INTENSE but short. I follow every WO up with a 2 mile vigorous walk. I am so proud of myself when I'm done. I am 260 lbs and modify some of the moves. This dvd will get you into shape and improve your endurance. I lost 7 lbs the first week and 5 this week. She gives modification options during the review for most exercises and they help. I feel better already and happy with my purchase. Plus, you can't beat the price. Get these.

I have enjoyed her free ZWOW's and have seen some of her older bodyrock.tv videos as well, but what I like most about these DVD's are that she has compiled the best of the best workouts for maximum results in this series.  I also like the calendar that is included and how easy it is to follow along with her program. I tend to get bored easily working out.  For some reason, even though these workouts can be brutal, I enjoy them more!  I am fully aware that in order to get a body like hers, I will have to eventually add more than just these daily workouts...  but for someone trying to establish good exercise habits and get the ball rolling, these DVD's are perfect.  I have only been doing the ZCUT program for 3 weeks and have already lost 5 lbs, 2 inches around my waist, and an inch from both my arms and legs.  My abs also look more defined (especially my obliques) than they ever have before.  I've never really been overweight, but the term ""skinny fat"" applies to me.  This type of high intensity cardio training will be a big step in helping me achieve my goals.  I feel overall that for the price of these DVD's and what they can do for you, I'm getting a huge bang for my buck.  Not to mention that I think Zuzka is one of the most genuine fitness motivators I've yet to discover and I am glad I can finally support her in some way.

I am trying to lose the last of the baby weight after my third child. I haven't had much success so far with other DVD's besides getting more muscle definition - but no weight loss-  until now.  Have lost 4 lbs in the last couple weeks - and that is due to following the Zcut dvd's and following her diet advice on her website as she goes through the workouts.  I have also upped my water intake a bunch, which I think makes me less hungry and more able to control cravings.  But overall, this dvd is wonderful!!  She is the real deal!! I was skeptical that you could get that good of a workout in during such a short amount of time - but the feeling you get after completing one of these short workouts lets you know how much you just accomplished.

I can do anything for 10-15 minutes.  I CAN do this.  I am not alone, Zuka is right there with me, encourageing me, doing the workout in real time.  She stumbles, loses count, finally a real person to help me.  She takes time to answer questions that you submit.  She is not just selling a system, but also a service.

5528119,5,B00AY5JB92,"As a new mom who spent the last year or so taking it easy and eating whatever I wanted, to say I'm out of shape is a huge understatement. I've been watching Zuzana's youtube videos for some time (I call them workout porn! Her body is amazing.) I did all of 1 of them and remember being sore for 5 days. When the DVDs came out, I thought, this is it. She inspires me, so I'm going to finally get off my ass and do it!

I've done workouts 1 and 2 so far and holy *, are they difficult. I don't come close to keeping up with her pace, so I have to pause it constantly to finish my reps. My heart feels like it's going to explode, my legs are shaky and my back isn't happy at all. But I LOVE IT! She reviews all the exercises first, which is helpful, and I find her encouragement very inspiring. I know I suck at this right now, my form is probably crap, but I can only get better, and I know these workouts are exactly what I need. I only have one hour before my bedtime that I can fit in exercise. The workouts take me longer than the Zuzana (sorry, I know she goes by Zuzka now but she'll always be Zuzana to me) so I spend about 30-40 min doing a workout that takes her 12 min. But still, that's a small amount of time to get in an intense burning heart-pounding workout. And I expect my time to shorten as I get better at it.

Not crazy about her cool down workout, as I find the moves to be too difficult and awkward to feel a good stretch. I just modify as I see fit and do the stretches I'm comfortable with.

I'm also reading her blog daily and watching her Youtube videos where she talks about each day of the DVD program before and after she does that day's workout. She gives tips on nutrition and her enthusiasm and encouragement is contagious.

Best $15 I ever spent!

I received my DVDs in 2 days and have had no issues with operating them, as others have reported.",1360627200,,1876,4.045822102425876

Zuzka just has a way to keep you motivated, without being pushy. She even walks with you through these workouts, and gives some pretty sound nutritional advice.

5528121,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have followed Zuzka light for about a year now, and in that time I have lost 12 inches around my waist alone, and another 12 inches all over my body, and lost 50lbs. So just for that reason I bought the zcut series.

It took about a week and a half to receive.

The workouts on the dvds are similar in moves to zwows available on youtube,  but they are more cardio, throughout the workout I am much more out of breath and the set up of the workouts are a little different.

The main reason I say that these zcut workouts are different than zwows is because every single day zuzana is uploading a video on youtube about the zcut series, it is like you have a personal trainer in your home, every single day leading you through the program, day by day, giving diet tips, tips on keeping your form, and motivation to keep going!

yes, you could use the zwows in the same way. I have, and I've lost a lot of weight and gotten much stronger doing that.",1360627200,,949,4.163934426229508

5528125,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have bought & used many different DVD exercise videos in my lifetime and I know what Works! I already love this program because ZUZKA has set me (& you!) up for success.  These three DVDS along with the nutritional information ZUZKA offers on her website are just the motivation I needed to get back into the best shape of my life at 45! The workouts are super fast so you really don't have time to think, just follow ZUZKA & push yourself as hard as you can & you will see the results fast! These workouts focus on strength & cardio at the same time which means you don't waste any time.

I allowed myself to morph outta shape over the past two years, which has had me a little depressed and overwhelmed at the thought of starting over again. Simply knowing that ZUZKA is doing this program again & again and getting her amazing results has allowed me to change that stinkin' thinkin' into positive thoughts. I no longer feel that I've ""got"" to start over, but that I ""get"" to start over! I know that by following ZUZANA's lead I am already on my way to the rock hard body I am willing to work for. I love how you use your own body weight so that not having the right equipment or gym membership are no longer excuses!

I have to thank ZUZKA for her dedication to my success because I feel that she personally has put her whole heart & soul into motivating me! I am excited about having all of this information in one place because I confess, without ZUZKA's momentum pushing me in the right direction, I might have gotten distracted from my fitness goals again! I am certain that its just a matter of time before I achieve my dream body now that I have the keys to my fitness success!

Thank you, ZUZKA, I look forward to posting my before & after pix on your website in 90 days!

1 MONTH UPDATE: using these DVDs (almost) daily I have improved my physical, mental & emotional health! People are asking me what I am doing to lose the weight, because I look like I am glowing! I have been using Zuzka's workouts & I began to change my eating habits. When I started this lifestyle change last month, I told myself & my kids that we are not going on a diet to restrict certain foods, but that we were going to add healthy foods first, then if we still wanted to eat something that was ""haunting"" us we could. This little ""trick"" has been the key to staying motivated & not feeling deprived! I decided to simply add healthy fresh fruit & veggies to my diet daily by creating beautiful bento box style meals for portion control! My bento boxes are a hit with my kids because they are so cute & yummy! (you can find all kinds of inspiration for creating your own healthy bento boxes on you tube!)

I am so glad I ordered these DVDs, they are THE PERFECT tool for simplified, no nonsense workouts. Consistent use of these DVDs & eating clean WILL ABSOLUTELY YIELD RESULTS!",1360540800,,2869,4.313543599257885

She doesn't pretend she enjoys the torture that we are all going through when pushing ourselves hard, so you don't feel like you're far behind and you push even more.

5528134,5,B00AY5JB92,"This program is so amazing! It has a calendar included that tells you exactly which workout to do which day. There are two more calendars available to print at Zuzkalight.com once you finish the first one. I have completed the first week of the first calendar. I have to say that after workout #2 I waddled around like a duck because I was so sore for the whole next day. I thought about giving it up then, but decided to continue. I'm glad I did because that was the last time I felt that way; my body adjusted. Through these workouts I have been able to push my body in a way I didn't know was possible. I feel stronger and more confident already.

Each DVD has the same warm-up and cool-down on it so that you don't have to worry about switching out the DVD each time. That was well thought out.

During the workouts Zuzka really pushes you and has an uncanny ability to act like she is really there with you personally invested in your workout results. She is very encouraging and smiles a lot.

Zuzka has also has provided additional encouragement & advice on her website encouraging viewers to complete the workout including what she eats before and after.

My biggest tip is DO NOT skip the warm-up & cool-down. Especially the cool-down. Also, drink tons of water (about one gallon per day) because it helps with muscle soreness plus replenishes the water loss from all the sweat that will be dripping off you during each workout.

Another tip-- use two chairs facing each other and do push-ups on an incline with your hands on the chairs and feet on the floor if you struggle. I know she says in the DVD to modify them by only going part way down or going on your knees, but these will allow you to do the full range of motion and are more like a ""real"" push-up than doing them from the knees. (I can do 30+ push-ups from my knees, 5 ""real' push-ups, and 15 incline push-ups in a row to give you a comparison of difficulty).

Conclusion: For this price it would be crazy not to try it! Not nearly as $$$ as some of the more popular at home workout programs and cheaper than a gym membership. No equipment needed!

5528137,5,B00AY5JB92,"If you have taken the time to read the reviews and you are still considering whether or not to purchase ZCUT, I encourage you to go ahead and buy them. If you have tried ZWOWs, you know what to expect and you will not be disappointed.

I'm really a beginner. I've done a handful of ZWOWs online, always with modifications. I'm not the strongest, the fittest, or even close, but the beauty of Zuzka's workouts is that you see results as long as you are pushing yourself.

I have only done 6 ZCUT workouts so far and I am noticing changes. I've gotten more flexible, I'm getting stronger, and I have lost a few pounds.

There are three DVDs in the ZCUT series. Each DVD has a warm up, four workouts, a cool down, and the bonus ab workout. The first DVD has a tracker for the first month and the other trackers are available for downloading at Zuzka's website.

The warm up and cool down are both really excellent. They are the same on each DVD. It would have been nice to have a few different warm ups, but if it's not broke, don't fix it.
The first time I tried the warm up I thought ""Wow, this was pretty much my workout before!"" My husband felt the same way and he's not a beginner. It's challenging at first, but you will notice yourself getting better at it.
I have really neglected cool downs in the past, but this cool down is simple and effective.

The workouts are intense!
There are time challenges, AMRAP, and intervals. Usually, the workouts last under 15 minutes.
Zuzka provides some modifications for the tougher moves.

Reasons to love ZCUT:
*Price - New or used, you won't be able to find another 90 day workout program for this price. At just under $20 including shipping, ZCUT is extremely accessible.
*Personality - Zuzka offers encouragement to keep on and stick it out without being like a drill sergeant. She's actually doing the workout too - she's not starting one move, then going off to talk about it while the people in the background continue to work out. She's amazing at what she does and she's so encouraging that, as a beginner, I'm not finding myself discouraged like I am with the average workout DVD.
*Effectiveness - I'm only 6 workouts in and I'm noticing changes.
*Support - Zuzka is in the process of posting coaching videos to accompany ZCUT and she does her absolute best to respond to every question on her videos, facebook, and website.
*Equipment - You only need yourself, a bottle of water, a chair (occasionally), and a yoga mat. No worrying about weights, resistance bands, or anything like that.",1360540800,,2541,4.537117903930131
5528138,5,B00AY5JB92,I've done a lot of workout videos and this one is the best yet ! They are short high intensity workouts that kick your butt even if you think you are in good shape ! They are perfect for people with a busy schedule but who want to get in shape. If you do these workouts you can't do anything but get in shape! The other nice thing is you don't need special equipment just your body and some ambition ! Love these workouts !,1360454400,,423,3.988235294117647
5528139,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have been following Zuzanna for quite some time on bodyrock.tv and now on zuzkalight.com with her ZWOW workouts and I gotta say she has changed my way of working out so much that I can't even stress enough to describe to you all. And this set of DVDs just took it to the next level. Super intense, fun, short, u don't have to spend hours of working out to get a good sweat, I just love it, I love her, period. So of all u out the that haven't tried it, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking into getting into a good shape without spending a ,or of money and a lot of time.

Zuzana is a great inspiration and I recommend this to anyone, it's not crazy like insanity and you can get the same results. Zcut is the way to go!!!!",1360454400,,308,3.753846153846154
5528141,5,B00AY5JB92,I have followed Zuzka for about a year now and was really excited about being able to get workouts every day from her. The series is really good. I like that she's incorporated warm ups and cool downs into the workout but still has kept everything short and less than thirty minutes. It's not just the normal AMRAP or time challenges either. The tabata workouts are intense because I am so used to having a 10 second rest and she just powers you through without any rest so you really have to stay focused and push yourself. I hope to have some great results once I am done and be able to start the series from the top in 2 months. This isn't about working out to look good it's about working out to look and feel great! Thanks Zuzka!,1360454400,,734,4.25
5528142,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been following the ZWOWs for almost a year now.  I've always been active but have had trouble getting my mid-section and bum to shape up.  Normally it is the first place to gain and the last place to lose.  These workouts have really helped trim my problem areas.  I really haven't modified my diet much (I know I need to) but my shorts and pants fit better and I'm not tugging on my shirts to smooth out the unwanted ridges as much.  ha!  Initially, I was interested in finding a workout that was intense but not long to spare the wear and tear on my joints.  I've essentially replaced 3 days of 30 minutes biking with 10 minutes of Zuzana and gotten much better results.  I knew my arms would shape up (and they really have...hello tank tops!) but I was truly surprised by the results in my abs and butt.  I play a lot of soccer so I think my legs were in pretty good shape already but I'm sure these workouts are helping there too.  My knees aren't the greatest so sometimes I can't do the most intense stuff or dip down as far as Zuzka but I do my best.

I absolutely LOVE the dynamic warm up on the DVD.  Most of the time I think warmups are a waste of good exercise time, but this one is great because I'm still doing strength work while warming up my joints and getting a little stretch in my legs.  It also includes some balance moves that require many stabilizing muscles to be activated.  It is a great transition for me to move from ""I don't feel like working out"" to ""Ready to go!"".  So fa,r I've done workouts 1 - 6.  I do them on days I don't play soccer so I'm not strictly following the calendar but I still really like it and enter my times, how I felt, if I beat Zuzka, etc. I love them as much as the YouTube videos and I like having a defined workout rotation to follow.  Great Job, Zuzka!!

The cool down is also great for me because it includes the stretches I need to do daily anyway to keep my hip muscles from tightening up too much and causing problems for my back.

I can't wait to compare my ""Before"" and ""After"" pictures.  I know I will continue to see results and I plan to shape up my diet with all Zuzka's helpful hints to take me to an even better place.  I'm in my 40s with knee ""challenges"" and it is working for me, imagine how great it will work for you if you are under 35 with working knees!  ha!!",1360454400,,2341,4.110132158590308
5528143,5,B00AY5JB92,This is a great way to get in shape without investing a lot of time. The workouts are very intense but they don't take long time.

5528146,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have been following Zuzanna for over a year and a half now on the internet, first through bodyrock.tv and now through zuzkalight.com.  She is an amazing woman who has an amazing body, and it's great to see how she can stay in shape with such short workouts.  I got into very good shape starting that year and a half ago, and I will never look back.  With these dvds as well as her free online workouts, there is no excuse to not workout because they are so short and accessible.

I have done 2 of her workouts so far, and I watched the other two on the first dvd to just get a taste of what I would be doing in the future.  It is great to see that Zuzanna herself was able to tone up during the making of these dvds over the course of just a few weeks.  I am not the biggest fan of the warm up or cool down, but I don't have to be married to those routines, as long as I warm up and cool down in some way on my own.

As for the lack of soundtrack, I am one of those people who enjoys working out in silence so I can focus on my breath and form, so I like that part of the program.  You won't regret buying these dvds!",1360454400,,1119,3.8347826086956522

I wish the ab bonus was different on each DVD but it is still a really intense workout.  None of these workouts look ""tough"" when you watch the break down -- it's when you do them side-by-side with Zuzana that they become a real challenge.  I also have been doing these with my weighted vest so burpees and push-ups become absolute torture!  I just love Zuzana as a person, I think she is so genuine and down to earth.  I'm really happy with this DVD set!!  If you've done ZWOWs and BR workouts before then you HAVE to get this series!

5528156,5,B00AY5JB92,"ZUZKA is great. The HIIT excercises on these ZCUT Power Cardio DVDS are great. We finally can do these ZUZKA workouts on a tv instead of a computer, so these DVDS are valuable in being able to play them on a larger tv screen. I bet if ZUZKA put a bunch of her Youtube clips onto a DVD that people would buy them too. Maybe eventually these will be included through Amazon for free shipping, but for now the shipping was cheap anyway.

My only issue was the DVD cases. Most DVD cases you press the middle to get the DVDS to pop out, but with these cases when pressing the middle button they are firm and nothing seems to happen. I did not want to try to pull the DVDS out of the cases because that seemed like it could break the DVDS. So, I very carefully pressed each of the three individual tabs in each 3 cases to finally get the DVDS out of the cases, but even that wasn't really easy. I did not want to have to do that every time I took the DVDS out of these cases, so I bought 3 new cases to put the DVDS in. If someone else knows how you are to take DVDS out of cases like these they can explain it in their comment to help others. It may sound silly, but I thought these cases were not easy to remove the DVDS. Maybe the company will find easier to use cases so people don't break any DVDS. Be careful removing the DVDS from these cases.

Thanks to ZUZKA for her genuine nature, her Youtube videos, and these ZUZKA ZCUT Power Cardio DVDS.",1360281600,,1445,4.066666666666666

5528158,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have followed Zuzana's workouts for a couple of years now. If you ever wanted a follow-along workout with Zuzka instead of watching it on YouTube, writing down the moves and going it alone, here it is!  The price is super reasonable. Each DVD contains 4 short, intense workouts as well as the warm up, cooldown and ab bonus. The warmup, et al, are the same on each DVD. Each workout, however, is different. Instructions are carefully given for each exercise.  My daughters and I have been doing them together. My middle daughter has been wearing her heart rate monitor and has been burning between 200 and 300 calories during each workout (including the warmup..we don't always do the cooldown because I teach a fitness class so we do our own cooldown and she reads her monitor before we start).

5528162,5,B00AY5JB92,"I was doing Insanity workout for several years now and think it's one of the most challenging home workout programs on the market. Zuzka with her Zcut program was a great addition to my cardio routine. It challenges my strength and power, especially my legs and shoulders. I think the workouts are a little bit different from her youtube WOWs. Most of them are 12-15 min long, 4-6 exercises each with a great balance of leg/shoulder/core/cardio routine. And if you follow her workouts in order, the exercises do not repeat each other from one day to another.
So, the bottom line -  great workout even for a cardio-fit user.
I had some issues with the DVDs not working on my player, but they were replaced the same week.
For the next edition, I would like to see an option to skip the explanation and combine warm-ups workouts and stretch in one smooth program.

My family and I recently moved away from the city and I can no longer get streaming internet videos at the same quality as before. I've been a healthy person most of my life but could never consistantly stay with a fitness routine bc I got bored or it just took too much of my time.  I can honestly say I haven't had that problem with Zuzana's workouts. They are short and they work.  You get strength, cardio, balance and flexibility all in a 10 -15 min workout.

I was really excited when I found that there will be dvds, because I missed a proper warm up and cool down and to be honest - it is a motivation to work out... if you have your own DVDs, you want to use them :-).
And then I found out, that the amazon shipping was not possible to Europe. Well. That meant that another, more complicated way had to be performed to get them. I used the shipito service, which enables you to get dvd from usa by reforwarding them. And because I wanted them really quickly, the overall cost of shipping was at the end three times the price of dvds.
But I had them home in Czech in six days after ordering from Amazon and I could do my first workout - it was amazing! The warm up is actually a little tougher than I was used to, so with workout number 2 on the next day were my muscles quite (pleasantly) hurting :-).

She has some awkward moves and improper technique and if you aren't aware of this and modify, you could get injured. I have rated the video 4/5 stars b/c the actual physical discs are  of poor quality and the DVD player does not read them sometimes. I don't have a problem with any of the other discs I have.

I am giving the dvds a three. I bought them to show my support because I really appreciate her free youtube videos. I think the whole ""power cardio"" title is a bit misleading though as the routines are really no different than her other routines which are on youtube (if the dvd is power cardio, then the youtube should be called that as well!)

I am excited to have the new routines and would spend the money again even knowing that they are not really any different than her free ones. I want to offer her support as I really love her! I am giving it a three though based on the fact that the description is a bit misleading. The title, and her description of the dvds (on her youtube she talks of them), makes it sound like it is something different than what she already offers.

That being said, if they were described properly, I would give it a 5 as they will help you lean out and gain muscle if you eat well.

I like that she does the entire workout with you and that she struggles too.  Alone one workout is not sufficient enought to challenge an advanced excerciser.  I use these for add ons.  You could also combine the workouts. One negative is there's no music.  I love music to workout to, but you can always add your own.  Also,they are repetitive and may have a bit of a dread factor after a while. I do, love her accent and she's as cute and sweet as can be.  I would recommend them for the price and the intensity.

5528178,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am thrilled with this series! I am on day 5 (of the included calendar) and I am already noticing results. I feel energized, lighter on my feet and more motivated to eat healthy. I have also lost a couple pounds. I have a nine month old (still breastfeeding) so this program is perfect for me because it literally only takes 30 minutes of the day and doesn't require anything but a little bit of open space and sometimes a chair. The workouts, while intense, are easy to modify for any moves that you're not quite able to do. They are so challenging that I imagine there is plenty of room for continual improvement as you get faster and better.

I also love that each workout is different, so no worries about getting bored (or dreading the workout that you know is coming).

The only potential drawback I see is that there are a lot of squats and moves that involve jumping. This might not be the best for someone with knee issues.

I was also amazed at the price! You can't beat a 3 month workout plan for around 15 bucks AND she offers all her health tips and daily workouts on her site zuzkalight.com for free. In order to get that with another company you'd pay over $100.

There is no music, she reviews each move before starting and then goes into the workout.  It's very simple, and you only need to follow along.

5528184,4,B00AY5JB92,"In the past two years, since losing around 90 lbs just by diet alone I've dabbled in exercising; doing something for a month and then quitting only picking something else up a month later. I am not sure when it happened, but I started hating exercise. The thing with exercise videos is that every time I get one, I hope that it will be fun and I'll get hooked. I just didn't have any luck. Buying them will not make you thinner. If only!

When Zuzka said she was coming out with DVDs I was really excited. Each DVD has 4 workouts on it - so 12 in all, a warm up, a cool down, and an ab routine. The warm up and cool down are the same on all of the DVDs. I haven't got to the ab portion yet. The first DVD has the 30 day calendar. You find the other two calendars on her website for download. The calendars have spaces for before and after pictures, your measurements should you choose to take them, as well as tips on eating healthy. Zuzka offers diet tips and recipes on her website and meal ideas on Facebook and Instagram in case you didn't know. (I don't personally use them, but I thought it was an option you should know about.) If you have done any ZWOWs you know what to expect. If not, I would suggest watching one of her YouTube videos all the way through first to see what you're getting yourself into. On each of the workouts she explains the moves and the format for the workout beforehand. She gives tips on form and performs the moves so you can see them. You can fast forward through this to get to the workout if you have done the DVD and seen the moves before.

Pros
After one week of these videos my heart rate was better. I am actually not sure if I can attribute it to the videos or how long I've been exercising consistently now. Probably both. There are exercises I couldn't do a few days ago that I'm able to do now. And I had a pair of pants that were really tight 2 weeks ago and lo-and-behold they went on easily. I lost a clothing size in about a month. Obviously that's working for me.

The workouts are short. The workouts are done and over with before your brain figures out what's going on. There is also no music to distract or annoy you. There are also no other people exercising. So it's just you and Z pushing it to the max. (Some people don't like that but I am too busy working to notice). I think one of the things I like is that she is also pushing as hard as you are. She gets tired; she gets winded. She needs breaks. She's not just telling you what to do, supervising, and then jumping in at the last minute then telling you how hard that was after performing 3 reps. I guess it feels like we're both going to the gym together and working out. When she's working out with me I find that I push harder. It's probably all in my head, but that's how it feels.

Because the workouts are so short and intense you really do forget about everything else and focus on the work in front of you. If you're thinking about something else, you're not pushing hard enough. I get an energy boost mentally and then later physically once I've showered and had some food so it makes it easier to finish things around the house that night.

No equipment or huge amount of space necessary (please see con below about a timer). She suggested a chair for one workout, and maybe like a stack of books or something to jump over. I don't jump very high (yet) so I imagine the books. As for the chair, I used my couch and an ottoman in the living room. You need some space for the burpees.

Because I'm new to this type of exercise I can see that I will be able to continue to progress for a while. My form isn't always that great because I'm so weak and get tired quicker.

I like Zuzka, as her personality comes through the screen. She seems to be genuine. She seems upbeat and happy but not annoyingly so. She's doing the workouts too and between her exertion she's telling you that you can do it and counting down until it's over. There aren't many fitness personalities I would want to hang out with - but she is one. It makes the workouts easier because you feel like you're doing it with a friend.

The price. You can't beat $15. I paid a little extra to have mine shipped sooner, but it was less than $25 total.

Cons
Everyone says these exercises can be modified for beginners. I can do about 10 regular military style pushups, maybe more now. I have to do pushups on my knees with these videos due to sheer amounts of pushups, burpees, etc. There was an exercise I couldn't do that I had to modify that she didn't give the modification for. If I hadn't exercised in my prior life, I wouldn't have known to do that. I've only come across that once.

Another example of a con for being a beginner to the workouts - one workout she has you doing 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest for x amount of minutes (the whole workout). I don't have the stuff to be able to do an entire workout like that. I had to set a timer to go off so I would do 30 seconds of work and 30 seconds of rest (I use a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gymboss-HOT-PINK-SOFTCOAT/dp/B001IYXOS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gymboss HOT PINK SOFTCOAT</a>) I find that I use my timer a lot. For the time challenges she will always finish before me (well, for now) so I have to keep pushing even after she is done. The goal is usually to improve so I need to know when I finish. So while you don't *NEED* any equipment, it's probably smart to have a timer. And if you're doing a lot of pushups on your knees a mat would probably be good too and it can double as something you're jumping over when it's rolled up.

I also wrote down exactly what was in every workout. She moves faster than I do, I need to remember what I am supposed to do since I can't rely on her to tell me. Next to it I usually put some information so that I can best my time next time, or do more reps, or whatever. Also, a few times I wasn't able to complete as many rounds of something as she did - for example, 20 of a specific exercise, I had to only do 10 so I could finish the workout. I did mark this for my own personal information so I can get better next time. I'm telling you this so that if you are a beginner you won't get so discouraged because you need to modify and do less work. Eventually you'll be able to work up to as much as she's doing. It would be nice to have something on the side of the screen so you can see what you're doing. They do flash the exercises on screen before she starts them but sometimes I'm behind by a minute or three.

If you like burpees, you'll be in heaven. There are a lot of them on these videos.

I liked that the first calendar came with the DVDs. The second and third you had to download from her website. I wasn't sure if I cared one way or another about that. If you need physical calendars you'll be upset.

The warm up seems hard to me. Basically a workout before the workout. The cool down is short and decent. Her stretches hit spots that normally I don't get to stretch. What I don't like is that she does a lot of work on muscles she never stretches. I need to stretch everything myself on my own if I feel tension.

After the workout it takes you directly to the menu. I realize this is in case you want to do a workout back to back (if so you are amazing or didn't push hard. I can't decide.) but I think I would have preferred that after the workout it went directly to the cool down video instead of making me walkover to the player and click on it (I use my laptop for these workouts). This seems trivial though since sometimes I walk around a bit and catch my breath before going to the cool down.

Misc. Pro & Con I wasn't sure if I wanted to put these in the pro or con section:

All of her videos are shot in the same space and she's wearing basically the same thing. I really like her personality and think she has an amazing body. It would probably make me as the exerciser more comfortable to play it around kids/family if she dressed with things that covered her a little more. But like I said, most of the time I'm working out and not watching her. Just thought you should be forewarned.

I purchased these to support her because I like what she's doing (both the DVDs and the free YouTube workouts) but also because sometimes we travel and I would want to continue my fitness efforts. I liked the portability, the no equipment workouts, and the 90 day calendar.

Four stars because I like the program but there were a few annoying things, like my requirement for a timer (which I already had, but still). Overall, I really enjoy the DVDs. This was a good purchase.",1359590400,6,8648,4.211352657004831
5528185,2,B00AY5JB92,"This review will not be shameless fan flattery for Zuzka. I am giving constructive criticism so that the DVD series can be improved on and so that people new to Zuzka may have an honest beneficial review.

This series is average at best. There are only 12 different workouts spread through the 3 dvd 90 day program. The price is fair but for a consumer paying for an exclusive new series I would expect said series to be different from what just any person can access on YouTube for FREE. You can literally go on to Zuzkas incredible YouTube page and randomly select any of her various workouts and format that into your own once-a-day workout program. There is no greater benefit to buying the series other than to support Zuzka in a financial method of appreciation.

What I hate: Customer service. I had a question.  Do I do DVD 1 over and over for a full month, or do all three each month.  I emailed customer service, and their response: This is a customer service email for questions specifically about the products sold on zuzkalight dot com.

Please direct all other comments or questions to her Facebook page at *****, where  she love's to hear from her fans.

After doing about 4 of the workouts, I can honestly say that they are amazing and I love them! Zuzka could have charged two or three times as much and I would have paid it. There isn't anywhere else I can get such a great workout in such a short amount of time. I have a really short attention span and I'd rather go hard for 20-30 minutes then go at an intermediate level for 50-60 minutes.

These DVDs certainly do that. As such, I would recommend that you have some athletic ability and aren't starting from scratch. If you are starting from scratch, I would recommend Shaun T's Rockin Body. It's a great at home DVD set.

Thank you Zuzka! Keep rocking!",1359331200,,898,4.3017751479289945
5528196,5,B00AY5JB92,"I first discovered Zuzanna's routines when she was hosting Bodyrock.tv and I became an instant fan.
She's one of those women who you feel is truly beautiful both inside and out.
I like her *tons* better than the new Bodyrock.tv host *AND* there is no equipment necessary for her workouts!
I would suggest that before you buy this DVD set you look at her stuff on YouTube.
It's definitely *not* a program for everyone. I would say that this product is for you if you're mildly fit-advanced. Even when I was in good enough shape to run 10 miles, her workouts would still kick my a** and I believe that despite her good energy and sweet disposition some people might get discouraged very quickly because the workouts on the DVDs are timed and if you can't keep up and keep having to hit pause on the DVD and try it at your own pace because unless you're timing that time too you will probably have a hard time recording and detailing your progress.

I bought the DVDs for two reasons; 1. The WiFi connection at my gym is slow and 2. I wanted to show my support.
She's a well known trainer who is willing to sell THREE of her DVDs for $15, it makes me believe what I said before, she's doing this for the cause and not so much for the money.
I guess the short version is that I would have easily bought this 3 DVD set for $40+ and the fact that she's selling for the low price of $15 makes me want to buy another copy and gift it to a friend.

I did the first workout yesterday. It was great! I would only make two small changes; 1. She should explain the exercise right before she does it. Instead, she goes over all of the exercises before the workout begins. The problem with that is that by that point you've already done the warm up and as she takes a little while to explain, you start feeling like you're cooling off. 2. The first month comes with a calendar (each DVD is a month long program) the second and third month calendar have to be downloaded from her website. However, I can hardly blame her since the DVDs are so cheap.",1359331200,,2033,4.250645994832041
5528197,2,B00AY5JB92,"OK, this review isn't even based on the fact that I ordered the DVDs on January 8 and didn't receive them for 2 1/2 weeks. I saw a ton of others saying the same thing so I didn't inquire about mine. I was anxious to see what they entailed, although I doubted it was nothing more than anyone with internet couldn't see already on youtube from Z's hundreds of other videos over the years. Either way, they were cheap and I've gotten a lot of great workouts for FREE over the years I've watched Bodyrock (when it first started with Zuzana). I followed BR for awhile after Z was gone, but not for long. I'm glad she has her own site now. So what I'm saying is, I can't say I wasted money on these because I've gotten a lot for free from Z and some other great ones over the years. If I were to pay $15 for someone to come wash my car, then I had to wait 2 1/2 weeks for them to show up, only to wash my car with mud....yes, then that I would consider losing money.

OK, so the 1st DVD comes with a poster suggesting what workouts to do on what day. For some reason I assumed each DVD had 12 workouts on it. They don't; each one has four workouts. So 12 workouts in total between three DVDs. OK. Secondly, all three DVDs state there is a 30-day workout poster included. That led me to believe there was one in each DVD. There is not. There is only one 30-day poster in the 1st DVD. I was a little confused when I saw on Z's site a week or so ago where people could download the second and third 30-day posters. That was, of course, before I even got my DVDs in the mail and I just didn't question it because I just don't really care. Also, who was going to answer my question? Other people who ordered their DVDs and also didn't get them? You see the problem...I could figure it out when they got here. There are a million other options for workouts,  plus I don't need someone to hold my hand. Fitness isn't a one-size-fits-all, unwavering sort of set of concrete rules. Like I said, I was just interested to see what was on the DVDs, was hoping for some good workouts, and I like lending support to people I believe have a good message and try to help people.

Back to my DVDs. So I put DVD 1 in, sat through that annoying FBI WARNING and then the other warning that's there to protect against cry-babies who are either sue-happy or have no common sense....You can't fast forward or skip those you know. OK, so that was another 2 minutes of my life. Here we go! I watched the warmup. That played good for me. Then I started having problems. Every time I'd try to go back to the MENU to choose the workout to watch, it was all choppy and breaking up. Intermittently, I'd see the cursor that moves to select what you want to watch. Well, after that happening for about 30 seconds, I finally got it to play Workout 1. Tried going back to the MENU to watch Workout 2, or any other workout on there. There was the warmup, Workouts 1, 2, 3, 4, a cooldown and Ab bonus. Same thing. The MENU was all choppy and kept going out breaking up. A few minutes later, I finally was able to see Workout 2. After that, it was just more of the same thing on the MENU page, only I couldn't (or didn't have the patience) to try to get it to where I could watch anything else.

I thought maybe it was my DVD player. I went through taking that DVD out, putting it back in....of course, then you have to sit through those WARNINGS again. Nope, same thing. I tried another DVD of a random movie. It played fine, MENU and all. OK, so then I put in ZCUT DVD 2. That one wouldn't even go anywhere...not even to the MENU at all. I took it out, back in, nothing. I put in a completely different DVD of a movie I had and it played fine. It was the ZCUT DVDs and not my player obviously. So then I put in ZCUT DVD 3 and it didn't play either. It said disc was unreadable, that the disc wasn't compatible, several different things, but it wouldn't play. I put in several different DVDs I had and they all played fine.

So, after all that waiting, I couldn't even play the DVDs! From what I did see on the 1st disc that played intermittently the workouts were of the exact same type Z has always done in the past. It was nothing new and they may have already been workouts that have already been done by her in the past, or maybe slightly different. The workouts 1 and 2 that I saw on disc 1 were obviously shot on the exact same day, probably one after the other. I'm guessing workouts 3 and 4 were also done on the same day. Which leads me to my next point.....

Somewhere a few weeks ago I saw where Zuzana wrote that when she first started shooting for the ZCUT up to now, her legs have slimmed down and that these workouts helped her do that. Well, if you follow her advise or even the 30-day calendar, you would be doing ONE short, intense workout at a time (not even everyday). Clearly, she was doing more and doing them back-to-back in succession. I do think that one ZWOW, HIIT session or shorter intense workout (whatever you choose to call it) is sufficient to KEEP you in shape for awhile after you are already IN shape, however, it's not going to GET you into the shape that she is in today if you are only doing one 10-12 minute session per day every workout. Even Z or anyone else shooting a workout video...do you think those people just blindly go into a workout as soon as the RECORD button is pushed and that's it? They have most likely done a whole entire test run of that whole workout before they even shoot it, not to mention demonstrating the exercises and giving modification examples. There is a lot of extra exercise just right there. So, there are two clear and perfect instances of where extra exercise is coming from.

So, my DVDs didn't work. As for the two first workouts I did see, they were the same sort of workouts anyone can find from her workouts on youtube or her site. So this is sort of a ""gift set"" or box set, just all in one place and you wouldn't have to get online to watch them.

Also, if anyone wants to buy my DVDs, I'll sell them half price :)

Another thing....What is up with all these people giving 5-star reviews who didn't even get the DVDs yet or watch them? I understand you are a Zuzana fan, but it's a product review, and giving a review of 5-stars no matter what makes it seem a little cultish.",1359331200,25,6317,4.171311475409836
5528198,5,B00AY5JB92,I've gone through the workouts on the first dvd and they were intense as expected. Very lower body intensive which is great for me since that is my stubborn area. Great workout for early mornings if you are short on time.,1359244800,,221,4.414634146341464
5528199,5,B00AY5JB92,"She is great, love these workouts! You are pushed to the max, you get your heart rate up, and you are going to sweat, but intensly satisfying.",1359158400,,142,4.296296296296297
5528200,4,B00AY5JB92,"Little Zuzana will kick your butt with these workouts. I've only done Volume 1 but it was a blast. Did the whole thing back to back. Very interesting and tough stuff! A fair amount of impact but not killer. Consists of warmup, 4 rounds, cooldown and bonus abs. Zuzana demos all the moves in each round so that really kills time. I ff'd thru all the instruction and was able to keep the workout to an hour without missing anything. Lots of burpees, squat jumps, lunge jumps and many more. No real rest in between except for #4 tabata round which was 20 sec on, 10 sec rest.  Looking forward to the next volumes.",1359072000,,610,4.350877192982456
5528201,5,B00AY5JB92,"Discovering Zuzana's ZWOW body weight workouts online was a game changer for me. It was a struggle to find time to workout. Zuzana's system proves that you don't need to spend hours weight training, cardio, etc. I'm in the best shape I've ever been. The ZCUT workout is great! Zuzana delivers the ZCUT workouts with her normal motivational cheer and positive attitude including modifications for those building up their fitness level. These DVDs are a steal! Do yourself a favor. Order.

Thanks Zusana!",1359072000,,502,5.048192771084337
5528202,5,B00AY5JB92,"I have followed Zuzana for a while, but never did her workouts until the DVDs came out.  I really like the format with sections (warm-up, workout, abs, etc), allowing me to skip some sections if I'm in a hurry.  If you are not familiar with her workouts, you should preview her on YouTube and make sure your knees and joints can handle lots of burpees. Her workouts are simple but effective.  There are no crazy dance routines to learn, and you don't need much space. There is no music, which I think is a plus.  I get to blast my sound system and still hear her instructions (I have to mute the cheesy music on other DVDs and sometimes miss the cues). I'm impressed that they are able to sell 3 DVDs at this price!",1358899200,,715,4.274074074074074

Wish I could rate the actual product, but seeing as there are reviews on here rating DVDs that haven't been viewed by the viewer, I am reviewing the HORRIBLE customer service. I can't review the product because I ordered 2 weeks ago and still don't have my DVDs. No word from the company. No replies to countless requests for simply an update. Zuzka has a website, update there for us to see. Broken DVDs arriving, no customer service dealing with that issue either.",1358812800,20,501,4.5777777777777775
5528204,5,B00AY5JB92,Fantastic DVD series!!! I am so happy I  bought it :-) Highly recommended! I have been following Zuzana's workouts for 3 years already but i must say the workouts included on these 3 DVDs are one of her very best. I am looking forward to following this program and enjoying the results,1358812800,,285,4.480769230769231
5528205,5,B00AY5JB92,"So- after only 5 days of Z's new power cardio series (I had to skip two days while I had guests this weekend) I have already gained half an inch in my arm, lost half an inch in my thigh, and half an inch in my waist. IN FIVE DAYS! I'm keeping up with her minute by minute, which I never used to be able to do, and even probably beat her time tonight (workout #5) if I didn't stop for water. I've never done a workout longer than 14 minutes. I love it! It's brutal, but if you can push yourself past those first few workouts, follow her warm ups and cool downs (they really do help with the soreness), you really will see results. Thank you so much Z! I've been a follower since your first video on Charliejames75 and definitely had no problem supporting you on this endeavor. Thank you, again.",1358726400,17,793,4.1558441558441555
5528206,5,B00AY5JB92,"This was my first time doing one of her workouts I had never heard of her before this. I've been working out at home for over 20 years and when I first heard about these and looked her up I was skeptical because of the way she was dressed. I think that turns some people off BUT trust me once you start working out with these you'll be sweating and working to hard to worry about what she's wearing lol. I love these and this is how they break down...3 DVDS with 4 workouts on each of them
Warm up 7 min
workout 10-15 min
abs 8 min
cool down 7 min
It took me about 35 min to finish and trust me you'll be working the whole time even the warm up felt like a workout. Dont let these pass you by for this price (a little over a dollar a workout)you cant beat it and these DVDS are worth way more then that!",1358553600,3,803,3.8727272727272726
5528207,5,B00AY5JB92,"Most of the other 5 star reviews have been following Zuzana for years. Many even as far back as BodyRockTV including myself). They are basing their review on Zuzana's previous work on YouTube which you can look up for yourself. I wanted to wait until I had seen the DVDs and did some workouts before writing this review. It is more of the same and I am still 10,000% satisfied.

What is different from what's already available?

- No internet required - I can do my workouts without my terrible internet connection making me want to throw my TV out my apartment due to freezing (excess adrenaline much?).
- A warm up, cool down and abs workout. These same workouts are repeated on each disk for your convenience so you don't have to switch DVDs in the middle of the
workout. Also, you could leave one DVD at your house lend one to a friend, and keep another in your travel bag if you wanted.
- Production takes place in a studio which makes the video quality a little better. I personally prefer the urban look of her YouTube offerings as it has a sort of guerilla badass vibe to it, but it's no biggie, I'll follow Z anywhere!
- Support Zuzana! Lady has got to make a living somehow and personally I still feel like I'm robbing her at this price. I really must because I accidently bought a second set by accident. Oops. No worries, I'll just give it to my sister.

For the Z uninitiated:

- There are 12 intense workouts lasting approx. 10-15 minutes using your body weight. You do burpees, jumps, lunges, pushups, squats, mule kicks, side kicks, planks.
- At the beginning of each exercise she tells you what's coming by showing you a ""Table of Contents"" of sorts and then breaks it down. It would be nice if that was skip-able. It's not. Once I've learned how to the workout I use that time to start my oatmeal (cook time which is approximately the time of a workout!) or get myself some water, etc.
- Most workouts require no equipment except for the occasional chair or stack of books/crate (something to jump over).
- You can do these workouts in a small space. My roommate and I manage do them on our rug, although we do stagger ourselves occasionally to fit. You can take your DVD to a hotel room while travelling.
- You do not need to be coordinated. These workouts are meant to be simple and require no memorization. Just do your best to keep up with Zuzana.
- Production takes place in a studio and she's the only one
- The 12 workouts are not in any particular order and do not increase in difficulty level (because they are all HARD). Some people may consider that a con. However, to me that means they never lose their usefulness. You don't outgrow them... you just get better at doing the exercise. Zuzana is totally ripped and athletic and you can see even she gets exhausted and has to take a moment every once and a while and ""shake it out""
- There's no music in the DVD which is great because you won't get annoyed by that repetitive track you don't like. Add your own background music if you want. I don't personally.
- Zuzana is a beautiful person inside and out and I love that she keeps it real. She's struggling along with you and she lets you know it. There are no gimmicks, it's all just pushing yourself as much as possible in just 15 minutes so you can get results without spending hours at the gym and around your busy schedule. There is no short AND easy way to get fit.

Things to consider:

- If you prefer to workout longer and put less stress on your body, these are not for you. If regular yoga at the gym or a 5 mile hike is your idea of serious exercise, consider whether you're ready for these DVDs or try a free one on YouTube or her website first.
- If you have disabilities and have back or knee problems and try to avoid high impact activities, this may not be the best workout regime for you.
- Being overweight or out of shape is not something that should stop you. You may need to pause the DVD to catch your breath or modify some of the exercises, but don't let that stop you! Also, what better way to get going than in the privacy of your own home? No one has to see!
- If you don't also consider your diet, then you may not see as much results. Exercise can only do so much.",1358380800,143,4223,4.292346298619824
5528208,5,B00AY5JB92,"I love how each exercise is thoroughly explained before starting. These workouts are very quick and intense so theres really no time to get bored or watch the clock! It doesnt take long to feel stronger and more fit from this type of workout; and even though weights are not used, I bet many men would find it a challenge to keep up with Zuzka! Like her shirt says, she is a WARRIOR!",1358294400,,383,4.260273972602739
5528209,5,B00AY5JB92,"I don't usually write reviews, but this one deserves it!

First of all, Zuzana is great.  Have been a Bodyrock fan for a long time.  The new site is evolving and OK and all that.  Lisa is also cool.  Nevertheless the site is definitely missing Zuzana's charm.  One thing I really like is her low-key personality.  Soft-spoken, yet full of encouragement.  None of that pretentious non-sense from so many other TV/net personalities.  Watching her video, you can hear her breathing and tell she is giving all she got during each exercise, and be truly motivated by the high-intensity workout routine.

Don't be fooled by her slim figure.  It's all lean muscle, combined with incredible flexibility.  I won't be too surprised she ever does some kind of kickboxing on the side..

Going back to the DVDs, here are two reasons you should buy them!

(1) Support Zuzka.  You can't really expect everyone to do everything for free forever, right?  We all need to make a living somehow.

(2) It's just plainly cheaper to buy the DVDs for $15 or so than trying to download it from Youtube.  I did download some or most of them from Youtube.  But it's such a pain in the neck and time consuming.  I would have bought them in a heartbeat if they were available.  Look at it this way.  Even at the federal minimum wage, $15 means about two hours of work.  Trust me, it will take you much more than two hours to track down the videos and download them, even if you have blazing fast internet access.

Lastly, Zuzka is still new in this venture.  She needs our support.",1358208000,7,1552,4.536231884057971
5528210,5,B00AY5JB92,"First I want to say that I have been following Zuzana for a little over two years, and as a seasoned athlete I have never been more inspired by any other trainer.

 Zuzana has a way about her that is incredibly warm and genuine. She relates to her audience like a true friend and I believe wholeheartedly that Zuzana cares deeply about her fans and their health.
I received my DVD set yesterday and could not wait to do my first workout this morning. It was extremely intense and took only 10 minutes to complete. Many would be dismayed at the idea of a 10 minute workout producing incredible results, however I can say from experience that Zuzkas workouts will get you into the best shape of your life. They are dynamic and effective and Zuzka is a joy to behold as an inspiring trainer!
I can't wait to see my transformation at the end of the 90 days! Thank you Z!!",1358208000,5,867,4.345679012345679
5528211,5,B00AY5JB92,"The three DVD's have 4 full workouts each (and by full I mean - in addition to the 'now usual' set of exercises, reps and form that Zuzka shows you in the youtube video,  she is taking you though every single repetition every run through!  At the same time, you will recognize Z's style - no sound over, no perfected cuts, but very real work and real personality.  I think this will come down to personal preferences - it can either distract you or encourage you to stay real in your own journey to a fit body.

You will find a warm-up video that you can and will be encouraged to start with and a choice of 4 workouts to choose from on each DVD.  A cool-down option follows, along with a bonus abs workout.

An overall great extension to the work Zuzanka introduced!",1358208000,13,767,4.291666666666667

I can't wait to see where these 90 days take me!!

Many fans of Zuzka are also aware that she spent a part of her youth as an erotic model in Eastern Europe, an abusive world she escaped from and would like to help other European girls escape from. This is part of Zuzanna's story and at some point I would like to see her openly address it, even a part of her web site, perhaps set up a rescue service for the other girls in CZ and elsewhere. I would be willing to help support something like that financially and so would many others.",1358121600,3,732,4.083333333333333

thank you Zuzana!! you are truly inspirational!!!",1358121600,2,322,4.75
5528215,5,B00AY5JB92,"All of Zuzana's workouts are challenging, fun, creative, quick and most of all - effective.  But you have to be willing to DO them and listen to her simple diet and attitude suggestions, too, otherwise you're probably just watching them because she's truly an amazing person to behold and learn from.  REgardless, I've found that doing her ZWOW workouts right with her as I play the video helps me push myself harder, so I reap better results.  Its also encouraging to witness that she can make mistakes, lose her balance, lose count .. BUT, that, along with being given 'permission' to do MY best, helps me to not just try to copy her till I hurt myself.  I find it personally effective to aim to do all the reps of each exercise she's doing, but to stop when she ends each exercise so that I know how many I can actually do in comparison to her. By the next round of that exercise, I keep pushing to do all of them, again, and can tell if I've improved.  For example, she might say ""10 burpees,"" and I can only do 7 before she's done with the 10. I stop when she stops and move on to the next exercise. When we come back around to more burpees, I usually improve and can often do 10.  I end at the same time she ends her routines so I can tell exactly where I need to improve, in which exercises.

Overall, in the past 7 months I have gained a lot of strength, I  feel pulled together, tighter, leaner and more willing to challenge myself instead of taking the easy paths put before me.

Certainly, having the DVD's will have the same effect and I look forward to the continuing improvements I've made over the past 7 months.",1358035200,5,1627,4.290849673202614

Her personality alone is SO motivating. She knows what she's talking about and she has an AMAZING body, and yet she is extremely humble and genuinely down-to-earth. If ANYONE can help guide you through getting fit, it's Zuzka. She is the best friend everyone wants. BUY THESE DVDs and you'll fall in love with her grace, expertise, and your transforming body.

Her sincerity makes you love her. She simplifies everything. There's no gimmicks or easy way outs, it's just eating clean and exercising.

Still give it 5 stars.  I have the DVD's now and LOVE them. Already seeing results. I am not able to workout like she does however I give it my all in hopes that someday I will get there.  The calendar shows you which workout # to do on each specific day. During the first month you will use all 3 discs. If you go to her website Zuzkalight.com she shares with you her nutritional practices. She is also blogging on her website each day as she is currently working this program from beginning to end. I find her style keeps me motivated and going. I feel like I'm working out with a friend instead of watching a Hollywood personality fake their way thru it. Some people comment about no music on the DVD's. I personally prefer that. Chances are not everyone would be motivated by someone elses music choices.",1357689600,2,1079,4.279411764705882

Like many people, I have struggled with the time I'd spend working out ineffectively or spending money on a monthly gym membership that didn't seem worth the investment.  Once I finally found Zuzana, I had a workout that was short (so I didn't get bored), intense (so I couldn't fake my way through it) and gave me RESULTS!  I am 40 years old and I have the BEST body I have ever had!  I will be continuing to follow her workouts on her website in addition to the DVD workouts.  I purchased these DVDs as soon as they were available as a way to support her and thank her for all the free workouts she has selflessly shared with the world.

5528227,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been doing Zuzana's workouts for a few years (ever since she helped co-found Body Rock TV), and they are fantastic!  The amazing thing is that they are short and time-efficient, and they mostly just use your body weight.  Zuzana's (whose nickname is Zuzka, which is why you'll see her name both ways) first-ever DVD set is geared towards advanced exercisers, but if you start off at your own pace, you can build up to the harder moves.

This new set of three DVDs contains 12 all-new workouts and a bonus abs workout. The DVDs are pressed DVDs, and not DVD-r, so they are good quality.

These body-weight workouts require only minimal equipment -- a chair, a mat, and (optional) a stack of books to jump over for some of the lateral jump moves.  There is a countdown timer to keep you motivated, and some very basic and quick nutrition tips are also included on the rotation calendar. The main portion of each workout ranges between 10-15 minutes long.

There is one warm-up (just under 8 minutes) and one cool-down (just over 7 minutes) included that you do each day you work out, and that you just tack on to the day's workout.  (It is the same warm-up and cool-down that you do every time you work out, for all three months of the program.) If you do the warm-up, one workout, and the cool-down, each workout should take you just about 25-30 minutes total.

The exercises consist of Zuzana's signature moves -- things like burpees, tuck jumps, pistol squats, etc.  They are pretty high impact, but that intensity definitely helps you get results in a short period of time.

Zuzana also does a demo of some of the exercises before the workout starts, so you can see what's coming and how to do it.  The demos are a few minutes long and are at the start of each workout.

This set also comes with a calendar/rotation to follow for the first month so you know exactly where/how to use the DVDs.  For the second and third months, you can go to Zuzana's website and download a rotation schedule.  If you follow the rotation calendar, for the first month, you work out 5 days a week, and for the second and third months, you work out 6-7 days a week.  The calendar is pre-set, but she said that you can add more cardio to the program, although you should still expect to see results even if you don't.

Also, there is no music in any of the workouts, so it might be good to have an iPod or other MP3 player handy if you like to listen to music (as I do) when I work out.

Some of Zuzka's YouTube videos feature suggestive camera angles, which I know is problematic for folks who have children.  On these DVDs, she does wear a low-cut top in most of the workouts, but the camera angles are more ""conservative,"" for lack of a better word.

On her Twitter feed and a video on her blog, Zuzanna mentioned that she filmed these workouts over the course of two weeks, and in that time her lower body really slimmed down.  If you look at the difference in her legs in the workouts filmed earlier and the ones filmed later, you can see a marked change; these will definitely help your legs trim up.

She also mentioned on her Twitter feed that you don't need to do any additional workouts if you do these.  Supposedly Zuzana herself only works out 3-5 days a week doing her workouts, and she's in amazing shape.  I know that diet is 80% of the equation, but these type of high intensity workouts really do get fast results.  (She also mentioned that she's working on a cookbook, and I'm already looking forward to when it comes out!)

I'm planning on adding these on to my usual workouts (which is how I've always used them -- as add-ons to other workouts I do), and will update my review after I've used these for a bit.

UPDATE ON 1/25/13:  Someone asked in a comment about how to cycle through the workouts, so I thought I'd add that into my review as an update.  Basically, each disk has four workouts on it, and you use all 12 workouts the first month.

The calendar that comes inside of Disk 1 shows you what exercises to do the first month, and what order to do them in. You basically do the 12 workouts in order, but the rest days are spaced out throughout each week, so that you're working out five days a week the first month. Once you get to Workout 12, you start over at Workout 1 again and keep going for the rest of the month.

It doesn't seem like she's posted the second and third month calendars on her website yet (or at least, I haven't been able to find them), but hopefully they'll be up soon.

Also, it seems like a lot of people are still waiting on their DVDs to arrive, and Zuzka posted something on her Facebook page about how they received several thousand orders, and are trying to keep up with the demand. The tracking info isn't great right now and I know they're taking a long time to arrive, but this is a great set that really is worth the wait.  I've noticed that I'm getting better cardio endurance, and can do plyo moves more easily since I started adding these on to my other workouts.

UPDATE ON 1/27/13:  On her website and Facebook page, Zuzka stated that on February 10, she'll be offering daily check-ins and motivation if you want to start the 90-day rotation that day.  (I imagine that she's waiting until then since many folks who ordered the first week are still waiting on their DVDs.)

She's also started putting up some diet and nutrition videos/info, and, starting this week, she's been posting her daily meal plans.  Since they say that diet is 80% of your results and Zuzka is in amazing shape, I'm excited that she'll be doing this since I'm really curious about what she eats to look as amazing as she does.

UPDATE ON 5/25/13:  Just as an FYI, Zuzka just posted a photo on her Facebook page of her next set -- the Power Strength Series, and it's supposed to be out on May 31.  From the descriptions on the cover, it looks like it will be 12 strength workouts that are designed to ""boost your strength and thin your body.""

UPDATE ON 9/6/13:  Someone asked me about the cost in the comments section of my review, so I wanted to mention here that these should only cost about sixteen dollars + four dollars shipping from Watch It Now Entertainment (as sold through Amazon), which is the company that produces and sells all of Zuzana's workouts. The other retailers who are selling this set for exorbitant prices are just taking advantage of consumers.

On a different note, someone on a fitness forum I'm active on mentioned that when she moved from doing hour-long workouts to just doing 2-3 ZCut workouts a day (mostly the strength ones), she was able to drop weight and is now, at 52, in the best shape of her life.  I've been using these workouts mostly as add-ons to other workouts I do, but that post inspired me to start using my ZCut workouts more!",1357689600,229,6803,4.412329863891113
5528228,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am Beyond Excited to just purchase this 3 workout dvd for less than $20. What an amazing deal!!

I first was introduce to Zuzana while surfing YouTube and came across Bodyrocker. Fell in love with her approach to working out. I am a long devoted fan and follower. Since her leave from Bodyrocker. I followed her, to her new site Zuzkalight.com to get all my Zuzana Fitness information. I still continue to watch her workout on Youtube.

It is the type of work out that will get you results with the just a few moves. You don't need to dedicate 40 min of your time to get the result you want. Also, you do not need a lot of equipment. Most her workouts now require either, your body, chair, dumbbell and a mat or towel. There isn't much time for a full time Student, Working Single Mommy. So I enjoy that her workouts are short and intense.

Trust me, you are getting a great Deal. This is worth so much more. She Deserve so much more for being such a wonderful person. Thank you Zuzana for doing such an amazing job.",1357603200,4,1018,4.291666666666667
5528229,5,B00AY5JB92,"I just ordered mine!! I have been doing Zwow workouts since October of last year and I can't begin to tell you what amazing results I've got. Not only is she a down to earth person but the way she explains her workouts makes it so easy for any one to do. Remember if it doesn't challenge you it doesn't change you! It's perfect for men and women and especially moms! Her workouts are (HIIT) Hight intensity interval training and they are very effective and don't require many hours in the gym or all sorts of crazy equipment. You will mainly use your body weight and in occasion dumbbells. If you don't believe me check out bodyrocking mommy on instagram.com progress pics don't lie! So don't waste any time in ordering your DVD,I promise you that you won't be disappointed!!=)",1357603200,3,777,4.557142857142857
5528230,5,B00AY5JB92,"4/15/2013 - I still stand behind my review. My initial feedback was spot on.

Most of all this purchase was made to express my gratitude for all that you have done Zuzana. I have been an avid and proud follower since your very first videos. My wife has joined me too and we both work out together with you. You can't tell she is a mother of two :)

Based on your youtube videos, I have no doubt this series will kick our butts! And the price, really, how will you make anything here?

Thank you for being a true sport!",1357603200,11,518,4.108910891089109
5528231,5,B00AY5JB92,"I don't even know where to begin. This is my first ever amazon review and I am extremely proud to say that it's on Zuzana and her new workout DVD set. I've been following her for a few years doing workouts here and there. Her life story is amazing and she is one of the sweetest, realest fitness personalities out there who has a heart of gold and really just wants to make fitness and lifestyle changes available and accessible to ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY. No matter who you are, where you are, what you look like; regardless of age, gender, race, sex, weight, etc. etc. Following her will change your life in so many different ways and best of all, it's almost all free! Which just goes to show you how much she really cares about getting people healthy and changing the way we think about health and fitness. I am so glad I can support her by purchasing this set, and can I please just reiterate HOW CHEAP THIS IS FOR AN AMAZING PROGRAM?! I am a poor grad student and I can't even describe how freaking glad I am that I can buy this DVD program + shipping for LESS THAN $20.

Also, quick-under-20 minute workouts? YES PLEASE.

Thank you, thank you, thank you Zuzana from the bottom of my heart!!!!",1357603200,30,1197,4.36322869955157

5528233,5,B00AY5JB92,"I've been following her workouts on You Tube for months and she really won me over ! She is a real, honest person, not some fake trying desperately to sell as many copies as possible. I believe in he rand her workouts. They are short but very intense and combine cardio and strength. Excellent idea and really greatly executed by Zuzka.
I haven't yet seen this DVD series but I will buy it and rate it 5 stars because her You Tube videos over the last year made me very excited and eager to see entire 90-day program and because her work on You Tube alone deserves 5 stars.
We are very grateful to you Zuzka and you and your work are 10 stars !!! Keep on the good work girl !",1357603200,9,675,4.121212121212121
5528234,5,B00AY5JB92,"Wootie! Just take a few minutes to check Zuzka out on youtube, and your qualms will be obliterated. I purchased the set in part as a thank you for all the work Zuzka has already done for countless viewers.
It's a bit forward to instantly rate the product with 5 stars before seeing it, but that rating is based off her previous work.
Just beware: IF you follow her advice, your life will be changed ...and you might have to go clothes shopping soon, or at least start wearing a belt ;) So start saving for those new jeans the moment you order these DVDs!",1357603200,16,554,4.285714285714286
5528235,5,B00AY5JB92,"I am so glad Zuzana has came out with this workout DVD. I followed here on Youtube for so long and my first time working out with her I lost a total of 65lbs and that was after 3 children, Stair-steppers at that, then I could not find her anymore and now just recently after I put on more weight, I have found her again and better yet she has a 90 day program for a new healthier lifestyle!!! I am so happy!!!
For anyone wondering on whether or not you should buy this item, don't wonder, this will be the best decision you can make in 2013 and the BEST WORKOUT DVD EVER!!!! They are short and very effective. I love to workout so I am going to do my first month with her, then on my second and third month, I will do her in the Morning and alternate between Turbofire and Insanity. Then afterwards I might try P90X. But that is just me. Zuzka's workouts are known for getting you, regardless of age or size, the body that you want. Trust me!
I am going to come back and make a video in 60 days and have my before and after picture up, just to prove a point that Zuzka's workouts are THE BEST EVER!!!!!!",1357603200,5,1103,4.064220183486238

Now I just use her workouts when I can, started tracking my micros and lost an additional 4 pounds in one month!
