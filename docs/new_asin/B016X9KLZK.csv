7481128,1,B016X9KLZK,We thought this had the potential to be like Lemony Snicket. But this lacks a story line and atmospherically falls short.,1451088000,,121,4.809523809523809
7481129,3,B016X9KLZK,"I went into this viewing it as a family movie, rather than adult fare. Having watched many an independent or foreign fantasy children's film, the style of The Games Maker was overall - well done. It has a whimsical storytelling embrace, like Willy Wonka meets Madeline, or something Roald Dahl would have penned. I am also reminded a bit of the narrative voice in Adam Sandler's Bedtime Stories. While The Games Maker was slow in places, and the action cusps were sometimes too abrupt or too thin (I would have preferred greater depth in the writing and character portrayals), it works for young viewers who aren't looking for such deep explanations. And there was enough of the ""bizarre"" to hold my attention. I kept expecting a Johnny Depp cameo... (no, he was not in this film, though he would have been right at home).

The Games Maker flows like how a child might dream, and the visuals reflect that atmosphere - offering subtle hints of oddity, stark degradation, and broad vistas of adventure. It's a quirky mix of perceptions as young Ivan Drago finds his secret legacy and his life's destiny, while challenging his family's child-like nemesis (the Morodian), ably played by Joseph Fiennes. I've seen one reviewer make the Harry Potter analogy for this movie, and I disagree. Yes, there is a series of boarding school misadventures after his parents disappear, but not in the Harry Potter sense, and that's not a bad thing. Ivan must escape his prison-like school to find his grandfather, and we are treated to a layered surreal story within a story that connects his fate. However, please adjust your expectations away from Hollywood... this is not a movie of intensity, or explosions or of a grand climax. The plot challenges are suitable for a child, and for an imaginative world that borders on magic, and yet the content is textured enough to strike subtle chords with adults.

An aging Ed Asner as the grandfather was appreciated and apropo to the cursed city of Zyl, and was also necessary to not overshadow our young Ivan Drago, who is truly the star of this movie. A word of praise should also go to his heroine counterpart - Megan Charpentier as Anunciacion - who despite almost no back story, made the best of her role.

Parental Advisory: No sex or nudity, no curse words, no blood... really, there's almost nothing I can think of that would be a problem for children, except that they might not fully appreciate the layered writing. The focus on games and creativity was wonderful, and though given a dark taste through the Morodian, I'd be surprised if your children (or you) didn't end the movie without delightfully suffering the pang of some inspiration to invent your own board game. Fortunately, there's no digital aspect to this cinematic vision... that would have diminished the story, but the concept of game creation certainly carries over to that frontier.

On my Independent/Foreign Film rating scale, which is more forgiving than Hollywood, this is a solid 3 out of 5 stars.",1450742400,7,3008,4.834951456310679

7481131,4,B016X9KLZK,"What a fun ride! I had never even heard of this film, but the cover looked cool, so I said ""what the hay"" So glad I did. My kids liked it too. It's a bit predictable, but you still need to pay close attention, there is a LOT to miss. No multitasking!!",1458000000,,251,3.8461538461538463
7481132,3,B016X9KLZK,"My 6-year-old son liked this movie, my 4-year-old daughter did not. I thought it was okay, but a little weird and disjointed. It seemed to me like they made a list of the most popular quirky kids movies (Harry Potter, Jumanji, Willy Wonka, James and the Giant Peach, Spy Kids), took their favorite scenes and put them all together into one movie. This movie is not greater than the sum of their parts however. If you're looking for something new to watch with the kids, you can give it a try, but don't expect too much from it.",1456099200,4,527,4.387755102040816

7481138,5,B016X9KLZK,"We loved this! Great world building, beautiful costuming, unique premise.  It was like Harry Potter meets Jumanji meets Ender's Game, but so much better! Very feel good plot, great acting, just amazing sets.  Highly recommend for a Fantasy fix that is fun for the WHOLE family!!!",1451347200,,279,5.043478260869565
7481139,1,B016X9KLZK,"This movie fell far short of my expectations.  I thought from the movie description that this movie had a great potential but it was boring, and hard to follow.  The story line missed many opportunities to build the plot and the characters.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1451347200,,285,4.66
8737504,1,B016X9KLZK,The description does not tell the true tone or feel of the movie.  Nor does the cover reflect the dark/creepy aspect.  It looked and sounded like a fun adventure.  It turned out to be dark and really complicated and too scary for my kids. Don't watch it.,1500422400,,254,4.361702127659575
8737505,5,B016X9KLZK,"Amazing movie. Beautifully creative, great acting, unique style. It creates a consistent universe of its own where each element connects with and interacts with the other elements of the movie. Nothing disrupts the integrity of the movie: no stupid funny pets or comic relief characters, no American slang. Linguistics stay refreshingly neutral. Its comic and cartoonish moments are perfectly consistent with the particular tone, atmosphere and internal logics of the movie. It builds a place of its own that is not betrayed by a specific culture, idiosyncracy or agenda. In short, it has all the elements I like to see in a movie of this genre.",1497139200,,645,5.09433962264151
8737506,1,B016X9KLZK,"We just weren't too happy with the material in this movie. For our beliefs, it just wasn't suitable. There was a lot of magic, eerie, hidden meaning symbols. I really should have checked it out before I purchased it. Others might enjoy it, but, it wasn't for my child or our family.",1476576000,4,282,4.4423076923076925
8737507,1,B016X9KLZK,"Felt like a boring, cold and soulless Harry Potter ripoff. You watch it and find yourself saying, ""oh, that character is like so-and-so"" from Potter, while finding nothing really redeemable from this mess, other than Ed Asner who is briefly amusing. Otherwise this was terrible.",1473206400,,278,5.2
8737508,2,B016X9KLZK,Begins interestingly enough then peters out and becomes very boring. Would not recommend spending time on this one.,1469923200,,115,5.444444444444445
8737509,2,B016X9KLZK,"It has alot of potential that wasn't realized.
 David Mazouz & Joseph Fiennes are good and the production quality is good too, but something goes awry 1/2 way through the movie when
 Ed Asner pops up. He just isn't a good fit for this movie. From then on, things seem to be untightly wielded together & uninteresting. The beginning is lyrical & full of wonder & mystery ( gentle like a  Gortimer Gibbons on Normal street episode ) but then it turns dark, like the Harry Potter movies, but with the goofiness of Spy kids (the 2nd & 3rd movies)
For some reason it just doesn't have them momentum though & your interest peters out",1466812800,2,627,4.434782608695652
8737510,4,B016X9KLZK,"This is a fantasy movie that reminded me a lot of Jumanji crossed with Harry Potter.  It's a family movie, but will be over the head of littler kids.  It's the story of Ivan, a boy who is around 10 to 12 years old.)  His father wants him to be athletic, but Ivan prefers indoor activities.  Dad forbids Ivan to play any board games ever.  Ivan secretly enters a game making contest.  Then Mom & Dad disappear in a lost hot air balloon; are they really dead?  Ivan is sent to a horrible boarding school, but his grandfather -- a board game inventor-- sends him clues to help him escape.  You will have to suspend your need for logic and reality to enjoy this one--I'm thinking about the sinking school which is pretty far-fetched.  Honestly, this is not my type of movie, but I gave it four stars because I think a lot of older kids (tweens) will really like it.  We have it in the library where I am the children's librarian, and it gets checked out a lot.  It's hard to find movies for the tween set, so we're happy to have this one.",1465776000,,1034,4.224489795918367
8737511,4,B016X9KLZK,"The Games Maker was a nice children's/family film. David Mazouz was his usual incredible performer. The sets were particularly notable. The story was good. It is a shame this film did not get wide distribution in the US.

I enjoyed watching, and intend to watch again several times. It is perhaps on a par with Hugo. I would recommend others purchase this DVD as well for their home libraries.",1465430400,,393,4.695652173913044
8737512,4,B016X9KLZK,Fun movie to watch.,1464393600,,19,4.0
8737513,5,B016X9KLZK,I loved this movie. It is the story of Ivan Drago who is a junior games maker. This movie has similar elements to the 1995 movie called Jumanji in which there is a board game that is played. I loved David Mazouz who played the part of Ivan Drago. This movie had elements borrowed from other movies like the 5000 Fingers of Doctor T (1953) Tommy Rettig who played the part of Bartholomew Collins; Hugo movie (2011) with Asa Butterfield as Hugo. and Tom Brown's School Days 1951 with John Howard Davies as Tom Brown. The elements that have been borrowed are riddles; a child that lives behind the walls; a bully; and an egomaniacal man. This movie is a fine boy adventure film and I enjoy seeing it many times.,1458345600,,708,4.412213740458015
