The plot and the overall movie was good,but it didn't make much sense how at the first Charley Wilson said that her mom always told her it didn't matter what you had it mattered what you are on the inside. Thats great,but through the rest of the movie she was absorbed in Charlie having all the right clothes. She seemed to contradict herself. Like when Alonzo(the local farmer)brought Charley back from her first time at Church,Rachel,Charlie's mother said ""You went in those clothes!""By the way,Charlie had never been to church because her parents were ashamed that they were so poor! It is a good movie still though.",1155168000,,717,4.609375
7905192,5,B000007R00,"Charley Wilson (Raeanin Simpson) is a poor girl who is snubbed by society and has few friends. Among her only friends are her dog, Fuzz, and the paperboy, Fritz (Lance Johnson). However, she desperately wants to fit in with girls of her own age. She tries to befriend a classmate, but is rejected by the cruel and wealthy mother. Eventually, Charley is befriended by a local farmer named Alonzo (Keith Christensen). It is this friendship with Alonzo that puts Charley and Fuzz to a test of the love for Alonzo. When faced with a life-or-death situation, Charley and Fuzz show that all it takes is a little courage and a lot of heart to make miracles happen. This is a heartwarming movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family.
Based on the childhood of the director's wife, this is a wonderful family film. Although it lacks many of the special effects that movie buffs have come to expect, Little Heroes provides a wholesome look how even some of the most unlikely people can accomplish amazing things.",1004400000,,1005,4.68361581920904
