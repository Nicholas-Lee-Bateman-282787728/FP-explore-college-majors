7996511,5,B0000AC8M7,"Please do not judge this film based on a person who ordered the incorrect item and then decided to rate this item a 1 due to their error.  This is the Kurosawa fim featuring a young Toshiro Mifune.  It's a great film, not on par with the classics like Red Beard, Rashoman or Seven Samurai and many others, but it's an excellent portrait into the beginning of Mr. Kurosawa's genius.  This is an import and is not a digitally restored or cleaned up version, so if you have Criterion expectations you will be disappointed.  Just watch this film for what it is, the only DVD version of this film (at the time of my writing this) and enjoy it for that.  The subtitles are not particularly well done, but you may find some amusement in them as I did.  If you're a Kurosawa fan, check it out, and if you have really high expectations this may be worth passing on.",1189468800,2,856,4.31875
