5335578,5,B009H3LONI,"As Chris Dreja says "" You either have it or you don't""  this one has it. The band took their razor-sharp no-frills blast of raveup yardmerizing music to the stage in 2011 and delivered. Jim McCarty and Chris Dreja put one heck of band together with Ben King on lead guitar, Andy Mitchell on vocals guitar and Dave Smale bass and vocals.  From the opening notes of I'm not talkin to the final of I'm a man.

This fifteen track dvd a treasure chest of rock and blues showcases the talents and skills of guitarist Ben King.  Make no doubt about this is about as real as it gets.  Making Tracks, will conjure up fond memories of great songs like Shapes of Things,Hearful of soul and For your love.  For myself nuggets like drinking muddy water, Lost woman, Think about it and yardbirds centerpiece of the 1968 tour Dazed and confused come off fresh and new.

The new flock comes together like never before with Five Long Years a crowd favorite from the tour.  The interplay of Jim McCarty, Ben King and Andy on this one with Dave Small holding down the bottom makes you think about it.  I also add that Mystery of being from their Birdland really come alive. Nice treat to Andy Mitchell not only sing but put on acoustic guitar.

I have the double cd limited edtion version.  The real treat if you can find it is the bonus cd that contains The yardbirds perhaps at their most experimental with a live version of Glimpses! The video that accompanies it is perfect.  Hey Ben I wish I got to hear more of your acoustic playing! ,is my only complaint but you do get a glimpse into that world with the bonus cd.  Jim McCarty and Chris Dreja just raised the bar yet again with this wonderful glimpse into the future.

PS Happy 50th guys!  enjoy",1358467200,5,1734,4.391849529780564
5335579,4,B009H3LONI,"I was literally ""along for the ride"" on the tours that this was filmed on. It is an honest document of what The Yardbirds sound like today and how the fans continue to react to this band. There is a great deal of love and respect for this music and those lucky enuff to see this line-up in small clubs and theaters around the U.S. should consider themselves fortunate. Of historic note this may very well be Chris Dreja's last tour. Chris suffered a minor stroke at the end of the 2011 tour and has not returned to the road since. The Yardbirds did tour in 2012 with only Jim McCarty remaining as an original member. Ben King is a worthy succesor to all the great guitarists that have graced The Yardbirds. Dont even begin to think of this line-up as some bogus tribute band...because that aint the case. Dave Smale is the overlooked gem of the line-up. Bass with an attitude. He is ""The Face On The Bass""...lol Andy Mitchell is a real front man in the old Yardbirds style. He stands up there and wails away and has mastered the harmonica as well. No one can replace Keith Relf and Andy doesnt try. He is his own man. Buy this DVD and see what I mean. What can we say about McCarty and Dreja? Only that they are the only two musicians on the planet to play in the same band with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. That's good enough for me. Nuff Said.

5335580,5,B009H3LONI,"Original members Chris Dreja and Jim McCarty get some young bucks to join the historic band for a 2 year tour. This dvd shows them in a series of different gigs.

8541569,5,B009H3LONI,"Hey, none of us are getting any younger. Only 2 Yardbirds are featured in this DVD. Drummer Jim McCarty and Chris Dreja. McCarty is the best he's ever been. (I can judge, I'm a drummer). Dreja's rhythm guitar remains faithful to the original songs. They brought in some young guys on vocal, lead guitar and bass. The vocalist hold his own, sounding like a young Keith Relf. The
lead guitars does a great job staying true to the original interpretations of Clapton, Beck and Page.

Any Yardbirds fan will be happy to own this DVD. It's amazing how fresh the music has remained.",1402963200,,576,4.592233009708738

8541571,4,B009H3LONI,"I know the Yardbirds since the early 60s. I liked them with Clapton, Beck, and Page, some of the greatest guitarists of all time. I, and I'm sure all Yardbirds fans, miss Keith Relf, and of course, Paul Samwell Smith on the bass. I also miss the three lost decades of what would be Yardbirds music. Yes, of course Box of Frogs this and Box of Frogs that and Reunion here and Reunion there, but those are not what I am talking about. Fortunately, thanks to Jim McCarty's tireless efforts, they came to life in 2003 with the Birdland CD. And what a Yardbirds CD it was. The style is definitely Yardbirds, even though Jim McCarty is the only original member beside Chris Dreja. Jim McCarty is the real Yardbird. He is a writer on almost all of the songs. My favorite of his partly- and fully-composed songs are The Shapes of Things, Over Under Sideways Down, Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor, Crying Out for Love, Mystery of Being, Dream Within a Dream, etc. But now this new phase of the group, who performs on this DVD, is the real thing. The Yardbirds have never sounded better and heavier than now.  I like the touch of heavy metal infusion on For Your Love and Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor. They should put this infusion into more of the new songs. Again, Jim McCarty is excellent on this new drum set. You really can tell who is behind the Yardbirds (although I sometimes have a hard time recognizing who is drumming, Jim or Joe). Chris Dreja, God bless you, and recover soon so you can play. Ben King, you are giving a life to this band like Joe Gouch to Ten Years After. Andy Mitchell makes me forget the legendary Keith Relf. Dave Smale, what can I say? I say, watch and listen. Audio - 5 stars, Video - 2 stars, I still give 4 stars. This band well deserves it, and every music lover deserves a copy of this DVD. My recommendation is that with or without Chris, the Yardbirds ought to and must go to the Royal Albert Hall and record another live DVD.

My suggestion for something that would make the concert more exciting... Saxon has the eagle landing and Iron Maiden has Eddie. The Yardbirds should hire Mr. Bean to wander around the stage for a minute or two, with his two big eyes wide open. Just an idea worth to consider.",1379203200,3,2230,4.397094430992736
8541572,5,B009H3LONI,I could watch this over and over.  This is one hell of a band.  They haven't lost it after 50 years of playing a small number of songs.,1378512000,,135,3.7857142857142856
8541573,5,B009H3LONI,"A terrific document on a timeless band.  Great interviews with Dreja and McCarty, along with the rest of this great band.",1376179200,,121,4.761904761904762
8541574,3,B009H3LONI,"I've followed the Yardbirds music since ""For Your Love"" in the mid-60's, and since 2003, have seen the reformed group a number of times in the US as well as in England.  While the reformed Yardbirds have gone through some personnel changes, they still do a credible job on old favorites as well as newer material.

The DVD production, however, is poor. Between each of the first 12 songs on the DVD the TV screen goes black, like the dead space between songs on an album. Then, on the last 3 songs, someone discovered that modern video editing software can in fact do transitions between frames. Even though recorded in several locations, the song videos could have been stitched together to make a more flowing, immersive DVD that better represents a Yardbirds concert.  While most of the camera shots are fine, some are very grainy, usually on Ben King. I wonder if my cell phone could have done better. This distracts from the quality of the production, too.

The second DVD has an assortment of interviews, a few more songs, and the Glimpses tour documentary is pretty well done.",1372291200,3,1083,4.714285714285714
8541575,3,B009H3LONI,"Well, High expectations but low results...I'm into the originals as I was in high School when the Yardbirds first record hit the charts. These are all excellent musicians, just no EC, JB or JP in this mix. He is a decent player but far from the hype of the disc! For me, It's just OK at it's very best. I watched it once and I can't imagine watching it a second time ever....",1367193600,,375,4.1506849315068495
