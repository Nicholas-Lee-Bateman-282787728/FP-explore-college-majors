8351293,4,B0025X4PE2,"This is a sound remake of D.W Griffith's 1919 classic film.  While this version isn't nearly as good as the original it is still worth watching if you are a fan of the original.  This DVD has muffled sound, but I could still follow the story because I already seen the original film.",1284508800,,283,4.320754716981132
8351294,3,B0025X4PE2,". . . but the dvd case fails to name him. He also wrote the script, after D. W. Griffith's classic Broken Blossoms (1919), in turn based on a short story, The Chink and the Child (1915). This 1936 British film is a first class production, but of course the story looks simplistic to us now. Congrats to Alpha Home Entertainment for turning up this rarity for dedicated movie lovers.",1254182400,,382,4.4714285714285715
