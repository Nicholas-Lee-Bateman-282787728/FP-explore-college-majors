8160598,5,6305048576,The 1997 season was a big suprise.. Did not expect much from such a young team with new coach Jim Fassels. The Giants went 10-5-1 to win the NFC east division title. Not a lot of big names on this team but the video hits on alot of key points that this is a team with a bright future. This is also Tiki Barbers rookie year and the video shows footage of tiki being great even in his rookie year.. Big time Giants fan this is a must own video.,1146009600,,442,3.922222222222222
