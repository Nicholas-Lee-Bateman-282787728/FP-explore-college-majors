459509,5,6302359694,"The employees of Grace Brothers have made ARE YOU BEING SERVED one of England's most popular exports, and their exploits have been a staple of Public Broadcasting Systems for well over a decade.  The characters are classic ...types: the eternal battle ax, the sexy-but-common shopgirl, the pompous ex-military man; the flighty gentleman of uncertain preferences.  And together they run riot with management, customers, and each other in some of the most hilarious situations imaginable.
This particular tape offers three of their best episodes: ""Dear Sexy Knickers,"" ""Our Figures Are Slipping,"" and ""Camping In.""  Although all three are excellent, the first is easily among the best of the entire series, with the department ladykiller Mr. Lucas (Trevor Bannister) writing a note to shopgirl Miss Brahms (Wendy Richard) that goes astray--and causes tremendous confusion in the process.  ""Our Figures Are Slipping"" finds sales down and supervisor Mr. Rumbold (Nicholas Smith) keeping the staff after hours in an effort to devise new sales schemes, and ""Camping In"" finds the entire staff stranded overnight at the store due to a transportation strike.
The situations are farcical, the humor is riske, and the cast is memorable.  If you've heard a lot about ARE YOU BEING SERVED but never seen it, this particular tape is the ideal introduction.  But word of warning: once you've seen it, you want the whole set!",1022025600,2,1410,5.2444444444444445
459510,5,6302359694,"I first ran across ""Are You Being Served?"" a few years ago. It was being aired nightly on the local PBS station and I was fortunate enough to stumble into it. I was captivated immediately and have been a fan ever since. Regretably, it no longer plays on any local stations. Happily, a number of classic episodes are now available on videotape.
Like any good sitcom, the characters in this one become like old friends after a while. If you go for a time without seeing them, you begin to miss them. Also, like all good fictional characters, the inmates of Grace Bros. all have their quirks and foibles, but that's part of their charm and they all become more likeable as they become more familiar. With these videos, the self-important Captain Peacock, irasible Mrs. Slocomb and all the others are there whenever you want to renew the acquintance. You don't have to depend on the whims of a TV station to spend time at Grace Bros. It's available whenever the mood hits. And, if you're anything like me, it hits fairly often.
This is classic British humor. A bit racy, but not as baudy as Benny Hill, and full of double entendre. Because the British idiom is a bit different than the U.S., american viewers may miss a few things. Hang in there, though. You'll pick up on most of it and even learn a few new expressions as you go.
Like most sitcoms, you find yourself liking some episodes better than others. The three on this tape are all very funny, so it's a good place to start. If you like British humor, or if you're just looking a funny video, try ""Are You Being Served?"" volume one. Do so at your own risk, though. You might just get hooked like I am.",1009756800,6,1656,4.432786885245902

Mollie Sugden, playing the stern Mrs. Betty Slocum, Frank Thornton as the militant floor manager Captain Stephen Peacock, Trevor Bannister as Mr. Lucas, Wendy Richard as the ditzy bombshell Miss Shirley Brahms and John Inman as the over-the-top gay man, Mr. Wilberforce ""I'm Free"" Humphries.

459947,5,6302359694,This is one of the few British comedies that I truly love.  The humor is absolutely hilarious.  The way some of the lines are said can be taken the wrong way.  But it was meant to be like that.  I recommend anyone to watch this.,1206144000,2,228,4.0

459949,4,6302359694,"If the answer to the question most asked in this series is yes, then watching this hilarious British sit-com about the ""misadventures"" of a group of salesmen in Grace's Brothers department store is as good a choice as any. This DVD includes the series' pilot, in black and white, and the first five episodes of the series, all in color. During the first two or three episodes most of the jokes are based on double-entendres and in a few cases the authors seem to go as far as overkill. Nevertheless, in the last couple of episodes in this set, the approach changes, and while maintaining the characteristic mentioned, other humorous concepts surface.
The main attraction of this sit-com is its characters, they conform a colorful array of personalities and each has his/her own very distinctive appearance. Mr. Lucas is the junior salesman in the men's department, who has a hard time closing sales, is always on the verge of being fired and has a libido that never ceases to pop up. Mr. Humphries is always picking on Mr. Lucas and always knows the best way to ""fix"" things for their customers. He knows all the tricks in the business and is clearly attracted by his same gender. Mr. Grainger is the head of the men's department; he is a prude who is shocked frequently by the acts of his two underlings. In the women's department, which shares the same floor with the men's, there are two employees, Mrs. Slocombe who is the one in charge and her subordinate Miss. Brahms. Mrs. Slocombe is the typical middle-aged divorced lady, extremely willing to get involved with any worthy candidate for her affection. She brings in variety through her hair color, which is different in each episode. Miss. Brahms is the ""sexy chick"", who is always preyed upon by the male personnel, excluding Mr. Humphries, and who tries to get advantage of every possible benefit she can obtain through her looks. Finally, Captain Peacock is the floor manager, a middle-aged man, extremely strict with the employees, but who also likes to flirt with any available woman, doing no distinctions between employees and customers.
Although as I mentioned before some of the jokes are repetitive you can have a really good time watching this series. An example of the repetitiveness is the line ""Are you free <name>?"" which is used over and over and over and...It will give you the incentive though to continue watching and see if at any point the answer will be ""No, sorry"". I am not going to spoil it for you, so if you want the answer, you will have to get the DVD!",1076976000,18,2539,4.707865168539326
459950,5,6302359694,"This volume is not as solid as volume 2 of the AYBS? set, but it still represents some of the best AYBS? episodes.  It starts with the b&w pilot episode that has the ladies department moving onto the floor that has belonged exclusively to the gents ready-made department for the last 25 years.  Such intrusion creates much tension between the two sides in the first few episodes but, as the staff get used to each other, the problem is not brought up as much and, after Mr. Grainger leaves, is no longer a problem.  Mr. Lucas plays a bigger role in these early episodes (Trevor Bannister having second billing to Mollie Sugden) with Mr. Humphries playing more comedy relief.  John Inman will, of course, become the main star of the show later on.
After the ladies move in, Mr. Lucas has his eye on Miss Brahms in  ""Dear Sexy Knickers.""  This is the famous episode where the ""kneeing"" trousers trick is introduced.  When trousers and ladies underwear are down, the staff must discuss sale ideas after hours in ""Our Figures Are Slipping.""  In ""Camping In,"" the staff is stranded due to a transport strike and must spend the night in tents in the department.  The best part of this episode is when Mrs. Slocombe tells Capt. Peacock that her inflatable mattress takes ""puff after puff after puff"" and Mr. Humphries peaks out from his tent to ask, ""Can I help anybody?""  Classic!.  The gents and ladies finally ban together to take on an outside perfume saleswomen who is intruding on their sales in ""His and Hers.""  Finally, in ""Diamonds...,"" a customer offers a big reward for the recovery of a diamond she lost in the store and it appears every staff member finds it.  The menu pages are very creative with rotating photos of Mrs. Slocombe.  A lift conductor's voice even takes you to each episode!  Of course, every fan will eventually want the entire 2 sets of this hilarious series, so go buy them now!",1073001600,34,1903,4.622023809523809
459951,5,6302359694,"As a Britt I have seen the episodes on sky T.V. and although they were funny didn't know that the pilot was actually a never before seen episode thinking it was the one where the ladies and gents have to share counter space (which is why I wrote this review). Although in black and white and without the bells and whistles it was one of the best I have seen, as you get to see the young Mr. Lucas learning the ropes from Mr. Humphreys. The cast are much friendlier than on latter episodes but the freshness of when Mr. Lucas First sees `Young Mr. Grace' is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.
 It is terrible that we can't get the DVD on region 2 but most players over here can be made to play region 1 disks. Although inquiring into when a set may be releases by the BBC led me round and round the same email addresses, I suppose it makes the series more valuable having to wait a few weeks for them to come.
 All in all I think this is a great purchase and I am definitely going to buy the whole collection one by one. Sorry there is no detailed episode guide but I'm too busy watching the disk :o)",1069200000,7,1109,4.08256880733945

I love this show and this DVD has some of the best.  You also will find that some of the jokes you missed from laughing so hard the first time, you catch the second, third, or more times you see it.

459953,5,6302359694,"The passing years have not taken the shine from this great British sitcom.  Set in a department store in the 1970's (the fashions add to the fun), it features the combined staff of the ladies and gentlemens clothing departments.  Many of the comedy situations come from the interactions of these varied and often eccentric characters.  The usual situation involves various ploys by the management to try to increase the profitibility of the department and the hilarious results which occur when the staff attempt to put these ideas into practice.  While occasionally mildly risque (by '70s standards anyway) it could be enjoyed by almost anyone without too much offence.",1027382400,17,670,5.175925925925926
459954,4,6302359694,"If you're not familiar with British humor, this is a great introduction.  The English are masters at poking innocent fun at themselves.  You'll find this in Shakespeare, in Gilbert & Sullivan, in George Bernard Shaw.  Now, I'm not saying that ""Are You Being Served?"" is comparable to any of the above, but it is way above what we consider typical sitcom comedy.
There are lots of double entendres here, a certain amount of bawdiness.  Again, the bawdiness of English humor goes back at least to Shakespeare and possibly further back for all I know.  However, the show hardly depends on this element.  The humor comes primarily from the mingling of familiar types together into a work situation, and you see here, as in real life, one's co-workers are definitely family of their own.
The first episode, ""Dear Sexy Knickers"", is easily the best of the three, relying on the basic comic situation of a letter intended for one person mistakenly ending up in the hands of another.  However, each episode has its high point, and again, provides a very nice introduction to English comedy.",1023667200,4,1082,4.8478260869565215
