I was hoping this would have been a much better quality video since it was taken from a TV appearance, but it must not have been transferred from the original source because it looks like it was transferred from a VHS tape that had been recorded over about a thousand times. It's a shame, because what you see beyond the shoddy video is a great performance by the stranglers in their prime. The 5 songs on the DVD are
  5 minutes
  shah shah a go go
  ice
  down in the sewer
  hanging around
It appears to originally have been a well-filmed, good quality document. Unfortunately,  that's not what you get on this DVD.",1368230400,11,680,4.403225806451613
