It's pretty amazing. He's a ton of fun. Combine him with a full on crazy Wings Hauser and there's not really a single boring moment to the movie.

Wings is Wings crazy here, which he never needed to patent it cause no one else could do it. He's being turned into a psycho due to some low key David Cronenberg body implants. Even better, everyone seems to have taken Wings' and G Gordon's lead and gone full nutty too. One of the actor's who plays a character named Joker is one of those I can't believe you did that actors. The set must've been a nightmare with the one upping going on with who could be weirder or crazier. I'm sure Wings drew the line at sticking his hands in fellow actors pants and Joker realized I can win this. Yep...it happens.

The biggest knock on the movie is that it doesn't have a budget and when the city is supposed to be burning you don't really get a sense of it cause you're just hearing about it through Robo Cop style TV reports. The second biggest knock is that it's a mash up of Videodrome and Robo Cop but with a sleazier vibe, which shouldn't be possible but it was accomplished. I don't know if it's really a knock though. Most people watching these kinds of movies would flip for something like that.

The biggest take away is G Gordon Liddy and Wings Hauser are a bunch of man.",1463529600,,1554,4.315068493150685

That said, however, you will enjoy this movie, especially the performances and the visuals, if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action VHS. It was produced at approximately $700K and over a 20-day shoot. Its themes are relevant in light of the current presidential campaign.",1453161600,5,326,4.7368421052631575
