6404137,3,B00K7BH5E6,"These are two average to poor films from respected directors. Worth the price of admission possibly because you are curious to see two misfires in the genre from respected casts and crews. Frankenstein mangles the source material and seems to have some really weird nonsense added into it so Branagh can show off his shirtless physique and questionable acting skills. He is generally a good director but this one is out of his league. I was embarrassed at how poor the film has aged in many parts. Some of it is nice and visceral but it simply doesn't do a great job at recreating Shelley's novel. A strange script only exacerbates the problem. The bluray is of decent quality.

Dracula has long divided fans. I remain firmly in the camp that things this thing is mostly mediocre. The acting is fairly poor and the throwbacks to old films, while fun as a novelty, are just distracting at times. The whole thing comes off as some amateurish take on the story; a canvas with paint being thrown on it in every direction because no one has any clue what they are truly doing. Is it supposed to be some send-up of older films? A modern love story? What the hell went wrong with the flow of the story during scripting? It's all over the place and never settles into any one particular mood, and nor does it have a menacing vibe.

The acting is unbearable at times and the special effects laughable despite some very clever tricks here and there. The direction is solid but among the lesser works of Coppola. This thing just needs a new script and modern production design because this one was caught in a net of indecision. Coppola doesn't do horror well and it shows. The bluray itself is mediocre and very soft.

If you want to see these the price is cheap and they are not horrible films per se, just entirely disappointing in the overall scheme of things that could have been. Worth a visit but they are surely not getting my recommendation.",1432684800,,1939,4.5501432664756445

6404141,2,B00K7BH5E6,"Dracula
too long & too slow

Keanu Reeves was probably the weakest link.  His British accent has been described as too posh.  His acting is wooden & unconvincing.

Winon Rider is fine though her British accent is also overdone (though more convincing than Keanu's).

The costumes and makeup are amazing

Frankenstein

Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier.",1503360000,,922,4.716981132075472

6404143,4,B00K7BH5E6,"A previously purchased DVD edition of Bram Stoker's Dracula was a bit muddy and lacked contrast.

This Blu-Ray transfer is much better rendition of the dark world of Dracula.

Coppola's audio commentary explains that the movie was shot entirely in studio with in-camera effects as a tribute to original versions of Dracula.",1481328000,2,323,5.1923076923076925

Good quality picture, better than the original version and the sound is quite good.  I saw this movie when it was first out and with the advances in the technical delivery of new movies it is dated, but still interesting as it is a close representation of the original Bram Stoker tale and Mary Shelley's version of the horror tale.

6404149,4,B00K7BH5E6,"While both films arguably are the closest cinematic adaptations of Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Dracula holds up better and seems to be the more cinematic of the two as well as the more entertaining. Frankenstein is still a good watch, but certain aspects don't feel frightening and DeNiro seems miscast. That noted, this double feature BD set is worth getting for about ten bucks are so. It is two separate BD discs packaged together. Though it does not state it on the packaging, Bram Stoker's Dracula does have extra value feature, including the teaser and theatrical trailer. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein does not have any side from trailers for older films available on home video from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Picture quality is better than average, but not extraordinary, but for the price, if you like both films, this is a good deal.",1470009600,6,913,5.093333333333334

8656523,5,B00K7BH5E6,"This is a great deal on the two movies that are ""closest"" movie adaptations to the original novels. Dracula is closer to the book in my opinion than the Frankenstein version but both are well done.  Perhaps you can thank the influence of Francis Coppola as director of Dracula and Producer of Frankenstein for that. One wonders how Frankenstein would be if it to was directed by Coppola.
Until I read the books later in my life I had no idea how far the Universal 30's movies I watched and loved(and still do) as a kid were from the source material of the books.
So if your a fan of Dracula and Frankenstein then these deserve to be on your video library along with the Universal classics! And this combo pricing..why not?? P.S Read the books too for a full vision!",1516320000,,765,4.425531914893617
