2884018,1,B000SAGGMS,"If you are a fan you will find this film interesting, with a few good sight-gags.

While ""The Fairy"" was brilliantly funny, this film is Not.

Again, if you are already a fan, watch it.

If you are Not already a fan, SKIP THIS FILM!! It's not funny. (Go watch ""The Fairy;"" it's funny :)",1388361600,3,286,4.163636363636364
2884019,5,B000SAGGMS,"See this one right away. It's so much more than a Jacques Tati pastiche - though it is that to a great degree in the first half, especially. A bit uneven in styles, though that may be a virtue, for sure. Anyway, it's genius and so damn entertaining and supremely well-done.",1387929600,2,273,4.372549019607843
2884020,4,B000SAGGMS,"We have also seen ""the Fairy"", with these French stars.  That was as cute and light-hearted and different as L'Iceberg.
Something quite different, when you don't want more of the same.  You'll enjoy it just for what it is...a lovely tale.",1386720000,,238,4.780487804878049
2884021,5,B000SAGGMS,"This little gem draws you in unawares and makes you feel so much yearning for life and love and dreams. There is almost no dialogue but we are shown the rich essence of each characters via the most telling and endearing physical comedy reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and we cannot help but fall in love with them, with all their imperfect, utterly fragile and beautiful humanity.",1382572800,,379,4.757575757575758
2884022,5,B000SAGGMS,"A creative French movie. I enjoyed it. Fiona Gordon's movie are a must see. Not much dialogue, but still full of entertainment.",1377216000,2,127,4.818181818181818
2884023,5,B000SAGGMS,"...in a sea of Belgian humour. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The dialog is sparse, the acting superb and the plot quirky. Those who don't get kinetic humour (not slapstick - think more of the actors' backgrounds in circus clowning) will be left out in the cold. I found the back cover to be a mild spoiler. My following description is more sparse but you might enjoy this gem more if you don't read anything past the following period. No not this one. The one further to the right of the previous one. Well, don't say I didn't warn you. The protagonist accidentally locks herself into a freezer and isn't discovered until the next morning - as a result she develops an obsession with cold which begins her journey to L'Iceberg of her dreams.",1273104000,4,764,4.464285714285714
2884024,4,B000SAGGMS,"The three filmmakers are also all professional clowns, and about 85% of the film is without dialogue.
Shot in a theatrical, low budget way, it recalls a smaller, less ambitious and philosophical Roy Andersson.
It made me laugh out loud a couple of times, and smile a good deal.  However, even at 84 minutes
it did start to drag by the end, and some of the bits started to wear thin.  None-the-less, this
is a lovely, worthwhile experimental nod to Chaplin, Keaton, et al, if not quite on their level of
genius.  But then, who is?",1271635200,3,529,4.489583333333333
2884025,4,B000SAGGMS,"The Belgian comedy, ""L'Iceberg,"" is such a head-scratching little oddity that it is virtually impossible to describe it for anyone who hasn`t already seen it.  It's a highly stylized tale of a young restaurant manager who decides to break away from her stultifying and humdrum existence after she inadvertently locks herself in a freezer overnight - only to discover, once she gets out, that her husband and their two carbon-copy young children have failed to notice her absence.  Realizing her utter insignificance to those around her, Fiona strikes out on her own, abandoning her job and staying away from home for long stretches of time - eventually setting out to sea with a mysterious deaf/mute sailor she meets along the way.

Utilizing concepts straight out of the Theater of the Absurd, ""L'Iceberg"" pokes fun at the sterility of modern life, as Fiona finally breaks free of the bonds of domesticity and goes on a quest for love and adventure.  Directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon (who play the husband and wife in the film) have composed their film almost entirely of straight-on block shots, perfect for emphasizing the surreal spareness of the drama and setting.  The lanky, bug-eyed Gordon, who looks for all the world like a cross between Frances McDormand and a stringy-haired Olive Oyl, plays Fiona with a mouth-breathing, deadpanned seriousness that enhances our empathy for the character and heightens the satirical nature of the piece.

Original in concept and bold in execution, ""L'Iceberg"" is irrepressibly imaginative and visually inventive in its cockeyed portrayal of the world around us.",1213747200,17,1616,5.172413793103448
2884026,5,B000SAGGMS,"This is Belgian film (so the comments about the French and Jerry Lewis are not only tired, but also not applicable) that combines clown/mime-like physical comedy and stylized set design in style reminiscent of Jacques Tati. The pace of the movie may be on the slow side for those accustomed to nothing but Hollywood fare, but this is by no means your stereotypical self-indulgent European art house cinema. The performances are great (especially that of the lead actress who won an audience award in Seattle) and if you like movies that show you something different, you'll love this one. It's almost like a comic version of ""Open Water"" (without the sharks) in the way it explores relationships.",1193616000,19,696,4.957264957264957
2884027,1,B000SAGGMS,"I didn't spend any money on this. I watched a copy I obtained from the Library. Even though it was free & only 84 minutes long, I still feel cheated. This movie is terrible. Every scene is dragged out. I guess the reason Jerry Lewis is such a hit in France is reflected in the ""humor"" of this offering. Do not spend any money on this. If you must,waste your time only.",1193443200,2,368,4.125

2884042,4,B000SAGGMS,"A quirky movie indeed.  Fiona, a fast-food manager gets locked in the walk-in freezer overnight, her family apparently didn't notice.  I think she becomes obsessed with cold and leaves her family in search of an iceberg.  Sound a little quirky?  Very little dialogue, the film relies greatly on sight gags and physical comedy.  The lead actress must have had bruises after filming.  There is some very brief, non-sexual nudity.  I found the film humorous and enjoyable to watch.",1436054400,,478,5.051282051282051
2884043,4,B000SAGGMS,"Quirky, fun & entertaining movie.  I enjoy watching movies from other countries, as they are imaginative and don't need all the Hollywood money to make a terrific and entertaining movie without the overglamorous actors and actresses.  The people in this movie looked like everyday people you may meet on the street, although they do have quite extrodinary dancing abilities which are very different from the norm.  I really enjoyed this movie.",1428710400,,443,5.211267605633803
2884044,5,B000SAGGMS,"Not for everyone, you need some time to understand the plot and laugh about it, however, overall, this is a different kind of movie that was very entertaining.",1428624000,,159,4.714285714285714
2884045,1,B000SAGGMS,"I wanted to like this film and kept watching, hoping some thing would change, but all I saw was a production that was dull in color, had flat characters, and was not entertaining. The funny parts weren't even funny",1423872000,,214,4.512820512820513
2884046,5,B000SAGGMS,"Loved it, Fiona especially is hysterical.  In particular, the initial scenes in the icebox, and her on the boat doing various things.loved watching her.  Her husband getting dressed sleepily in the am, hysterical.  The Eskimo lady was funny too.  Loved the quality of the film.  This is the one that made me watch the others.",1420329600,,325,4.836363636363636
2884047,2,B000SAGGMS,Stupid made no sense maybe I don't get french humor or it was a low budget comedy,1420243200,,81,3.823529411764706
2884048,2,B000SAGGMS,"there were some hilarious moments in it but on the whole it was a strange and strangely told. story about a woman who is breaking out of the doldrums of her every-day life by becoming obsessed with ice and icebergs.  the woman is quite emotionless, the left behind husband is not.  it seems amateurish but is probably intended that way.  more like a fable, an allegory.  i couldn't relate to it.",1418428800,,395,4.52112676056338
2884049,2,B000SAGGMS,"I so wanted to love or even like this movie but it fell flat. I agree with the other reviewers who recommended the actor/director's other film ""The Fairy"", which I loved. This film was sloooow and it has it's moments but overall it's rather bland in comparison. It just never got off the ground for me and I stopped watching it, but I wanted to give it a chance so I decided to finish watching it and I wish I would have turned in early instead. It's a lovingly done movie and that comes across so it may appeal to some. I probably would have enjoyed it much more if I didn't have such high expectations from seeing ""The Fairy"" - which is an absolute jewel of a movie. These actors are amazing and  authentic so I'll delve into more of their work.",1417132800,,747,4.223776223776224

2884053,5,B000SAGGMS,"This was the second in my discovery of Fiona Gordon and Dom Abel. The Fairy blew me away and this one really touched me on a personal level. There is a depth to this movie while still celebrating the art of slapstick comedy.  Honestly, so many years have passed since I experienced great slapstick that I had forgotten what it was!  These two are sheer genius!  I loved everything about this movie, the story music, choreography, settings, all the elements that go into great film making.",1406246400,,488,4.651162790697675
2884054,5,B000SAGGMS,"Basically it was the most ridiculous story.  I couldn't help watching it because I figured there must be more to it.  Yes, it was the story of how she found her husband.",1393372800,,169,4.25
2884055,1,B000SAGGMS,"The theme of the unappreciated, overworked wife/mother  is an old one and this film does nothing to redeem the subject.  If the writers were trying to render slap stick they missed their mark, as did the actors in their shot at pantomime.  I'll give this over long skit one star for the ability of the producers to find actors willing to be in it, and especially for their actually having it filmed and distributed.  I give myself a minus 10 stars for watching it almost to the end.",1392940800,3,482,4.443181818181818
2884056,4,B000SAGGMS,"I found this movie by accident in my surfing through Prime.  While not quite as funny as ""L'Fairy"", I find I am enjoying Dom and Fiona
very much!  When Fiona got locked in the freezer, her family didn't realize she didn't come home and just went on with their lives,
I can understand why Fiona had a breakdown, of sorts!  They took her for granted, so she set out on a quest  with the sailor to find her iceberg.  I love that Fiona is a physical comedienne, and the movie needs few words to get the point across.",1391731200,,512,4.183673469387755
2884057,1,B000SAGGMS,"It had some good circus performances in it, but it never really took off as a movie.  I did not watch the entire disc because I was hoping to watch a movie and didn't find this interesting to me.",1391558400,2,195,4.0

8204965,5,B000SAGGMS,"I'd say this is the best film I've ever seen.

Its made in a style I was unaware of (although, not being a film buff, maybe it's the way old Charlie Chaplin films were made - or maybe these guys invented it?!) Almost every scene has nothing but the establishing shot. No medium shots, no closeups. On occasion the main action is outside through a window, and yet, somehow, this doesn't just make it funnier at times  - the performances and story-telling are done with a brilliant cleverness - somehow you're drawn in even more, as you are not being spoon fed, but are, to an extent, forced to engage your own mind and imagination.

The actors are so brilliant, and so committed to their deadpan characters, that a yawn -  a sustained yawn - can lead to guffaws of laughter.

Im writing this review because I saw some one star reviews. These are written by stupid people, with no souls, and no sense of beauty or wonder. One might argue it would make the world a better place if they died, but of course they're not really alive anyway. So you can safely ignore their one star reviews (written from their zero star lives.)

The film is a fable, and thus is universal (again, to anyone with a soul), speaking to the insatiable drive of a Hillary to climb Mount Everest, or of a man determined to build a replica of the Eiffel Tower with toothpicks  or something equally illogical  or, indeed, of anyone with a passion accompanied by an inkling of the synchronistic connections that can make decisions driven by illogical yet overpowering passions the most perfect ones.

I am grateful that these people put their time, talents, and energies into this great work of great beauty.

8204966,5,B000SAGGMS,"It's what's on the screen that counts.

L'iceberg is pure movie making. Movies should be made by showing the action, not talking about the action. And what both Fiona Gordon and Dominique do is tell their story by showing. The two add a Capital S to the words Show

When Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton were the king of comedies during the silent era, moviegoers didn't care if they heard words or not. All they care about was the action on the screen: the visual presentation told the story, not the words. L'iceberg is made in the same style as silent movies in the 1920s. As a result, this movie is brilliant to watch. And I sit and watch a movie. I don't sit and listen to a movie. So to say, the least, this movie is worth watching. It's hysterical. And well acted, not only by Gordon and Abel, but also Bruno Remy.",1465257600,,822,4.3311688311688314
8204967,5,B000SAGGMS,"The usual quirky, silly, stretch-the-boundaries fare you expect from Dom and Fiona. Not as funny as Rhumba, but awfully funny none-the-less.",1458086400,,140,5.714285714285714
8204968,4,B000SAGGMS,"""L'Iceberg"" (2006 release from Belgium; 84 min.) brings the story of a dysfunctional family. As the movie opens, an Inuktitut woman addresses us about her life (only much later do we understand why), and after that brief prologue of sorts, we get to know Fiona, a woman in her thirties. While she is closing up the fast food joint she manages, she accidentally locks herself in the walk-in freezer and spends the night. Meanwhile we see that her husband Julien, utterly aloof, doesn't even notice Fiona isn't there. When Fiona returns home the next day, she realizes that Julien and the kids didn't know she missed the night. What will Fiona do next? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is one remarkable movie from Belgium (where I grew up). First of all, there is hardly any dialogue in the movie. A sentence here, a word there, and that's about it. It's all about the visuals and the physical comedy. About 15 minutes into the movie, I thought to myself, ""this is so Jacques Tati!"". Take for example the classic bedroom scene, where Julien accidentally kicks Fiona off the bed, and then goes into a battle with the bed sheets. Wonderful scene.  Also do not think that just because there is so few spoken scenes that there isn't a story line. Au contraire, the story line moves forward with significant strides throughout the movie. Interestingly, the movie is co-written and co-directed by the actors playing Fiona and Julien. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found the movie to be highly original, quirky and engaging from start to finish.

I recently saw ""L'Iceberg"" at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati, which it was shown as part of a French Comedy Movies series brought in partnership with the local Alliance Francaise (even though this movie is not French, but who's keeping track). The one-off showing was quite well attended. I had no idea what to expect going in, but walked out of the theater with a smile on my face. If you are in the mood for a comedy that is off-center and then some, you can't go wrong with this. ""L'Iceberg"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1455148800,,2192,4.658914728682171

8204970,5,B000SAGGMS,"Spoiler alert:  Since I saw _The Fairy_, I love everything Abel, Gordon and Romy have done.  I discover something new on every viewing.

I bought this movie on DVD because who knows how long it will stay on Prime.  Philippe Martz as the perennial foil in these films (he's brilliant in _The Fairy_) is a joy here, as are the senior citizens who help Fiona.  These films may confuse some people because there are no bad guys.  The filmmakers hold a gently optimistic world view that for a moment makes you forget your troubles.

I can't wait to see what this trio produces next!",1449446400,,577,4.490384615384615
