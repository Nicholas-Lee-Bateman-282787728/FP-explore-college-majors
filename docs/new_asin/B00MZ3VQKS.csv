6605001,5,B00MZ3VQKS,"My ""Real McCoys"" season 6 discs all play just fine! I did find that some of the discs would not load up on my portable DVD player.  They were fine however on my upconverter & BluRay. That can be typical of DVD-R, so don't give up if one player won't play it. Again, they are DVD-R's. They have the reddish tint colour on the burned side.
 Quality is good on both audio & video, with exception of disc 2 episode ""The Crop Duster"" where voices do not sync perfectly with lips of person talking. Otherwise, this is not an issue.
 After many years of waiting, thank you SFM for finally giving us the complete set of one of the greatest classic shows ever to air. A great addition to my DVD library.",1414108800,,694,4.242424242424242
6605002,1,B00MZ3VQKS,"It's sad about season 6 of this fine sitcom.
 All of you  lovers of the REAL MCCOYS like I am are gonna be in for a BIG LET DOWN !!! first of all there's no more KATE, they had her passed away, and no LITTLE LUKE or HASSIE  and last half of the season NO GRANDPA !!!  so you see what I mean ? THEY SHOULD OF NEVER OF HAD SEASON 6 , WHAT A WASTE !!!!",1413763200,13,349,3.4935064935064934

6605004,3,B00MZ3VQKS,This is good to have with the other seasons but it is not good because they changed from ABC to CBS and changed the whole theme at the beginning and Kate is dead in this season. Don't like the episodes as much but love that grandpa is in them.,1413676800,6,243,3.979591836734694
6605005,4,B00MZ3VQKS,"Its the Mccoys.  Of course I like it,  I have all seasons now except 5 which I am still trying to get a copy of that will play.  However,  there is one big difference in season 6 compared to seasons 1-4  and that is the sound.  In the others the sound is fine.  In season 6 however, the season is very brassy  and harsh sounding.  I don't know what happened to this seasons recording but it is not the same quality sound at all as previous seasons.",1413158400,3,448,4.057471264367816

6605012,4,B00MZ3VQKS,"True, this season isn't anything like the previous five, but its still entertaining. I would have given it an additional star, but the sound quality is much worse than the earlier seasons--particularly in the opening music.",1415404800,2,223,5.222222222222222
6605013,3,B00MZ3VQKS,"although i love the first 5 seasons of the real mccoys and HIGHLY recommend them, after watching season 6 is a bit of a let down of sorts.........kate is dead (what happened is not revealed) , hassey and lil' luke aren't there either,,,,,,,,,grandpa mccoy (WALTER BRENNAN who is brilliant in the first 5 seasons) is barely there (mostly out of town at some relatives visiting)and when he is it seems like he's reading his lines off of cue cards off to the side like he couldn't be bothered with rehearsals for season 6 . pepino and george macmichael  and his sister flora are on sometimes.................new neighbors move in and of course its a good looking woman and her son (BUTCH PATRICK  before he was eddie munster) and no husband and father so luke starts dating her ..........it's alright entertainment but if your looking for the real mccoys..........it's barely mccoys......... in one episode luke and pepino go to LA and pass a building with an auction going on and luke tells pepino lets go in maybe he can buy a gift for kates birthday????????????HUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! kates supposed to be dead.............some episodes just end in the middle of the show ,then the next show is missing but the dvd counter is counting and then the next show ( with joan blondell as aunt win the neighbor ladies aunt) just starts in the middle of the show...............if you don't buy season 6 your really not missing much........i paid almost $40.00 for it and feel cheated..........",1414972800,15,1479,4.888446215139442

6605015,1,B00MZ3VQKS,"I am very disappointed that Kate and the kids are no longer on Season 6.  It is NOT the same!  I would have never bought this season...especially for this price...had I known in advance.  In the show, they refer to Luke as being a widow as though they were talking about the president resigning at the last Grange meeting!!  The least they could have done was have Luke and Grandpa look as though they missed her...not just her cleaning skills and apple pie!  Kate and the kids must have asked for more money and the producers canned them that season.  Had I only known.  I'm taking out my Season 6 from the DVD player and replacing it with Season 1 of Hazel. (Of course, I won't be watching the last season of Hazel either since everybody but Hazel moved to Brazil or some such in that season.  At least the producers didn't just kill them off in a plane crash or something!)",1414368000,12,876,4.364197530864198

8675467,2,B00MZ3VQKS,VERY PIXILATED I HAVE ALL THE OTHER SEASONS AND THEY WERE ALL FINE THIS COPY IS VERY DIRTY LOOKING ALSO .I PROBABLY WILL SEND IT BACK I DONT SEE OTHER COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM MAYBE ITS JUST THE ONE I GOT I took a screen shot of the opening to show just how bad it looks this is playing on a Sony Bravia tv this is what it really looks like . I would like to see if others looks like this .,1531699200,,393,3.746987951807229
8675468,1,B00MZ3VQKS,"Not sure if the shows new network (CBS) or who was responsible for how this season turned out, but it is terrible.  Its like they kept throwing different ides at the wall to see what would stick.  From the slower, dragging bell ringing and opening theme that sounds like it was sung in a can to the last episode, it is a letdown.  Kate has been killed off with no information on what happened.  Hassle and Little Luke are gone and never mentioned.  Grandpa Amos, the highlight of the series shows up more in the opening credits (picture from the first 5 seasons) than he does in actual episodes!  New characters keep being added with little development.  A new love interest with a son played by Butch Patrick from The Munsters.  An aunt played by Joan Blondell is added.  And Worst of all, an Uncle Rightly (seen in the attached image with Luke) who they try to make a new Amos, but the character doesnt even come close.  The ONLY reason to buy this season is to complete a collection.  Its no wonder it was cancelled after this season.",1525910400,,1037,4.4338624338624335
8675469,5,B00MZ3VQKS,"Hey enjoying my Real McCoys, Father Knows Best, & Petticoat Junction.  I grew up on these series and they have remastered them perfectly.  If you buy them, you will enjoy them!!!!!",1523577600,,180,4.774193548387097
8675470,1,B00MZ3VQKS,"It's been a real joy collecting each season and watching the ""Reall McCoys"".

I just finished watching the 5th season of The Real McCoys and it was really good. It was great to see a Christmas episode.

Then I put the first disc in of season 6 and I was devastated.

I couldn't believe that they would even bother making a 6th season with certain characters missing.

I don't even know if I can watch anymore of the season 6, because they killed off Kate. In the first few shows you find out that Kate died 18 months ago. They also removed both Hassi and little Luke as well.

Kate was my favorite character of the entire show as most women or a mother like character are the cornerstone of a family's morals. But every character was great on this show of the seasons before season 6.

Here on season 6, big Luke doesnt even seem to have any remorse or sorrow that Kate is gone. Almost as if he was never married. A bachelor ready to be a delightful playboy as they continue getting themselves into trouble with one housekeeper after another.

Hassi shows up for a few minutes in the first episode, but then never shows up again. They never show little Luke ever again.

They created a new Real McCoy song with the same jingle with only grandpa, Luke, Papino and George McMichaels in the song.

After doing some research, the reason Kate Nolan left the Real McCoys in 1963 was she had a dispute with the producers and wanted to move on after 5 seasons to pursue other TV shows.

Without the women in the show especially Kate, its like walking out into a desert and putting a bunch of dry sand in your mouth. The spirit and spice is totally gone in season 6.

Also its a lost not having little Luke in the mix with all of his funny moments of still growing up.",1517788800,,1759,4.3
8675471,4,B00MZ3VQKS,It's Ok. Knocked it down a star for the lack of no Kate as well as Walter Brennan only appearing in a few of the episodes. Theme music was totally changed but felt it would add to my total collection of the Real McCoys.,1517529600,,219,4.0

8675475,5,B00MZ3VQKS,I love many of the programs of my childhood. I purchased the entire series at Amazon,1432771200,,84,4.3125
8675476,5,B00MZ3VQKS,"The Real McCoys Season 6 is great ! You can watch it with anybody. My favorite episode is The Farmer And Adele. Mamie Van Doren guest stars  as a crooked dance instructor, who cons Luke into 20 years of dance lessons. Of course Grandpa saves the day. Mamie looks beautiful in 1962, and I saw this originally when it ran. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her for her stand on women's and gay rights. She is a living legend,and one of the last stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Mamie Van Doren fans, and comedy lovers will like this the most.",1429142400,2,571,4.1441441441441444
