5134616,5,B0085ZDX3I,"I was so pleased to find that they had finally  released the third season of this series. It is hillarious from the beginning. I wish it had gone on longer, but I'm glad that I can revisit it any time I want.",1378425600,2,208,3.9523809523809526

5134618,4,B0085ZDX3I,"""Dave's World"" wasn't ""Seinfeld"" or ""Cheers""--it was never appointment TV.  But what it was is a solid, usually funny sitcom with likeable actors.  Worth watching for a few laughs.",1364256000,,180,5.172413793103448
5134619,4,B0085ZDX3I,"I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this show. I do miss the opening credit song by Billy Joel, But the rest is excellent.
I'm glad of the way Amazon is getting these unreleased shows to us, but I do have one suggestion. Make them to where the episodes play one after the other. I don't like that I have to press play on the remote for each episode to play. After each episode the disc returnes to the chapter menu. That, to me, is annoying. And for this reason, it loses a star. But, hey! At least I have the season on DVD. Thank you Amazon.",1349740800,2,541,4.065420560747664
5134620,5,B0085ZDX3I,"I am a big fan of Dave's World.  I watched it when it was on TV and have been constantly trying to get all the seasons on DVD. I managed to find Seasons 1 & 2 a couple of years ago.  Finally, out came Season 3...am still waiting for the rest!  The children in this program are superb actors, as is the whole cast.  They all compliment each other.  Too bad we don't have this type of humor anymore.  The writing is excellent and the delivery perfect.  The introduction of Patrick Warburton, who is now a big star in his own right, was cleverly done.  When I have had a bad day and am really in need of a real belly-laugh, I watch a couple episodes of Dave's World.  It never fails to cheer me up! Harry Anderson is a perfect person to play Dave Barry.  I have read all Barry's books and they are great.  Harry does him justice.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of the final seasons.",1349308800,,885,4.141176470588236
5134621,5,B0085ZDX3I,"Thank you Amazon for offering this product manufactured on demand. It feels like I have waited forever for this to be released. I hope there is enough ""demand"" for this product that the 4th and final season also will be released, and soon! There are so many great lines in each episode, I hate to miss even one more. The quality of these episodes is great. I'm sure there are some more bits that had to be cut because of music rights, but it seems mostly intact based on my natually hazy memory after all of these years. And yes, the opening theme lyrics are missing, but they did manage to slip them in for at least 1 episode! Just hearing them once again is great, and in my mind I can hear the words as the music plays in the episodes without lyrics. If you are a fan of Dave's World but are waiting to buy this set because of the ""manufactured on demand"" aspect, don't. For lovers of the show, it is worth every penny to finally get to see them again!",1345593600,5,955,4.195652173913044
