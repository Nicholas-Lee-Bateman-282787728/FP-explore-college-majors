8135792,4,B000H0MN2Q,I got this for my son because he loves the show. I have watched it with him and seen the whole of the series I believe. It was pretty good and I enjoyed the story. It is engrossing and you can get invested in the characters without fear of them going poof by the end. I think the ending was pretty good to and like how they left it so that it could continue. I like a story that has a happy ending. I would though recommend seeing it from the start to finish and not trying to watch out of order.,1376870400,,496,3.872549019607843
8135793,5,B000H0MN2Q,"Things slow down a bit in this volume. There's a lot of character growth but not a ton of progress. The second quarter of a series is often the slowest part since the introduction is over and the story isn't quite ramping up yet. The episodes are still quite good though and the character interactions and story/character growth. Some of the drama included is actually somewhat of a downer, but then again you can't have proper character growth without the ups and downs.

As far as the production quality goes the series remains as consistent as ever. A lot of series tend to drop the quality over time as they've drawn in their audience and don't need quite the flash, but I'm glad Eureka Seven hasn't gone that route so far.",1209254400,,727,4.549618320610687
8135794,4,B000H0MN2Q,"In Eureka Seven volume 4, you get four great episodes of the show. On the last DVD, the Gekko was damaged in a battle with the military, now repairs are needed. During this time, a new healthfood craze strikes the Gekko. Due to this, Renton must go with Eureka and Matthew to get a health fruit. Of course, during the search, the three meet Renton's uncle and stay at his home, but he soon turns them over to the military. Renton is forced to abandon his childhood as he tries to rescue his freinds by single handedly flying the Nirvash, but this has an unexpected conesquence for Eureka...

In the second episode, the Gekko hides in a mine to make repairs, but Renton goes with a search group to check the mine, He finds a vision of Eureka and Anemone that leaves him less than alright. Next, Ken-Goh takes a team to a maker of reflection film, but finds he has died. Now Ken-Goh must try and give his less than ambitious son a boost of confidence to make the much needed repairs for the Gekko.

Finally, Renton meets an old digger in the mine and they become friends, but Renton will soon learn not to trust everyone as desperate men sometimes do very desperate things. The whole episode leaves Renton feeling down and isolated, and Eureka angry. A fateful event is about to occur....

These episode are all interesting and work very well to show the emotional progress(or lack there of) for Renton and Eureka. I recommend this disc to all fans of anime, though if you are new to Eureka Seven, start with volume 1 so you don't get lost.",1176854400,,1538,4.446808510638298
8135795,5,B000H0MN2Q,"Eureka is feeling depressed lately because the relationship between her and Nirvash has become strained. Renton is now able to pilot it without her help and Eureka takes it personally. She thought that she was the only one it would ever accept. It's left to you whether she's jealous of Renton stealing the Nirvash or of the Nirvash stealing Renton! Because Eureka clams up and won't talk to him, Renton begins to build up a little resentment of his own, which might send Eureka into a downward spiral. But this volume isn't all serious. The first episode on the disk sports a very Cowboy Bebopesque feel to it as Renton, Matthiew, and Eureka go looking for a stinky fruit said to do wonders for your health as the Gekkostate's crew is going through a little healthy diet fad.

This show is just great. It builds up the characters and plot with just enough information to keep you watching but never enough to frustrate you like some anime. Eureka and Renton seem to be growing together and becoming adults a little before their time (if Eureka is even human). The thing that intrigues me the most is what Anemone's real mission is and what exactly are Eureka and her? And what are the LFOs? The animation, voice acting, and writing are all some of the best I have ever experienced. There is still a wealth of background data to be divulged so this show has a lot of room to grow.",1165104000,2,1380,4.52
