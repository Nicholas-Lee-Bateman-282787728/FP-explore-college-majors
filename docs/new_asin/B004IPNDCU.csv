8431093,5,B004IPNDCU,"This DVD is a great look at Bruce Lee's earlier life.  It is from his brother's perspective, which offers a pretty unique perspective on his story.  There are many dvds, books, etc about him, told from the perspective of scholars and those who became involved in his later years. Here, we get the insider's look, since the DVD has intercuts interviews with Lee's sister and brother - adding the sense of history to the film. The actor that plays Bruce Lee is pretty good too.

The DVD is high quality and region-free so should play on all players (Just make sure you check the seller's comments). Also, there are special features and subtitles.  A must have for all Wing Chun or Bruce Lee enthusiasts!",1296432000,,701,4.629032258064516
