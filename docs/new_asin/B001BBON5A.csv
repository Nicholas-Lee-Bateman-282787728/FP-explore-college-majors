8282629,2,B001BBON5A,"This review only concerns the packaging of the DVD.  I have not even had a chance to listen to it.  It comes in a chintzy type of envelope I have never seen before, and the DVD was stuck in it, so that the cover was ripped by the time I got the DVD out.  The DVD itself is on a kind of tray with no covering whatsoever, so that the envelope is necessary to protect it.  However, if I put the tray with the DVD back, I will probably have the same problem getting it out again in spite of the ripped envelope.
I may write another review for the contents once I have heard the DVD.",1285977600,3,578,3.9145299145299144
