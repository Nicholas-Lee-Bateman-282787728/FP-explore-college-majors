Detective sergeant Eve Granger (Gemma Redgrave) is up against a manipulative convicted (and incarcerated) serial killer Brian Wicklow (Matthew Kelly) who is obsessed with her. The leading man, Jake Osbourne (John Hannah) shot & killed his (cheating) wife and tortured/murdered his wife's police-officer lover, for which he spent a decade + incarcerated with Wicklow. Despite this, DS Eve Granger falls in love with him. (Far-fetched, to say the very least.)

The story gets even sillier. Jake Osbourne has profiler-like insight into the enigmatic Brian Wicklow (and other killers, too.) And he is regularly invited to provide special insight to homicide detectives as they work on various murder cases. (Defense attorneys would love that!) For the most part, the homicide detectives are willing to forget that Osbourne is a convicted cop-killer.  Eve Granger never considers what a relationship with someone like Osbourne would do to her career.

The cast is comprised of actors I really admire, however, even actors like John Hannah and Gemma Redgrave can't work miracles with bad scripts.",1504310400,,1152,5.313186813186813

Matthew Kelly gives a chilling performance as the serial killer in this two part thriller from Granada Manchester.  Others are also superb:  Jemma Redgrave as a detective; John Hannah as her ex-boyfriend (and murderer and Kelly's ex-cellmate); Andrew Tiernan as another murderer;  Ace Bhatti and David Calder as detectives.
  The episodes are relatively short - just under.  1:10 hours each; but the plots hold interest throughout.  Don't want to give too much away, so briefly:
Part 1 - 'Inside The Mind Of A Killer' deals with the search for a victim.  Kelly's spent 15 years 'playing  a psychological game of cat-and-mouse' over the location of the body.
Part 2 - In 'The Killer Is Out For Revenge,' the still incarcerated Kelly plots; after all, what I else does he have to do?
  There are a few gory scenes, no sex and no bad language; the evil is mental.  The actors do an excellent job and the camera focuses on details - this is one to really watch to fully appreciate.
  The dvd was made in Canada by Koch Vision; there's no 'play all,' no bonuses,  and no subtitles but the accents aren't difficult to understand.  For the record, there is and should be only one disc.
  This is not the best thriller of recent times but it's much better than most;  it's well worth the time and money.",1429747200,,1367,4.524590163934426

I was very disappointed.
