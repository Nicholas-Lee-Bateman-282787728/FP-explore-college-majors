3886480,5,B002AL2TYM,"Have  always appreciated Jason Gedrick's performances & this proved to be another good role for him. It was enjoyable for the Christmas season & would have been any time. He, following a disappointment in his life, rose to the occasion to help a group of street people improve their lives by giving back just as the hero (Jason) had done to overcome some problems in his life. Everybody lived happily everafter!",1257033600,14,411,4.788732394366197

3886489,4,B002AL2TYM,"Surprisingly suitable for young adults, this true, encouraging, & enjoyable story is lightly told of two worlds meeting each others' needs & becoming overcomers--don't miss the astonishing ending note at the credits!

3886491,4,B002AL2TYM,Great Christmas story.  I don't think Rhea Perlman is really the star of the show.  The Choir director and the men are much more interesting characters. A great story of using your talents and learning about helping others help themselves. Shows people aren't always who you think they are and you aren't always who you think you are.

sweet watching the guys in the choir wrestle with their demons and come
out successful.  Yes, it's a little predictable with the 'love interest', but that just
adds to it's charm in my view.  Of course, I'm a sucker for the Christmas Carol
as well.  They should show this movie more often during the season.",1458000000,,382,4.573529411764706

It just goes to show how much music can do to change lives and bring joy to people all around.

3886585,5,B002AL2TYM,"I loved this movie but I love true stories that inspire us to do something beyond what we think we're capable to do.  It is about  a too busy and over focused executive, and brings him into the lives of homeless men who need a second chance.  They form an unlikely Christmas choir that has to hurdle over several problems to reach their goal.  They all learn something about themselves, including the executive who thought moving up in his career was a worthy goal.  Then he meets this ragtag group of men, and sees that there is more to life than money and power.  Hopefully we're all inspired to see beyond ourselves a little more after watching this true story.",1361577600,2,664,4.491666666666666

3886590,5,B002AL2TYM,"I like that this movie was based on fact.  It portrays an accountant's chance meeting with people in a homeless shelter, and his desire to help them to help themselves.  It does a good job of conveying the difficulty of earning trust, particularly from those who have been disappointed in life.  It also shows the power of perseverance and caring.  Being a spunky nun was a good part for Rhea Perlman, and her character added to the story.  I recommend this movie.",1359072000,,464,4.609756097560975

3886594,5,B002AL2TYM,"If you want a fresh newer film based on a true story with the Christmas Spirit showing, ""It is more blessed to give than receive,"" see The Christmas Choir rather than a Scrooge classic.  It begins with a workaholic accountant's fiancee breaking up with him followed by a man inviting him to his ""home"" that ends up being a homeless shelter.  You'll see the accountant's priorities change focus from himself to others, become flexible, encouraging and forgiving. Characters start to realize they need and learn from one another, making a difference individually and by working together. You'll hear Christmas carols sung by the rag-tag choir change to a unified harmonious group.  Meanwhile, lives and relationships heal and a romance buds. So, during the holidays let this story inspire you and make your heart sing.",1356739200,,816,5.074626865671642

3886598,5,B002AL2TYM,Christmas is not about doing things to please yourself but doing doing things so that others may be pleased with themselves. A wonderful movie about bringing an uplifting moment to those who need to know that someone cares. The results may not be to the magnitude that was reached in the movie but every act creates a joy in someone. See this movie then start your own acting career.,1328659200,2,383,4.565217391304348

3886601,5,B002AL2TYM,"This is a wonderful movie, good for all to watch. Guys shouldn't discount it as a chic flick. This is said to be based on a true story. This very busy accountant is very wrapped up in his work, loses his fiancee and finds himself listening to a guy playing the piano in a bar (I think he was having a pop) and they begin talking and the guy takes him home to visit his family. Come to find out, they go to a homeless shelter. He is basically told to do something good. He begins remembering the times he and his mom had sang and played the piano before she died. He had an estranged relationship with his father. Anyhow, he starts a choir, wanting to help the homeless guys earn some money and help them help themselves. He found himself not needing to work at his accounting job so many extra hours overtime but found what was more important. He started to notice a worker at the subway station and they started talking and she suggested they sing there. Well the police broke that up and cited the man for not having a permit; however, they sang well enough to get a permit. The father comes in the picture. Ups and downs with the people of the choir, the father, the new lady, the leader himself occur. Wonderful blessings arose from the two guys meeting for all.",1323993600,,1266,4.301255230125523

3886603,5,B002AL2TYM,"A well made Hallmark movie that's encouraging and uplifting ""inspired by a true story""(whatever that means & to what extent?) that's actually has three plots revolving about the main character presented in a somewhat episodic manner that come together as the movie progresses.

The first involving the hero, a well suited accountant(handsomely played by Jason Gedrick who also did another Hallmark romance 'Hidden Places'), whose purpose in life needs refining.  He's a workaholic, socially inept and unhappy.  He encounters a bunch of homeless men in a shelter run by a nun, the ever able and entertaining Rhea Perlman.  She's her usual sweet and sarcastic self.  With her OK, he sets out to start a choir from a ""bunch of losers"".

The second theme is about him and his estranged, alcoholic father(superbly done with sublety by Michael Sarrazin), and the third, my favorite, is a very sweet, gradually developing romance with a stranger he meets in the subway, Marianne Farley(who starred in a very bizarre Canadian-French language thriller 'White Skin' aka 'Cannibel').  He doesn't see it coming, but she's determined to help him with his ordeals and perhaps foster a blossoming love.

This is a family friendly movie- no real language, nudity, sex, violence; although, the movie is geared for adults, all the characters are basically good people and the ending satisfying.  The actors do a nice job.  Predictable and sweet, it's Hallmark, the movie stresses faith, persistence, and love of people.",1297468800,3,1501,5.190871369294606

3886606,5,B002AL2TYM,"This was another totally new movie to us this year--never heard of it before, but really enjoyed it.  As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few scenes with alcohol and someone being drunk, but it is based on a true story so those scenes don't take away from the overall message of hope, forgiveness, charity, and good will.  The story shows the pain that many of us feel at Christmas and the holiday season when we're reminded of deaths and other losses we've experienced.

I'd rate this PG or PG13.  The editing is a little choppy/abrupt because it's made for TV and was made to have commercials between scenes.  Overall it is a keeper in my book--emphasizes the impact of one person's life, and on things that matter most in life.  Heartwarming and genuine, not sappy.  The movie made me look at my own life and at homeless people in a different way (reminded me of the poem about how you spend your life and what will be on your tombstone).

I like that I only recognized Rhea Perlman; it's easier for me to enjoy the story line sometimes when I don't know the actors from other roles they've played.  My vote is:  definitely worth renting and/or buying.",1292198400,2,1162,4.543269230769231

You won't know whats coming when our lead man walks home with a new friend he meets at a bar playing piano. Is it their love
of music that draws these two unlucky friends together or is it much more?Their shared view of humanity. Perfect movie to
make you think about how much good you are doing in the world. And,perhaps even more importantly, to propel you into action. You never
know how the simplest of good deeds can turn someones life around and make you feel better about your own life. It is after all in the
giving that we receive.
My husband and I watched this movie at least 3 times this season. It is definitely a favorite in our collection and will be
the first Christmas movie we watch each season.",1264809600,,837,4.441558441558442

I approached this film because i am a musician  but i did not realise that it was based on truth until the credits rolled. It was not heavy going as a film .At first i thought that the performances were for me steroetypical.  Things shown were too easy to happen  and there was not enough depth of emotions in the whole package.  Maybe it was because the makers wanted a light edged film  I don't know . I think it had all the ingredients for a mini series That way there would have been room for exploring the various characters. However, i did enjoy it .It made me think .  And without wanting to give anything away there was real joy for me to know what happened to these characters.  I intend giving it another look  and hopefully will be able to pick up on things i missed first time around . I guess that in someone elses hands it could have been a much deeper film , more serious , more heartbreaking  because  of its dealings with people who have fallen on bad times,  and the real problems of motivating them .  Would i recommend buying it . Yes i would.. It's a film that has its heart in the right place .and i was so pleased to have come across it .",1261267200,5,1242,4.189873417721519

3886618,5,B002AL2TYM,"""Hitting bottom is when you're all alone and there's no shoulder to lean on.""
""The Christmas Choir"" begins from nothing, the true bottom of the barrel, but the men lean on each other, and on those who, in helping the choir, get help themselves. It's a win-win for Christmas. It's a Hallmark TV channel airing that won two ""Most Inspirational"" awards. And it is that--inspirational.

Workaholic (Peter: Jason Gedrick) gets dumped by fiance.
Workaholic goes to a bar.
Workaholic meets homeless shelter man, Bob (Tyrone Benskin).
Workaholic dreams up ""choir"" idea.
A Hum-Bum choir is not a frequent-flier tale connected to Santa or a nativity.
A unique and true story.

The dramatized events surrounding The Christmas Choir, comprising homeless men, is heartwarming. The story has a side plot of romance, but the basis of the film is forgiveness & giving & transformations & miracles & second chances. That's a lot for one choir and director to accomplish in 84 minutes but they do it, and it works, and it is a delightful way to spend a small portion of your Christmas holiday time.

One surprise recognizable cast member is Sister Agatha played wonderfully by Rhea Perlman who is a habitless nun working at the shelter with the same in-your-face attitude Perlman developed and made famous as a bar-maid on ""Cheers"".  Fun as well as sincere.

Expect NO extras or bonus material except previews of other Christmas DVDs.
But the DVD is a value regardless, a staple in picking up the Christmas spirit.
Low economic times call for low economic Christmas miracles, right?",1259366400,6,1564,4.9541984732824424

3886621,4,B002AL2TYM,"This is a good movie. It isn't just a mindless romance of a single parent at Christmastime--as so many Christmas movies are. There is a romance involved, it just isn't the whole story.

Peter is a workaholic accountant who has just been dumped by his fiancee. He meets a piano player in a bar who can sense he is down and invites him to ""come home"" with him. ""Home"" turns out to be a homeless shelter run by an outspoken nun who is trying to quit smoking. He spends the evening there, makes a donation and leaves, never expecting to return. But after seeing one of the homeless men the next day being pushed along for loitering, he returns to the shelter and helps serve dinner, much to Sister Agatha's surprise. But he wants to do more. On the way home he sees a group of carolers on the street receiving donations. He has an idea and returns immediately to the shelter to discuss it with Sister Agatha. He wants to form a choir as a way for the men to earn some money for Christmas, but there are obstacles along the way. He has to face Sister Agatha's doubts, the men's mistrust of his motives, their lack of training and discipline, his rocky relationship with his father and his own deteriorated personal life.

At first he sees himself as the one doing great things to help these men, but finally comes to see how much they have done to turn his life around. It is an uplifting movie that teaches a good lesson without heavy-handed preaching.

The romance is a gentle thread developing throughout the story. It is never suggestive or inappropriate.
Amazingly, this movie of a rougher side of life has no rough language. I think the term ""brain-fart"" is as bad as it gets, and we hear that only once. Alcohol abuse is dealt with as one choir member shows up to a performance drunk, violating the ""cardinal rule"".  Peter is very angry, words are exchanged and he quits and walks out on the choir. He ends up drunk himself, which is ironic since in an earlier scene he had expressed his frustration with his own father's alcoholism. I can't think of anything else that might be objectionable to anyone. Things look bleak for a time, but are resolved nicely with an upbeat ending.

It is ""based on"" a true story, but take it with a grain of salt. The fine print at the end of the credits indicates that they have fictionalized events for dramatic effect. Still, I think it is a very good Christmas movie that isn't just light fluff--it actually has some meat to it. I would definitely recommend it. The whole family can watch it, though younger children may not grasp the message.",1258070400,50,2582,4.485106382978723
