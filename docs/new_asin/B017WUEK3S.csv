Friends and proud Family members... but I've said it before, and I'll say it again... PLEASE KEEP IT THERE!!! For heavens sake, though!! NOT for the general public, who is expecting (and DESERVE, since we LITERALLY PAY FOR IT through our ""PRIME Membership""), PROFESSIONALLY filmed and produced, entertainment! It's films like these that fill me with the desire to hand my seven and eight year old daughters my video camera for a few days,  rudely edit it into an ""art piece, and see if Amazon Prime will pick it up!! I hate to be so harsh when I'm sure someone worked very hard to bring whatever this was to fruition, but I've also seen some spend DAYS decorating cakes, months on paintings, and years on film projects, that CLEARLY shouldn't be introduced as""""professional work"" and most CERTAINLY should NOT be subject to receive payment for such!!  Please save stuff like this for the people who care about you in your personal life that can truly appreciate your talents and attempts to display them!",1515542400,2,1205,4.844660194174757

8740900,5,B017WUEK3S,"An insightful and mysterious journey into the subconscious.  Gorig does an amazing job of tapping into those thoughts and impressions that are forever on the edges, undefined but forever present, even haunting.  A masterful piece of visual poetry that happily returns as your companion when you least expect it.  And oh, those Red Hook, Brooklyn scenes are short stories within the greater context of the whole movie.  It's both a book and short-story poem.  Beautiful!",1449273600,,469,5.2
8740901,5,B017WUEK3S,Rischa's film takes you on a surreal journey within  a context of the mundane frozen moments  of everyday life  and leaves you with the feeling of how how fleeting  life can be. From  a noir perspective its a eye opener. Highly recommend it.,1448582400,,241,4.511627906976744
8740902,5,B017WUEK3S,"An odd and poignant exploration of personal violation juxtaposed with planetary violation. The protagonist weaves a tapestry of meditation on many issues confronting the world at large and all individuals, trying to make sense of where we are, and what will become of us.",1448150400,,271,5.181818181818182
8740903,5,B017WUEK3S,"Well I have to say this was a strange unusual film. In a good way. It was very visual almost like a painting. The use of certain images like the shadowy dark trees, water and dead leaves to  portray death was amazing. Its an art film.. so it was slow paces but it had  a lot of meaning and thought. . I loved it!.  The dark, moody and surreal dreamlike sequences are beautiful and captivating.  The film is not a lightweight and serves to highlight struggles and conflict for individuals which are both literally and figuratively symbolized in the chaotic and destructive
segments of the film. there is a message here in this film about how we are killing ourselves and our environment in a surreal kind of way. If you liked films like .The Turin horse or The wall or some of the other art film directors..I d say see this film. Its the strangest film that I have seen . I recommend seeing this",1447632000,,894,4.367469879518072
8740904,5,B017WUEK3S,"I really enjoyed watching this film.  Real artwork.  It's a haunting and kind of surreal film.  Many of the images and sequences reminds me of a dream. I like how the film allows you to discover meanings in it, that are unique to what you as an individual project into it.  Too many films tell you what to think and what to feel.  More films should be made like this one, which leaves interpretations of it open to the viewers own mind.",1447545600,,436,4.2682926829268295
8740905,5,B017WUEK3S,"Thank you for your thought and visually provoking film ... a voyage into our continually changing times
I also love the thread of your music compositions that weaves itself in your expression",1447372800,,191,5.0
