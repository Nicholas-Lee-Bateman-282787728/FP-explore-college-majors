8038516,5,B00064K06O,"I watched this video when I was a child and I still remember the Bible verses till this day (I'm 26 now and have a 9 month son of my own). Children still respond to this video, it's fun and filled with good morals, beliefs, and talks about how to talk to God, and what prayer is in simple terms that children can understand and use in there own lives. I recommend it for any family.",1100736000,6,382,4.0394736842105265
