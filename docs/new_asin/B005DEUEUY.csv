Both were not as Suspenseful!
Both were dragged out too long.",1379203200,,110,4.55

8466689,4,B005DEUEUY,I saw these on THIS tv network a few weeksago so aparently these are being released not long after they air.too bad they aren't being done in widescreen hd with surround. It would be nice if they released them on blu ray they could put several on one disc. If anyone who knows someone involved with the production of her show it would be nice if they pass these recomendations on to them.,1316131200,,388,4.328767123287672
8466690,5,B005DEUEUY,"Just in time for Halloween is this great Double Feature DVD featuring two great episodes of ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"".

""Scared To Death"", personally, is my favorite episode from the entire First Season of 2010/2011's ""Movie Macabre""

It is Elvira's Halloween Special!

 Join Elvira as she.....no other way to say it...kidnaps, 'Martha Stewart', and ships her in to help with her Halloween Celebration. 'Martha', as one might expect, is not too pleased by this unexpected journey.

Elvira shows us her exclusive ""Pumpkin Holder"" (not what you think....not exactly), as well as sharing her recipe for a Halloween punch that packs a PUNCH. It'll make you dizzy.

 Elvira also terrifies two kids by changing their Halloween costumes from being fairly kid friendly to becoming...um...NOT so kid friendly.
 Rumor is, the kids are still in therapy.

  As if that isn't cool enough, we get to watch, with Elvira, yet another Halloween icon, Bela Lugosi (Dracula), in COLOR!

  Lugosi stars in ""Scared To Death"", a movie about a woman who speaks from the AfterLife and exposes the suspicious circumstances of her death.

  Also included on the DVD is the movie ""Tormented"". Ok, so this guy has a past with this pretty woman, but he wants to marry ANOTHER pretty woman (He's a bimbo), and when the woman that he doesnt want to marry, finds herself hanging off of a lighthouse railing, the man isn't too fast to help her. Bombs Away!

  The man thinks ""Great news! Now I can marry the woman I want to marry"". Think again.
  The woman who fell to her watery death comes back as a ghost and makes the man's life a nightmare. (Marriage would have done the same thing....no I joke around alot).

 Anyway, the movie is fairly entertaining, but Elvira steals the show with her witty skits and comments.

  If I were a kid, instead of a chocolate bar in my Trick or Treat bag, I'd rather have this fantastic DVD.

  The DVD, ""Scared To Death"" especially, is the perfect Halloween DVD.

Pumpkins. Elvira. Bela Lugosi. Halloween Punch. Martha Stewart (not really)

This is Halloween Heaven.",1314316800,7,2070,4.842406876790831
