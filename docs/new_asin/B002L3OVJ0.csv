8372371,4,B002L3OVJ0,Michael Seale provides a good documentary of the cafe racer scene from its 1950's UK origins to the present day in the US.  Mr. Seale is knowledgeable on his subject and the DVD program is well presented.  I recommend this program to all cafe racer enthusiasts.,1388188800,,261,4.6521739130434785
8372372,5,B002L3OVJ0,Very informative and highly recommend for anyone new to the Caf scene.  Gives one a good perspective on how the early days were.,1372291200,,128,4.565217391304348
8372373,4,B002L3OVJ0,"Not knowing anything about Cafe Racers, this DVD informed me very well and had interesting interviews to detail the history of British bikers---- The Rockers--- who used to meet at the Ace Cafe. Even showed  some of the The Mods who buzzed around on scooters, and the over-exaggerated press coverage of violence between them. I liked the scenes of British bikes revving down back roads, the sound of the engines and the scenic countryside. Only wish there had been more shown, and perhaps some on-bike sounds and sights.",1368316800,,520,4.909090909090909
8372374,4,B002L3OVJ0,"Good DVD covering the history of cafe riders. Overview of the ole Ace Cafe and how the ""Ton Up"" boys got their start. Not too in depth, just a good overview.",1355097600,,157,4.096774193548387
8372375,5,B002L3OVJ0,Great documentary about the history of the cafe racer. Cool bikes and very informative. A must see for all motorcycle enthusiasts.,1334966400,,130,5.238095238095238
8372376,1,B002L3OVJ0,What a terrible self serving pile of crap. Another  self promotion of California hipstesr trying to sell tshirts and jump on a fad as hot as the chopper movement in the late 90s. . Don't waste your hard earned money on this DVD and encourage them to make another terrible reinactment film.,1328313600,,289,4.5576923076923075
8372377,4,B002L3OVJ0,"Nicely produced historical review of the onset of Cafe' Racing in England, roughly paralleling the Chopper scene in the U.S. A small issue, but several scenes are repeated, as if to ""fill"" the narrative by the former English policeman Mark Wilsmore who re-opened the Ace Cafe in London 16 years ago. Several verbal memoirs from 60s-era British rockers and ""ton-up boys"" (have ridden at 100 mph) and lots of video coverage from the early days to the current day scene give a real sense of having been there for the viewer. Sixty minutes of close-ups of bikes and their riders means you'll want to know where the PAUSE and REPLAY buttons are. Highly recommended. Use it to throw a ""Cafe Party!""",1327190400,2,692,4.7272727272727275
8372378,4,B002L3OVJ0,"I started riding in the early '60's. Until then the British motorcycle industry dominated the market. My introduction to 2 wheels was on Japanese bikes, but everywhere I went Triumphs', BSA's, Nortons, Vellocette's etal were present, so I was familiar with them all. What this video did for me was fill the gap until I started riding. The Ace Cafe stories are great. The shots of british bikes that are as popular today as in the past are great. Personal accounts of surviving mods and rockers of the 50's are great. The duplication of scenes is not so great. Why do they think we as consumers and enthusiasts won't notice something like that. With 50 years of footage you would think one and a half hours of video would be easy to come by. Other than that, it is worth the time.",1320278400,,779,4.492957746478873
8372379,5,B002L3OVJ0,"""Cafe Society"" is a great chronicle of an important era in the history of motorcycling and culture. It also does a good job of connecting to and blending in the new resurgence of interest in motorcycles pared down to the essentials. A thoroughly enjoyable way to spend a snowy winter afternoon when you can't get out to ride.",1295827200,7,325,4.620689655172414
8372380,5,B002L3OVJ0,"This is the precusor for the documentary currently running on The History HD Channel. I am unable to get that channel, so I opted to buy this DVD. Very well done with original footage and a great overview of why they are called ""Cafe Racers""...the riders-not the bikes.",1290470400,9,269,4.625
