8051738,2,B0007U1YB2,"We have three ""educational"" music DVDs.  The stand-out favorite is Classical Baby: the Music Show.  The second choice is Trebellina.  This is a distant third: I'd rank Baby Einstein and Laurie Berkner above this in terms of keeping my son interested while exposing him to music.",1261699200,,278,5.0
8051739,5,B0007U1YB2,"My daughter, Alexa, was about three years old when she first watched the music and dance DVDs from Kiddie Village, and she was captivated from the start. She will be four in two months and still watches them. Alexa has never been intrested in the majority of children's movies or other DVDs available on the market, none of which could hold her attention for more than a few minutes. It was such a joy to find Kiddie Village's videos, which are both entertaining and educational. After watching them, Lexi will often put on little shows for me, performing the different dances she has seen, and telling me which musical instruments she is playing. She loves to watch both the dance and music DVDs to this day, and I feel great knowing she is learning so much while being thorougly entertained. Thanks Kiddie Village!",1163808000,4,816,4.713286713286713
8051740,5,B0007U1YB2,"Whenever my 14-month-old is being fussy, I just turn on Fun With Music. It captures her full attention every time! We love listening to the gentle classical and jazz music, watching the puppets, children and instruments, and learning the basics of music (like tempo, timbre and tone-color). This is a must-have for parents who need a break and who want quality edutainment both parent & child can enjoy.",1120003200,3,403,4.9411764705882355
