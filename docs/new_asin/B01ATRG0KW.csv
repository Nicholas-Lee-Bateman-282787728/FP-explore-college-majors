7610393,4,B01ATRG0KW,"I enjoyed this excellent cowboy series on television from 1958 to 1963.  Because it is the best, I wish that they have cleaned it more completely from little white and black ""dust.""  From time to time there were some frames that had long white lines. But it is still worth the money.",1479340800,,283,4.423076923076923
7610394,5,B01ATRG0KW,WE LOVE THE SHOW. WE ARE GLAD IT CAME OUT ON DVD IT TOOK A LONG TIME. BEFORE THIS IT WAS TOO UNA-FORDABLE.,1478563200,,106,3.652173913043478
7610395,4,B01ATRG0KW,"By the time you get to Season 3, the scripts get a bit tired. The novel (1950's new) idea of a man and his son establishing a home is now
firmly established and little is added. The one bit of  bright polish is a story letting Mark lecture his Pa about anger and trying to forgive yourself and do better next time.  I was grateful for that story. The rest were exercises in frustration. Perhaps if the same stories were presented
in season 1 they would not have been so trite.  But, taken in order, I grew bored and stopped watching before I finished the stories. That is too
bad. I may go back in a few months and try again.  Even bad 1960's television is better than the stuff that followed 40 years later.
I would like to see a series today about loving and raising children that is not a silly comedy. Even with the rifle and the Western setting,
this show at least tried to say something good.",1477958400,,898,4.233918128654971
