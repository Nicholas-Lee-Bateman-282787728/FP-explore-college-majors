8200599,4,B000RGX0I6,A decent show.  I personally like BBQ Pitmasters and BBW Pit Wars better but this one is pretty good too.  The judges are not the best.  I would go for a better panel of judges personally,1424649600,,187,4.138888888888889
8200600,3,B000RGX0I6,"I love BBQ and watched every second of this series.  I liked everything about it except the three judges.  They were terrible and here is why:  Their scores seem frequently very arbitrary and you don't feel at the end of the episode that the best competitor won.  The live audience also hates the judges.  You can hear their complaints frequently.  In addition to the poor scoring system, these three judges had absolutely no charisma.  They were rude and self absorbed.  The had no rapport with the competitors, the audience, or each other.  Again I love the concept of this show, and still enjoyed it overall.  I hope the have a season 2, and find better judges!!!!  One of the reasons American Idol has been so successful is due to the interaction of the judges with the audience, competitors, and each other.  Get a clue people!",1284249600,5,832,4.662068965517242
