7901813,5,0982994311,"This video is well put together, gives you a great starting point and lots of things to practice. All in all if your looking for a very informative video as introduction to precision rifles this is what you want. You will not be disappointed!!!!",1358985600,,245,4.590909090909091
7901814,5,0982994311,"This video provides an excellent introduction to building a solid shooting position, finding your natural point of aim, and the breathing and trigger control needed to break a clean shot. All of the instruction concerns shooting from prone. There's no whiz-bang gadgetry, and the skills apply to any rifle with a bipod. This is the video that I wish I had when I started shooting rifles years ago.",1355443200,,397,4.852941176470588
7901815,5,0982994311,"As 223ai mentioned, Jacob was put on this earth to instruct others in the fine art of rifle marksmanship.  This video is about the hardcore, brutal fundamentals of driving a rifle and it will make you a better shooter, no matter what your skill level is.  I have picked up on several areas (breathing and the finer aspects of NPA) that I will be incorporating into my training regime and dry fire practice.  I watched the video in one sitting and will continue to review specific topic areas so as to digest and ingrain the invaluable information that was delivered.  No voodoo, no sales gimics, just brutal fundamentals that will make everyone a better shooter.",1349222400,,662,4.730434782608696
7901816,5,0982994311,"An accurate Rifleman is nothing more than a shooter executing perfect fundamentals consistently, under any and all conditions and positions. While most strive to shoot their rifles accurately, from a bench, few delve into what it takes to execute the basics of marksmanship...which in turn produce accurate results downrange, regardless of the distance. Jacob Bynum, and the crew at Rifles Only, have been put on this earth to develop shooters into true marksmen, and this video is definitely THE starting point. From teaching to get straight behind the gun (recoil management), to trigger control (the most important subject, in my opinion), to Natural Point of Aim, and beyond, this video walks the novice through what it takes...fundamentally....to be accurate on the rifle.

There is no sales pitch for unneeded gear/mounts that don't hold zero and don't work, no focus on gimmicky scope reticles to distract shooters, no focus on one rifle brand, and no voo doo. This video, instead, focuses on making you a better marksmen...from the ground up. Buy it, digest the data, and practice...always.",1348704000,,1098,5.238636363636363
