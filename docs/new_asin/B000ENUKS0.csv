2524453,4,B000ENUKS0,"Here's the deal about Capsule Monsters:

* They're calling it a ""movie"" even though the episodes are the same length as the usual ones, just because the animation style is closer to the movie than anything else.

* It is the first volume of 12 total episodes.

* 4 of those episodes were accidentally aired on Irish television, with episodes 3-4 floating around the web. But if you want the whole story, you'll have to buy this DVD.

* These aren't ""cut"" scenes from the original Japanese; this is an entirely new arc that has not been seen before, and is being released in sync with the new Capsule Monsters tabletop game. It has nothing to do with the video game nor the manga arc of the same name.

* This arc promises to be amusing, but generally is a rehash of all the duels against evil/darkness that you've seen before. It takes place between the Orichalchos/Waking the Dragons arc and the KC Grand Prix/Pharaoh's Memory arcs, so don't expect any reference to either of them.

* Characters like Kaiba, Malik, Isis, etc. will NOT be making an appearance in this arc. The cast is limited to Joey, Tea, Tristan, Yugi, and Grandpa (Solomon Mutou).",1147737600,12,1150,4.585365853658536
2524454,4,B000ENUKS0,"Well-we all knew very well that 4KIDS had gotten at least ""something"" of a successful income from the mildly-famed or infamous (depending on your own point of view) Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light/Yu-Gi-Oh Hikari no Pyramid.  Punch line? You really couldn't expect them ""not"" to pull something like that off again-at least not for a few ""years,"" and that turned out to be very, ""very"" true.

I have personally seen part of this twelve episode O.V.A. ""movie""  (made possible from downloads uploaded from Ireland television-where the first four episodes were aired in secret) entitled Yu-Gi-Oh Capsule Monsters-and pretty much, it's everything you'd expect from 4KIDS, combining the not-so-decent writing from the American Edit version of the Doma Arc series, plus the elemental game properties featured in the Duelist Kingdom series.

Although the first impression of this anime series is corny (and perhaps even unsatisfying) the film does have its funny parts, which include Yuugi's friends doing a parody of ""the can-can,"" along with other various other forms of physical humor through-out the show.  Moreover, it seems that Joey's/Jounouchi's ""classical scenes of ignorance"" never cease to satisfy, even in this.  ^_^

It is still unclear, however if Pegasus, Malik, Bakura, Kaiba or anyone else other than the ""friendship"" crew will be featured in this movie.  One can only hope though... (if Amazon is correct in assuming that this is part ""one"" of a twelve episode series)

The DVD contains many monsters not seen ever before, in glorious animation, such as Aqua Madoor (a monster I have come to love when it comes to the first line of defense in the card game) along with the iniquitous and deadly villain from the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 8: Reshef of Destruction video game (do I really need to say who exactly?). You will also see the return of old favorites, including the Dark Magician and the Celtic Guardian, along with the sweet and irresistibly adorable and cuddly ""Kuribo."" (:

Once again, this DVD will only be amusing to Yu-Gi-Oh fans and ""them"" alone-anyone else (above the age of thirteen or so) may be better off either starting at the beginning of the Yu-Gi-Oh: Duel Monsters series (un-cut version ""highly"" recommended) or just steering clear from this DVD entirely.",1142380800,7,2295,5.096
2524455,4,B000ENUKS0,This is an all new 12 episode series starring Yugi and friends. Not much info is known about it but its a 4Kids project and Yugi and co seem to be in the monster world.,1140566400,2,168,3.8285714285714287
2524456,3,B000ENUKS0,My grandson follows Yugioh and he likes the DVD very much.  I don't know enough about this movie to make any true criticism,1371340800,,123,4.3478260869565215
2524457,3,B000ENUKS0,"My first impression is that at least Amazon is good enough to clarify this, because the box certainly doesn't state ANYWHERE that it is only a ""Part 1"" of 2.  My second impression is, at least I got it in a bargain bin, because I don't feel like I got a ""full-length feature film.""

Diehard fans of the series should already know exactly what they're going to get: Yugi and friends play a game--specifically, the title game of Capsule Monsters.  It's laughably campy not only in terms of how the characters interact, and how predictably, but also in that ancient Egyptians were all about making single-theme board games for future generations to rip off (""Hey, why worry about if there's enough water for the crops this year? We could be making arm guns that shoot capsules that hold monsters!"").  It's pretty much six regular television episodes strung together into a single ""movie"", which you might be able to guess from the sluggish-for-a-movie pacing, and it definitely leaves a feeling of being cheated without that critical ""Part 1"" knowledge.

What fans won't get is an option to hear the original Japanese audio tracks, so if you're not a fan of dubs, look elsewhere.  Overall, exactly what I expected--or, Part 1 of what I expected, I suppose--but definitely bare bones.  If all you expect to see is more of the show, that's precisely what you'll get.",1318204800,2,1361,4.7905982905982905
2524458,5,B000ENUKS0,"If you love YU-GI-OH,then you got to have this one!
Bursting with adventure right from the beginning, it will keep you interested from beginning to end. So it's not like you have to wait for a villian or a bad guy to show up to duel like the other shows. In this movie it's more fun because the monsters,e.g capsule monsters in this realm, actually talk! I was very surprised when I heard Dark Magician say, ""Behold, the source of the storm,"" when he was helping Yami pass one of the five trials.
It also has several 'other' monsters that you might not have never seen on the other movies. Monsters like happy lover and Thunderkid(that yellowish lizard), dark witch and Aqua Mador.
Love YU-GI-OH? Then buy this! It will not bore you, I guarantee it.
You just gotta buy it!",1285632000,,772,4.4822695035460995
2524459,3,B000ENUKS0,"This DVD contains episodes 1-6 edited into a 95 minute-long movie-like presentation. If you have never seen the episodes themselves, then the DVDs are great to watch, with an excellent story and moral. If, on the other hand, you liked the humor and flow of the episodes, then the DVDs tend to be dissapointing. Many scenes are noticibly spliced, many pieces of dialog and backstory removed, and the deleted scenes archive on each DVD doesn't even touch all of the little things they cut out just to make the movie a few minutes shorter. Horror of horrors, they even spliced the infamous ""Victory Dance"" scene, perhaps one of the most popular moments in the whole mini-series. On the other hand, if you liked the mini-series and want to own even a badly cut copy of your own, the DVDs are the only official release and the only way to get a DVD of Capsule Monsters. It would have been great if someone in the office of the DVD manufacturer had considered this and made the DVDs with an option to watch it in the more complete ""episode form"", but since they didn't, you are left with a choice of buying these DVDs or downloading the episodes at the cost of video quality. Hopefully next time the people who make these DVDs will remember that some fans like the shows just they way they aired on TV, without many humorous comments removed and scenes heavily spliced.

An example of the editing:
Tristan: Friend of yours?
Tea: (nods) Uh-huh, it's that monster from the board game. Isn't he cute?
Tristan: Sure. But the stubby mutant lizard, not so much.
Thunder Kid looks exasperated.
(DVD stops here and cuts to the next scene, but the episode continues)
Tea: Tristan was just kidding, _wasn't he_?
Tristan: ...Of course...
Tea: You see?
Thunder Kid dances around happily.
Tristan sighs.",1176854400,,1784,4.681528662420382

Egear as ever, Tristan and Joey march of into the jungle dragging a unhappy tea and Yugi behind them.

Joay as usuall, gets into trouble by stepping on a map which transports him to another world. Yugi and the others soon follow. Yugi and co. then find themselves battling for their lives as they must overcome 5 tests in order to return home. I recommand this to any Yu-Gi-Oh fan, and to anyone who wants a good action anime movie. Never a dull moment, and Yugi looks REALLY cool when he combines with his monsters!!;)",1158796800,,776,4.471830985915493
2524461,4,B000ENUKS0,"I wasn't sure what to expect, I didn't even know there was a mini series until I saw a commercial advertising the series coming to the US. I love Yu-Gi-Oh! for both the collectible card game aspect and the fact that there's a story arc with a rich plot, even if the American translations have a lot of filler and silly moments.

This takes place probably just after the Grand Championship, as the Pharaoh is still with Yugi. The four friends and Grandpa find themselves transported to another world, via a pyramid thought to have been built by Alexander the Great, and thrust into another Shadow Game, the world of Capsule Monsters. Since weird happenings are the norm for them, they manage to pick things up fairly quickly. This DVD is the first of two to be released (the 2nd in September 06 I think) so it does stop in the middle, but not on a cliffhanger.

The extras were interesting, but non-essential. Most unique about the series, like the virtual world in the dueling series, is that everyone plays--Tea, Tristan and Grandpa Moto all end up finding Capsule Monsters of their own and making relevant contributions, though Yugi and the Pharaoh are clearly the stars with Joey a close second.

I look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes, or waiting for them to be broadcast in the states.",1154995200,2,1301,4.623376623376624

2524463,4,B000ENUKS0,"Well, even though it's 90 minutes long, it is most definitely not a movie... it's more like an extended episode.  The animation is not that of what I would consider a feature length film to be, Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie was much much better in the animation department and ran much smoother than the stuff aired on TV.  This just looks like another episode on TV... which, for the most part, was relatively decent.  The story-line moves at a blistering pace, which seems to take some of the fun out of discovering a whole new world, which is where the ""Capsule Monster"" series is based.  Yugi and his pals seem to figure out how everything works a lot quicker than they should have, as they pretty much master the use of their capsule monsters by the time we're half-way through the film, leading up to a rather lackluster climax at the end, if it can be called an ""end"" or not.

The ending is not really an ending at all, it is left wide open for the rest of the Capsule Monster series to take place, which will be aired on US television later in '06, and is already being aired in other English speaking countries.  Overall, if you're a Yu-Gi-Oh! fan, than this is a no-brainer... you have to own it.  And for a price of under $10, it's a real bargain!  I honestly can't wait to see the other episodes when they air on TV.  My review may have sounded a little harsh, but I was expecting this to be a film that would be able to not only be mostly stand-alone, but would also add to the Capsule Monster story.  I guess I was expecting too much?  Anyways, a great buy for any Yu-Gi-Oh! fan.",1153785600,2,1583,4.296296296296297

The only tiny thing missing was Kaiba.  As much as the original series was super fantastic wonderful, this one takes it up a notch.  I rented it and now I'm buying two copies.  I'm floored by what a good job they did.  The theatrical release has nothing on this.  This is what should have been in the movies.  This is good.  Buy it.  Watch it a dozen times.

The art is great, the action is enough to make me stick with the TV, and there is also many funny parts as well, you know who I mean right? I'm not regret just to register into 4kids to see it online. I'm not buying the movie yet, I'm going to wait until Japan have it. The movie is so GREAT, better than dueling alot! This one only have 12 episodes, but I hope they have more, but oh well, better than to have nothing.

PS: Did I mentioned that Yami looked really really hot in the Dark Magician armor :p I know he's going to have more armor in another 6 epi.",1148774400,3,647,3.976923076923077

While on vacation, a mysterious man tricks Yugi's gang into searching a pyramid for Yugi's missing grandfather.  They accidently uncover a world of Capsule Monsters.  Upon reuniting, our heroes begin solving clues and riddles, playing the bigger game of trying to find their way home by completing five tests of courage and honor.  They must use their monsters and the terrain with strategy.  Yugi gains a special gold armor allowing him to merge with his favorite monsters, but drains his energy.  Each of the group has a monster or two with special abilities, flight, healing, etc.  Same typical fun.  It's a fight for their lives in each new world.  So what's the real plot at work here, who will win the power of the king?  What do Yugi's recurring nightmares point to?

2524469,5,B000ENUKS0,"I just watched this and i think it was top notch. If you watched the Yu-Gi-Oh Movie, you know it was pretty much one giant duel. But this is so much more. I don't know the background of this series but it was funny and entertaining and surprisingly without any cards this show has a lot more action. It is kind of like the few episodes when there minds get sucked into kaibas video game. Only know lifepoints, and there are no weak monsters. They all have their own strengths and even tristans little duck creature can take down some big huge monsters. The only problem with this movie is...No ending. I know there will be a second part or so, but i cant find any info on when it will come out. I would definitely reccomend this, its only $10 and you get a good chunk of a non-dueling Yu-Gi-Oh. That almost never happens.",1148601600,2,821,4.303225806451613
2524470,5,B000ENUKS0,I saw this moive yesterday at 4kids .com all I could say was wow. I realy enjoyed this movie I can't wate to buy it. It went by so fast that next thing I know it was 6pm. Good job 4 kids tv.,1148342400,2,190,3.441860465116279
8111840,4,B000ENUKS0,"The four-star rating is not of the actual anime, but the disc(s). It's rather glitchy upon start up. It will play the FBI Warning and other credits and then turn off. I'll have to stop it and play again for it to continue to the main menu. There's apparently deleted scenes as bonus features, but it will never play them! (This also happened on Part Two as well.)

As for Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters itself, this is personally my favorite saga of the anime. I love the different aspect to the normal method of Duel Monsters. And honestly, Capsule Monsters makes more sense to me as it's more of a direct, physical battle. (The monsters are held inside capsules that are fired from an apparatus on the player's arm. The players also feel the physical pain that their monsters feel, so the stakes are much higher.
(It's like a Shadow Game, but without the dark magic of the Millennium Items.)

The story goes as follows, Yugi has a disturbing nightmare and awakens to find his Millennium Puzzle behaving strangely. He also finds that his grandfather hasn't returned from an expedition like originally planned. Meanwhile, Joey wins the Yugi-tachi tickets to a trip to India. With any other group of teens, it would go smoothly, but for Yugi and the gang, things quickly get out of hand. They end up stranded inside a pyramid somewhere in India that holds the world of the Capsule Monsters. Is Solomon Mutou inside the pyramid too? Will it explain why the Millennium Puzzle is acting weird? How will they all escape in one piece or better yet, alive?

A lot of fans are somewhat upset because Kaiba does not play a role in Capsule Monsters. Fortunately for me, I love that fact.  (It's one of the main reasons why I love this saga. Sorry, but I'm NOT a Kaiba fan!) If you're a Kaiba fan, you'll be disappointed.

If you're one of the lucky ones who were able to view the deleted scenes, great! Me, not so great!
