I am very picky about what my kids watch, and I love these too (i always wished when i was little that my stuffed animals would move and talk!). I appreciate that the animation is done by real solid objects moving, in realistic colors, moving at speeds that match a child's thinking, unlike so many computer-animated shows available for children. And that the christmas presents are true gifts associated with shared memories. They're great stories!",1274140800,2,557,5.2

I guarantee you will love it!  The animals are sweet, kind, and so appropriate for children.",1207440000,3,248,4.466666666666667
