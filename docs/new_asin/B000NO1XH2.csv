8179428,5,B000NO1XH2,"I love this show.  I'm sorry that it was cancelled after the fifth season, but it's great fun.
The attitudes of the characters are so snarky and fun.  You have Bid Ed Deline (James Caan), who is a tough guy with a sense of humor and enough softness to him that you don't hate him.  His second Danny McCoy (Josh Duhamel), that plays smart and stupid just so well.  James Lesure as Mike Cannon, the player that really is just too smart he's dumb.  If that's not enough there is the cast of women that rounds out this amazing cast as gambling, sex and money are motivators for this fun and funny show.",1275177600,,598,4.256637168141593
8179429,5,B000NO1XH2,I just recently started to watch this show with my husband and he told me how interested he was in it. I decided to purchase the First season to see how & where it all began. I purchased it as a gift for hubby but I think I am enjoying it more than him. What's better is that it came with season 2 and we've watched them so much that we're just about done so we decided to get seasons 3&4 as well. Well worth the purchase!,1200096000,,422,3.8620689655172415
