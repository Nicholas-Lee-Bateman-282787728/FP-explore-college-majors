For example, this is all you will be told about where it was filmed: northeast Greenland.  There will be no info on where the expedition left from, no maps showing where it went, etc.  As for when it occurred, no info on that either - there is a blurb at the beginning informing the viewer that some fjords of northeast Greenland are [now] open a few weeks a year - from that one may guess that this takes place in the summer of a recent year relative to the copyright date of the film (2013).

One would think that the inference that the access is only recent (ostensibly a result of less ice blocking the area) would make a bit of climate background helpful, but no, there is none of that either.

There are inferences that the area they are entering is unexplored, but what do they find at the ""end of the world?"" - a modern ship (the expedition itself is on a sailing vessel) flying what appears to be a Finnish flag.  The characters in the story inform us (without documentation) it is a petroleum exploration ship (the ship itself has no clear corporate logo/markings).  Another thing that blows the ""unexplored"" inference is that they also visit a prefab hut (being accosted by a polar bear) that was clearly shipped in/constructed in recent years.

So whatever else this is, it's not an expedition into unexplored territory, unless you take the meaning that the areas visited had not been visited by this particular group of people in the past.  By such definition, if you have never been to Miami, it is unexplored.

So what's this film about?  Apparently it's just about the opinions and musings of the scientists and artists on the voyage displayed against a background of very nice scenery.  Mostly they make observations/speculations about the role of humankind on planet earth.

But of the things I would like to have known - stuff about the ship itself, the recent climate history of the area and how it has changed, why the expedition was planned, explanation of what they were looking for in the various fishing, coring, rock collecting activities and so on - nada.",1426723200,5,2161,4.640419947506562
