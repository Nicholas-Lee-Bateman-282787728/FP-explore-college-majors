2598988,4,B000G1R4V6,"This is a very good DVD and I recommend it to anybody who is ignorant of the true destructive nature of war and/or any form or violent injury caused by bombs and guns etc. Also the  dedication of the health workers is great to see. However, as a doctor working in South Africa, its irritating to me to see DVDs being made to show the horrors of war and destructive injury like that kinna thing is unique to a war.  Many state hospitals in South Africa, which is not a wartorn country, or any country in Africa for that matter will ussually have all the same injuries or FAR FAR worse, FAR more regularly in a FAR greater number of people with FAR less medical facilities and FAR less health professionals working to keep up with the ridiculous patient load. People need to know that you don't need to find a warzone to find this kind of thing. Just find your nearest 1st world exploited 3rd world country and you'll see it clear as day and nobody sees that on HBO. This is not to take anything away from the quality of this DVD or the great work being done by the health workers in Iraq. Oh yeah....... and what ARE YALL DOING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE??!!!! The best thing that can come from this DVD is to show 'those people' in the US who support the current administration the result of their decisions. But I predict NO GOOD will come of it as we've seen the same thing over and over again over the decades despite the results.",1154304000,6,1431,4.296296296296297
2598989,5,B000G1R4V6,I am a physician in the Army and have worked in this facility during OIF.  This film is graphic but nowhere near as graphic as it could be.  It is quite uplifting and moving.  It is also very tastefully done and not in the least exploitative considering the subject matter.  It made me very proud of the job we do.

But there were a few that we could not save, it hurt then and watching this bad ass film reminds me how much it hurt.

If you can't handle graphic injury, don't watch it.
If you are or were a doc like I was, you will likely love it and truly be moved, or will have flashbacks, or both.
If you have PTSD, consider that prior to watching as this may dredge up things that you may not be ready for.

My soldiers and veterans of all branches, my heart appreciates you more than I can say.

The Marine who passes away at the end: His mom was able to view the unedited footage of her sweet boy's final moments as he gave himself for our freedom. She was thankful for the experience because she got to see how he was loved, how hard they tried, and that he was not alone when he died.

It is fairly gory in places, but the film makers obviously tread a fine line and were careful not to overdo.  It is heartbreaking, and as before, made my stomach and chest tighten painfully.  These soldiers are, for the most part, a few years from being children, and the doctors and nurses, medivac personnel and paramedics all know this and have to find ways to cope.  It is beautifully done, and the juxtaposition of the beautiful Green Zone and the horrible fighting within sight of it are surreal.

This is specific to the medical care received after arrival at hospital and does not include the care given by 'on the scene' medics who make decisions that are crucial to saving lives. Wounds caused by any form of IED are both physically and emotionally traumatic. In a way these injuries are all the more personal for medical personnel because they are not mass causalities but a steady flow of injured individuals. The scope of injuries sustained varies from those with no physical trauma to the 'buddy' that is killed in a horrific manner . . . not a simple thing to reconcile.

If you are not familiar with military medicine, this offers an accurate description of injuries and treatment . . . a good overview of in hospital care.

2599075,4,B000G1R4V6,"We have forgotten that war should only be a last resort.  Although the data on casualties and wounded is far better than any other war, it still doesn't matter. If anything, this documentary gives some perspective on how brutal WWII and other wars we have entered must have been with zero sanitation, and no way to treat trauma. A lot more death.  This is the real deal.

It made me feel mad, based on what is going on right now in Iraq (at time of writing Sunni-Shiite civil war June 15, 2014), all gains lost, in a war that for the first time, we started on our own.  To what end. I feel more angry about the IED's. Although not practical, I don't understand why our people weren't protected by M1A2 Abrahms, and very thick armor making it nearly impossible to injure the crew.  The more we sent Humvee's to try and stop IED's, the more IEDs hit Humvees and more soldiers got killed or badly maimed.  Note of interesting detail, while the Marines were in unbelievably good shape, the Army guys seemed 25-50% overweight. I don't know how that is allowed. But they were strong anyway. Who knows what difference that makes.

 I just don't understand why we did the same thing over and over again---> sending Humvee's to have IEDs find them rather than the other way around. I would have changed tactics  and certainly not taken the same path every day, so the enemy had time to dig in another and another and another.  Simple RF jamming devices would have helped which came on later. But we could have made stronger transportation. None of those IEDs could have damaged an Abrahms, though as I mention, not practical at 2 mpg.

There is one scene where every foot of the center divider along the road they drove along had been damaged by an IED over and over and over other Humvees killing and maiming even more soldiers. Looks to me like we needed more collateral damage and secured that highway 24/7. Anyone on there dies.  Again outsmarted by low-tech stuff rather than defeating it with high tech. Forward sonar and radar. Constant overflights or simply destroying the whole area so one one can get injured because it is secure.",1402790400,,2131,4.564304461942257

It centers on a surgical unit treating members of this unit who come to grief from various nefarious means.  The message it left me with was ""what in the world are we doing there in the first place""?  Recent events add further proof to the fact that our politicians and military leaders just do not understand the middle-eastern philosophies and fail to realize that we are the agressors and strange invaders in a strange land.  We have no business going back and should pull out of both Iraq and Afghanistan.

The documentary is not vouyeristic or exploitive. It has no apparent 'agenda'.

But it leaves you feeling pretty grim to know that these events are occuring every day in Iraq. Every day dozens of young Americans are being smashed up. Not to mention the hundreds of Iraqi civilians being butchered.

Me and the NCOIC of the E.R. featured in this documentary are responsible for the actions taken by medics in this film.  People talk a lot about doctors and nurses.  In the military, medics are the ones who make things happen.  There are no nurses or doctors patrolling downtown Baghdad with an infantry platoon.  Those medics out there reacted and took care of their fellow soldiers.  Seeing that they needed additional medical care they sent them to us.  The 86th CSH.

I'm not the political type and I don't care what people say out there.  I just do my job and I think I do it well.  I was tasked to train my medics in traumatic emergency medicine, ensure that they knew their job and that the E.R. ran smoothly.  We worked around the clock, two 12 hours shifts, no days off, trying to save every Soldier's life.  Not only our Soldiers but anybody injured.  I called my guys the silent and unseen angels.  Why?  A lot of the Soldiers who came through our doors never saw us or knew who we were.  Simply because we treated them, then they went to the O.R. and then they were shipped to Germany.  Baghdad E.R. shows what we did for our Soldiers.

I'm proud of the soldiers I worked with and the hard work and sacrifices they went through during that year long deployment in Iraq.  Not to brag about ourselves but we had the best trauma team worlwide.  After our deployment ended we learned that the survivability was close to 95%.  Unfortunately now I work in a clinic and I'm not allowed to go back to Iraq where I know I can be more efficient and would be able to take care of our wounded.

But this film is the best HBO can portray of what we did.

The other reviewers all made good points about the merits of this film.  I heard the directors interviewed on NPR, and they mentioned the trauma they were feeling being witnesses to all of that suffering.  The only shortcoming of this film is that we don't get much of a feel for the suffering of ordinary Iraqis, which is absolutely massive.  Estimates vary, but hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died - many due to the millions of rounds of bullets our troops and private mercenaries have fired.  One study noted that many Iraqis died from A-10 Warthog and Apache helicopter attacks, while many others have died in the ensuing chaos of this illegal invasion and occupation.  We can barely begin to imagine how many Iraqis have been horribly injured, or what the scenes are like inside the actual emergency rooms of Baghdad, Falluja, Tikrit, Ramadi and many other towns.  Just today, I heard that the Iraqi health system is near collapse.  One of the first things the US Air Force bombed during ""shock and awe"" was the Ministry of Health.  Meanwhile, many Iraqi doctors are among the 2 million Iraqis who have fled the country for their lives.  Of those emigres to Jordan and Syria, it's estimated that 50,000 women and girls have been prostituting themselves to survive.
PTSD rates for Iraqi children are astronomical.
The list of death and misery goes on and on, as does the list of ways people can defy the militarists who serve the interests of transnational corporations - not America.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes/dp/B00006L2TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes!</a>

""Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.  The world in arms is not spending money alone.  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hope of its children . . .

2599096,5,B000G1R4V6,"I had the privilege of viewing this documentary in the company of a roomful of Marine parents at a national conference this past summer, including the mother of one of the young men who didn't survive the injuries he sustained.  There wasn't a dry eye in the auditorium.  One of the directors, Matthew O'Neill, was available for questions and while we were composing ourselves, he explained that the purpose of this documentary was pretty much to present a non-political film about the workings of a Army hospital in the middle of a war zone and to also show the compassion and skill of the nurses and doctors that were on duty and who cared for our sons and daughters.  You also see that most times, the wounded are more concerned about their buddies who were with them than their own injuries.  This film is graphic and there were times when I had to look away from the screen but we were told that they had toned it down considerably, but couldn't do more without losing the reality of the specific situations they filmed.  The mother of the marine that didn't make it spoke of how she came to meet the director and through doing so and viewing footage of her son's final moments, it gave her closure which she hadn't felt before.  No matter what you think about the Iraq situation, I doubt this film will alter your opinion either way, but it will give you a sense of ""being there"" and some empathy for the medical personnel that care for our military wounded.  It also gives you the understanding that it doesn't matter if the wounded are ours, theirs or the enemy - they are all treated with human dignity and if they can, they will save a life.

2599097,3,B000G1R4V6,"This documentary does an excellent job showing what happens at the combat support hospital in Baghdad's Green Zone.  However, it completely ignores all echelons of care that a wounded soldier receives before arriving at the CSH.  The film makes no mention of medical personnel who are on the ground with the soldiers when situations like a roadside bomb or IED detonation occurs.  It also ignores the fact that many of the casualties coming into the CSH have already received a good deal of stabilizing treatment at smaller aid stations of forward support hospitals.  Don't get me wrong, I will be the first to admit that those physicians and physician assistants at the CSH indeed save lives, but their job would be impossible without the courageous work of far forward medical personnel, such as combat line medics.  Line medics put their own lives on the line to be the first responders.  They preserve and sustain a casualty's life by providing stabilizing treatment on the scene of an attack so that the casualty can have a fighting chance to survive an air or ground evacuation to the CSH.  This documentary gives the false impression that this hospital is the first line of care a casualty will see and soldiers are pulled directly off the 'fighting lines' to this hospital when that, in fact, is not the case.",1157241600,15,1317,4.826666666666667

This film,. while very short on time, showcases the reality of war.  While the media mentions how many were killed in an attack, they fail to bring home the reality that many more are wounded in devastating ways.  If more people would understand what combat wounds look like, I think there would be less enthusiasm for war.

The film is a ""fly on the wall"" look at a combat care facility in Baghdad. The voices in the movie are not actors.. there is no narration.  You get to watch and listen to what's happening and engross yourself as if you were truly there.  I spent two years in the military training ordinary medical personnel to work in these facilities and I can assure you that this film is about as graphic and in-your-face as you will want to see.  As the previous reviewer stated, it could have shown a lot worse, but it's not necessary.  There is enough here to make a lasting impression.

While the film focuses mainly on the ER (as the title suggests), it would have been nice to show a bit more of the other personnel who make this system work.  The field medics, the ancillary services, the public health and a whole host of other people who donate a portion of their lives, and a larger portion of their heart to saving lives for their country.  But with the 1 hour time limit, the producers managed to give you a quick glimpse into a scene very few have seen, and even fewer will ever want to.
