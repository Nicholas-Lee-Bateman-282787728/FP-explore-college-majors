7906538,4,B00000F204,"One of my favourite comedies.  Have looked for it for many years following the loss from my library.  Found it here.  In my view, one of Wilder's best productions, along with The Producers and Young Frankenstein.",1260921600,,212,4.833333333333333
7906539,1,B00000F204,"Fans of Mr. Wilder seem to like this movie, and if you like loud comedy you probably will like this one as well. As a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I did not. Holmes is a rare hero of the introvert, and this movie was quite noisy. You should analyse your preferences, loud comedy or cerebral mystery. I have doubts that most Sherlock Holmes fans will enjoy this film.",1235001600,2,361,4.323529411764706
7906540,4,B00000F204,"This movie is nuts! I'm not sure that i can describe what the movie is about but i'll try. Sherlock Holmes' brother is intrigued by a woman to find a missing document. Otherwise I'm really at a loss on what else it is about. The movie stars some of the funniest people of all-time including Gene Wilder,Madeline Khan,Marty Feldman and Dom Deluise. The movie is hilarious,eventhough the story is confusing. Like i said,it's nuts,but in a good way. The cast bursts out in song and dance out of nowhere and for no real reason,Wilder and one of the bad guys(the father of veruca salt in willy wonka and the chocolate factory)fight atop horse and carriages during a chase with large feet and hand props,wilder and feldman appear suddenly in a large ballroom of people dancing(the outcome of this scene alone is worth the price of admission),and Wilder has to turn-on Khan sexually in order to get the truth out of her,all work in this insane comedy. Deluise is another who gets to put in a memorable performance,but is underused unfortunately. If you are a Wilder fan it should be noted that he also wrote and directed this. It's one of the funniest films i've ever seen but it's not perfect like almost all comedies. The story isn't clear,and maybe that's part of it's charm,but the ending is a disappointment,which always hampers a film. All in all I'd definitely watch this again for the laughs and i recommend this film to everyone as well. I'm betting that most have never even heard of this film and that is a shame as it should not be forgotten.",1126224000,5,1547,4.629090909090909
7906541,5,B00000F204,"This film, which served as a money laundering front for the Brooks-Kahn machine, was never intended as anything but a ruse to dupe the authorities into thinking that something other than monkey business was going on here.

Unfortunately, said monkey business soon made its presence known.  Dom Deluise squealed, and now ""Papa"" Brooks languishes under house arrest, never to con us with the ""World's Oldest Man"" ruse ever again.  Meanwhile, Deluise, forced to enter the FBI's eyewitness protection program, has once again resurfaced as a Louisiana chef.  Only time will tell how that criminal mastermind will reward ""Chef Paul"" for his loyalty.

What kept this film from the success of ""Young Frankenstein"" or ""Blazing Saddles"" is the conspicuous absence of some really raunchy toilet humor.  ""Papa"" Brooks was apparently too preocupied with his new chain of pachinko parlors to contribute in that way.  The slapstick is a little too subtle for some people, but hey, wup-wup-wup!

Both Wilder and Dom are so indescreet as to grab a boobie or two when Madeleine is within groping distance, but hey, it's all in the name of slapstick.  I have shown a similar weakness, but like them, also for a higher purpose.  My girlfriend doesn't seem to respect my true intentions, but the effect is the same regardless.  There are no exposed ones (i.e., boobies) or other naughty bits, and there is virtually no foul language or overtly trashy behavior so prevalant in movies nowdays.  Much of this humor is best appreciated by adults, but not in the sense so popular now; that children should be protected from seeing it.  Wather, it simply wequires a teensy bit of matuwity to appweciate the jokes fully, or at least a tiny portion of them.

But I thought this was ripping funny as a child too.  This movie is one of the best that the 1970s had to offer in the way of comedy.  It is a prized childhood memory to me, and an all-around wholesome comic experience, unlike so many films today.  If you like Brooks, Bette Midler, Three's Co., or Carol Burnette, I think this flick will have something for you.",1109116800,5,2092,4.815126050420168
7906542,4,B00000F204,"I bought this movie as a gift for my dad as our family loves this film! I watched it a lot as a child. Once again, Gene Wilder had part in a film where the humor was way ahead of its time! Classic good family fun. We all enjoyed reliving the scenes & quoting the whole movie like fools. I would recommend it to all ages. *NOTICE THERE ARE RARELY ANY FOR SALE, I RECEIVED A FAKE (COPY) THAT JUMPS AND SKIPS AND WAS DISAPPOINTED-KNOW YOUR SELLER ON THIS ITEM!",1091577600,5,457,4.088888888888889
7906543,5,B00000F204,"The Opera scene alone is worth the price of the VHS edition! As a long time musician and Gene Wilder fan, I had to find this film again. Now if they would only release a DVD edition.",1089504000,2,182,3.945945945945946
