8275990,5,B001A481OM,"I had reviewed this video a couple of years ago but for some reason it never appeared.  ???  I really enjoy this Winsor Pilates routine along with the longer 45 minute partner to it, Total Body Workout (on the same disc). In 20 minutes Mari uses the mini-ball to hit almost every muscle.  It is mildly challenging to the core (because of the short duration) but a very nice dynamic stretch for the whole body.  The mini-ball adds a bit of balance challenge while you are on the mat which forces the core muscles to engage more.  The longer routine, on the same disc, is more challenging.  I could have done without the ""Accelerated Fat Burning"" workout, which I already own via the Dynamic Sculpting Circle series.  I prefer the mini-ball to the Magic Circle because the ball doesn't pinch between the thighs, it has a lot of versatility and it just adds an element of fun.

At this time, to my knowledge the video is only available from places like Amazon Marketplace.  If you are a fan of Mari's and do not have this and the companion workout, snap it up now!  But read my review with a gain of salt - I am biased toward Mari's workouts.  I like her despite her quirks and for some reason her routines make my back feel wonderful.

By the way, my purchase did not include the Winsor mini-ball.  Any Pilates overball or even a child's play ball will suffice, and there are mini-balls available from other Pilates and exercise vendors.",1306627200,7,1435,4.494208494208494
8275991,5,B001A481OM,"This workout is fun, effective and the best part, it is only 20 minutes.  I had no idea it even exsisted and now that I have it, it was one of the best purchases I have made.  I love working with the ball, it makes the workout challenging and more interesting.  The seller was fast and the price was extremely reasonable.  Who could ask for anything more?",1267660800,,355,4.253731343283582
