8325307,3,B000KKPFU0,"I bought this Australian import for ""Black Emanuelle"" as this seems to be the only edition available, which is quite strange.  This dvd clocks in at 92 minutes, which is about right for the original version.  The picture is actually widescreen, but this is simply a direct copy from the British VHS that offered the widescreen picture.  Apparently this version is censored, but only by 30 seconds, roughly.  The picture quality is quite poor, but watchable, especially since this is the only way to see this iconic piece of exploit cinema, the original film that spawned countless sequels and rip-offs.  I thought $30 was a bit steep for a title that hasn't been remastered, and has no extras, but this is a rare title, so I guess I can understand.  I am grateful to have any edition of 'Black Emanuelle,"" a film that I have wanted to see for as long as i can remember.  Also, this is wrongly listed here as PAL format, when it is in fact NTSC, with no region coding, so it will play on north American players.",1219104000,8,1010,4.516483516483516
