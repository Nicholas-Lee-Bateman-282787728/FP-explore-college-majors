2168272,5,B00064NP5C,"Es un curso de ingl&eacute;s verdaderamente entretenido y pr&aacute;ctico. Todas las lecciones est&aacute;n basadas en situaciones cotidianas de la vida real.  Se aprende en base a di&aacute;logos, sin notas de gram&aacute;tica aburridas o dif&iacute;ciles de entender.

Una de las secciones m&aacute;s &uacute;tiles del DVD es la de notas culturales que ayuda a los latinos a entender las palabras y expresiones en el contexto de la cultura norteamericana.

Es una gran herramienta de estudio para cualquiera que ya tiene las nociones b&aacute;sicas y necesita refrescar y expandir sus conocimientos, especialmente para conversar con fluidez.",1100476800,8,643,5.89247311827957
2168273,4,B00064NP5C,"'El Ingles de Hoy' makes learning English enjoyable for the Spanish speaker.  Using authentic scenes and realistic dialog, the learner is transported into various scenes: making reservations on the phone, ordering at a restaurant, using postal services, shopping and attending a business party.

 The dialogs are shown in context, then  they are broken into practice chunks to repeat  in both word-by-word and full utterance formats. It is easy to review sections.

 Effective use of a native  Spanish speaker on the `Inside Track' feature, guides the learner through  cultural differences and explains the quirks of spoken English.

 The accompanying ' cuadernillo' (notebook) lists all the dialog and translation in addition to a glossary, contraction dictionary and the `Inside Track' notes.  This is a learner friendly, easy to navigate,  high quality DVD for Spanish speakers wanting to learn or improve their English.  L. Bloom Certified ESL Instructor",1100131200,19,958,5.517241379310345

8038613,1,B00064NP5C,"This does not teach everyday situation vocabulary. It should have used some real life common situations so the learner could start using what they learned. It is based on making reservations at restarants, hotels,and a professional business office party meeting people. The places I go eat do not require reservations, I seldom need to stay at a hotel, and can't remember the last business party I was at if ever. It would be difficult for a new learner to figure out how to use the few words it teaches. I bought this to give to a new Spanish friend but it would be a waste of her time.",1314144000,5,587,4.444444444444445

8038615,1,B00064NP5C,"This product is useless except for learners who pre-possess a high degree of English proficiency.  The situations presented are few and highly unlikely to be of any use in learning conversational English.  Are you ready to make reservations over the phone?  Do you have friends or a job that requires you to travel and meet business associates.  If you answer yes, you don't need this.  If you answer no, this will not help you.",1299196800,2,428,4.72972972972973

8038617,5,B00064NP5C,"I'm an ESL instructor and have used this video in the classroom. El Ingles de Hoy is not for beginning students but for those at the literacy level with some previous ESL instruction.  Overall, I found the video to be a practical tool that helps motivated learners gain conversational proficiency.  The video presents several common situations and introduces vocabulary and phrases appropriate for that situation.  In this way, it helps students apply classroom knowledge to real-life scenarios.  I would also recommend this video for self-instruction as the video comes with a dual-language instructional booklet.",1188950400,10,614,5.5

Para hablar con seguridad y entender con precisin en cualquier situacin, especialmente de la vida social y de negocios.  Viene con una gua impresa que incluye todas las frases en ingls y espaol para poder seguir los dilogos sin perder palabra.  Lo mejor de este DVD no es lo que incluye sino lo que excluye, no tiene nada que no sea aplicable. Para personas con poco tiempo libre que necesitan ir al grano y aprender frases y nociones tiles para mejorar en su trabajo y entorno social.  En fin, es un gran curso para cualquiera que desee aprender ingls sin profesor, en la comodidad de su casa y a su propio paso.",1130716800,21,698,4.612903225806452
