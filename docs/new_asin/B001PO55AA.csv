3753025,5,B001PO55AA,"Three of the four westerns in this Turner Classic Movie collection are indeed classics. Sam Peckinpah shocked moviegoers and critics with ""The Wild Bunch"" because of the bloody violence. However, the film has stood the test of time for the story and performances of the stars and supporting players alike. It has been a mainstay available over the years in both VHS and DVD. ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" is a classy though oddball western in which cliches are turned upside down and the rambling narrative makes it difficult to tell the good guys from the bad. Warren Beaty is the hero - or is he? ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is still a pure cinematic pleasure to watch no matter how many times you see it. Robert Redford stars as tenderfoot with ambition to become a mountain man. The tough lessons he learns make for a most enjoyable movie. The fourth in the collection, ""The Train Robbers,"" is another in the John Wayne canon made during his later years. Though enjoyable for the action mixed with comedy, it remains in the same class as others made during that era. Hardly classic in a literal sense, but good enough for fans of the Duke - which includes me.",1328918400,15,1147,4.627450980392157

3753029,4,B001PO55AA,"This DVD set is a bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, you get four good-to-excellent movies.  ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" are both classics, and ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and ""The Train Robbers"" are nice additions.  On the other hand, the packaging and presentation are very cheap.  Instead of four discs each containing one movie, there are two double-sided discs that seem to have been haphazardly made.  I had to immediately take back the first copy of this set I bought and exchange it, because one of the discs was badly scratched.

The sad thing is that this could easily be a 5-star set, especially with the inclusion of ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" which is a very underrated film and possibly Robert Altman's best.  I would hope that TCM will pay more attention to the quality of their products in the future.",1252454400,37,828,4.63013698630137
3753030,4,B001PO55AA,"These are not the best westerns in the Warner Home Video stable, but they are interesting films nonetheless.

""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) has Sam Peckinpah directing a stellar cast in one of his best westerns. Some of the supporting cast could have been better developed, but in the end it is a fine example of the genre in acting, story, and action. This film is available in a special 2 disc edition,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Bunch-The-Original-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BT96CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971) is an anti-establishment film typical of the late Vietnam war period that just happens to be set in the old west. There are no heroes to be found, and the outlook is quite cynical. The previous print of this film was released in 2002 and I find the colors to be a bit washed out. Let's hope this is a fresh transfer of this unusual western.

""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972) stars Robert Redford in what is the true story of a mountain man who turns to revenge after his wife and unborn child are killed by Indians. It is more than that, though, as Johnson struggles with survival against the elements prior to all of this tragedy. The latest print of this film was put on DVD in 1997, so the old print is quite VHS-like, for lack of a better term.  Let's hope a better transfer of this film is in this set too.

""The Train Robbers"" (1973) is the only film with John Wayne in it, and it is not one of his best, mainly because the so-called bad guys are just not up to the level you expect of any nemesis of The Duke. You expect John Wayne to have worthy opponents and these guys just don't fit the bill. Wayne does have good chemistry with the other players though and he has some good lines as he escorts a widow to a gold mine her husband left for her. The single DVD of this film was made in 2005 or 2007 and looks quite good, so there is really no need for improvement there.",1240012800,4,2065,4.773109243697479

The main draw for me was  Jeremiah Johnson but  The Wild Bunch is a must have for any serious western collection!  Sam Peckinpah put the reality of violence into "" The Western genre"" giving western fans a unexpected graphic visual of what guns did to the human body!  It is rumored that the special effects department went through buckets of ""blood"" when making  The Wild Bunch & I don't doubt it a bit!!!  The Train Robbers &  McCabe & Mrs. Miller are definitely worth the watch but the two really big movies in this collection are  Jeremiah Johnson &  The Wild Bunch!  ""Jeremiah Johnson "",  much like "" The Revenant""/ "" The Man in the Wilderness"" are based on real Mountain men... a movie genre that is lacking for movies as far as I am concerned.  The Train Robbers is a typical John Wayne western...not his best & not his worst!  McCabe & Mrs. Miller has the potential to be great but is just lacking in something...possibly character development.  You really don't feel that invested in the characters either due to a lack of character development or maybe the actors were just not into it enough I just can't put my finger on it, it has all the ingredients but the end product lacks flavor!  Jeremiah Johnson & The Wild Bunch are worth the price of this collection...actually any one of the two are worth purchasing this collection the rest are icing & movies I am happy to add to my ""Western"" & "" Mountain Man"" Collection's.",1469664000,2,1595,4.520979020979021

3753080,5,B001PO55AA,"I bought this for McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), which is a near perfect piece of filmmaking. I had seen The Wild Bunch (1969) once before and thought it good, but after watching it again and listening to the commentary, I gained even more respect for it and enjoyed it even more. Watching The Wild Bunch and then immediately afterwards watching The Train Robbers (1973), it really hits home how much of a revolution of the Western genre The Wild Bunch really was. While The Train Robbers (1973) comes four years after The Wild Bunch and two years after McCabe & Mrs. Miller, it is really a throwback to an earlier generation of Westerns where none of the well-mannered, overly respectful good guys died and where edifying lessons come through in parts. For me, it was difficult to take The Train Robbers seriously coming as it does in the wake of The Wild Bunch and McCabe & Mrs. Miller, both of which, in their own distinctly different ways, burst the traditional boundaries of the Western. Jeremiah Johnson (1972) was okay, I suppose (though the wolf pack attack scene was just embarrassing). One Amazon reviewer said the packaging was cheap. This is true, but it doesn't bother me because, to me, McCabe & Mrs. Miller alone was worth more than double the $14 I spent on this two-disk, four-film package. Yes, it would have been a little nicer to get McCabe & Mrs. Miller and The Wild Bunch on their own separate discs in better packaging, but I am not complaining. I am delighted with my purchase. Getting these two groundbreaking classics for $14 is a steal.",1453334400,2,1561,4.659420289855072

By buying some of the DVDs with several movies on them, I have already been able to replace all of his John Wayne Collection and then some plus I've been able to find a few of his favorite movies like Jeremiah Johnson on this one.

3753126,5,B001PO55AA,"Director Sydney Pollack's JEREMIAH JOHNSON with Robert Redford is one man's challenge to survive and live in the secluded wilderness. It is almost a forgotten film these days, but made a powerful statement when released in 1972. McCABE AND MRS. MILLER is a demoralizing tale that destroys the sanctity of the America West or is it? Robert Altman attacks one of the pillars of American cinema and the pioneering spirit of America itself with this film. George Roy Hill's BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and Frank Perry's DOC almost accomplished the same end though from different perspectives. Once again Robert Altman's instincts go awry as he further demonstrates that he is no auteur. McCABE AND MRS. MILLER is really not a film director's vision of a historically based society. Just the opposite is true about this film. It is all style and nothing more. There is no vision here. It is even unlike its foreign cousin, the Spaghetti Western. The Spaghetti Western is truer to the ideals of what made the classic American Western what it was. The Spaghetti Westerns were both style and substance and created a vision of the American West from an almost surrealistic netherworld of turmoil, greed and passions but always in the form of homage. If you want to see a film that de-myths the American West try and see James Frawley's KID BLUE with Dennis Hopper, Warren Oates and Ben Johnson. As far as McCABE AND MRS. MILLER is concerned the script and story are both uninteresting and Vilmos Zsigmond's inventive cinematography, though not befitting of the genre, can not take this snoozer out of the doldrums. Warren Beatty as John McCabe once again gives an underplayed performance but it somehow doesn't work in this film as it did for him in films such as SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS and BONNIE AND CLYDE. This is a very thought provoking film. Director Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH released in 1969 is an American epic. In THE WILD BUNCH outlaws portraying heroic deeds and adventures usher out the mythology of the Western as one way of life gives way to another. Unlike Robert Altman's lethargic McCABE AND MRS. MILLER, Sam Peckinpah's film is a homage to men who have lived in this genre and have survived by an anachronistic code of honor that no longer exists entering into the twentieth-century. In the film's finale there is something exciting, energetic, uplifting that makes you want to stand up and cheer these unlikely heroes as they literally go out in a cathartic blaze of glory. As William Holden's Pike Bishop said ""When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal."" Outnumbered at least 50 to 1 they ask for one of there own to be returned to them as they come to terms that their abandonment of Angel broke an unwritten code and it was time to get him back and time for them to end all this in this life. That catharsis is a celebration to what is good and honorable, to something even greater than life itself. Director Burt Kennedy's THE TRAIN ROBBERS as well brings even John Wayne closer to the final days of the Western. One thing I did like about it was that Dominic Frontiere managed to compose a rousing score for this film giving it a feel of John Wayne's earlier days and it is a sentimental send up. The cast is strong and includes Ann-Margret, Rod Taylor, Ben Johnson, Christopher George, Bobby Vinton and Ricardo Montalban. William H. Clothier cinematography adds a lot to this Western giving it just the right feel with beautiful landscapes and vistas. I love the train they have come to rob as its suggested in the title. It is a forgotten ghostly train that is half buried in the desert sand. There is something symbolic in it all.",1421539200,,3712,4.67737003058104

I don't go for much of the train-robber types, but stories about the ""real"" American West and the push into the Northwest are our historical foundation and what made America the land we now know it is. Rightly or wrongly, it's a tale of humankind.

McCabe and Mrs. Miller probably touched me more than any other, as it shows how a town is built ""from the ground up"" based on a few miners prospecting with little more than ""hopes and dreams."" The DVD is terrific because it carries the director's discussion and lots of very interesting background information that I had no idea about. How we came to such a harsh wilderness and built towns and roads and brought some kind of justice into a world ruled by ""might makes right"" is beyond me. True justice, fairness, equality for all are concepts so hard to bring to life, but thank goodness that some of us keep striving for it. McCabe and Mrs. Miller shows just what happens when those concepts are not in ""fair play"" as they were not so much in the Old West as we knew it.

After purchasing this package, may I put to rest the  preceding doubts?  This is a solid series of four movies, very good replications of the originals, and a great buy for the price.  No, you will not get all the extras that each movie packaged alone would have, but then, how often do we actually use (or need) all the extras anyway?  For someone like me, who just wanted to see the movies, this is a bargain and a half.

Being a fan of the western genre, I wanted to primarily see ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", as these two films are consistently ranked in the top 50 westerns of all-time.  I was impressed with ""The Wild Bunch"" (4 of 5 stars), much disappointed with the quirky ""McCabe"" (2 of 5 stars), loved Redford as ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (4 of 5 stars), and thought ""The Train Robbers"" was average John Wayne fair at best.  All things considered, I enjoyed the entertainment value of all four movies, and will likely purchase cased sets like this again.

I never saw the others before so I bought this because they are supposedly classics.  If I were only reviewing ""The Wild Bunch"" I'd only give this two stars, maybe three for the good acting. I really hated it, though.  It had no real story and was very violent. There was not one character anyone could like.  That would be fine if the story was good, but it isn't.  The Train Robbers, on the other hand, had characters that were too good to be true.  The ending could be surprising to some, if you had not already guessed that one of the characters was going to turn out to be not what they supposedly seemed.  I guessed that right away at the beginning.  John Wayne was the usual semi-tough guy hero all the men respect.  McCabe & Mrs. Miller was the old West as it was and I really liked that one. It reminded me in some ways of HBOs Deadwood except it did not have all the cursing Deadwood did. The only thing that spoiled that one for me is it played so dark on my old T.V. I could not even see the actors in some of the scenes. When I get the chance, I'm going to play it on one of my newer slim T.V.'s and see if it looks better.
