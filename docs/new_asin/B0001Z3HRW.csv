8018713,5,B0001Z3HRW,"This is a very cute and sexy OAV series of anime that is fun to watch.

It has some cliche anime scenarios and some very sexy anime ladies.

The plots aren't bad, I personally think that this could have been made in to a full season of a show.",1359763200,2,243,3.938775510204082
8018714,5,B0001Z3HRW,This is very funny and would reccommend it to my friends and family not for kids,1257984000,,80,4.0625
8018715,2,B0001Z3HRW,this series is disappointing. the anime was bad. the sound quality was ok. but this dvd series was not what it is descibed as.,1222214400,,126,4.291666666666667
8018716,3,B0001Z3HRW,"Anime has taken so many twists and turns it,s all art for me. Lusty Ambitions is funny witty and harmless but no way would I let a 5year old watch it. It has a simple story line and it,s good entertainment for those with a sense of humor enjoy.",1219363200,4,244,4.0
8018717,3,B0001Z3HRW,"All's I can say is that it seems to me if you're buying a collection of volumes of a show, it gets old watching every into/exit ESPECIALLY when the original show spends a quarter of it EXPLAINING THE LAST SHOW!!

Maybe die hard Simpsons fans may want to know how the family's going to sit on the couch next, but I find it overkill and distracting.

Not as creative as I hoped either, but not 'BAD'.",1200700800,2,398,4.223684210526316
8018718,5,B0001Z3HRW,"I just bought this DVD and I love it! Quick, to the point story-line. see the first part in english and then with subtitles some of the  wording is differant when translated properly.",1128211200,3,183,4.545454545454546
8018719,5,B0001Z3HRW,"If you ever wondered how and why Mouse ended up with three lovely ladies as his devoted servants, then this disc is for you! This disc packs all the eye candy and humor of the first volume, but combines it with a more serious tone and the backstory of Mae and Yayoi. Plus, more sex! Who could ask for anything more? My rating: 10/10.",1119312000,20,333,4.21875
8018720,4,B0001Z3HRW,"The Mouse-Vol 2, picks up right where Volume 1 left off.  The Mouse (and his crew of three curvy female attendants) is intent on stealing the next prized treasure with the cops bent on stopping him and all the while, still maintaining his double identity of a nerdy school  teacher.  It also reveals another character, Woof (who also has a couple of curvy assistants of his own), who is intent on ending Mouse's life.  They all come colliding in the end but will The Mouse be able to come out on top?
Volume 2 is pretty much like volume 1 in that there's still some of the same zaniness as the first.  The Mouse is still a little too wishy-washy to be in command of such beauties, reminds me of Larry Hagman in the 'I Dream of Genie' TV series.  Woof brings a little more seriousness to the series but it's a welcome turn.  The fanservice is definitely back (and with a vengeance) but if you saw the first DVD, this isn't anything new (except for the very end).
All in all, if you liked the first DVD, then you'll definitely like this one.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and just tries to have fun.",1087257600,25,1105,4.330097087378641
