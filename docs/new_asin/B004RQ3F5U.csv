8439178,5,B004RQ3F5U,"It is so refreshing to hear the great hymns of the past set to tasteful and original settings for our current generation. What many forget is that when originally written the hymns were contemporary to their time.  Not only are the hymns beautiful to hear and sing along to, they are hymns with lyrical content that drip with the tender mercies and grace of God.  In an age when praise music's lyrics emphasize the unrealistic perfections of the worshippers adoration and love, these hymns emphasize the perfections of  Divine love and grace over above the weakness and frailties of wandering saints heart.  Oh that more churches would recover honest, God glorifying worship like Indelible Grace has.",1337731200,4,700,5.008620689655173
