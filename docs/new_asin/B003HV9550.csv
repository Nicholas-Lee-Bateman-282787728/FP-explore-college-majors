8397225,5,B003HV9550,"Decades ago, when aerobics first became popular, it was like dancing - you learned routines to contemporary songs and for someone like me who loves to dance, it was wonderful. Then step aerobics became popular, lord knows why, and the music used was monotonous and aerobics was no longer fun.
'Muve"" takes you back to the joy of exercising to music. You make it as low-key or energetic as you want but what you get is a marvelous combination of dance, tai chi, and aerobics. The music is all Hawaiian/Pacific pop, which wouldn't have been my first choice if asked, but it's actually perfect to exercise to.
All pluses: instructions, basic moves, and practice videos are included on each DVD; the ""Muse"" (class leader Maggie) doesn't talk during the routines; the class participants have various levels of skill and ability - (they're real people in other words); and some of the routines incorporate chairs so anyone of any age or physical level can 'muve'.",1401321600,,957,4.841463414634147
8397226,4,B003HV9550,"As a busy happy daycare momma, I needed to plan gross motor skills for a new group of friends joining us (age 12mo, 19mo, and 24mo) This is a big hit offering interesting, engaging, and age appropriate music and motion materials (that don't drive me nuts with dreadful noise.)  While other materials I have are geared specifically toward toddlers  by far this dvd is the absolute most engaging even for the smallest.  A bit like how an aquarium can draw you in, so does the music and weird but gentle activity of this dvd, and not just for wee ones but the older children returning from a busy school day also ask for this indoor activity to help spend big energy in a safe and soothing way.  Everyone stands on their rug and moves.  Sorta like little zombies the upbeat Hawaiian themed music makes them sway away.  As far as being an alternate form of movement for grown ups  I gotta say if you followed along you could surely break a sweat if you wished and feel happy after moving.  Yes - it looks a bit goofy, but only until you start swaying too!",1386720000,3,1051,4.381443298969073
8397227,5,B003HV9550,"Those who've complained about other videos with chatter, annoying instructors not enough improvisation  or complicated  steps may have found their ideal DVD in this one!
All the instruction is by visual prompt and music alone. There are four basic steps that may be combined into an infinite number of improvised combinations.
The dance leader, the Muse,  demonstrates suggested moves, but dancers follow loosely, or just make up their own moves.
Full instruction and advice is given on the menu, to insure that everyone stays safe and has fun.
Dancers in the video dance in a plain studio with a white backdrop. The beautiful animated icons add visual appeal, though.
Dancers are all shapes and ages, so love the body you're  in. Everyone from children to grandparents
 can enjoy these routines together, as the title says.
Choose from a short and sweet routine of 8-10 minutes (6) a Party time workout of 18-20 minutes (4)  or a full workout of 39-60 minutes (3) at any energy level.  Some  use chairs or scarves as props.
MUVE is based in Hawaii, so the music is fun, Hawaiian  music, performed by various artists. The full track list gives titles and artists, and any one may be clicked on a la carte. Or, play the entire list from the top.
MUVE is a dream come true, a dance workout that is easy, flexible and fun for all ages. Dance like nobody's looking!",1367366400,5,1361,4.708860759493671
