8758119,3,B01E9J2XRA,"The setting Is the small California town of Golden Torch (looks a lot like  San Jacinto). The Mayor (Sharon Fredrickson) is popular with everyone in town except for Sheriff Kelly Jarvis (Danny Hansen, Amazon film reviewer), the new guy in town. The first 10 minutes of the film introduces the characters and sets the scene before the first crazed outbreaks occurs as the town's people attack and kill with one claiming there is ""something in his head"" which apparently doesn't market as well as ""On the Brain.""

The film does give an early clue as to the cause and is similar to real incurable disease. The film ends rather abruptly. The acting and script left something to be desired as exampled in the discussion scene  between Amy Waller and Shenik Taylor. With only 12 days to shoot, no time for retakes. Looks like they had only one cloudy eye contact that everyone shared.

I would have done the end differently with a big grand finale head explosion with blood splattered everywhere.

Guide: F-word, brief sex/rape. No nudity 2 1/2 stars I preferred ""Impulse"" (1984).",1469059200,3,1074,4.815217391304348
