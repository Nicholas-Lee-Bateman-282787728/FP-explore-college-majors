1055399,5,6305573832,"When I saw ""Born Losers"" for the first time around 1970, I had a  peculiar feeling that this story was not over---and I hungered for more!  Then, of course, came ""Billy Jack"" and a legend was born.  ""Born Losers"" set box office records for the genre at that time.  It's just one of those movies that carries a quiet but mighty message: The  good guy wins!  On the surface, it may appear to be a simple bikers and  chicks flick, but it was so much more.  It carried a message of  justice....... and how someone who just wants to mind his own business  sometimes gets caught up in the fight for justice.  I admit... Jane  Russell's acting is not Oscar material, but the movie was a star vehicle  for Robert Tessier, who later appeared in ""The Deep"", ""The  Longest Yard"", ""Hard Times"" and a host of other movies and  TV shows.  Jeremy Slate also does an excellent job as the leader of the  Biker gang too.  Born Losers is a must for Billy Jack fans because it was,  in most cases, unknown to fans as the precurser to the legendary film and  Tom Laughlin masterpiece.  And believe me.... there are still tons of Billy  Jack fans out there.  Check out the web site too.... it's worth it for  fans.",959558400,8,1192,4.337899543378995
1055400,5,6305573832,"This is a superb movie! The first of the Billy Jack saga, this tells us what he did right after he got back from Viet Nam. We see the societal attitudes that prompted him to leave civilization and seek spiritual truth  in the next movie.  The acting and direction are wonderful, and there is a  VERY interesting character played by Jane Russell. A type of part that she  never did anywhere else!",954547200,7,395,4.444444444444445
1055401,5,6305573832,"After ""The Wild One"", this might be one of the masterpieces of motorcycle-gangs films. A well elaborated production and, above all, a remarkable work of the Director. A must see by all means.",950745600,6,191,4.818181818181818
1055402,3,6305573832,"Born Losers, a cheesy outlaw biker flick from the 70s, complete with a small town, two-wheeled outlaws and pathetic, terrified citizens more interested in their own personal safety than the fabric of their society.  The outlaws predictably run roughshod over the police and judicial system,  creating mayhem and brutally silencing witnesses. This outstanding Billy  Jack movie nevertheless timelessly encapsulates what's continuously wrong  with our society. A gutless lack of will when it comes to creating and  enforcing laws for the good of the community instead of the individual.  Even lions will back off if a 300 strong herd of antelope decide as a group  they don't care to be eaten, ALL turn around and stomp the lions. The lions  will leave and eat grass before trying that again, or die. Pain is a great  teacher for some. Tragically, we are EXACTLY LIKE the bunch of antelope  that move away when one of their bretheren are attacked by lions and  devoured, hoping they won't be next. Murderers like Stalin, Hitler and  Saddam counted on it. The hero in the film, McLaughlin, who is portrayed as  a military veteran with a warrior instinct, singlehandedly stands up to the  outlaws with what they understand best, not a lot of hand-holding and anger  counseling, but total destruction, bringing their reign to an end. Born  Losers is just a movie, but what it portrays happens everyday, and we just  let it. We must like it that way.",947203200,11,1444,4.900826446280992

1055488,5,6305573832,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***  One person's trash is another's treasure, as they say.  Some movies are bad and painful to watch.  This one is so bad it makes Edward D. Wood Jr. seem like Cecil B. DeMille by comparison, but it gets three cheers from me, a JOY to watch (why I'm not quite sure), great, priceless.  In the POOREST of taste, with some of the worst possible acting, dialogue, music, etc.- including Jane Russell, the mother of a rape victim, who wears tight, lowcut gold lame gowns and jewels (during the day), and seems to have forgotten every acting lesson she ever had.  The script is stupefying, as if written by a bunch of none-too-bright 13 year olds, how they THOUGHT bikers, cops and abused teens would speak and behave, the worst lines EVER, pushing your ""outrage"" buttons and priming you to revel in the orgy of retribution that Billy unleashes on the bad guys.  The police are totally inept- thank goodness for intelligent, sensitive, spiritual, altruistic, hunky, KICKASS Billy Jack.  I can think of few other films that are simultaneously schmaltzy, well-meaning and yet utterly crass.

I am a big fan of Tom Laughlin, don't get me wrong- I thought the sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Jack/dp/B000X73NBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Jack</a>, was actually a pretty good film (though evincing many of the same flaws as this one).  I saw Billy Jack at the drive-in and thousands of people extended their fists out of all their car windows on the way out of the drive-in, in complete silence, in tribute to Billy!  It was an incredible moment, actually, but I guess you had to be there.  Laughlin's directing improved dramatically (pun intended) between the two films.

That said, I think the very wide disparity in opinions (ranging from people loving it, taking it seriously and thinking it a GOOD film, to others saying it's beneath contempt and simply awful) has to do with one's focus (and sensibilities, duh).  Laughlin's acting, persona, and martial arts skills are inspired, IMO (maybe akin to William Shatner's brand of stardom- simultaneously campy and marvelous). Nearly everyone else is TERRIBLE.  The film is shamelessly prurient- grind-house fodder, with closeups of teen girls' crotches, nipples and bums, for example.  One rape victim tells her parents and the police defiantly that she ENJOYED being gang-raped and beaten, gulp- CRINGE-worthy (for adults only).  Another factor in people's assessment of it may be WHEN they saw it- at the time it broke all rules, recognized no boundaries, was a revelation for many, marrying different genres and offering a war veteran-turned pacifist also adept at martial arts (an anti-hero).  It broke a LOT of new ground, one of the first ""counter-culture"" films.  It seems almost a parody- but of what?  It was, I believe, the FIRST of its kind, and served as a model for many films to come.

I love it for these reasons but also because I revel in REALLY bad movies, and this one has the added bonus of wonderful Tom Laughlin breaking up the dross with his potent charisma and personhood, plus, he eventually metes out justice and rights all wrongs (at considerable personal cost to himself).  And, it affords a distinctive and uniquely valid window into the schisms of the 1960s.  There's nothing else remotely like it (except&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-sequel/dp/B000X73NBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the sequel</a>, of course).  If you don't mind shamelessly gratuitous sex and violence, in service to an utterly original slice of 60s American pie, and, you've been known to say: ""I can't BELIEVE how BAD this is!"" with GLEE, don't miss it!",1412899200,4,3729,5.272419627749577
1055528,5,6305573832,"To me Billy Jack will always be the original 'Born Losers'. The line ""I'm gonna count to three."" Don't want to give it away but that still is one of the best lines and action that follows of all time in any movie. Tom Laughlin was a genius, without him we'd not have the movies we now have. He was the first to open a movie nation wide on the same day. He gambled everything he owned on making this movie, putting his house and everything on the table to tell the story of a Half-Breed Indian. He inspired me to do the same put everything on the table to make the movie ""Shadow Hawk On Sacred Ground."" Thanks Tom for all your inspiration and your guts to take it to everyone in Hollywood and show them You Could Do It Your Way."" RIP Tom Laughin.",1411344000,2,745,4.109589041095891

It's not a Native American liberation movie like the rest of the Billy Jack movies, This is not Easy Rider but it isn't Zombie Psycho-Babes On Choppers either. It's sort of a quirky cult classic.

1055596,5,6305573832,"This was the start of the Billy Jack Legacy as this movie hit the theaters on August 18 1967 starring Tom Laughlin as Billy Jack, Elizabeth James as Vicky Barrington, and Jeremy Slate as Daniel Carmody. A motorcycle gang led by Daniel Danny Carmody rides through the local towns terrorizing the people and the local law is afraid of them. Enters Vicky Barrington who races to the airport to pick up her dad only to find out that she was rejected again. While the gang is riding the come across a young kid who they beat up and Billy Jack comes to his rescue. Billy is arrested along with the bikers and thrown in jail. The gang ends up raping four women who they have threaten the women into not testifying. Vicki who was raped goes under the protection of Billy Jack who has also had several altercations with the gang. The gang escalates their pressure on both Vicki and Billy Jack to keep her out of the courtroom. Some facts you may not know. This picture was banned from Sweden because of its high violence rating in 1968, 1972, and 1975. When Billy Jack and Vicky go into eat at a local restaurant they are met by an astrologer. The astrologer asks Billy when his birthday is, Billy told him August 10, and that is the real birthday of Tom Laughlin. Thoughts on the movie! I thought it was a great movie that kept my interest all the way through. You can see way Tom Laughlin did all four Billy jack pictures because he was excellent in his role as Billy Jack. Elizabeth James was excellent in her role as Vicky Barrington. She was gorgeous riding around in that white bikini on her bike. Because of Vicky and the action in this movie I give this picture 10 weasel stars.",1390089600,4,1677,4.395498392282958

Now that he has passed(may Tom Laughlin RIP) I was going to watch his movie that I was planning to watch in my Instant Que on NF. When I read an article about two other Billy Jack movies I never knew existed, Born Losers and BJ goes to Washington I started searching for them and found them here on Amazon. I like watching movies and there sequels in the order they were made or are suppose to be. Anyways, when I found out this movie had to do about BillyJack fighting lawless biker dudes who wear swastikas and acting loony(and at times bisexual) I was immediately intrigued. The movie storyline and the kung fu action was evened out pretty good throughout the film. A few gripes I had was maybe they could have used a little better kind of film and some of the acting and stupid decision making by the girls,and the police being cowarrds.

I'm trying to remember one of Billy's lines to one of the town cops who wouldn't ""man up"" and help out. It was along the lines of "" If your women are raped and beaten YOU deserve it""  Lots of raping and beating going on. Teenage girls gang raped and mentally disturbed as a result, being screamed at to testify in court against their attackers. The cops telling these young girls that they will be protected and then letting them be taken to be brutalized yet again?!  Can't really recommend this movie,as a woman and the mother of a daughter.

Running Time on this is 113m.
Good stereo separation on the commentary but also very loud!
The commentary with Tom and Delores were Outta-Sync with what they were discussing.
In the movie those 4 chicks were just asking for trouble and they found it with the bikers,guess they were curious.
What a dumb idot,the guy in the volkswagon mouthing off to a bunch of bikers that were,and did kick his ass they wouldn't let up once they got him.
Make him pay!
He made the mistake of not keeping his eyes to himself when pulling up next to them.
The 1 chick on the back of Child's bike,who is a really cool dude,ruthless looking,enticed him by using a mouth gesture but he was staring before that.
Bad move on his part and after he accidently hit the Pres bike his mouth got him in trouble,the Pres was gonna let it go.
I think the part that got me was hearing his two front teeth break.
That Gangrene was a woman hitter with his fist yet and Speechless was something else too along with Crabs.
Two male bikers kissing was a turn off for me Yuck,but to each his own.
Liked Jack Starrett,that was a good role for him.
When you run up against that many bikers it's best to keep your eyes forward and your mouth shut and pray and hope they don't start something with you or anyone else for that matter.
I would recommend this movie,in spite of everything i enjoyed it.",1347321600,3,1454,4.329670329670329
1055700,4,6305573832,"Oh boy, are there a lot of things wrong with The Born Losers.  It would probably take less time to talk about what's right rather than list all the flaws in this flick, but I have to say that this is one of the best biker flicks out there, hands down.  Maybe not THE best, but definitely up there in the top ten.  A lot of hay is made about this movie being the first that Billy Jack appears in, but I think that's looking at the film the wrong way.  Yes, we see a sameness of theme used by Laughlin to get his points across, and the character himself remains essentially the same, but in truth, the commentary that the Billy Jack films were trying to accomplish is absent here.  This is an exploitation flick in the truest sense of the word - Laughlin and Delores Taylor wanted to exploit current events and current trends to get enough cash to make the film they really wanted to make in the first place, which no one at that time was interested in supporting.

That's no bad thing - Orson Welles did the same thing for most of his career.  But back to The Born Losers; I remember watching this several years ago, and hating it.  Everything about it seemed like a turnoff - the acting, the violence, the rape scenes, the script, the ridiculously un-subtle way Laughlin drove his themes home to the audience.  I would have been hard pressed to find anything about it that I liked.  And now, watching it all these years later, I still see all the same things I saw then.  I guess the only real thing that's changed is my appreciation for low-budget filmmaking.  So that is the first point to consider about The Born Losers - if you do not as a rule enjoy low budget filmmaking (especially from the late 60's or 70's), then ignore any hype you may hear about this flick and keep going.  You're probably going to want to skip the sequels as well.

The second thing is that this is a biker flick, pure and simple.  Those tuning in because they enjoyed the Billy Jack film and eager for more are likely going to be disappointed.  Because Laughlin is who he is, there are still elements in The Born Losers of the social commentary he would expand in later films, but that is not its primary focus.  Instead, it follows the general formula of a lot of biker films - a ruthless gang terrorizes a coastal town/young pretty girls and everyone is too scared to stand up to them.  In this case, the film is loosely based on actual events, where a group of Hell's Angels raped several young girls and then intimidated the girls and their parents into not testifying.  The character of Billy Jack runs afoul of the gang, and eventually must stand them down without help from the authorities.

For all its late 60's silliness, The Born Losers still has some very gritty moments, moments that are sometimes surprising in their effectiveness.  There's a degree of violence here that is only hinted at by a lot of other biker flicks - and in its non-PC way it's almost jaw-dropping in that you just could not get away with it in today's films.  And that, I think, is part of its attractiveness still today.  Not the violence per se, but the fact that a film like this is capable of surprising me with its possibilities.  Things that are taboo now were almost cliche then, so when something comes out of left field, I'm startled and a little shocked.

That ain't going to cut much ice if you are easily offended, or prefer your films startle you in predictable, safe ways.  Movies from the late 60's and early 70's have, in general, a pretty strange sensibility about them - they take a special sort of filter to enjoy in the first place, and if you don't have that filter in place, they will more than likely appear plainly ridiculous. But if you already know that you have an affinity for films from this time - especially the low-budget ones - then The Born Losers should also appeal.  Laughlin himself has an idiosyncratic screen presence that I thought was actually pretty cool - and although he's a tough customer in the film, he isn't outlandishly invincible as a lot of modern tough guys seem to be.  Jeremy Slate, as the gang leader Danny is more human than most of these type of characters, which adds depth to a very thin script, and the young, perky Elizabeth James is attractive and spunky.  This film also marks the film debut of strong man Robert Tessier, a veteran of b-movies and exploitation throughout the 70's, and who was given the role because he was an actual member of a local outlaw motorcycle gang.

More enjoyable than I would have thought, The Born Losers is definitely worth a look for all exploitation fans.

There is a question about the length of this film - the runtime on this version is listed at 113 minutes, which is also what IMDb lists, and is what the 35th anniversary collection version is too.  I can't say that the film isn't cut, but I think that as long as the version you buy has 113 minutes listed on it, then you are getting all of The Born Losers you can get.",1343865600,,4990,4.419672131147541
1055701,1,6305573832,"The Born Losers, 1967 film

One reason to watch this movie is its being a forerunner to the very successful ""Billy Jack"" movie of 1972. A better writer and story made a difference. You will best understand this movie as a morality play between the conflict of good and evil. That biker gang represents organized crime that threatens the public. The authorities are presented as ineffective (when they can call upon support from the state and Federal government). The loss of Billy Jack's job as a horse breaker symbolizes the economic changes that destroyed many small businesses in the 1960s. There is no mention of the big landowners who profit from a resort town that attracts tourists. Part of the appeal is the drugs sold by the biker gang. Society is in danger when they can't unite for their defense. California pioneered the ""Committees of Vigilance"" in the mid-19th century that protected towns from criminals.

The movie starts with a walking man carrying a slung Garand on his shoulder. The sea shore says California. Billy Jack goes into town to buy propane for his trailer. A driver in a car bumps a motorcycle and doesn't apologize. ""Help me!"" The people in town don't want trouble. The bikers threaten Billy Jack, who defends himself against this mob by firing his rifle. He is arrested and fined $1,000. The bikers are fined $150. Vicky Barrington is disappointed when her father fails to meet her. [Negligent parents?] Motorcycles are driven down main street. Young girls dressed in bathing suits watch them and gossip. A father disciplines his son in public. The bikers put a sign on Billy Jack's jeep. ""Be gone."" A Deputy Sheriff enters a bar and sees a reel tape player [high-tech then]. Vicky swims in the ocean. Later she is followed as she rides her motorcycle on the highway. What can she or the police do? [Stop being an exhibitionist?]

Billy Jack needs money and asks for a bank loan. Vicky visits the gang's large house. [Where is her judgment?] Two girls scream as they are carried away. Vicky offers them drugs as a distraction to escape. But her fuel line was turned off and she runs out of gas. She runs away until she is caught. ""Big Rock"" is threatened by students and a motorcycle gang who come to this resort town. The townspeople are afraid of reprisals. [Who runs their town?] A young woman is home alone at night. She finds uninvited guests in her home! They threaten her if she testifies against them. Her mother gets emotional. ""Get out!"" Vicky recovers in the hospital. The D.A. asks for her help. The Deputy's car is stolen as a diversion. Billy Jack stops the bikers who went after Vicky. That gang robs Billy Jack's trailer so he goes into town and asks for his missing $600. The next day they meet him at a gas station to talk and fight.

Shots are fired as a diversion while the gang abducts Louann. Her father goes to their house and is caught. The gang attacks Billy Jack. Vicky bargains for him. Elsewhere Linda speaks out! [A speech to shock the viewers.] Billy Jack will go to that gang's house, alone if necessary. He takes his bolt-action rifle. ""He means it!"" The gang gets a new leader. The police arrive to arrest the gang. Will the wrong man be shot? [For irony.] Vicky goes to see Billy Jack as he gets medical care. The sun sets in the west, tomorrow is another day. There is an implied ending to this story.

Has the problem of tourists and transients in a resort town been solved? No, tourists and transients bring money and trouble to most resort towns. Can you have one without the other?",1343260800,,3552,4.622820919175911

I looked around for a version that I thought was not cut and was a little disappointed when I watched this version. It is still a good movie but if you had seen the uncut version you will notice that some scenes are missing. If the uncut version is for sale down the road I wiil definately buy that copy.

1055756,5,6305573832,"I'd be willing to bet, If you were to ask any Tom Laughlin fan what their favorite film was they'd probably say ""Billy Jack"" but for me it's always been ""Born Losers"". This is a movie about a gang of Hell's Angels running rampant in a small California town. The town's people live in complete fear of the bikers and even though the police have guns they seem afraid to step in or confront the Bikers. Tom Laughlin who plays Billy Jack is absolutely great in the role he created.

On the outside, Billy Jack seems like an easy going guy as he goes about minding his own business. Unfortunately for him, he just can't stand by and watch someone being victimized. It seems that the motorcycle gang has set their sights on a young woman and Billy Jack comes to her aid. Now this is the point when the tension between the gang and Billy Jack begins to boil over and everything starts to explode as Billy Jack takes on the biker gang by himself. Born Losers definitely has the goods and continues to deliver them right up until the end. This movie was not a big Hollywood blockbuster, It was a low budget independent film and the most successful of it's time.

Billy Jack fans do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of ""Born Losers"" today, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. This was the first film that the character of Billy Jack appeared in and after seeing him you won't forget him. This movie has violence and some nudity, so it's definitely not for the whole family. This is my favorite Billy Jack film and I'm glad to finally have it on DVD.

Image Entertainment states that a new spectacular high-definition digital transfer for unsurpassed quality was used for this DVD release. The picture is pretty decent for the most part and better than any previous DVD version I've seen, but it still contains some noticeable scratches and debris here and there. The sound is in 5.1 Digital Dolby this time around and it sounds clear and crisp on my sound system. The film is presented in its 1.85:1 aspect ratio and enhanced for 16:9 TV's. There are two Audio Commentaries with the makers of the film included as extras. The legend begins with Billy Jack!

Because you failed to show up for the NCAA Championship Game, thereby making it as boring as watching grass grow, I went channel surfing and stumbled across BORN LOSERS.  I now have a new entry on my list of Worst Movies of All Time.  And what I admire the most is this flick's consistency:  It's just plain consistently bad:  Acting, writing, directing, cinematography, music, editing, etc., etc.

A gang of moronic, nasty bikers is successfully terrorizing a sleepy California town.  In the process, they assault teenage girls--girls who are too intimidated to testify against them and put them in jail.  So the bikers ride, and drink, and carouse, and stir up more trouble; yet the payoff is the culmination of each biker scene, when we are treated to the gang's leader making a suggestion (""Let's go to town!""), followed by a closeup of each biker yelling his vociferous approval--or a closeup of the back tire of each motorcyle as it spins and spits out California sand.

Can't remember when I've ever laughed so hard.

Naturally, with such a hopeless situation, one man will stand alone to combat such evil--a former Green Beret named Billy Jack (yep, the one and only Tom Laughlin), who just wants to rodeo and play his victim card for being a Native American.  Billy Jack karate chops the bad guys--in between playing his guitar (well, pretending to play it) and waxing pseudo philosophical--in one overly-pretentious scene after another, until the showdown at the gang's compound.  Which is exactly when the viewer throws up his/her hands and proclaims:  ""Please!  I can't take it anymore!""

This was the Billy Jack introduction that launched Laughlin's awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Jack/dp/B00004XPOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Jack</a>&nbsp;franchise, and I can't think of an intro more deserving.  Watch for a cameo by Jane Russell, certainly indicative of the depths of her career at the time.  Folks, if you're looking for bad, this is it.  BORN LOSERS is really, really, really bad.  Rolling on the floor bad.  Two stars for the entertainment value.

1055760,5,6305573832,"Ok, ok, so it's violent, often distasteful, and the acting often pretty bad. However, Born Losers is a greatly entertaining macho biker film from the swaggering sixties' Summer of Love. If you want to watch ""Citizen Kane""---go elsewhere. If you want ""Superbad"" or ""Knocked Up"" fun and games---get lost. If you want meaning, wisdom and enlightenment in a movie---take a hike. If you've had a long week at the office, the old lady is stressing you out, the kids are going nuts and the bills are piling up, just sit back and obtain some major catharsis. Jane Russell appears in a cheezy, annoying but well-done role. Jack Starrett, who was awesome in FIRST BLOOD [1982] as the sadistic deputy, is in this as a ""nice"" cop but NEVER steal his patrol car! Elizabeth James was simply beautiful & angelic and a pleasure to look at in this film but her choppy, monotone acting probably doomed her career while her brutalization in the film may turn some viewers off. The ""count-to-three"" standoff scene between hero Billy Jack and villian Jeremy Slate is a classic, never-to-be-forgotten clip. Again, this receives my highest rating for pure unpretentious entertainment and butt-kickin release value.

Enters Vicky Barrington who races to the airport to pick up her dad only to find out that she was rejected again. While the gang is riding the come across a young kid who they beat up and Billy Jack comes to his rescue. Billy is arrested along with the bikers and thrown in jail. The gang ends up raping four women who they have threaten the women into not testifying. Vicki who was raped goes under the protection of Billy Jack who has also had several altercations with the gang. The gang escalates their pressure on both Vicki and Billy Jack to keep her out of the courtroom. Some facts you may not know.

The astrologer asks Billy when his birthday is, Billy told him August 10, and that is the real birthday of Tom Laughlin. Thoughts on the movie! I thought it was a great movie that kept my interest all the way through. You can see way Tom Laughlin did all four Billy jack pictures because he was excellent in his role as Billy Jack. Elizabeth James was excellent in her role as Vicky Barrington. She was gorgeous riding around in that white bikini on her bike.

1055762,4,6305573832,"This was the movie that started the Billy Jack franchise of the early 70s and it is definitely a product of that era in everything from costume to style to dialog to location.

Tom Laughlin plays Billy Jack, a mysterious loner who is part Indian and recently released from the Special Forces in Vietnam. He is trying to get along in southern California but is handicapped with such traits as a conscience. He gets arrested on ""vigilante"" charges when he saves a young boy from being beaten to death by a biker gang. This puts him off of the good citizenship ideal.

This same motorcycle gang mentioned before has more to its activities than just beating kids bloody. It also like such recreational pastimes as rape. When a group of girls is hospitalized after a particularly brutal rape, the DA desperately wants at least one of them to press charges but all of the girls are frightened of retaliation. The gang victimizes each one further to ensure their silence.

On of the girls is spunkier than the rest. She decides to prosecute and the gang comes after her. She runs straight into Billy Jack's arms and Billy Jack stiffens her resolve and helps to protect her when the local sheriff proves unable to do so.

The action in this movie is understated by today's standards and the fights are really laughable. They do make their points, though and the point of the movie is not action but justice.",1186790400,3,1399,4.629032258064516

It's the most entertaining of the ""biker movie"" genre, because it has a story and vivid characters. Elizabeth James is Vicky Barrington, a vacationing college student who comes up against a nasty motorcycle gang in a California mountain town. Naturally, the gang, headed by a weathered Jeremy Slate, take off after Vicky (who is on a motorcycle wearing white boots and a matching bikini) and two of them eventually catch and rape her. She's not the only victim. Three incredibly foolish local girls visit the gang's ""clubhouse"" and meet a similar fate. But they don't have a champion like Tom Laughlin (in his first appearance as Billy Jack) who manages to get Vicky out of danger (at least for a while) and subsequently falls in love with her. ""Born Losers"" has a great score by ""Wild Angels"" composer (and future Lieutenant Governor of California) Mike Curb, good acting by a large cast, and a fine cameo appearance by Jane Russell as the trashy mother of one of the victimized girls.

This character defined the word ""Antihero"" in the classic 1967 independent film "" The Born Losers. Made on a shoestring for under $150,000 by director Tom Laughlin, the movie went on to become one of the highest grossing independent films of all time until Star Wars came out 10 years later.

Tom Laughlin is Billy Jack, an Ex-Green beret who plays by his own rules. Returning to the states after a tour of duty, all he wants to do is get back to a normal life in the California seaside town he's been staying in. A man of peace, this Half Native American trained in the martial arts will fight if he has to. And he will when trouble comes to town. A group of bikers known as the ""Born losers"" have come into town and are terrorizing the local people. Raping several college girls, the losers have the town in their grip. The sheriff won't arrest them and the DA won't prosecute them without testimony from the girls. All of the women are scared to testify except for Vicky (Elizabeth James) who won't give into the biker's threats and intimidation. Billy Jack protects her from the losers and in doing so kicks al lot of butt.

I caught Born Losers one late night on the late movie and since then I've seen it three times each time it got better. It's in my top ten favorite movies. Okay, the acting isn't Oscar worthy and the production values are kind of sparse. (It's a 1967 low budget film so I won't nitpick)  But the story is so engrossing (it doesn't hurt that Elizabeth James looked SUPER hot in that bikini and biker boots riding down the coast) and the action shots so cool you can't help but hope Billy Jack beats the crap out of those losers.

Unfortunately, one cannot dismiss ""Born Losers"" (or any of the other Billy Jack series flicks) as pure camp.

Be sure to buy this  movie. It is one of the best.,959904000,6,551,4.310679611650485
7892501,3,6305573832,"I saw the movie ""Billy Jack"" when it originally released and especially enjoyed the fight scenes. The movie itself was solid as well with a charming independent feel and overall positive message. Now many decades later I finally got around to seeking out its predecessor - ""Born Losers"". It was described as a gritty biker-gang-terrorizes-community typical drive-in movie fare of the time. There wasn't much mention of martial-arts scenes, but surely they would be there. Tom Laughlin was more than capable of delivering them. But he didn't. This movie is everything one would hope for in a low-budget but well made good guy prevails in the end film. Only one thing would have made it more complete and that would have been more, or really ANY, good fight scenes. Still it's worth a watch for the late-'60s flashback.",1517097600,,817,4.927536231884058

7892503,4,6305573832,"Not really sure why, but I like Born Losers. I saw it when it first came out, and liked it then. Maybe it's the story of someone standing up to the toughies who terrorize the locals, I don't know. A quiet, self confident fellow who takes all he can before finally standing up and handling the situation when the locals can't/won't.",1488585600,3,331,4.442622950819672
