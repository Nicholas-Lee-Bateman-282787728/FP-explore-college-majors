You must watch this movie if you love girls, love life and respect human life equality / justice.

Very well written, documentaed and directed - I saw this movie on TV when on a business trip at Gothenburg, Sweden.

This movie is so powerful that it will leave a permanent impact in your mind and it will force you to do something e.g. you may stop buying any products, services or event which directly or indirectly exploit girls.

This is so true story and so sad brutal human exploitation and tragedy in twenty first century",1200268800,,545,4.530612244897959
8119159,5,B000F8UABG,"I saw the movie when it was first aired on Lifetime.  I am a student who actively researches this issue of human trafficking and the sex slave trade and have done numerous studies and reports on it.  From my understanding, I have found this film very accurate, and thus, very disturbing.  It is extremely educational and factual, despite its 'fictional' plot.  I recommend to anyone and everyone.",1145318400,12,396,4.865671641791045
