1841074,5,B00008EY7D,"A unique coming of age story. Grandma's personality is caring and sometimes overbearing. Victor is trying to find his way as all young males who transition from boyhood to manhood. Victor and his siblings are finding their way without mom and dad. Grandma is both ""mom and dad"" as Victor states to the intake worker. Excellent story and a very talented cast.",1492905600,,358,4.790322580645161
1841075,5,B00008EY7D,"A super sweet film. Great perspective to lower middle class immigrant family of kids trying to be kids and grandma trying to be grandma.  A film that demonstrates misunderstandings and generation gaps, but everyone means well and everyone loves everyone, but they all express their love in different ways, and some are very shy to show it.  Super cute bunch of young people.  They were all cute in their own ways from their emotional expressions to the personalities of how they spoke to each other.

A family from Dominican Republic, two boys, one girl, and a grandma who took care of them.  Summer in New York City.  Kids play at the city pool, wants to find love, yet they all live in a neighborhood that is hard/difficult as there are many not so nice people around them.  With that, people tend to be defensive and with attitudes, yet everyone has his or her own reasons as to why they react in there own ways.  No matter how they all struggle with each other just like any other family and friends, they ultimately care about each other enough to take a breather and admit that everything is going to be okay.  Love the beginning, the middle and the end.  All the actors were great and very authentic in their portrayal of a Latino family in New York City. Grandma was cute and just a wonderful person.  Just a great cute loving film.",1492214400,,1340,4.518672199170124

The spotlight is on her struggles to raise these three teenage children, while yearning to maintain some semblance of a normal life. She cares deeply, and want to instill good values. The teenage children have a totally different agenda. There is a compliant youngest, an indifferent middle child and an adventurous eldest. They live in the ""projects"", an ecosystem leaving many things desired. Very realistic setting, every actor has played their part exceedingly well. America is a melting pot some say. Let truth be told. This movie is slice out of that real American life of a different social class of immigrants that one would never encounter unless one is directly part of this community.  It is educational as it is entertaining. The total lack of support from the system for a guardian and her helplessness and struggles to raise these children are documented very well.

1841250,5,B00008EY7D,"I could not give a more solid 5.  Written and directed by Peter Sollett, this disarmingly honest and beautiful film engenders just the right amount of natural humor. A step ladder of adolescents, Victor ( Victor Rasuk) at 16 the oldest, is being raised by a rigidly puritanical  though loving (barely visible, but her anger is mostly fear-based) grandmother, on the Lower East Side of New York.  We don't know what happened to their parents. The boys are experiencing a boatload of quite natural adolescent horniness, and what to do with it all becomes a prominent theme. Their awkward and lovely entrance into and management of this life phase is so well depicted. Victor, an adorable guy, tries to pull off the macho persona, but his bit of awkwardness and tenderness are the ultimate girl magnets, especially for Judy (Judy Marte).  Nino ( Silvestre Rasuk), the slightly younger brother, is also such a legitimate sensitive hormone-galvanized character. None of these roles is caricaturesque.  All the acting is standout, as are the directing, filming, editing, et al. Casting is obviously top notch.  Wow!!!",1471478400,,1111,5.076923076923077

1841301,5,B00008EY7D,"Raising Victor Vargas is one of my favorite films.  Set in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, it delicately explores the human moments of pain and uncertainty as Latino teens experience their first romances.  It seemed more real than acted.  The grandmother was played by a 74-year-old who had never acted and she was wonderfully free of  artifice.  In the film Victor learns that becoming a man is more than macho as he responds to the demands of winning the woman he wants, offering support to his younger (often aggravating) siblings, and dealing with the harsh and wrongheaded criticisms of his grandmother.",1376179200,,610,4.9411764705882355

1841304,5,B00008EY7D,"One of the best independent films I've seen. Everything on film looks so natural and realistic. Victor Rasuk plays Victor Vargas, an adolescent Dominican who lives on the lower east side of New York. Victor lives with his goody-two-shoes brother, quick witted little sister, and watchful grandmother. He has his eye on a girl named Judy Marte, but struggles to gain her affections. The opening scene is quite funny and awkward. I think what pleases most audiences while watching Raising Victor Vargas, is the quality of acting amongst the kids. They act like a real family who argues with each other on a daily basis. There is a scene where Victor is showing Judy photos of his family. He days, ""there's my sister, but she's fat now."" I just thought this was funny. As if her being fat has anything to do with who she is or her personality, or something we should base our judgment on her for. The sister, Vicky De La Cruz (Krystal Rodriguez, who did an amazing job in this film) was really funny. She snaps back at her brothers in defense. She always knows what's going on with Victor and his personal agenda. She does well to install anxiety in Victor about his relationship with ""Fat Donna"". Victor is so corny in his attempts to seduce Judy. He's got a lot of confidence in himself, which comes off as arrogance of course. My favorite scene was when he showed her the baby chick in the filing cabinet. So heartwarming. In the meantime, Judy's friend Melonie has been talking to Victor's friend in private for lots of awkward flirting and messing around. Over time, Victor eventually gains Judy's trust by going out for walks with her and trying to entertain her. Overall though, Victor poses to be a troublesome teenager for his grandmother to raise. That grandmother gives the boys no privacy whatsoever. She considers Victor a bad influence for the rest of the family and asks him to leave the home when she catches Victor's brother doing something sinful. The child protective services rejected this and told her to take victor back home. The family must stay together.  All in all, Raising Victor Vargas is an illuminating, comical, and down to earth film of growing up and the confusion and awkwardness that comes with it. Such a cute film that's good to watch if you want something realistic.",1312848000,,2302,4.712158808933003
1841305,5,B00008EY7D,"I happened upon ""Raising Victor Vargas"" by chance.  I was surfing my cable channels on Sunday night and stopped at Indieplex.  The movie immediately seemed interesting and quite unlike all of the big-budget movies I had been watching on the usual cable channels.  The characters were so realistic that it was as if I was watching a reality tv show.  However, this was much better than any of those reality tv shows that are so scripted that they are beginning to turn into ""non-reality shows.""  While I watched the movie, I got this feeling that the characters were real.  In the credits at the end of the movie, I discovered that Victor and Nino are brothers in real life.  Their sister and grandmother were realistically portrayed as well.  While watching the movie, I noticed subtleties that made it even more realistic such as the way that Nino showed his brotherly love for Victor while sleeping in the same bed as him and the manner in which Victor finally kissed Judy.  It was obviously his first ""real"" kiss.  The setting became an integral part of the movie as well.  Victor's apartment and the streets were real and made me feel as if I could walk right onto the set.  The movie was so endearing that I did not want it to end.  I kept looking at the clock hoping that it would not be over.  I hardly ever do this when watching a movie.  I highly recommend that you watch the movie, especially if you are looking for a change of pace from the usual big-budget movies that are being produced nowadays. The movie left me wondering what Victor, Judy, and Nino would be doing today.",1311638400,,1587,4.519298245614035
1841306,1,B00008EY7D,"Gaah!  How this ill-lit little movie ever got tagged ""comedy"" is beyond me.  Hopeless lives, clueless kids.  The boys wanting sex to prove they're men (right ... 16-year-old, uneducated, unemployed, and apparently unaquainted with any grown-up men!) The girls wanting to belong to a man so they'll be less likely to get gang-raped.  It's as though the director fantasizes his teenagers never take a look outside the projects, and how likely is that?

So much more knowledgeable, accurate and unforced than seemingly every other coming of age/young love story, Raising Victor Vargas is by turns sweet, harsh, funny, and touching in its story of several weeks in the title character's life; short, realistic, and decidedly unformulaic, this is a small treasure of a film.",1247788800,,336,5.222222222222222

Sex is in the air for almost everyone in the movie which takes a sympathetic look at the perils of growing up. Victor is interested in Judy, his younger sister Vicky may or may not be interested in Judy's younger brother Carlos who is definitely interested in her. Victor's younger brother is becoming interested in sex as his body enters adolescence. Their grandmother, a strict Catholic immigrant from the Dominican Republic has her hands full trying to keep these kids on the straight and narrow and isn't quite sure how to deal with this outbreak of sexuality which she finds deeply threatening.
These are basically all good kids trying to find their way -- but there are temptations and dangers out there which could easily lure them on to the wrong path.
This movie feels right -- the performances seem authentic and the characters feel real. I enjoyed it greatly.",1224892800,,967,4.831325301204819
1841339,5,B00008EY7D,"This movie and the characters in it are so real. It describes exactly the grittiness, people and energy of the New York that I love. They are rude, in-your-face, and therefore incredibly fascinating to be with. Having lived there for 10 years, I felt like the characters are my neighbours and friends.

Some reviewers thought this is about poverty or limited resource or the rough life of an urban hispanic youth. I don't think you will feel that way if you ever tasted life in the Big Apple. This is about the incredible cauldron of human beings living densely on a small island. While I lived a life of relative affluence and privilege while in New York, I know many friends who live in the Lower East Side and in homes not very different from the one in the movie. But their lives are not improvished, or limited, and they don't feel that way themselves. They are incredibly interesting, romantic and full of sparkle and energy. I guess that is the reason why the Lower East Side is now becoming yuppiefied!",1162512000,,1010,4.580110497237569

In Raising Victor Vargas you basically get to know two teenage guys Victor who has a cocky and arrogent swagger and his friend Harold who is really just along for the ride that is victor's life. What's interesting about the movie is that the girl Victor wants is constantly harassed all day every day by guys that want her and Victor becomes one of them. This movie becomes an addiction after the first time you watch it, you can't really explain every detail you just have to see it and you really can't give any of the film away because its a life and you watch a boy become a man. I love that Victor and Judy never have sex and to me it increases the amount of love showing that Victor finally learned what he was meant to be instead of the womanizer he was trying to be.",1137024000,,940,4.198895027624309
1841342,5,B00008EY7D,"Victor is a teenager living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, trying to grow up and become a man, in spite of everything that is thrown his way. First of all, Grandma, his grandmother that is raising him and his brother and sister, is a real ball-breaker. She throws him out, only to be told it is illegal to put minors out on the streets in the USA. She thinks he is a horibble influence on his brother Nino, the grandmother's unabashed favorite. Nino is just reaching the age where he is spending literally hours in the bathroom with dirty magazines, and when Grandma walks in and sees him going to town, she blames it all on Victor. The fights between the siblings seem to real and relevant. The language used is vulgar and yet accurate. Everything that Victor is concerned about...the neighborhood not knowing he is sleeping with Fat Donna, his crush on Juicy Judy, is amusing and reminds one of being a teenager. There is much more depth to this movie than I would have expected, and Victor Rasuk, who plays Victor Vargas, is a force to be reckoned with.",1133395200,,1062,4.507772020725389

It had a few good laughs, lots of sibling rivalry drama, disfunctional teen love/infatuation, an overprotective grandmother caretaker who doesn't know what to do, etc.

1841344,4,B00008EY7D,"""Raising Victor Vargas"" is a good 'little' film that demonstrates you don't need multi-multi-million dollar production and marketing budgets and Michael Bay-style execution to create a quality product.  Director/writer Peter Sollett worked within an $800K budget to release a high-quality movie, one that met with critical success and was rewarded with a good run at art houses across the country.  The result was a nice little $2.8m worldwide gross (Sollett's film was released in France under the fairly faithful title of ""Long Way Home"").  This film is an outgrowth of a short Sollett released in 2000 called ""Five Feet High and Rising.""

It's neat seeing brothers Victor and Silvestre Rasuk as brothers Victor and Nino - they make a very believable on-screen family unit.  But the real star here is Judy Marte as Victor's love interest ('target' is more like it) ""Juicy"" Judy Gonzalez, a striking and talented girl who is certainly headed for greater things.  One would hope that ""Victor Vargas"" is remembered years from now as her liftoff point.  She certainly held serve in her next release - 2004's ""On the Outs"" - for which she was nominated as Best Female Lead by the Independent Spirit Awards.",1126742400,,1203,5.015075376884422
1841345,5,B00008EY7D,"Victor is a Dominican teen coming of age in a poor neighborhood on New York's Lower East Side. Partly out of attraction and partly out of a desire to improve his reputation, Victor pursues Judy - the neighborhood hottie. Judy at first ignores Victor's overbearing advances. But she later allows him to be her ""man"" as a means of warding off the other guys on the street who are constantly harassing her.

Meanwhile Victor has a difficult home life to deal with. His very traditional grandmother is always upset with him because she sees him as providing a ""bad example"" to his younger siblings, Vicki and Nino. Victor and sister Vicki are also constantly arguing, while younger brother Nino is a good ""church boy"" who longs to meet girls like his older brother. Grandmother is a well intentioned and charming character who sometimes goes a bit too far in her efforts to control the teen-agers. Nino is perhaps the most sensitive and intelligent member of the family. He is gradmother's favorite but is also experiencing the awakening of his adolescent sexuality. His discovered masturbation and grandmother's extreme reaction to it provide one of the best and funniest scenes in the movie. Meanwhile Vicki has her own romantic problems as she endures the awkward advances of Judy's brother Carlos, a nervous but sweet ""gordito"".

Meanwhile Judy has started to develop feelings for Victor as he reveals his true self rather than the phony playboy he was trying to be. The movie culminates in an excellent scene where both the grandmother and the teen-agers realize that they must learn to respect and trust each other if family happiness is ever to be achieved.

With all the big money being spent on mindless Hollywood blockbusters. It is a pleasure to find a low-budget indie film like this where quality filmmaking tells a sincere and realistic story of young love in a place where most of us never venture. The acting is terrific, the portrayal of Dominican culture in New York seems authentic and the movie has more heart and brains than most big-budget action flicks can even dream of.

1841346,5,B00008EY7D,"Raising Victor Vargas one of the most realistic movies that I have ever seen. Now the reason for me saying this is because I come from a Dominican background and seeing the movie made me think about when I lived in Washington Heights. I mean maybe to person who has been brought up in the suburban setting they really wouldn't know what the real ghetto New York would be like. A teenage boy trying to impress his homeboys will only speak in Ebonics for those who don't know what that is it is slang. I have been brought up in both settings, so I do know what I am talking about. To me the movie was like watching my ghetto aunts with their beliefs from the Dominican Republic always acting strange to those who don't know the custom. I think the movie was a success and haven't met one person who is from the HEIGHTZ who hasn't liked it and hasn't found something in common with Victor's character.

My problem is that it not only fell short of the hype, but it actually never came even remotely close.

The characters were completely unreal.  Having characters swear a lot does not make them real, no matter what the hype machine says.  It's a trite attempt at hiding any lack of understanding of the characters.

But even worse was the way the film was made.  The diretor, Mr. Sollett, made absolutely no attempt at using the tools of filmmaking, opting instead to bathe the entire movie in an annoying reddish light that never changed and to shake the camera constantly for an hour and a half.

My guess is he did it so he could hype his movie as ""documentary-style"" or some such.  Well, Mr. Sollett, this isn't documentary-style, it's just imcompetent and only serves to highlight the complete fakeness of the whole film, which was designed to superficially appear ""real"" (which apparently impressed the critics who are always ready and willing to applaud incompetence as art) while eschewing any attempt at true characters and actual filmmaking.

I'm sick of Hollywood blockbusters about comic book action heroes that have nothing remotely in common with anything resembling real life.  I've been a fan of Miramax since they began.  I really liked ""Whale Rider.""  I'm a huge fan of foreign movies like ""Cinema Paradiso,"" ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" ""The Bicycle Thief,"" ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"" ""Mediterraneo"" and countless others.  I think much (if not most) of what Hollywood perpetrates these days is pure trash.  Well, despite all that, despite the fact that I really wanted to like this movie, I'm sorry, even though this is honest storytelling, honestly, the story isn't worth telling.  I watched and yawned, occasionally chuckled, but mostly I didn't care at all about what happened to Victor Vargas or any of those around him.  Perhaps that says something about me as a human being.  Maybe I'm too comfortable living in the suburbs, going to the malls, watching foreign films in the comfort of my living room, sending my kids off to mostly white schools and soccer camps.  Whatever.  No matter what you might think about me, though, it doesn't change the fact that this movie, despite what the critics will tell you -- critics who I generally agree with -- Victor Vargas, the character and the movie, are just plain boring.  Everyday life isn't exciting.  That's why we go to the movies.  That's why we read books.  That's why we go to the theater, the opera, concerts, sporting events.  That's why we change jobs, take vacations, take up hobbies, have affairs, go back to school and leave our spouses and families in search of something we can't put our fingers on.  Because real life just isn't that interesting, at least not all the time.  Certainly, it doesn't always make for interesting movies.  ""Raising Victor Vargas"" is case in point.  It proves that art is not life.  Art is a heightening of life.  I can watch the grass grow, the paint peal, the bird take flight, the young couple hold hands, the addict get high and the cop make his bust whenever I feel like it.  And if I want to watch a movie about the problems of youth growing up in New York or anywhere else in America, I'll find a worthy documentary.  But art should make any of those events unusual and interesting, not ordinary and boring.  Art needs an audience after all.  Don't waste your time on Victor Vargas; it's real, it has a message, it's well acted, well directed, but it's definitely not a story that needed telling.  And it's not art.

1841385,4,B00008EY7D,"""Raising Victor Vargas"" is an independent film by Peter Sollett. In a family of Dominicans, grandma rules the little New York City apartment with gray-haired steel. Victor is the older brother, maybe sixteen years old who is rejecting Grandmas conservative Catholic morals. He fancies himself a ladies man. His younger brother hangs on his brother's every word about girls. Victor's younger teen sister has a new admirer who absolutely loves her with vomit and tears. Victor is physically experienced, but he knows little about a girl's psyche. Victor gets caught boinking the local fat girl and his Romeo credentials are tarnished, so he campaigns to hook up with a juicy honey. All the scenes are urban and poor. The Latin kids are American in temperament, but as in all classic coming-to-America immigrant stories, the tension is created by clashes between the emerging young and the older generation.

1841417,5,B00008EY7D,"Although independent films such as this have virtually no DVD extras, sometimes the subtleties of the film itself can more easily be grasped on the small screen than in the theater.  I saw ""Raising Victor Vargas"" in both venues, and preferred the intimacy of the DVD.
""Juicy Judy"", played by Judy Marte in Peter Sollett's 2003 independent film, ""Raising Victor Vargas"" has no intention of being impressed by the insouciant Victor (Victor Rasuk) of title fame. She's grown through adolescence in the poor area of New York's lower east side.  She's remained aloof to the enticements that come to her because of her beauty and look of wariness.  She prefers to spend her time with best friend Melonie (Melonie Diaz), talking about life and love; exasperated by how much she is approached by men and boys.  She's drawn a shell about herself, her composure untouched, her lack of trust in anyone outside Melonie and her family is palpable.  We see her early on with only one gesture of instantaneous emotion, and that is when she impulsively hugs and kisses her chubby little brother at the community pool.  If Director Sollett missed anything in this movie, it is a better glimpse of Judy's family life, what things contributed to her sense of pride and why she is so comfortable in her aloneness, not falling prey to the syndrome that is pride and risk-taking by beautiful young girls.
We see Judy through the eyes of  Victor Vargas.  Victor appears to be much younger than he is - he's trying to live down a tryst with the ""fat girl"" Donna, in the neighborhood.  Victor has been practicing his initial sexual moves with Donna, and, in the opening scene, they are clumsy and almost endearing.  Less so is the speed with which he discards Donna.  He needs to score with the beautiful Judy, who he sees at the neighborhood pool.

Undaunted by her declarations that ""she has a man"", he begins to pursue her, but in a manner that his own vulnerabilities show through.  Judy begins to relax by having him around, senses that she can trust him, decides that he can at least be the brunt of others' advances to her, if he is her man.  In a funny aside, friend Melonie shows absolutely no restraint with Victor's buddy, immediately beginning a teenage love affair.
Unlike his approach to Judy, Sollett allows us to see the manner in which Victor was raised, and it is through this understanding that we are drawn to him.  Arrogant in his street persona, Victor is too open to not show his own fears and insecurities.  He lives with his Grandma (the delightful Altagracia Guzman) and has to share a room in their crowded flat with younger sister Vicki (Krystal Roderiguez) and youngest brother Nino (Rasuk's brother Silvestre Rasuk)- all three are adolescents.  It is obvious from the get go that the friction in the family is between Victor and the irascible Vicki and Victor and his grandma.
Raised on a peaceful farm in the Dominican Republic, Grandma tries hard to get used to city life.  She has a straightforward way of dealing with indiscretions by the children.  She is upset when Victor and Vicki fight over the phone, and installs a lock on the phone so that no one can use it.  She's at her wits end as the children get older - any small indiscretion by Victor is cause for alarm, and she puts the fear of God in him by taking him to DCF and trying to give up her right to raise him.  Although she has the grace to back down from her position, she's frightened all three kids by the lengths she is willing to go for her belief that they need to be a ""nice family"".  She's instilled Catholic rituals in them, and all three accompany her to church.  There is little doubt that she's had little education, and speaks English that is heavily accented.  Grandma's Achilles heel is Nino, but then, Nino is so awkward, so loving and real, that it is hard for anyone to resist him.  Nino is struggling with puberty, and a humorous incident of Grandma finding him masturbating in the bathroom is made all the more so by Grandma's insistence that it must be Victor who taught him to sin.
Victor's two worlds come together by his own design.  Without a thought of what Judy will think of his family, or his family will think of Judy, he invites her to dinner.  The awkwardness and awareness of the emotional ties between son and family and son and lover are illustrated beautifully by Sollett in a painful scenario that surprisingly, ends well.
Even if you've not recently lived with teenagers, you can sense the passage from the confused and insecure portrayal of early adolescence (Nino and Vicki) to the street-smart, tough talking but even more vulnerable 16 and older teens (Victor and Judy).  You can feel the impact of poverty on the kids, but you can also see real life, not weighted down by crime and violence.  You can sense how strong bonds are formed by the merest willingness of one kid to try to understand another kid, and to talk about what they are felling.  You get a sense of the strength of respect between generations in Hispanic families and the retreat that the family provides from the outside world.
Sollett, previously having won awards for a short film, ""Five Feet High and Rising"", gives a marvelous novella (almost a pseudo-documentary) on the story of first love, on the powerful pull of family relationships, in a simple tale about real people.  I hope he never loses his ability to tell a story as the budgets he is awarded get bigger and bigger.
The camera play is a little awkward, but the sequencing, editing, choices of backdrop and small bits of music are all gems in a realistic film that was one of my Top Ten in 2003.
Those who crave action and intricate plotting, or laugh out loud comedy will not find it in ""Raising Victor Vargas"", a rare little coming of age film with a superb cast of unknowns.
A definite must-see; you'll love the honesty of this film.",1079049600,,5886,4.614573346116971

She said she knew someone who was just like each of one the characters. We were both sorry when the movie ended, because we didn't even feel like we were watching a movie.  It felt more like we were watching, unobserved, friends and family just living their lives.  It didn't feel like there was a script or direction or anything associated with a movie.  It was more like someone just had cameras running capturing the lives of these characters.  At the same time there definitely was a story being told, and it moved at a crisp pace. Everyone in this film was amazingly real and I felt touched by each one of them.  I also felt like I could relate to each of them, and that's amazing because I haven't been a teenager in over 20 years.  I especially enjoyed watching this movie with my teenager, and we ended up seeing it again the next day.  If you have teens at home, this is a good film to watch with them and discuss.  I must say that as a 40-something year old, I was a little bothered by how sexually active the teens in this film were, but apparently that too is today's reality.  Although this film is set in an urban latino neighborhood, I found that I really didn't think much about the characters' ethnicity or culture or economic status while I was watching the movie.

Although the cover and back description as well as other reviews point out the romantic subplot it's really about how he gets along with his family and friends.  What makes this interesting to me is that I don't live in his reality and I don't have a guardian who only speaks fractured English and doesn't know about laws concerning minors. The misunderstandings and generation/culture gap in this film could tear them apart, but it doesn't by God's grace.  It was interesting to me, but it felt a little empty due to the fact that this is fiction acting as a picture of these peoples' everyday life situation so when it ends you're not sure that any progress has been made, only that risk was taken on Victor's part to seal his relationship the girl. What impact has this had on his relationship with his family, this film doesn't know.  It feels like every relationship in this movie is still in it's infancy. It's like Peter Sollett, the director felt that simply showing real situations would be enough to be compelling and entertaining and whole.  'Raising Victor Vargas' may be the first two things, but it doesn't seem complete.  I just hope that he's learned something from this film which borrowed liberally from his approach on his award-winning short film ""Five feet high and Rising."" The short film worked better because it didn't really need to feel like it was a whole because it was short, but it was filled up with so many compelling relationships and elements and truth and reality that it was easy to forget that you were watching something fictional.  In this feature you know that it's supposed to be fictional, however it doesn't provide you with the payoffs that  good fiction bring in terms of character development, payoff, and closure.",1074816000,,1917,4.7155688622754495

Juicy-Judy is given the chance to finally admit that she likes a boy and that she is willing to take a chance on him. And Grandma finally learns how to let go of the children that she is preventing from growing up.
When you watch this film, there is a genuine feeling of peering into the lives of ordinary people in comical yet real situations- this is because the director has found a way to let the real personalities of the individuals come across even though they many of the lines are scripted. The street-smart dialogue is merely there so that you can understand the transitions that these characters go through by the end of the film - you are supposed to see how they mature - so don't be put off by the more vulgar moments of this film - it's worth it.

""Raising Victor Vargas,"" is a coming of age story about love, life, poverty, inner-city, and family.  Though it gives a good slice of culture in the Puerto Rican, Dominican, Latino lower East Side New York it transcends culture as well.  It tells of humanity with ethnicity as an afterthought.
The cast is a group of non-professional actors that seem like they have been acting for years.  This leaves the movie with a documentary feel that focuses on the story of boy becoming a man and a grandmother attempting to hold a family together as best she knows how...she ends up painfully growing too.
There's no big care chases, we don't get to witness people dying on screen, no big explosions or gun fights, but we are riveted by the tale.  It proves the pundits wrong I believe...a movie doesn't have to be big Hollywood to gain an audience.  ""Victor Vargas"" speaks for itself and running the course will keep drawing in audiences by word of mouth and reputation.

In the end, it doesn't seem to matter, but it is certainly a movie that found its way to the heart of a woman who only remembers a very few out of probably hundreds of movies I've seen.  This is one I will remember.
I love Victor, the main character --- his insecurities, his fears, his honesty, and the way he ultimately wants to make himself vulnerable to the young girl he seeks, known as ""Juicy Judy"". I am intrigued by the way their relationship unfolds, the obstacles they face, the advice their friends give on the relationship.  I enjoy the way I see the tearing down of emotional walls, the coming to terms with one's own needs and desires, the importance and necessity of family.  I thought of  the characters long after the movie was returned to the video store. This movie is so much more than what I expected.  The acting is just beyond superb, and every situation in this film is so absolutely believable, you'll remember the days of your adolescence with sweet fondness. This is one of the most honest films I have seen in a long, long time.",1067644800,,1237,4.360869565217391
1841460,4,B00008EY7D,"Sometimes you come across a piece of filmmaking that is SO REAL and true-to-life, it seems as though it were ""reality television"" instead of a ""written for the screen"" type of work.  This movie is SO pure and lucid in its adaptation of hispanic family life, it's scary.  The love and closeness among siblings that border upon idol worship, the fanatical religious matriach who is the heart and soul of the family, the machismo of the developing hispanic male...just everything...every little nuance is very carefully articulated and represented in such refreshing simplicity that it is a pure joy to watch and is as famaliar as apple pie or in this case, ""pernil"".  Loved this movie and would recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates independent filmmaking at its best...when it just ""IS"" and not necessarily trying to be a commentary on life.",1066089600,,848,4.957746478873239
1841461,4,B00008EY7D,"This 2003 independent film is about young love. It was written and directed by 26-year old Peter Sollett, and has all the earmarks of a fresh young filmmaker.
The story is simple.  Victor Vargas, played by Victor Rasuk, is a teenage boy who is looking for love.  He lives with his grandmother, played by Altagracia Guzman, and his younger brother and sister in a poor, but idealized neighborhood in New York City.  His grandmother, who had emigrated from the Dominican Republic years before, clearly loves her grandchildren and does her best to keep the family together.  However, she's a little too quick to consider them depraved simply because Victor is romancing a girl and because his younger brother, played by Silvestre Rusuk, is experimenting with is own sexuality behind closed bathroom doors. In an inspired bit of casting, these two real-life brothers look so much alike that it gives the feel of a real family.
Victor meets the girl of his dreams, Judy Marte, and they begin a romance.  They are both inexperienced and it takes a while for their first kiss.  There are a few twists and turns to the plot, and some obstacles which get in the way, but basically it is just a sweet love story.  One of the most interesting things about the story though is that there are no guns, drugs or violent acts.  They might be living in a neighborhood known for these things but yet they are all remarkably innocent.
I enjoyed the film and thought it was well done. But frankly, it was a little too simple for my personal tastes.  It seemed to me like amateurs doing their best in a first film.  Which, of course, is exactly what it is.  I must give the film an ""A"" for effort though.  And I look forward to watching the growth of this filmmaker.",1065052800,,1746,4.578778135048232
1841462,5,B00008EY7D,"I saw this in theatre and loved it so much that I had to get the DVD to watch again.
The acting is so natural and you almost think that it's a documentary or something. These are everyday people that you see around you all the time.
The actors are not amatures like some reviewers wrote. They are highly skilled impovisers. As the movie was done mostly in improvisation manner.
Sometimes you can't really hear what they say because of it. But that's street talking, so get over it or turn on the subtitle.
Anyway, on the SECOND veiwing, I unexpectedly started crying! That's where Judy opens up to Victor.
This movie is genuinely innosent, and I wish it was my story :)",1064966400,,669,4.4471544715447155

IT WAS FUNNY, BUT WITHOUT BEING DISGUSTING.
I FELT THAT IT ACCURATELY DEPICTED WHAT GROWING UP IS LIKE.
IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE BEST FILMS THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED THIS YEAR.
THE DVD DOES NOT HAVE A THEATRICAL TRAILER, NOR ANY OTHER SPECIAL FEATURES, HOWEVER THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED.
THE ACTING WAS FANTASTIC AND THE STORY WAS BOTH HUMOROUS AND SERIOUS AT THE SAME TIME.
THIS IS GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!! SEE IT SOON!!!",1063929600,,454,4.6875
1841464,5,B00008EY7D,"""Raising Victor Vargas"" sort of sneaks up on you... at first, nothing much seems to be happening. Victor is a typical loud-mouthed kid, trying to impress his friends with his sexual conquests. One girl in particular catches his eye... she's very attractive and having her as a girlfriend would really boost his reputation as a lady-killer. Victor's efforts seem doomed to failure, though, because the girl he's after can see right through him; she's got a few dozen other guys just like him harassing her every day.
As the film progresses, though, we begin to see that all the main characters are trapped in their own particular behaviors/attitudes, which serve to protect them but which also keep the rest of the world at a distance. Victor's cocky arrogance, his grandmother's intolerance, his little brother's ""good""-ness, and the not-quite-girlfriend's total distrust of men... these all begin to limit the characters and to prevent them from giving of themselves.
This is a quiet, brilliant little film... it sort of reminded me of ""Kids,"" but without the bleak outlook on human nature. Here, people are capable of change, though it doesn't come easily...",1063497600,,1160,5.110526315789474
1841465,4,B00008EY7D,"Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk) is a teenager from Manhattan's Lower East Side. He lives with his grandmother (Altagracia Guzman), his little brother Nino (Silvestre Rasuk) and his sister Vicki (Krystal Rodriguez). He's a nice guy. He likes to impress his friends and dole out dating advice to his younger brother. He likes a young woman from the neighborhood named Judy (Judy Marte). Judy is aloof, jaded by all the men who hit on her constantly and not interested in having a boyfriend. But Victor is persistent and does his best to be a gentleman towards her. Judy finally consents to being Victor's woman, mostly so she can tell her other suitors that she is spoken for. As she spends more time with Victor, Judy comes to like his earnest charm and considers the possibility of having a real relationship. Meanwhile, Victor's grandmother, a woman in her 70's who grew up on a farm in the Dominican Republic, is at her wits end. Her grandchildren are essentially good kids, but Nino, her favorite, is growing up, and Victor has become an independent young man. Grandma simply doesn't know how to handle the situation. Victor has to make peace with his grandmother and help her understand that they all need each other in spite of their differences.

""Raising Victor Vargas"" reminds me of the ""cinema verite"" style of filmmaking that became fashionable in the 1960's. The film shows us a realistic slice of life and at times has a strong documentary flavor. The film's young cast is wonderful. Victor Vargas is a charismatic and sympathetic young man who makes the audience hope that he is understood by his grandmother and succeeds with his girlfriend. Writer and director Peter Sollett makes everyday events in the lives of these young Hispanic Americans interesting and poignant. Their flirtations, fears, petty squabbles, and family difficulties take on a significance not normally associated with such mundanities, perhaps because we see them so up close that their impact is amplified. ""Raising Victor Vargas"" does an impressive job of focusing our attention on life's details and providing a glimpse of an urban youth culture with which many of us are not familiar.

1841466,5,B00008EY7D,"RAISING VICTOR VARGAS is a minor miracle.  Peter Sollett has gathered an extraordinary cast of non-professional (in category name only!) actors, often using their own first names, and has given us a simple story of coming of age in a setting that is the antithesis of our previous views of Manhattan's Lower East Side.  The usual films made in or about this area are dark, crime-cancered, grafitti-ized, unintelligible gang dramas.  Rarely has any director had the courage to look at the ""survivors"" of poverty in such a simple and loving way.  Victor Vargas (an inordinately talented Victor Rasuk), one of three siblings left in the care of their grandma (played with infinite wisdom and beauty by Altagracia Guzman)is of the age where he is acting the role of the macho ladies' man and is surrounded by friends who let is be known that he is getting his satisfaction from a fat loose girl they all tease.  Victor reacts and pledges to conquer Judy ( a beautiful Judy Marte), a girl who is wise to the hormonal drives of the young men she confronts in her seedy neighborhood. Director Sollett follows the emotional maturation of these two as they slowly and with growing wisdom approach a relationship.  Along this path is the hilarious ranting of Grandma who fears her family is falling into the depths of sin.
The setting, though on location and anything but beautiful, is photographed as though it were as meaningful as a Romeo/Juliet Italy.  Oddly, the music in the background is Bach instead of Hip Hop - a hint of the sensitivity in store for you as you discover how fine simple storytelling on film can be in the hands of committed actors and crew.  Highly recommended.",1062028800,,1677,4.758620689655173

And believe it or not this takes place in the Lower East Side (LES) of Manhatten. This movie takes otherwise stereotypical characters and allows them to evolve. Victor realizes that in order to get what he wants, he must grow and mature and understand what becoming a man is really all about. As a result, his ""wants"" are redefined. Judy must relax her cast-iron defenses if she is ever to truly love anybody and extract joy from the experience. A superb job by PROFESSIONAL actors.",1057622400,,583,4.782178217821782

7982228,5,B00008EY7D,"Write a review? As a Neuyorican -Italian growing up in the Washington Heights Section of New York in the early 1960's,  I could feel the rhythms and pulses of our beautiful culture course in the veins of this movie. This movie was full of life. It transmitted the love of our beautiful people in struggle. We danced, and loved, and drank, and seduced each other because we were destined to find love and beauty in the face of such pain. All the  Caribbean blood- Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban- came to the cold winters of New York. Our Grandmothers came through journeys of such pain and sufferings that our poverty was wealth by comparison. And in their cultures they clung to what they knew was right but pure obedience could come come at a great price. As first generations, we loved them by finding a way to respect them for who they were as we found our way in this confusing world where the prejudice was so thick it weighed heavy on hearts. We saw generations of our children put into the slowest classes because they did not speak English. Bilingual education was not even entertained back then. Dominicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans were all facing a kind of prejudice that was much easier to handle on the one hand because it was so blatant but was damaging to our self esteem. Black and Brown skinned children were forsaken in schools that left them ill prepared to enter the ""job world."" Raising Victor Vargas is all about that reality. Raising Victor Vargas is about Life. I'm writing an homage to ""Raising Victor Vargas.""",1493337600,,1532,4.649446494464945
