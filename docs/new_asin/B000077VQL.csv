7974384,5,B000077VQL,"The time has come when humans have become integrated with machines to create a super intelligent, super advanced race hooked up to biological software which, until now, has been susceptible to viruses.

Neo Hong Kong. The year 2097. Man and machine have intertwined themselves to become a more indestructible race. But that is not to last for long. There is an evil cunning and swift--a deadly Virus is taking over Earth faster than they can find a way to defeat it.

Not knowing how to stop the virus, and with answers far from being known, lives are in uncertain fear as they are being viciously attacked and killed. Time is crucial.

A super team called S.T.A.N.D. is run by Captain Raven, and their mission is ridding the planet of the incubator that released a practically undetectable Virus which creates monsters out of its victims. Captain Raven sends his elite team members, Erika, Jovichirov, Mirel, and Macus into the mouth of terror in order to silence the Virus forever.

A mystery man whose nightmares have become so fierce with anger and confusion have led him to Raven, the only person he sees clear in his mind. But these visions leave only one impression--kill Raven.

Serge attempted to succeed with his premonitions of killing Raven, but got caught in the crossfire of the Virus, and by doing so helped slow it down by enabling himself with a high-tech gear nobody else could identify.

Because of this heroic maneuver, Serge saved many lives. Raven now placed Serge on his team. Serge has no identity in the S.T.A.N.D. computer, but Raven has been expecting him.

Each stunning specimen has their own striking personalities and secret pasts that make them all the more interesting to watch.

Will the Virus be defeated, or will all mankind be destroyed trying to do so?

I will tell you this, an awesome member of S.T.A.N.D. will kick that Virus to the outer limits of the stratosphere to free Earth--but at a price, a dear price.

The theme song, ""Rainy Day and Day"" by Dragon Ash was jamming! I liked it a lot--it had substance, and it was a catchy tune that stayed strong and worked itself nicely into the film.

Sexy, fun, and a one heck of a visual ride! Animation never looked so good!",1120348800,,2212,4.704663212435233

7974386,4,B000077VQL,"When ""Virus -Virus Buster Serge-"" first came out in 1997, I was really impressed by the storylines and character designs. The characters have a feel of something like ""Weiss Kreuz"" and the animation style of the ""Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture"" or Masami Obari anime style.
I really enjoy anime such as ""Bubblegum Crisis"" and when watching this anime, it reminded me of ""Bubblegum Crisis meets Gatchaman"" and the action is intense and I just felt that this anime television series was just so impressive.
Almost six years later, Manga Entertainment has chose to release this anime television series in the United States and fans of anime series such as ""Bubblegum Crisis"", ""Gatchaman"" or ""Evangelion"" will not be disappointed. It's a solid series about artificially enhanced humans and what happens when digital viruses start to control their hosts. Sounds like Boomers from ""Bubblegum Crisis"" but the difference is the team known as S.T.A.N.D. who are a group of two men and two females with a mysterious teammate or rival named Serge.
The anime is full of action and characters that are very interesting that you'll want to watch more and more. The theme song ""Rainy Day and Day"" by Dragon Ash is awesome and the DVD. What about the DVD?
Well, first let me remind you that this is a television series from back in 1997. The graininess is evident in this anime compared to other television series and it does show it's age. Why that is, I don't know but it's not as crisp and clear compared to other anime television series but it's not terrible but videophiles may be bothered by it.
The other thing that will only bother purists of the original TV series is the change of opening and ending segments. As well as the chapter stops not being at the beginning of the episode perse (beginning of opening segment) but after the opening sgement. Also, the lack of romanizations or translations for the lyrics. For me, this was a bit bothersome but for those who have never seen the series, they probably will not even know this or care.
As for special features, like most mecha related anime, you have your character designs and mecha designs and character information.
All in all, ""Virus"" is still one heck of an anime to watch and a deserves a placement in your collection if you are a fan of the different anime I mentioned earlier.
Check it out!",1043020800,5,2346,4.724390243902439
