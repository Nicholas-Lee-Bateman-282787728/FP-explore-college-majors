2789701,5,B000O3C59M,"Jim, who was part of the generation who rebelled against the values of their parents in the 60's and who fled to Canada rather than participating in the Viet Nam War, is now almost 56.  His wife has recently died after a long illness and he is left alone with his son, Caleb, 27. Jim has built a rustic but beautiful home for his family and established himself in a business as a master carpenter, turning out one-of-a-kind pieces of fine furnitre, along with Caleb.

His business is on the verge of failure, however, when a wealthy entrepreneur flies in from America to set up a tourist attraction in the area.  It turns out that this fellow, Matt, was once a rival for the attentions of Jim's former wife, and may even be the biological father of Caleb.  He offers Caleb and Jim a deal to make furniture for the proposed resort if they will cut a few corners and compromise the integrity of their work.  Caleb goes for the deal which cuts Jim to the quick, violating everything he stands for.

A latter day hippie couple come through and Jim offers them a place on his land to erect their teepee.  He feels warmly towards them as they remind him of his early days.  They irk Caleb, though, with their righteous rhetoric and impractical ideas.  History repeats itself as the girl seduces Caleb and the possibility exists that he may have fathered her child...

The tensions between generations and values is brilliantly told in this film.  The whole cast is perfect.  The gorgeous scenery adds to the enoyment of the film.  My only complaint is that the ending was a tiny bit disappointing.  However I strongly recommend the film.",1188345600,12,1631,4.5793103448275865
2789702,4,B000O3C59M,"The Film Movement DVD ""A Simple Curve"" is set in the Kootenays region of Canada, perhaps around the Arrow Lakes.  The gorgeous mountain and water scenery is breathtaking. Kris Lemche who was in ""Final Destination 3"" & ""The Last Casino"" (2004) plays the lead, Caleb. Caleb is 27 years old and lives with his father. They are in the process of getting over the death of their mother/wife who died of an extended illness. Lemche's excellent performance anchors the film, as his character anchors the family in the story.  Michael Hogan who has a long film career with over 20 features including ""The Peanut Butter Solution,"" ""Cowboys Don't Cry,"" & ""Solitaire"" for which he won a Genie Award -- Canada's Oscar -- for Best Supporting Actor plays the father Jim. Jim is an old hippie who likes to skinny dip au natural and is a master carpenter. However, the carpentry business he and his son have established is not doing well as cheaper products made of particleboard supplant more expensive real wood products. Matt Craven comes along as Matt. Craven is a recognizable face and has played in films like ""Blue Steel"" (1990), ""A Few Good Men"" (1992) & ""Crimson Tide"" (1995). His character is Matt, a contractor who tries to promote a lodge on the lake that would throw a lot of business toward Caleb & Jim and keep them solvent. There is a friction between Matt & Jim. We learn that both shared the affections of Jim's wife before they were married, to the point that Caleb could be either one's son. This revelation occurs as the lodge deal falls through.  Caleb tells both of his fathers to F off & departs on a nomadic adventure. Meanwhile, two young hippies played by Pascale Hutton & Sarah Lind (Erika) have moved in. In a night of mistaken passion, Caleb repeats his father's pattern by sleeping with Erika. They have a daughter; and the father wonders if he or Caleb is the biological father.

The film starts out a bit slowly and has kind of an open ending to it as Caleb returns to the valley. I'm sure this is intended to impress one as being artistic, leaving suggestion as to what could occur. It strikes me more as half-baked.  Themes of grief and adjustment resonate; although it took me about 3 sittings to watch the DVD. I was glad I'd seen it, but my life would have been complete without it too.  Some of the scenes are cute like Caleb sitting on the open-air outhouse looking at the mountains as his father wants to have a serious chat. There are some sweet father-son moments as Caleb throws a surprise birthday party for Jim.

The film won the Nantucket Film Festival, Cinefest Sudbury International Film Festival & Two Leo Awards as well as being an official selection of both the Toronto & Vancouver International Film Festivals.

The short film ""Lucky"" by director Avie Luthra is quite moving.  From South Africa and the United Kingdom, it follows the story of a young boy named Lucky who heads to the city of Durban when his mother dies of AIDS.  His uncle appears ill prepared to assume the guardianship of a young boy, kicking him out in the middle of the night so he can entertain a local girl.  An Indian woman who lives several apartments down is a racist and apparently hates Zulus.  Without friends, Lucky brings her water to try to befriend her.  He also wants to listen to a cassette tape his mother left for him.  The Indian woman hits him in the face with a broom, causing bruises.  Eventually, the Indian woman feeds the boy and allows him to sleep on her sofa.  The film is a positive one, speaking to the need for human understanding over racial stereotyping.  The short won the Best Short Film Award at the Aspen Film Festival.  The brilliance of the 18-minute short earns this DVD another star.  :)  Enjoy!",1173398400,8,3742,4.59009009009009

The plot and screen play were very good.  The scenery was extraordinary.  The interplay of the people was interesting. The characters were well developed and fairly complex.  There is some language in a few scenes and one scene with nudity.  Sex scenes are pretty much like the 50's or 60's style.  Probably too deep for most younger people to enjoy - they'll understand it but not think much of it.  Knowing the 50's and 60's culture is a help in understanding the movie.  I recommend it when you want to watch a movie to think about rather than just to entertain.  It is about father-son relations, being set in your ways vs flexibility, accepting life as it is, responsibility - when to take it and when to leave it.

2789746,5,B000O3C59M,"Well, I'm exaggerating, but Michael Hogan's eastern Canada accent seeps through quite a lot for a supposed American living in western Canada. Likewise, both Matt and Michael are a few years too young to be playing draft dodgers, but all in all, they did a great job.

This is a sweet, sweet little movie, and I have lived among similar folk in this very Kootenay setting long enough to see real people in place of many of these charming characterizations. And yes, this place really is as beautiful as it looks in the movie.

Michael's character of Jim is suitably stubborn, blinkered and irritating, but despite him being an artisan, he seems like too much of a yokel for many of the draft dodgers I have known over the years. Most of them are more academically inclined, having less of the Hick Factor.

The movie deals with all kinds of coming of age and cross-cultural/cross-generational issues and is heavily laced with love/sex interests and humor - I loved the carob/halva scene above all. I'm sure many Kootenay kids feel his pain.

2789747,5,B000O3C59M,"A Simple Curve is a down to earth, favorite film of all time.  Plus, this was the writer/producer/director's FIRST feature...how remarkable!

The story is simple, yet intriguing with interesting off-beat storylines (e.g. placenta consumption, the ""simple"" curve, and more).  The location is absolutely stunning (we LOVE Vancouver, BC). The characters are very attractive too--especially the ecotourism pilot; and the soundtrack is absolutely divine!

2789748,5,B000O3C59M,"This is a great sleeper.  Just happened to see it by chance.  Wasn't really promoted (at least, not that I saw).  It's well written, directed and edited, with some great scenes.  If you enjoy understated comedy, you'll probably like this.  Very funny, touching movie.",1252800000,,267,4.9772727272727275
2789749,4,B000O3C59M,"A Simple Curve is the coming of age story of Caleb, a young man who loves his father and wants to respect his father's uncompromising standards for making furniture, but who is willing to compromise artistic purity if it will pay the bills. This difference with his father leads inevitably to a conflict over ideals. On a deeper level, when the woman he is falling in love with asks him a searching question about his desires and his connection to the place of his birth, he must examine himself and find his true identity.

The writer and director, Aubrey Nealon, was born and raised in the Slocan Valley where the film is set, and he paints a warm and complex picture of the characters and settings of his childhood. Having visited the Valley often in my own youth, I was pleased to find that the film is faithful to the culture and fabric of the place, quirks, qualities, beauty, warts, and all.

Many of the details of the film seem to echo Nealon's own life, and the authenticity of the film is likely derived from his first hand experience. Beyond this ""true to life"" quality the film shines with the competence of the acting and direction.

Michael Hogan plays Colonel Saul Tigh on Battlestar Gallactica so it took me a moment or two to adjust to him as Caleb's draft dodging hippie father grown old in a rural setting. But once I adjusted, I gained a new appreciation for Hogan as an actor. He is equal parts grieving curmudgeon and lovable craftsman. Kris Lemche fills the character of Caleb with the right mix of anxiety and stability, so that you really end up rooting for Caleb to make the right choices, difficult as they are.

I also liked that the film is consistently funny, that it faces morally challenging issues, and at the same time does not provide clear answers. Patterns emerge, and Caleb makes his way between the strange attractors of love, lust, destiny, and identity, ultimately maturing and returning to his own authentic self.

If you love the Slocan Valley, or perhaps still hold on to some of those hippie ideals, or maybe you just like well drawn character studies, then this film will entertain and reward you. It really is a gem.",1246752000,,2164,4.6103896103896105

2789751,4,B000O3C59M,"A SIMPLE CURVE is a little Canadian film courtesy of Film Movement that has a nice style and solid cast to relate what happened to the men and women who fled to Canada to avoid the draft for the Vietnam War.  Since the Baby Boomer Generation now makes up a large part of the audience this story will resonate with both parents and children. 'A simple curve' may refer to the woodworking genius of the main characters, but is also refers to the results of happenstance from a period of free love resulting in some questions about biological parenting, throwing a simple curve into the philosophy of family.

Caleb (Kris Lemche) lives in the extraordinarily beautiful mountainous wilds of British Columbia with his father Jim (Michael Hogan), barely surviving on the meager income of their woodworking shop.  The mother/wife died some time ago from a protracted illness and that event has both bonded the father/son and created a festering pain they must face daily.  Into their lives returns an old friend of Jim's from the hippie days of expatriation: Matthew (Matt Craven) returns from the US as a man of means by way of ecotourism and plans to build a lodge on the lake near Jim and Caleb.  Tension exists between Jim and Matthew, but Caleb sees Matthew as a financial savior of his business as Matthew consents to have Caleb and Jim (unbeknownst to Jim) make furniture prototypes for the lodge.  Caleb appears wedded to his hometown, dating only women who live there and traveling little - a factor that encourages many people to advise Caleb to make the break from his family and seek his own identity.  A current hippie couple - Erika (Sarah Lind) and Buck (Kett Turton) - find their way into Jim's graces and live on the property, a re-creation in many ways of Jim's and Matthew's past.  The peak of change in the story occurs when Matthew loses funding for the lodge (and thus the monetary security of Jim and Caleb's business) and that tension reveals another secret curve: both Jim and Matthew sexually shared Caleb's mother and his true biological father is left in question. Caleb is devastated and witnesses another curve: he has performed a similar act with Erika resulting in a pregnancy that could be the progeny of either Caleb or Buck. Matthew once again leaves the beauty of Canada for the security of the US and Jim and Caleb are left to sort things out, finding new lives of their own with some surprising circumstances.

Aubrey Nealon wrote and directed this little film and on most levels it is successful.  The cast is solid but the star of the film is the majestic beauty of British Columbia - and that seems to be intended.  This is not a great movie but it is a worthy exploration into the fallout of the Hippie Generation.  For many of us it simply clicks!  Grady Harp, December 07",1198800000,15,2808,4.659919028340081
