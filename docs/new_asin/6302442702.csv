7826356,1,6302442702,"""The JFK Conspiracy"", hosted and narrated (very stiffly and awkwardly) by actor James Earl Jones, is a 98-minute program released on VHS by ""BMG Video"" in 1992.

This program is just dreadful in every respect. Of course, the subject matter deals with the various theories of how President John F. Kennedy was supposedly killed by more than just one lone gunman in 1963. Multiple (unsupported) conspiracy angles are explored in this melodramatic, roundtable-type of presentation, with Mr. Jones serving as moderator (complete with a token 'clipboard' in hand).

James Earl seems rather nervous the whole time and mangles a lot of his pre-scripted lines of dialogue while consulting with the assassination ""experts"" that are on hand here. This whole thing is just awful, IMO. I say this from my viewpoint as a devout believer in the Warren Commission's ""Single Assassin"" conclusion. But, I'm doubtful that even very many conspiracy buffs will find this particular program very enjoyable.

Naturally, in a program like this one, the participants attempt to rip the ""Single-Bullet Theory"" (SBT) to shreds. But I challenge any ""reasonable"" person interested in the JFK case to evaluate the ""conspiracy alternatives"" that would need to replace the SBT and come up with ANY theory that's anywhere near as credible or believable or logical as the SBT. Any non-SBT alternative theory requires FAR greater leaps of faith and produces MANY more ""unexplainable"" loose ends than does the official Single-Bullet Theory version of events.

In probing this ""SBT"" subject a bit further, let's consider the following.........

If the SBT is not the correct scenario to explain the simultaneous wounding of President Kennedy and Governor John Connally, then we are forced to believe that not just ONE, but TWO, rifle bullets failed to penetrate all the way through the neck and back of JFK -- from probably high-powered weapons. Logical?

Even if the Conspiracy Theorists (""CTers"") want to argue that the ""angles"" are not precisely dead-on correct for the SBT to ""work"" or ""align"" properly back to assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's ""Sniper's Nest"" window in the Texas School Book Depository -- in my considered viewpoint, ANY conspiracy theory that we're forced to ""substitute"" for the official SBT falls apart on many, many different levels.

For example -- Here's what certainly MUST have occurred (via the CT account) INSTEAD of the SBT:

1.) Three shots must ""replace"" the one single shot known as the ""SBT"". There IS no way around this first point here. Because LACKING the SBT to explain the throat wound to JFK and both of the victims' separate back wounds, CTers are forced to postulate that one of the two following things occurred........

A.) The bullet that struck JFK did go all the way through him but, somehow spectacularly, MISSED the man sitting right in front of him who was in direct line to receive this bullet and this bullet was then scooped up from inside the limo by plotters after the fact and disposed of AND the damage to the inside of the limousine that was no doubt caused by this bullet was completely eradicated in very short order after the event. Likely (even in a CT world)? Hardly. Especially in light of this WC testimony from Robert Frazier of the FBI......

Mr. SPECTER -- ""Did your examination of the President's limousine disclose any other holes or markings which could have conceivably been caused by a bullet striking the automobile or any part of the automobile?""

Mr. FRAZIER -- ""No, sir.""

-- Or: --

B.) Lacking a shot that goes all the way through JFK, we're left to accept a 3-Shot scenario to explain these wounds to the two victims -- fired by THREE separate gunmen as well (two from the rear and one from the front). Given the very tight timeline as seen via the famous home movie of the assassination filmed by bystander Abraham Zapruder, it would have been virtually impossible for less than three separate gunmen to have peppered JFK & Connally in the allotted timeframe (even if JFK was hit as early on the Z-Film as Z195-Z200, as has been suggested by some theorists).

2.) All three of these (supposedly) entry wounds on JFK & JBC line themselves up in such a fashion on the bodies to give the APPEARANCE that they could have ALL been ""in line"" so as to have been caused by just a single missile passing through both men simultaneously.

3.) The three bullets that are replacing the SBT via a CTer's alternate theory now ALL get lost! Or are ALL disposed of by evil plotters! In either instance, all three bullets that struck Kennedy and Connally are never entered into any kind of official record representing this murder case. Odds please? Is this a logical conclusion to come to?

How could the ""plotters"" have possibly gotten THAT LUCKY so that all three of those whole bullets, in 2 bodies, were never recovered by anyone at Parkland Hospital, and so lucky to NOT have even ONE of these three bullets enter the official record at any time? Especially with regard to the Connally AWOL bullet. Here's a bullet that enters a man who LIVED through the ordeal, and whose body could not be ""controlled"" later at some ""fixed"" or ""phonied"" autopsy by the conspirators (as many CTers believe occurred with respect to JFK's autopsy at Bethesda).

This Connally bullet, IMO, is the KEY bullet that shows beyond any reasonable doubt that no foul play was afoot with respect to the bullets. This unexpected SECOND victim of the assassination attempt (Connally), and yet ANOTHER (third) bullet that is ""conveniently missing"", makes it FAR more difficult to believe in a vast conspiracy and cover-up in this case. What are the odds that the plotters could have ""controlled"" all the trace evidence within TWO victims in such a plot, one of whom survived the shooting?

When combined all together, don't ALL of these CT points that would have HAD to have occurred in order to explain the ""SBT wounds"" AND lack of bullets entering the official record seem just a tad far-fetched and unrealistic?

To me, they're more than just a ""tad"" far-fetched and unreasonable -- they're downright illogical from every point-of-view. It seems to me that any attempts to explain those wounds that were sustained at virtually an identical time by John Kennedy and John Connally in a ""CT light"" fail to hold up the least little bit when held up to the bright light of scrutiny.

If the only way to ""explain away"" the SBT to ""fit"" a conspiracy scenario is to come up with a ""plot"" that includes THREE different shooters, firing THREE bullets into two different victims, from THREE different locations, and incredibly have all three of these missiles pepper the victims in just such a pattern so that it looks like it COULD (even remotely so) be reconciled into a ""SBT"", and THEN (on top of this miracle shooting performance by three different gunmen) to get ALL THREE of these separate bullets to vanish and to never enter the official record -- then, from where I sit, plain ol' common sense is telling me that something's just a bit screwy about this ""CT"" plot which perfectly worked out to appease the WC and its loyal followers.

And -- Any such ""multi-shooter"" scenario is also very unlikely (probability-wise alone) from the popular ""Frame The Patsy Oswald"" standpoint. Would these plotters have deliberately been so foolhardy and utterly reckless as to fire three separate shots into JFK's body (including the head shot), from varying angles, and yet STILL, incredibly, expect every last scrap of ballistic evidence to get traced back to ONLY Lee Oswald's rifle AND get traced back to only Oswald's ""Sniper's Nest"" window in the Depository? They couldn't POSSIBLY have thought that this ""Multi-Shooter Patsy Plan"" could succeed on its BEST day! Could they? (I think not.)

Whereas, the ""LN alternative"" rests (IMO) on the very logical and sound shoulders of the ""SBT"" -- a theory in which all of the following is thoroughly explained.......

1.) Every bullet (totalling 'one' in number) is recovered and enters the official record (Bullet #CE399). There are no mysteries as to any ""missing"" missiles.

2.) The fact that no bullets were found inside JFK or JBC is perfectly logical and to be expected via the SBT. Plus the very important fact that no bullet damage was done to the limo's interior in the back seat areas of the automobile.

3.) All wounds to both men are perfectly consistent with the SBT. The downward, back-to-front and slightly right-to-left ""alignment"" of the wounds suffered by JFK & JBC are, IMO, wholly indicative of a single shot that passed through both men (esp. when factoring in the oblong wound in the back sustained by JBC, plus the lack of bullets found in the bodies, AND the fact that no one ELSE was hit by gunfire in the limousine, AND the fact that no damage was done to the car's rear or jump seats by any missiles during the shooting).

4.) Via the Zapruder Film, the SBT ""holds up"" under intense scrutiny as well (IMO), with both victims reacting to external (bullet) stimulus at virtually an identical time on the film. People will no doubt argue this point until the cows come home, but I still defy ANYONE to look at the Z-Film (running at regular, real-time speed) and tell me they can say with certainty that President Kennedy and Governor Connally are NOT reacting to being hit by a bullet at the very same point in time.

------------

In my opinion, the critics have done little to disprove the SBT. But, on the flip-side of that coin, there have been true-to-life and animated tests performed over the years that have backed up (concretely) the validity of the Single-Bullet Theory. But these tests, too, have been ridiculed as being ""inaccurate"", with ""manufactured"" angles and results, and incorrect measurements utilized. I, however, completely and fervently disagree.

From what I've seen re. these ""tests"" (the FAA simulation, Mr. Dale K. Myers' project, and the 2004 Discovery Channel SBT re-creation, which should, in my view, be VERY convincing to any critic of the theory, but, of course, is not), they've been conducted in an open and wholly above-board and honest manner, with re-creations that are as close to being as accurate as humanly possible (esp. given the ""unknowns"" regarding some measurements -- like the EXACT positioning of Mr. Connally's wrist at the moment the bullet hit him, plus the EXACT positioning of JFK and JBC to each other in the car during the shooting; these things can only be ""guesses"" to a certain extent, no matter which side of the debate you reside on, as I'm sure even all CTers will concur).

What I'd like to see are similar ""Discovery Channel""-like tests done by the CT side, in order to PROVE once and for all their belief that the SBT is so full of holes you could drive the President's X-100 Lincoln convertible through them! Thus far, I've seen NO such tests that would PROVE that either Mr. Myers or The Discovery Channel people got it completely wrong.

Until such proof can be reasonably demonstrated, I truly cannot see how anyone can totally dismiss the possibility (or probability, IMO) that the Single-Bullet Theory is the correct theory in the JFK murder case.

I'd recommend (at all costs) skipping this video and, instead, picking up a copy of something much more rewarding and (IMO) truthful with regard to the JFK case -- i.e.: the aforementioned ""Discovery Channel"" program (called ""JFK: Beyond The Magic Bullet"") or the 2003 ABC-TV documentary, ""The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy"". Another outstanding documentary on the assassination is 1964's ""Four Days In November"".

In closing ..... I challenge anyone who watches the following motion video clip from the Zapruder Film a few times in a row to come to any other conclusion than that both John F. Kennedy and Governor John B. Connally are reacting to being hit by a bullet at precisely the same moment in time (copy-and-paste the link into your web browser to view the clip):
