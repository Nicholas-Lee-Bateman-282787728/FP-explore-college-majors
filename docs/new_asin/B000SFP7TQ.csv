8325718,3,B000SFP7TQ,"A little disappointing. Definitely not for beginners.  It first shows the dance in full (this is beautiful to watch), then gives 3 lessons on some of the body movements 1 Remate, then foot exercise which is a zoom in on feet (this is shown from the side so you don't get to see what the far foot is doing), 2 Ilamada, with foot exercise, and 3 the last Ilamada and foot exercise. The dance is beautiful but it does not show the full choreography (marking etc), so you really need to know what you are doing to fill the gaps. Luckily I purchased this 2nd hand discounted, otherwise would be extremely disappointed.",1521590400,,613,4.473214285714286
