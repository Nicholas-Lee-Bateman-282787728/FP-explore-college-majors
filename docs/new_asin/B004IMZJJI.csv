8430944,4,B004IMZJJI,"The photography is stunning, but I would have enjoyed this DVD much more had I been able to listen to just the nature sounds. The music was often choppy, sometimes irritating, and overpowered the natural sounds when they were even audible. The music diminished the relaxation for me through much of the DVD, so I turned the volume way down and let the incredible scenery truly be the star!",1320278400,5,389,4.6521739130434785
8430945,2,B004IMZJJI,"Before I bought this Blu-ray DVD, I thought only Video and music, not talking, sound should be very good. When I got it and play, I was quite dis pointed, it seems  like there is helicopter sound behind the music, also it's stereo, not 5.1 channel. Picture quality are OK.",1318204800,4,272,4.44

8430947,5,B004IMZJJI,"I bought this DVD because my life was on stress overload! I am a doctoral student which comes with an unbelievable amount of stress. Facing health problems, family issues, and relationship challenges, I was unable to sleep most nights. This DVD is so amazing that I have yet been able to watch it in it's entirety because it lulls me to sleep. If you need to relax, get this one! It's beautiful and peaceful, I love it!!!!!!",1308009600,4,424,4.51948051948052

The DVD captures the striking, serene and gorgeous scenery of the amazing Canadian Rockies and the beautiful music is stellar!  We were very impressed with how deeply relaxing and calming this spectacular video is after a long stressful day at the office.  It is also a wonderful aid in helping us relax before going to sleep.  The colors are truly stunning and the video is sharp and crystal clear.  It makes you feel as though you are really there. I highly recommend this video to everyone!!! This virtual vacation to the Rockies will leave you feeling refreshed, rejuvenated and peaceful from this wonderful experience with nature. I plan to give them as gifts!",1297382400,4,719,4.966666666666667
8430949,5,B004IMZJJI,What beautiful places this video has.  I loved the way the music goes so well with the scenery.  Very relaxing to watch and to meditate.  Would love to see some of those places someday!,1289692800,2,185,4.382352941176471
8430950,5,B004IMZJJI,"I cannot express enough how incredibly celestial this DVD was for me and how it changed my life.  I had gone through a breakup, major clinical depression and the demise of a career that I spent most of my life in as an entertainer.  No therapist or psychiatrist could ameliorate the anxiety this soul experienced until I purchased this DVD.  My stress level is at a minimum and I no longer need pills to help me sleep.  EVEN MY HIGH STRUNG PITBULL MIX calms down when we fall asleep to the visuals and the music.  It it sheer serendipity.  I recommend it to everyone.",1289692800,9,567,4.403846153846154
