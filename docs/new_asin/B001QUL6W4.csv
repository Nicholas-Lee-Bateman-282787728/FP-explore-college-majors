The orquestal direction by Cobos is excellent. The musicality of both Domingo and Martinez is impressive.  Not to mention the vivid colors, camera panning and superb high fidelity both in audio & video with this Blu-ray version.  I strongly recommend this concert even for the non classical fans.",1278979200,,431,4.797297297297297

3770938,5,B001QUL6W4,"The mature voice of Placido Domingo is the perfect frame to the work of art soprano voice of Ana Maria Martinez, in the best selections of Spanish Zarzuela, not forgetting the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg accompanienment. Bravo, bravo y bravisimo!!!",1261958400,2,252,5.325
3770939,5,B001QUL6W4,"Other than his virtuosity as a lyric tenor, Placido exhibits at large his innate attributes of Spanish singer; surely the mark of his parents Placido and Pepita Embil both zarzuela singers. The adorable presence and voice of Ana Maria Martnez, so natural and versatile in her expression, and with those sweet and clean altos, make of her the perfect mate to Placido in this style. The conductor Lpez-Cobos succeeds in drawing the spirit and rythm of zarzuela from the fine Mozarteum Orchestra. Though I missed some emblematic zarzuelas like Los Gavilanes and La Leyenda del Beso, this DVD is the most enjoyable fiesta madrilea.",1261872000,3,627,5.038461538461538
3770940,5,B001QUL6W4,This among my ten favourites concerts one of the most importants. Placido Domingo and his protge Ana Maria Martinez offers a unique concert that have to be in all the shelves of people that love quality and performance. Ana Maria is at the level that Placido requires,1259280000,,267,4.702127659574468
3770941,5,B001QUL6W4,"Wondering if this is worth the price, since it is a little higher than that of the usual Blu-ray or DVD? Oh, yes. Every penny.

The 1080i Blu-ray picture (in 16:9 format, filling the entire HD TV screen) is stunning. You can even see the veins under Ana Maria Martinez's porcelain skin. If you're thinking that perhaps this indicates there's TOO much detail and you'd rather go for the lower-resolution DVD, think again. All that fine detail the Blu-ray provides helps produce a picture that is incredibly lifelike.

Combine that with the crystal-clear, open sound that the Blu-ray distributes to all speakers and you have an immersive experience. It feels like you are there in the theater -- but better, with close-ups. I was mesmerized and engaged in a way I haven't been outside of a live performance. And by owning this Blu-ray, I can experience it again and again for only a small fraction of the price paid by those in the audience. (By the way, before viewing the concert be sure to go to the settings in the Blu-ray menu to change the audio from the default -- PCM stereo -- to PCM 5.1, if you have a home theater setup. It makes all the difference.)

But superior picture quality and sound would be for naught if the performance being captured weren't worthy. This one is.

What can one say about Placido Domingo? It boggles the mind to think he's been singing for about half a century. He's truly a wonder of the opera world. His tenor voice may sound more baritonal than ever, but it's fully intact, and his artistry is at its peak. Long may he live and provide us with pleasure through his singing.

Ana Maria Martinez was a revelation to me, and you're hearing this from someone who thinks great singers are few and far between nowadays. This Puerto Rican soprano has a gorgeous voice with a rock-solid technique that makes her exquisite singing seem effortless.

The Mozarteum Orchester Salzburg, an Austrian orchestra here playing outside its usual repertoire, does a beautiful job under the baton of veteran Spanish conductor Jesus Lopez Cobos.",1250380800,19,2061,4.727019498607242
3770942,5,B001QUL6W4,"What can you say about Placido Domingo and Ana Maria Martinez. Individually, they are great but together... they are on fire!
Zarzuela is such a nice music form. Too bad it is not more popular in the US.
The orchestra was incredible and the recording was exellent.
The blue Ray version is great. The colors are so vibrant and the sound is crisp.
If you like zarzuela you will love this. If you don't like Zarzuela... you will love it after seing this Blue Ray DVD.

Un beso a mi prima Ana y a Placido por tan buen regalo musical para todos nosotros.

I'll Be waiting for the next Domingo- Martinez DVD!

3770943,5,B001QUL6W4,"Short and sweet: this is a sensational disc. If you enjoy the human voice, you can't not love this concert. The orchestra was a match for the singing and watching the conductor silently sing along brought back memories of Toscanini singing aloud on some of his opera recordings.
Video and audio outstanding. Bravo!",1240704000,8,314,4.943396226415095
3770944,5,B001QUL6W4,"I can not say enough about this performance of Zarzuela music.  The soprano (Ana Maria Martinez), the tenor (Placido Domingo) and the director (Jesus Lopez Cobos) are all at the top of music world and performed with much gusto and flair.",1240617600,3,237,4.780487804878049
3770945,5,B001QUL6W4,"A delightful concert given by the best of the best. Zarzuelas never caught too much outside Spain. Domingo is doing his best to expose to the rest of the world this slightly different form of opera/operetta. The melodies in this Blu-Ray are well chosen and beautiful. There is no doubt that Domingo, Martinez and Lopez Cobos really enjoy performing in this concert. The audience also seems to like it, but.. at the end the performers have to please their audiences, so the last encore is a known melody from the Marry Widow sung in German.
The imagery and sound are perfect. In summary, a great concert to enjoy and get exposed to great Zarzuela melodies.
I am still waiting for great full Zarzuela productions on DVD and Blu-Ray available in the US.  Luisa Fernanda is one of them, not surprisingly with Domingo in the cast.
Highly recommended.",1240444800,18,845,4.7482993197278915
8336408,5,B001QUL6W4,"We have known Ana Maria since she was six years old so it is no wonder that we follow her career with enthusiasm filled with love.  But, we forget that when we listen to her singing.  We are as critical as with any other singer.  This is a video that makes us proud and you will feel the love, too.  She, and Placido, are remarkable.  It will be difficult, if not impossible, to find a better program of zarzuelas than this video.  The selections are perfect and the executions are without fault.  We recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to hear great music performed by the best interpreters alive today.  The very best is at hand!",1490140800,,634,4.358974358974359
8336409,5,B001QUL6W4,"Placido Domingo and Ana Maria Martinez create one of the most memorable live concerts in recent memory. A couple duets, but mainly alternating solos of zarzuelas (light operatic Spanish or Mexican love songs) but they bring the passion and vocal mastery of high opera to the zarzuela form. I've heard Domingo sing the male versions of these songs many times before, live and in recording, and I know they tap into a deep part of his DNA--sense memories of his father singing in his youth, fond thoughts about his childhood, etc., which evoke a special passion in his voice--but Martinez was a discovery for me personally (though since then, and because of this performance, I've bought and listened to everything she has ever recorded, precious little as it is). She doesn't just sing the notes, she sings the music, the feelings, the ideas, the meanings, the tones--the emotional swoops, dives, and leaps--and turns in one of the most remarkable performances I've ever had the pleasure to hear on disk. (And at this point, I've watched and listened to this particular performance at least a dozen times.) She doesn't sing a single line the same, a single phrase mechanically, or merely ""accurately"" and ""musically."" Every phrase is infused with freshly felt and original emotion. Highly, highly, highly recommended. Music, singing, expression, emotion doesn't get better than this, on both singers' parts, but Martinez is the star of stars, the great expressor of expressers here. Oh, before I forget: to pay credit where credit is due: Conductor Jesus Lopez-Cobos makes a deserving third, getting even the Salzburg orchestra to sound Spanish!",1464220800,,1644,5.115241635687732
8336410,5,B001QUL6W4,"You don't need me to tell you that Placido owns Zarzuelas, the Cinderella of Opera. We watched with delight. The choice of material was excellent and the quality of Blu Ray: better than being there.",1431993600,,198,4.685714285714286

8336412,5,B001QUL6W4,"These zarzuela excerpts are all delightful.  Placido Domingo has the heritage, musicality, and voice that are unsurpassed for singing zarzuelas.  Many of his songs are from the zarzuela Luisa Fernandez which he has recorded on another DVD.  Ana Maria Martinez also is a wonderful singer who truly is ""de Espana vengo"" as her song says.  Jesus Lopez Cobos conducts the Spanish sounding Austrian orchestra.",1385078400,,404,5.265625
8336413,5,B001QUL6W4,A gift for a friend who knew what a real Zarzuela should sound like. I heard a live performance in Spain. This seemed scrubbed but my friend said it was OK. Enough said.,1374192000,,169,4.151515151515151
8336414,5,B001QUL6W4,"This concert from the 2007 Salzburg Festival features some significant connections which may also have contributed to the success of the evening. Placido Domingo was brought up steeped in the zarzuela tradition in so far as his parents had their own zarzuela company in Mexico. Ana Maria Martinez is also linked externally to this concert in so far as she was a protg of one of Domingo's own singing competitions and is now a regular singing partner with Domingo as on this night captured here. She has also been featured in an earlier EuroArts release with Domingo - the Spanish Night concert with the Berlin Philharmonic.

Bearing in mind the accepted worldwide opinion of Domingo's vocal qualities and the likelihood that he would only choose to sing regularly in concert with someone of whom he highly approves as described above, I think it can be taken as read that the quality of the singing on this disc is of a very high order. This is especially true as it involves music with which he has had a lifetime association and dating back to his parent's generation.

Zarzuela is an art form which originated in Madrid and there is still a zarzuela theatre in Madrid today. The entertainment format consists of song, dance and speech and is traditionally centred on subjects topical of the day. It could include popular songs and dances added on as felt appropriate.

One of the most successful zarzuela composers was Torroba and his most successful zarzuela was Luisa Fernanda. Naturally therefore, this concert features a generous selection of Torroba's output including selections from Luisa Fernando. Other composers featured are Chueca, Carn, Serrano, Otero, Bellido, Penella, Sorozabl, Chapi, Lecuona and finally Lhar whose `Lippen schweigen' from the Merry Widow makes for a very popular, but non-zarzuela, final encore. The orchestra play two popular items by de Falla, the Ritual Dance from El Amor Brujo and Jota from The Three Cornered Hat, to break up the constant flow of vocal pieces.

The format throughout the concert is typical of this sort of occasion with each singer taking it in turns on the stage, plus some duets and with a couple of purely orchestral items as mentioned above. The conductor is very much a Spanish specialist being Jsus Lpez Cobos and who infuses the excellent orchestra with Spanish brio and provides superb accompaniment for the two singers.

The camera work is excellently crisp and captures the event admirably. Colours are full and faithfully presented and the sound is equally faithfully presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo.

This is an excellent disc and is currently a unique example of this type of zarzuela-based concert. The audience loved it and so should any purchasers of the disc. For these reasons it seems only correct to suggest a full 5 star rating for this recording.",1349827200,4,2827,4.966173361522198
8336415,5,B001QUL6W4,"This is a wonderful music video featuring excerpts from Zarzuelas (Spainsh Folk Operas) made in Salsburg, Austria in 2007.

Placido Domingo is remarkable as always. He grew up singing this type of music with his parents, so it's in his DNA. And every number he sings shows his passion and involvement with the genre.  His partner, is the elegant, lovely young soprano, Ana Maria Martinez, from Puerto Rico. A Julliard trained singer with a Masters in Music she is every bit the professional. Her style and ease in this music is very natural.  What a beautiful voice and vocal technique. She and Placido make great partners. As the video shows, both obviously enjoyed themselves very much.

The setting for the concert is ideal and the ""house"" is full, which is to be expected. The final encore of the evening will surprise you, as it did the audience!

This is a video that all classical music lovers should have. You'll play it over and over again.  I have already given it as a gift to friends!!

I grew up in my hometown Caracas,Venezuela which was visted  at least once a year  by a spanish zarzuela company.
It  was  through Zarzuela that I become a classical music lover and also  a singer.
I was delighted by this concert  last night. It has a special mixture between well known zarzuela arias  and others  equally beautifull but less known.
The selection is  outstanding!!...The performance superb...
I highly recomend this concert as a  treasure for those who love spanish classical music ...it will be a concert you will watch more than twice and for those who like me have been listening and enjoyed zarzuela for long  will be  a  wonderfull date  with  magical music that will bring back good memories!!",1291334400,,795,4.693430656934306
