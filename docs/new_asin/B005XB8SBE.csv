4902832,5,B005XB8SBE,"""Princess Resurrection"" is an anime that I found surprisingly engrossing considering it has been completely unheralded. I ran into it by coincidence while searching for obscure vampire titles and it was just about love at first sight.  For a show that seems to utilize nearly every anime convention imaginable, this one still manages to feel fresh by combining elements from all sorts of genres within the genre. The primary setting for the show is classic horror with broad swaths of comedy and it reminds me a lot of Buffy The Vampire Slayer in it's approach. It's got the ""monster of the week"", a metric ton of homages for classic horror/sci-fi fans (including, of course, the Lovecraft incantation I used for the title of this review), recognizable archetypes that are allowed to revel in their roles to the point of parody, and a pretty bizarre sense of humor to tie it all together. This may not have gone over big with the masses, but it feels like it was made with me in mind.

Every good anime (or any work of fiction, really) thrives one one thing above all else: characters. ""Princess Resurrection"" is a show that is acutely aware of this fact. While the limited cast of the first few episodes leads to a slow start, Princess Hime of the Monster Kingdom soon begins building her femme fatale dream team of supernatural servants and allies and ends up with the usual ragtag group of lovably caustic personalities interacting with each other. Hime herself is a mythological creature, but revealing which one is a spoiler although you will likely smack yourself in the head for not realizing it sooner once it's revealed. She has the ability to resurrect the dead to be her faithful servants using her Flame of Life. It is the fate of all potential royal heirs to do away with each of their siblings before one can ascend to the throne and although our heroine has no interest in becoming Queen, she still lives under constant covert attack from members of her family. Her haughty reptilian gaze and cold mannerisms hide a kind and merciful woman with a passion for medieval weaponry, chainsaws, and general carnage. Flandre is her robotic pint-sized guardian who speaks only using the word ""huga"" and looks more then a little funny in her little maid outfit with her mouth wide open in a perpetually surprised expression. Hiro is an unlucky boy granted the Flame of Life who becomes the first new subject drafted into Hime's service. He requires her Flame regularly to maintain his immortality and is immune to death so long as he receives it. Maybe he would have been better off dead when the alternative is eternal abuse at the hands of a harem of ill-tempered female supernatural creatures.

Along the way two more primary characters show up to make the show really cook. First, Liza, the half-werewolf who can only semi-transform (usually her arms), but makes up for it with pure fighting spirit. She's the typical tomboyish loudmouth character. For contrast, the vampire high school idol Reiri comes in initially to drink Hime's blood. But being defeated, she withdraws but remains a part of their lives for the show's duration. Her capricious and demure mannerisms coupled with her scorching wit make her the most entertaining character by far. It doesn't hurt that she seems to have her own agenda as well. Whether she seeks friendship, another shot at Hime's blood, romance with Hiro (or Hime), just wants to be entertained by the struggles and antics, or all of the above is not really made concrete for most for the show and I like it like that. Plus, any vampire that actually lives in an abandoned church is just damn cool. It's also worth noting that Liza and Reiri HATE each other with the vamp typically getting the better of their exchanges. There are many more characters, but this is the primary cast.

Okay. Characters: check. What else is there to love? I haven't even gotten started. Mermen, mummies, shapeshifters, an invisible man, spider-bats, triffids, headless horseman, the entire vampire race, a slasher film reject, a ghost ship, a vain witch with an unhinged laugh and goblin servants, an inept tanuki vampire hunter, a catgirl assassin, and some original surprises are just a few of the foes to be taken on before the anime's premature conclusion. Hiro will be pierced, slashed, hit by vehicles, drowned, and vamped among many other demises along the way. He's like an anime Kenny from South Park. Oh yes, and the satire. While ""Princess Resurrection"" utilizes several standard anime devices, it occasionally takes the time to mock itself and it's own fans. One character happens upon the lead character combo and politely inquires what kind of cosplay they are doing. That is some funny stuff. Taking the premise even further, they stage an episode where a group of Hiro's classmates invade the mansion (word to the wise; stay away from the creepy mansion at the top of the hill with a constant vortex of clouds over it) and each fall head-over-heels for their favorite anime-girl fantasy. One goes ga-ga for Hiro's ridiculously chesty and naive sister -who works as Hime's live in maid- and constantly makes groping gestures and repeats ""squishy squishy"". Another admires the Amazonian warrior type and falls for Liza. The third is a shameless masochist who wishes to be dominated and treated poorly by the princess herself, who stomps on his face and then demands Flandre bring her a new unsoiled pair of shoes. It's his dream come true. Thankfully, Reiri wasn't around so I didn't have to suffer an animated version of me making girlish ""squee!"" noises every time the vampire girl was onscreen. They also missed a chance for more laughs by neglecting to point out that Hime's little sister, Sherwood, is the classic loli archetype, which is disturbingly popular among otaku. But then again this particular anime's only real weakness is that it often seems to pull punches on anything potentially offensive, which is both too bad and very odd considering the brazenly salacious closing credits. Speaking of which: the opening and closing credits are both very entertaining and amusing in and of themselves.

Now, this show was well on it's way to five star status before the climax. But when Hime's elder brother unleashed the ultimate biological weapon known to horror fans upon her town (and if you don't know what that is, shame on you!), the show closed the deal. But on top of that, there are two bonus standalone episodes that I wish they had put sequentially before the climax because after building up and concluding the story arc that impressively, ending with a few throwaway eps -although very entertaining ones- kind of dampened the ending a bit. Still, this is a show I've enjoyed more then almost any anime in recent memory (and that is a lot of anime). This definitely turned out to be a big sleeper hit for me. Sadly, getting a second season of a show like this one is even less dependable in Japan then it is in America so it appears ""Princess Resurrection"" is doomed to be incomplete as an anime story. But then again, with animated series, there is always hope of it being picked up again down the line. And there's always the manga if you aren't retarded like me and get a headache reading right-to-left. Check this series out if you're a horror fanatic and pray with me for another season.",1326758400,15,7353,4.8186856690419635
4902833,5,B005XB8SBE,"I stumbled on this anime last year Halloween, while I was going thru the list of anime titles on the website that I was watching the other animes on.  Princess Resurrection was very interesting and it sets the mood for Halloween. The story is about a young boy who becomes a servant and also a protector of the Princess of all monsters, when he pushes her out of the way from falling iron-beams from a construction site.  The Princess feels that no mere human would stand up to her standards of what kindness would do.  But instead, in his dying words, the young boy was glad to see the Princess was not injured and this made her realized that there is value that this young boy has.  Together with along other friends of the Princess later on in the series, go up against other monsters and also testing each others loyalties as well.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

Princess Resurrection ('''' Kaibutsu 'jo?, lit. Monster Princess) is a supernatural, Horror, Comedy and Action manga by Yasunori Mitsunaga. The manga is serialized monthly in Monthly Sh'nen Sirius magazine and published by Kodansha. An 26 episode anime series by Madhouse aired on TBS in 2007. Both the manga and anime are available in North America with the manga licensed by Del Rey Manga and the anime licensed by Sentai Filmworks and available on the Anime Network website. A new OVA series has been made by Tatsunoko Production with the first episode released in December 2010, along with the 13th volume of the manga and the second episode for the 14th volume.

Plot

Main article: List of Princess Resurrection characters

Hiro Hiyorimi is a boy who has just moved to the city to meet his sister. While walking down the sidewalk, he is suddenly hit by a car (crushed by construction beams in the anime). On the verge of death, he is seen by a young woman clad in gothic clothes. She then resurrects him, leaving him alive in the hospital morgue. He wakes up confused over what happened, only to encounter the woman again as she eliminates some wolf creatures. She addresses Hiro as ""her servant"" and introduces herself as ""Hime"" (Japanese for Princess) and explains that she is a member of the royal family of the Monster Realm.

All members of the royal family are endowed with the power to turn a dead body into an immortal warrior that will serve and protect them; this means that a corpse that drinks her blood (or to whom she bestows the flame of immortality in the anime) shall become semi-immortal; this is how Hiro came back to life. They can't be killed, even if their heads are severed; it can be reattached, and appendages can eventually regrow. The ""semi"" means that if Hiro doesn't drink more of Hime's blood (or she replenishes the flame in the anime) every few days, he will die permanently

Hiro is now Hime's immortal warrior, but she herself isn't immortal yet (which is why she needs help from warriors). The story then follows Hiro as he assists Hime in killing creatures that have been sent by her siblings to attack her in the competition for the Monster Kingdom's throne.

Anime

A 26 episode anime directed by Masayuki Sakoi and Madhouse aired on TBS, BS-i, KBS Kyoto and its affiliated TV networks from 13 April 2007 to 28 September 2007. Unlike the manga, the anime is less violent and the gore has been toned down. The Opening Theme song was ""BLOOD QUEEN"" by Aki Misato and the Ending Theme song was ""Bow Down and Lick My Feet"" ('''''''', hizamazuite ashi wo oname) by Ali Project. The official soundtrack of the anime series is Princess Resurrection OST - Sympathy for the Belonephobia, that is released on October 3, 2007.",1323993600,3,3044,4.672897196261682

4902836,4,B005XB8SBE,"First off let me start this off by saying I have not read any of the manga for this series so I can't compare the two at all. All i can tell you is about the anime itself.

Well without any serious spoilers, (everything I am about to say happens in episode one.) We meet a boy named Hiro who seems like you're every day guy until he suddenly dies from being impaled by a steel beam. Oh did I mention he pushed the princess of the series out of the way, yeah that's important. Anyway Hiro saves her life by pushing her out of the way and he dies. The Princess (Hime) Brings him back to life as her royal servant with an ability known as the flame of life. This grants Hiro immortality as long as Hime is around, which binds the two together, master and servant.

From there each episode is more or less a stand alone, some sort of creature or monster is after Hime for the power she has and through all this we have to see Hiro and his friends do the best job they can to protect her. There is a major plot spread out throughout the series but it doesn't really go into major detail in it until the last few episodes which I found a little disappointing.

Throughout the story you're going to meet a cast of wonderful characters each with their own unique personality. All the way from a werewolf to a vampire it's very fun and entertaining to watch these characters interact with each other, the dialogue is fantastic and so is the development of the characters. In many of the shows I watch I don't really care what always happens to the characters, I am more along for the plot, but in this series I truly found myself caring what happened to them.

It's a great series to get into and I don't think you will be disappointed. The only issue I had with it, which I mentioned above, is the lack of serious moving plot until the very end, other than that the series is great.

One thing I must note, there are 26 episodes in the series, but the last two almost feel like fillers, they don't really go with the pace of the show. When you reach episode 24 it feels the series is over and it ends on a strong note, and sort of a cliff hanger. But then you have two episodes left which really have nothing to do with the plot.

If you are a fan of demons, werewolf, vampires, and just the underworld in general, don't let this one slip by.",1306108800,2,2334,4.1755555555555555

4902847,3,B005XB8SBE,"I bought this not really knowing more than what was on the back of the box.

First off, while at first glance it may look like a typical harem anime, this is actually an action series.  The action is pretty well done with fluid animation.

Princess Resurrection lacks a main story.  It regularly alludes that the Princess is in a fight to the death with her siblings, but rarely bothers do anything with it except use it as an excuse to setup an episode's disposable antagonist.  Episodes tend to be a formulaic: monster shows up, one of the characters gets in trouble, the Princess shows up to save the day.  Occasionally, they mix things up.

The characters themselves while creative, are a bit flat with their personalities.  It does not help that there is no real character development or progression.

A lot of the writing fell flat for me.  The drama isn't built up enough to have any real emotional impact.  Most of the humor tends to be dry.  Though, when the action really heats up, the show shines.

In the end, Princess Resurrection never gets dull enough for you to turn off, but it never really gets good enough to get worked up over.",1364169600,,1147,4.536585365853658
4902848,5,B005XB8SBE,I saw it on Youtube. I like this anime. It took me little awhile to understand the story.  It's about a boy still in school. He was going to his new home. He has only his sister and himself. He push this lady away from this falling object and was killed. Then his whole life change this Anime is worth buying. The story and artwork was good.,1362787200,,341,4.08955223880597
4902849,5,B005XB8SBE,"This series is Awesome, but I had a couple of thorns form it. Too much time spent on character introduction and not enough time spent on story/plot progression. This could be due to the fact that there is another season somewhere. This series moved along to fast near the end, but then it wouoldn't be a bad thing if you could pop in another series to finish it up. What? there's more? Yes, this leaves you hanging in mid air expecting more. However, very well done, love the story, the characters, perspective, and fresh ideas. Has zombies, werewolves, ghosts, demons, vampires and other creatures of shadows. This series is worth having and watching again.",1355097600,,658,4.780701754385965
4902850,3,B005XB8SBE,"Since Hiro's parents died, he has lived apart from his big sister, Sawawa. She sends him a letter inviting him to come stay with her. She has a new job as caretaker of a mansion. The mansion is the home of the Princess, Hime. She is an immortal that has the power to grant partial immortality to those who have died. On his way to the mansion, Hiro saves Hime from being crushed by steel beams. He is killed, but Hime brings him back to life and employs him as her servant. Living with a royal princess that is also an immortal, a super gorgeous yet clueless sister, a sexy vampire, a go for broke werewolf babe, and Hime's clingy little sister with a stuck up crush on him; life for Hiro is gonna be crazy. It's a good thing he's immortal now; cause he would be dead 100 times over by the end of the story.

This anime is fun, funny, and light hearted. There is a good mix of comedy, action, and drama. The problem with this show is that it doesn't really develop a serious story. Anime doesn't need a serious story to be extremely entertaining, but to make up for not being serious, it needs to be very funny or fast paced. Princess Resurrection is not extremely funny or fast paced. It has pretty good animation, voice acting, and a descent soundtrack. There are also several pretty cool characters. It's just that this series isn't exceptional in any aspect. Princess Resurrection is average all the way across the board. It's a shame too.

4902852,4,B005XB8SBE,"This was another impulse anime. I knew nothing about it until popping it into the 'ol ps3 to watch. The premise is alright and sets up the show for the various scenarios within each episode. There is not much character development beyond the basic story of each character. Just enough to explain why they are there, pretty much. It does have some nice moments scattered throughout, but also has a few generic moments as well. My favorite parts are actually the interplay between the Vampire, Reiri and the Princess, Hime. The shop owner and Sawawa are great too. It has a few good battles also. Overall the series doesn't really go anywhere to deep or follow a serious story arc consistently, although it does have a build up toward the end. It is basically a slice of life ... for monsters. Some may love it, I liked it, others may just dismiss it entirely. It is worth watching and I don't regret picking it up. If you are a fan of monsters you should definitely like it though. If they did ever come out with another season (doubtful) I would watch it to see the story continue.",1351641600,,1081,4.49238578680203

The thing that kills it is that they chopped so many of the good parts out that this is jest a very bad anime now, if you wait to see what I mean get the One from Japan an compare the two. You will see there is a part with two of the main characters were the resurrected male grabs the pow of the Half she-wolf and says ""Your so soft and fluffy!"" in the middle of a battle that throws her game off making her turn all shy and girly for two secs tell she throws him in to a tree (This is the mini reason she joins He-ma) .

4902855,5,B005XB8SBE,"I will say wasn't really sure what to expect when i got this series since i didn't check it out on the web before i purchased it. It just sounded like something i would like so got it and hafta say its 1 of the best series for its guandra. It does start off a bit slow but by time u get a few episodes into the series it really picks up and once all the major players are intrduced it really gets good.
Yes this is a stand alone episode series wich i personaly tend to like hate it when they wanna drag a series out for 15 or 20 years like what they did with Bleach.
Also i will add it does have a english DUB wich i was worried abouot cause after i started checkin out some other sites they were saying it needed dub and wasn't in english. By the way i reconised most of the english voice actores/actresses and they did a excelant job. Hell Monica Rai ( wich is one of my favs) was 1 of the actresses so if your familar with her work u no what to expect.
Also at the end of the series it just doesnt leave u hanging they do a good job of tieing things up with with the main antaganist and our group. They also left it so they could continue with the series if the wanted to make a season 2 (  heres hopeing for that one day)
So if u like shows like Hellsing, Trinity Blood, Black Bloodbrothers ect u will most likely enjoy this series. Its not as violent as Hellsing ect but has a very good story and chars that ya really can get into and start likeing. Also love the constant bickering between Liza or Risa as the japs say and Rei Rei its halarious. I kinda felt more sorry for Liza than any one else since everyone rips on her and treats her like she a dog only because she half werewolf. So if u like shows like this or Night Gallery/Twilight Zone try this out u won't be disapointed. Oh by the way this series is set up the was Night Gallery/Twilight Zone was made so if your familar with those 2 shows u will no what to expect from this.
If u like all the classic monsters from western culture then by all means check this out you won't be sorry. Just amazing this didn't get more reconition than it did.",1331510400,,2110,4.0
