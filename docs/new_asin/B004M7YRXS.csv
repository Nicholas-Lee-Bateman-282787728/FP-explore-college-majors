dir Jeff Hare, Thailand & USA, 2009

Formulaic romantic comedy 3.5*

Brian (Kip Pardue) is a jet-setting coffee buyer for a St*rb*cks like chain, whose boss Calvert Jenkins (James Brolin) orders him to Thailand in spite of his objections (they only grow the inferior robusta beans! ).  On arrival he is waylaid by the two beautiful young women, modern Bangkok fashion executive Ticha (Napakpapha Nakprasitte) and her coffee expert friend Mook (Kalorin Supaluck Neemayothin), and Mook's expat boyfriend Werner (Spencer Garrett), and persuaded to visit Ticha's home village to sample their coffee.  Sparks fly between Brian and Ticha (seriously, folks, I expected to see some pigtails dipped in the inkwell here!)  -- or is it attraction, in spite of her forswearance of men for professional advancement and his impending marriage to the rich, pleasant, beautiful Amanda (Laura Sorenson)? Will the village get the coffee contract?

Ups and downs and twists abound, and there are some definite points of interest:  The real reason for Calvert's interest in Thailand caught me by surprise.  Pakkaramai Potranan is a scene stealing relief as Ticha's tomboy younger sister Mint.  Amanda's character, in her brief exposure, has some surprising depth.

So why am I not enthusiastic about this one?  Partly, it's just too beautiful, too 'perfect'.  The beautiful Thai scenery, cities and villages and deserted swimming holes, seem crafted by a tourist bureau.  The music  is too relentlessly bouncy (and grating to my ear).  The two lead women (Ticha and Mook) are too ""actress-model"" beautiful, Brian too aw-shucks hunky, even the aging Calvert and the seedy Werner are too prettified.  And with very minor exceptions, everyone is too relentlessly nice, even the hard charging Brian cares for the villagers and wouldn't dream of driving a hard bargain.  The frequent snippets of coffee lore seem tacked on for display (Brian challenges Ticha and Mook to a test before agreeing to go to their village) rather than integrated into the story as wine lore is in Sideways.

Not a bad movie, and it may suit your mood for the evening.  Plenty of eye candy, male, female and inanimate. If relentlessly sweet is your gig, the fairy story plot may leave you with a warm feeling in the end.  I found it hard to take seriously though, even in a light way.  I wonder how it plays in Thailand?",1308096000,11,2387,5.022900763358779
4428774,1,B004M7YRXS,"Yikes, I can not believe the other reviews - this movie was pretty terrible except for James Brolin who hardly appears in the movie.  I found myself cringing when certain actors were about to speak.  Silly script, consistent overacting by most of the actors, mood-breaking happy-a$$ music - truly a B grade movie. For those who enjoy lampooning such things - you may enjoy it for that reason but stay away otherwise.

On the positive side, the Thai scenery was pretty and the opening credit scene of coffee being made was beautifully done.",1308009600,2,539,4.774193548387097

I actually chose this looking forward to seeing something of Thai culture and in this area I was not disappointed. Beautiful scenery. Yes, the storyline was a bit predictable but it was nice.

4428878,3,B004M7YRXS,Corny romance that didn't explore the characters. A romance without depth.,1406505600,,74,5.818181818181818
4428879,2,B004M7YRXS,"Acting was good when actors were speaking in their native language but tinny when speaking in English but main thing was whole story just seemed to drag. It was good premise and we saw ""End of The Line"" which is similar story line and it was much better and moved along with even pace and good acting.

We just could not finish ""Bitter/Sweet"" as it was far more bitter than sweet. Will ask for refund on this one.
Watch ""The End of The Line"" for similar story line but MUCH better movie over all!",1406160000,4,496,4.276595744680851

4428891,3,B004M7YRXS,"Upbeat sweet kind of silly love story set in Thailand. Some ridiculous stereotypes and predictability. The star is the landscape and the beauty of Thailand. If you like veg out love stories and do not mind reading a few subtittles (most of it is in English) you will enjoy. I loved the contrast from the modern city to the country.

The plot is girl meets boy, boy has fiance, boy saves girls family, big tycoon has personal reasons for finacing boy saving girl so pulls out. Boy falls for girl and tycoon resurects his bullheadness, boy and tycoon save the village,  and boy gets girl.

 Napakpapha Nakprasitte better known as Mamee is a Thai actress of stunning beauty. I look forward to seeing her in Largo Winch 2.

 There is a drunk side kick, a bestie, a mom and dad that do not speak English and act silly, there is also a sister and a long lost son. Oh did I mention the villager in the statue of Liberty costume ? No one escapes stereo type not even the coffee...
If you are looking for deep intellectual fodder, go elsewhere. If you want a silly romantic comedy set in Thailand to be entertained and escape, if you find comfort in the predictable plot in a beautiful place with very beautiful humans it is for you.",1399334400,,1224,4.417777777777777

4428895,5,B004M7YRXS,"A well made feel good story that makes a person want to be young again. If someone doesn't fall in love with these beautiful Thai actresses, they don't have a heart. Most of the characters are in the coffee business, and the story is about American coffee buyers buying Thai coffee. The Thai scenery is beautiful. Indie movies have great stories and it's the next best thing to being there.",1336003200,,390,4.585714285714285
4428896,5,B004M7YRXS,"This is sweet, romantic movie about a coffee buyer who travels to Thailand on business and falls for his travel guide.  Complications arise when the company owner backs out of deals made to growers, including the guide's family.  The buyer's problems worsen when his fiance travels to Thailand and he must decide what direction his life will take.  Relationships between family and friends add color to the story.

Bottom line is, a movie is only as good as its acting.  And you must like the characters in it to like it.  This movie is a winner in both regards.  It has a great cast portraying very likeable characters.  It is also relaxing seeing the beautiful scenery of Thailand.

My only criticisms are for the opening song and the DVD cover art.  Normally, I would give 4 stars to a movie of this quality.  However, it's rare to find a romantic movie as good as this.  So I rate it 5 stars.",1331337600,18,896,4.496894409937888
