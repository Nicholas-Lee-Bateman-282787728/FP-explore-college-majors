2593826,5,B000FZETRU,"I only wish they had released it in anamorphic widescreen as the episodes were apparently already produced optimized for 16:9 displays. The recent release of JLU was finally done this way, and I hope Season 3 of TT will follow suit.",1163808000,,232,4.682926829268292
2593827,4,B000FZETRU,"This DVD of Teen titans the 2nd seasion has a good story plot, and I for one love it!  It has a very good ending and it teaches what true frendship is all about, and its quite tuching!",1163116800,,184,3.8421052631578947
2593828,4,B000FZETRU,"I thought they would make a separate DVD with the rest of the second season on there (to follow up ""Volume 1: Fear Itself""), but it seems they finally came to their senses and did the whole second season on a 2-disc box set.

However, if they DID make a Season 2, Volume 2, I would put down the following:

""The next seven episodes feature the return ('Titan Rising'), the betrayal ('Betrayal'), and the wrath ('Aftershock', both parts) of the earth-moving Titan named Terra.  She was a good girl, though.

Also, the second half of the second season has two of the LOONIEST episodes you've ever laid eyes on !  One is called 'Transformation' where Starfire turns into a hideous, yet hilarious creature.  The other, 'Fractured', is a really zany romp starring an interdimensional weirdo named Larry (aka Nosyarg Kcid).  Thanks to Larry and his reality-altering powers, he's turned the Titans' world upside-down, inside-out, and even backwards !""

If you want a run-down of the first six episodes, check out my review of the ""Fear Itself"" DVD.

Back to the two-disc, it has all thirteen episodes of the second season in its entirety plus the featurette ""Catching Up with... Teen Titans"".  This feature is a reflective look of season two in the Titans' perspective.

I wonder when the third season of ""Titans"" is coming out ?",1158192000,11,1322,4.8053097345132745
2593829,5,B000FZETRU,"Note: I have only seen this on Cartoon network so i cant say anything about the DVD itself.

When i first heard about Teen Titans i did everything i could to avoid watching it because im not at all into comic books and superman and all that. But when i finally watched it i was like WOW! Its funny, has a interesting story line, is sweet, has alot of action, sometimes dark, sometimes sad. Oh my gosh! people are going to start calling me a Teen Titan  fan if i go on like this! Actually the first time i watched the Terra episodes i nearly cryed although that dosnt say much coz i cry about just about every show thats kinda sad. Also it gos more into deth about the relationships between the characters. Im telling you even if your not a fan of the comic book watch this. ITS GREAT!! (Oh yeah and the great thing about Teen Titans is that you don't HAVE TO buy every episode in order)",1154649600,4,886,4.175438596491228
2593830,5,B000FZETRU,"There's not many cartoon shows I really enjoy watching.  But I plan to go into the animation field of work, and I have to say, besides the Ninja Turtles, this is the next best cartoon show.  I like the animation style, the comic relief, and the constant plot twists.  Another thing i enjoy about it, is the fact that each episode has something to do with the next one, it's ongoing, not just random stories each time.  For example, Slade was in countless, and the Trigon episodes were awesome!  And I loved Tara, i thought that made it very interesting, was she good, bad...  But I have to say that I didn't care for The Brother Blood episodes all that much.  Except the last few episodes where they fought all the bad guys.  I'm very disappointed that it was cancelled, and what was up with Tara showing up!?  Did she remember everything!?  It was very confusing...I wish they'd wrap that up better with more episodes!",1152403200,3,919,4.515151515151516
2593831,5,B000FZETRU,"This is season 2 of the Teen Titans series, and is notable for adapting the ""Judas Contract"" story arc from the comics. Terra is introduced, and Beast Boy is given something else to do other than play the comic relief. In other episodes Starfire is blasted to the future and meets Nightwing(!), Robin takes Killer Moth's daughter to the prom, and the Titans compete in a tournament of heroes and gain new allies. The obligatory ""fractured"" episode of the season is just that, with an imp named Larry breaking reality and causing chaos for everyone. The only blemish is the tail end of the season finale, which seems to take the easy way out after all the built-up character drama.

So we get another nice, compact, affordable collection of episodes. Half of this season was already released under the subtitle ""Fear Itself,"" but this is the only place to pick up the remaining 7 episodes. Since Warner Bros. doesn't seem to be releasing another single disc for those who bought the first one, the smart (only) bet would be for fans to grab this set and sell the single disc. The prices are comparable, either way.",1151280000,17,1113,4.678571428571429

2593860,5,B000FZETRU,"This show is absolutely brilliant. The show is fantastically coordinated between the elements of lightheartedness, seriousness, natural comedy, drama etc. The characters just mesh with each other so well, they're all very different but compliment each other perfectly. The story telling is great because you get a good insight into each character's development but you don't get every single question answered and there is plenty that is left up to the imagination of the viewers.

The soundtracks from the show were very good and I'd love to had the OSTs if they were available.  Also, the connections that the heroes had with the villains made the missions more personal and emotionally connective.

This season is specifically focused on a Teen Titan named Terra who actually doesn't form part of the core group of Teen Titans that are featured on all five seasons. She (Terra) has somewhat of a sad story, but it's still really interesting to see  how things unfold and how the Titans learn from everything that happens in this season. Considering the decisions that were made in the end it isn't really all that sad, but rather inspiring and redemptive in nature. I would highly recommend it.",1491782400,,1197,5.0

Each season is clean, intelligent fun. Moral choices are shown along with consequences and there is a clear good or evil differentiation. The characters look great and the stories don't lag. I like that the episodes continue the overall storyline as well.

And you can't beat the price on Amazon!

2594174,4,B000FZETRU,"""Teen Titans, The Complete Second Season"" features thirteen episodes of fun, stylish superhero adventure.  Though I'm still not a fan of the exaggerated flourishes of animation used to depict surprise or fright (exclamation points appearing over characters' heads, eyes bugging out, etc.), I've softened a little on those silly elements and just try to roll with them. Besides, the goofiness is mostly held back in the more serious episodes, especially those involving the new Titan known as Terra.

The four or so episodes centering around Terra are the best of the bunch, by the way, with the drama and danger continuously ratcheted up as the truth behind Terra is slowly but steadily revealed.  There are particularly good action sequences in these episodes, too, as the animators take advantage of Terra's unique and very visual power to move- and ride on- land masses, boulders, and multi-ton swaths of dirt.

All thirteen episodes look and sound great on standard DVD, though there really isn't much in the extras department.  ""Teen Titans"" continues to be perfectly fine for kids (the show's mostly geared to 'em, in fact) but sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy, too.  I'm onboard for the third season.",1255478400,2,1215,5.111111111111111

I bought it, and absolutely no regrets.",1224288000,,266,4.5625
2594178,5,B000FZETRU,"After Season 1 expanded on introducing the five main characters (Robin,Beast Boy, Raven, Starfire, and Cyborg) and their personalities and attitudes towards each other, it was now time for the show to take on a different storyline. The creators of the cartoon decided to take one of the biggest storylines from The New Teen Titans comic series ""Judas Contract"" and adapt it to a younger audience in the cartoon. While making the adaptation kid-friendly, the creators did not loose sight of what the ""Judas Contract"" was all about. This makes for an excellent season of Teen Titans that both comic and cartoon lovers could enjoy!

This season introduces the character of Terra Markov. In the episode 'Terra' the Teen Titans meet the geomancer and Beast Boy's love is practically instant for her when she laughs at one of his jokes (which is quite rare for the changeling). It is shown in this episode that there is an obvious connection and possible future relationship between the two. Another speculation one might point out is Slade's foreshadowing quote that ""he found her first"". This episode is the gateway for many twists and turns in the plotline of this dramatic storyline. Many emotions will be played around with and the Titans will have to face the challenge of this new member. Is the Titans new friend really what they expect? Or is there more to the character of 'Terra'?

**Key episodes in finding out what Terra's secret is are Terra,Titan Rising,Betrayal,Aftershock Part 1, and Aftershock Part 2.

Now beyond the main storyline of Season 2 which is the 'Terra Arc', are the filler episodes. Another great thing about this series is that a lot of the filler episodes are entertaining even though they don't pertain to the main arc. One of my personal favorites is 'Fear Itself"". At this point, not much is known about Raven but this episode reveals a different side to the dark character that I believe anyone can relate to. Another episode 'Transformation' which centers around Starfire and her weird Tamaranean traditions, sends a good message to kids everywhere about how one should not be judged based on their appearances.

Overall, this Season is excellent and I recommend it to any Titans fan or newcomer. With dramatic storylines like the Terra Arc, and good natured episodes like 'Transformation', both adults and kids can sit down and thouroughly enjoy this cartoon together.",1216771200,7,2401,4.965174129353234
2594179,5,B000FZETRU,"The second season of Teen Titans sees the Titans welcoming Terra and hoping to recruit her into the fold. Terra can manipulate the earth to her command & would be a welcome addition to the group but Slade has plans for her, as well. It also sees others Titans like Speedy, Aqualad, & Wildbeest making their appearance on celluloid. Like always, The show delivers fun, exciting episodes that are colorful and filled with lots of intense action. Sad thing is, other than the 'Catching up with..' segment of the two dvds, there is no extras like the first season(which was filled to the max with 'em). I agree with other reviewers out there in internetland that perhaps it's too much for us to hope for extras like this on every dvd collection but it would help & make us fans want to buy the seasons that much more. We're interested in how the process is done with cartoons, who created the characters and what plans the next season will hold...things of that nature. They could have even done a featurette(much like they did in The Batman) about the toymaking line of the franchise. At any rate; that is, perhaps, my only gripe with the season of episodes. I'm glad that Warner Brothers decided to go with selling the complete seasons than doing the volumes with only so many episodes as that was really annoying.

Again, this season was a great season and I look forward to what the next season has in store for us.

I think this is a program that will appeal to both kids & adults...it is that good.",1215820800,,1500,4.511029411764706

2594194,4,B000FZETRU,"This show is a must have for any hardcore or casual fan of DC Comics Superheroes (Batman, Robin, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lanturn, etc) as well as hardcore or casual fans of Bruce Timm's Animated Batman world. What Bruce Timm (and countless others) did for the Animated Batman, Glen Murakami did for the Teen Titans.

The plot of the season involving a girl named ""Terra"" isn't one of my favorites, but I realized that's simply because of how well they pulled you in different directions with liking and not liking her character. If you only plan on buying one or two of seasons 1-4 for the time being, I would go with 1 and 2, for chronilogical purposes.  If you've already seen every season and you're just a fan, I'd recommend 1 and 4, or 1 and 3.

The packaging and layout of the discs and episodes are straight forward. Extras are not in large amount, but there are a few small documentaries to watch which can teach you about the show, and the history of the Teen Titans, which dates back to the early 1960s.

If the buyer has never seen the show before, I recommend starting out with Season 1 in order to get to know the characters, style, structure, and overall unique presentation of the show.  However, each and every season is worth picking up for fans.  And the prices of each season are in a nice range.  The show really left a mark on intelligent and fun children's entertainment so even though it's a few years old by now, you'll still see reruns now and then.  They used to be on Cartoon Network, but if they aren't there anymore you can catch reruns very early Saturday Mornings on KidsWB if you'd like a taste.",1199404800,,1633,4.456375838926174

2594196,4,B000FZETRU,"The comics I read as a kid were filled with action, adventure and wonderful bits of humor.  Sadly, humor seems to be lacking in most of the modern animated comicbook series.  Let's face it, the only laugh you get in Batman is when Joker or Harley is around and The Flash is about the only comic relief in the Justice League.  Additionally many of those shows are really over the heads of the younger crowd or contain episodes that are disturbing to them (like Superman's death in JL, Batman's trauma over his murdered parents, etc.)

Thankfully there are the Teen Titans.  Comic book purists may not like this animated revision of the original as it deviates significantly from the comics.  But those looking for a superhero show that younger kids and parents can enjoy together Teen Titans fits the bill.  The Titan's problems are easier for younger kids to understand and there is plenty of humor for adults and kids alike.  And they manage this all without sacrificing the excitement and adventure that is central to any superhero series.",1170374400,7,1041,4.776536312849162

Just some ads for other shows as well as a sort of look-back sketch with the Titans from Season 1 through the end of Season 2.",1168560000,,322,4.209677419354839
2594198,4,B000FZETRU,"I liked teen titans ( mostly due to raven and starfire ) altho I don't care for typical super hero shows ( justice league , batman ect,ect), teen titans is a lot of laughs at a good price ,",1168473600,2,189,3.871794871794872
2594199,5,B000FZETRU,"I think that Warner finally figured out that people don't want to purchase disc after disc of just a few episodes in order to enjoy their favorite programs. This second season of Teen Titans is a must have if you are a fan of the show at all. Don't be fooled into purchasing ""Fear Itself"" (Season 2, Volume 1), as then the only way for you to purchase the second half of the season is to purchase the ENTIRE season which is included in this offering (there is no Season 2, Volume 2 offered). Our family loves Teen Titans, and we have children aged 4-24!! When our four year old son went to stay with his older married sister, his 27 year old brother-in-law begged him to bring Teen Titans along!",1168473600,12,695,4.312977099236641
2594200,5,B000FZETRU,"This season focus is on the new Titan, Terra, with insanely powerful earth powers. But Terra has a dark secret and an even darker aliance as she struggles with a troubled past and whether or not she can really betray her new friends.

It also has excelent filler episodes such as ""Fear Itself"", which is more of a Raven focus.

The season has an absolutely explosive ending, both powerful, ultra cool, and even tear-jerking. This is truly one of the shows finest accomplishments! Even if you know nothing about the first season, any kid (or teenager, like me (19)) can enjoy the anime style and the very relatable themes like maintaining control, redemption from wrong doings in the past, and the just plain funny stuff that pops up out of nowhere!",1168300800,4,748,4.702290076335878
2594201,5,B000FZETRU,"I bought this DVD set for my 4 year old daughter, who loves the Teen Titans. I cannot wait for additional ones to come out, so that we can purchase them as well. It is a DVD that adults as well as children can enjoy (over and over again). And so many episodes!

Warning: For parents of younger children, you may want to view both DVD's first to determine if any episodes are off limits to your little one (The episode ""Fear Itself"" I watched with her and I think it was a little too scary for her).

Overall a great purchase and worth every penny!",1167782400,,547,4.150943396226415

8127902,5,B000FZETRU,"This is one of my favoite Teen Titans seasons. The season is centered Terra. Is she a friend and fellow titan, or a villian who wants to destroy the do-gooders? This season's best episodes were every episode with Terra (Terra, Titan Rising, Betrayal, Aftershock Part 1, and Aftershock Part 2.) and the episodes Fractured, Winner Take All, Only Human and How Long is Forever. Bad episodes would be transformation and Every Dog Has His Day. All-in-all, a near perfect season with great episodes. Pick this up. You will be glad you did.",1520985600,,533,4.804347826086956
