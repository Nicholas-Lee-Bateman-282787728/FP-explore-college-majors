8396540,3,B003GQM1J8,"The photography is indeed beautiful. The accompanying music is serene. Using this DVD for a one hour of visual meditation is indeed calming. However, I rate a three star, ""It's okay"" because there is no option to loop the playing time so this can be an ongoing mindflo into the room.",1386720000,,283,4.568627450980392

8396542,5,B003GQM1J8,"I have enjoyed the entire MindFlo series for the past few years. I just received the latest edition (Mindflo 5) and must say that Norman Bosworth has exceeded even his own high standards with Mindflo 5!

The quality of the cinematography (in HD) is phenomenal. I feel like I have been on a journey to some very special places on our planet.  This is a DVD that will be watched again and again.

If you want to sit back and relax with a good glass of wine, this is the DVD you should be watching.  You will be amazed.  You will leave the experience with a keen appreciation of this beautiful planet we get to share.  Buy it for yourself, buy it for the people you love.  Enjoy!",1295740800,,676,4.234375
8396543,5,B003GQM1J8,"If you want to be transported to a beautiful, inspirational, and meditative place, I strongly suggest this excellent DVD. This is but one of a succession of well done works and may be
one of my favorites. The photography, as well as the music, blend perfectly to achieve just the
right mix for a magical experience that can be viewed again and again.",1295222400,,350,4.571428571428571
8396544,5,B003GQM1J8,"The cinematography, film editing and quality of all the Mindflo DVD's is exceptional. I just finished watching Mindflo 5 and it is no exception. The first part of this program is an exquisite tour of Tierra del Fuego off the tip of South America. The photography is first class the scenery is exotic and of a place that is just about inaccessible most of the year. The scenes then merge into Southern Utah and later into the snowy Rocky Mountains. This is a peaceful and relaxing journey into nature. I hope these places are still around when my grandchildren grow up. This entire series is well worth owning. Each one has its own unique feel. I would highly recommend this program to anyone that wants to just settle back and enjoy a calming tour of nature.
