7816764,5,6301925831,My favorite performer of all time. I listen to Segovia as if I was born to listen to his guitar playing; my heart skips a beat when I do. I will probably listen to his music until my end of times.... what a joy to also see him on video as well.,1431043200,,244,3.7115384615384617
7816765,5,6301925831,"This 60 minute retrospective on the maestro Andres Segovia is a delightful overview of his monumental career, including footage of the masterclasses at Santiago de Compostella (1965), snippets from the Christopher Nupin profiles, the maestro's appearance in the BBC special on the Prada, as well as testimonials by producer Israel Horwitz, guitarists Oscar Ghiglia and Eliot Fisk, and 20/20 correspondant Hugh Downs. Oh when will Kultur item 1290 on the Legacy of Segovia be available on DVD?!?!",1176768000,2,495,5.441558441558442
7816766,3,6301925831,"This video is 1 hour long. Various interviews by: his widow , friends and by students of Segovia including Eliot Fisk(who also plays Bach's ""Prelude""),10 minutes of rare master class footage,Segovia bio info from Hugh Downs and excerpts from ""The Guitar And I"" narrated by Segovia as the camera pans through the villages of Spain. Segovia plays a few pieces,mostly excerpts,but one with an orchestra. This video is something for the person that is desperate for anything having to do with Segovia. There should be more guitar playing footage to satisfy the viewer. But, all in all its worth the money.",973036800,18,601,4.96039603960396
7816767,4,6301925831,"With Segovia, you can't go wrong.  Then you asked, why did I give only a four star review instead of a perfect Five star?  It's simple, it didn't interview the passionate ""Maestro"" himself.  Instead, they have  other people talking about the Segovia, such as a young Eliot Fisk (he  studied under Segovia for awhile).  Don't misunderstand me, it's a great  video, one of my favorites in fact, but if this is going to be your first  Segovia video (or guitar video, and if so your very wise in looking at  Segovia, he really is the best. I should know, I'm a music major) but if  this is going to be your first video, I would suggest you buy ""Segovia  at Los Olivos"" first.  This video only interviews the  ""Maestro"" and unlike the other video, he plays only!  An other  good thing about it, is that Segovia is 75 years old when they filmed it.  What that means is that his English is a lot better so you can understand  him. ha,ha.  And also it's better because Segovia in the ""Legacy""  video can be easily misinterpreted as bring a ""jerk"" (he gets  very upset with one of the students in the master classes).  But he really  wasn't like that it all.  Sure he wasn't a greatest teacher, but how was in  those times?  Segovia was a very kind loving man and he can prove me right  by either you seeing the ""At Los Olivos"" video or (better yet)  hearing him play.  No one can play like that without having a giving heart,  no one. However, I am sorry to inform you that I don't really know if the  ""At Los Olivos"" is this best guitar video. I still haven't  received the my two Segovia special orders videos (""Glory of  Span"" and ""Songs Of The Guitar""), and it's been over a month  now. So you might want to look into buying those.  What I can tell you is  that ""At Los Olivos"" is better than a very good  ""Legacy"" video.  And in case your wondering, the ""Peerce,  Anderson & Segovia"" isn't that great.  It only shows the  ""Maestro"" for about 15-20 minutes but still worth buying.  Like I  have said, ""He's the best"".  The ""Maestro"" wasn't able  to save the classical guitar because he could only play a couple of chords,  he was the greatest.",945216000,22,2139,4.330788804071247
7816768,5,6301925831,"This video is 1 hour long.  According to the video box ""this video tribute to Andres Segovia presents revealing interviews and historic performance film footage of the legendary Spanish guitarist...(he) explains  the events which molded his career...The program contains rare excerpts  from performances given over the past four decades on television, in  concert halls, and at the White House."" I find this description to be  accurate.  Commentary is provided by Hugh Downs (the TV news host), Oscar  Ghiglia, and Elliot Fisk, among others.  The video was entertaining and  inspiring.  I particularly enjoyed the video footage of Segovia giving a  master class to students, as well as the other performance footage.  There  wasn't much extended performance footage, but the film gave a brief history  of Segovia's professional life and influences, sprinkled throughout with  performances from various stages of his career.",917568000,19,923,5.539568345323741
