4833869,4,B005M2AKME,"This is a great deal, and it proves that if blu ray really wants to suceed then it needs to do more movies on one disc. There's not reason to put out a single movie
on blu ray for many older titles in particular.  I mean, why wasn't 'return of the living dead 2' on the same disc as the first one?  it's sad but that's what we get usually one movie.  Now echo bridge has lead the way with this release on blu ray.
It's a great deal. But being echo bridge the transfers are not spectacular. They don't look as horrible as some other echo bridge releases like 'from dusk til dawn'
but it's not great to be sure.  still with four movies on one disc I can't complain as much as ONE movie done badly. And these titles were all made to video titles anyway. I have the from dusk til dawn four pack too, the second two look bad for blu ray but they were direct to video titles too, the first however looks like crap. BAD.  THis is better and a good deal but not great.  It's worth getting to get alot of movies on blu ray though.",1321401600,2,1021,4.004926108374384

4833871,3,B005M2AKME,"Four movies crammed on one disc. Quality is watchable but nothing better than that. If you don't already own these sequels, it's worth picking up if you can find it on the cheap but otherwise worth passing up.",1424044800,2,209,4.526315789473684

4833876,3,B005M2AKME,"This bare-bones Blu-ray collection does not include Children of the Corn 2 or 7 as the 6-Film DVD Boxset provided (neither version has the original Children of the Corn sold separately). The original is available in a special anniversary edition on Blu-ray. Buying this value pack will get you half the films in the eight-film Children of the Corn franchise. The transfers are average at best for these (mostly) direct-to-video sequels. Extras would have been nice but this is priced right anyway.

Not Included:
Children of the Corn, Children of the Corn 2, Children of the Corn: Revelation (2001) (Video), Children of the Corn: Genesis (2011)",1377907200,2,644,5.0754716981132075
4833877,5,B005M2AKME,Good value and price for 4 movies/ Enjoyed them. Would recommend to others who like Cthe hildren of corn movies,1367193600,,111,4.6
4833878,1,B005M2AKME,What absurdity to have a 4 film set and leave out part 1 and part 2. Presumably MIRAMAX assumes that everyone has seen the original Children of the Corn (part 1) and the follow up part 2.. Unfortunately I have not and after viewing them ( which I have subsequently purchased ) I am extremely disappointed that this series of movies  have evolved from what I personally consider to be a very mediocre Stephen King short story. The Bluray transfers are appalling . A definite NO NO .recommendation from me and this despite the fact that i am actually a Stephen King fan !!,1362614400,2,570,4.480769230769231

8478988,3,B005M2AKME,Quality is very mediocre for blu ray. The audio in 2.0. Video not up to 1080/24p standard. But generally good as there is no problem in watching the movies. I have asked for refund as I want to check out the DVD collection of 2-7. This is 3-6. If that item wasn't available I would have kept it. Definitely not a bad buy,1478908800,,320,4.095238095238095

The violence is unnecessarily gruesome, farfetched and makes little sense.",1436227200,,242,4.785714285714286
