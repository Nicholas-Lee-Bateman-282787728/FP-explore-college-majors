5324985,5,B009GESIP0,"...this is a must-buy!  Thoroughly enjoyed it, wish it was twice as long!  A real classic for vintage drum lovers.",1392163200,,114,4.65
5324986,5,B009GESIP0,"This DVD is actually the special features from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Century-Project-By-Daniel-Glass/dp/B009GESJ4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Century Project By Daniel Glass</a>. However, it stands alone as a crash course in vintage drums. There are three audiences for the information conveyed: (1) folks who watched the Century Project and were interested in the drums that were discussed and demonstrated in that video, (2) drummers who play nuanced music like jazz who want to capture the sound and vibe of the instruments played in the early days of their music, and studio musicians and producers who understand the value of some of the iconic vintage drums like the Ludwig Black Beauty and Slingerland Radio King, to name but two of many.

I love the format. It's Daniel Glass - the 'star' of the Century Project and a vintage drum collector and player in his own right - and John Aldridge who is well known to the vintage community as an author, publisher (he established Not So Modern Drummer) and engraver who transforms modern drums into works of art.

The format itself is both a discussion between Glass and Aldridge of the gear and the evolution of drums that follows the chronology of the century project. Of course it's scripted, with Glass asking rhetorical questions and in some spots contributing his own insights and knowledge.

However the real star is Aldridge who displays not only an amazing knowledge of drum evolution, but materials science in general. For example, in more than a few places he was able to tie together innovations like ply shells and a 1930s console that employed plexiglass to the innovations in the airline industry. Those astute observations tie together a lot of information external to the drum industry to explain how our own gear was designed and the effect of new materials and manufacturing processes actually affected the evolution of music. A notable example is the invention of the plastic drum head allowed drummers to play louder during an era in which guitar amps were becoming more powerful and the electric bass guitar transformed bass from the quietest instrument in an ensemble to one that could be heard by twisting a knob on an amplifier. This came together to allow music to be played not only louder, but with supporting instruments now on top of the music instead of under it.

As the video breezes through a century of innovations and changes in our gear it touches on some of the iconic stuff such as the 'old K' cymbals, round badge kits and other jargon you will surely encounter as you visit drum forums on the web. You will not come away as an expert by any means, but at least you will be able to understand discussions you encounter and use that information to further build your knowledge of vintage drums.

I mentioned above that you do not need to watch the Century Project to benefit from this video. That's true because I watched this months before getting the other video - I will say that seeing and hearing Glass demonstrate the vintage music that was played on the instruments in this video make getting that one well worth it.",1384473600,4,3165,5.009505703422053

5324989,5,B009GESIP0,"Great video of vintage drums and their history. If you are into old drums, this video is for you, brought to you by an expert on vintage drums",1370217600,,142,4.107142857142857
5324990,5,B009GESIP0,"Kudos to Daniel Glass and Drum Channel for making this its own release and not relegating it to the 'special features' on the Century Project discs. If you have any interest in vintage drums, or interest in the evolution of how drums were made, whatever this DVD costs you will be worth it. The multitude of examples of vintage gear (including gorgeous close-ups), explanations of how things were assembled and how they worked (or didn't work quite right, in some cases), and deep context for why and when some technologies were introduced make this disc a goldmine of information.

Is it instructional? No. But you should know that from looking at the case. Is it educational? Absolutely. The evolution of what eventually became the drumset in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is a fascinating story, and what you get with this 2-disc set is that history told through the drums, cymbals, and hardware across the decades.",1363564800,10,927,4.867088607594937
5324991,5,B009GESIP0,"Being a long time jazz drummer wannabe and one who plays vintage Slingerland and a choice 1938 Radio King snare, this fine DVD by Daniel Glass is a must have; I watched it start to finish when it landed on my doorstep and have gone back to it a half dozen times, so fun and informative this effort is. For those of us who walk into modern drum shops and corporate box music stores, look at the gleaming stacks of new DW, Ludwig, Gretsch, Yamaha, Pearl and other contemporary companies and sigh..........""Nothing here for me"" this DVD will only heighten and expand your enjoyment of fine old drum equipment.
Starting with Civil War drums Mr. Glass takes us on a highly entertaining and informative romp up along the time-line of the history of the drum ""Kit or Set"" to what has become today's modern style drum kit. Daniel Glass's knowledge of the subject is of Master Thesis level and he is incredibly adept at making the presentation understandable and did I mention entertaining as well?!?!?!
Throughout the DVD examples of vintage and highly collectible drums from rope tension civil war era drums up to early turn of the century sets featuring the latest innovations to big band bop and rock. Notable were the evolution in the early 20th Century of the bass drum pedal and sock cymbals [they evolved to the hi hat] as the drummer consolidated what had been three or four instrumentalist in an orchestra into one person able to play bass drum, snare, cymbals and trap sounds. Dixieland, Chicago Blues, Swing, be-bop and rock are all covered by decade and each era is illustrated by some of the most majestic and pristine editions of signature vintage drums and sets you'd be hard pressed to see anywhere save for Mr. Maxwell's heady emporiums of fine drum antiquity in NYC and Illinois. The vintage equipment alone is staggereing in its beauty, oftentimes rarity and come alive under the masterful sticks of Mr. Glass, bringing us an aural glimpse of what those drums sounded like when they were new.
The DVD can stand alone in its excellance although I would highly recommend purchasing this along with Mr. Glass's companion DVD, The Century Project which further examines the evolving drum set within the framework of popular music during the past 100 years. Mr. Glass is a high caliber and schooled jazz drummer and adept at each decades style and rythmic nuance. I especially enjoyed the double drumming which arose post Civil War where a drummer played a snare propped on a common chair and a bass drum with a single pair of sticks. Brian along with members of the Royal Crowne Review, The Brian  Setzer Orch. and other band mates from other groups he's played with give us top notch versions of what that drums within the context of what music was like for each period examined. Each time and style Daniel is playing and swinging behind a stunning example of that particular periods high end drum kit and we are transfixed much like a period listener was hearing the tune for the first time when it was modern and contemporary.
He also has an uncanny ability to weave all the key historical moments within a decade such as prohibition, WW II along with some obscure but relevant to the evolution of music historical footnotes into how and why the drum kit evolved the way it did. A review must be objective so I can report a few times during presentations I became impatient as Daniel wove history into rather long treatises instead of going directly to and playing the vintage equipment he was talking about. It's never boring though and not a real detractor as the DVD's are close to flawless if you appreciate and lust after vintage drums and drum kits.
If you love drums, get weak kneed over the idea of owning and playing and gigging with fine vintage drum equipment you must have
these DVD's, they will only elevate your enjoyment to loftier levels and have you poring over drum classified ads, roaming E Bay, garage sales and seeking out old dusty Mom and Pop music shops for that item of percussive elusiveness with a renewed and inspired passion. These DVD's are a true labor of love and affection from a most highly talented drummer and musical historian, we drummers being the receipient of a gift akin to a fine wine, a magnificent sunset or a soul stirring ballad. Thank you Mr. Glass and to you Vintage Drum Freaks............ENJOY!!

8541202,4,B009GESIP0,"Much better than the ""Century Project"" DVD from which it is spun off.  Fewer attempts at cultural context mean a lot fewer blatant historical inaccuracies.  This DVD sticks to the subject and it covers it pretty well.  But . . . you're going to have to forgive the cheesy, archaic production values.  This DVD is worth the price to fanatical drummers who buy it for the information.  For anyone else?  Nah.",1522022400,,406,4.647887323943662
8541203,5,B009GESIP0,"If you love drums as much as I do you're gonna love 'Traps; The Incredible Story of Vintage Drums'.  Its a ""leave me alone I'm busy"" kind of DVD where you get to hear a scholarly yet fun and informal player and collector explore a topic just for you. Traps as in Traps the Boy Wonder. One thing probably not mentioned by other reviews is that it will improve you playing.  Why?  for the same reason sailors in Norway and Sweden are required to learn on Sailing vessels before getting on modern powered ships. Consider the few recordings we have of Baby Dodds: a drummer admired by every great drummer that came along in future incarnations of masters of the craft. The sheer power yet subtlety that Dodds could conjure form his noisy under- engineered contraption (pun intended) created a realm in which all the other players in the ensemble could flourish.  And all without drawing undue attention to himself. Bring that insight to work with you and like Dodds and Papa Joe Jones and those other hidden gems (who maybe only Daniel Glass knows on a first name basis)  you will most definitely be in demand as a drummer and know why they just could not not smile when playing.  You will also be well on your way on the path of discovery of the past and the future of time.",1461542400,,1271,4.456896551724138

8541206,4,B009GESIP0,"Well-organized. Contains interesting and accurate information about the evolution of the drum set.
Omitted name the inventor (Dee Dee Chandler, I think) of the bass drum pedal; however, did include information about the  first BD pedal manufacturer, Ludwig. Overall, I did enjoy ""Traps....."". Included the definition of term,  traps, which I did not know, thank you!",1425686400,,366,5.517857142857143

8541210,4,B009GESIP0,I enjoyed this DVD. But I wished Daniel Glass would shut the hell up and let John Aldridge talk more. John is the real authority here not Daniel Glass. Too much mouth from Glass.,1402012800,,178,4.264705882352941
