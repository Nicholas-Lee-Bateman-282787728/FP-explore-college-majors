8545115,5,B009XJ97EE,"Another great performance by Helene Fischer. She has multiple talents including a fantastic singing voice. Seems to be a really nice, genuine person too. If you are a Helene fan, the DVD is definitely worth owning. If you're new to this artist, the DVD of her 2013 Farbenspiel open air concert at Waldbuhne in Berlin is the one I would buy first.",1497139200,,346,4.596774193548387

8545120,5,B009XJ97EE,Helene Fischer is a real sleeper (no pun intended). All aspects of the show were excellent as was Helene.  I am sure she would be an enormous hit in the United States.  Once you see this DVD I am sure you will agree.,1376438400,2,216,4.0
8545121,5,B009XJ97EE,"The Blu ray disk arrived in time as expected.  There are 26 songs in German and 6 songs in English.  I liked ""I will always love you"" very much.",1374969600,2,144,3.9310344827586206
8545122,4,B009XJ97EE,"It's coded for Europe (I guess) so my portable will not play it, but fortunately my main Blu-ray player handles it just fine.  I can't believe we haven't heard more about Helene in the USA.",1374019200,3,189,4.4
8545123,5,B009XJ97EE,"I have not actually received this DVD yet.  Amazon promised delivery by Dec. 20, but shippment is delayed.  I have 4 other DVDs of her live concert performances and I simply can't wait to get this one of her 2012 tour.

Helene is a beautiful, sexy 28 year old woman with incredible talent for singing, dancing, and acting.  She has a big voice like Celine Dion and she can perform any genre you care to hear.  She can hold her own with people like Micheal Bolton and Andrea Bocelli, in English or Italian, and she performs her own hits in German.

She is a native Russian(Siberia) who immigrated to Germany as a small child.  Thanks to that Russian heritage, she also performs ethnic Russian balads and dances (complete with squat kicks) in Russian.  And BTW, don't be surprised to see her ascend 40 feet in the air while perfoming a song in conjuction with aerial acrobatics from a swing, or a cube, or hanging draperies, or just a Peter Pan style cable.

This gal is a classy, elegant lady who seems to be genuinely humble and grateful to her audience.  Today, she is the biggest star in Germany, playing to sold out venues every where she goes, yet she stays relatively unaffected by her fame and notoriety.  She is not pierced or tattooed, that I can see, and so far has remained fairly a-political.  I really hope that she can endure her success.  In the mean time, I am thrilled to get a chance to spend some money to buy her records and DVDs.",1356220800,8,1449,4.443181818181818
