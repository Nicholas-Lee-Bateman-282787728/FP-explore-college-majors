8094036,5,B000BYA4LU,"To pick up where the Pokemon ""Advanced"" Season left off, ""Advanced Challenge"" offers Pokemon fans more exciting adventures, featuring Ash, Pikachu, Brock, May, and Max! Plus, any DVD that features five episodes or more, in my book, is a winner. :)

Here are some comments and observations I had, regarding each of the episodes:

""Exploud and Clear:"" It was a riot to see Exploud go crazy, plus his reaction to being ""captured"" by Team Rocket is priceless! Both Exploud and Grovyle battle like fierce rivals, similar to the way Seviper battled Zangoose, as seen in the ""Zigzag Zangoose"" episode! Notice that, when Team Rocket fires their cork gun, for the second time, the number of corks increases from just three to many more, as they are seen shooting through the air!

""Go Go Ludicolo!:"" Poncho's voice sounds similar to the voice acting of George Lopez from the ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" movie! This episode starts off on a sad note for Corphish, but the Pokemon really shines as the episode progresses! Too bad the heroes and Poncho ended up eating Brock's stew, near the end of the episode, instead of Poncho treating the heroes to cheeseburgers, like he mentioned earlier on!

""A Double Dilemma:"" Poor Ash never catches a break with the ""Norman Fans"" nor the reporter! Pikachu is in tip-top shape, throughout this episode! I can't get over how the guy who lived next door to May and Max actually thought that the disguised Meowth and Wobbuffet looked just like the two siblings! The reporter's question to Team Rocket is classic: ""Who the Pokemon are you?!"" :)

""Love, Petalburg Style!:"" This is the official Pokemon ""soap opera"" episode, when it comes to Norman, Caroline, and Nurse Joy! Strange how Kenny wasn't originally featured in ""There's No Place Like Hoenn,"" the first episode to feature May and Max's parents. Kenny and Caroline's behavior is hilarious to watch, once May and Max mention Beautifly! I get a kick out of Caroline's excuse for the scene: ""I've just been trying to work some exercise into my housework! Ah-ha-ha-ha!"" Some great script work for the story includes Max interrupting Kenny's important information to the heroes, concerning Norman and Caroline ... Just when the audience is eagerly awaiting what Kenny is about to say, Max distracts everyone by pointing out the different Pokemon that belong to his father, on three occasions! Nice build-up within this scene ... It's Kenny versus Max when it comes to someone ""having the floor!""

""Balance of Power:"" Slakoth's abilities are incredible! Notice how it sounds like both Norman and Slakoth pronounce the name Slakoth as ""Slak-on,"" once Slakoth first appears! The ""Overgrow"" scene took me by surprise! Good moral message about losing and winning at the end of the episode.

There is only one negative point to this DVD (This includes all of the DVD volumes for this Season of Pokemon) ... Under the ""Bonus Features"" menu, both the opening and closing themes are featured, yet they are already featured within each of the individual episodes, so to feature the exact same thing again, in a bonus feature, is redundant. However, this sort of thing doesn't really bother me as it might other fans of the Pokemon series who expect more from bonus features, and it doesn't take away from my overall rating on this release ... I just had to mention this to upcoming purchasers of the Pokemon ""Advanced Challenge"" series who have high expectations upon checking out the bonus features. Fortunately, there is a positive point to the ""Bonus Features"" section, and this includes brief descriptions of a couple of the upcoming ""Advanced Challenge"" episodes from future DVD releases ... That was nice. :)

*Before I close, note that there are a couple of differences between the opening and closing themes of ""Advanced Challenge"" ... In the intro, there is footage of Drew and Roselia, but during the ending sequence, the footage is replaced by a shot of Professor Oak, Ash's Mother, and Tracy. Also, the tail-end of the closing theme features a far-off image of the heroes, with each character facing in a different direction. Usually, in Seasons past, the Pokemon ending themes are edited versions of the opening themes, but on this occasion, there are some subtle differences between the two! :)

In closing, I have to say that everyone who contributed in making the Pokemon episodes and the DVD sets did a fantastic job! :) Thanks for reading! God Bless...
