8365533,5,B00008G8SA,"Platinum discs have certainly issued many discs and disc sets with 'the good ole stuff' for western fans.

This disc containing Stories of the Century is taken from an Emmy Award series from the year 1954.  It starred Jim Davis and Mary Castle as detectives working for the Southwestern Railroad.  Their work found them involved with robbers, Indians, and other bandits.  Most of the episode ideas came from actual newspaper archives of the 1890s.  The running time for this DVD is near 200 minutes having DVD features on Frank and Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Black Bart, Doc Holiday, the Dalton gang, John Wesley Hardin, Johnny Ringo, and Tom Horn. Quite a mixture of western tales and all brought to you from the TV year 1954.

I have the boxed set which also includes 8 episodes, over 3 hours, of The Lone Ranger, and a series call U.S. Marshal (Sheriff of Cochise).  Although only 1 show from U.S. Marshal is offered, 7 shows from The Lone Ranger are included: Masked Rider, Message From Abe, Tender Foot, Cannonball McKay, High Heels, Old Joe's Sister, and Finder Keeper. This disc also times out at close to 200 minutes.

Great discs from Platinum, all digitally mastered with interactive menus with scene index. For the price and quality you cannot do better.
