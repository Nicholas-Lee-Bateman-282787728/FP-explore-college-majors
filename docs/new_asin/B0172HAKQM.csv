7489192,5,B0172HAKQM,"I was only able to watch this movie once and I thought that it was a terrific treat to watch three solid actresses Robin Givens, Farrah Fawcett (and this down to earth lady did not deserve to die so soon in life, I blame that Jack-ass twerp of a man ""oddly know as Ryan"") and Melissa Gilbert.

It was enjoyable as far as watching the entire ensemble cast. Well worth the purchase for your movie collection. I loved how the women interacted as friends and it was a refreshing change to watch down to earth women play the roles of (in a way, themselves) but in a way that was something that --as an audience--you'd want to be part of. Imagine having a midnight massage with your best girl friend--non-sexual, but just fun and unusual. I am adding this to my wish list. This is good for those in their 40 something years, a guilty pleasure, but a welcome pleasure, particuarly being that this is Farrah's last role. This is much better than the former Hollywood WIves.

The first Hollywood Wives novel is very good, but the TV version was weak. The new generation was surprisingly much better. To understand the enjoyment, you have to have been born between 1965-1970 to really appreciate these actresses working together in a Jackie Collins based novel.

There were some surprising scenes in which I thought that things were not going to end well for the scene of the stalking....it was pretty disturbing and Collins does base these incidents from people that she personally knows in Hollywood which is what makes certain themes in this one , realistic, just because  of who would even think up these events if one were not inspired by what the author knew.

So, with the others, I agree that this is well worth your time, if you like these actresses and their past work. The price is reasonable and I would suggest to purchase it because it is difficult to find these actress types of this quality talent in any current project of this time. Even better, I thought that I was the only one who really admired the performances regardless of what others think. It may have it's sleaze, however, I have a dear friend who lives in the heart of Hollywood and he knows everyone from damned ""snooki"" to ""Kardashian"" to Lil Kim and pretty much what Jackie Collins portrays about Hollywood ""anything"" is pretty much true, because anything TRULY goes in Hollywood and there are those who are so wealthy that their security is far better than any kind that we will ever see. It scary how rich a person can be....have fun Gen Xers...",1343779200,5,2519,4.588888888888889
7489193,3,B0172HAKQM,"I bought this because i remembered seeing the first hollywood wives and i loved it, I also love Farrah so i assumed this would be good as well.
I have to say i was disapointed, the acting wasen't very good and the story line could have been better.",1341792000,,248,4.1875
7489194,1,B0172HAKQM,"Farrah Fawcett made some terrific TV movies/miniseries in her time - ""Small Sacrifices"", ""The Burning Bed"". Unfortunately, ""Hollywood Wives"" is not one of them.

Even if you see this in a bargain bin like I did, and are expecting a camp-tastic, over-the-top, so-bad-it's-good hootfest like ""Lace"" or ""Valley of the Dolls 1981"", don't bother with it. You will be sadly disappointed.

Despite the fact that this is a Hollywood production about Hollywood, the script is ludicrous. We are expected to believe that Farrah's character is a successful 50-something actress with a hit film in which she also performs the soundtrack herself. Can you actually name a 50-something actress who had a hit single from her own film?

None of the characters in this fiasco are likeable. The male actors are all forgettable. Robin Givens and Melissa Gilbert both play self-centered, ""put-upon"" women. I actually found myself identifying with the villain more than any of the other characters. I was hoping he would do away with Fawcett's spoiled daughter.

I miss Farrah. She seemed like such a fun person. When I want to remember her I will watch her as Jill Munroe, Diane Downs....anything but in this mess!

This DVD is for completists who need to see everything Farrah's ever done, everyone else needs to stay far, far away.",1278201600,3,1311,4.995412844036697

7489197,3,B0172HAKQM,"Hollywood Wives: The New Generation is a sleazy story about self-centered women. It reminds you of a drug store novel. However, Farrah gives her last performance in a leading role and proves she is still sexy at 56. Also, Farrah was a damn good actress. It is wonderful that she had a good leading role before she got sick and ultimately left us. The draw backs are the younger actors. Even though they are pretty to look at, the actors just can't act. Melissa Gilbert does a good role and so does Robin Givens with Jack Scalia. Robin Givens proves she can act but her role is small compared to Farrah's and Melissa's. However, then again, I guess they are bigger stars. If you are a Farrah fan, this is a must for your collection. Farrah proves she is a sex symbol in her late fifties and women can be just as sexy as men, late in life. She will become a legend like Marilyn Monroe. In summary, the movie involves wife beating, adultery, selfishness, and kidnapping. However, this is Farrah's last starring role and a good one to remember her as being the sex symbol and actress that she was.",1254182400,23,1093,4.442786069651741

Love all the actors/actresses in this, and find it amazing what some of them went on to do later in their careers. Anthony Hopkins for one, went on to win an Oscar six years later. Candice Bergen went on to play 'Murphy Brown'. Andrew Stevens is so incredibly handsome! The clothes with the oversized shoulder pads and large earrings are a hoot!

7489220,5,B0172HAKQM,"Just a sample of the cringe worthy dialogue, including the laugh out loud 'I get kidnapped by a band of pygmies' delivered by sexpot Gina Germaine (Suzanne Somers) to Mary Hart dressed in a souffl brought to you by Joan Collins clothes horse Nolan Miller.  So why the 5 stars?  Because this would have to be the funniest, craziest, over the top romp produced in the over the top, button down conservative 1980s.

Best: Candice Bergen brings to us a hint of what is to come with Murphy Brown ('oh pleeeze'), Stephanie Powers looks as glamorous as ever, and boozily sums up the series 'tacky, tacky, tacky', Suzanne Somers is great as the bouncy blonde-not-quite bimbo with satin sheets, lacy underwear and the old hidden camera behind the mirror trick.  Angie Dickinson and Joanna Cassidy brings a touch of class, while Mary Crosby channels her Kiristen Shepherd, did I really shoot JR?? performance.  Laura Branigan screaming out Hollywood Wives, wondering what the heck some of those lyrics ('take her hand, she's bound to explore') mean!??!

Worst: The men.  It's hard to take Robert Stack seriously after his turn in Airplane, while Andrew Stevens is cartoonish in his doppelgnger role.  It would be fun to know what Anthony Hopkins thinks about his involvement with the series.  Rod Steiger's wig.  Steve Forrest the ageing lech.  Clearly the series is about the women.

It was well known that Jackie Collins was disappointed with the final product and some of the casting choices.  However, the series does capture some of the fun and essence of the book in an Aaron Spelling kind of way.  When last visiting Australia in 2013, Jackie Collins mentioned that plans were underway to produce a new Hollywood Wives.  30 years later, with less restrictions on networks to really spice things up, let's hope so!",1452038400,2,1810,4.888524590163934
7489221,5,B0172HAKQM,"If you loved Dynasty and 1980s over-the-top glitz then you can't go wrong with this soapy mini-series (written by Jackie Collins - RIP).  Where else are you going to find Candice Bergen, Suzanne Somers, Anthony Hopkins, Angie Dickinson and Andrew Stevens under one roof commiserating about being rich, good-looking and famous?",1451779200,3,326,5.392156862745098
7489222,3,B0172HAKQM,"VEI has gifted us with the original 1985 TV adaptation of the Jackie Collins novel HOLLYWOOD WIVES and though the DVD comes with a disclaimer stating they were given the best possible source material, I found nothing wrong with the video qualityits not HD but there are no defects to be seen either.

As far as the miniseries itself goes, Collins trashy pulp would seem to be the perfect fodder for Aaron Spelling, king of TV glitz in the 70 and 80sall style and no substance. But don't get your hopes up, this is in no way as much a fun, guilty pleasure as something like LACE (though it is miles better than the dreadful 2003 update starring Farrah Fawcett, Melissa Gilbert and Robin Givens). Its quite bland actually, though the second and third parts are more interesting than the first, which has to take its time establishing the caricatures (no thats not a typo). The best thing about this thing is the parade of stars.

Candice Bergen plays the long-suffering wife of aging actor Steve Forrest; her best friend is Joanna Cassidy, divorced from director Anthony Hopkins whos now married to Stefanie Powers, whos just penned a hot new screenplay in which famous sex kitten Suzanne Somers will do anything including blackmail and adultery to land a meaty role. Andrew Stevens is the young hunky struggling actor looking for his big break while trying to support his lovely new bride Catherine Mary Stuart.

Suffering from major Daddy issues is Mary Crosby as the rich daughter of famous retired actor Robert Stack, while Angie Dickinson plays the best agent in Tinseltown. Rod Steiger is a powerful producer and Roddy McDowell appears as Stevens former pimp.

The sordid aspects of the storyline seem quite quaint now and I had the twist figured out pretty early on. Andrew Stevens does double-duty donning Charles Mansonesque hair and makeup and an odd pigeon-toed gait playing a vengeful weirdo. The rest of the male actors also sport more eyeliner and foundation than the ladies. Stef Powers looks more glamorous here than she did in HART TO HART and theres a terribly cheesy 80s theme song by the late Laura Branigan (she couldn't have been that hard up for cash coming off her terrific SELF CONTROL album).

Interesting to see for the parade of stars, but the plot and execution make it seem like nothing more than a feature-length DYNASTY episode.

7489226,3,B0172HAKQM,"I don't remember exactly how I found out about this movie. I may have just been looking for something new to buy. And it is the last movie that ACTRESS FARRAH FAWCETT appeared in.  I don't always read the book that a movie is based on, but in this case I wish I had. This movie, to me, seem choppy and to short. I like JACKIE COLLINS, though I haven't read every book she has written. I'm used to her books being made into much longer movies, at least three hours. If you enjoy movies about characters who are driven by fame, fortune and lust then this movie may just feed your soul, however it may not be very satisfying. The cost wasn't to bad for eighty-nine minutes. If it hadn't been for FARRAH FAWCETT, I may have only given this movie two stars. For a filler, this movie will do. If you don't care what is in your DVD PLAYER, this movie will do. Whoever put this movie together should be embarrassed. The bottom line is, it is somewhat watchable. Even I can bear it once in awhile. This is one of those: ""THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD, IT WAS GOOD"" type movies.",1412726400,2,1060,4.196078431372549
