2353709,5,B000A2X5F0,I love this workout. Its so much fun you actually forget you are working out.  It has great cardio routines to burn fat and carrying my 20 lb baby makes for great strength training as well lol.  my 3 yr old loves it to he dances around me and the baby while I do it so everyone ends up working out together :-),1219276800,,310,3.9047619047619047
2353710,3,B000A2X5F0,"Do not buy this product for more than $17, the Infantastic website sells it for around $17. Anyone selling a used DVD for $49.99 is seriously ripping you off!",1191628800,,158,4.482758620689655
2353711,5,B000A2X5F0,"I love this workout! You do have to wait until your baby can hold her own head, but you can do it on your own, as well. When my baby was finaly the right age (around four months) she was to heavy for me to hold, so she sits while I dance, and enjoys the video. She laughs out loud every time it starts, and giggles at the babies. I also use some of the steps while holding her when she gets fussy, and she loves it.",1172016000,,415,3.781609195402299
2353712,5,B000A2X5F0,I found it very difficult to find time to work out after I had my third baby.  This DVD made it very easy (it's broken into segments so you can do as much or as little as your schedule allows) and my baby loves it.  My older kids like to dance along too.  I wish I had known about this workout much sooner.,1167782400,3,306,3.8253968253968256
2353713,5,B000A2X5F0,"This is by far the best postnatal workout DVD I have seen.  Three warm-ups, six cardio dance routines, one stretch and one slow dance work perfectly as a group or as an a la carte menu if you are short on time.  I also like the fact that all the moves are VERY CLEARLY demonstrated BEFORE the actual dances, while you have an option to skip the demonstrations and go straight to the dances.  It is a very well and smartly executed product.  I also like the fact that all the dances are done, not in a gym, but in warm and pleasant home environments.

2353714,5,B000A2X5F0,"My baby and I just love this DVD.  The dances are simple to learn, but they really burn off the baby fat.  There is a good variety of music which is nice if we're in a particular mood- no excuses for not exercising!  I also like that there are so many songs, giving us something to build up to; my baby and I still can't quite make it through all the dances.  This DVD really makes exercise challenging and fun while bonding with my new baby- exactly what every new mommy needs!",1156723200,4,478,4.163043478260869
2353715,1,B000A2X5F0,"This may be great a product, but you won't find out through Amazon. After waiting months and getting numerous postponement e-mails from Amazon, I finally cancelled my order. Although Amazon claims this DVD is available, I have a feeling I was never going to receive it. If you're interested, I suggest looking for another vendor.",1155340800,8,329,5.0
2353716,1,B000A2X5F0,"I had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the Infantastic dvds from Amazon. I waited over two months, kept getting reassured that they were still coming, and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know. Not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme, but Amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days, which is at best a misrepresentation, and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can't provide the product at all at this point.

I don't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available - Amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted.",1154649600,7,835,4.457516339869281
2353717,5,B000A2X5F0,"I saw an article about these Infantastic DVD's in Parents Magazine, and now I have both ""Baby-Reps"" & ""Dance-Baby-Dance"" (I actually got them cheaper from the infantastic site when I got them for my friends later.) All I can say is *I LOVE THEM!*

I've seen all kinds of pregnancy videos & postpartum videos -- I have somewhat of a collection now that I have four kids -- and these top them all hands down. The workouts are definitely challenging, & you can get a good workout from a bunch of videos -- but it's the ""bonding with baby"" aspect that is so awesome with these. It's one of our favorite things to do together -- great way to lose that baby fat & have a blast with your new addition!!

They've got demo videos & lots more info on the infantastic site too. Highly recommended.",1133827200,20,786,4.376712328767123
2353718,5,B000A2X5F0,"I got these DVDs after having my second child Joel, and only wish they'd been around for my first baby! You actually do the exercises with your baby -- (Joel loves the action) so with these videos I kill two birds with one stone - I get my workout, and for my baby it's ""playtime with mommy"" (and he's normally ready for a nap right after).

*The only problem* was that Amazon never sends the DVDs (always out of stock??) - I ended up getting them directly from the infantastic website & they arrived in 3 days.

I suggest starting with the lighter exercises for the first couple of weeks, then working up to the more challenging stuff. I generally alternate between the strength/toning DVD (Baby-Reps) & the cardio/dance DVD (Dance-Baby-Dance), depending on my mood. Dance Baby Dance is a little too long for me still, but I'll build up to it. Great stuff - I recommend it!",1127952000,23,874,4.525316455696203
8073252,1,B000A2X5F0,Horrible.  Horrible music and exercises.  It's more fun and heart healthy to play w/ baby.,1472169600,,90,4.933333333333334
8073253,3,B000A2X5F0,"I really liked the idea of this video and I bought it to use in between mom-baby fitness classes, but we've done it twice and I've been disappointed both times. For me, the major problems are as follows:
a. It doesn't feel like great exercise. My upper half gets stiff from holding my daughter and my lower half doesn't really get such great exercise.
b. My daughter (just shy of 4 months) doesn't love it. It was too bouncy for her. An older baby might enjoy it, though.
c. I didn't particularly care for the song selection.

That said, once in a while it's an ok thing if you're desperate to move and stuck in the house alone with a child who is awake. It's better than nothing but not nearly as good as a proper mom-baby fitness class or just a nice walk in the park or turning on music and just dancing (when she was newborn, my daughter loved to waltz and more recently she *loves* the electric slide).",1424822400,,907,4.304093567251462
8073254,3,B000A2X5F0,"I did use this with my daughter and she liked it, but the songs are old-fashioned and some of the dances are really stupid.  It would be awesome if there were an updated version of this idea",1386115200,,190,4.135135135135135
8073255,1,B000A2X5F0,"Poorly shot, need to have more interaction with kids as you can either workout or play with kids and this is not made to work with both",1376870400,,135,4.037037037037037
8073256,2,B000A2X5F0,"The DVD arrived in a timely manner, which was great because I was so excited to get it.
 While my son napped, I viewed the DVD to get an idea of what to expect. It is explained to be a cardio workout, which is great, that's pretty much all it is. At first, I was somewhat impressed with the first workout/song, but then quickly realized the rest of the workouts were just slightly different versions of each other. It's basically dancing while holding your baby. If you know how to dance, and know how to hold your baby, then you don't need this DVD. The host gives instructions on how to do the steps before each workout, but doesn't mention if and how the steps help to isolate certain areas, improve strength, nothing. I felt like I was watching a kids' dancing instructor. In addition, the music was dull. A couple of the songs were OK (somewhat entertaining), but I couldn't imagine dancing to most of it, at least not in front of anyone. Sorry to say, I'm returning this DVD as soon as I can.",1357689600,,998,4.365591397849462
8073257,3,B000A2X5F0,"This video was fun at first, but I feel it is very expensive for what it is. I could turn on my own music and dance with her for free. I don't think this program is worth the money I paid for it.",1357084800,,195,3.558139534883721
8073258,2,B000A2X5F0,"If you think you want this video because like to dance around the house, save yourself the money and just turn on music you like.  If you want a good workout, get another video.  This DVD is neither fun, nor instructional, nor a good workout, nor convenient.  They try to make it instructional above all by having in-depth discussions on all of the dance moves before each song section - but if they would have just used better camera angles, we could have figured out how to do these simple steps (like in every other workout video), but what's worse is that half of each song is just ""freestyle,"" so you have no instruction and are just supposed to dance around.  You can skip the instruction, but you have to manually skip through the songs you don't want (there is no ""personalize workout"" option), and you don't want some because there are 3 warm-up possibilities.  The music is awful (my husband thinks it was all freeware music so they wouldn't have to pay any royalties).  My baby didn't even have fun - the baby isn't ""used"" at all for the dances - you just hold your baby and dance (there is one song where you use the baby as an air guitar, but that is it, and it is a bit awkward and doesn't seem to target any muscle groups).
The moms and babies were cute, though, and it was neat that they showed moms in ""normal"" situations (dancing around the house in sweatpants).",1340668800,2,1380,4.413385826771654
8073259,5,B000A2X5F0,"Honestly, I am saddened that Infantastic is out of business and i could not buy this new!  I would honestly buy this for every pregnant friend I had if i could.  It is a lot of fun and my 2 mos old baby loves it.  It's fun to sing and dance with her and especially helps during her fussy periods.  Highly recommend this product...too bad it is not as available as it used to be.",1282608000,,378,4.0
8073260,5,B000A2X5F0,"I purchased this DVD when my first daughter was born. We had lots of fun dancing this. She loved it and asked for it all the time. I would get a great workout and we both had lots of fun. We danced together since she was just a few weeks until she was around 2.5 and got way too heavy for me.

I'll definitely use this DVD with my newborn in a few more weeks.",1260144000,,359,3.7866666666666666
8073261,5,B000A2X5F0,i had no problem getting these videos from amazon as other reviews note they did.  i checked out their website and it appears they (infantastic) went out of business so i was really glad to be able to get the video from amazon since this is my favorite workout to do with my baby boy who is currently 9 weeks old.  i recommend this most highly.,1243728000,,344,4.196969696969697
