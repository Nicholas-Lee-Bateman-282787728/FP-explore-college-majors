7846131,2,6303425232,"I bought this video because Ian Carmichael is one of my favorite British actors and I had just read his autobiography.  I was curious to see any movies he had starred in prior to his masterful portrayal of Lord Peter Wimsey on the PBS Mystery series.  This movie popped up when I searched Amazon, it was reasonably priced and I tucked it in with a few other items for free shipping.

The best part of the movie may be getting to see Ian Carmichael wandering the grounds of a sanatorium in a knee length robe.  He has nice knees.  He and Jean Simmons struggled to do their best with a plotless vehicle and a mundane script.  But alas, they failed.

From the story description I expected something similar to the Alec Guinness movie in which the titmousy hero thinks he has not long to live and makes one final stab at having a real life.  Romance is doomed because one of the hapless pair has a fatal disease.  In Moment in Time, the prospect of a fatal disease looms large and then quietly fades away.

There are some witty situations which Carmichael plays up as well as he can, but he must have been disappointed with the potential for the character when he read the script.  The term ""flat-lined"" might be the best description for this movie.",1374710400,2,1245,4.440528634361233
