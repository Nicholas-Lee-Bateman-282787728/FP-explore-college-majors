The dong is a small race in China, not have its own words, but use the songs to kept their culture and history. The songs are only be teach by person to person, since they do not have word or musical mark.  currently, only few people able to sing those songs. but this film record those TRUE and original voice. This film won the best music award from the 16th International Family Film Festival.
Beside the songs, I enjoy the Dong dance, admire the young lady's sacrifice to let the Dong culture and song to kept it by teaching those children to learn it.",1303430400,,627,4.26890756302521
