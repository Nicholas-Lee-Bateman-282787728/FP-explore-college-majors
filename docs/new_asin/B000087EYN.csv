7979823,4,B000087EYN,I thought this volume was kind of weird. Don't really know if I get it either. But I still like it!,1147996800,,99,3.761904761904762
7979824,5,B000087EYN,"I am obsessed with this series. In fact, I was hooked from the very first episode. Its decidedly adult sensibility, humor, icon-twisting symbolism and out-and-out romanticism make Utena an extremely engaging and thought-provoking series. In fact, Utena is great in any form...TV series, the movie ""Adolescence of Utena"" and the manga (only 3 of 5 volumes are currently available in English). Each format takes a slightly different swing at the plot and characterizations, and each is an extremely rich experience.",1060905600,,513,5.425
7979825,5,B000087EYN,"I'll start off on a general note--Charles Solomon simply doesn't understand Utena. If you like anime, give this series a try--it's amazing. And this DVD in particular is quite good. In some ways Mikage is my favorite character--he's certainly one of the most tragic. But then, the strength of this series is that every character is tragic, fully rendered, and engaging. So are Utena's premises, animation, and concepts. (The dubbing isn't bad either--but the Japanese is best.) This DVD in particular is central to understanding the series--for those of you who are still confused, I'll give you a hint. What Akio tells Tokiko in the middle episode--""Only those who leave this school will ever become adults""--is crucial to the series' meaning. Charles Solomon implies that Utena is only about adolescents, but it's really about adolescence, and about growing out of it. The series' most disturbing implication is that more people have refused to grow up than we might like to think. But really, dueling galore! Who could want more in an anime series?",1052611200,4,1051,5.08092485549133
