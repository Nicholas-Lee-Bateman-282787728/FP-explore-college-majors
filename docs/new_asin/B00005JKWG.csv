1529262,5,B00005JKWG,"I was very plesantly surprised with this film, I went in hoping for at least an adequate horror movie, but this gripped me like no other work in the genre has since the original Evil Dead.  The suspense is extraordinarily well handled, and if you are a true fan of this sort of thing, it will have you looking behind you and checking for weird noises around the house after you are finished watching - it's that effective.  Direction, acting, photography and special effects (although nothing too flashy here, the suspense is what really counts) are tops - it's almost unusual to find something so artistically sound coming out of Hollywood these days.  As to why this film was so shabbily treated by the studio, it's anybody's guess.  It should easily find its audience on DVD, where it is bound to get the classic status it deserves.  A must for every horror film buff's collection.",1047427200,9,884,4.67741935483871

1529264,4,B00005JKWG,"I went in thinking this would be a ""light"" horror movie, and was pleasantly surprised. The overall tone is tense and there are spooky moments- but it's more of a mystery/thriller than anything else. The performances are understated yet outstanding (the actors found a way to keep it interesting while smushed together on a sub) and whether you figure out the plot twist beforehand or not- it's well paced and keeps you guessing.",1047254400,,428,4.876712328767123
1529265,5,B00005JKWG,This is a superb film.  It beautifully blends supernatural suspense with an amazingly accurate depiction of the structure and function of the WWII fleet submarine.

1529400,2,B00005JKWG,"2 stars, Creep Factor: Yes, Ending: Easy to Guess, Gore: Not much
This was a great concept but the execution was mediocre. Setting a ghost story on a WWII submarine was inspired. The tight quarters, the claustrophobia, the strange creaks & sounds from being under the sea! Very spooky.
At first blush, I thought this was a good movie but after thinking it through I'll say it is average. Very little suspense to who & what the ghost is. The plot follows your typical haunted house plot. And, of course, it's easy to know who survives. I even figured out why the ghost was terrorizing the crew within the first 30 minutes.
But it does have it's fill of scares & creeps. Zach Galifianakis is in this but in a serious role.
The movie lost me about 2/3 in when there was an explosion in the submarine but the hull was not breached. Most improbable.",1454371200,,844,4.451612903225806

1529605,5,B00005JKWG,"I absolutely love this movie and can't, for the life of me, figure out why it isn't as popular as some of those horrible shaky-cam fiascoes that hit the big screen. Maybe it's because Below is sort of old school horror. It relies more on creating a creepy atmosphere and character development than relying heavily on CGI. Reminds me of a ghost story told around the campfire. Beautifully directed too. There's not a single moment when I sat there thinking ""they shouldn't have shot that"" or ""wow, I can't believe that character was that stupid."" If you like Hitchcock. If you remember spending nights waiting up for Night Gallery, Kolchack, or the Twilight Zone, you'll love this film.",1410134400,3,685,4.813559322033898

1529607,2,B00005JKWG,"kinda lame.

I like the sets, the sub had alot of details that looked to be historically authentic.  Even when one character used a 1940's submarine sink it added alot to the realism of the movie.

Spoiler alert:
Its basically the same movie as Abbott and Costello Meets the Haunted House.  Equipment has a mind of its own.  Ghost-like people appear in the passageway.  Something whispers ""Go Back"".
Is the ship being made to pay for past evil acts?
Who's telling the truth?
In the end, big surprise, everyone dies except the pretty girl they rescued at sea and a couple of other guys. They sail away wondering about what happened.",1404172800,,631,4.63963963963964
1529608,3,B00005JKWG,"A nice departure from the typical Das Boot type submarine movie.  I enjoyed it but they weren't completely successful in dispelling reality with the whole ghost on the submarine theme.  Technically sound.  The scenes inside the sub and on the surface are well done.

1529613,4,B00005JKWG,"This is a very good film that I missed when it was originally released. I'm glad a friend recommended it to me and that I finally rented it. Personally, I'm not concerned about ""mixing genres"" as ghost stories often occur outside of the classic haunted house.  The wartime submarine setting gives this story the necessary confusion about the cause of the ""bad luck"" the sub repeatedly encounters as well as it the claustrophobia lack of options to escape that a good ghost story requires to generate tension. The motivations of the characters that give rise to the events leading to the haunting make sense when they're finally revealed. It's a good film with a solid cast and script.

This time, the sub's captain mysteriously 'hits his head and falls overboard' after sinking a German Sub Tender (or was it a German Sub Tender?). Three survivors from the Sub Tender are picked up, and fun really starts in earnest. Mysterious deaths, phantom crew members, and a sub that refuses to obey the helm, all combine to raise the hair on the back of your neck. A great ghost story with a surprise ending.

It turns out that most of the DVDs being sold, including the one I purchased, are a 2011 re-release that, for some strange reason, does not include that feature.  I had to buy an original release from 2003/2004 on eBay to get that feature.  Just wanted others to know about that.  The one star off is for the DVD presentation only.

1529692,5,B00005JKWG,I have been searching for this movie but I didn't know the name. I saw it a long time ago and thought it was wonderful.

1529693,5,B00005JKWG,"I can't believe that I've never heard of this movie, which has to be up there with Hunt for the Red October in terms of best naval/submarine films out there.

Not only does the plot take some excellent and unpredictable twists and turns, but the suspense and action shots are incredibly nail biting. I honestly never had a slow moment or felt that the actions and plot points were forced.

Every character, major and minor (including a surprisingly serious Zach Galifianakis), is actually fleshed out surprisingly well and you'll grow to like many people and feel invested in the outcome of this movie.

Don't let me oversell this though, watch it for yourself and see if you loved the ride as much as I did!",1357430400,,708,4.648
1529762,3,B00005JKWG,"I bought this here on amazon from subvendor. It came in great shape it was used and came fast. The movie is good. It does a good job of any WWII movie out there. The thing is it was advertised as a scary moive. Well it is not that scary at all. It is a good thriller about conflict on a submarine.
Overall I give it a three and if you can get it below $6.00 buy it but not a $5.00.",1347494400,,381,3.658536585365854
1529763,5,B00005JKWG,"OK, Das Boot must be the greatest submarine movie ever made if you're going to stick strictly within the genre.  However, this film is a close second.  The depiction of life in a diesel-powered fleet sub in WWII is unmatched; the grime, the sweating pipes, the creepy, slowly-going-psycho crew members (my old man was on an aircraft carrier and my uncle on a destroyer, and they both told me that the sub crews were all mostly certifiable), and the officers trying to maintain some discipline and decorum.  If nothing else, get this film for the comments the crew members make as they pass the scuttlebutt forward about the three new people on the boat, newly rescued from a lifeboat - ""two teabags and a brillo pad....""

When you add a possible malevolent ghost to the mix the film gets really interesting.  This movie is essentially a haunted house story on a sub.  One of the problems with that genre is, in the back of your mind you're always thinking 'Why don't they just leave?'  Well, there's no escaping the ghost(s) in this movie!  It's a B movie, yeah, but it's a genius B movie!",1345334400,2,1089,4.577319587628866
1529764,4,B00005JKWG,"Give this thriller a chance that its creators didn't (they failed to hype this one up as they should have). A firm cast of good actors and steady direction guides this submarine movie, charting a course pulling you to the edge of your seat... a movie to be watched in a well-lit room only. It is essentially a ghost story, and a good one with some surprising twists. The producers of this fine flick went the extra step to make it look nice; there is an uncredited performer. The (real) submarine USS Silversides, a survivor from World War II, appears as the fictional USS Tiger Shark.",1341446400,,585,4.528301886792453
1529765,4,B00005JKWG,"2002's ""Below"" is a surprisingly good thriller that passed almost unnoticed through the box office.  The movie mixes drama, suspense, horror, and creepiness in equal porportions in what might have been a standard World War II action piece, but ends up being much more.

The movie is set aboard the USS Tiger Shark, a World War II submarine on patrol in the Atlantic in 1943.  When the Tiger Shark is diverted to pick up survivors from a sunken British hospital ship, a routine rescue mission goes badly wrong.  No sooner are three survivors, including a British nurse (Olivia Williams), installed below decks than the ship begins to suffer a series of mishaps and mysterious incidents.  The boat's captain (Bruce Greenwood) and his crew find themselves slowly losing control of the submarine and, seemingly, of their senses.  It will be left to the British nurse and one of the submarine's junior officers (Matt Davis) to figure out why, before everyone dies a horrible death below...

The plot gets feed to the audience in small dribbles; the emphasis is on an increasingly claustrophic atmosphere inside a dark hull, where things keep going bump in the night.  A solid cast of mostly B actors deliver a good show.  Alert viewers may guess the secret of the submarine before it is revealed on screen, but can expect to enjoy the movie as a unique type of closed house murder mystery.  ""Below"" is highly recommended as an entertaining and suspenseful flick, that probably deserved more attention the first time around.",1329004800,,1518,4.91764705882353
1529766,5,B00005JKWG,"Lots of dark, narrow corridors and a claustrophobic feel are what I got with this movie.  It is a ghost story set aboard a sub during World War II.  Several tense moments and a ""Did I see that?"" feel.
This is a ghost story and ghosts often want revenge.

1529769,4,B00005JKWG,"I really enjoyed this film and have watched it several times and showed it to a lot of friends: it's nothing more or less than a ghost story set on a WWII submarine. The quality of the filming and CGI, the script pacing and character delineation is not quite super Hollywood level but it's better than the usual straight to video fare by a long shot and way way better than the sort of lame retread ghost story we're getting out of Hollywood right now. It has a story, sets out the basic premise, then proceeds to tell its story in assured strokes with superb character work from every actor. The computer-generated graphics are not greatly advanced beyond high quality video game level but that's not really a problem and it's satisfyingly creepy and cool to look at.  Nothing here is going to shake your world but it's an agreeable way to spend a few hours and if you're a ghost story fan like me (not just 'horror'. Ghost story. Big difference), it's a great addition to the genre of mystery based haunting tales like the Changeling and the Others. Star Trek fans should note the lead actor is Bruce Greenwood who played Christopher Pike from the latest film, doing the great work he always does.",1313798400,3,1199,4.550925925925926
1529770,2,B00005JKWG,"I'm a vast fan of Darren but this screenplay is just not up to his other works. The entire cast is annoying, the thrills are hackneyed  tricks, (doors fly open with a blast with people suddenly standing there, etc).  I couldn't relate to or cheer for anyone, and it was disjointed, predictable, with a soundtrack that made it difficult to follow dialogue, and parts of the period just did not look period enough.  No thrills, no chills, and I just wanted to smack these annoying, annoying characters. Others may love this movie, I did not. But I know Darren cant be hurt by my little review.",1302048000,2,591,4.556603773584905
1529771,5,B00005JKWG,"Let me state that scary movies are not my favorite genre, but ""Below"" is just one great, old fashioned WWII submarine ghost story.  The use of an actual WWII submarine for filming adds a genuine authenticity to the movie.  Unlike modern creepfests that depend upon gore to surprise, Below builds anticipation and the surprises are both scary and laugh-out-loud funny.  The characters onscreen allow their imaginations to run wild and the viewer is swept right along.  The acting is first rate.  If you have a Navy vet who enjoys movies from the period, this is the movie to buy.

Lastly, the DVD transfer is one of the sharpest I've seen.  The 1.85:1 aspect ratio fills the widescreen and is almost as sharp as a BluRay disc.  If the movie is ever released on BluRay, this is one movie that does not need upgrading because the improvement would be miniscule.",1290384000,,858,4.7114093959731544
1529830,4,B00005JKWG,"It was the 1999. A young filmmaker has finished writing a submarine horror/thriller film. He is ready to turn the script into a film as his second Directorial effort. Instead, he will direct Requiem for a Dream, which will be held in high regard by many. This young filmmaker was named Darren Aronofsky and that film was called ""Below."" Instead, the script lied around until it was picked up by director David Twohy, and after a few re-writes, the film began production, modestly budgeted, with a very unknown at the time cast. Then as the film was ready to come out, it was uncerimonisoly dumped by the sudio. What, a film distributed by the Weinstein was crapped upon and sent out into the wild to breed? Shocking, I know. The result was a gross of six-hundered THOUSAND dollars. It was subsequently forgotten and now lives on Netflix Watch Instantly. So, is it any good?

The description of ""horror film"" doesn't exactly apply here. Below may seem cut and dry, and in some ways it is, but it's actually a mood-driven mystery thriller film set in a submarine, with some supernatural elements. Essentially, a submarine on the tail-end of its mission, the crew weary and on edge as all get out, picks up three Brits they were ordered to assist from a wreak, one of whom turns out to be a Nazi, who the crew quickly eliminates. It's about this point, unrelated to the Nazi mind you, that weird stuff starts happening. The crew starts seeing things, hearing voices, and the sub suffers a series of mechanical setbacks, all while the sub is being stalked by a German ship. Did I also mention that the Captain only recently became the Captain of the sub after the mysterious death of the old Captain.

Like I said, most of the film is based on mood. As the movie goes on, as the bad things start mounting, and the crew becomes increasingly paranoid, the mood just gets more and more dire. Plus, it's set in a sub, and the mood that comes from that is great. Sure, people die, and there is a little violence/gore, but the film is overall VERY minimalistic. The most grusome death shown is a guy swimming outside the sub without scuba gear on the bottom of the ocean, where the pressure kind of expands him. Also, a guy gets a hammer stuck in his face I think, but it's really brief. Nope. The mood is why you should watch this movie.

Also, the cast is pretty good considering how no-name most of them are, expecially in 2002. Zach Galifinakis is here in a somewhat substancial role (you can certainly reconize him from the beard), Scott Foley from TV's ""The Unit,"" Holt McCallany from the recent movie ""The Losers,"" Olivia Williams from various stuff (although she's the worst character of the film since she has a lot of annoying moments), Matthew Davis (who is actually pretty decent as the lead of the film) who played Warner from the film ""Legally Blonde,"" and of course, you have the great Bruce Greenwood being Bruce Greenwood. This is actually one of the more villainous roles for him, but he's perfectly fine, even though he's part of a reveal and last 10 minutes I just didn't really care for.

Overall, Below is certainly a film worth checking out. It plays with minimalistic horror a lot, and it strikes a very compelling mood, anchored (See what I did there?) by a suprisingly decent cast and script. It's not brilliant by any means, but it's certainly better than you'll expect it to be.",1286496000,,3396,4.589785831960461
1529831,5,B00005JKWG,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this.  I'd never heard of this film, so I had no expectations.  I was quickly drawn into this outstanding thriller.  For me, the film evolved as I was watching it.  At first, I thought it was going to be a war film, but before I knew it, it had become a ghost story, or better yet a claustrophobic thriller.

The viewer is trapped along with the crew in the middle of this submarine as a horrible series events unfolds.  This film is both stunning and riveting.  An outstanding cast, and great story make for a compelling film sure to be a cult favorite.",1284249600,,607,4.31858407079646
1529832,4,B00005JKWG,"Below is not a horror film.  If you are looking for a gory story, this movie is probably not for you. Below is more than anything else a very creepy, old-fashioned ghost story.  In WWII, a US sub is ordered to pick up three survivors from a torpedoed British hospital ship.  It soon becomes apparent that both the survivors and the sub's senior officers are harboring secrets. Some reviewers have complained that the film is boring. I've have seen the film three times and it consistently held my interest, even though I agree that the ending is somewhat predictable. What makes the film work for me is that it is a completely creepy and original ghost story and also a solid, action-oriented, WWII sub movie. I think both ghost story fans and submarine aficionados will find Below to be well worth watching.",1280880000,,808,4.676056338028169
1529833,4,B00005JKWG,"Director David Twohy (Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick) broaches several genres, in his unusual suspense thriller, Below (2002).  Part WW II submarine war adventure, part suspense thriller, and part horror film, Below features a supernatural presence aboard the American submarine Tiger Shark, on a mission in the north Atlantic in 1943.  It's an interesting blend, but one that doesn't totally satisfy in any particular area.

Wartime movies featuring submarines, are often prone to clichs, but this film largely avoids them, and introduces some new twists to the genre.  Falling depth charges, almost always mirror the course of the sub.  That is the case here, but there is a nice touch, where a depth charge tantalizingly bounces and rolls across the top of the sub, before falling over the side.  A new, scary ploy, is the use of hooks, to try and rip open or damage the hull.  This technique was actually used in the Pacific theater by the Japanese.  Also featured, is a trip to the void in between the inner pressure hull, and the outer sea hull.  Another doozy is an officer (Holt McCallany) exiting the sub, and trying to swim his way to the surface, before being harpooned.  But by far, the most dynamic development in Below, is the role that the buildup of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere plays.  In sudden dramatic fashion, the gas becomes responsible for the death of almost the entire crew!

Nurse Claire Paige (Olivia Williams), and second mate Kingsley (Dexter Fletcher), are survivors from the British hospital ship Fort James, rescued by the Tiger Shark, after being hit by a torpedo.  A third survivor, a German, is shot dead by Lieutenant Brice (Bruce Greenwood) the sub's acting commanding officer.  Brice has taken command after the mysterious death of Captain Winters, who drowned while the ship was surfaced looking for survivors after a kill.

Almost immediately strange things begin to happen, as a phonograph mysteriously blares out, causing a searching enemy destroyer to launch depth charges.  A crewman hears the corpse of the German speak to him.  Olivia, who has the propensity to stick her nose into everything, begins poking into the Captain's cabin and ship's log.  Then the destroyer is back, dragging the bottom with hooks, in another attempt to destroy the sub.  It's a very crowded ocean!

Misfortune and weird incidents continue to occur, an officer (Scott Foley) dies, as events build to a climax.  The crew has lost control of the ship, and it is headed back to where the Fort James was sunk.  After the hydrogen disaster, most of the crew is dead, and much of the sub is in dire condition.  As the supernatural aspects come to the forefront, matters proceed to a dramatic conclusion.

The whole vibe of Below, somehow doesn't ring true.  It makes for a nice drama, but the man don't seem to behave like real sailors, who understand and live by the military chain of command.  It's ridiculous, that there would be any tolerance for, any interference in the ship's operation by a civilian like Claire.  The ship's ensign (Matt Davis), engages in acts against command, conspiring with Claire and Kingsley.  Lt. Brice is also a piece of work, at times the headstrong commander, other times frozen and unable to act, forcing others to take action.  In the end, a nurse rises to superheroine status, while a shipfull of men with military training, look down, and search for their stones.  Dramatic yes, but is this realistic?

Twohy successfully creates a film that is deeply atmospheric, and at times frightening.  The special effects, particularly those related to the submarine, are very nicely done, and the story features some incidents that are new to the genre.  The overdramatic aspects, mostly related to Claire, wear thin as time goes on, but she's the one designated to feed the fires of doubt.  After a long journey, the ending is rather weak, and a bit disillusioning, as Brice suddenly decides to surrender his command.  While Below deserves some credit for being ambitious in scope, by doing so, it becomes more open to criticism.  Unrealistic though it may be, Twohy's effort does have its moments.",1273968000,,4156,4.920977011494253

1529836,3,B00005JKWG,"Below: 5 out of 10: Much like M. Night Shyamalan's The Village halfway through Below I had a horrible feeling of dread. There were many ways the plot could still go and nothing but atmosphere and build-up had taken place. Yet I became convinced that a lame obvious payoff was in my future. I was right.

Below tells such a simple straightforward story that the histrionics throughout the film seem even more overblown in retrospect than during the viewing. The movie succeeds on some levels, it has a nice Pitch Black homage, very good special effects and set design and it does create a spooky atmosphere with sounds all around you and slamming door and flickering lights. (Director Twohy throws so many fright clichs at you I'm surprised the submarine doesn't have a cat.)

The downsides, besides the disastrous ending, are more plentiful. Bruce Greenwood, playing the acting skipper, comes across as more of a fishing charter captain than a sub commander in wartime. And Olivia Williams, as the rescued nurse, plays cold so well that I was rooting for the only piece of eye-candy in the whole film to die, disappear or at the very least shut up.

All of this is a bit of a shame because take away the ghost story (and the endless bump in the night cheap scares that accompany it) you have yourself a pretty serviceable psychological thriller. On top of that the action scenes with the Germans attacking the sub are certainly tenser than any of the haunting stuff.

The men depicted on this sub would never be allowed into the miltary, especially around the time of WWII. How would it have hurt the story to have these men actually act like men?

1529913,5,B00005JKWG,"Below is an excellent horror film which I highly recommend!  It's also an often overlooked gem of a horror movie that's still out there for many future fans to discover.

The setting is World War II, in a U.S. submarine, at various depths in the Atlantic Ocean.  What else can one ask for in setting the stage for a voyage of supernatural scares?  Not much, I say.

Yes, Below is a great ghost story that very successfully delivers the scares, only picking up steam, as it dives to ever greater depths.  The story is genuinely creepy and even makes you look over your shoulders a few times for what else may be in the room with you.  It's also an original story, without the typical Hollywood plot holes in most films these days.  With all the predictable, clichd, and just-like-all-the-other movies out there, Below surely stands out in the fleet.  It has high production values, lots of style, great acting, excellent special effects, outstanding cinematography, and everything else you'd expect from a premium horror film.

Below is also a ghost story with a good deal of mystery and suspense, culminating in an ending with a twist that satisfies.  What's better is that all this claustrophobic horror happens hundreds of feet beneath the ocean, during a war, in a submarine, with some not-so-happy ghosts as crew!  It's bad enough when you have plenty of room to run.  However, all of that in a submarine is about as bad as it gets!  So, make sure you check out Below.

The acting is very good, as is the score, the sound design, production design, and the editing - this is not some slapped together mediocre low-budget movie. The producers are clearly sincere in their efforts to convey a meaningful story (with actual character development and solid themes), while keeping things very creepy. One of the best aspects of the story is that the viewer is never certain whether the submarine is haunted (what a great idea! Horror fans love those isolated settings!) or whether what the characters are experiencing is the result of  O2 deprivation or stress. My only complaint is that the viewer is likely to be ahead of the curve with regard to the mystery behind the haunting - I think the director drops a couple too many clues too early on; but this is a minor complaint.

As things unfold, we find that not everyone is as they appear to be. All of the action takes place in quarters and corridors so tight that it's difficult to move freely. I could feel the compactness and confinement on board as I watched! I'd never survive being on a submarine, even without the ghoulish goings on!

1529916,5,B00005JKWG,"An American submarine rescues the British survivors of an apparent U-boat attack, but that's not really the beginning of the story.  As the film moves forward, the story of the USS Tiger Shark comes into focus, and provides the backbone for an interesting and competent -- if not particularly suprising -- submarine ghost story.  Unlike a lot of modern ghost stories, ""Below"" isn't a gore-fest, and doesn't resort to cheap scares.  (To be fair, you don't HAVE to use cheap scares when your movie is set in a subarine.)

The cast is surprisingly good, and they're ably directed by the mood-light-loving David Twohy.  The supporting characters are appropriately colorful, even when they delve into the realm of cliche.  The script shows the touches of both Twohy and Darren Aronofsky, which is probably why it lends itself so well to the weird blend of realism and fantasy that this story demands.

Fans of the kind of suspense you only get when a film is set underwater will find a lot to love in ""Below,"" as will anyone who enjoys the occasional supernatural thriller.

1530000,3,B00005JKWG,"This film ws David Twohy's follow-up to the terrific PITCH BLACK, and he brought many of the same sensibilities to it.  Lighting was highly important.  The cast of relative unknowns got a chance to shine...mostly in roles dissimilar to any they had done before (Bruce Greenwood in a horror movie was new, I think.).  Banter and dialogue was fairly crisp, and a good sense of place was established.

Having a horror movie (or at least a tale of the supernatural) set on a WWII submarine during wartime was pretty darn original.  The claustrophobic settings lend themselves well to this venture.  On a submarine, it always seems like nighttime.  Also, because we've all seen submarine movies before, we know how dangerous they are, how bad depth charges can be, etc. etc.  You just can't beat scenes of sweaty guys in T-shirts running around trying to slam those steel doors shut and turn the locks to prevent water from building up, etc.  These kinds of scenes are almost clich&eacute;s now  (actually, not ALMOST...they are).  But they work.

The problem I have with BELOW is that we have what is essentially a 45 minute or 60 minute story stretched into over 90 minutes.  The story itself, the plot, is skimpy.  The ending, while a nice twist, isn't worth the wait.  I'm usually okay with slower pacing if it's in service of character or of understanding a situation better.  For example, to get WAY off track, the film ULEE'S GOLD is about a beekeeper.  It spends A LOT of time showing us the ins and outs of beekeeping.  This actually ends up informing our understanding of the actions Ulee takes later in the film.  In BELOW, the slow pace really only seems to stretch the story to movie length.  Lots of scenes seem repetitive or pointless.  We cover the same ground too many times.  The same arguments are made too many times.  (How many times CAN they force Olivia Williams back into her cabin!).

Everyone is fine in the movie.  The story is original.  The cinematography, lighting and art direction are just swell.  But it simply is too threadbare to sustain real interest and involvement.  I liked BELOW okay...and everyone involved is obviously skilled...but I can't enthusiastically recommend it.

I don't know whether BELOW can be classified as a horror, drama or mystery. Probably a mixture of all three. I didn't particularly find it scary (and I scare pretty easily) but as a drama and mystery it completly held my interest. It is atmospheric, the acting and directing is good. Another thing that I found impressive was the special effects. It wasn't over the top, as many movies these days are guilty of. The only thing I had a probem with was the ghost storyline.

1530003,4,B00005JKWG,"Going into 'Below', I didn't know what to expect.  I mean it was directed by David Twohy, director of two of the most meatheaded flicks starring just about the biggest meatheaded actor in cinema('Pitch Black' and its fecal-tinged sequel 'Chronicles Of Riddick').  But on the other hand, it was co-written by Darren Aronofsky, the writer/director of recent indy classics 'Pi' and 'Requiem For A Dream'.  So I didn't know if I was gonna get a meatheaded submarine action flick or a thoughtful yet slightly warped psychological thriller.  To tell you the truth:  you don't really get either...but 'Below' is still a pretty good little film.

The film goes a little something like this:  a US submarine is in the Atlantic playing a bit of cat-and-mouse with a German U-boat.  The US sub comes across the remnants of a sinking British hospital ship.  The sub's occupants find three survivors and bring them aboard.  And that is when the strange occurances begin...

First off, there's no real main character.  'Below' is an ensemble piece and everyone is brilliant.  The cast is filled with many faces you will recognize but may not be able to name:  Bruce Greenwood(from television's cult classic 'Nowhere Man' and various films), Holt McCallany('CSI: Miami'), Matthew Davis('Legally Blonde' and 'Blue Crush'), Dexter Fletcher('Layer Cake', 'Doom'), Scott Foley(TV's 'Scrubs'), Zach Galifiakis(standup comic and from TV's 'Tru Calling'), and quite a few cast members from HBO's 'Band Of Brothers'.  So whoever did the casting for this little low budget independant definitely deserves some praise for bringing together such a fine cast.

The plot and script are well done, though in the end leaves you with a lot more questions than answers.  The cinematography is excellent and the special effects are well done, considering the film's budget restraints.  All the perfomances are absolutely excellent and is by far the main reason to see this flick.  The only major complaint is that the film, set during 1943, just doesn't feel like it.  It feels like present day.  There's no dated lingo or pop culture references to really make it feel like a WWII movie.  If the filmmakers didn't tell you at the beginning what year it was taking place in, you might not realize that the film was set over sixty years ago.

But my one little qualm aside, 'Below' is a very good, involving, taut, little horror/psychological thriller that will be over before you know it and you will definitely enjoy.  Great performances and excellent behind the scenes work make this film one of the best movies that you haven't yet seen.  Definitely worth a rental and possibly a purchase.  Check it out.

And if you like this one, here's a couple more period piece horror flicks you might like:  'Dead Birds'(a Civil War-era film involving some Confedrate deserters/bank robbers and a haunted house they use for a hideout)and 'Deathwatch'(an atmospheric WWI horror flick set in the trenches).",1138406400,2,2962,5.039094650205762

It is a simple ghost story and does not rely on super-hoity-toity special effects to keep you interested.  The cast was a great ensemble and had they continued that great bond when they got together for the DVD commentary.

It's not too boring for the older crowd and not too scary for the kids [caution to parents - there is a nude heiny shot of one of the officers, but even this was done without being overly offensive].  The story keeps you on your toes without shoving ten tons of gore in your face.

Moreover, ""Pitch Black"" director David Twohy stepped in to lens the picture. Sounds great, doesn't it? There is as much talent in front of the camera as there is behind it, too. But putting all of that aside, isn't it great when someone makes a submarine picture? We just don't see enough of these movies today, or not enough GOOD submarine pictures. I suspect ""Das Boot"" sort of ruined the genre for everyone else--that, and the excellent ""The Hunt for Red October."" Once someone makes an excellent film in any particular genre, all other efforts must inevitably measure up or be considered a failure. ""Below"" contains many scenes found in other submarine films--the claustrophobia of life in a tin box beneath the waves and the horror of dodging depth charges are two examples that come to mind immediately--but the movie differs by adding a horror twist to the mix.

The troubles start when the captain of the USS Tiger Shark (the submarine in question) goes overboard after sinking an enemy vessel. Now commanded by Brice (Bruce Greenwood), the ship picks up three survivors from a sinking British medical ship on the way back to port. The crew of submariners, always a superstitious lot in the grand tradition of sailors everywhere, strenuously objects to picking up these survivors. Why? Not because they are hardhearted but because one of them is a female nurse and everyone knows a woman onboard translates into the worst of luck. Sometimes superstitions ring true. No sooner does Nurse Claire (Olivia Williams) arrive than weird things start happening. A German ship draws a bead on the sub and drops lots of depth charges, a couple of which seriously damage the submarine. Even worse, weird and unexplainable events start popping up with frightening regularity, for example the deceased captain's record player springing to life at the worst possible times. The crew starts to hear strange noises outside the vessel, noises that defy attempts to explain them away as whale songs or other predictable sounds. An assessment of the sub's damage confirms that hydrogen levels in the ship are rising to amounts that can cause hallucinations and paranoia. The boat is also suffering from an oil leak that threatens to destroy the engines.

At some point in the narrative, Brice begins to deteriorate mentally. So does the rest of the crew, several members of which begin to see odd reflections and shadows inside the ship. By the time a bunch of the guys have to don scuba gear and go outside to repair the leak the viewer comes to expect imminent disaster. Not yet, though. One more horrific event takes place that sends the crew of the USS Tiger Shark into paroxysms of fear: the sub begins to chart a course back to the scene of the sinking that resulted in the captain's demise. This is a problem on two fronts. One, no one set a such a course, which leads many to surmise that the ghost of the captain is definitely onboard. Two, the damage to the submarine requires immediate repair, which won't happen if the crew can no longer steer the vessel. Oh dear. Does a ghost genuinely haunt the USS Tiger Shark? Or is a much more human cause at the heart of the weird goings on? It's to the film's credit that we can never say for sure exactly what causes these creepy incidents. One thing we do learn is that Brice and a few other crewmembers share a few secrets about what really happened to the sub's captain, secrets that will inevitably come to the surface (pun intended) as disaster looms on the horizon.

I liked ""Below"" for several reasons. First, the performances are first rate. Greenwood gives a nuanced performance as Brice; it's a tricky role in that the actor can't suddenly turn into a raving maniac but must gradually reveal his character's mental deterioration. This Greenwood does effectively. Another welcome character is Weird Wally (Zach Galifianakis), who serves up necessary doses of comic relief whenever things get too weird on the submarine. Matthew Davis plays Ensign Odell, the obligatory hero character who eventually begins to question Brice's increasingly bizarre actions. ""Below"" also effectively uses CGI and sound effects to create a creepy atmosphere. And what an atmosphere! Think about it for a second--you can walk out of a haunted building, but where are you going to go when a spirit pops up on a submarine that risks attack if it surfaces? Exactly. About the only problem I had with the movie concerns the huge cast of characters. So many people step forward at various times that it is difficult in the extreme to keep track of them all. It's actually a small problem that fortunately doesn't interfere with the effectiveness of the movie.

A commentary track with Twohy and a few cast members, deleted scenes, a making of feature, and trailers for ""Dracula 2002,"" ""Halloween: Resurrection,"" ""Tangled,"" and ""Undisputed"" round out the disc. While I don't think ""Below"" ranks as the best horror movie made in the last few years, I do think horror fans should pay it a visit. Fans of submarine films will probably want to give ""Below"" a watch too.",1107907200,25,5432,4.818863879957128
1530219,4,B00005JKWG,"The only reason why I saw this was because the name Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream, Pi) was attached to it. Not as a director but as a co-writer and a producer. Sources say this movie was actually suppose to have been directed by Darren but he decided to do Requiem For A Dream instead, and for that.. I really can't blame him since Requiem For A Dream was one of my favorite movies. Anyway, the movie was done by the director David Twohy who is known for Pitch Black and for the upcoming Riddick. Even though I would have loved to see what Aronofsky could have done this movie, we don't always get what we want but even so, David Twohy did a good job with this little unknown film.

An extremely claustrophobic thriller that naturally takes place inside of a submarine with bunch of crew members who are hiding a dark secret. An American submarine in a middle of a World War II picks up two Brits and one of them just so happens to be a very attractive lady, Claire Paige (Olivia Williams, Sixth Sense, Rushmore). Naturally, with nothing but men in the submarine, problems arise with the the little lady who just wants everyone to get along. (The way the crew introduced the arrival of Claire Page into the submarine was absolutely hilarious by the way) Aside of this, the crew members start hearing horror like voices and seeing things they would only see in their nightmares. Little do they know that some of them are keeping a very dirty secret that will eventually take over them whether they like it or not, an unexplainable chain of events takes over the story and glues you to the screen.

I can already tell that I will be getting quite a few e-mails from visitors of this site, flipping out over the fact that I gave this movie a 3/5 star rating. Now I am no way saying this movie will be liked by everyone, I personally believe it was really good for what it promised. If you liked a certain thriller called Session 9, you will most likely enjoy this movie as well because they both focus on the mood rather than on the straight forward scare tactics approach that most horror/thriller movies focus on. By all means, it's not a scary movie, it's not a typical horror flick either, however, it is a creepy thriller that really got the short end of the stick as far it's release goes.

I think it is the characters (perhaps the actors) that I fiud so enjoyable. The film isn't terribly frightening, but who needs that? This is a ghost movie in the old style, much like the Sixth Sense or The Others. Probably the reason it gets mixed reviews is that people who expect a military action thriller are dissappointed with a ghost story, and people who want a pure ghost story are dissappointed with the military action. I found the combination much to my liking!",1094169600,5,645,4.47457627118644
1530221,2,B00005JKWG,"Below (David Twohy, 2002)

Twohy (Pitch Black) teams up with scriptwriter Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) and a crack team of fine actors, including Bruce Greenwood (Nowhere Man), Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Bruiser), Olivia Williams (The Sixth Sense), Matt Davis (Blue Crush), Sebastian Knapp (Jesus), Nick Chinlund (Con Air, The Chronicles of Riddick), Dexter Fletcher (Pandaemonium, Band of Brothers), and a host of others to show that even if you're the guy that directed Requiem for a Dream and the guy that directed Pitch Black and have a stable of top B-list actors working with you, you can still make a bad movie.

Okay, maybe ""bad"" is not the right word here. ""Depressingly mediocre"" is more like it.

I'm pretty sure anyone who's seen Das Boot and likes horror films has thought to themselves, ""man, wouldn't that be an excellent setting for a horror flick?"" Twohy takes a stab at it here, and to his credit he does manage some good shocks here and there. But the main storyline is incredibly predictable (as in it took me about three seconds after the setup to figure out what was going on), the pace is uneven at best, a lot of very good actors are wasted in minor roles, and, well, that's about all I can say about it. Could've been fantastic. Wasn't. **",1092614400,4,1299,4.713656387665198
1530222,5,B00005JKWG,"Sometimes cinematic success moves in mysterious ways.  Take the case of ""Below"" for example.  Dimension films basically pulled the plug on the box office run of this movie despite the fact that it's one of the most refreshing thrillers in the last few years, all the while horrible fodder like ""scary movie 3"" rakes in piles of dough.  Even in video stores, ""Below"" has been a sadly overlooked film and I'll never understand why.  How a film like ""Ghost Ship"" receives twice the attention this one did is beyond comprehension. The talent involved in the making of this movie is undeniable, the script written by Darren Aronofsky (PI, Requiem for a dream) and the film directed by David Twohy who has now helmed several entertaing genre crossovers such as ""The Arrival"" and the two ""Pitch Black"" films.

During world war II, a USS Tiger shark patrolling the Atlantic Ocean picks up the only three survivors of a torpedoed british hospital ship.  When the captain of the sub discovers that one of the three is a German he kills him immediately.  After this death, strange events begin to occur that lead the crew to believe that they might not be alone on the boat.  Not only do the USS crew have to deal with a sea full of German destroyers, but it appears that ghostly apparitions are haunting the USS Tiger Shark.

This film is a combination of war story and horror-suspense thriller.  It's not easy to combine the two genres and the genius of this film is how the film takes a wild turn when you least expect it: You think you're watching a war movie and forget what's buried under it, a horror movie.  The film is deftly paced, and scares you in all the right moments.  This didn't seem to be made on a huge budget but that actually helps this movie, as the filmmakers were forced to focus on story, character development and suspense instead of mindless special FX extravaganza like so many of today's blockbuster pictures.  Like in ""Pitch Black"" the cast is filled with solid, relatively unknown actors who seem ready for a big breakthrough.  I thought the actors did a great job at creating a sense of isolation and panic and I really wanted to see them pull through.  It's that kind of empathy that often makes or breaks a horror film for me.  If I don't care about the characters, then I won't care who gets picked off one by one therefore diminishing the experience.

This film is not without its flaws, although they do little to harm the picture.  First off, the notion that a trained crew of US soldiers could mistake a british ship for a German destroyer is absurd.  Second, the picture offers very little for war buffs to salivate on, as world war II is really more like a default setting.  The submarine Tiger Shark never existed and I've never read of any American submarines patrolling the Atlantic Ocean after July 1943.  So historically, the movie is complete fantasy but it must be beared in  mind that it was never intended as a historical war movie.  Reviewers who slam the film because of this are mising the point, as are those who try to place this movie on a measuring stick against ""Das Boot"".  I believe most people who did not enjoy this film were expecting too much from it, it should be taken as a suspense movie no more than that.  True, the story is a little hard to follow, but that's one of the things that makes ""Below"" a picture that stands so well to repeat viewings.  Darren Oronofsky has penned an excellent script with twists and turns that lead to a shocking final revelation.  More people need to see this movie.",1090800000,4,3555,4.55748031496063
1530223,4,B00005JKWG,"This movie slipped completely under most people's radar which is a shame because it is quite the entertaining kind of B-horror movie that they just don't make anymore. Dimension Films, for some reason, buried this film and now it seems to be enjoying a new life on video and cable (where I caught it).

The first strike against it is that it's a submarine movie. With the exception of Das Boot and The Hunt for Red October, sub movies are awful (K-19 anyone?). Below, happily, bucks the trend by expertly conveying the nightmarishly claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in a long tin can under tons of water. If that weren't enough of a problem, something creepy is lurking in and around the submarine.

The film features a really interesting cast of character actors. People like Bruce Greenwood (13 Days), Matthew Davis (Blue Crush and this film is the spitting image of a young Harrison Ford!), Dexter Fletcher (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), and Zach Galifianakis (TV's Tru Calling) to name just a few, are all excellent in this movie. It is a true ensemble piece, which is one the many things that makes the movie so enjoyable to watch.

The script by Darren Aronofsky and David Twohy is smart and yet delivers all the requisite thrills and chills needed. The attention to period detail is also good. I'm sure the filmmakers were working on a limited budget but they really do a good job in conveying the feeling that this is set during WWII. It is the little details, the personal items that each crewmember has that fleshes out the film and gives it dimension.

I can't say enough good things about this movie. It was really a pleasant surprise to discover late one night on TV. Definitely worth a look.",1090368000,3,1720,4.685430463576159
1530224,3,B00005JKWG,"'Below' is about a US submarine, patrolling the Atlantic during the Second World War, which picks up three survivors of a U-boat attack. Strange occurrences and mechanical failures begin to dog the crew, apparently linked to the recent death of the sub's commander, Captain Winters. The plot is an interesting twist on the standard ghost story, but contains a lot of stuff that will only be appreciated on repeat viewings. Since this movie sets itself up from the start as a popcorn flick, most of the target audience are unlikely to make the effort.

This movie was a disappointment to people familiar with the previous work of its writer and director. Pitch Black (dir. Twohy) was an underrated minor sci-fi classic that improved with repeated viewing. Pi (dir. Aronofsky) was an amazing first film effort, moody, quirky and confident, and obviously the product of a unique artistic vision.  This film, unfortunately, seems to have combined the least talents of the writer and director, rather than the greatest.  (I am not addressing the contribution of the third screenwriter Sussman, simply because I am not familiar with his work, and it seems fair to guess that as he was one of three writers, his contribution amounts to only a third of the final script.)

Who Are All These People?
How many characters are there in this film? Seems like at least thirty, and they each get at least a couple of lines, and most of them seem to be scenery-chewers. As a result the movie is confusing, as the viewer doesn't know which characters and storylines are important, and which are just there as background. This is largely resolved at the beginning of the third act, when most of the crew is eliminated, but of the remainder there are still two or three actors who have not been differentiated enough for us to tell them apart.

Stand Still, Damn It!
One thing I found initially off-putting about Pitch Black was its rapid intercutting of visually rich shots (what used to be called MTV-style, before it became the norm for movies). In that film the style eased off after a while, but in Below it seems the director is genuinely afraid of using any shot that lasts for more than one second. As a result, you can _see_ what's on screen (if you don't blink), but you never get to _look_. The problem with this approach, particularly in this kind of film, is that the viewer is never allowed to be afraid of what _might_ happen on the screen, because there is _always_ something happening. There is always a jump cut, or hand-held camera work, or something jumping out at you. Instead of feeling as though you're stuck in a cramped tin can with thousands of tons of water pressing in on you, you're more likely to feel you're stuck in an editing suite with a hyperactive teenager.

Oh, ""Boo"" Yourself
Another reason modern thrillers and horror movies aren't scary (he said, sounding older and grumpier by the minute) is the mechanical use of ""jolts"" and ""scares"". It's like a carnival ride: sure, it gets the heart pumping and produces an instinctive panic reaction, but it's purely mechanical, an automatic reaction. Your body is scared, but your mind and your emotions (unless you're pre-adolescent) remain untouched. Below is identical to other films of this genre in this respect. Things jump out or crash loudly at regular five minute intervals. Twohy actually reshot one of the earlier scenes because he felt it needed an extra scare. So now the cupboard looks spooky, and then some clothes fall out of it, but at this point in the film we don't even know that there's anything to be afraid of, so why should we care? More to the point, why should something jumping out at me in the final climactic sequence have any impact on me at all, when things have been going bang for no reason all the way through?

I could write a long essay comparing Below with the recently released (at the time of this review) Starship Troopers 2, which explores similar situations and themes. The latter film, with a fraction of the budget, is the more successful, because it largely avoids the problems I have examined above. I guess the criticisms I've made could be applied to hundreds of movies made in the last decade, and perhaps I'm a fool to expect anything exceptional, but, in terms of directing and writing talent, this movie had the potential to be much more than the usual collection of trailer moments. Can Twohy escape from the ""Hollywood slick"" style in his next project? (edit: no) Would this film have been better if Twohy and Aronofsky had swapped roles? One thing I'll give them credit for: they didn't resort to the ""last gasp"" shock at the end - anyone else would've had Captain Winters suddenly launch himself out of the sea at the end of the last reel, just so the hero could put a couple of bullets in him or set him on fire or something... Thank heaven for small mercies.

3 stars for technical achievement.

(End note: When Claire Paige was snooping around the captain's cabin, was I the only one who said ""Hey, she must be the Nazi spy they're looking for""? And what _was_ all that stuff about the hydrogen? I didn't follow that at all.)",1087430400,5,5145,4.682522123893805
1530225,5,B00005JKWG,"Here is an original and fresh venue on which to tell a ghost story:  a WWII submarine.  Submarines are already a bit spooky in the first place, by their very nature.  The present DVD takes all the ""regular"" bizarre traits of a sub and takes them all to a whole new level.
The story centers around an American sub that picks up 3 British persons, all of them survivors of the sinking of their ship.  From there on, things seem to continually go from bad to worse for the sub & her crew.  A strange sequence of events come to pass.  Some of them are explainable & some of them not so explainable.
The set design & direction does a good job of depicting the submarine as an underwater tomb.  Everything about the film is nice and eerie.  Although I've seen plenty of submarine movies, none of them have the chilling edge that this one has.
One of the most annoying motifs of horror /  supernatural films is at the end of the movie, when things seem to be ""normal,"" there is always the hint of the return of the evil / supernatural entity.  Thankfully, this present DVD omits that everpresent and aggravating trend.  At the end of this film we have 100% closure, which is in fact a breath-of-fresh-air in the horror genre.
If you're a fan of submarine movies and / or ghost stories, this is a unique film that's just for you.  After watching it, one thing becomes remarkably clear:  fighting the Germans in World War II was tough enough without having to deal with underwater apparitions on top of everything else!",1086912000,3,1510,4.447272727272727
1530226,4,B00005JKWG,"After being disappointed by so many thrillers ""Below"" benefited by exceeding expectations.  The 2002 film from director David Twohy (""The Arrival"") takes place during World War II and begins with the crew of the American submarine ""Tiger Shark"" picking up three survivors of a British hospital ship that has been torpedoed.  One of them is a nurse, Claire Paige (Olivia Wilson), whose presence aboard the boat is seen by some as signifying bad luck.  But it is clear that this sub already has been running on the down side since the depth of the captain.  The new commander, Lt. Brice (Bruce Greenwood) is jumpy, and apparently is telling the newcomers a story about the death of Captain Winter, and he is clearly not alone in hiding the truth about what really happened.  Right after the British are brought on board ""The Tiger Shark"" is attacked by a German ship, while makes Brice think that one of the three survivors in a collaborator.  Meanwhile, Ensign Douglas O'Dell (Matt Davis) is trying to make heads or tales out of everything that is going on, especially when things start to get creepy.
It is easy to say that ""Below"" is a combination of a WWII submarine film and a ghost story, especially since that is a pretty interesting combination.  But one of the things that makes ""Below"" work better than most ghost stories is that the possibility of there being some other explanation is quite strong throughout the film.  One of the things that Twohy takes advantage of is the role that sound plays on a submarine where you can hear just about anything from whales singing to a Benny Goodman record that suddenly starts playing when the sub is engaged in silent running to a German depth charge bouncing along the outer hull (a marvelously affective sequence).  Add to that your traditional oxygen deprivation problems from being stuck in a confined place, and who knows what is really going on at any moment.
Submarines are inherently claustrophobic environments and a submerged sub under attack is a natural for sweating inducing tension.  If anything Twohy studiously avoids going over the top, mixing up the touches of the supernatural with the various calamities that befall submariners, which you could say is erring on the side of caution.  As a result ""Below"" moves from being moody to being creepy, but without really getting terrifying.  Still, to be able to create and sustain a level of creepiness without the whole thing falling apart is pretty good in terms of contemporary horror movie standards.  The performances are notably on target across the board, especially  Nick Chinlund as the Chief, Jonathan Hartman as Schillings, and Christopher Fairbank as Pappy.  There is also a wonderful sequences where the crew explores the idea that the one thing that explains all the bizarre happenings is that they are already dead in what is one of the better ""Twilight Zone"" moments I have seen since the Zone shut down.
Check out the deleted scenes because the second one, the ""Hot Fish"" sequence, would have been really interesting to work into the film, especially since Twohy claims in the commentary that this was a real nightmare of U.S. subs during World War II.  On that basic alone you have to wonder why they would have cut it, even though the explanation given (that it threatened to make ""Below"" seem like it was more of an action film than a thriller) makes sense.",1083110400,5,3392,4.832469775474957

1530300,5,B00005JKWG,"A U.S. submarine encounters some really weird stuff in ""Below"", a very well-crafted film that I enjoyed watching very much.

Set during World War 2 in the year 1943, the sub starts encountering the strange occurrences after rescuing three members of a stricken vessel at sea.  There are some genuinely eerie and ""Gee, that WAS creepy!"" moments in this film.  The creepiest, for me, being a couple of different glimpses of a ghostly image, seen by the camera for just the briefest of instants.  Very effective.  (Be quick on the ""Pause"" button for these chilling moments in the movie.  On Freeze-Frame, they're even creepier.)

The movie's photography is highly stylish and effective, with great use of lighting, darkness, shadows, and some bright, bold colors on occasion.  One particularly-stunning moment comes early in the picture when we see the image of an approaching warship being reflected in the eye of the officer looking through the submarine's periscope.  This is another good place to utilize your DVD Player's Pause function.  And, due to the incredibly-clear anamorphic widescreen image we're treated to on this Digital Disc, it will pause with perfect clarity as well.

This DVD edition gives us some extra goodies, too -- definitely worthy of attention.  There's a director's commentary track, three deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and some bonus trailers. (I enjoyed the ""Sneak Peeks"", which feature trailers for other films. These ""Peeks"" are presented in booming 5.1 Surround Sound, as is the trailer for this film.  Nice!)

But my favorite ""bonus"" here is a short 12-minute featurette called ""The Process"", which shows several behind-the-camera clips from the film. Much of what we see in this bonus is rehearsal footage, which is then shown alongside the actual footage which ended up in the movie.  This brief featurette, like the film itself, exhibits very high production values.  It surprised me that they'd put this much ""stylish"" emphasis on a short twelve-minute bonus piece.  But they did....and it's a very nice little bonus on the DVD.

""Below"" is an intelligent, thoughtful, and realistically-spooky tale.  It's not ""over the top"", but it's not totally void of ghostly imagery either.  It's somewhere in between.  Darn good set of actors here too.  They are totally believable in their roles.

Bruce Greenwood, Dexter Flectcher, Olivia Williams, Jason Flemyng, Matthew Davis and the awesomely hilarious but wasted Zach Galifianakis as Weird Wally star. its not that horrible but it got boring after awhile and somewhat perdictable",1068076800,,365,5.203389830508475
1530305,5,B00005JKWG,"To be honest even though Below is not anywhere near a 5 star movie, I am going to give it that special treatment because it is streaks and bounds ahead of horror films that are currently been made these days.
Director David Twohy (Pitch Black) directs a script that Darren Aronofsky (Pi) has had his hand in to bring us a smart and downright frightening movie about a haunted submarine during WWII. Forget that pile of MTV Junk ""Ghost Ship"" and watch this vehicle instead.
The story is a simple one but there are plenty of twists, plot and scares along the way. Basically a submarine called the Tiger Shark is given orders to head back the way it came to pick up survivors that are drifting in the sea. After they do, strange mysterious things start happening on board the submarine while at the same time it is trying to evade the detection of a German destroyer. As the story moves forward you start to learn that everybody is keeping some sort of a secret and that there is a connection between some crew members and the haunting. Bad guys turn good and good guys turn bad and as a suspense piece you never know what is going to happen next. There are plenty of times in the film when you genuinely want to cover your eyes, or hide behind the sofa.
The other great thing about this movie is that it is crammed full of supporting actors in lead roles and you will have a lot of fun trying to put some of these faces to pictures that you have seen recently (Fight Club - Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels - Training Day... to name but a few.) The special effects are actually well done and even though a huge percentage of the special effects are CGI you will be hard pressed to notice it. In my opinion, this is a better submarine movie than the recent U-751 and a lot more suspense driven that I actually expected.
It is odd that Dimension films did very little in way of actually promoting this film. Maybe they felt that the story was not coherent or believable enough as a horror yarn to merit much advertising.. but then again we are talking about the same company that brought us the absolutely awful Dracula 2000 (with two sequels in the pipeline!). Okay the story does bend the rules of reality here and there but the acting is solid, the story is original and it looks visually wonderful enough to cast any flaws aside.
If there is any submarine horror movie that you would like to see then make it this one (probably the only one) and if you have seen this movie at the DVD rental store but don't know what to do with it, then get it next time because you will be in for quite a pleasant surprise.
It is rather very good after all is said and done. In fact I am now going to buy myself a copy of this little gem.",1065916800,4,2725,4.282945736434108
1530306,4,B00005JKWG,"When a US submarine is ordered to pick up survivors from an attack during WWII, eerie things start to happen on board the sub.  Crew members start to hear whispering voices or to see things.  The sub mysteriously changes its course which can't be corrected.  But, something's up with the officers.  What exactly are they hiding from the rest of the crew?
This is a very effective ghost story with great visual effects, a few gorey death scenes, and just an overall creepy atmosphere.  You get the sense of being trapped in the submarine, with its cramped quarters and tempers on edge, the periods of complete silence, and even suffer along with the crew when a German ship drops explosives all around them.  (A visually great sequence, too.)  Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy and some of the performances just manage to go overboard (no pun intended).  But the visuals and the story more than make up for that.
The picture quality of the DVD is fantastic, very crisp and clear.  Soudn quality is very good, too.  Not a lot of extras, but the deleted scenes are worth watching.  (I even prefer the ""Red Flare Ending"" to the original.)",1063584000,,1137,4.606965174129353
1530426,5,B00005JKWG,"""Below"" has got to be the most underated ghost film of all time.  Like it's title, this film managed to fly below movie radar screens which is unfortunate because it definitely delivers EVERYTHING that the over-rated and more commerically successful ""Ghost Ship"" was suppose to do.
Not only is the film scarier, it's suspenseful and totally believable.  You leave the film caring about the characters and saddened by some of their fates.  What I like best about the film is the way it underplayed scenes that other directors would have easily exploited.  The script is well-written and well thought out.  Finally, a ghost film made with intelligence!
The one disappointment that I had with the film was the lack of recognition during the Academy Award ceremonies.  I thought for sure the film would get nods in the technical categories...especially in sound, sound editing, cinematography, art direction, film editing and original screenplay.  The sound, especially, has a life of its own in this film and is a crucial element in this film.
If you're looking for a film that stands above the crowded sea of disappointing ghost films (The Haunting, Ghost Ship, etc.), I suggest you scratch 'Below' the surface and give it a viewing.  You won't be disappointed.",1062460800,2,1259,5.019230769230769

But as it nears the end the story falls into incoherence and suffers from obviously deleted scenes. If the script were tighter then this film could have been great as David Twohy's direction is not really to blame.

He creates a unique atmosphere and nice underwater  visuals that give the film an original look. I just wish that the horror/spooky aspect of the movie were stronger. When the ghosts appear they do so in a genuinely creepy way that seems 'realistic'. It's these parts of Below that I like but it gets way too silly towards the end. The cast is unusually solid with the exception of Olivia Williams, who is horribly miscast and fails to make any connection with the audience or bring her character to life.

The DVD is sports a powerful Dolby 5.1 soundtrack with a great looking 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer.",1062201600,4,940,4.644578313253012

You really feel the same way that the characters should be feeling at the same moment.  You feel confused and scared.  The whole movie is covered in eerie goo.  The movie is practically dripping with it.  There is a little bit of a plot to figure out that lends itself to explaining why things are as they seem to be.  But, then again, are they?  Does any of it happen?  Or, is everyone suffering from guilt and letting their minds play games with them?  I don't know, nor will you, but you will be just as confused as they are in the movie and that is a good thing.  This will disturb and scare you.
Far better than Ghost Ship is.  But then again, what movie isn't better than Ghost Ship?",1061510400,,780,4.195945945945946
1530429,3,B00005JKWG,"A ghost story set within a submarine?  What a novel idea!  I mean...being inside a dark submarine is kind of creepy as it is, right?  Add in a touch of mystery, suspense, and horror (equal parts) and you have yourself a movie.  It helps that Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream) helped write and David Twohy (Pitch Black) skillfully directs it.  Plus, Bruce Greenwood (13 Days) delivers another understated performance that will make him an actor to watch in the coming years.  But he doesn't steal the show, as all of the actors do a wonderful job.  Those expecting a horror movie will be disappointed because this is more of a mystery with horror elements.  The mystery involves who is haunting the ship and why.  The movie moves at a nice pace and is not overly long, which sabotages some submarine movies in my recent memory.  But the scares are pretty much pedestrian: people all of a sudden appear surprising a character, eerie sounds, etc.  There is one very effective scare tactic involving a mirror that makes a crew member go crazy.  I probably would have too had it been me looking into the mirror.
 This movie should have received more attention before hitting the video stands and hopefully will get more attention now.  There are not a lot of extra features, but those that are on the disc are very well done.  For instance, the deleted scenes are kept to five (instead of feeling like you are watching yet another movie) and the documentary is presented in a very unique way.  We get to see setting up the scenes and the actors caught on videotape, but it's the presentation that sets it apart.  A diagram of the sub is shown and the camera travels to different areas of the sub to show what scenes were shot where.  It always confuses me how subs are laid out, and this helped to some degree.",1060732800,,1814,4.546296296296297

There is NO computer graphic or any special effect in this film. You can see all crews from the beginning to the end very scared of nothing. I say nothing because there is nothing in the sub(no ghost at all). Just another psychological drama(poorly made)! Don't buy its DVD, or it'll be waste of money!",1059177600,6,427,4.417721518987341
1530431,5,B00005JKWG,"If you like ghost stories (as distinct from slashers), this is a great movie. It is obvious that director David Twohy loves the movie-maker's art; he has a splendid eye for good shot, and, most importantly, he develops characters that you care about - which makes it all the more terrifying when they are in danger. It should be obvious that good characters are the heart of a movie, but it seems like character development often takes a back seat to special effects these days. Twohy uses his movie-making toolbox - special effects, music, angle, lighting, and set - to enhance his actors and dialogue, rather than eclipsing them. The movie still hangs on the flicker of an eyelid, an annoyed glance, or a look of absolute terror - not on how cool the explosion was.
Twohy also explores the masculine world - whether consciously or unconsciously, I don't know. Either way, it is refreshing. Masculinity traditionally was fairly clearly defined in the movies. Lately, it seems to be a problematic topic - as if masculinity is dangerous and must be apologized for by making sympathic male characters boyish, charming, and aw shucks (at any age), and unsympathic ones psychopathic. Movie men used to be far more complex! I enjoyed Mr. Loomis's powerful masculinity in this film (played by Holt McCallany), and was fascinated by Mr. Brice's weakness (played by Bruce Greenwood). Neither were boyish or psychopathic - they were both grown, powerful men. That dangerous edge made the movie far more fun. It's the same sort of energy that made Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) in ""Pitch Black"" so interesting.
I'm confused about why this movie wasn't released more widely. I looked for ""Below"" at the theater, but couldn't find any evidence it ever came to Oregon. I researched Mr. Twohy's past movies, and found one from 1992 (""Grand Tour - Disaster in Time"") that they shelved and didn't release until after ""Pitch Black"" did so well. The reviewers of that movie said it was great, and expressed confusion at the decision not to release it. And ""Below"" came out after ""Pitch Black"" - a very successful movie - which makes their poor advertising and limited release all the more mysterious.",1057017600,,2184,4.873655913978495
1530432,3,B00005JKWG,"It is not often that Hollywood combines horror with war since the result is often to confuse the audience into blanching at the horrors of war or the horrors of the supernatural.  Each is horrible in its own right.  But in BELOW, director David Twohy creates a tale based on incremental images of fear.  During the second world war, an American submarine picks up three survivors of a U-boat sinking of a hospital ship.  One of the three is a woman who acts as a catalyst for the crew to re-examine the events that led to the recent death of the submarine's captain.  As the woman discovers the truth behind his death, so does the audience, and it is at this point that spooky things begin to occur. However, these spooky things are not all that spooky. One of them, at least is laughably derivative.  Fans of I LOVE LUCY will remember the scene in which she dresses as Harpo Marx with the real Harpo staring at her as if from a mirror.  Lucy mugs and bounces with Harpo trying to keep up, but always a milli movement off.  In BELOW, there is a similar scene in which a crewman peers into a smoky mirror with his reflection taking on a life of its own. For a film that is clearly meant to be bordering on the paranormal, this mirror scene is as spooky as it gets.  Yet, director Twohy manages to keep suspense flowing by virtue of the calamities that often beset submarines in war films. There is an abundance of noises, explosions, burst pipes, flooded compartments, and sailors cracking under pressure.  The ghost-like elements in BELOW could easily have been eliminated without sacrificing any attendant suspense. What emerges at the end is a confused ending to a military mission that on film at least is not nearly as spooky as both cast and crew had so clearly striven for.",1055635200,,1779,4.514018691588785

Good acting, cinemetography, sound, music, & special effects coupled with this previous revelation, and you get ""Below"", a truely entertaining and suspenseful thriller!

1530434,3,B00005JKWG,"David Twohy is king of the b-movie thriller. He's directed a number of strong genre films on tight budgets that have been both visually innovative and startlingly powerful. The Arrival and Pitch Black are his two best known films and Below fits somewhere between the two of them. Visually, this haunted submarine story is about has sharp as they come. He's managed to inspire inspired performances from his under rated casts (everyone from Charlie Sheen and Vin Diesel have benefited from his solid direction).
In this quick to video age, the art of B-movie making and low budget genre films had been lost until recently. The last director capable of creating anything worthwhile before Twohy was Sam Raimi. His Evil Dead films had a crackling energy and sense of humor most mainstream films would have benefited from in the 80's and 90's. Likewise, Twohy's films have all the visual splendor and energy missing from mainstream genre films over the last ten years. Minority Report and AI, for example, would have benefited from Twohy's action direction and lack of pretense. He tells a solid story and tells it well.
It's a pity that Below was buried in the theaters before it got a chance to surface. The acting is top-notch and, while the script is certainly flawed, it's attempt at merging a variety of different genres is admirable.
The DVD transfer is handsome and the extras extensive given the small audience the DVD was intended for. The sound is equally detailed and, while not presented in the DTS format, sounds great. I'd like to add that the technical information mentions the film is presented in standard format (i.e., a television aspect ratio)when, in fact, it's in a widescreen format.

Frankly, I rented Below from the library and it was due back today, so I began watching it last night at midnight, giving myself the option to turn it off if I was bored. I never was.
What impressed me most was the emphasis on suggestion rather than gratuitous violence - a refreshing change from the usual movie fare these days. Several other reviewers have mentioned mood. In fact, mood plays such a big part here that it almost upstages the actors. This is actually okay because what is required of these actors is tough to pull off - ""authentic"" human response to weird and unexplainable stuff.

At first you get the feeling that the movie can't decide what it wants to be - war? mystery? ghost story? horror? submarine hunt? Then you realize that it WANTS to be all those in one. And it does a very good job of being ALL of them.
There are some excellent, VERY brief visuals in the movie that contribute to the sense of unease and otherworldly. It's the best representation ever of the feeling that you can only catch a glimpse of a ghost out of the corner of your eye.
The sound design (as with just about any submarine movie) is excellent and story-critical. The acting is top-calibre from a relatively obscure cast (Bruce Greenwood, Olivia Williams, Matthew Davis, Holt McCallany, Scott Foley, Jason Flemyng, Nick Chinlund). The film is co-scripted by Darren Aronofsky (""Pi"", ""Requiem for a Dream""). Director Twohy puts in a cameo appearance.
The DVD exhibits one of the cleanest, clearest pictures I've ever seen (in my collection of 1000 DVDs). It rivals the transfer of a more obvious reference disc like ""Monsters, Inc."". The sound, although not DTS, is terrific, and you'll want to turn up the volume so you can hear everything from the hull noises to whispering voices.

Below was pretty interesting and I was never really bored, which is definitely something considering I don't like submarine movies. I'm usually bored by them, but not this one. Of course, the slight horror element certainly helped, but even when it wasn't going the horror ruite it was still interesting.

1530615,2,B00005JKWG,"First, let me comment on the DVD...  great picture, no real problems with contrast despite the fact this is a dark film, and good quality audio....
About the film...  I was disappointed.  The submarine is accurate, but beyond that this film is not much of a military thriller.  The military plot is purely secondary to the ghost story involved in the film, and in my opinion the ghost story was predictable.  Regarding the military story, a US submarine is on patrol in the Atlantic when it is ordered to pick up survivors from a torpedoed boat.  One of the survivors is a woman, something that is supposed to bring bad luck to the boat crew.  Sure enough, things start going wrong (to strange) almost immediately after the people are rescued.
Regarding the military plot, the boat is stalked by a German destroyer for a long period of time.  At one point, the sub is resting on the bottom of the sea trying to avoid detection.  Where is this?  I don't know one place in the open Atlantic that is shallow enough, and the boat is supposed to be within a few days of England.
At another point, there are divers outside the sub trying to fix a problem, and in the very distance you can see flashes and concussions from depth charges...  well, if the charges were close enough to see they would kill the divers, and if they were so far away you could see them but not hear them.  So much for realism....
OK, its a movie.  You should suspend your disbelief.  Regarding the ghost story, I thought it was strictly boiler plate.  This is a story that could happen almost anyplace, and the sub was chosen just for its novelty.  It does add a certain amount of claustrophobic atmosphere, but beyond that I found the story a little predictable.  Worth a rental, but not spectacular....  trust me, while the acting is good and the atmosphere and setting a bit novel you have seen this film before, just with a different skin.",1048464000,3,1913,4.511627906976744

This was not a simple task considering the studio dumped the film therefore limiting its release and I had great difficulty finding a theater in driving distance. However, all my trouble was rewarded once I saw the film. First off the WWII submarine aspect is very historically accurate(much better than U-571), having been to see the WWII sub at the museum at Battle Ship Cove in Fall River Mass., and doing some research on the web I can vouch for the autheticity of the sets. Second the film is a military thriller, an action/adventure, a mystery, and horror film all rolled into one. Due to the combination of these genres this movie has a uniqueness not topped by anything I had seen in 2002 or this year so far. The acting is great, the dialogue is of the period and so much fun, and the story is totally ingrossing.
It was such a shame that Dimmension studios dumped Below, after all it would have knocked GhostShip right out of the water (no pun inteneded). The time for the release was perfect right around Halloween but due to little or no advertsing and studio support a great entertaining film was missed by so many people. I only heard about the movie from reading Entertainment weekly and even then I had to look for the trailer online. What a shame.

Thought that the ending could have been a bit better, but it's generally a tough thing to get an awesome ending these days. Also, the one thing that I really had trouble with, was the fact that for a sub, this one sure was pretty immaculate and sterile. Needed more noise from the steel, that sort of thing. Subs generally groan and expand/shrink in varying water temps. But, that is a bit nitpicky for this definitely must see rental!!!

Two scenes standout as a grand testimony to the direction of David Twohy.  1. Gossip of a female on board travels among the sailors from one end of the boat to the other.  2. A depth charge bounces slowly along the stretch of the sub before teetering on the edge...and we watch in complete suspense.  As for the DVD, the transfer is crisp, the audio is incredible (as creaks and moans play an important role in the film), and the special features are good.  You get a theatrical trailer, a director and actor's commentary, and a great featurette titled ""The Process.""  A wonderful look into the filmmaking process we watch how rehearsals come to be the real deal.  Running only 12 1/2 minutes, I wish it were longer.  And 3 really good deleted scenes round out the package.  The movie spent a minute in theaters--hopefully it will catch-on in the DVD format.",1047600000,12,1132,4.544554455445544
1530620,4,B00005JKWG,"An effective movie that was extreemly well lensed, BELOW is one of the better submarine movies out there.  Tense and claustraphobic, this story of WW2 submariners dealing with supernatural happenings hits the mark with some erie momments and cool visuals.  The very end of the picture has some silly scenes that could've been better orchestrated, but other than that the film is solid- it moves quickly and with purpose.  The DVD is very good and the sound on the disc and in the film is nothing less than awesome.  A great scary movie for late night viewing.",1047513600,,559,4.731958762886598
1530621,5,B00005JKWG,"All the positive reviews are right....this is a great genre film.
But it's not the pitch perfect subtle horror....or the best underwater action since Hunt For Red October. Or even the very deftly done cinematography.  It's the superb acting done by an ensemble cast. Each character is a real, multifaceted, human being. The cast works together so well you imagine they must have rehearsed for months....there is not a ""wrong"" moment on screen.....a master script!
The releasing company buried this great film...and if it wasn't for the reviews I read on Amazon...I might have missed it.
Thanks to everyone who writes a review....good or bad!",1047513600,,641,5.104761904761904
1530622,3,B00005JKWG,"This was a god movie but not a great movie either. It had a good creepy atmosphere to it, a nice original story line. Yes, the actors and actresses where very good for no-namers. The picture quality and sound was very good. My only problem was I thought the movie was a little too slow, and it needed way more monsters/ FX/ something! Anything. Is it possible to have too much story line?, I think in this case the answer was yes. For reference, I thought the same thing about the Haunting: Needed way more action! Definitely worth seeing though. (Note, if you class being bumped around inside the submarine when depth charges are exploding around you, also similar to star treks enterprise getting hit by torpedoes and the over dramatized reaction of the crew members, The YES this does have action)",1047427200,,800,4.640845070422535
7940782,5,B00005JKWG,Great suspenseful movie.  It is a thriller that is well done.  It doesn't rely on guts and gore but on creating a suspenseful atmosphere with a lot of questions about what's really going on.  I liked it.  Would watch again.  Glad there is substance in a movie again.,1522540800,,266,4.458333333333333

7940784,3,B00005JKWG,"Pretty much your standard ghost story with the submarine providing the claustrophobia usually introduced by being locked in a house/apartment/warehouse/etc.  Technical difficulties with some of the plot items such as leaving the ship while submerged (should have been hypothermic in minutes) or worrying about batteries producing hydrogen (unless I'm mistaken, that only happens while charging the batteries NOT when running on them).  However, some good jumps and they hide the ghost well until the reveal.  I didn't really care about any of the characters surviving once the story had run its course  ;)",1506729600,,605,5.473118279569892

7940786,2,B00005JKWG,"You have seen this story a million times. There is nothing new and no new twists. It is just a strait forward ghost story that just happens to be on a submarine instead of a hotel or in a bayou. It is still fun to watch this rendition.

A US Sub in WWII picks up a life-boat with three passengers. There is something suspicious about the passengers and their situation. While we are keeping our eyes on the life-boat passengers, we come to realize that maybe they are not the suspicious ones here. Is some insidious force out to get revenge or set things straight?",1504396800,,564,4.371428571428571

7940791,5,B00005JKWG,Saw this movie some time ago and it really made me think about what could happen during a war movie that deals with the supernatural as this one does.  A war movie with a horror flick genre mixed in.  Absolutely brilliant if you ask me.  I rate this movie very highly and it really makes you think.....,1473465600,,302,4.2631578947368425
