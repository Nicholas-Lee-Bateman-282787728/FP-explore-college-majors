8721818,1,B010CG2G76,"A guy named Paul (Paul Wheaton) is running around in daylight wearing a Marmot jacket and pink ski mask. He is killing people and no one can figure out who the serial killer is other than a couple of kids who go after him. They also have bad nightmares as filler material.

This film was horrible. The sound and camera was amateur. I would say this looked like a high school project, but that would be insulting to high school projects. The dialogue was a laugh, in fact Joshua Bruce laughed as he did his ridiculous lines. The scenes have lots of fake blood and very fake looking body parts, i.e. the type you can get at a Halloween store.

Guide: F-word. These guys don't know any women, so don't look for any. Worth one punch on a hacker's card.",1456704000,,748,4.335714285714285
8721819,1,B010CG2G76,"I'm always in the mood for a fun B-horror movie, so when I found this film at a video store, I was sure I had stumbled upon a hidden gem. The DVD was presented with a stylish cover, and the description said it was an homage to '80's slasher films, so I figured I couldn't go wrong, but when I put in the DVD, all I saw was cheaply-made, poorly acted garbage. This is as amateurish as you can get, folks. It's like some guy decided to make a film just for fun with his friends, and then a studio discovered it and decided to sell it to the public. At the most, Creeps should be available on YouTube for free and nothing more, but having people pay actual money for it should be considered robbery. The performances are cringe-worthy, the camerawork is very poor, and the effects are laughably bad. I'm not saying it's wrong to make a movie as a fun project, but with production values as low as those in Creeps, it's wrong to have anyone pay to see it. Oh, and the killer wears a pink ski mask. Still want to see it? You'd better not.",1455926400,,1033,4.17
8721820,3,B010CG2G76,"I want to say right from the start that Creeps won't be a movie for everyone. As a matter of fact, it probably won't be something most people enjoy. But if you do in fact love shot on video horror film, or if you just like indie movies with a shoe-string budget, then youll not only be right at home, you may even like this. Yes, there are scenes when they could have stood to have done another take. There are moments when they could have clipped the start or ending of a scene to edit out the obvious break of character from the actors, but the movie has heart and that shines through regardless. See, I don't take a movie like creeps as a movie where some kids just decided they wanted to run around town and make a bad movie for the sake of one. I take this as a movie by some folks who love these kinds of movies and they actually put forth some effort in mimicking them, and you can tell they are having fun while doing it. You cant just fake stuff like that, regardless if you shoot on video or HD. These are movies you simply get or you don't and these guys not only get it and give you their own version of one of those movies, they put forth effort into it and it makes it a very watchable movie for what its worth.

One other thing I found very interesting about this one was the plot. It is such a strange and weird one, but thats the charm of it. Im sure some folks might get lost in it a bit if you don't follow along and put some of it together yourself, but this one bounces in and out of dream sequences, and just gets stranger and stranger the longer the movie goes. I sorta dig that. The movie has parts of it that are so odd or awkward that it reminds you a whole lot of THINGS, perhaps the only movie out there of this nature that will rival this in its strangeness, but this one doesnt top it, it just reminds you a whole lot of it. Overall, if you like cheap effects, cheap looking movies, but movies that still have a lot of heart and love for the genre put into them, then Creeps is one you do need to check out. It also has a great cover as well as you can see.",1451347200,2,2087,3.992822966507177
8721821,1,B010CG2G76,"Worst movie of the year candidate. These youngsters have a ton of heart and their intentions come from the right place. But I can't in good conscience recommend anybody watch this. And unfortunately that's the job I have. To tell fellow movie nuts whether they should spend their time and money on a particular film.

The score is the best part of the film and that's not saying much. I will see they are at least self aware they're making trash and not one effect is believable or funny. Plus the other highlight is we get to see half of a Citizen Toxie poster on a kids wall. I applaud the effort boys but I was really happy when the movie was over so I can move on to the next horrible 2015 horror movie.",1446681600,,707,4.237037037037037
