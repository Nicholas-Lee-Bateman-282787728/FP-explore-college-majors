8302030,1,B001FFBI6Y,"The enticing trailer featured a sequence that was actually in the 'writer's' imagination, so the scene in the trailer was not a scene from an actual act in the movie.
Consequently all the enticement vaporized and the movie proved to be a complete waste of time.
Two cute chicks but they stayed clothed all the time!",1330560000,,315,4.642857142857143
8302031,3,B001FFBI6Y,"I've seen parts of this now a couple of times and just caught the ending.  It's actually an okay movie and if I'm not wrong, the last scene there seems to indicate the none of the events actually happened.  The guy was never kicked out of his house .. never in the apartment living with the two girls and ""writing about writing"" etc.

Instead, he and his wife are happy at home, and the entire movie has been the guy sleeping on his own couch to come up with the ideas for everything we've seen in the movie up until the last minute or so when he returns to bed and has that last conversation with his wife.

So in effect, he's been writing about a guy who is kicked out of his house and forced to live with two girls where he writes about them, writing about him.  Or something like that !!!

Anyone else get that impression ?  Kind of a clever end that way.",1297296000,,859,4.107784431137724
8302032,4,B001FFBI6Y,"This movie will appeal to those who've lived college life in the dormitory, or sharing apartment space.  It sure reminds me of how much I miss those fun times with roommates, especially coed situations.  Unlike most college movies, this one is not about fraternities, partying, or goofing around.  It's a slower paced, day to day activity that's realistic, dealing with studying, stresses of exams, and campus, rather than flamboyant dramas.  This low budget production goes hand in hand as this genre is driven by the atmosphere, characters, and layout.  Lizzy Caplan and Izabella Miko play their student roles well beyond carrying a backpack.  Campbell Scott plays a depressed but accomplished published novelist who ends up crashing at these girls' place in exchange for tutoring in literature.  My only complaint was that the very last end scene was a bit far fetched (exaggerated) and made to appease the Hollywood concept.  Don't expect much from this flick, but it's worth it for any college grad.",1295395200,,1004,5.116564417177914

The arrangement lasts beyond the first night as Richard promises to assess the women's writing in exchange for his spot on the couch.

Richard repays his hosts' kindness by reading their e-mail, using them as templates for his newest novel, and fantasizing about having a more intimate relationship with them.

To me, ""Crashing"" was a mildly entertaining diversion but little more. Richard is so self-centered that he failed to engage me, and the two women, as extensions of Richard's fantasies, are not allowed to develop their own personalities. Too often, the dialog seemed affected, as if in an effort to be ""Literary"" (with a capital L). There is a good story here, but for the most part, it is not allowed to develop.

For those who are interested, the film's R rating is attributable to drug use, language, and sexual situations.",1229472000,12,1860,8.152709359605911
