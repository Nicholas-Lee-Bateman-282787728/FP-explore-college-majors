I plan to watch them in sequence so in addition to enjoying the story telling I can also observe the evolution of the film making.  So far I've only watched a couple of the older films (e.g. All Quiet on the Western Front) and I was pleased with the quality of the video capture on the DVD, much better than I expected for a film that was shot 80+ years ago.

I know a lot of people complained that no one person would enjoy all the movies because the movies are so different from each other, but my husband and I are seriously enjoying the variety.  We get a lot of guests staying with us and I'm sure everyone one of them will find a movie they would like to watch.  The movies are very good quality with no problems so far.  We can't say enough about how much we are enjoying the movies.",1442793600,6,542,4.213592233009709
5190860,4,B008YB9346,"Though when this set was offered as a deal of the day recently I had to snap it up. However I do agree with a few of the previous reviews of this collection about what is here and nit here, First for us serious collectors of films we will already have Universal's recent Spielberg collection so you will already have three of the films included in both (Jaws,Jurassic Park & ET) I understand why they are here so that the set could appeal to younger collectors. However I would have liked to know why there are more 80's and 90' s films than older ones. For example why no Lon Chaney? Yes I understand that silent films may not be every one's cup of tea however Chaney was Universal's top star in the 20's and his exclusion is a crime. However I agree with many of the other reviewers here Frankenstein should be here with Dracula. Next Why no WC Fields?, Fields made most of his best features at the studio(The Bank Dick, My Little Chickadee and You Can't Cheat an Honest Man ) His exclusion is also a crime. Next why no later Rathbone Sherlock Holmes? they were Universal's bread and butter until the rise of Abbott and Costello (at least we get one of their best films though I prefer A & C Meet Frankenstein better) The one film that's excluded from this set is the one I understand the least. It's 1970's Airport (though we do get Alfred Newman' s main title on the CD). It was the studio's biggest grossing film of the early 70's and helped kick-start the disaster film cycle. There a few other films that I would have liked to see here  first the  1936 Show Boat. Its much better that the MGM version was and has most of the original cast including Helen Morgan and Paul Robeson. Next The King of Jazz the studio's first all star film(band leader Paul Whiteman and an early performance by Bing Crosby) and it's first Technicolor all talkie. Then William Powell and Carol Lombard in one of the best comedies (a genre sadly lacking in this set) of the 30's My Man Godfrey. A Ma and Pa Kettle film would have been nice too (but no too welcome in these overly politically correct days) then we could also have one of Donald O'Connor's Frances the Mule films as well as Ronald Reagan's classic flop Bedtime for Bonzo as well)and lets not forget one the Tammy films either. Thoroughly Modern Millie is another one I would have liked to be seen here, it's simply screaming out for a bluRay release. Finely there should be Eastwood film here as well. I know that most of the studios westerns were mere Saturday afternoon matinee fodder Eastwood who has spent most of the early part of his career at the studio also deserves a place in this set I know that we could argue what is here and what is not (Deer Hunter, Smokey and the Bandit,Coal Miner's Daughter,The Land Before Time,The Blues Brothers among others) for ever But the set is a good introduction to the studio which in its early days was though of as the stepchild of Hollywood for many years. The only thing I can estimate for certainly that you watch the next version if this set will have Jurassic World and Minions in it.",1442793600,,3084,4.418277680140598
5190861,4,B008YB9346,"The quality of the transfers to DVD are generally good, but could be better.  There is little logic to why a movie was selected for this collection.  When on sale it is a good buy.",1442620800,,180,4.114285714285714
5190862,5,B008YB9346,"A lot of people are whining (after dishing out a good chunk of money) that this collection isn't worth the price.  This is actually true on most days but still, you know EXACTLY what you're getting when you purchase this at whatever price, so it shouldn't even be possible to pay too much.

Regardless, those people should have waited as this item right here is a prime example of why it's a good idea to subscribe to email notifications for the Gold Box Deal of the Day, which featured this boxset for one day only last week.

I picked up the Blu-Ray set for $49.99. And if you prefer regular DVDs, the DVD set was only $24.99. I had no intention of buying this set, but the cost was just WAAAY too good for any serious fan of films to ignore. The price was so good, it was worth it even if you already have a lot of these films.

And this is no bargain bin set, either. There are enough great films in this set to warrant a 5-star rating. As a number of reviewers have noted, there's no real overarching ""theme"" to this set, though I'd say that there IS a theme of it being a catalog of some of Universal's greatest blockbusters, which is a good enough theme for me. If they had mixed in a lot of crappy, obscure, critically-panned flicks (which is almost an inevitability with most ""themed"" sets), then it'd've been an issue; however the lack of any real constraints gave them the freedom to avoid this common pitfall.

My only issue is that some of the films they included are part of a series (Fast and the Furious, The Bourne Identity, Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, and Jaws - though some might also include Despicable Me and even The Sting, the latter of which's sequel is little-known, and for very good reason*), which buying a boxset to complete the series would mean needlessly having a duplicate of the first film. If I could choose, at the very least I would have added the rest of the Back to the Future Trilogy and the Bourne Trilogy (the originals with Matt Damon) if I were to include the first ones as they did. If I could deduct just half a star for this minor issue I would, but it's definitely not worth losing a whole star over, so I'll keep it at 5-stars.

So... moral of the story, just wait for this set to go on sale. It will. There is just no good reason to pay triple figures for it.

*[The Sting II was an absolutely terrible ""sequel"" with none of the same actors that were in the first (including legends like Paul Newman and Robert Redford), and deservedly only bringing in about 1.5% of what the original The Sting earned at the box office ($6Mil to the first's $160Mil - about $360Mil when adjusted to 1983 dollars!) The movie is widely considered one of the worst sequels ever made and it can only be a good thing when the original isn't tainted by its presence.]",1442534400,,2802,4.346080305927342
5190863,1,B008YB9346,"Blu-Ray discs took a very long time to load (over 45 seconds).  None of the discs allow the return of the scene once the stop button is pushed (you are taken to the main selection screen and have to find the scene manually). The Blu-Ray version only has 24 movies (missing Schindler's List).  Had I seen that (and known about the Blu-Ray quality), I would have ordered the DVD version.",1442448000,,385,4.485714285714286

5190865,5,B008YB9346,"This an eclectic collection fer sure... This is for the BLU-RAY box; the DVD box cost more and has a few substitutions.

NOBODY will love all of the 25 movies, and NO ONE will hate all of them either. There are titles, collectively, that
CERTAIN members of your family will love. One hundred dollars [or less] will please Gran'ma & Gran'pa; Mom & Dad; the
kids; and that ""stoner"" friend of the family that hangs out waiting for someone to foolishly pop a beer tab...

This is the second time, today, that I reviewed this collection.
I---immediately---got ten negative votes for being the messenger. Yes! The asking price went waaaaaaaaaay up, quickly!
This time around, I'll not mention what the asking price was right before Amazon Dot Com sold out, but, it certainly
was NOT the $100 that second-party merchants are selling it for now.

Isn't it interesting how investment BUYERS scoop up these deals, then sell them for twice what THEY got 'em for?

Why would they put out the movie and not properly format the movie and sell it as an HD blu ray movie? That's the biggest reason for the 2 stars. Just like another reviewer wrote what happened to the Alpha movies? Instead of putting that POS street fighter cartoon series they could have used that space for those movies.

Some of these films you can buy for $0.75 - $1.00 plus shipping at Amazon and other online retailers. If you make a list of the films you truly want to watch, you can buy such on Blu-ray for probably less than $100. Apparently, this promotion got lost in the shuffle of General Electric selling NBC which owned Universal. I was expecting something spectacular with a nice book. This is pathetic. In comparison you should look at the 20th-Century Fox 75th Anniversary Collection: 75 films on 76 discs. I want to know who was in charge of this project at Universal. They should be ostracized.

But at this point these are movies that could be in the $5 dollar bin at wal mart with how old they are, and that's what they are priced at. $5.08 per movie.

Why not just buy the movies from this collection you want from amazon for the same price, and then actually get to select what movies you want for your money? Because I know half of these movies I would never watch",1381708800,17,601,4.093220338983051

A slim book and an exclusive 15-Track music CD with hit songs from the movies is also provided.

The Extra-Terrestrial, National Lampoon's Animal House, Jaws, The Birds, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Spartacus.

Buy this collection. I would consider it one of the best mega-pack releases from a major studio with plenty of great films that fans will enjoy. Since Amazon is now selling it at 1/3 of the original MSRP there is tremendous value for only $133. However, if you only want a few of the films (or if you already own them) then consider buying them separately on Blu-ray. This set has maintained its value.",1377302400,2,1132,4.746192893401015

This set though features a lot of different films in it so you definitely have to love and appreciate many genres of film to enjoy all the movies in the set.,1369008000,6,553,4.276190476190476
5190890,2,B008YB9346,"How can Universal make a twenty-five film collection celebrating their last one hundred years and exclude Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, two of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed films of all time?
They also left out Psycho.
I do appreciate that they included Dracula, The Birds, Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Apollo 13, along with a few others.
As far as I'm concerned Dracula, Frankenstein, and Bride of Frankenstein are the three films that perfectly represent the classic monster franchise and a large body of work from a specific era.
Yet they included films that absolutely NOBODY cares about such as Pillow Talk! Seriously, who had even herd of that film?",1367884800,5,676,5.099099099099099
5190891,2,B008YB9346,"(many of them in Blu-ray) so why would I want to spend my money for this set?  It doesn't have any appeal.  Who at Universal thought this would be a good idea for any long-time fan of movies in general and Universal movies specifically?

WHAT I WANT is the bonus disc to be made available separately.  The 100 years of (fill in the blank) sounds like wonderful material, but I'm not going to spend triple digit dollars to get it!  Want my money?  Give me a 100 year Universal anniversary disc.  Thank you.",1367452800,3,505,4.365591397849462
5190892,2,B008YB9346,"This collection shows the weakness of Universal.  Universal was the house of horror and low-budget comedies in the 30's and 40's.  Still, they had many fine titles in the 50's.  The previous reviews are correct.  This is simply a bunch of films, instead of something that would interest a collector.  Even doing a 5 of each genre (horror, comedy, rom-com, action, etc) that covered from the beginnings of sound would have made this an interesting collect.  Right now, I can see spending my money elsewhere.",1366070400,57,506,4.894117647058824
5190893,2,B008YB9346,"As individual movies all of these are excellent selections. As a group I already have several of these. I even have have some of them digitally. What I want to know is when is Amazon going to push these collections through the Amazon Video on Demand service. Better yet, when are they going to offer me the opportunity to upgrade my SD Video On Demand library to the HD version, now that my internet service provider has finally caught up with the bandwidth needs. Just have to keep an eye out for those future download caps. :-)",1365984000,3,529,4.463917525773196
5190894,5,B008YB9346,"I've read a few of the reviews left by others, and it just makes me want to slap them with their comments like ""who is this collect for?"" and ""these movies have nothing in common!"".  To that I have to say if you don't enjoy what Universal is trying to give you then don't buy it or comment on it. I, myself am a fan of all types of movies, and there are millions of people out their like me that don't just watch the same kind of movies over and over again but just love movies themselves.  In fact I just got back from Orlando just a few months ago where I got to see their 100 years of Universal celebration, and it was amazing and moving.  So who is this collection for? you ask.  It's for everyone. it's to have and show your children and grand children years from now when most of these movies might be forgotten. because movies like Jaws, Scarface, field of dreams shouldn't be lost and yet I promise you if you go in to any high school right now there are kids out there that have never heard of breakfast club, or Animal house.  (in fact my wife is only 4 years younger than me and she's never seen E.T animal House and never even heard of ""the Birds"".

Now as for the Collection Goes.  This is a great deal even if you don't like some of the movies. at $150, you are getting 25 movies that's $6 a movie. I recently was shopping for E.T on bluray last month and the cheapest I found it was $25.  So basically if you went out and just bought the movies you like singles out of this collection you could have paid for the collection. My only complaint about this collect is ""where is Ghostbusters?""  Ghostbusters, had 3 cartoon spin off shows, was the number one hit song in 84"" had 5 video-games made, and 28 years later people are still screaming for a third movie and yet it didn't make the top 25 list? WTH  (sorry, lost track of my thoughts there)

in closing I will say, if you don't already have these movies. then get this collect. but if you already own most of them which i hope most people would then copy the list down and try to fill in the gaps of your own collection because you are missing out on some great movies.

thank you.

5190895,2,B008YB9346,"This is a wonderful (if not great) collection of movies. But you see, the thing is, if you're into good movies, chances are you already have a bunch of these. For example, out of the 25 titles listed, I already have 13. For someone like me, paying that kind of money for duplicates of so many titles makes no sense at all. If you're new on the block and want to start a library (and have the money), sure, it's an amazing collection. As other reviewers have pointed out, though, one man's ""wow!"" is another man's yawn. You could never please everyone . . .which makes it seem futile to assemble a collection like this. And another thing: If this set celebrates 100 years of films from Universal, how come the oldest is 1930? Didn't they make anything worthwhile before ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1930)? There are two versions of DRACULA (the Lugosi one and the Spanish-language version made concurrently) . . .but no FRANKENSTEIN? And what about all those Lon Chaney films? THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME? Okay, this is where it comes down to a matter of taste or choices. But to leave out the entire silent era?

They would be backed up in the cloud forever.",1359158400,13,323,4.161290322580645
5190900,5,B008YB9346,"My BR collection is well north of 140 movies.  And yet, I own NONE of the movies in this collection.  Not one.  Go figure.  As I flip through the collection, I'm amazed at the selection.  Could there have been other titles?  Ummm, do I really need to answer that?  But the titles run an amazing gamut of genres.  And, some of the titles have never been released as stand-alone.  So in this collection I get JP instead of having to buy the trilogy.  Same with BTTF.  If, of 25 titles, only two are true stinkers then it's still a great deal.

If any one reviewer put together 25 titles, there'd be disagreement among 100% of reviewers as to which should or should not have been included.  I, for one, love the collection.

Blu-rays range from good to great in terms of PQ and AQ.  Booklet is OK.  No great shakes.  Supplementals alone are worthy of the investment.

As a former Catholic, I know guilt.  And I have ZERO over this purchase.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it you haters on here.

5190901,5,B008YB9346,"Universal deserves a special award at the Oscars, and, for that matter, every other awards show ever, up to and including the Nobel Peace Prize, for uncovering and releasing this treasure trove of long lost films! I know that it may seem crazy to spend almost 250 dollars on one collection of movies, but you people have no idea what kind of a bargain you'll be getting!

As a distinguished film fetishist, I am one of the few people who knows anything about these rare masterpieces! The inclusion of ""Mamma Mia!"" alone is worth the hefty price! This film was considered so controversial and shocking that the original audience went blind and deaf after watching it, and it has never been seen by anyone since!

""Do the Right Thing"" is a nearly-forgotten instructional video on how to do everything correctly - a must for first-time job applicants! I cannot wait to see that one! I have read so much about it, but I'm sure the words don't do it justice.

I will even watch the films that were never released because of how terrible they were considered to be. Why watch a terrible film? Because of the historical importance! We must learn how to not make films from past failures! Which is why supposedly awful films such as ""ET"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" will be so informative!

Not to mention, the geniuses at Universal have included a BOOK talking about the films! Let's see - 72 pages. 25 movies. Gasp! That is exactly 2.88 pages per film! Why read countless pages of false information about the films online when you can have this book which will no doubt contain insight into each film included THE LIKES OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN READ!

Do whatever you can to get your hands on this one-of-a-kind piece of history! After all, it will sell out quickly! Then you will never be able to see any of these films ever again!
