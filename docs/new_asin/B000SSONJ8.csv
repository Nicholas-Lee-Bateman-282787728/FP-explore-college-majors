2889868,4,B000SSONJ8,"Funny, but as with many releases from the same company (Alpha Home Entertainment), it looks like there was very little if any effort put into restoring the video quality of the shows. I really liked this show, but I can't give this 5 stars on account of how bad the quality is. I know the show is old, but even considering that fact the quality in underwhelming.",1460505600,,362,4.417910447761194

2889873,3,B000SSONJ8,"I remember seeing this show when I was a kid; it was probably the very first show I ever saw on television so seeing a bit of it again after all these years was great fun.  The series itself is hardly great television but still holds up surprising well thanks in great part to Hattie McDaniel and later Lousie Beavers--both wonderful in the title role.  I wish there were more episodes available of this show, especially with the great Ethel Waters who originated the role of Beulah on television  I also wish the picture quality was better--the two episodes with McDaniel seem better than the two with Beavers.  Still, it was a fun look back at a memorable TV show of the past.",1440374400,,678,4.487804878048781

2889876,5,B000SSONJ8,Amazing episodes. I absolutely love the classical styling of the show. It's not offensive or degrading which was a concern. Just wished there were more episodes or at least other shows similar to this. Hattie's acting never disappoints!,1426118400,,236,5.2368421052631575

2889880,5,B000SSONJ8,"This is classic early TV.  87 episodes were produced but only seven are known to survive. It is a shame that more episodes cannot be located for the historical value if nothing else.  Wonderful series which featured Ethel Waters, Hattie McDaniel and Louise Beavers at various times in the lead role.",1409616000,2,299,4.8431372549019605

2889883,3,B000SSONJ8,"This show is quite dated now, but was one I looked forward to watching because it starred Hattie McDaniel.  Unfortunately, this DVD only has a few episodes on it and Hattie McDaniel isn't in but one or two.  It is not something I would watch again, but it was interesting, nonetheless, to see this great actress in something other than Gone With the Wind.

The item did arrive on time, and as promised, so I am happy with the purchase and with the seller.",1406332800,,455,4.392857142857143
2889884,3,B000SSONJ8,The Picture and sound quality of some of the episodes are really bad!!!!  The shows we're not preserved properly and should've been remastered before putting on DVD.,1385942400,,165,5.111111111111111
2889885,5,B000SSONJ8,"Neither of us had ever seen this show before, but found nonetheless, that we were instantly drawn in and interested in the character's lives.  I guess that, is what GOOD writing and acting can do for a show. The only negative is that NOW we would like to see more episodes of this charming show and we cannot find any other DVD's available for purchase.",1377734400,,353,4.430769230769231
2889886,5,B000SSONJ8,"I enjoyed the Beulah Show on radio when I was a kid in the 1940's.  I don't recall ever seeing the show on early television, though.  The television version was very well done, I think, even for those times.  I especially enjoyed the character played by Butterfly McQueen, who, along with Hattie McDaniel, played in ""Gone With the Wind.""  I would love to have more episodes of the television show.  I notice this one is labeled Volume 1, so there surely are more episodes.  I think anyone would enjoy this show from the very early days of television. The quality is also very good, considering the source.",1364083200,3,605,4.607476635514018

2889888,5,B000SSONJ8,This is the first sitcom I remember watching every week as a kid.  It made the kids and adults laugh.  There seemed to be a 'lesson' in each episode.  I am hoping my grandchildren will get as much out of it as I did.,1342396800,,216,3.8636363636363638
2889889,4,B000SSONJ8,"Video quality could have been better, because it looks as if these shows were not made from the masters, or, perhaps, we have the best quality available.
A wonderful era in which people did not judge everything from a politically correct point of view.
Although hokey, it is the 'hokeyness' of the show that I wanted to remember.
Next, Walt Disney Company needs to release 'Song of the South'...another wonderful period piece which remains hidden due to political correctness.",1337904000,6,476,5.037974683544304
2889890,5,B000SSONJ8,This was a delight to receive and watch. I remember watching the show as a young girl (maybe over 50 years ago). Thank you,1304899200,,122,4.125
2889891,5,B000SSONJ8,"Excellent entertainment from the early 1950s when things were better ... Something I would like to address ... I constantly see reviews about classic vintage TV shows were folks are complaining about the poor quality of the video ... Wake Up! They did not record TV shows in 1952 in 1080p High-Def ... The quality of the recording of this DVD considering the show is now 58+ years old is EXCELLENT! Audio was just fine ... All in All very enjoyable and well worth the $$$, Thank you Alpha Video!",1293753600,11,495,4.511111111111111

2889894,5,B000SSONJ8,I like watching The Beula Show on DVD. Never heard about this DVD before. But thought it was good.,1255824000,5,98,4.2105263157894735
2889895,4,B000SSONJ8,"Black female in the lead role of a television sitcom and I am not talking about the year 2000 but rather 1950. Ethel Waters was the first Beulah, followed by Hattie McDaniel and then Louise Beavers. All were excellent.

The characters are great, the scripts wonderful and the stereotypes classic. If you love television sitcoms then you have to watch these rare episodes. The condition of the four episodes ranges from 8 out of 10 to 6.5 out of 10 with Beulah Goes Gardening, the first episode the best quality. The last two I rate at 6.5 and have slight distortion and vibration. They look like they were recorded off TV to VHS and then transferred to DVD.

It would be great if more episodes were released with a host explaining  background and history of the three female lead actresses. I gave this a four-star rating due to picture quality. I know a film collector who has near mint 16mm prints of these episodes and I wish a company would release them on DVD. This version is not worth $[...] plus shipping but is worth $3 plus shipping.

Unfortunately, the ""Pioneers of Television"" series on PBS did not include early seminal programs such as Beulah or Amos and Andy. Therefore, buy this DVD and watch a great sitcom.",1215129600,28,1224,4.60091743119266
2889896,4,B000SSONJ8,"THE BEULAH SHOW (also known simply as BEULAH) is a light sitcom from television's first years best known for being the first program to star an African American actress.  The syndicated series ran three seasons, 1950-1953.  Based on the late 40's radio sitcom starring Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel of GONE WITH THE WIND fame, the television series' first two years starred Ethel Waters as Beulah, a big-hearted housekeeper for a young white family (presumably the producers chose Waters because she was a bigger star at the time than McDaniel).  Miss Waters was reportedly unhappy with the mediocre scripts and left the show after the second season which led to an overhaul of the program and a completely new cast.

The wonderful Hattie was finally cast as the video Beulah but tragically she was only able to complete eight episodes, dying later that year of breast cancer.  The role of Beulah was then taken over by Hattie's longtime contemporary in movies, Louise Beavers (the rest of the new cast remained).  Reportedly there were a couple of final episodes that season (the series' last) in which Lillian Randolph played the role (possibly due to Beaver's signing to play a featured role on the network sitcom MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY).

The series, apparently now in public domain, has long been unseen except for a vhs tape or two issued by minor companies.  At long last, a budget DVD version has been released of four episodes, two starring Hattie McDaniel and two with Louise Beavers.

BEULAH GOES GARDENING has Hattie has the put-upon maid who ends up having to do the gardening when Mr. Henderson, in a penny-pinching move, decides to no longer employ a gardener and have the family do it instead, only thing is the ""family"" always has something else to do and it only means more work for Beulah.  In THE WALTZ, little Donny Henderson is floundering in dance class, so Hattie and her longtime beau Bill decide to give him lessons, only the boogie woogie they teach him isn't quite the style he is supposed to learn. THE NEW ARRIVAL has a baby carriage arriving at the Henderson home leading Louise Beavers to believe the Mrs. is expecting and the bogus secret spreads like wildfire.  SECOND WEDDING has Louise convinced her employers' marriage is on the rocks after reading a magazine article  on the warning signs for marriages in trouble.

Both actresses do quite well with the slender, unpolished material.  I have always preferred Hattie McDaniel, one of the very  best character actresses ever in film, over the quite talented Louise Beavers who is a gentler, less comic actress.  It's touching and sad to see Hattie in her final role, not quite the spitfire of her classic movie performances but still a lovable endearing personality.  Louise is equally good as Beulah and her two episodes actually are a little better written.

Print quality for these programs is no better than good minus to acceptable (the Beavers episodes appear to be copies of videos rather than film prints and are only fair) but this material is very rare and you are not likely to see better prints anytime soon (indeed only about seven episodes of the show are still known to be around but surely there are more somewhere  since the program was rerun for several years and the 1950's aren't that long ago).

1940's ""B"" leads David Bruce and Jane Frazee play Beulah's employers, the Hendersons, child actor Stuffy Singer is their son Donny.  Beulah's elusive beau is played by Ernest Whitman (who had a bit part in GONE WITH THE WIND as the black carpetbagger), her dizzy best friend Oriole is played by Ruby Dandridge (Dorothy's mom).

THE BEULAH SHOW is a trailblazer in that it's black and white supporting performers are on an equal status and share approximately the same amount of screen time. And it's wonderful to see both Hattie McDaniel and Louise Beavers front and center in a program given the starring billing they richly deserved.",1192838400,75,3934,4.840298507462687

I am a big fan of hers and thought she almost ""stole"" ""Gone With the Wind"" from it's great stars.  She was that good.  And I guess the Academy agreed with me for indeed she did win an ""Oscar"" for her performance in that movie.  The first black actress to ever win the statue. This isn't a great sitcom, and indeed was pulled after a short time because of racial stereotyping and all that upheaval in the 50's but it still is worth viewing just to see this extraordinary woman share her warmth, charm and  the magic that was uniquely hers.",1473552000,2,642,4.308333333333334
