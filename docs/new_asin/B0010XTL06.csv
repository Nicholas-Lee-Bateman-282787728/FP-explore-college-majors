Tables Match
Motor City Machine Guns & Jay Lethal Vs. Team 3D & Johnny Devine
This was a pretty good way to start off the pay per view, they had a couple good spots with the table, nothing really special or innovative here but it was still a good opening match for a ppv. Kind of a silly ending, but it did make me laugh though. Rating 3/5

Roxxi Laveaux & ODB Vs. Velvet Sky & Angelina Love
This match was a little too short for me but it does help put ODB over as one crazy lady. Angelina Love pulls off some pretty good moves I just wish they would've given this match at least 5 more minutes. Rating 3/5

""Cowboy"" James Storm Vs. ""E.Y."" Eric Young
This match was a little to slow paced for me, it was rather boring at times. Although there were a couple of good spots, the ending was good and it ensures that this rivalry isn't over yet. Rating 3/5

Feast Or Fired
There are four brief cases hanging on poles above four corners of the ring, one has a title shot for the x division belt, one has a title shot for the world belt, one has a title shot for the tag belts and the other contains a pink slip saying you're fired from TNA wrestling. Honestly this gimmick match just doesnt work, are we as fans supposed to believe that these wrestlers will risk unemployment for a shot at any of these titles maybe for the world title but any of them come on TNA the only person who should've been fired for this one is Vince Russo. This was just a big brawl if they wanted to get all these guys face time on a ppv they would've been better off just having a bar room brawl. I'm highly disappointed with this one. Rating 1/5

TNA Women's Championship
Gail Kim (C) Vs. Awesome Kong
The match was steady going back and forth between kong and kim and it was just getting good then the ending totally messed everything up. But the after match antics helped further the storyline. It's pretty much typical Russo stuff. Rating 3/5

10,000 Tacks Match
Abyss & Raven Vs. Black Reign & Rellik
This match was just ok for me it had its entertaining points but it had its boring points as well. It's really nothing special I've seen better and I expect better from all 4 wrestlers.
Rating 3/5

Booker T & Kaz Vs. Christian Cage
I would sadly have to say this was the match of the night, Kaz definitely deserves a good push as a singles wrestler. The ending continues the interesting storyline of Christian possibly becoming a face once again. Rating 4/5

Six Man War
The Angle Alliance Vs. Samoa Joe & Kevin Nash & ""E.Y."" Eric Young
This match was way too short but it was exciting given the amount of time alloted. Before the match Samoa Joe cut a hardcore straight from the heart type of promo kind of similar to the type of promos mick foley cut during his time in ecw. Joe let all his frustrations out in the promo and for this reason and this reason alone I recommend buying the dvd that was definitely the best promo I've heard anybody cut in either WWE or TNA for all of 2007. Rating 4/5 my rating is high cause of the joe promo trust me it was that good.

In closing I would like to say this pay per view was ok but most of this stuff was just to further the storylines and TNA uses their pay per views too often to just further storylines. They need to be doing most of that on Impact and they need to use the pay per views to make fans wanna buy the next pay per view. You're never gonna become #1 if you put Impact level stuff on pay per view fire Vince Russo and hire Paul Heyman. This dvd is worth buying for the Joe promo alone he saved the show all hail Samoa Joe the savior of TNA.",1202428800,,3653,4.176136363636363
8239298,2,B0010XTL06,"Tables Match: Jay Lethal & Motor City Machine Guns vs. Team 3D & Johnny Devine - Maybe it's because all of the previous Team 3D/Tables matches I've seen in TNA were better in comparison but this match was just really decent to me.  There were a couple of missed camera shots of some spots like the Guns stereo dives onto Team 3D outside the ring & it seemed like the crowd wasn't popping for all the spots that they used to.  The finish was completely lame (just like the first time it was done at F. Resolution 2006) as Lethal drove Devine though the last table only for the referee (who was down) to miss it so Team 3D attacks & moves Devine on top.

Angelina Love & Velvet Sky vs. O.D.B. & Roxxi - Boy, O.D.B. was just over with the crowd from the start.  Despite some of the ""WWE divas"" elements like the spanking between the knockouts & trying to get the referee involved, this was another match that was just decent & nothing really memorable about it.

Eric Young vs. James Storm - Unlike the previous PPV & the following PPV, this is an actual match & not a bunch of backstage segments involving them drinking beer.  A solid encounter here as Young's arm was worked on & sold thoughtout the encounter while Eric actually stayed away from his ""goofy"" image & seemed like he was looking for revenge.

Feast Or Fired Match - The rules were that there were a different case set up on a pole in 4 corners and the match ends when all four cases are taken down.  If you can get past Kip James outfit that looks like he stole from Mickie James, this was one of those ""all of the place"" multiman brawls that TNA loves to do whenever they have battle royal/gauntlet matches.  It was another match that was decent for what it was.  But I will give some extra credit for Chris Harris who was the only one I noticed actually selling the fact that one of those cases would get him fired.
As a side note, there were a couple of swerves & storyline twist the following weeks revolving around the cases but here are the results.  B.G. has the tag title shot, Scott Steiner has the X Division Title shot, Petey Williams won the World Title shot, and Christopher Daniels (who beat Senshi to win his case) had the pink slip & was ""fired""

Womens Champion Gail Kim vs. Awesome Kong - The story here was David vs. Goliath...except both of them are women as this was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches.  Kong for the most part dominated Gail Kim who was able to get in a few shots here & there with working on Kong's arm in the beginning & then taking to the air later in the match starting to gain some momentum before Kong recovered & just beat Kim down & refused to stop causing the DQ.  The aftermath with Kong beating up the babyface knockouts, the referee, and powerbombing Gail on the chair heavily sold the fact that Kong is a monster.  The result was to set up a rematch which I'm sure a majority of people wouldn't mind.

Match Of 1,000 Tacks: Abyss & Raven vs. Black Reign & Rellik - With Rhino injured, Raven returns once again in his enviroment.  In a nutshell here, it's the same thing you see in every Abyss hardcore match like you've seen for the past year.  There was blood, there was brawling, and just based off the name alone...you saw men getting slammed on thumbtacks.  However, one spot that got my attention was when Rellik put tacks into Raven's mouth & proceeded to throw forearms into his mouth...that was sick.

Booker T & Kaz vs. Christian Cage & Robert Roode - My favorite match of the night as it was a real competitve back & forth match as all four men gave a great effort here even down to the little things like Roode & Cage doing the ""heel"" fake tags in & out and Kaz fighting to get to Booker T for the tag at one point in the match.
As a side note, if they were trying to get over the fact that the woman stalking Robert Roode was just a ""fan"" then they didn't need to put a spotlight on her throughout the match.

Samoa Joe, Kevin Nash, Eric Young vs. Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, Tomko - The whole story here was that this was suppost to be the Outsiders reunion (which TNA did close to 3 years earlier at the first Turning Point for those trivia fans) but Scott Hall no showed the event causing Samoa Joe to perform a ""shoot"" promo on Hall's no show & throwing some ""subliminal lines"" at Nash before introducing Eric Young as the third man in the match.  From there, the story of the match was the tension between Nash & Joe as each man would tag into the match through Eric Young and at the end, Joe wasn't in a hurry to save Nash from Angle's anklelock & even after the victory, Nash just walked away & didn't even stay to get his hand raised or celebrate the victory.  This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as the match was average in itself & the Angle Alliance & Young were just backdrop players for the issue between Nash & Joe.

In the end, you would have been disappointed with the ""card subject to change"" but since you already know what to expect here, this was a real below average TNA PPV where the most of the matches were passable & decent to just average at best.  This was one of TNA's worst showings since No Surrender 2006 as there were really only 2 matches & a promo worth checking out here.  If you are a TNA diehard & have around a few extra bucks you won't miss then go ahead but besides that, you aren't missing anything.",1202169600,12,5390,4.264965652600589
8239299,1,B0010XTL06,"TNA really dissapoints here.  If you want good TNA get Boundy For Glory or Slammiversary from this year, or any Bound For Glory for that matter.  Crappy storylines full of cheese and nonsense have taken over.  I was definately excited to see the outsiders work together one more time but that doesnt even happen.  This cover is False advertising!!!!! it turns out to be Eric Young!? not Scott Hall.  Sorry, I like Eric Young, but it was a weak main event.  Overall advice, don't buy anymore TNA until you hear that Vince Russo doesn't work there anymore.  Hope this helps....",1201392000,,575,4.69
