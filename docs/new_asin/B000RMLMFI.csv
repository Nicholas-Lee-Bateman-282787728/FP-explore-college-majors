2869579,5,B000RMLMFI,"Oh the memories! I have not had this wonderful of a time in many a year. I was transported back to a time of days gone by, and as I watched this show I actually teared up in melancholy remembrance of childhood. Half way through the season, I remembered something that I had not thought of in years, my Coon Skin Cap! I put the DVD on pause, and headed up into the attic. After hours of searching, I finally found it. I then ran, almost like I was a child again, back to the TV room, but this time with my trusty Coon Skin Cap on my head. As I watched the rest of season 5, I thought of all my exciting childhood adventures. I have a bad back now, and am not employed, but that did not stop me from jumping up at one point to let Daniel Boone know someone was sneaking up on him! My mom thought I had gone crazy. This is a must have for any fan of a by gone era.",1187654400,17,861,3.842696629213483
2869580,3,B000RMLMFI,"Daniel Boone was a man, yes, a big man! If TV westerns are your thing, this was 1 of the better shows.",1428537600,,102,3.6818181818181817
2869581,5,B000RMLMFI,"I was born in the 60's and we would sit around everyday and weekends watching Daniel Boone.  Those were the fun days and no stress.  Now when I get stressed I watch Daniel Boone and my family leaves it also when we have Daniel Boone weekends and camp out in our living room and watch Daniel Boone all night.  Great collection and I would recommend this for friends, family and loved ones.",1416355200,,388,4.361111111111111
2869582,5,B000RMLMFI,"I loved this series. Even though it didn't have Mingo in it, the other new characters made up for him not being in it. This is my families favorite season.",1413936000,,155,4.2

2869586,5,B000RMLMFI,Years ago our family enjoyed the TV series and now with fond memories we can enjoy it again. It's like traveling back in time to that happy place of childhood to be able to enjoy the series once more.  For us and our grandchildren it's been a great value.,1365638400,,255,4.204081632653061
2869587,5,B000RMLMFI,"Daniel Boone: The Television Series Season 5

Go glad I purchased this video for my Western video collection. Always looking for more.",1358121600,,134,5.090909090909091
2869588,5,B000RMLMFI,"All the Daniel Boone Season's are great. I own them all. Season 5 is no exception. The Daniel Boone Series was on the leading edge of TV in speaking out against social bigotry, injustice and other parts of human nature that exploit society and nature. The series always has a lessons learned conclusion that can help us today learn to get along with our fellow man and nature in a better ways. This is a great series for your children or grandchildren. Role models are important today and character matters. I have to admit that my favorite episodes of Daniel Boone are the episodes done with Mingo (Ed Ames). They were and are the best episodes.",1324857600,,646,4.577586206896552
2869589,4,B000RMLMFI,"I would give season 5 a higher rating, but it is just not the same without Mingo. The addition of Jimmy Dean to most episodes did not make up for the lack of Mingo. Ironically, Mingo is featured on the DVD main menu!  You will notice they changed the opening theme song again (like every season), but this version is strange and disturbing - just my observation :)",1322265600,,364,4.352941176470588
2869590,5,B000RMLMFI,"As I sit here writing this review,I wonder what I could possibly say about Daniel Boone season 5. Anybody who has bought this dvd would have already purchased the previous four and would have seen this series before on tv. All I can do is to add to the people who have already reviewed this dvd. It's one of the best tv series that I have ever seen. I don't know what I was doing back in the 60's but I have never seen this show before. I bought the first four dvd's plus this one, sight unseen, and on the fact that I had seen Fess Parker as Davy Crockett. I was so happy I did as I have really enjoyed this series. I wish I could have got the final season but it looks like that it is no longer available. This is certainly a family show when families were real families. I don't know what constitutes a family today. But back to the dvd. Liberation Entertainment has done a top-notch job on producing these dvd's and for that many thanks. The picture and sound quality are great with stunning color pictures. Also in interviewing the actors that were on the show. It gives a fascinating insight to the show and I am tickled pink to have finally seen this show.
Thanks, once again, Liberation Entertainment.",1317772800,,1209,4.307017543859649
2869591,5,B000RMLMFI,"I grew up watching the Daniel Boone TV series. I ended quite a great kid, young adult and adult. This series will bring into the home a bit of historical fiction, wonderful lessons on right and wrong, overall great wholesome family entertainment which is lacking in many present day television programs. Most of the DVD's in this series have been reformatted and look crisp, great for all the outdoor scenes. I highly recommend this for families with children ages 5 - 12 as well as us adults who wish to relive the silver age of a televisions of the 1960's. Turn on the T.V. drop in a DVD and travel back in time in two senses both in history with a great American hero and pioneer and the history of a 1960's TV series. ENJOY !",1268352000,,729,4.367647058823529
2869592,5,B000RMLMFI,"Loved this show in its original run and love it now some 45 years later.  Fess Parker was great in frontier roles with his tall stature.
Anyone who likes good family storytelling with lessons of human dignity and morality should have this series.",1253232000,,246,4.72093023255814
2869593,5,B000RMLMFI,"A todos los que veiamos esta serie de TV en su epoca, les recomiendo comprarla, estan todos los capitulos a partir de la primera temporada, yo ya compre los primeros cinco capitulos, se ven perfectos, y lo que es muy importante para mi, es que vienen con el audio original en espaol, como lo transmitian aqui en latinoamerica. La recomiendo ampliamente!!!!!!",1252886400,,358,4.885245901639344
2869594,5,B000RMLMFI,"Very nice TV show, the quality of the DVD's is great; I bought seasons 1, 2 and 3 in Spain and the copy was quite bad. This release amazed me because I can choose the Spanish audio, that's the 1960's original southamerican synchronising, the one I watched on TV when I was a kid.",1218758400,,279,4.185185185185185

2869596,4,B000RMLMFI,We love watching Daniel Boone.  This season is good but not as good as the first four seasons.  We were disappointed to see that Mingo isn't in the show anymore.  Now Josh (Jimmy Dean) is now Daniel's sidekick.,1208649600,3,210,4.473684210526316
2869597,3,B000RMLMFI,"The 165 one-hour episodes (45 in B&W, 120 in color) of the frontier western ""Daniel Boone"" originally aired on NBC from 1964-1970. So this DVD set is the fifth of six seasons of this extremely popular baby boomer show.  The episode titles and their original air dates from Season Five are listed below.

The show itself may seem a little odd today due to an uncharacteristic emphasis on racial/ethnic diversity (insert Ed Ames as Mingo and NFL lineman Rosey Grier as Gabe Cooper). But the times were a-changing as the country tried to turn itself into LBJ's ""Great Society"" and network executives smelled an opportunity to cash in on the baby boomer's budding social awareness.

The series moved between a domestic focus on Boone's family (Patricia Blair as wife Rebecca, Veronica Cartwright as daughter Jemima, and Darby Hinton as his son Israel) to ""one-with-the-wilderness""/""the British are evil"" themes. The series focused on Boone after he had moved to Kentucky.

Daniel was played by Fess Parker who already had an established coonskin cap franchise from his mid-1950's Disney TV portrayal of Davy Crockett. Boone is played as an even tempered peaceful man who likes to chum around in the woods with Oxford educated Indians and runaway black slaves (see above), your basic 1770's flower child. Other than his confrontations with ""the man"" (represented by those nasty Redcoats) there is very little messy violence and lots of ""Little House on the Prairie"" moments.

Cartwright, the most talented of the ensemble, is frustratingly underutilized. Particularly given that the most celebrated event in the real Daniel Boone's life was the rescue of his daughter and her two friends from Indian kidnappers.

Cartwright and Ames are not in the episodes on this DVD set as she bailed out after season two and he after  season four.  Budding sausage king Jimmy Dean was added as Josh Clements, a character in the tradition of Chester and Festus from ""Gunsmoke"".

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
