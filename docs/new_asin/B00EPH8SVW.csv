8608110,4,B00EPH8SVW,"This set contains 20 westerns, mostly Italian made westerns, including a few rare ones that aren't offered on many other budget packs.  I was very interested in seeing ""The Bounty Killer"" since it is Tomas Milian's first western and a Quentin Tarantino favorite--and I was let down by audio that becomes out of sync after about 30 minutes into the movie.  It was still watchable but far from ideal, yet the other movies I quickly tested on the same disc had no audio problems.

Most of the movies are presented in a letterboxed widescreen format, which means that the whole picture is preserved but it is reduced to a full screen size.  Not ideal, but at least the edges aren't cut!  Here is a breakdown of the picture formats.

Disc 1
Sundance Cassidy and Butch the Kid / Full screen
Life Is Tough, Eh Providence? / Widescreen
The Bounty Killer / Letterboxed Widescreen
The Price of Power / Letterboxed Widescreen
Disc 2
Massacre Time / Letterboxed Widescreen
Some Dollars for Django / Letterboxed Widescreen
Little Rita of the West / Letterboxed Widescreen
Light the Fuse Sartana Is coming / Letterboxed Widescreen
Disc 3
Holy Water Joe / Letterboxed Widescreen
Dig Your Grave Sabata Is coming / Full screen
Buffalo Bill Hero of the West / Letterboxed Widescreen?  (hard to tell)
Sartana Killed Them All / Letterboxed Widescreen
Disc 4 (the American westerns)
Gone to Texas / Full screen
The Bounty Man / Full screen
The Trackers / Full screen
I Will Fight No More Forever / Full screen
Disc 5
Buddy Goes West / Letterboxed Widescreen
Wanted / Letterboxed Widescreen
Sartana in the Valley of Death / Letterboxed Widescreen
Blood Money / Letterboxed Widescreen

In short, the only true widescreen release is ""Life is Tough, Eh Providence?"" though I believe the four American westerns were originally shot in full screen.  The picture and audio quality seems to range but they generally look fine for a budget pack.  Running time seems to match with packaging for all releases.",1436313600,,1977,4.839762611275964
