1686857,3,B0000633TM,"In 1999-2002 Scottish Television Enterprises released 26 anime-influenced episodes that mostly adapted the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes by Conan Doyle. Although intended for children, the animations are enjoyable to adult fans of Sherlock Holmes to see where characters, plot threads, and dialog has been lifted from the original stories. The animations are well done, and the episodes have some surprisingly sophisticated vocabulary, as ""conundrum"" and ""sibling rivalry.""
Seven of the 26 episodes have been released on two DVDs issued by different companies:
(1) The fall & rise of Sherlock Holmes (released 4/02 by Trimark) contains (TT 1.18):
The fall and rise of Sherlock Holmes [adaptation: The final problem]
The crime machine [adaptation: The valley of fear]
The hounds of the Baskervilles: [adaptation: The Hound of the Baskervilles]
The sign of four
also: a multiple-choice game
(2) Out of this world (released 9/03) by UAV contains (TT 1.28):
The sign of four
The adventures of the dancing men
Silver Blaze
The Gloria Scott
Note that ""The sign of four"" is duplicated. ""Fall,"" ""Crime,"" and ""Hounds"" are the first three episodes;
the other episodes are out-of-sequence.
The episodes are enjoyable if watched in small doses, for example, for snippets of dialogue from the canon, plus robotics and modernistic stuff like ""DNA scans."" The first episode (""Fall"") will be of greatest interest in transporting Holmes from the 20th to 22nd century.",1085702400,18,1455,5.358078602620087
1686858,2,B0000633TM,"This short-lived cartoon series from 1999 started with an interesting premise; Sherlock Holmes was cryogenicly frozen, and thawed out in the 22nd Century. His faithful companion Watson is long dead (replaced with a robot), and he is now faced with a female version of Inspector Lestrade. The question quickly becomes, can Holmes' intellect and specialized skills help him to solve futuristic crimes with the same success he had in Victorian England?
Sadly for Holmes fans, the ideas stop there. Little or nothing makes much sense as far as the master detective's history or methods are concerned, and beyond the basic premise I just outlined, the balance of the program is limited to standard cartoon mystery fare not even on a par with Scooby Doo... AFTER Scrappy Doo joined the cast.
There are many happy, forced jokes, and little or no true Holmesian deduction. Serious Sherlock Holmes fans will certainly wish to avoid the series, since it is aimed squarely at youngsters. Parents, on the other hand, have nothing to fear from the show if they wish to sit their kids down in front of it. Only a serious student of the master detective will find the program objectionable.",1027382400,4,1175,4.9393939393939394
1686859,4,B0000633TM,"It was better than i expected.  If you like history and science fiction mixed than this is for you.  I liked the mixture of computer animation along with the regular animation.  Also its not rocket science mysteries, just simple fun",1025740800,7,232,4.75
1686889,3,B0000633TM,My only problem with this was the fact that it skipped part of the story that was origionally shown before the intro credits. Made it hard to understand when later references were made to the missing parts!,1371427200,,206,4.594594594594595
1686890,3,B0000633TM,"Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century certainly sounds interesting, but it is not the most amazing show out there. I was surprised to see a few creative ideas (like the fact the Waston is a robot and Lesterade is a woman), and the animation is fair. The colors of the show clash a lot though and the script contains a lot of ""It's elementary!"" and ""Eyes and brain"" sort of dialogue. At times the story can even be a little difficult to follow, but that's what you have to expect with anything that has to do with Sherlock Holmes XD.
  I would watch the first episode even if you are the slightest bit interested, because I see it as a either ""I really like it"" or "" I really don't like it"" kind of show. I think I'll have to watch a few more episodes before I can really decide what I think.",1367107200,,789,4.150326797385621
1686891,5,B0000633TM,the mestory TV show ever i don't know how others can't be entreged when they watch this program started way after the books stoped,1357171200,,130,4.458333333333333
1686892,1,B0000633TM,DONT BUY OR RENT THIS ONE ... UNLESS YOUR 9 YEARS OLD OR UNDER ... BUYERS BEWARE !!! THANK GOD i ONLY RENTED IT !!!,1334448000,,115,3.64
1686893,5,B0000633TM,"The animation is very well done, as is the plot. It uses reasoning and values to portray a positive role model in Holmes. The series omits all the drug and alcohol abuse seen in the more modern adaptations.",1318464000,4,206,4.447368421052632
1686894,4,B0000633TM,"I used to watch this show as a kid on Fox Kids.  It was an awesome show then, and still is.  The concept is so absurd; perfect for a cartoon show.  The animation is a bit subpar, but altogether, a great show.",1313798400,4,208,3.9047619047619047
1686895,5,B0000633TM,"This is a very interesting concept for an animated show, Sherlock Holmes was in suspended animation and is revived in the future. A robot becomes his new ""Watson"". The stories are well written, the characters full developed, the animation is fluid and well done. The series is from the 1990's and was shown on television. Despite what the cover of the DVD says, this is NOT a full length feature. To me a full length feature is one show that is over an hour in length. What it does have is 4 episodes from the series, in order as far as I can tell. The next disc after this is called ""Out of This World"", it also has 4 episodes. This DVD is enjoyable for teens and adults too, in my opinion, important if you have ever sat through some mind numbing animated shows.",1262908800,3,764,4.3125
1686896,3,B0000633TM,"If you get this, and I do recommend it, be prepared for something missing.  A number of scenes are missing from this DVD.  They even show you flashbacks to scenes that were NOT even shown.  They even cut out the entire opening scene of the last episode 'The Sign of Four' tells you what is going on.  I love Sherlock Holmes and I was thrilled to now have Sherlock Homes in the 22nd Century in my collection, but I feel cheated that DIC believed that they didn't need to include the entire show.  So be warned, if you don't understand what is going on, or how someone knew something, blame DIC.",1152835200,9,593,4.306306306306307
1686897,5,B0000633TM,I'm an old Holmes fan and I'm proud to say this is a very enjoyable program. Unfortunately there are only a few episodes available for purchase. I wish the entire series were on DVD.,1148601600,6,182,4.382352941176471
1686898,5,B0000633TM,"I have always been a HUGE fan of Sherlock Holmes! I have read all of the stories and have collectable antique books in very large quantities. I am also, although I AM ""a bit too old"" as my parents once put it, a cartoon and anime lover. What better to come along but this? When I first saw it, lounging about in my living room bored out of my mind, I was instantly hooked! I have both the DVD's and I'm impatiently waiting for a third! My only regret is that they ended the show, and my only fear is that they won't come out with more DVD's. It is truly a joy to watch for all ages. Instead of the risque humor and sensuality of most shows on the television today it tries to teach children how to use their minds and observe their surroundings. You shall never be afraid to let your children watch the show. You may even be surprised of what your children may learn from it! ^_^",1120694400,12,879,4.116279069767442

7958288,5,B0000633TM,"My kids would watch it, or at least listen to the music if we were rushed, every morning before school. One of the better offerings in the cartoon genre, doing an excellent job of transporting Arthur Conan Doyle's characters into the 22nd century, no mean feat!",1416441600,,261,4.695652173913044

7958291,5,B0000633TM,"Our daughter loves these and has repeatedly watched every episode on Prime streaming.
Fills that niche for pre-teens/early-teens with animated content that's not too childish and yet not too intense.
Has actually enticed her to get into the classic Sherlock Holmes character and original stories (which some of these episodes specifically credit for their inspiration).",1386028800,,369,5.7272727272727275
