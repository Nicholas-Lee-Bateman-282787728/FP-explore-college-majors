8461493,1,B0058EAPRG,"""Tortured Angels"" and ""Strike of the Tortured Angels"" is the same film. I watched mine from a multi-pack which was in English with Dutch subtitles. This is perhaps the worse prison girl film I have seen to date.

The film centers on Susan (Susan Lee- lone film credit) whose mother and sister are both having an affair with the same doctor while her father is at home dying. She gets upset and strikes some boy with a bottle and winds up in reform school, run like a prison. Later she escapes with two friends and the plot becomes more inane with one of the worst black mailing schemes I have ever seen.

The girls in the film wear break away clothing, although the film is edited to prevent the viewer from seeing any nudity except for one quick butt scene. The girls shower behind a wooden partition that allows shoulder up, knee down voyeurism. The prison has a kindly guard and a straight female warden. Kudos for breaking with the cliche sadist guards and aggressive lesbian warden, but if they are not there, why the heck would we watch it?

The film has some MST camp material. I had to laugh at the disco scene. While the music was clearly a Bee Gees instrumental version of one of their songs, the young people dancing did not allow the music to influence how they moved. I need to apologize to my brother-in-law. He is not the worse drunk dancer in the world, although I still wish he would leave his shirt on.

I recommend passing on this film unless you are learning Dutch.",1390521600,,1485,4.448529411764706
