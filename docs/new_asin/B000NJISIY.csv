2769358,5,B000NJISIY,"The 1986-87 season,the third for the Cosby Show is exactly the same as the previous season,in the aspect of cast. The cast is still dancing but in different wardrobes and in a bluish-gray atmosphere to latin jazz music. It could have been Miami Sound Machine performing the new theme. Series star and co-creator Bill Cosby is acting a little bit sillier than before. Phylicia Rashad*(formerly Phylicia Ayers Allen) is rhythmically moving her feet wearing a black satin dress. Cosby and Rashad did do a little dance to latin jazz in the final scene of the season 1 episode RUDY'S SICK. Malcolm Jamal Warner rhythmically moves his feet. Sabrina LeBeauf and Tempest Bledsoe just stand still. Keshia Knight Pulliam moves her legs and feet and Cosby swings his right leg around her two-foot-tall body. We begin with BRING 'EM BACK ALIVE which premiered September 25,1986. Clair(Rashad) is terrified of a snake she finds in the Huxtables' kitchen. It hides out somewhere in their basement,seen for the first time. After the flabbergasting news of a high cholesterol-stricken friend,Cliff(Cosby) attempts to reduce his,via 35-calorie rice cakes. In GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY,Cliff's parents celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary and Clair plays a record with the late great James Brown's I GOT THE FEELIN' on it. Cliff's father Russell(Earle Hyman,recurringly) reflects about a similar experience with the late Ray Charles' NIGHT TIME IS THE RIGHT TIME from a season 2 episode. Other highlights include Cliff celebrating his fiftieth birthday,Theo(MJW) and his buddy Walter ""Cockroach"" Bradley(Carl Anthony Payne II,recurringly) about to shave their heads to appear in a rock video(Walter shaves but not Theo although he had shaving cream on his head),Vanessa(Bledsoe) wearing make-up against Clair's authority,Rudy(KKP) bossing around her friend Kenny(Deon Richmond,recurringly,who debuts in this episode),Cliff wearing make-up while napping(courtesy of 7-year-old Rudy), and the cast visiting Hillman college where Denise(Lisa Bonet) is studying in the season finale. The Hillman scenes were filmed in Atlanta where it's actually located. Guest stars this season include Patricia Richardson(""Home Improvement""),Robert Culp who was Cosby's I Spy co-star,Sinbad,Gilbert Gottfried and Angela Bassett,to name a few. Bonet was written out as a regular after this season,as she went on to star in the spinoff A DIFFERENT WORLD. She would recur her character on TCS during seasons 4 and 5 and return as a regular for seasons 6 and 7. Sondra's(LeBeauf) boyfriend Elvin Tibidaux(Geoffrey Owens,recurringly) is seen again this season. The other episodes are great. *Phylicia Ayers Allen married football great Ahmad Rashad on December 14,1985. She was credited as Phylicia Rashad after their wedding.",1171843200,11,2781,5.592417061611374

2769391,5,B000NJISIY,"My husband and I were newly married back in 1984 when this series first aired. Thursday nights were definitely the ""must see"" TV people talk about primarily due to this show. We rarely missed an episode and when we weren't going to be home, we recorded it on our VCR (remember those?).

Fast forward many years and with a daughter added to our family, we bought these in 2007 and watched the first three seasons again. Just a few weeks ago, we pulled out season 1 and laughed our way through it and then contintinued on through season 2. This past weekend we finished Season 3 and what a joy it was to know there are five more seasons to go.  My daughter is 17, my husband 55, and I am 50 -- a wide range of ages and yet all of us are laughing from beginning to end and appreciating what a comic genius Bill Cosby is. The cast is incredible, the characters full of quirks and personality, the writing is stupendous.

If you haven't seen these before and are looking for good, clean fun give them a try. If you saw these years ago, give them another go since this is definitely a series that has stood the test of time.",1338249600,,1118,4.23943661971831

2769393,5,B000NJISIY,The early seasons of The Cosby Show are always great!  One of the many things I like about this show is that Bill Cosby doesn't have all the funny lines.  The whole cast has the opportunity to bring laughs to the show.,1326758400,,218,4.166666666666667

2769396,5,B000NJISIY,"Bill Cosby's genius once again shines through. The cast works very well together--especially when Bill starts ""freestyling.""",1280793600,,124,6.352941176470588
2769397,4,B000NJISIY,"Season three's box set triumphantly says ""still the greatest"" but is this box set the greatest? The answer to that is...no. Urban Works really didn't put much effort into this set,  the Cosby Show deserves first rate treatment but it seems like Urban Works just thought, ""hey, I know let's not put the slightest bit of effort into these DVD's, I know the fans won't care either."" Well they were wrong, after a stellar season two release my expectations were high for the release of season three but it's obviously not enough effort was put into this set. There isn't one bonus feature, and there aren't any episode descriptions, only each episodes title. It gets a little frustrating having to guess what episode you're looking for by the title. And the last disappointment were the DVD cases, there all slim cases with each disc in one case, I enjoyed seeing photographs of the actors on the previous releases but...sigh...I guess it's not too big of a deal. But like season two, there aren't any edited episodes, so I can't really hate on this release.

Season three had some great episodes if you ask me,  a really funny one that I can recall is ""Planning Parenthood"", Cliff decides to take Rudy, Kenny and some of her other friends to a fancy restaurant. Kenny is hysterical and this is one of my favorite episodes that includes Kenny.  Another one I absolutely love is ""I Know That You Know"", I won't get into the synopsis but I just had to say how great this episode was. Now earlier in my review I mentioned how there aren't any episode descriptions so I'll list them below.

To sum up this review, this release of season three was a disappointment but as long as I can watch the episodes and have some laughs whenever I feel like it, I'm satisfied.",1280448000,5,4709,4.572619047619048
2769398,5,B000NJISIY,"Season three starts out with the very pregnant Phylicia Rashad (Clair).  She spent much of this season in short scenes sitting behind something or laying in bed to hide her pregnancy.  Once she comes back full time, the series comes alive again.  Her absence did allow for some very good work by the other characters.  It just keeps getting better.  I look forward to buying the remainder of this series.",1269043200,,404,4.714285714285714
2769399,4,B000NJISIY,"It was during this season of the show that the close knit dynamic of the show began to slowly break apart and split off into different directions. For one the show loses one of it's original cast members as Dennise (Lisa Bonet) leaves the household for collage. She's included in the show's theme song but appears only in a handfull of episodes. Either way however this season is filled with some excellent episodes that are very funny. One of is ""Bald And Beautiful"",in which Cockroach ends up shaving his head when he and Theo believe they are to appear in a video by a rock band called The Manniquins. Another great Theo and Cockroach episode is ""Theo's Flight"" where the pair,inspired by a heroic story of the Tuskeegee Airmen become infatuated with flying and actually are commited to it until the learn about the financial logistics of the matter and decide (wisely) to concentrate on growing up. This also features the first appearance of Kenny (known to Rudy as ""bud"") and the beginning of their teasingly funny relationship. ""Golden Anniversary"" kind of replicates the the family dance routine only it's James Brown's ""I Got The Feelin"" now and Theo gets a chance to showcase some fancy footwork and is more the star of this show than Rudy was in the last;she basically replicates her miming ""Baby baby baby"" here. It's hard to watch this season without being aware of Phylicia Rashad's pregancy. Her frequent and convenient absenses from many of the episodes didn't make the same impression on me as all the methods used to hide her widening stomach in the episodes she was in-including the infamous ""giant teddy bear"" scene. ""Vanessa's Rich"" actually brings up a very important point in an entertaining way. Even my own family I've heard this show as promoting an affluent black family lifestyle (then known as ""buppies"") throughout it's run and that's exactly the situation the growing Vanessa faces in this episodes. It is explained very well to her by Clair that the Huxtables work hard for what they have and that ""rich"" is actually better defined as the ""money working for you"". ""Say Hello To A Good Buy"" features the first appearance of Sinbad,later from<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Different-World/dp/B0009HBPEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Different World</a>&nbsp;as a car salesman as Cliff educates Theo as to the finer points of bargaining. Also of note this season is ""Cliff's 50'th Birthday"" where his kids present him with a list of things older than him which,by the way includes dirt. ""The March"" is another classic episode dealing with the written-word-versus reality of the 1963 march on Washington and,sometimes it's best to receive the nuances of history from someone who experienced it as opposed to the printed word-a wonderful creative detour from Bill Cosby's usual abvocacy of ""traditional"" acedemia but still very in keeping with the families cultural experiences. ""The Shower"" address's through one of Dennise's friends the issue of teen pregnancy-as blackmail,in the case in order to get married. So this season leans more toward ""issue"" episodes which find the kids especially dealing with mildly more grown up issues but in an entertaining fasion. The final episode ""Hillman"",while something of a hint at Lisa Bonet's forthcoming spin off series set at the fictional school is one of the weaker episodes of the show-having more to do with the changing over of school presidents and a lot of footage without dialog than the Huxtable family itself. The most involving scene is Clair singing in the school choir but it still seems mildly like a filler episode. While this season doesn't quite have the warmth and ammusing quality throughout that the first two Cosby seasons did it's still a great part of the shows legacy.",1267488000,,3803,5.125603864734299
2769400,5,B000NJISIY,"Even though the Cosby Show is around 20 years old, it's still one of the best sit-coms ever. Bill Cosby is hilarious - a comic genius. His reactions to events are so spontaneous and creative. I haven't seen another comic quite like him. Best of all, the show's plots are both family-friendly and funny. Unlike modern sit-coms, the characters don't curse and talk about sex every other scene. Rather the episodes are centered around family dramas that are realistic but always resolved well. The cast includes everybody from Phylicia Rashad as the tough and very intelligent Mrs. Huxtable, to the young and adorable Rudy. This makes the show accessible to a wide range of audiences.

The only thing that bothers me is that you have to keep hitting the ffw on your remote to get to the next episode, they don't just follow after each other. But that's ok, my daughter figured it out and we can watch each succeeding episode w/o having to go back to the main menu.",1206748800,2,386,4.025974025974026

2769411,5,B000NJISIY,"Even though i'm only 17, i grew up watching the re-runs of The Cosby Show, and i could watch it over and over again. I love the humor, but also the sense of family values that is displayed. Excellent show in my opinion.",1205798400,2,219,4.116279069767442
2769412,4,B000NJISIY,"I actually find this season quite a joy to view.  The reason I only give it four stars is the diminished presance of Phylicia Rahsad on camera.  [It's almost as if you see more of Denise, the Hillman freshman, than you do of Clair.]  Even knowing that she was on maternity restriction carrying then-husband Ahmad's fourth child doesn't really make up for the absence of Clair Huxtable during the middle part of the season.  Although, I've got to admit, the tricks they played to mask her pregnancy are pretty charming, in retrospect.

Having gotten past that issue, this set still includes some of my favourite moments in the whole series (""Food for Thought,"" ""Cliff In Charge,"" ""Rudy Spends the Night,"" ""Calling Dr. Huxtable,"" ""The Shower,"" ""I know that You Know"" and ""Bald and Beautiful.""  Also of significant note is the season finale, ""Hillman,"" in which all seven Huxtables convine at Dr. & Mrs. Huxtable's alma mater (which never really existed) to honor its retiring president (Joe Seneca guesting).  There, we hear Clair soloing with the college choir (I believe that's really Phylicia's voice).  Partly on the heels of this episode, we see the creation of a spinoff show, A Diffeent World, which takes place right there at Hillman College.

I actually found the menu-diving very comprehensive and had no trouble navigating the options.  And, the dual-act set-up is ideal, when there's a specific piece of an episode you want to see (such as the latter half of ""You Only Hurt the Ones You Love"").  Then again, I've only liked playing individual episodes.  (If you want to jump from one to the next, you can just hit fast-forward on your remote.)  I would've liked to see a bonus section, containing commentary or season bloopers, as with Season 2.  But, what can you do?  Jay Sandrich and company can only do so much at once.",1204243200,2,1833,4.81150159744409
2769413,5,B000NJISIY,"I am a die-hard fan of ""The Cosby Show.""  I always have been and always will be!  I read a few reviews that talked about how the DVD packages weren't too great for episodes 3 and 4.  While I respect the opinions of others, I wanted to voice my own.  My case for season one has already broken and one of the DVD's isn't secure.  I LOVE how they packaged seasons 3 and 4.  Each DVD is in it's own case in seasons 3 and 4 and each case is inside a slip cover.  The first two seasons are all packaged in a slip cover and are in the same case.  While I don't mind that, if anything breaks in the cover for seasons one and two, they are much harder to replace.  And I get to risk my DVD getting scratched because it's ""floating around"" in the case.  With seasons 3 and 4, if something breaks in the case, no problem.  I just run to Wal-Mart and grab a replacement case, move the label from the old case to the new one, and then place the DVD in the new case.  So, I personally really like the way they have done the last few seasons.  In my opinion, they are much better done than the first few seasons.  I also really like the menu.  None of the menus have bothered me though, so I don't really have an opinion on that one.  Anyhow, ""The Cosby Show"" is the best!  It always will be number one in my mind!!!",1191974400,2,1301,3.9613899613899615

2769425,1,B000NJISIY,"C'mon ""Cosby Police."" You know who you are. The ones who are compelled to silent my reviews of ""The Great Cosby Show,"" because I dare to call it as I see it. So...I find it amusing that my original review of this drek of a program was muted- I'm sure there's some PC monitors who found it offensive that anyone dared to diss the great Cosby Show. That was actually part of the point of my original review. It was praised for it's ""wholesomeness, great role models for African Americans"" during a decade of Eddie Murphy type comedy, etc. But none of that makes this a good, much less great show. This has all the appeal of ""Full House,' minus the ""You got it dudes."" So it is worthy of sitting the kiddies in front of the TV to watch. How any adult could stomach it, especially in hindsight amazes me to this day. It's full of ""Awwwww"" type cutesiness, endless pounding of ad-nauseum scholastical preachiness, and feel good fashion statements, as it were. All of which perfectly fits the mold of ""The Brady Bunch."" In fact, this show is the Brady Bunch of the 1980s (compare the 2 series and prove me wrong). It's a meandering, pandering, suck up of a show that is funny only to those who are laughing before the show even begins. It typifies the other over rated, unfunny sitcoms of the 80s that were celebrated because TV had to hand out awards to someone. So why not hand it to the wholesome Huxtables, no matter how hammy, saccharine, predictable, redundant and horribly written and acted it is. This is the most over rated ""comedy"" in the history of TV. Don't waste your time or money. You want the best Cosby comedy ever with lessons and morals to boot, buy the ""Fat Albert"" cartoon series. It was actually funny. This one is just plain corny, predictable,  sappy, and so sweet it hurts your teeth. And Phylicia Rashad brings to TV the most annoying character since Granny Clampet of  ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The fact that this show was number one for so long is an indictment of how much garbage TV is able to cram down viewers throats- a testament to P.T. Barnum's ""there's a sucker born every minute."" Remember, ""Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" too were huge ratings winners. So much for ratings.",1187481600,,2207,4.542713567839196

I could care less about the packaging, but Menu options such as Play All are necessary when multiple episodes are involved.  I like the slim packaging.

2769429,4,B000NJISIY,"To the best of my knowledge, this is the complete collection of The Cosby Show: Season Three. I'm a big fan of the show, and I'm thrilled by the compilation.

My only complaint is the actual ability to maneuver through the screens. Selecting the episodes (which have no name on the tv screen, so you need to keep the box handy) can get tedious. You need to flip through each episode and each of its acts before you can select the episode of your choice. Additionally you need to remember to turn the subtitles off, since they automatically run.

With the exception of the subtitles, there aren't any special features to this DVD collection.

However, it's still the Cosby Show, and I think that for most people, it'll still all be worth it.",1184112000,10,740,4.548872180451128
2769430,4,B000NJISIY,"I am happy that the powers at be decided to continue releasing The Cosby Show.  However, it is my opinion that this set was not given as much attention or care as the first two seasons.  For instance, there are no extras, no ""Play All"" feature, not even episode descriptions inside the package!  At least the episodes continue to be uncut.

As for the shows themselves, they are great, with clean humor and light family fun.  I liked the episode ""Theo's Flight,"" and the others are good as well.  Overall I am happy to own this set, because in the end the episodes are what counts.

I do recommend buying this set.  It could've been better, but the episodes are very funny.  Also one must take into account that if we (the fans) don't contine to support the series the studios won't release it at all next time.",1184112000,5,811,4.425675675675675
2769431,2,B000NJISIY,"This season they have changed a couple of things.  First, no funny bloopers on the last disc like seasons past.  Second, you can no longer select a ""PLAY ALL"" option.  That is a very bad decision if you ask me.  Every TV show DVD should have that.  I like to sleep with the TV set on a timer at night.  And I'll play an entire TV show disc.  You can't do that when they remove the entire option like they did with this season.  Lastly, they changed the type of case.  It is no longer a fold out gate box.  It's 3 mini thin DVD cases in a slip case.  Not that that's bad, but I hate it when they do that when earlier seasons were different.  Your collection will not be uniform.  So despite this being a great show.  The lack of effort all of a sudden is easliy noticable.  They wen't ""cheap"" on us.  Cosby Show deserves better than this.",1183507200,26,837,4.074074074074074
