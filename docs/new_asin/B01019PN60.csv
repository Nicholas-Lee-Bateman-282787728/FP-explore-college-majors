8721253,3,B01019PN60,"The Vinegar Syndrome DVD authoring group continue their parade of vintage re-releases of obscure Adult films with a sampling of 80's weirdness from porn-meister: Phil Prince.  Prince operated out of New York in the 70s/80s and is noted for producing particularly low budget 'violent' XXX product. This offering of 3 short (approx. 40 min. each) features definitely confirms that reputation!

All of the 'films' included in this set would likely be considered as 'roughies' by grindhouse standards as they contain a bit of light weight S/M action and 'roughing up' women (and men).  The content of all 3 of the flix is fully hard-core XXX featuring lotsa the old 'in-and-out', BJs, and girl/girl action - performed by Prince's 'stable' of thespians who show up in all of the movies, in different guises.

The plot of ""Savage Sadists"" begins with a juxtaposition of two different sets of action: two men break into an apartment and harass a woman, at gun-point, demanding information on the whereabouts of her husband and ultimately rape her - while, elsewhere, the 'husband' (who is a porn movie distributor) is having sex with a 'thick' bodied girl dressed like a disco queen in a sequined dress and top hat!  Ultimately the two parties come together at the husband's office and the 'bad guys' proceed to have sex with all the women present while the husband cowers under his desk.  The most attractive girl (in any of the movies) has a hot Latina look (she's the one that is shown in 2 of the images on the DVD box cover!) and she gets tied up to an X frame cross and 'tormented' a bit - until the 'husband' finally grabs the gun away from the bad guys and turns the tables.

""Den of Dominance"" has the 'husband' actor from the previous flik now portraying a patron at a bar who hires a hooker (the cute Latina girl, again!) and 'does her' right on the floor! before going into the 'back room' where things get a little kinkier with a bit of tying up prior to, yet more, screwing.

The final offering: ""Daughters of Discipline""  begins with two sisters getting turned on looking at a BDSM magazine which inspires them to eat each other out in a lengthy girl/girl scene and then phone up a male friend to 'help them out'.  After a little standard sex with him they tie him up (to the same X frame from 'Savage Sadists') and start to 'torture' him a bit - but - their parents! suddenly return home whence the 'dad' demands a BJ from his daughters.  Talk about 'sick & twisted'!

Despite a lot of hard-core activity, and 'period' kink, I found the viewing experience to be kinda so-so. The women (with the exception of the aforementioned Latina cutie) were all about C+ in the attractiveness department. Lots of big frizzy hair (everywhere)and zero acting skills. The 'production values' were nil and the carnal 'action' was fairly mundane standard fare. On the 'plus' side - the visual quality of the film transfers was very good (the 'hallmark' of the Vinegar Syndrome product!).  Over-all - an amusing viewing experience from an 'archival' perspective but not super 'hot'.  All 3 films presented in color - fullscreen mode - no extras.",1442793600,11,3136,4.709323583180987
