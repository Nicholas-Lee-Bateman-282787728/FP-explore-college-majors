8611907,3,B00F3HZBHW,"I waited for years for a movie called Worst Case Scenario to be released. The trailers were awesome, the concept was unique and fun sounding. Unfortunately that film never got made, so the creature designs were transferred over Frankenstein's Army. The creatures are the true stars in this movie and are very well done. As far the movie goes, I was disappointed for the most part. I felt it could have done so much more with the source material and it really didn't need to be a found footage film. I figured the creatures that were made into the figures would have a bigger role than the do. Mosquito Man is basically the poster monster for this movie and thus has more screen time, but the other two are barely in the movie for more than 5 minutes.",1383782400,2,750,4.442028985507246
