8486095,5,B005TEKEYE,"Beautifully made and portraying that era of Hong Kong with fact-based nostalgia. So meaningful to have a glimpse of Bruce Lee's upbringing and early adulthood, without making it into just a fighting movie. Great acting from many actors! Fantastic job--- thank you!",1410134400,,264,5.309523809523809

8486097,5,B005TEKEYE,"This was a good story of the Lee family and Bruce's exposure to theater and film prior to the Bruce that we all came to love. This movie is not a martial arts movie, while it's there, it's more of a dramatic narrative. I have no clue how accurate any of this movie is, but it was a good movie nonetheless.",1389916800,,305,4.016393442622951
8486098,5,B005TEKEYE,Bruce Lee My Brother was an excellent history of young Bruce before he came to the United States and it would be great if there was a  sequel.,1335916800,,142,4.071428571428571
