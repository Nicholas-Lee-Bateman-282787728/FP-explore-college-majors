8308120,5,B001H8QFLC,"I couldn't disagree more with another reviewer's criticism of this film as being ""sort of misleading"". I absolutely loved this DVD, from beginning to end. I actually just received my law school acceptance letter and sought this film in the hope of getting some insight as to what I might expect, and I was more than satisfied with what I saw. It's candid, realistic and very honest about the challenges that law school students face. I also love that the film surrounds the actual LIVES of these men and women - all of whom are different ages and are from different walks of life - and you get to go home with them, meet their families, hear about their backgrounds, see them study and interact with one another, experience their fears and anxieties. The whole vibe is something like you'd have seen on MTV in the 90's: fresh, raw, unscripted, realistic. And while the majority of the film is, in fact, based on their first year...that's all anyone's really interested in anyway! The first year is the most exciting, the most challenging, the most exhilarating, and the period of time during which nearly all of your lasting memories are made - so as a soon-to-be 1L student, I'm glad to have had the chance to see others' experiences and how they managed. The film ends with graduation and updates on everyone's progress, and some made it early while others took a bit longer, but everyone in the film eventually goes on to pass the bar and is practicing law in one fashion or another.

There is another bonus section of the DVD that has about 2-hours of interviews from lawyers, judges, professors and other legal professionals. They discuss the whole law school process, what happens in the classroom, how students get along and interact, how law school is NOT as competitive as believed, life after law school, entertaining stories from their own lives, and other wits of wisdom.

This DVD was well worth the money I spent for it. I thought it was remarkably charming, the students were really easy to relate to, and I thought it gave an honest take on what law school is really like. For some hotshot know-it-all, this probably isn't the film for you - but for me, it was awesome. I highly recommend it for any entering law school student, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did :)",1351209600,,2286,4.614250614250614
8308121,3,B001H8QFLC,"I thought it was more descriptive. i felt like i was watching ""true life, im a 1L student"". it mostly focused on the hard work and miserable hours during finals. personally, i was not impressed.",1272844800,,194,4.571428571428571
8308122,5,B001H8QFLC,"This was a fantastic movie. It really answers a lot of questions a potential law student would think about. The move follows several students through their first year in law school at the University of Oklahoma. The majority of the movie is based on the first semester of the students law school experience, but they do go a little more in depth closer to the end on the rest of the year and after they all graduate. Which I personally thought was very neat.

The movie itself isn't very long (80-90 minutes). But there is over two additional hours of Q&A and advice from deans and professors from all over the country (UNC, Harvard, Yale, Emory, and many more) in the bonus features of the DVD.

If you're considering law school, I highly recommend watching this film. It was made for everyone really. From fresh out of high school students, people who have taken a few years off to gain work experience, to parents with children trying to make it through the experience, etc.
Very good movie.",1234742400,2,994,4.610169491525424
8308123,4,B001H8QFLC,"The description of this film is sort of misleading in that it says that this documentary follows several law students through their first year of law school. In reality, it is only the students' first semester that is presented. In addition, the film has interviews with staff from various law schools interspersed in it. This is a good idea, but I think too much time is allocated for this. I liked this film, but expected more. It's only 87 minutes!",1232236800,4,451,4.65
