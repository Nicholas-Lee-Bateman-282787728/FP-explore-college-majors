2798751,5,B000OPPAE2,"The addition of ""The Two of Us"" to the Criterion Collection disappoints only in having taken too long to come to fruition.  Besides the justly celebrated film, we are given a booklet containing an appreciative review by critic emeritus David Sterritt and autobiographical excerpts by Francois Truffaut and the film's director, Claude Berri, together with the usual acknowledgments, scene titles, and cast listing.  Extras on the DVD include Berri's Oscar-winning short, ""Le Poulet,"" historical clips of veteran actor Michel Simon--the old man--and contemporary interviews with Berri and with Alain Cohen who played the child and who is instantly recognizable forty years later.  It is a splendid store, and students who are assigned--as they will be-- criticisms to write will find everything they need and more for plagiarizing.

All this and the movie, too!  Simon, Cohen and Berri have been amply praised by critics with stronger credentials than my own, so I will allow the interviews and the film to speak for me.  What higher praise for the acting than this from Berri: ""If you have to direct, you've chosen the wrong actor.""  How better to summarize the film in one line than by the child's question before he meets the old man: ""Why doesn't he like Jews if he is nice?""  The old man is all that a surrogate grandfather should be: empathetic, loving, comforting, and playful.  ""I'll teach you myself,"" he says when the boy is cruelly treated at school, and teach him he does, from an abundant store of misinformation and prejudice, which the boy pumps from him with the impudent certainty that it is all nonsense.

When the village children and their teacher are cruel, it is casual cruelty to a stranger from Paris, not to one of the hated Jews.  The war is there, too, with propaganda from the radio, rationing, and overhead bombers, and we are aware, as the child is not, of the devastating consequences should he forget his Catholic prayer, his false name, or the need to dress and bathe in private.  Berri, in his interview, says that amidst much suffering, it was possible to be happy during the war, as he was and as is the child in the movie.  It is no less an indictment of racism that these two escape its tragic consequences.

I don't speak French, but the subtitles are more than adequate.  The dialogue isn't irrelevant, but most of the time the situation is more than clear with no dialogue at all.",1183248000,15,2419,4.809178743961352

2798760,5,B000OPPAE2,"The Bottom Line:

An endearing and unmanipulative little film about a French Jewish boy sent to live with a slightly curmudgeonly old Christian man and his wife, The Two of Us is a delightful addition to the mostly-depressing (for obvious reasons) list of films about the Holocaust and makes a fine companion piece to the earlier French offering Forbidden Games.

2798762,5,B000OPPAE2,"This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Hardly any film I've watched before or since has resonated with me as much as this film did.

Story-
During the occupation of France during the big one, a Jewish boy is being far too wild for his parents to control.  He doesn't quite grasp the gravity of what Nazism means and rightly so he's just a kid.  To protect him, his family sends him to live with their landlords father.  The old man who he lives with is very anti-Semitic.  They form an incredible bond together and truly show that it doesn't matter who or what you believe its all about human connection.  I can't quite put it into words how well the little boy and older man execute their roles is phenomenal.

Presentation-
Criterion gave their excellent treatment to this film.  Shown in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1.  There is hardly any grain or pixelation to speak of.  The clarity of the print is excellent and definition is superb.

Sound-
Everything comes through very clear.  There is very little clicks or hiss in the audio track.  Excellent.

Extras-
One of Criterion's trademarks there's boatloads.  So many I'm not even going to name them all.  Some of the highlights however would be some documentaries, a short film, commentaries and the usual booklet that accompanies most Criterion films this time with an essay and some of Berri's(the director) memoirs.

Excellent, superb, lovely.",1236038400,7,1423,4.738775510204082
2798763,5,B000OPPAE2,This is a wonderful film. It is in French with Engilsh sub titles. It takes place in German occupied France. A young couple send their 8 yr old boy to the country to stay with the land ladies parents. He has to keep his secret that he is a jew and pretend to be at Catholic. The old man is so funny and so in love with his old dog that he feeds at the table from a spoon. The couple are so kind to the boy. The child has fears and is not treated too well by the other children but the old man is is friend. It is just touching and leaves you feeling good in the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves War time stories.,1216252800,3,626,3.786259541984733
2798764,5,B000OPPAE2,"The guy who played the old man wasn't summoned from a nearby street corner.  Revered actor Michel Simon comfortably inhabits the character of Pepe.  Simon was a veteran of over 100 performances, dating back to Carl Dreyer's late-'20s cinematic tone poem The Passion of Joan of Arc.  Long beloved of French audiences by the time this film was made:  this isn't the final role in his career but among his later ones.

An inestimable moment among many is Pepe and Mm's passive-aggressive struggle over possibly being late to Mass.  The husband's blessedly irascible indifference frustrates his wife's attempts to ""help"" (i.e. meddle) with the child's bathing (not ill-intentioned, but hardly motivated by motherly care).  Serendipitously, this helps Claude maintain privacy not only for his body, but also his identity.  It's an amusing vignette:  but had things happened only a little bit differently, this could have been a matter of life and death.  Note the subtlety of the performance from the boy (Alain Cohen), particularly his watchful eyes, and how--until one crucial moment--he takes care to conceal himself without calling too much attention to the fact.

Not certain why The Two of Us was chosen over the film's original title, which translates literally as The Old Man and the Child (Le vieil homme et l'enfant).  But could either have more aptly reflected--in their simplicity--the charm of this story?

Consider the following.  Who hasn't struggled with this?  Think of that acquaintance or co-worker (we all know at least one)--who occasionally spews venom toward a traditionally-despised class--yet is typically so cheerful, so seemingly nice.  WHAT to do??  Tell them you're offended?  You suspect they're unlikely to change, and--if you do speak out--neither of you will be comfortable talking with one another ever again.  How would this be of benefit for anyone?  But in remaining silent, do you implicitly approve of bigotry?

SPOILER ALERT -- In dual reviews (one from the time of the theatrical release, one recently), Roger Ebert explores this dilemma.  He argues convincingly that The Two of Us would have been a less satisfying film had the plot taken a more-predictable course, such as:  the old man accidentally learns of the boy's heritage, and is forced to reassess his prejudices.  What an improbable ""conversion,"" intended to please (read:  pander to) the audience in their desire for simplicity of a different kind.

In this story, young Claude is the character who changes.  Had he not learned forgiveness toward those who fail to understand him entirely, his life would have been more frustrating, and it seems likely he would have made fewer friends.",1210291200,3,2684,5.181395348837209
2798765,5,B000OPPAE2,"A lovely story, rich with characters that stay with you.  Good (important) for the whole family to see.",1207526400,,103,4.722222222222222
2798766,5,B000OPPAE2,"I had heard the ""The Two of Us"" is a great movie and I was not oversold; it IS a great movie!  It gives us a personal look Occupied France, anti-Semitism, and the needs of two people who have lost their connections.  The way the movie brings these two characters, an old man and a boy, together is intelligently done.  Once they're united, the movie really takes off.

The boy is a Jewish child from Paris whose mischeviousness seems to draw a lot of attention to himself; just what his parents don't need.  The opportunity comes to send him to live with the elderly parents of a friend in the countryside near Grenoble.  The elderly man is most definitely NOT Jewish.  Our young hero finds himself alone in a strange place.  The old man can't understand or even abide his children and he and his wife seem to spend much of their time in disagreement with one another.  Our elderly hero finds himself alone in a familiar place.  They readily take to each other and the beauty of the film is how it portrays the genisis and growth of their relationship.  There is much that is said about the time and place that this film took place in.  However, the extremes of France in 1944 merely serve as an amplifier to the story of a most unusual friendship.

The acting and directing were superb in ""The Two of Us"".  To be honest, I won't remember the names but I WILL remember their preformances.  I kept wondering where did they find the guy who plays the old man.  You have to see him to believe him yet his acting is outstanding (not just another funny face).  The boy is endearing and the way they evolve together is even more so.  This movie is a masterpiece of joy.",1205539200,3,1663,4.379084967320262

8186102,4,B000OPPAE2,"We saw this excellent French film on Christmas Day, a tradition in New York City, and found it very moving. My wife -- a true Parisian who grew up during World War Two, was especially moved because so many details resonated -- the death of the dog, the disgrace of Petain, the shaven heads of collaborators, the tensions and lessons of the ""Four Main Enemies of France"" -- not including the Germans.

I was deeply impressed with the directors work on this movie -- very real to my country boy eyes -- and avoiding a cliched ending where the old man learns the real identity of the boy.

8186103,5,B000OPPAE2,"A beautiful and admittedly sentimental film that has great heart. The two central performances (the old man and the boy) can only be described as miraculous.

8186106,5,B000OPPAE2,"I saw this movie when it was first released 45 years ago. - enjoyed it - but was not overwhelmed.  Having seen thousands of films later, I selected the film to see again...and was bowled over.  I notice things differently now that I am over 60.  Today, I would rank this among my favorite movies of all time.

World War II France under the Occupation. The movie begins with a young Jewish boy getting constantly in trouble in Paris, but his parents are in hiding.  By drawing attention to himself, he puts his mother and father at risk. The father is furious, and justly so, but the mother is overprotective and loving, no matter what.  The solution is to send him to the South of France with a different family and with a different name to wait out the war.

I have to say I empathize with the father.  Trivial behavior did end up in disaster for Jews in France.  But this is not really the center of the film at all.  As the other reviews indicate, it is about an improbable friendship between the boy and the old man whom he is sent to live. Partners in mischief, perhaps...they develop a beautiful friendship.  The old man needs someone to talk to and the boy needs a comforting father figure.  The irony is that the man is an anti-semite with ridiculous prejudices and the young boy is (secretly) a Jewish boy. But the love of a father figure and a young boy that they depict is so real.

The strength of the picture? The cinematography is splendid...the choice of natural sounds of the woods or the music is equally good. But it is the performances of the two that makes this a GREAT picture.  Both are absolute naturals in their roles. The man with the silly ideas about Jews but otherwise loveable personality is brilliantly captured by Michel Simone. And Alain Cohen is undoubtedly playing himself...a kind, affectionate young boy with a penchant for mischief.  It is hard not to be captivated.

In so many ways, this film does NOT follow the typical trope of Silas Marner wannabees - grumpy old man who learns kindness by taking care of a child (See ""The Butterfly"", ""Kolya"", ""Despicable Me"" for examples). The man does not change...he is a decent man, very kind to animals, but who has every wrong idea about liberals, Jews, politics.  The  boy enjoys poking fun at these.

The ending feels real without being forced.  I simply cannot praise the performances enough.  What is missing in so many films today is ""charm."" This movie has it - all the way",1388102400,4,2461,4.535147392290249
8186107,5,B000OPPAE2,"I adore Michel Simon... this DVD is a classic I watch several times per year.  It is a heartwarming story and so very French.  Even though Michel's character is a bigot he is almost laughable (and loveable); he unknowingly showers so much affection on this little boy (whom he does not know is an object of his bigotry) as he hides him (unwittingly) from the Nazis.  I love Michel's character's relationship with his wife....'Mm, ma potion!! (alcohol, not medecine)', the scenes in front of the radio, the meals, the schoolyard teacher and kids, the education of the little Jewish boy by PP, and the love that develops between everyone.  It us fun to sing the soldier's marching song along with the movie... 'Vive Le Pinard!'  PP's dog, Kinou, is another star!  Even vegetarianism is dealt with (PP doesn't want the little boy to eat MM's rabbits... he calls a meat eater a cannibal.  I think even Kinou is a vegetarian.",1384560000,,920,4.7125
8186108,5,B000OPPAE2,"What a masterpiece! I highly encourage you to watch it. So few characters, but such a gem of a movie! Cinematography and photography were superb, and think how old the production is! The script lacks pretensions and the younger casts outdid themselves. I particularly liked the young girl, and have been touched by her innocent eyes and affectionate smile.
The relationship between a grumpily happy old man and a precocious child has been drawn with so much sympathy and the greatest skill of the director is this: to be able to hold the shadow of a great war over the lives of few simple French villagers, yet, to show their moments of pure joy and happiness, their spontaneous humanity, without minimizing war's trauma. Through the intelligence and innocence of a child, the movie asks fundamental questions that make us alert about our presumptions and suppositions about others we do not know.
The end remains kind of unfinished, like many touching short stories.
Again, watch it.",1380412800,,984,4.96969696969697
8186109,5,B000OPPAE2,"I just love the movie, very meaningful.  I showed it to my high school students, the vice principal also saw part of it and said it was ""too controversial.""

8186111,2,B000OPPAE2,"A Parisian Jewish lad is sent to the country during WWII, easily conceals his ethnicity, and returns home at war's end.  Between his going and coming is a sequence of vignettes that become increasingly tiresome and meaningless.  None of the characters gains anything in the way of wisdom, understanding, or wiles.
Michel Simon is outstanding as the old man who gives the boy a temporary refuge, but Alain Cohen, as the youthful protagonist, appears to lack the ability to carry off the demands of his role.  Or maybe the director intended his semi-autobiographical character to smile vapidly 90% of the time.  Or maybe this English-speaking American reviewer just doesn't get it.  Indeed, nearly every frame of this feature is full of subtitles, resulting in likely fatigue for a non-French-speaking viewer.  There's nothing in the narrative to break the tedium, and thus the movie's 87 minutes seem much longer.  In truth, not every story bears repeating.",1349049600,3,956,5.129032258064516
