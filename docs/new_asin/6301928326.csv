which should be digitally restored and issued on DVD and this certainly is one of them. Is there anybody out there ???",1372550400,8,236,4.1521739130434785

393575,5,6301928326,"I saw this in 1989 roughly when it had come out on VHS. (I was from U.K then) never heard about it. Just browsing in local video rental shop and the dude behind counter recommended this film, and i liked the story write up on the back. :-) Enough to grab my interest.
Went home, lit the fire, and settled down (friday night home alone..)an hour and a half later to be totally blown away. Brilliant film. Sure, a little flaw and cheese here and there but overall it delivered. At times, the emotions of native american past come to the fore in a spectacular way. Even though i am English, i felt almost ashamed to be white. Embarrassed even. Sure, they (natives) were not pure but lets face it, white european society then and now, has a lot to answer for.
I have a keen interest in native Americans stemming from when i was a kid. I am 47 now.
I cannot for the life of me understand why this film was not more popular. A lot of my friends i showed film to were amazed and had never heard of it. It wasn't exactly standout all those years ago on VHS video stores shelves either. I could easily have missed it then. I just remember asking the dude behind counter of recommendations. I knew him only from going in/out of store and chatting here and there. He saw my native indian tattoo (yes, a hot summer in U.K will present us in t shirts) LoL anyway, i made a calculated guess and took a punt. Suffice to say when i returned, i said if you want to sell this film, i will buy it! 6 weeks later he sold it to me for 20 pounds. Back then buying a top video was around 4 pounds i think. Maybe 5 pounds. I didn't care. I was well happy to get my hands on it.
Now, anyone reading this that has an interest in native americans and will appreciate the linking of past to present and prepared for some emotional roller coaster then get this film!!
I always remember the first time i saw it and i do not want to say anything about the ending but i shed some tears 1st time i saw it. Rarely (and i mean rarely) do i cry. Hell of a film.",1347494400,12,2025,4.090452261306533

393577,5,6301928326,"it's not easy and nice movie for view, relax and forget. Don't wait for the Hollywood's happy-end. It's tragic and not simply movie about racial prejudice which unfortunately still with us.",1315699200,,189,5.129032258064516
393578,5,6301928326,"Probably the first high-budget NDN film, War Party was really a first in many ways. It stepped past the whole ""let's portray Native people positively for once"" hurdle and went straight to ""let's portray Native people as people for once."" I wish I knew more of the story behind this script and production; all I know is that 1) Billy Wirth campaigned to get his role (which makes me wonder if they originally wanted to cast a more Indian Indian) and 2) the screenwriter died before the post-production was complete. So I don't know what the original vision was or what inspired it.

I must say, I have no idea how they got the money from a studio to make this...unless I'm underestimating the teen fans of Billy Wirth via The Lost Boys {possibly on par with how Twilight fans are flocking to see indie films featuring the two lead actors} at the time that probably carried it at the box office. And the ample money shows--even though the script was strong and most of the acting was quite good--the incredible production design, amazing [and expensive] photography, stunts/FX (like that awesome pre-CGI explosion), etc went far to make the sharply unconventional story so believable (once you suspend disbelief, of course). Black comedy + high drama + high quality production + gorgeous Montana location... The script is great (with some truly hilarious lines), the conflict is palpable, and the weird storyline really, amazingly works--as long as you watch the film for what it was/is.

I recently heard a mixed review from more recent viewers on the younger side who couldn't relate to the fantasy element of the story and could not get past the whole ""that would never happen"" thing. They felt that it wasn't `realistic' rez life conflict, and then I heard a teacher who was upset about `the message' conveyed by one of the twists in the plot. When it comes down to it, though, I think that if you don't appreciate the fact that the plot has a fantasy/experimental edge to it and that some of the scenes are *supposed* to be on the surreal side--or its black comedy elements--you're going to see a very different film altogether, and that film won't work so long as you're stuck outside the story and trying to deconstruct it. And while I don't want to give any spoilers, I do have to say that if you miss the whole unique `what if' fantasy nature of the entire plot, you'll miss the point of the ending--which is not meant to be romantic or melodramatic. I felt it was meant to provoke, not preach. I've heard that there was an alternative ending shot, but I'm glad it didn't go there.

It got shredded by critics when it came out for being `irresponsible' since the film didn't offer [patronizing] solutions for racial harmony (?!), but I would say that this in itself shows what the film succeeded in doing--its sheer craziness leaves viewers (so long as you accept the premise, of course) with a bunch of compelling questions and makes you think. It also failed to provide the typical alternative to the anti-Indian Western: a melodrama of the noble savage, and I guess that made people uncomfortable. It was something new altogether, and didn't tell you what to think. And there were few predictable character sketches, where stock characters played certain roles according to the script that you would have expected from a film about contemporary ndns. What I appreciated most is that there was really no objectifying even though many of the characters were . Many of the characters were complex and very few were 2-dimensional. You had everyone from a whiskey-chugging medicine man to a butt-kissing tribal council chair to a wimpy bounty tracker you can't bring yourself to hate--all of who *could* have been thin, lame characters--but instead felt unique. There were so many little character details that would have been cut from a standard Hollywood script that really made such an outwardly sensationalistic conflict truly complex and not black-and-white. What's more, you find yourself questioning each new turn of the plot, where you think you have it down and then realize that were this blown-out-of-proportion conflict to be translated into another context, you'd have it wrong. And somehow the film never got heavy-handed or in love with itself.

My only complaint: there is no way on earth that Dennis Banks and Tantoo Cardinal produced Billy Wirth, even in his heavy metal makeup (granted, they made a 1/8 dude look like a 1/2 blood dude (albeit half of the time)...but the makeup people should have at least tried to make Tantoo look part white if they were going to cast a big-part white dude. And Kevin Dillon, whose character is supposed to be [hilariously so] ""3/8ths"" Cheyenne is about 8/8ths Irish. But it's a small complaint considering that they both were really great in their roles once they settled in, and I can't imagine someone else carrying Kevin's awesome cheese factor (you know, that mostly white mixed dude who's more militant than the full bloods), which he totally makes work.

P.S. I have to point out that this was Saginaw Grant's first film, and he's pretty much awesome in it. He's genius enough that he makes this scene where he's laughing at a burning...erm...flag truly funny. Technically black comedy, but he had me cracking up in a great way...it was like ""Vindication, yo!"" (you have to see it to see what I mean).",1243728000,5,5367,4.816702819956616
393579,5,6301928326,"It is my understanding that this movie was filmed with another ending, which was in the original script. The ""other"" ending has the Governor surrendering to the Tribe. Of course, it ended up on the editing room floor. How about a DVD with this ending? Are you listening Corporate America?",1033344000,19,288,4.78

393581,4,6301928326,"Although not the best Billy Wirth or Kevin Dillon movie around, WAR PARTY is a good addition to most anyone's collection. Set on a desolate reservation town, it's main theme revolves around racial prejudice, as well as pride. Love and family ties into the plot to some degree, and there are several frames of beautiful scenery. And, although the script seems to drag a bit at times, the un-Hollywood finale is well worth the wait!",1002240000,15,430,4.746666666666667
7818605,5,6301928326,"This is a wonderful movie. It portrays the tension that still exists between Native Americans and some white people. It brings to mind the conflicts that are over 200 years old. Including Indian actors like Dennis Banks and Tantoo Cardinal who bring authenticity to the production, War Party was filmed in Montana and there are some beautiful scenes from Glacier National Park. One can feel the tension throughout the movie.

Why this is still not out on DVD is a total mystery. Whatever the problem is, it would be well worth everyone's while to make this available. Even though I have a VHS player (still), we all know that the quality of tapes cannot match most DVDs and also tapes start to disintegrate over time.

I didn't get my hopes up for this movie because it seems like whenever I do I end up being disappointed but it was pretty good so if you have a chance to watch it, I'd tell you to go for it.

7818611,5,6301928326,"I wish this movie would come out on DVD sometime. I think the different perspective of War Party is also due to the fact that Franc Roddam, the director is British and was able to pick up on this topic without the usual patriotic American point of view.
