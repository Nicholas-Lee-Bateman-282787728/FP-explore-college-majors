6355550,2,B00JEEZT68,"Has sweet intentions, but the film is ultimately uneven and doesn't quite come together. The acting is fairly good, with Jeff Goldblum being the scene-stealer, however the pace and writing is really what works against it being a better movie. Not worth seeing in theaters, but maybe a rental on a Sunday afternoon, but you will need very low expectations to enjoy it.",1397779200,3,367,4.841269841269841

6355562,1,B00JEEZT68,"Perhaps the British humor eluded me.  The understory between the husband and wife was over developed, And, while the major actors all worked their hardest, this film clearly missed the mark.  I expected a comedic romp, and got a sad tale of angst and frustration.  Paris was a great backdrop, but this film, for me, fell short of the mark.",1454457600,,339,4.616666666666666

6355586,2,B00JEEZT68,"While well acted, I did not enjoy this film.  The characters were unlikable, their bickering uncomfortable, and I didn't see any people I would want to spend an evening talking to or getting to know.  The plot was negligible (unhappy couple either trying to rekindle and save a relationship or to end it, depending on which person you speak about) and all their dirty laundry being flapped in the open air for all to see.  Unfortunately I didn't care about either of them enough to want to delve into the whys of how they became who they are at the time of the film.

6355589,2,B00JEEZT68,"Literally: my wife dozed off during the middle third. If it wasn't for the too brief synopsis of this movie (displayed when we were trying to decide whether or not to watch it), we would not have had a clue as to what the story line was about. Even the title was misleading; I expected a bit of a French farce. Not so. For most of the movie, I couldn't decide whether Nick was a self-centered jerk or Meg was a cold fish. By the end of the movie, I decided that Meg was a dominant individual in this pairing and Nick was deeply insecure. And they were down-at-the-heels due to some very poor life choices. I like Jim Broadbent, nor do I fault either he or his co-star. I think they turned in good performances given the material they were handed. I particularly didn't like the director's handling of the audio: it seemed that either Nick and Meg were whispering to each other or they were being filmed at a distance; in some scenes I wasn't even certain as to whom was speaking. There was one scene in a restaurant where I thought it was the people in the foreground who were talking; it took me a bit of time to realize that it was Nick and Meg having one of their 'sotto voce' discussions arguments. (I couldn't tell the difference.) Finally, the denouement seemed somehow unrelated to the rest of the plot (such as it was); I came away with the impression that perhaps there was more to Nick and Meg's relationship than had been previously disclosed. Altogether, this was a most unsatisfactory film.",1429142400,2,1503,4.449275362318841

Wrecking a hotel room, what, as therapy?  She seemed to be having a stroke at times when she wouldn't respond and then would take off running.  It was just weird.  Maybe I missed some meaning, and I get that they were both looking for things that had passed away and navigating their future in a long marriage with its many problems, but the way this came out was just tiresome.",1428969600,,517,4.637362637362638
6355592,3,B00JEEZT68,"This movie was a little strange, but good. I felt sorry for the couple most of the picture, but I enjoyed seeing them have fun and enjoy themselves. Jeff Goldberg (I think that's his name) added a little life to the picture for sure. It may depress you a little in the beginning, but it gets more and more interesting as the picture goes on. Just don't look for anything too interesting. I gave it three stars because it wasn't all bad, but it wasn't great either.",1428710400,,464,4.344827586206897
6355593,3,B00JEEZT68,"This reminded me of a Bergman film, it was depressingly realistic and the human condition is not always inspiring. Films like this make me never want to marry, if this is what's in store. So much for the gentle golden years, aging takes raw courage.

The film depicts a British couple celebrating their 30 yr anniversary in Paris. What could have been a fun filled trip with great food, sights and nostalgia was instead an outlet for long held resentments and a lifetime of disappointments. When you know someone very well you collect a lot of ammunition that can be used against the other person and this couple didn't hesitate to use it either. The wife was particularly nasty and came off as cold, aloof and unlikable. The husband came off somewhat better with his easy attitude though it was sad to see him constantly running around trying to placate this unappreciative and moody woman.

Spoilers. The couple unexpectedly meet up with a former American friend of the husband in Paris and later attend a dinner party at his house. This friend had ditched his first American wife, moved to Paris and then married a twenty-something Russian girl who is now pregnant. While explaining his new home situation to his shocked British friend he said, ""Don't we all want to be loved, wanted, looked up to, needed, adored and chased around even as we age?"" That quip made me think about the cruelty of aging; becoming invisible and experiencing one's social value decline even though the mind is chock full of information, wisdom and life experiences. It made me better understand the depression and unhappiness many older people endure.

The American friend's teen son deals with his dad's new life very matter of factly as teens often do at that age. His interactions with the British husband provided an honest piece of humanity in the film.

It was beautifully filmed, though most of the drama took place indoors, it would have been nice to have seen more of Paris!",1428537600,,1964,4.784660766961652

There are plenty of lovely apartments for a very reasonable price.  I know it's probably irrelevant, but I just feel obligated to mention this.  I'm not sure Paris had anything to do with influencing their feelings.  I might watch it again on my computer with Closed Captioning because I watched it on my TV without captioning and didn't understand everything being said because of the British accents.

The 60+ year olds were acting like 14 year old juveniles destroying property and not paying their bills. I get needing to tweak one's life once the kids are gone but running off to Paris and not finding romance and having to listen to the protagonists bicker and complain was a waste of  time.

6355675,2,B00JEEZT68,"I like films where the action is all in the dialogue, and the fun is all in the getting there.  The ""Before Sunrise"" trio exemplifies this best, the first two more than the most recent film though...  I also like relationship films where the relationship is off key, or simply deranged, and this movie reminds me of a repressed version of two of those:  ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe""  where shakespearean Richard Burton, and Hollywood Goddess Elizabeth Taylor, both married and divorced (and re-married and re-divorced) in real life take the audience into what seems like the two of them having one of their real life brawls in a thinly disquised movie about a horribly discontented middle aged couple.  Wow.  And ""Harold and Maude"" where a boy who feels stifled by his normal, affluent life, acts out, until he meets an idiosyncratic old woman who understands him, and takes him under her wing (and into her bed).

""Le Weekend"" is not one of those movies.

What it is, if you turned off the volume, and perhaps dubbed in a soundtrack, is a fantastic film tour of Paris---not the stock shots you see in most other films, but shots of streets and avenues and neighborhoods the wandering visitor encounters, full of awe, always looking up and down and trying to see everything there is to see.  Unfortunately (and the reason turning off the soundtrack would sound like a good idea) the view is marred by this terrible, middle aged, British couple who have come to Paris because fighting at home has gotten boring.

The wife, Meg (played all too well by Lindsay Duncan) seems to have an undiagnosed mental disorder (ADHD?) as she definitely runs hot and cold, and in the blink of an eye.  One moment she's frivolous to the point of childish, and the next (often seemingly spurred by the degree to which her husband, who clearly loves her, has been drawn in to her fantasy) she's morose, expressed most of the time by mindlessly vicious verbal attacks on her husband.  The husband, Nick (the rather demented looking, bug eyed Jim Broadbent) asks for it, by losing all respect in his willingness to allow himself to be drawn into her web, when he should know damn well it's only going to end badly.  He's more desperately in love than loving;  and she's somewhere between a sadistic Parisian courtesan of the Sun Kings, and a preying mantis.

There are scenes that stand out in my memory, brilliant scenes.  One, where he's got his iphone ear pods in, listening to some sixties band he grew up on, bopping about---from one angle he looks almost young again, in profile he's clearly a hideously aged buffoon.  Another scene, where she's dressing for dinner, that they'll attend at the house of a friend (in the Rue de Rivoli, no less) she's slinking about the bedroom in opaque black stockings and black velvet heels that have an almost lethal attraction----Nick sits on the couch practically slobbering at the sight, when she sees him and decides to play with him, like a black widow going out on her web for the fly...  she tells him to get down, and he crawls off the couch, onto his knees, begging her---the very object of her loathing and understandably so---and just as she has him, she crushes him.  The coldness of her eyes, the look on her face...

But the parts do not add up.  In ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolfe"" the intensity builds, relenting only to gain energy to build  to new heights;  the protagonists try to enlist the sympathy and support of their guests against the other spouse, and once they feel so armed, off they go again.  It's a rotting married life as breathless spectacle.  Here the rot is more internal, cancerous, and no one feels free enough to scream in the pain they clearly feel, thus the audience is never quite drawn in.  That and the fact that this is an aging baby boom couple, raised in plenty, free from want, indulged to a fault.  They never really grew up, and they're still as selfish as they were as children.  And delusional.  Clearly, while Nick is in love with his wife, he's also too willing to suspend reality when she takes over, and tends to draw him into her deceitful world.  It may be played to seem idiosyncratic, but the woman clearly has a failing moral compass, between her own delusional affair with a younger man, and her inability to accept that they can't afford to do some of the stuff she wants to do.  It's one thing when they enter a very expensive restaurant and order to their heart's content, and then---after having chosen that moment of their anniversary to tell her husband she'd like to talk about leaving him; and he responds (later) that she should buy him one last dinner (this one), she realizes she can't afford it and she decides they'll skip out.  But, unfortunately (for the film's credulity) that becomes her default solution, when the money begins to run out.  Steal.  Eventually, between the cost of what seems to be the Presidential Suite and the charges they incur there, they find they can't check out as they can't pay the bill;  they can't leave France, because the hotel has their passports; and they get caught trying to skip out.

I can't say that I liked Burton and Taylor as characters in their cinematic brawl, but they took the audience for an A-Ticket ride (google that, child).  This couple does not take the audience much of anywhere, on any sort of ride.  They're both pathetic, selfish and delusional to a fault, and watching them is neither a pleasure nor entertaining.  If it weren't for the Paris backdrop, I wouldn't have stuck with it for as long as I did, but even Paris could not, and did not, save this film.",1418515200,,5617,4.641051567239636

6355677,2,B00JEEZT68,"A depressing snapshot of a couple eating the fruits of 30 years of bad decisions. My take on the movie is that it's a tame version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff?.  We meet them bickering their way through the trip from Birmingham to Paris: he planned this trip as a last-ditch attempt to save their marriage, but she makes it clear she's simply humoring him. Through the next 90 minutes, we learn that he adores her and will do anything for her, but she is exquisitely and exclusively attuned to her own misery and is intent on leaving him. We learn with her that he lost his job months ago, but couldn't find a way to tell her. She then decides to quit her job so she can learn to tango. Their son is living a failed life. They eat expensive meals and then giggle through escapes to avoid paying.  She refused to stay in the modest hotel room he had reserved for them. We see by the end that they ran up a bill they can never pay by staying in a Presidential Suite, fail in their attempt to escape it and are faced with  bankruptcy and the loss of their passports.  The movie leaves them choosing a tune in a juke box in a Paris Bistro, then getting up and doing a soft-shoe shuffle to it, along with an old friend they hope will bail them out - a grace they would not extend to their own son.  No violence, no car chases, no gratuitous sex - just depressing self-absorption. View at your own risk.",1418342400,6,1403,4.220149253731344

6355716,4,B00JEEZT68,"Maybe I should have given it 5 stars, maybe at least a 4 1/2 stars....

A couple that has become disenchanted with each other...or more correctly the wife was cold towards her husband and that made him unhappy. She was unhappy with him, because their son in his middle ages was still mooching on them, and using them...and she wanted at last to have some life to call their own. So they head off to Paris for a weekend...with him grudging each penny...and her ready to spend their life savings. So...all of this causes a lot of tension and it is more about a REAL couple in this situation struggling to find out how to have fun....and if they can do that, how to find fun together and find some of their appreciation for each other again.

So even though this film is funny at time, it is also tense and painful at time. It isn't the scenery that you appreciate, it is the fine acting from the two stars that makes this film so real...and so uncomfortable. BUT if you stick with it, my husband didn't, he said it depressed him...you see them seeing each other again...learning each other again...respecting each other again.  And since humans learn by monkey see, monkey do...this could be a very good beginning for many couples who have let the daily-ness of life make them feel sad about their marriages.

At the very end, the climax comes. I found that it made the whole film make sense.

There is a little sexual content that I found uncomfortable...pretty uncomfortable...but...for once it was part of the story that went along with each couples personality (a person has a personality, and when in a couple, that couple has a personality also) that made the story seem even more real.",1417305600,,1690,4.582781456953643

6355821,3,B00JEEZT68,"The film was well-acted, well-scripted, and the cinematography was good as well. It is a great way to tour Paris in an armchair. But the characters were not ones I would spend a weekend with! (Jeff Goldblum notwithstanding!) The verbal sniping gets so cruel and constant it becomes distasteful. How on earth did these people stay married for 30 years?

Unfortunately, the film portrays the usual clichs about ""getting old"" -- not being able to deal with changing sexuality, changing employment, and the ""What did it all mean?"" question. But the way these boomers deal with them gives boomers a bad name.

The couple tries all the standard ways to recapture their lost youth-- funky music, spontaneous physical intimacy, madcap splurges. All of which fall predictably flat and just make them more unhappy.

Instead of trying to solve these problems constructively at any point in this movie, they just ""act out""--  they blame the partner, they ""stiff"" restaurants and hotels out of their bills because they want what they can't afford, and they mooch off their friends to bail them out of their extravagance.  But these are adults! Haven't they learned anything in their advanced age of sixty-something?

Lucky for them Jeff G's character is rolling in euros and so emotionally needy himself that he helps them out of nostalgic gratitude!

So if you want a vicarious weekend in Paris with some folks who need serious couples counseling, this movie is for you. At least it won't cost you anything but your time.

6355822,4,B00JEEZT68,"Usually when movies use Paris as a romantic backdrop, its a young couple who gets to occupy the foreground. Not so with Le Week-End, a tale of two aging tourists - he a professor of philosophy, she a teacher - whove chosen to celebrate their 30th anniversary in (where else? ) the City of Lights.

Like many couples who have been together for a long time, Nick and Meg Burroughs often seem to have more things that are driving them apart than bringing them together. Not only have they grown tired of each others all-too-predictable habits and quirks, but Meg, in particular, feels that now, with the kids grown and gone, it may be time for the two of them to move on and to spend what little time they have left getting to know themselves as individuals rather than as a couple.

Because the screenplay by Hanif Kureishi is clearly focused on an older couple, the film captures the paradox that exists at the core of lasting romantic love: that the very same predictable patterns and dull routines that, over time, work to deaden love are also what enhance intimacy and bind us inexorably to one another over the long haul.

Though Meg and Nick are still clearly sexual beings, even that fact has caused some tension and division between them, namely in an affair Nick had awhile back and for which he is perpetually atoning. Yet, the script is smart enough to know that what is said in the heat of the moment is not always indicative of what is in the heart.

Much of the second half of the film takes place at a posh and pretentious dinner party thrown by an old college buddy of Nicks, an American author and intellectual played by Jeff Goldblum.

Director Roger Michell keeps the tone serious and intimate without becoming heavy-handed or preachy. He allows the characters to reveal their depth through conversation and the way they interact with the world and each other. He is aided immeasurably by the skilled and incisive performances of Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan, who make us truly believe that they are a couple who have grown both comfortable and complacent with one another over time. Above all, Le Week-End acknowledges that relationships are tricky and complex things and come with no pat or easy instructions to make them easier to navigate our way through.

After Le Week-End, it may not be necessary for Richard Linklater to make another Before movie, after all. I think Kureishi and Michell might have done it already.",1411862400,3,2444,4.685314685314685
6355823,5,B00JEEZT68,"Old age isn't fashionable. There are few if any opportunities for ""overcoming adversity"" or even for some CGI. On Golden Pond was a rare success in this genre; the rest are usually stupid movies like Grumpy Old Men that have nothing to say, and say it tritely.

Le Week-End is completely different. I've never seen a film that so deftly and subtly examines the results of spending half a lifetime with another person in a matrimonial relationship. There are disappointments, betrayals large and tiny, the irritation at old annoying habits, and also, astonishingly, moments of hope and tenderness. This is a very real movie, not a banal ""character arc in seven scenes"" movie-by-numbers. It is uncomfortable, moving, and painful to watch at times. Although there are moments of humor this is a comedy only in the Shakespearean sense that it's not a drama or a tragedy. So if you're looking for something for date night or to lighten the mood after a hard day at work this is not something you should choose. But if you want a serious and truly moving exploration of the frailties and foibles of a married couple who like us all have their ups, downs and sideways moments and somehow still find it better (just) to remain together than to part, this is a brilliant little gem of a movie with outstanding performances all around. Even the camera work is perfect - not seduced by Paris but rather showing us Paris through the eyes of the couple, warts and all. And the direction is likewise deft. The moment where Broadbent's character is standing by an ATM and sees a beautiful young woman dismount from the pillion of a motorcycle, remove her helmet and shake her hair, is understated and yet speaks volumes about the way youthful feelings become trapped inside old bodies in a way that is helpless yet profoundly moving - and this is all done in about three seconds of screen time.

If you like real movies about real people you should absolutely make time for this film - it's a minor masterpiece, like a Vermeer painting, that reveals more and more the closer attention you pay to it.",1411430400,22,2084,4.691256830601093

6355825,4,B00JEEZT68,"A train, where we observe people, and finally to an older couple, the woman reading, the man acting anxious, touching his pockets to make sure the Euros and their travel plans are all set. Our introduction to Lindsay Duncan as Meg Burrows and Jim Broadbent as Nick Burrows. They are on their way to Paris for an anniversary weekend.

We find out soon enough that in this 30 year marriage, all is not well. They end up at an hotel where they once stayed 30 years ago, and Meg refuses to stay. Off they go in a taxi looking at the sights of Paris and end up in a very expensive hotel suite. This is a weekend to rev up their marriage, and it sounds like they need something. Nick mentions that Meg has not been available for love making for 5-10 years. Meg is cruel and downright nasty to him. They do have some fun, but it is not until an old college friend of Nick's runs into them. Morgan played by Jeff Goldblum is a well to do artist living with his new, pregnant wife. He invites them for dinner.

Now, things go downhill and then uphill again. Nick and Meg have things to say, and they do. This is a fine film of an older marriage, and the actors are superb. Usually Jim Broadbent plays a feeble older man. In this film he is in fine form, a welcome nuance. Lindsay Duncan is a joy. I have watched her in the new TV series, 'The Honorable Woman', a small part, but she is recognizable and unforgettable. Jeff Goldblum is perfect in this part. All in all, a film many married when revel in.

He runs after her and this dysfunctional couple go downhill from this point on, including her checking into a suite in a top rated hotel they clearly cannot afford.  He just tags along helplessly.

Clearly whomever directed this has a dismal view of life over 60.  And although the story kept our interest, I wanted to step in and get these two to really talk.

6355839,5,B00JEEZT68,"Brilliant movie, very entertaining, very feel-good.

I don't think I have to give details about the plot; lots of others have done it. Just a couple of points.

To me it seems a remake of the classic Its a Wonderful Life by Frank Capra. Everything is here: the despair of the central hero; his death wish; the deus-ex-machina (not as angel but very angelic); the angel saves the day. And thats just for starts.  There is also a funny reversal: Clarence, the Its a Wonderful Life, was played by a British actor and he saves the all-American James Steward; here the angel is Morgan, an American who saves a Brit.

Why adolescent? It uses all the tropes and language of an adolescent; the expressions that would make ones mother frown. Funnily enough this is also very realistic as I fully identified with that: thats how my (and theirs) generation talks and acts. A left-over from the 60s and 70s. I wonder, how did James Steward talk to his wife in reality?",1408320000,,956,4.573099415204679

6355842,5,B00JEEZT68,"Le Weekend is very satisfying in that it is devoid of cliches and predictable moments and turns of story and relationship.  Each and every actor in the film is virtuosic.  Jim Broadbent surprises because while he usually appears old and physically weak in some films, here he becomes a virile, sexual object, partly because of his real energy and partly because any man playing opposite Lindsay Duncan is going to appear more vigorous and sensuous because you'd have to be - to be worth her affections. She simply makes all her male film partners look good.  Lindsay Duncan is a bright light in anything she appears in.  Although she has put on a few years since I first fell in love with her, she maintains an irresistible beauty and personality you want to run off with - to anywhere.  The writing is solid and truthful in showing us not just an aging husband and wife disintegrating into constant friction, but a living breathing couple who can be really irritated with each other in one moment, find belly-laugh humor together in the next moment, and then even arouse their animal lust for each other.  Jeff Goldblum's character is unpredictable and sparkling, and he shows us his always remarkable acting talent and his very appealing spirit.  There is consistently really good directing that makes it all work so well.  And then at last, there is the mad love affair with Paris that this unique city evokes in us.  Paris is shown in the same way I and others - and perhaps you - have always felt about everyday-Paris and every street and building and cafe and restaurant and hotel room.  It's shown in this film and in every scene. It's a combination of Paris being Paris  - and a director and cinematographer seeing and capturing it.  The ending is the stuff of good meals, good wine, and joyous life.  The final little dance will stay in my heart forever.  I've told you too much.  But you must experience this lovely film for yourself.",1407628800,,1944,4.659824046920821

Since Moulin Rouge! I have found Jim Broadbent to be a fantastically odd actor. And while I will admit I haven't seen every last film he has been in since his role as Harold Zidler, it seems every time I saw him he was some eccentric character who easily became one of the films highlights. So upon seeing his name attached to a drama film, I thought perhaps I should give him a chance in a role in which he is trying to play someone serious, and Im quite glad I did.

Characters & Story

To celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary, Nick (Jim Broadbent) and Meg (Lindsay Duncan) head to Paris, the city of love. A place where we learn how absent love maybe in their relationship. For as much as you can see Nick loves Meg, and wants to be intimate with her, it seems Meg isn't as in love with Nick as she perhaps once was. She criticizes him harshly, while giving him a only a slight tease of sweetness, and as the movie goes on you can see the mans self-esteem has likely been beaten to its foundation since, at the end of the day, Meg just isn't happy. But, the question remains: will their marital problems of the present mean their 30th anniversary will be their last, or will they work things out and hopefully make it to their 31st?

Praise

I must admit my praise does come with me having to rethink it as I go along, if just because as much as I love the dynamic between Duncan and Broadbent, watching them does become depressing at times. If just because Duncans portrayal of Meg is just so vicious that you feel sorry for poor Nick within 10 minutes. For not only is Meg hard to please, but seemingly on the verge of a mid-life crisis and stuck with this man who seems to be game with her new life changes, but only because the idea of being alone terrifies him. And often their relationship seems as uncomfortable for them as it is for you. Perhaps leading you to wonder why this isn't part of the critique? Well, Im praising it because their relationship is so complicated that you can tell these two have been together for 30 years. You can visibly see Nick has become comfortable with her demeaning him, teasing him, and perhaps never becoming fully satisfied with who he is. Then, on the other end of things, you can see that Meg sort of likes how Nick still sticks in there with her, and repeatedly makes her feel desirable and wanted. So just as much as the two can make you feel depressed by the concept of being with someone 30 years and it becoming like their relationship, at the same time it shows this complexity which allows you to understand how no matter what Meg may say to Nick, and what he may have done in the past, or says in the present, there remains this sense of love between the two buried underneath it all.

Criticism

But, even with that said, truly until you reach almost near the end of the film when Morgan (Jeff Goldblum) comes about, this film can be slightly unbearable. For while you understand in the end how Meg and Nicks relationship works, until then it is really hard to see this old man damn near beg his wife for the affection she seems unwilling to give. And then when it comes to the insults she flings at Nick! Oh, none of them are good natured, I mean what I say, but Im going to say it in a nice way so your feelings don't get hurt. No, Meg says the type of things of which Im sure if Nick was younger, and thought more highly of himself, he would probably seek a divorce for Meg is emotionally abusive. And honestly I found what she said so bad that I felt a trigger warning was needed in case someone had an emotionally abusive partner in the past.

Overall: TV Viewing

While this is a good movie with excellent performances, Meg makes it hard to say this is Worth Seeing. If just because she is the type of character who triggers either pent up anger for Nick not really fighting back, or some sense of depression for you can see Nick is beaten and bruised, but has no one else to turn to when it comes to buttering him up. And while Morgan does this to a point, he isn't Nicks wife. But perhaps the main reason Im marking this as TV Viewing is because it really does take a while to get into the story and get past Megs abuse and understand the relationship dynamic.",1405209600,,4264,4.300124533001245
6355872,5,B00JEEZT68,"Excellent performances all-around. Paris might be added to the cast, as it is portrayed in a subtler way than the more usual tourist destination. I was disappointed that the film skewers philosophers (in the person of the starring husband, Broadbent)  a cheap shot, in my view  as it is difficult to believe that someone who has spent a career in that profession would commit the several crimes attributed to this man, against businesses. But then, the movie is about coming to terms with failure and dysfunction, in life and in love.",1405209600,,534,4.857142857142857
6355873,4,B00JEEZT68,Very artsy and delightful.  It's always a pleasure to watch Jim Broadbent play deep characters.,1404950400,,95,5.333333333333333
6355874,4,B00JEEZT68,"Excellent Film. Although uneven at times, it gives a realistic picture of a middle-age marriage, with all the hopes and disappointments that are still there. Despite the aging skin, they are all (including the Jeff Goldblum character) still wanting to be loved, like the teenagers that they are inside. The difference between Jeff Goldblum's character and that of the married couple is that the married couple sees beyond the momentary glitter of a younger wife (or in the case of Lindsay Duncan's character, a younger male lover). Life, a long-term marriage, getting older, getting sacked for being politically incorrect, and the like are hard, but it is those who weather it together, despite whatever warts and disappointments that they may have, who win in the end. So let us all dance, for the dance is the thing, in the end. It's imperfect, but you might as well enjoy that dance while you are here (or there in Paris, as the case may be).",1404864000,17,945,4.803680981595092
6355875,5,B00JEEZT68,"Broadbent, Duncan and Goldblum all do terrific turns in this bracing comedy about growing old and looking back. Great dialogue by the brilliant Hanif Kureishi (My Beautiful Launderette, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, Buddha of Suburbia). Michell and Kureishi have worked together before to great effect and I'd urge you to see Venus with Peter O'Toole, also their Buddha of Suburbia. Wonderful jazz soundtrack, and Paris has never looked more ethereal. Excellent film. Highly recommended.",1404864000,6,483,5.453333333333333
6355876,5,B00JEEZT68,"When I saw the trailers for Le Week-End, it appeared to be an affectionate and playful romp in Paris between a middle-aged husband and wife celebrating their anniversary. Scenes like skipping out of an expensive restaurant without paying the bill and meeting an old friend named Morgan (played by Jeff Goldblum) where fairly light hearted. The film is actually a more serious examination of a 30 year old marriage. Nick (Jim Broadbent) and Meg (Lindsay Duncan) are a modest, slightly frumpy couple. Nick remarks in the film that you cant love and hate the same person but ha and Lindsay are in a world inhabited by disappointment and the drudgery of living together (we learn that Meg has had an affair in the past). They have two sons who prey upon the good nature of Nick whenever they want money.

(spoilers)

The trip to Paris is meant to awaken the passions of the past but from the start there are disappointments. The Montmartre hotel where they spent their honeymoon has turned into a non-descript and slightly seedy.  Meg checks them into a far grander hotel near the Seine with views of the Eiffel Tower. Nick and Meg set out to visit Paris but there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction.  When Nick tries to get affectionate with Meg, she rebuffs him, forcing him on his knees. Meg complains about Nicks need for stability and appears that she would rather free herself from him permanently.

The climax of the film comes when they are invited to the Rue d Rivoli apartment of Morgan, who was at college with Nick and looks up to him as a mentor.  Morgan has divorced his wife, married a young and dotting woman who is pregnant and has a book coming out. He appears to be the epitome of success. That is, until Nick has talk with Morgans young son from his first marriage. He learns that Morgan is terrible at communication and that his new marriage is happy at the moment but who can say when his new wife will wake up to discover that Morgan is a bore. Meg has met a man at the party and they are attracted to each other and she arranges to meet him after dinner. She confession what she is doing to Nick and during dinner, following a warm introduction from Morgan, Nick stands up and confesses to all of his shortcomings and makes a distinction that sex is not love. He reveals what Meg is up to and says that he has loved her for more than 30 years and always will.  The confession brings Meg around but then they are thrown out of their hotel for exceeding their credit card limit. Nick and Meg slip past the hotel staff and flee to the nearest caf.  There they are met by Morgan, whom they have phoned, and he offers to help them. The film ends on this high note.

(end spoilers)

What makes Le Week-End special is the chemistry between Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan. Both are teachers and have spent a good deal of their lives catering to their children (one of their sons is living in the basement). Their son keeps calling them, and Nick as a dutiful parent keeps answering the phone while Meg fumes.  The new future for Meg and Nick comes at the end of the film when Nick turns the phone off when his son calls. Le Week-End is an interesting melodrama about love, marriage and the difficulties of living with another person. This is a movie that will appeal to baby boomers most of all, and especially if one has had a long marriage. In the end, Meg and Nick has come a long way and still have a long way to go.",1399852800,10,3437,4.4224683544303796
