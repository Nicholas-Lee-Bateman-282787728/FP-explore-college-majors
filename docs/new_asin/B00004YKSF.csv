7927311,5,B00004YKSF,"Generator Gawl is one of the finest animes I've ever seen.  It's not overdone, like the way some other series seem to be (or try to be, in some cases).  The comedy is hilarious, the action is outstanding, the plot is rewarding, the animation is spectacular, and they all balance exceptionally well.  This series (and this disk in particular) are a must-have for any hardcore anime freak like myself.",1012521600,,399,4.753623188405797
7927312,4,B00004YKSF,"Not bad at all! In fact, quite good. Volume 2 continues the tendency of volume 1 to reveal the details of the plot gradually, unlike many anime series, which reveal the plot at the beginning of the series, and rely on fight scenes to carry the rest of the story.  This volume reveals further details on the pasts of Ro, Gawl, and Koji, and their connections to each other. It's revealed that Ro and Koji had a part in making Gawl a generator, though the only fact revealed in any great detail, is Ro's guilt for his participation.
Overall, the story is good, the mystery in it is wonderful, and the action and comedy elements are well done.  It's worth watching!",980899200,,662,4.462809917355372
7927313,5,B00004YKSF,O.K. I really enjoyed this segment of the series because it was more comical than the first segment of the series but still had a great plot and good action scenes mixed in. The plot doesn't move in the same direction but it keeps moving which a lot of similar animes don't do such as tenchi. The whole segment is very well done but so as not to give away anything about the segment I will just tell you this is a must buy.,980208000,,423,4.0476190476190474
