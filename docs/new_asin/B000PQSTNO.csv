8192990,5,B000PQSTNO,"This is an extraordinarily poetic film. It is the saga of one man and two boys stranded together in a besieged town. Their relationship, forced at first, develops to the point that the man, a poet himself who has stayed behind once his wife and daughter have left, has imaginary or magical meetings with wife and daughter who advice him what to do in several occasions, and meets his death to protect these boys. Moving, excellent performances, great photography.",1326067200,,463,4.8734177215189876
