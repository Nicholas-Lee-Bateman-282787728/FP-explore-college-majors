2785925,5,B000NVT0UM,"I only heard about Dante's Cove, by accident on Myspace, when Amazon suggested I might be interested, I thought ok, why not, I can't comment on season one just yet as disc one of the two is faulty, so on to season two, yes the cast is beautiful in a West Hollywood boy/girl next door sense of the word, they are beautifully filmed, over act at every turn, not a bad thing in this series, which is poorly written, but facinatingly so, it's hard to stop watching once you start the disc, which is breathtakingly mastered, it's not HiDef. but damned close, you can see the peach fuzz on Kevins skin over all his body, there is great dimension and detail in the images, the special effects aren't bad, Thea Gill, brings a very believable performance to this saga, a nice touch, that helps a lot, I don't see where the explicit sex scenes are so explicit, you never see the main characters showing full frontal nudity, nor are the actions graphic, this is R rated stuff, not XXX, and not much more than PG, except for the sex shop, which seems to be a cover for Drugs, and ?, I think we will find out in the third season, it's not quite camp, but close, perhaps in the third season we will see better scripting and acting instead of making faces, having said all that, it's very much worth having, chances are you will, as I am doing, view it over and over, and tell yourself, this is SO BAD, IT'S GOOD.",1181865600,3,1398,4.319391634980988
2785926,5,B000NVT0UM,"One can't approach Dante's Cove as a piece of high art, but rather as the guiltiest of pleasures.  Happily, the second season improves upon the first.  Tracy Scoggins still vamps it up with gusto, Nadine Heimann remains a cute pixie, Gregory Michael gives hang-dog looks, and Charlie David give it the old junior college try.  But the production feels sharper, the writing a bit tighter, and the cast changes a mostly welcome improvement.  Bonus points for Queer as Folk actress Thea Gill, who maintains her dignity and elevates the material far more than it probably deserves.

Still, it's a fun afternoon of a trashy, campy gay soap.",1181692800,4,635,4.897196261682243
2785927,5,B000NVT0UM,"When i was first told about the show, i had my doubts. Finally i gave in and bought season one just based on my friends reviews and others positive reviews. I was not disappointed. Despite the bits of cheesy acting in the beginning and the campiness, the show is REALLY REALLY good. It is DEFINATLY unlike anything you have ever seen. While it does pay an omage to other shows, blending Melrose Place/Dark Shadows and Queer as Folk, it is a great supernatural gay drama that is uniquely it's own. After watching season one, i was hooked and got my cable provider to hook me to Heretv. Now after seeing season two, im anxiously awaiting the third season. Season two is just as great as season one. I highly recommend this show, after one episode YOU WILL BE HOOKED!!",1175126400,35,765,4.510791366906475

2785983,4,B000NVT0UM,Okay.  We open up and its a brand new building for the Dante's Inn.  All nice and bright with no spooky quality about it.  More witches and more hottness with it which of course brings more drama.  Even a gay guy with all the money and powers of witch craft still isn't happy.  Sad.. but its a loyalty to the gay community that we watch and support these shows and movies and as long as I have a breath in my body I will do that.  Hoping that season three ties everything up nicely.,1368748800,,482,4.074468085106383

2786005,5,B000NVT0UM,"Arrived the day they said it would and at what I think is a great price. At a friend's advice, I had watched the first [short] season on Netflix, but that's all they had. I hadn't even heard of it before, but I don't watch much TV either due to the sorry programming with all these ""reality"" shows. I got so into the show that I had no choice but to buy this and will probably buy the 3rd season also if I can't find it online. I wish there were quality TV on these days like this. It's great to see a show with [hot] gay folks that is full of suspense, intrigue and some serious passion. The main characters reflect better how most gay guys really are than some shows I've seen in the past that overlook masculinity and responsibility to each other.",1349654400,,750,4.179310344827586
2786006,1,B000NVT0UM,this is sooooooo bad i cant even try to explain lol if it wasn't for the nice beaches and some nice guys to look at plus the fact that i got this for only 3.00 i would b upset. where do they find these 'actors'? a few seem like they might b able to act but the script and sudden i'm mad now i'm not' acting is pathetic lol i honestly cant see any of these ppl putting this down on a resume and think they would b taken seriously! this has about 1 one 100th of the class that Queer As Folk had. unless someone gives this to you for free and you have nothing at all better to do watch it for a laugh with some friends maybe but for no reason but it at retail lol,1347667200,,660,3.7553956834532376
2786007,1,B000NVT0UM,I wish the first season is closed-captioning. Why this second season is mostly read in English-subtitled. It didn't make any sense.,1345680000,,131,5.285714285714286
2786008,5,B000NVT0UM,"The series takes on a less darkened role than the first and changes out a couple of actors/actresses, that play certain characters, but for the better in my opinion. The show definitely finds its momentum in the making of the second season. Lot's of drama and excitement to keep you going.
I recommend this series to any adult.",1334275200,,327,4.655172413793103
2786009,5,B000NVT0UM,"I love this series!  This season showed a new Hotel Dante and a new Adam, which kind of annoyed me at first, by the end it actually made sense.
Lots more magic in this season and a lot more developing of the characters.  The level of drama was great.  The constant tension between Toby and Kevin was almost unbearable at times...
I recieved season three today and I can't wait to get going with it.  The way the second one ended was a cliff hanger!",1279756800,,448,4.235294117647059
2786010,5,B000NVT0UM,very good film  with a lot of drama and mystery and some good and bad endings...full of suspence,1259366400,,96,4.333333333333333
2786011,2,B000NVT0UM,"The second short season of Dante's Cove presents us with a better storyline and worse dialogues. Episodes have grown to five and the season is concluded by as high -and lame- a cliffhanger as that at the end of ""season"" one.
We have already been introduced to the characters and we find ourselves in the middle of action now, which is always fine with me. Problem is that the script sounds for a good 80% of the time completely idiotic. Short, disjointed sentences are conveying little meaning, no information about the character who speaks them who by the way generally sounds like a complete moron.

The setting has been changed too and, while the beaches are just as beautiful, the new hotel Dante is much less impressive than the old one even if it is much larger and allows more room for interaction.

Acting is just as plain as it was in season one with the possible exception of Thea Gill and Jon Fleming (this taking the role of Adam) who are up to the not much required by the script.

There are several glossy sex scenes, all of them homosexual, most of them involving the male characters. They add nothing to the thrill, to the storyline, to the overall tension and interest if not the pleasing view of the finely groomed bodies of Jon Fleming and some of the others.",1224547200,5,1278,4.523809523809524
2786012,5,B000NVT0UM,"I hadn't heard too much about this show when I got this DVD.  Suffice to say, I wasn't expecting much, but I liked it anyway.  The dialogue and special effects needed some punching up, but the copious eye candy made up for any deficiencies in the acting (in my opinion, anyway).  And why does each season of this series only do single-digit episode counts?  They need more material than that.  Anyway, I was thrilled to see that Tracy Scoggins has been keeping busy since her stint on Babylon 5, and I hope that this show lasts a while.  She seems like she's having a lot of fun playing Grace.  I know we haven't seen the last of this show, and that things can only get better from here.",1212624000,,687,4.3203125
2786013,5,B000NVT0UM,"Wow! The first sesason took off kinda slow. I think the writers didn't quite know where to take it, but the second season was amazing. A rareity to find such a fun frisy series that redifines witchcraft. Loved it! it was funny, scary, thrilling, mysterious, sexy, and enthralling all mixed into the second season. Cant wait for the 3rd season... and boy are the men sexy!!",1210550400,,372,4.651515151515151
2786014,4,B000NVT0UM,"Hey,

  This is a great show if you get past the bad actors. It has great pleasure scenes and has a good solid storyline, It also has a bit of fun in it with the supernatural side to it, and it has a bit of romance thrown in as well. This is very much a winding down guilty pleasure at bed time type show which to be honest have you ever even heard off. This is def worth the buy and its worth the price.",1207526400,,404,3.7294117647058824
2786015,4,B000NVT0UM,"Dantes Cove II continues the gay soap opera where Dantes Cove I left off. It probably does not matter that there is some sort of logic to the plot of this mystical saga of sex from the dark side. It seems like everyone is still hot for innocent Kevin, the beautiful blond boy who awakened a warlock from the past. Guys just can't seem to keep their hands off of Kevin's hot body (he fortunately never seems to find time to put on a shirt), much to the chagrin of his muscular boyfriend Tobey. That is the most reality based aspect of this whole melodrama. Gay culture never seems to change. That people keep coming back from the dead is another matter. This is a not a film for anyone devotged to the Stanislovsky method, as there seems to be no need for any acting talent. All of the focus is upon which gay match up can have the hotest sex. The lesbians don't get left out of this erotic enclave, which is nice to see that the two sides of male/female gay culture come together in one film. Not to give away the ending (as if the plot really mattered), but Kevin is in as much jeopardy from the dark forces at the end of the movie as at the beginng.",1205107200,,1151,4.1891891891891895
2786016,5,B000NVT0UM,"Well the witchs are at it again and this time they seem even more determined to tear apart our two hero's love in this beachside town.

Ambrosius can't help falling in love with Kevin who is in love with Toby and so the tawdry tale goes. Grace and Ambrosius are at odd's again but this time it's for the Solstice where one witch may travel back to anytime they choose to stop something from happening and of course change history. Of course this just isn't a fight between the two of them as a mysterious woman also enters into the mix by the name of Diana and she want's to play for her chance to change something in the past as well.

Who is Diana?, Will Toby lose Kevin to Ambrosius?, Will Grace get her revenge on Ambrosius?, Will something else totally un-expected happen in this beachside town where clothing seems almost optional at times. Grab your remote because you won't want to miss one moment of this DVD.

You also get a bonus because if you've heard of the DVD The Lair but haven't seen it, well this season of Dante's Cove get's you in behind the closed doors to the member's only club and the secrets they have behind them.",1201478400,,1140,4.367924528301887
2786017,5,B000NVT0UM,Normally the shows bore me and there is no point.  I watched The Lair Prior to both seasons of Dante's Cove...The Lair was so much like a kindergarten graduation play that they wanted to be a porno without showing too much...it was horribly!  Dante's Cove was INCREDIBLE!  There was plenty of eye candy for anyone and it was a remarkable storyline with great acting.  The gay men's voices were somewhat annoying but not as bad as in the Lair!  I recommend both seasons of Dante's Cove!!!,1193011200,,487,4.616279069767442

I was happy to hear of new, and respected cast members, however the story let them down.  The potential for a quality series is there below a surface of mistimed and meaningless sex.  It felt like watching a porno at times.

2786042,1,B000NVT0UM,"In Season One of Dante's Cove, I was willing to look past the horrendous scripts, a story thinner than cheesecloth, and actors that practically broke off chunks of scenery in their haste to chew on it for the sake of supporting here! TV.

No more!

After reading reviews that season two of the show featured better acting, scripts, and plot, I eagerly ordered my copy and can definitively say that it's just crap.

The actors may have better haircuts and the set is an improvement, it's so different from Season 1 that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief.

To make a long (and bad) story short, here's just a few things that are wrong with Dante's Cove:

- It's not a guilty pleasure.  So you're willing to overlook the lack of plot for nudity.  The only nudity you'll find is the same character in several episodes; I've seen the handyman's genitals so many times I can draw them from memory.  How come the main characters are unwilling to bare it all?

- It features the lamest ""witches"" ever.  There is supposedly so much power to be had, why do they need to drive cars?  Couldn't they just transport themselves from one place to another?

- The creators think the audience is stupid.  The only way these ""episodes"" reach normal television lengths is to continually show you flashbacks.  Flashbacks from last week, from last season, even things that happened only two scenes ago!  We're gay, not stupid.

I hope that someone will come up with a gay Supernatural or X-Files, a show with quality writing and acting.  This schlock gives all gay people a bad name!

Don't buy this, rent it and save yourself $[..]!",1185321600,10,1624,4.579861111111111
2786043,5,B000NVT0UM,"Having watched the first season, and being remotely impressed with the show, one wouldn't expect much greater in the second. I mean... the supernatural and gay/lesbian aspects are much fun and I loved the show but overall it wasn't exceptional. Seeing the previews for this season and noticing all the changes, I thought Season 2 would not be able to compare but it was definetly better than Season 1!! It has become more of a well-rounded show if that makes any sense. Some of the new characters are slightly annoying, and Bro has lost a lot of weight :( but overall Season 2 is amazing!",1184630400,2,588,4.609523809523809
2786044,5,B000NVT0UM,"In the second season of the guilty pleasure ""Dante's Cove"" (think of it as a cross between ""The O.C."" and the old series ""Dark Shadows"", but with gay erotic content that makes ""Queer As Folk"" look like an afterschool special), the hunky boys and beautiful girls who live at Dante's Hotel are living and loving, while still having to deal with the problems caused by its previous inhabitant, exiled warlock Ambrosius, and his ex-girlfriend and eternal nemesis, the witch Grace.

This season, they're joined by a mysterious, more powerful witch, Diana (played by Thea Gil, previously of QAF).  As we rejoin the gang, somewhat naive Kevin is tired of living under Toby's shadow, wants to get a job and become more self-sufficient, which makes Toby insecure about their relationship.  Seeing this as a chance to get Kevin back into his clutches, Ambrosius updates his image (""Call me 'Bro!"") and tries to dazzle the young man with a fast car and to-die-for beach house.  Toby's ex Adam (recast this year, for the better) gets involved with Ambrosius as well, and gets hooked on a local drug with supernatural origins.  Meanwhile, Van gets further into dabbling in magic, with a book she found on the beach, learns the truth about Ambrosius and Grace, and takes desperate measures when her girlfriend Michelle says she has to choose between the magic or their relationship.  The five (apx.) hour-long episodes also reveal a former boyfriend of Kevin's visiting the hotel, Adam's involvement with a gay afterhours sex club, the resort's handyman trying to seduce boss man Marco, more background on the two child ghosts that appear to Toby, as well as much more detail on the ins and outs of Grace's and Ambrosius' powers, and how they must ally themselves with a hotel guest in order to battle it out by the upcoming Solstice.  Comic relief is provided by the appearance of an old porcelin doll, which has a spell causing anyone who touches it to fall in instant lust with the next person (male or female) they see.

Critics say ""This is nothing more than a gay soap"" and point at the often over-the-top dialogue and occasional overacting.  Hey, it is what it is, and it works on that level exceedingly well, as most ""guilty pleasures"" should!  They definitely cranked up the ""camp"" quotient a notch or two this year, with Tracy Scoggins as Grace (trying to teach young protege' Van the nuances of black magic) losing her cool and occasionally seeming to be channeling Agnes Moorehead in ""Bewitched""!  The photography, music and eye candy is outstanding, and I found myself powerless to avoid going through all five episodes in one sitting.

Note that the format of this 2-DVD set can be a bit confusing, in that there is a top menu to choose the episode you want to see (which should obviously be viewed in order), and then a submenu to play that episode (No option to view all episodes on the disk consecutively.)  The second disk also includes some excellent extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with the cast, ""backlot"" featurette and ""coming out"" stories by the three openly-gay cast members.  It isn't Emmy-worthy, but a fun diversion for you and open-minded friends.  I'm under a spell not to give it anything less than a full five stars out of five.",1184457600,22,3259,4.815412186379929
2786065,1,B000NVT0UM,"I wish I knew how this series begins, but since disc one of Season One is
defective, I'm at a complete loss.  This is the reason I've given it the
lowest rating. Whenever I attempt to play the disc in question, a message
appears on screen stating that it ""...is a previously viewed disc."" The
question of who previously viewed it is beyond me, since I removed it from a
factory-sealed jewel case).  To make matters worse, whenever I attempt to
restart the disc at the beginning or from where it ""left off,"" it freezes
and refuses to resume playing.  Curiously, the other disc in the Season One

2786066,2,B000NVT0UM,"Too Bad there was a SEASON 2. Though, if you watched Season 1, Season 2 is worth it just to wrap up some loose ends and get some more sexy scenes.
Season 2 has changed locations, changed some characters, added some unnecessary characters and created a terrible DVD menu. The location change is the most egregious problem, besides just plain ol' bad acting. But who is watching the acting anyway. So, the location change completely changes the feel of Dante's Cove. It looks like someones house, up in Palos Verdes, rather than a seaside resort hotel in some old part of Key West. bugged me for the entire second season.
Hotties, hotties and more hotties. Like I said, it's not good, but if you watched Season 1, you need to get Season 2. Just because.",1184198400,4,751,4.57037037037037
2786067,4,B000NVT0UM,"Season One had quite a few hot Toby/Kevin scenes set to some great music -there was a lot of feeling, sensuousness and heat. Season 2 has almost none of that - and the sex club is boring. Still worth having, but a disappointment.

During the commentaries, the producer mentioned a great little take-off on the American Idol judges by the actors (Charlie D., Nadine H. and Gregory M.), and that he hoped he'd make it on the dvd as an outtake, but no outtakes, no bloopers are to be found on the disk! Maybe next time...",1184112000,,518,4.395833333333333
2786068,3,B000NVT0UM,the new male characters are not that hot or exciting as season one. it would have been better if the original cast members were still  performing.glad that there are more characters to add to the story.thea is a great addition to the cast.the plot is simple but enjoyable. the music is great and would like to see it on a cd.looking forward to season three. if anyone is interested in starting a fan club email me.  thanks,1183766400,2,422,4.467532467532467
2786069,4,B000NVT0UM,"In the second season of ""Dante's Cove"" the plot gets better but not enough to make the production much more than a gay soap. Some of the lines will make you groan out loud. My favorite is ""think of it (I don't remember what ""it"" was right now) as a vacation from your brain."" For some reason pretty Kevin gets a lot of the clunker lines. Apparently there isn't a clothing store near Dante's Cove since the men are shirtless (and shortless) a lot of the time. On the other hand, this show was never meant to be a rival for ""Brokeback Mountain.""

In season II new characters are added: Kai, Colin, Marco and Diana, the witch good sister of Grace. There is even more naked sex than in the first season; Van becomes a central character; and Toby, the moral center of the series, slips a little. The witches and warlock step up their fight, zapping in the twinkling of an eye those they consider the enemy. And the whole thing is shot in paradise.

There is nothing wrong with erotic fluff.",1183507200,7,985,4.377049180327869

2786072,5,B000NVT0UM,"The ultimate guilty pleasure returns for a second season--and I'm happy to report that it's better than ever.  I actually enjoyed this season a lot more than the first--more episodes, more interesting storylines, more full frontal male nudity (if you're into that sort of thing)! Okay, so the storyline really isn't why most people are watching this show--it's the hot naked bods--both men and women--that keeps us glued to the set.  Admit it, you know it's true.  A bare chest or backside is the normal everyday wardrobe for the inhabitants of Dante's Cove--and we wouldn't have it any other way.  However, without the witches and warlocks and doomed romances and tongue-in-cheek humor, the show would quickly get boring--even with all the sex and nudity.  And most of the beautiful people of the Cove can actually act and seem to be having a ball chewing up the scenery and spitting out the melodramatic dialogue.  Kudos must go to Tracy Scoggins (who I've loved ever since ""The Colbys""), William Gregory Lee (who now gets to be called ""Bro"" on the show--I prefer his full name Ambrosius), Nadine Heimann (who really shines in the second season) and newcomer Thea Gill (formerly of ""Queer as Folk"" and a welcome addition to the show)--they all give excellent performances in addition to looking gorgeous.  And I must mention that the DVD has some nice extra features--deleted scenes with the director's commentary (the director, Sam Irvin, and Charlie David--who plays Toby--also provide interesting commentary on a few of the episodes) and a few featurettes/interviews with the cast.  So if you enjoyed the first season of ""Dante's Cove"", you're going to absolutely LOVE the second season.  And I cannot to wait to return to the campy Cove for a third time!",1182902400,2,1760,4.979522184300341

2786074,4,B000NVT0UM,"This really is ""Melrose Place"" meets ""Dark Shadows"" meets ""Queer as Folk"".  It's an indie soap opera with an interesting plot.  The acting, well, it goes over-the-top in classic camp fashion, but it works.  I do agree with one prior reviewer, the sex and drug plot wasn't the greatest, hopefully it gets developed next season, but it did seem an easy way to get Adam out of the closet.  This isn't as raunchy as QAF, but it's also not as developed (hey, about 60 eps verus what, 7 hours tops so far?).  It's a fun show.  Certainly it's better queer fare than ""Adam and Steve"" or ""Eating Out"".",1182643200,,592,4.435185185185185
