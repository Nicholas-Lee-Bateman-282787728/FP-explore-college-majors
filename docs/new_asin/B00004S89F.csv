7921745,5,B00004S89F,"Which is why I like them. They reflect a great deal of the mindset of the Soviet Union and the utopian dreams of Communism. It is an interesting collection if you are interested in such things. I really enjoyed them and seeing how the mindset was so different, and not so different, in the United States and Europe at that time.",1402099200,,328,4.39344262295082
7921746,5,B00004S89F,this will definitely open you up to a whole new perspective on animation and russian civilization in the 1960s. fantastic purchase.,1266883200,,131,5.285714285714286
7921747,4,B00004S89F,All four volumes are excellent - they represent the best of soviet era animation. There is one glitch. As a Russian speaker I was quite disappointed with the fact that subtitles stay on the screen all the time and cannot be removed. It is rather annoying. If you are a Russian speaker - stay away from it.,1199577600,2,305,4.368421052631579
7921748,5,B00004S89F,"These animated shorts are classics to say the least.  They reveal so much about Russian culture that is universal to us all.  The variety of animation styles is astounding.  Stop motion, cut out, hand drawn, surrealism; it's all here.  The standout for me was ""Man in the Frame"", which is pure genius, showing literally how we frame ourselves with our capitalistic structures.  A must have for animation explorers.",1179100800,,414,5.029411764705882
7921749,1,B00004S89F,"This release did nothing at all for me. The storylines are weak and the art is dated and mediocre. These shorts strike me as the Soviet equivalent of those crufty, ephemeral 8mm films you find at flea markets and in the storerooms of elementary school libraries. Masterworks these are not.",1053648000,2,289,4.8
7921750,5,B00004S89F,"A great anthology of animated films from a country with a rich (yet often hidden) sense of humour. The films range from the Soviet system bashing of ""Man in the Frame"" & ""There Lived Kozyavin"" to  morality plays such as ""Ball of Wool"" and ""Glass  Harmonica"" to the delightful silliness of ""Film, Film, Film""  & ""The Passion of Spies"". These films provide a rare glimpse  into the REAL world of the Soviet Union of the sixties. A rich compilation  certain to please anyone who appreciates wit & wisdom in animation.",964915200,24,514,4.666666666666667
