7992150,5,B00009OY7X,"I recently purchased a copy of Cruising America's Waterways: The Mississippi River and truly enjoyed it.  The video is really beautiful.  Anyone who knows anything about the Mississippi, especially this stretch of it, realizes that the ""Big Muddy"" looks very much the same - primarily filled with barge traffic day and night - and that the ports along it are fascinating destinations for boaters and non-boaters alike.  I really liked the interview with the captain about navigating the Mississippi - good tips from someone who knows what he's doing.  I didn't know, until I watched this show, that Memphis had such a great museum devoted to the Mississippi River - I'm definitely visiting that!
I also enjoyed not only seeing the plantations and romance of the Mississippi River area portrayed, but also having the importance of the river conveyed, its importance to the cotton industry in the past (I never knew that we still had working cotton plantations dating back hundreds of years) and to the present, as was made clear in the visit to the Port of New Orleans in the program.
When I travel on my boat, I want to know what things there are to see and do along the way - and good places to eat.  This program showed me that and made me eager to get out and explore the Mississippi.  As a boater and a clergyman - I give this program on the Mississippi (and all the Cruising America's Waterways programs, some of which I've seen on PBS) my blessing!",1081382400,3,1454,4.66015625

It gets even worse with a visit to a bowling alley featuring rock music. My goodness, how much less interesting can you get.",1081036800,,264,4.408163265306122
