As a grow-up she live in a loft apartment, with the blinds closed and goes out only at night.  Meets a former class-mate, brings him home and boinking ensues.  Well, almost. HE says hes' not ready.  Bad guy gets out of prison, after calling and taunting the young woman. Woman and man go to his house in the town where they grew up. Bad guy follows. Classmate turns out to be a cop who wants to protect her. He has a wacky, druggy brother. Plot thickens, but we've been there before. There is a nice twist at the end, but it's been done before and better.  Actually everything in this movie has been done before and much better.  Acting, except for bad guy, is terrible. Continuity is awful. Her sculpture is nutty.  Don't waist time watching this.",1512345600,,899,4.385542168674699

7887796,5,6305262055,"PARANOIA focuses on a young woman who witnessed the senseless murder of her family by a demented madman named Calvin Hawkes.  Because she saw a brilliant light at the time, she is now afraid of the light, not the dark.  She has become an interior designer, pretty much a recluse in her darkened apartment, having psychiatric sessions with a doctor on her computer.  Into her life resurfaces a young man she grew up with, a hunky football player who admits he was interested in her, but felt she was unapproachable.  And now, the woman is receiving instant message conversations with the imprisoned Hakes, who is threatening her, and saying he will get her like he did her family.  She calls the prison and after some obstacles, discovers that Hawkes is getting out on probation.  This just begins the miasma of plot twists writer/director Larry Brand serves up.
I liked this movie because it's simple, not overly gory and melodramatic.  Brigitte Bako as the heroine is very convincing; Sally Kirkland does a nice cameo as the psychiatrist; Robert Floyd is a nice combination of machismo and sensitivity; and of course, Larry Drake is cool as the mad executioner.  It is by no means a flashy movie, and it's cool atmosphere makes it a haunting movie.",1080950400,3,1249,4.803738317757009
7887797,2,6305262055,"No, this is not the sleazy-awful-fun Carroll Baker 'Giallo' thriller from Italy with the same title (in Italy the title was ""Orgasmo"") released in 1968 that had a rich widow captive in her own mansion to her sexually menancing gardener and his bisexual girlfriend, listening to groovy Piero Umilani music while they wrapped her up in mind-and-sex games.  I guess if you've completely run out of grade B thrillers to watch, this 1998 release rates OK. Decent technical, but the storyline is tired, and it has been done better.",1013731200,,525,4.898876404494382
7887798,1,6305262055,"This film looks like an old slasher film from the 80s, but really it is lowbudget horror flick made only 2 years ago.  A stalker terrorizes a poor, innocent victim, but the poor, innocent victim decides to get him back for  killing her family.  This is an okay storyline, you might be saying, but it  is executed so poorly it isn't even close to scary (or interesting for that  matter).  Save yourself some time and do not view this movie.",960076800,3,439,4.425
