2864101,4,B000RDO27C,"I enjoyed the DVD, but it is set up like a dance class, not like an exercise video.  You gradually learn a choreographed routine.",1210550400,3,129,4.375
2864102,5,B000RDO27C,This dvd takes me back when I was in high school but also brings out my sex appeal and works out my whole entire body...............,1205712000,2,132,4.32
2864103,5,B000RDO27C,The instructions are slow which makes it easier to learn the dance moves.  The DVD also has a lot of routines to learn and a lot of practicing.  The music and the moves are great!,1204502400,3,179,4.085714285714285
2864104,5,B000RDO27C,"Excellent! She is great and makes the whole dancing thing so easy. I love the choreography and steps. It's different, challenging, fun and professional. I loved it!",1198972800,7,164,5.111111111111111
2864105,4,B000RDO27C,"I ventured into a diverse ambit of dance with this program, but I am never close minded about
learning and experimenting with dance.
Warm up is lengthy with yoga-like flow, plenty of lunging and stretching to get you limber. This is fast paced so it is a real warm-up.
There are also isolation exercises, chest, hip, head rolls, and body waves. I found them similar to belly dance isolations, more rigid and accented to complement the style.. I do feel the head rolls should be a little softer to prevent injury.
In the beginner section I have to admit I was somewhat frustrated.  The body is in full motion so get ready for hip bumps, and figure 8s, pivoting of the feet. The footwork is taught very fast paced but has lots of repetition. There is an array in moves, at times I felt the choreography transposes from aerobic to martial arts class .There are eleven lengthy combinations but the agility that I had stored up came through and though I am a few paces behind, I may catch up with plenty of repetition.
The second segment has8 combinations. This was fun and I found it more enjoyable than the beginner segment. I enjoyed the groove, funk, pivots, turns, elaborate arm and footwork, and full body undulations  and because I belly dance, isolation is not a problem. I placed most of my energy into this segment.  Combinations are lengthy and detailed, fast paced, but there is plenty of time to put them together, and again the routine repeats several times at the end.
The third segment has 8 combinations articulating arms, more body waves and staccato moves and traveling. Again, fast paced and more intricate arm and footwork. By now it appears the choreography becomes very challenging with these moves but not unrealistic to achieve.
At the end of each segment this energetic, and pleasant young lady takes you into her realm of dance with her great group as they perform each routine several times to draw you in. The music is catchy and makes it easy to venture into. Her humor and confidence stays with you as encouragement to finish out the program. Her moves are well defined, so it is not a maze to venture through the dance and visually easy to decipher the moves.  I do feel the choreography is designed for the young generation but a good challenge for those of us young at heart.
Upon completion of the program, you will discover in amazement, all things are possible! Though demanding, this program is  intricately put together and can be achieved with determination and will reward you with a dance in vogue.",1190505600,43,2535,4.674887892376682
2864106,5,B000RDO27C,"So this is the same Karen Gayle that did the set of Deante Dance dvds that I did not like, at all.  Here she is the real Karen Gayle, not a watered down version of herself.  I'm not really a hip hop person but the moves look funky, the music is good and the energy is high.  Here's what you can expect.

Setting: Sound stage with a curtain in the back.  4-5 dancers with Karen out front, all dressed in hip hop attire.

Music:  Hip hop instrumental.  Like I said I'm not a hip hop music fan, I just bought the dvd for variety in my exercise routine.

DVD Layout:  The entire running time on the dvd is 120 minutes.  It says on the world dance website that it is 60 minutes. The dvd has a 20 minute warm-up, starting with stretching, isolations from head to waist; foot work and rhythm work.  Good section.  Next you can choose from 3 routines, Beginning, Intermediate and advanced.  Each section has a learn the steps and performance sections. The beginners routine is repeated 2x at the end.  The intermediate rountine is repeated 3 times at the end and the advanced routine is repeated 4x.  At the  end of the dvd is a section called performance where it goes from one routine to the next.  There is no cool down.
The first routine is simple.  The second routine is a mix of smooth moves and hit it moves.  The third routine is like you would see on P. Diddy's Making the Band show, or on So you think you can dance on Fox.

I have not done the class yet so I don't know if learning the steps will be easy.  Hip hop is not really my thing so it will be interesting to see how much I pick up when I do it.  Karen is very patient and goes over the steps over and over again AND there is always the rewind button. Once I do it I'll let you know more.  UPDATE: I am returning the dvd as hip hop is not really my thing.  I thought the moves would be more jazzy.  Not to say it's not a good dvd, it is just not my cup of tea.  A little too young for me. Hopefully Karen Gayle will come out with an intermediate modern dance dvd.  She would be very good at it.",1186444800,19,2055,4.044776119402985
2864107,3,B000RDO27C,"This is a great intro to Hip Hop. I personally prefer the Jamie King DVD over this one as it's just not as aesthetically appealing. The routine is entertaining and a little easier than the Jamie King DVD but I still enjoyed it. As with Jamie King's DVD, I didn't find a huge workout or sweat element with this DVD but it was overall great fun.",1246233600,2,343,4.212121212121212
2864108,5,B000RDO27C,"I'm a beginner. Karen is the best dance teacher ever, I practice her lessons everyday and improve everyday. Moves and techniques are thoroughly explained. Way to dance properly from the beginning. The more I practice her lessons the easier I pick them up and any other moves I encounter outside.

For people who get confused by the mirror or opposite mirror image when following the lessons, I tackle this by placing the screen in front of a wardrobe size mirror, stand between the screen and the mirror and follow the images in the mirror, sometimes when it's confusing, i'll just look back at the screen, it's like the instructors are dancing behind me moving the same way with me.",1237939200,5,683,4.739495798319328
2864109,3,B000RDO27C,"I'm not a young woman, but I usually catch on pretty quickly.  This video was too hard for me to follow and I gave up frustrated.  It would be great for someone who is younger, fitter, and has some hip hop dance in their blood.  For me, I was never trained in hip hop and never even tried it, so it was just beyond me.",1235088000,7,318,3.8615384615384616
2864110,3,B000RDO27C,"Street fusion dvd is not so easy to do. It starts with a dance for beginners. But definitely its not for beginners. Karen Gayle teaches so fast that you can't follow all the moves. It would be better if she can teach slower. But the choreography is good. If you know how to dance Hip-hop, its ok for you.",1226188800,8,304,4.169491525423729
2864111,5,B000RDO27C,"Karen Gayle with her enviable agility, solid technique and creativity, has put together a DVD of the latest in dance styles, a blend of modern jazz and hip hop, that is a blast from start to finish. After the ""Welcome,"" there's a ""Warm-up"" that includes marvelous stretches, isolations and footwork, and does well on its own, if used as a short daily workout to strengthen and tone your body.

There are 3 ""Dance Routines,"" labeled Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. Though there is not that much difference in their level of difficulty in the actual steps, there's quite a bit to remember in the choreography, and there's the jazzy and fun style to assimilate. The routines are broken down step by step first, and then are danced continuously with music to practice until you get it right. Finally there's a ""Demo"" of Karen and her 4 dancers (Jessi, Liz, Radhia and Kiyomi), giving it there all and wowing us with their moves. Music is by Jay T. Jenkins and Mervyn Theodopolis Jr., Daryl ""D. Roe"" Monroe, and Ray Johnson.

Slim, leggy and beautiful, Karen Gayle is a superb dancer (watching her, I can't help thinking how much the great Bob Fosse would have loved her to dance for him!) and she knows how to impart her knowledge, and choreograph interesting pieces, making this DVD a valuable addition to your dance instruction library!",1222819200,12,1339,4.792207792207792
2864112,4,B000RDO27C,Product delivered exactly what was promised. Easy to follow- gives a good work out and helps to develop skill.,1221955200,4,110,4.842105263157895
2864113,5,B000RDO27C,this is the best dance teaching video ever with awesome dances in hip hop...I have bought this several times,1213401600,,108,4.7368421052631575
2864114,3,B000RDO27C,"I was hoping for more of a workout routine... this is a slow-paced dance instructional video.  It gets you moving, but no really heart-pumping activity.  Fun to learn new moves but won't work for my cardio.",1212451200,8,206,4.694444444444445
2864115,2,B000RDO27C,"I will try to be as objective as possible although my conclusions are based on my expectations. I expected a DVD that would substitute my hip-hop class for the days I can't attend it. Something that will make me sweat and have me learn new choreography, on top of some funky music. Well, this DVD didn't deliver any of these three things. The warm-up is slow (lots of explanation in stead of just getting into it), really basic, and it will not make you break a sweat (it lasts about 15 minutes). The three routines are okay, but because of the low production value and generic beats, I really didn't want to stick with it long enough to learn it. And frankly, everybody who teaches choreography from the TV should know that a back shot is absolutely obligatory in order not to be confused and have to translate the movements in the opposite direction. A big reason why I didn't stick with the choreography also.

If you only want to learn some choreography, have a lot of patience, and don't mind dancing only to beats, then this will work for you.",1211155200,42,1049,4.492146596858639
2864116,3,B000RDO27C,"This is good only if you want to learn how to dance, not if you're going to use dance as a way of exercise.

Karen goes a little fast, so I got frustrated after a while and turned it off.  She spends longer on the easy moves, but flies through the difficult ones.

I reccommed Jennifer Gardalini(spelling of last name)  if you want to dance for an actual purpose.",1210550400,4,363,4.217391304347826

8199996,5,B000RDO27C,I was so happy to find this video since there are no hip hop classes in my area.  It has a good warm up and three levels of fun hip hop routines.  It is taught at a comfortable pace and Karen Gayle is very good at breaking down the moves.,1384646400,,238,3.74
8199997,4,B000RDO27C,"This DVD is what I call a choreography DVD. What I mean by this is that each of the three segments contains more than 3 eight count combinations of moves that do not repeat themselves, neither in the same 8 count nor in the full segment. This type of format is quite challenging for a non-dancer. Your movement memory and coordination need to be very good to enjoy this type of exercise, otherwise you'll feel a bit frustrated. I put this DVD away and thought I had wasted (or anticipated) my money. This DVD is for more advanced dancers, definitely not for beginners or occasional social dancers like myself.

Karen includes several ""from the tops"", so if you really stick to it and keep and keep doing it, you'll get the moves sufficiently good to dance along. I own this DVD for more than two years now and I can dance through the first of the three choreographies. Devora's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-s-Hip-Hop-Dance-Grooves-Country-Style-DVD/dp/B004H2S8ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D's Hip Hop Dance Grooves Country Style DVD</a>&nbsp;is also a choreography DVD but the movements and combinations in themselves are much easier than Karen's. However, Devora did not include a tutorial, so if you catch moves easily, Devora's routines might also interest you; they are definitely easier and more suited for social occasions than Karen's (you dance basically in one place, whereas Karen's choreos are more performance type).

If you prefer a dance based workout rather than a choreography, try Kari's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kari-Anderson-Sweat-Express-2/dp/B00501LNSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kari Anderson: Sweat Express 2</a>, this one is is also challenging for beginners and without tutorial, but each 4 count is repeated throughout the segment until the song and its few combinations are ""gone"", so you do not need to memorize which move comes next quickly one after the other without repetition in the full segment. ""Dance off the inches"" DVDs are even more basic; in each segment each 4 count is repeated several times as an exercise and then changed to another 4 count, etc., so the full segment has a couple of different moves that are easily managed.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium TONING: Low CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Intermediate to advanced INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good MUSIC: Good FUN FACTOR: None until you master it, then it is very good.

CONTENTS:
1) Warm up - Dancy warm up for dancers (includes several rib cage and hip isolations, as well as nice stretches). It is good but a bit fast paced for a warm up (specially for beginners). Precautions must be taken even in the warm up (I have a knee injury and my knees started ""warning"" me during this warm-up, so take care, even if you need more time to get into the right position).
2) Three different dance segments, the difficulty grows with each one
3) Cool down

MUSIC:
The songs are good (pop) and also match perfectly to the routines.

EMPHASIS:
This is a choreography DVD, not a fitness or workout type of routine, so there is no specific fitness emphasis, except for cardio when you dance the full speed routines.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Nice and interesting choreographies, full of details (head tilts, accents, gestures, etc.).
+ Good instruction, pointing to all the different details and postures
+ FUN: If you are a good dancer this DVD is definitely for you.",1383696000,2,3460,5.28
8199998,3,B000RDO27C,"This video is decent, but it's mainly combinations, and I didn't totally fall in love with them or think that the layout of the video was particularly engaging...",1361145600,,162,4.821428571428571
8199999,1,B000RDO27C,Dont buy this. I love dancing and can get into alot of things but this dvd was just plain terrible!,1322438400,,99,4.0

8200001,4,B000RDO27C,"I bought Street Fusion because I wanted a fun, aerobic workout.  Because I hadn't exercised in so long, it was great for the first couple of weeks.  If you do the warm-up, the isolations and then the step guide you'll get about 20 minutes of very easy work.  The dancing, I would say, is definitely not for beginners.  If you were a pretty good cheerleader dancer in high school in the last 15 years, her instruction and the dances will feel like learning a high school dance again.  Gayle is pretty good about going slowly through the steps and breaking them down with lots of instruction and repetition.  And there's the problem with the whole dvd if you want a workout.  The only way to keep your heart rate going at all is to keep the remote  handy and fast forward through the instruction.  I wish she had done 2 takes of the isolations and step guide-- one with instructions and one without-- like she did with the dances.  I still use this video. I do her warm-up and isolations (with the remote close by) and then I do an aerobic dance with Jennifer Galardi's ""Dance off the inches:  Hip Hop Party.",1264896000,2,1106,4.425742574257426
