1407504,4,B000059MQ2,"I caught ""The Proposal"" on the Movie Network this summer, and I must admit that I was unable to let myself change the channel, mostly for two reasons: wanting to discover more, and Jennifer Esposito's magnetic presence.
Esposito is a fantastic actress, and although her performance in this film is thrilling, it made me feel as if she got even better. I wasn't as impressed with Nick Moran: I never really became sure of whether he was uninspired or simply playing a very stoic character.
Having found myself beginning to watch at some point into the film, I was a bit confused as to the exact plot(especially during the falling action). However, I loved it. I'm a huge fan of police- and FBI- related storylines.
I have to say that I was overall quite satisfied with ""The Proposal"". I've been looking for it at every place where videos can be rented or sold, and I've only found it in French(which makes me so mad... but I won't get into political opinion now). But as soon as I find it, I'm taking it home for sure.",1035504000,3,1017,4.5027027027027025
1407505,3,B000059MQ2,"I'm in love with Jennifer Esposito ever since I first saw her in ""Spin City"". This movie is watchable enough, and has a pretty good ending that saves it from obscurity.  Jenny gets to wear a number of different outfits, but not the one shown on the cover - work that one out!
Your kids could watch this one.",1019001600,2,307,4.203389830508475
1407506,5,B000059MQ2,"""The Proposal"" is an intelligent, first-rate undercover police story with a lot of twists and turns that you can never see coming. The Director has a real knack for building tension and suspense... it keeps increasing as the story progresses, and the mystery deepens as it unfolds. Jennifer Esposito really proves that she can play the leading role in a feature... she's radiant, and Nick Moran (from ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"") plays the nervous, paranoid undercover cop to perfection. Stephen Lang (Tombstone) is awesome as the subtly psychotic Crime lord, and it's nice to see William B. Davis (X-files' Smoking Man) play an FBI agent who DOESN'T smoke! Very clever, unpredictable, good looking film noir. Highly recommended.",998697600,14,740,5.226890756302521
1407507,4,B000059MQ2,This was clever thriller about a undercover cop sent in to take a ruthless mobster only to find out that to keep his cover he must have a wife in short notice! He  gets a rookie policewoman to pose as his wife and she becomes object of desire of the same gangster she is sent in to nail. This film's script writers took pains to sent up movie up with lots of suspense as our hero must try to keep his cover and trust his new partner with his case and  his life. The script writers also give us one dandy final twist at the end that fooled me and will fool you too!,990316800,6,564,3.93859649122807
1407508,4,B000059MQ2,"The Proposal is a detective story that takes a familiar storyline and gives it a few interesting twists. Good characters and great script make this a worthy film to see.
The story is about an undercover detective (Moran) who leads a paranoid existence, constantly vigilant against being found out for who he really is. In order to keep his cover intact, he reluctantly accepts a new partner (Esposito) who apparently has no undercover training and whose inexperience may eventually place his life in jeopardy.
The Proposal takes you into the personal life of a detective who has been ""under"" for several months to infiltrate a crime organization and shows the great lengths he must go through to establish his identity while at the same time watch his own back.
The film's antagonist, Simon Bacig (Lang) is great. He is a villain's villain who plays dangerous, eccentric, and vain - all without going ""over the top"".
Great direction and script give this movie dimension and depth that allow you to get in touch with the characters and keep you hooked as you await the final outcome (which I guarantee, you won't be able to guess).",987811200,7,1130,4.829896907216495

7933724,4,B000059MQ2,The Proposal had good plot involving two cops and a kingpin in this film with Jennifer Esposito. Esposito however had good talent and sexy personality in this film and in reality. Good movie and Esposito is my favorite actress in real life.,1392595200,,240,4.738095238095238

7933727,3,B000059MQ2,"great movie.  no.  but entertaining and I 'm a Jennifer Esposito fan.  Still haven't forgiven CBS for letting her go from Blue Bloods.  But my main reason for writing this review is to find out if anyone has ever been able to find the soundtrack for this movie.  I absolutely love the music, especially the song played with closing credits.  Unfortunately, because it has the same title as the Sandra Bullock/Ryan Reynolds comedy I can find all kinds of music for that, but not this great jazz music.  If you've been able to find it please let me know.",1309219200,,552,4.515151515151516
