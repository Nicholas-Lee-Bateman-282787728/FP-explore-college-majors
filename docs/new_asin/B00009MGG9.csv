Claro que comprendo que una pelicula que trata de la vida y muerte de un sicario tiene que ser muy violenta, pero hay escenas que parecen salir de la mente de un sadico, o por lo menos hechas para voyeurs sadicos.",1357516800,,340,4.483870967741935
7991838,5,B00009MGG9,"I first watched this movie because I saw it on a shelf & decided to see what it was about. Was I in for a surprise! It also began my infatuation with Laureano Olivares.
It's a heart-breaking story that takes place in Colombia but it's a Venezuelan production. I don't speak Spanish well enough to recognize accents so I'm not bothered by that. I was probably in shock the first time I saw it. The ending was so sad & it really touched me.
I highly recommend watching the rest of the trilogy (Huelepega & Oro Diablo/Garimpeiros) if you can find them. The really heart-wrenching thing about the movie (& the rest of the trilogy) is that the storyline(s) are based on real life events but to what extent I don't know.",1330819200,,714,4.416666666666667
7991839,2,B00009MGG9,"Filmed in Colombia and based on a true story fo the life of a sicario, AKA assassin for hire! The boring movies ia about a small boy who becomes a sicario in order to support his family! The movies was made with a very small budget, no real acting here, amateurs at its best. It does discloses the real life drama of the varios-projects in Colombia.",1219449600,,349,4.303030303030303

La pelicula cuenta con una buena historia, buena trama, excelentes actores que plasman en la pantalla la cruda realidad de la juventud en sur america. Pobres de todo, el hambre, la miseria, el sistema le dan a esta pelicula una historia de muchas historias terribles de jovenes que no sobreviven los 24 aos de edad. Excelente produccion se quedan cortos los elojios y por eso los tantos premios. No dejen de verla. El personaje de Jairo y su madre son expectaculares sumamente reales. Hay que apoyar producciones como esta.",1136073600,,604,4.87378640776699

The director Jose Ramon Novoa's SICARIO (Il Maestro in Venezuela)show to all of us how the poverty (Barrio's Family) react against the rich. And the corruption of the Police, fitting in all dirty life of the city.

Novoa's put toghere older and youngers as sicarios to kill politicos friend, just for a cause to be on top of the power.

Jairo (Laureano Olivarez) young actor, seem director like is talent, also in the movie ""Oro Diablo"", for is young age, he give us, exellent job when he linked the contact he made with the head of guerrillas, who they traffic army,cocaine and well trained young sicarios.

Tipic life out Caracas City. In the barrio's where the poverty strangoled all young and desperately with no guide they find wrong world to survive.

Spectacular Movie.

Beautiful and rich in some part of the movie where the Director Novoa's teach the all young actors, life is not easy.

Young should be strong, decisive, men's characters to understain that will be the only one way you can survive.

The decision is also to belive the potential of the new generation and they should thing kill is not the write thing to project the future!

One of the best films I've ever seen since ""The Lady of The Assasin"" ( Colombian Movie).

For same young in Venezuela life is ""Gold Gift of the God"", but for the youngers in the Barrio's ""The survive is the firs issue of the sunshine"".

Enjoy the Movie!

The movie is spectacular.",1096070400,6,203,5.548387096774194
7991843,4,B00009MGG9,"Another strong entry in the Latin American crime film sub-genre, Jose Ramon Novoa's Sicario, set in Bogota, is a riveting thriller which, though somewhat formulaic, makes the most of its emphasis on how poverty drives people to acts of desperation.
As is true of several crime films set in Latin America (City of God, Johnny One Hundred Pesos, and others), Sicario centers on street youths who resort to crime to bring in the money they have so little of.  Here, Jairo, 13 or 14, lives with his mother, younger brother, and an even younger sister.  He quickly falls in with an older youth who eventually brings him to a contact linked to the guerillas (one suspects FARC, although it could be another group) who are heavy traffickers in cocaine, one of Colombia's premier cash crops, unfortunately.
Eventually conscripted to the inner sanctum of a top drug lord, Jairo is assigned to assassinate a key political figure.  This occurs after he's dispatched two or three lower level politicos and the drug lord is sure he can do the job.  In the midst of his violent activity and occasional visits to whorehouses, he finds time to be with his girlfriend for whom, as is true of his mother, he gives most of his ill-gotten gains.
Every act of violence seen in the film is critical to the plot, and the actors do an excellent job conveying the characters they portray.  The director has some cinematic tricks up his sleeve but does not overuse them; the viewer senses Novoa is a smart filmmaker who knows his craft well.
Colombia's film output is relatively low, but this is certainly one of the best films from that country.
Recommended.",1085616000,5,1633,4.735915492957746
