8125075,3,B000FOA9AW,"This movie is about a courtesan (Divya Bharati) who finds out as her 'mother' dies that this woman wasn't her mother. She goes looking for the truth of her past with a young man (Shahrukh Khan) who has fallen in love with her at first sight. The plot gets interesting as she finds (in 'Mamma Mia' like fashion) that her mother could be one of 3 best school friends who are now pillars of society - but which one...?

It unfortunately is looking dated. The poor film quality of the day is one reason but also the dances and hairdos were looking were looking rather 80s (even though it's 1992) Some of the dances were neither sensuous Indian nor really had the Western look of something like 'Flashdance' they looked like they were going for. None of the music stayed with me either (and it was very strings based in this era).

HOWEVER the movie wasn't too bad despite a few cringes at the dances. I got quite involved in the plot and more interested in it that many others of this period. The acting is also quite strong from quite a few of the support cast. It is an early SRK movie and he does well with the part but actually his part is eclipsed by some strong acting by actors of the earlier generation of actors (e.g. Jeetendra, Mithun Chakraborty, Sonu Walia). He holds his own well despite that.

So overall I warmed to this one as I hung in for the plot resolution. It tends to get average to a little above elsewhere on the Net- and that's where I'd place it too.",1242000000,3,1472,4.326086956521739
