8180476,5,B000NPP9G2,"Gotta give this one 5 stars because it's Kentucky taking back what the title. Syracuse was a very good team, but no match for a team that sent 8(!)players to the NBA. The game itself was good, though both teams shot poorly overall. A lot of this was due to the fact that the game was played on a court over a hockey rink, with the floor sweating from the ice. Players were slip sliding away for a while. That was a real disservice to the tournament and the fans. I hope this absurdity never happens again. This UK team is the best college men's team I've never seen.",1242259200,,566,4.201834862385321
