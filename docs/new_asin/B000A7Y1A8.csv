8324951,5,B000A7Y1A8,"This is a simple view of this Spanish mystic, however,  the presenters open up a vast view of the female position in the Church at her  time and how St. Teresa navigates around being caught by the Inquisition.

8324953,5,B000A7Y1A8,This DVD is an excellent overview on the life and teachings of Teresa of Avila.  A wonderful blend of ecumenical scholarly voices share their insights as they provide the backdrop for those who may not be familiar with the Spanish Mystics.,1364169600,,239,4.829268292682927
8324954,1,B000A7Y1A8,"A few minutes into this uninspiring documentary on Teresa of Avila, I saw some woman with a 'butch-cut' hairstyle and wearing roman collar being interviewed.  The subtitle referred to her as a priest.  I stopped the DVD, and threw it in the trash!  No further review necessary.
