2332065,4,B0009WPL0I,"Most knockout compilations suck. It's just a plain fact. You get ahold of them, usually after forking over a lump of hard-earned dough, and after one or two viewings of a string of badly edited, often poor-quality KOs presented without any context, they gather dust somewhere on a back shelf until the inevitable yard sale. Bo-ring.

PRIDE FC - HARDCORE KNOCKOUTS VOL. I is a pleasant exception to this rule. It is a slickly packaged, well-produced and reasonably well commentated 110 minutes of some of the nastiest KOs to occur in the legendary PRIDE ring. Fans of MMA and of PRIDE fighting in particular will not be disappointed in what I hope is the first of a several-volume series.

The DVD is hosted by current IFL representative and former MMA legend Bas Rutten, and PRIDE's ringside commentator, Mauro Renallo. Rutten is maybe a bit too caffinated to give his best performance here, but nobody at the Kraft Services table was gonna tell ""El Guapo"" he couldn't have that sixth cappucino. Renallo, with his Brent Mussberger voice and Jim Lampley diction, is slightly annoying as always, but otherwise does his job of lobbing semi-rhetorical questions at Bas with skill and aplomb.

Now for the good stuff. HARDCORE KNOCKOUTS is a densely-layered highlight reel combining random one-punch KOs, the career-best KOs of various marquee fighters, and several important PRIDE fights in their entirety.

The disc starts with a series of brutal knockouts from various PRIDE cards, including some stunners by Ken Shamrock, Gary ""Big Daddy"" Goodridge and Gilbert Yvel. It segues into the best performances of Fedor Emilianenko, Wanderlei Silva, Mirko Cro Cop, Quinten ""Rampage"" Jackson, Chuck ""the Iceman"" Liddell and Igor Vovchanchyn. There are some vicious, vicious beatings here, especially by Cro Cop, Volvchanchyn and Silva. One of the most spectacular, however, is Rampage's ""slam knockout"" of Ricardo Arona. Holy @#%!

Fights shown in entirety are Wanderei Silva vs. Kazushi ""the Gracie Hunter"" Sakuraba, Mirko Cro Cop vs. Kevin ""the Monster"" Randelman, and Chuck Liddell vs. Rampage Jackson. Fans of Liddell will not enjoy this last one, it is a well-and-true butt-kicking, probably thrown in to draw interest in the upcoming rematch.

Some flaws: 1) Alexander Emilianenko, the tattoed kid brother of Fedor, is seen here only getting brutally KO'd by Cro Cop. This man has several spectacular KOs to his credit, but none are pictured here. 2) The commentators, despite aknowledging that PRIDE has been bought by the UFC, can't help taunting Chuck Liddell about losing to Rampage in PRIDE, drawing the conclusion that UFC fighters can't quite cut the mustard in the PRIDE ring. I realize this was just chest-thumping for the org that pays their wages, and I realize that Cro Cop hasn't fared so well since going UFC, but hey -- this is Chuck we're talking about. It ain't wise to upset a Wookie. 3) Several of Fedor Emilianenko's ""best KOs"" are actually not KOs, they are fights he won by decision -- in other words, they are highlights, not knockouts. 4) No Don Frye (except as a victim).

Having made that qualification (and keeping in mind there should be other volumes coming) I would definitely recommend this disc to anyone who enjoys MMA and wants to see some true beatdowns delivered by, and sometimes to, the greatest fighters in the PRIDE ring.",1178150400,16,3358,5.028776978417266

2332067,3,B0009WPL0I,"for the most part this was a boring event. Most of the fights were of the slow paced, cautious variety that saw very few exciting flurries. There were a couple of fights that were entertaining so it is not a total waste of time to see. Overall though, this was an average Pride show at best. If you have a limited budged, save your money for 'Critical Countdown 2004' as that is one of the best events money can buy right now.",1153958400,,426,4.2073170731707314
2332068,4,B0009WPL0I,"PRIDE or PRIDE Fighting Championships is the largest mixed martial arts organization in the world. It is based in Japan and currently promoted by Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE). Its inaugural event was held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997, promoted by Kakutougi Revolution Spirits (KRS). It is the most popular MMA organization in the world based on the number of event attendees: the PRIDE Final Conflict 2003 event had over 67,000 people in the audience. The audience record is 91,107 people on the PRIDE and K-1 co-production Shockwave/Dynamite, held in August 2002. It is considered to be the premiere MMA organization on the planet.

PRIDE Bushido is the branch of PRIDE FC that showcases the lighter weight fighters.  Since its inception, early Bushido shows were often criticized by the Japanese media for not having enough action.  In my opinion, Bushido 4 was the turning point that placed Bushido on the path to becoming the hottest event in Mixed Martial Arts today.

Unlike many MMA fight events, you get a ton of bang for your buck.  There are 10 fights on the original PPV fight card with an 11th bonus fight in the Extra Features section of the DVD.  Here is a spoiler-free breakdown of the fights:

Luiz Buscape vs Hiroyuki Abe - 7/10

Dokonjonosuke Mishima vs Marcus Aurelio - 9/10

- a tremendous fight between two top Lightweight fighters.

Amar Suloev vs Dean Lister - 4/10

- What looked like a decent match on paper, turns out to be a terrible snoozefest.

Hayato Sakurai vs Brady Fink - 6/10

- A pretty large mismatch as the legendary Hayato ""Mach"" Sakurai takes on an upstart American in Brady Fink.  Sakurai's original opponent Crosley Gracie, was forced to withdraw due to injury.

Ikuhisa Minowa vs Kenichi Yamamoto - 7/10

- Minowa is a character

Takashi Sugiura vs Giant Silva - 7/10

- Interesting to watch because of the sideshow factor.  The 7'4, 400lbs Giant Silva makes his PRIDE and MMA debut against a much smaller Japanese opponent.

Mirko Filipovic vs Shungo Oyama - 8/10

- Cro Cop makes a huge impact as he returns to the ring after being upset in his previous bout.

Paulo Filho vs Akira Shoji - 8/10

- Very good back-and-forth fight with both men gaining the advantage on momentary occasions.

Takanori Gomi vs Fabio Mello - 9/10

- A tremendous fight between ""The Fireball Kid"" Takanori Gomi and BTT fighter Fabio Mello.  Gomi shows why he's one of the most dynamic and entertaining fighters in the world.

Antonio Rogerio Nogueira vs Kazuhiro Nakamura - 7/10

- After an entertaining tilt in their first fight, Rogerio and Nakamura lock up again in the rematch.  A good fight.

With the its reduced price, I highly recommend Bushido 4 for any Mixed Martial Arts fan.  Their are a few boring fights and some snooze worthy moments, but overall its a pretty high class event.",1152489600,9,2826,4.753086419753086
2332069,4,B0009WPL0I,"In this, the 2nd installment in the ""Legacy"" collection, we have Pride 6-9 and 11. Five Pride events for under $30 is a pretty attractive deal for a fan of mixed martial arts.

On these DVDs, we have some memorable fights and some memorable fighter debuts. Carlos Newton and Daijiro Matsui have the first truly great battle of the collection. They fight hard and nearly evenly for 3 rounds and Newton ultimately wins the decision. Mark Kerr has a few fights and is dealt his first defeat by Igor Vovchanchyn. Igor wins with some illegal knees to the top of Kerr's head, but everyone finally got to see that Kerr can be stopped.

Some fighters who were already familiar to us from the UFC and other MMA organizations also appear in this set. Fighters like Guy Mezger, Vernon White and Tra Telligman. Fighters who make impressive showings in their debuts include Ricco Rodriguez, Mo Smith, Frank Trigg and perhaps most notably Wanderlei Silva. I was particularly shocked, though, by Frank Trigg's showing against Fabiano Iha. He shows impressive submission escape and grappling skills, yet it is his aggression and striking that win him this fight.

Other notable moments include Vitor Belfort coming back from an embarassing loss to Sakuraba to win in impressive fashion over Gilbert Yvel. Heath Herring makes his debut and looks very promising in winning his first two fights. Igor Vovchanchyn scores a shockingly impressive KO of Francisco Bueno. Sakuraba submits Royler Gracie in a somewhat controversial fight (this is where he begins his winning ways with the Gracie family, eventually earning himself the nickname ""The Gracie Hunter""). There are plenty of classic matchups and exciting fights on this 5-event DVD set.

Pride 9 seems to be where the format became a bit more polished and refined. They finally begin incorporating pre-fight interviews into the shows, which helps to make things a bit more interesting and relatable.
This is a great set to own. It's still not quite as exciting as the UFC, but Pride is slowly winning me over.",1149033600,4,2045,4.9533527696793005
2332070,3,B0009WPL0I,"After receiving this product from Amazon I was a little dissapointed. The fights were a bit boring. Too much g&p and not much striking. No extra features that are worth mentioning. The old Pride rules had the first round of 10 minutes.

So in a lot fghts the fighters exchange a few strikes and then go to the ground. Not too much is happening there and if there is no submission then you have to wait 10 minutes until the next round starts.

The DVD release is plain and simple and I would have expected more of a show. The other bad thing is that on some DVD`s there are 2 sides and you have to switch the DVD.

OK I heard that from Pride 13 they changed the rules and it is getting exciting.",1148515200,,694,4.125925925925926
2332071,5,B0009WPL0I,"There's a huge difference between this set and Legacy Vol. 1, as this one is full of action, and includes the debut of some legends in this recently born sport.
This pack includes the events where Pride FC absorbed the best fighters in the world. They took place between 1999 and 2000, when Silva, Sakuraba, Vovchanchyn, Kerr, Goodridge, Goes and Herring helped to slowly establish Pride as the only place where the best fighters could make a name for themselves.
I would say that here you'll find the second big MMA generation, as Royce, Ken Shamrock, Frye, Severn and Oleg constitute the first one. In this second generation, we start to enjoy the first really well rounded fighters, and some very entertaining stand up skills.
During this period of time, UFC had its pick moment, and slowly started to lose it's place. I guess every MMA fan would have dreamed to see Frank, Tito, Randy and Bas, fighting in these events, but they stayed at the UFC.
The only flaw in this box set, is that it doesn't include Pride number 10, surely because is so good that they want to sell it separately. Anyway..., a must have!",1142812800,3,1114,4.6313131313131315
2332072,5,B0009WPL0I,"While the first Legacy set seems to revolve around Sakuraba (obviously not meant to purposefully since it is simply the first five events), this set represents the rise of the Axe Murderer.

See his first fight in the PRIDE ring to work his way up to legendary status.

There is also some great fights here for the Sakuraba fans too.  For instance, Royler Gracie vs. Saku in PRIDE 8.  Classic fight.  Let yourself judge it.

Get this DVD as soon as it comes out; certainly seems to be the best way to collect the PRIDE Fighting Championship events.",1126915200,5,548,4.540816326530612

This very early set really showcases emerging stars such as Igor ""Ice Cold"" Vovchanchyn, Heath ""Texas Crazy Horse"" Herring, and Wanderlei ""The Axe Murderer"" Silva setting the pace for Pride as the new leader in delivering MMA action and drama. Along with the young guns, veterans such as ""Big Daddy"" Gary Goodridge, Mark ""The Hammer"" Coleman, and Kazushi Sakuraba continue to show dominance and entertain crowds with their brand of Pride MMA.

Kazushi Sakuraba gets better with every fight... Originally just a grappler with great Ju-Jitsu skills, he really matures once he adds effective strikes to his game.

As soon as Wanderlei Silva enters Pride, the quality of fighting improves drastically.

The obvious drawback of this box set is that it doesn't include Pride 10... Shamrock vs. Fujita, Belfort vs. Matsui, Metzger vs. Silva, and of course the infamous flying Kimura Sakuraba used to snap Renzo Gracie's elbow.

2332088,5,B0009WPL0I,"Pride FC's Hardcore Knockouts vol. 1 is THE BEST knockout compilation that I've ever seen. Now, I should state that I am a hardcore fan of both the Pride FC and the UFC, and I've seen all 5 UFC Ultimate knockout dvds and this one is my favorite so far. The way they did the editing on here is absolutely amazing. They keep the Ko action hard, fast and brutal and they also manage to  give you plenty of replays of each and every Ko.

This first edition of Hardcore Knockouts gives you hi-light reel material from Wanderlei Silva, Mirko Cro Cop,Chuck Liddell,Igor Vovchanchyn,Quinton Jackson and more. They also show hi-lights from Fedor's brutal G&P of Heath Herring,Nogueira, and Fujita. '

I can't recommend this Knockout dvd enough, I used to have it on psp before they released it on dvd. I can't tell you how many times I've watched this over and over and over again.

BUSHIDO

1. HIROYUKI ABE VS LUIZ FIRMINO-the first fight is excellent with one getting dropped right from the start, Luiz is a killer. The fight is quick lasting only 2 plus minutes with Abe getting put to sleep with an arm triangle. Still it was a very entertaining fight with a great finish in which the loser shows the warrior spirit. 5/5

2. DOKONJONOSUKE MISHIMA VS MARCUS AURELIO-the first round in this one is one of the best I have witnessed. Both guys go out and attack, from top and bottom both guys give it their all. There are some vicious shots from the top and some great submission attempts. The second and final round is just as amazing and is another round of some of the best ground fighting there has ever been. Plus after the round is over the still compete, and it is very funny. Mishima ends up getting the split decision in this excellent fight. 5/5

3. AMAR SULOEV VS DEAN LISTER-the first round is pretty good with your classic grappler vs striker fight. The action is good but lacking a little since the ref gave them a red card each for stalling. Lister ends the round strong finally getting the take down. The second round is just like the first with both respecting each other to much. They also get another red card each with is another 10% off of their check. Amar gets the split decision in this one, not a bad fight at all but they fought not to lose. 3/5

4. HAYATO SAKURAI VS BRADY FINK-excellent fight right here with both guys doing very well, regardless of cards. The fight ends in the first after some good back and forth action, but it is Sakurai  who wins. After a near miss soccer kick he puts Fink to sleep with a guillotine choke. 4/5

5. IKUHISA MINOWA VS KENICHI YAMAMOTO-we follow that fight with another fun fight that ends in the first round. Both come out hard but it is Minowa who comes out the strongest, taking him down and pounding on him. He eventually makes his way to mount and rains down heavy and quick bombs. 4.5/5

6. TAKASHI SUGIURA VS GIANT SILVA-now this fight is unbelievable because of the size difference, Giant Silva is literally a giant. That is what makes it so crazy because Sugiura totally dominates the fight, and ends it in the first. 5/5

7. MIRKO ""CRO COP"" FILIPOVIC VS SHUNGO OYAMA-one of the greatest fighters of all time is back and ready to do some damage. He does just that as Cro Cop demolishes Oyama, it lasts less than a minute or so. The striking this man lets loose is deadly, he dominates Oyama. 5/5

BRAZILIAN TOP TEAM VS TEAM JAPAN

8. PAULO FILHO VS AKIRA SHOJI-the first fight of the BTT vs Team Japan stars with a whole round of feeling out. They both get a red card so they loose some money but they land some good strikes. The second round is very close and the pace picks up a little but it goes to decision, Filho takes a split decision and a win for BTT.3.5/5

9. TAKANORI GOMI VS FABIO MELLO-in this fight Japan gets their win in a great showing by Gomi. Gomi is one of the best fighters of all time and it shows here in this fight. He decimates Mello with some heavy shots, punches and knees to the body that end the fight. 5/5

10. ANTONIO ROGERIO NOGUEIRA VS KAZUHIRO NAKAMURA-the first round is a little slow at first but Little Nog kicks it up towards the end of the round. Both Little and Big Nog are some of my favorite fighters ever, so you know who I was rooting for. The second round is better with a little more action on both parts, but it is Nog who gets the win and BTT takes home the victory. 4/5

BONUS

11. KYOSUKE SASAKI VS EIJI MITSUOKA-the first round was very good with Eiji controlling most of the round. He went for submissions and got take downs and basically won the round easy. Still Sasaki did a great job defending everything and even pleased the crowd some with a slam with his opponent on his back. The second round was a little les active but was still very good the thing is because of special rules since no one finished the fight it became a draw. 4/5",1280534400,,3992,4.31951871657754
