8361639,1,6304622465,"This animated version of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel was disappointing for several reasons.  1) the complex plot doesn't lend itself to a short animation and as a result the simplified story line offered in the tape is incoherent. Why was Cornelius imprisoned?  Was his godfather a good character or an evil one?  2)The graphics are primitive and VERY scary.  The eight year old girl who viewed it to the end (she always does, no matter what!) was often distracted and her five year old brother was bored and left the room before the scary parts forced us to turn off the tape. 3)The attempts to make the story appealing to young children by adding animal characters further confuse the plot and make the story untecognizable to anyone who, like me, has read and enjoyed the book.
