4504186,5,B004Z0T0GQ,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am used to watching Bollywood movies, and I love them. This is a very cute Disney twist on the typical Bollywood film. If you are looking to broaden your child's horizons and have a fun 2.5 hour experience, then I completely recommend this movie.",1337904000,,277,4.56
4504187,1,B004Z0T0GQ,"Disney + Bollywood + bland acting, pointless script, decades old CGI effects = a lot of fast forwarding

Acting: It wasn't clear if the actors were just given bland roles or if their acting skills just made their characters that much more forgettable. Sort of like human anime, but I'm not disparaging the concept that someone has to start somewhere. What seems to be missing in their resumes is you either develop it from interesting and challenging early life experiences or you work your butt off and acquire it - neither seems to have occurred in this case.

Script: Another decades old retread of evil female seeking immortality through blood and/or artifact and also happens to have some CGI snake like qualities. Popular myth of the far east of part snake, part woman as seen in ""Hisss"" and in the west in ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""Gorgon"".
The CGI was standard Disney unimaginative - lot's of fake fire; green screen snake statues everywhere; cheap costuming such as usual and boring by now - skeleton masks. The blind Zatoichi like Japanese samurai warrior has been around for forty years and in this case the writers seemed to have unimaginatively copied/resurrected our old Zatoichi. The original was much more interesting.",1327968000,,1236,4.909090909090909
4504188,3,B004Z0T0GQ,"The lavish, over-the-top Once Upon Warrior, is apparently somewhat most typical of what hit ""Bollywood"" films are ""supposed"" to be, at least based on my limited knowledge of them and my daughter's observations of films she watches at the home of our Indian neighbors. That makes it a rather unique experience for American audiences unacquainted with the ""typical"" genre.

Once Upon A Warrior is a full-blown action/adventure/fantasy, drenched in color and detail and played to the hilt by its cast. It comes complete with a dashing, rebellious hero, a lovely and mysterious maiden and a Maleficent-like evil witch to whom power is everything.

The film veers from grim, serious drama to broad comedy, not always seamlessly. Again, I'm looking at it with an inexperienced eye, so perhaps it's just perfect to the Indian audience, to whom it is is primarily directed. There is a lot of action violence, including a scene in which the hero has his eyes stabbed out (we really don't see, but we know), so it's not for everyone.

The songs are the most interesting aspect. This is something I am told is a staple of Bollywood movies, in which the actors seem to completely break out in song and change their attitude as they bop and sing to the bouncy tune. It's a little jarring at times and kind of amusing.

But perhaps that is the intent -- we're not supposed to take any of this too seriously, let's take a break and have some fun and dance a bit. It's certainly an entertaining thine to behold.",1314230400,5,1495,4.716475095785441

8449116,5,B004Z0T0GQ,"The reason I bought this movie title is that I love foreign cultures other than my own. Story from opening to the end is wonderful. Costume designs and background drop, really cool. Even though I don't speak that language I can see the actions are pretty funny,  and makes you fall in love, maybe the actresses are a real catch, you will not take you eyeballs off such charming personalities... Music too is easy listening, hey, it's Disney after all. I listen to Celine Dion's French version or Jon Secada's  Spanish versions too, I don't have a problem with that. It reminds me of the other Disney's title Mulan, Prince of Persia, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor and Sinbad's Golden Journey. I recommend if you like that sort of fantasies.",1418601600,,736,4.653846153846154
8449117,3,B004Z0T0GQ,"I picked this film up with high expectations of great visual effects and a neat story, I was not disappointed. It did take a bit to get into (since a lot of Bollywood films have an element of cheesiness about them- not all of course), but after the first quarter of the film I was into the story and enjoying the characters and visual effects. It was not a great film, but I did enjoy it and would recommend taking the time to watch it.",1379203200,,436,4.141176470588236

8449120,3,B004Z0T0GQ,"This was a fun to watch movie.  It was a colorful fantasy story with the traditional, witch, hero, and love story.  Not too used to have a goofy hero.  It works in some scenes, didn't in others.  I think it is a good kids story to watch.",1367366400,,237,3.978723404255319
