2388801,3,B000AFA9CY,"The movie was okay but, it needed a lot work to become great. Will Hutchins should of not been assigned this roll. He projected this roll very weak, Needed someone stronger in this roll like a Clint Walker type to make impact. Otherwise this dvd was okay. It brings back great memories........Keep up the great work.",1399680000,,316,4.660714285714286

2388804,5,B000AFA9CY,"This excellent overview of TV Westerns hosted by 'Sugarfoot' star Will Hutchins has until now only had a previous release by Good Times Video on VHS back in 1993.  It has taken 20 years to see the light of day on DVD and it is highly welcomed.  Sandy Oliveri produced this package for Good Times, as well as a number of other absolutely great releases back in the VHS era, and I can only hope this will open the gates for more of Oliveri's vintage productions to follow. Returning the subject to this release, it's filled with vintage show intros, scenes, bloopers, commercials and some focusing on a number of the TV Western series stars. Ah, nostalgia, and what great fun to see so many of the vintage TV Westerns gathered together and spotlighted here.  A real bonus in this package is the addition of 2 hours worth of extras that of course were not part of the original VHS release. Any serious or casual TV Western fan MUST have this DVD in their collection!!",1383091200,14,964,4.497142857142857

2388809,5,B000AFA9CY,"So glad that this is finally on DVD as my worn VHS would no longer track properly. This is an outstanding overview of television Westerns from the 1950s-60s, though a few of my favorites were not included (TOMBSTONE TERRITORY, MACKENZIE'S RAIDERS, and CIMARRON STRIP), you just can't have everything. That said, it's still a great show! Starting with THE LONE RANGER and covering Hoppy, Roy, Cisco and Gene and Gene's Flying A offspring, RANGE RIDER, BUFFALO BILL JR., and ANNIE OAKLEY and moving on to SGT. PRESTION, HAWKEYE and others we arrive at the ""adult"" cycle with WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE, TRACKDOWN and others. WAGON TRAIN, RAWHIDE, GUNSMOKE and BONANZA are well covered, complete with bloopers and commercials, though it pained me somewhat to see Amanda Blake promoting cigarettes. Nick Adams did the same while he was featured as a teenager (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE?), which would not go over too good these days!
Still, the highlight of all of this is really the host himself, Will Hutchins. Will does the whole guest host bit purely tongue in cheek, and his dry witticisms had me rolling in the aisles, especially during his visit to the Gene Autry Museum in which he surveys the exhibits within. He spoofs the era and himself and his presentation is both charming and nostalgic. Will made this program so much more than just a few clips of old Western TV shows.
And yes, some of the clips are well worn, dark and visually challenging, yet others, especially SGT. PRESTON, are ablaze in bright color and sharp clarity. MAVERICK, CHEYENNE, THE RIFLEMAN on through THE BIG VALLEY and LAREDO, lots of trails well worth riding here! And with another 2hrs. of bonus material you just can't go wrong. An absolute must have. There's nothing else like it out there. Buy & enjoy. TV will never again be this great.",1429574400,12,1813,4.795527156549521

2388812,5,B000AFA9CY,"A little bit of everything thrown in and all of it is enjoyable. Shows like ""Have Gun, Will Travel,"" ""Gunsmoke"", and others are covered with some bloopers and Richard Boone's appearance on ""What's My Line.""

8078385,5,B000AFA9CY,"Although they forgot THE VIRGINIAN,this dvd about the history of the TV westerns is a lot of fun to watch. You'll see them all from GUNSMOKE to THE BIG VALLEY and BONANZA.They also have commercials,bloopers and even a few episodes of old shows and stars featured on WHAT'S MY LINE and a JAMES ARNESS interview on THE JOHNNY CARSON SHOW.Upon watching this i think that what killed the westerns is when they started parodying the genre with shows like F-TROOP and LAREDO.For twenty years 1949-1969,the genre ruled AMERICAN tv and we've been missing them ever since. It was quite a ride nevertheless. Worth seeing for sure.",1484179200,3,620,4.8584905660377355
