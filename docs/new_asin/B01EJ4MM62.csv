7736319,1,B01EJ4MM62,WOW is this terrible. If it was a high school kids attempt at movie making I would let it slide but the idea that people could have been paid to act in this is crazy. The entire show is comical. The story is just stupid and acting if that's what you want to call it is just a joke.,1468368000,2,281,3.7796610169491527
7736320,4,B01EJ4MM62,"Great series.  Solid sorry line, good cast & plenty of gore, suspense.",1465257600,3,70,4.833333333333333
7736321,2,B01EJ4MM62,"The only thing scary about this show is the acting.  Not even B-caliber.  The actors are just awful.  They seem like they were pulled out of some college workshop.  Actually,  i insult college workshops saying that. I have seen better acting on the Disney Channel. The show tries to set a creepy mood in its beginnings but then travels into a long winded drawn out soap opera.  From the start we are presented with the woes of an interracial couple and their 2 homosexual married friends, not because of their meaningful story lines but because...well because that's the thing to do nowadays. See Walking Dead Season 6 for more of that.  This stuff is old already and i am tired of being pandered to.  The shows fails because of its need to push these progressive ideas and loses its soul, which is... scare us! With a name like 'slasher' i expect more than a poor attempt at Melrose place with some CG gore thrown in for good measure.  Really really bad.",1464652800,3,955,4.538011695906433
7736322,1,B01EJ4MM62,"Pretty dreadful TV program doesn't even manage to live up to its title.  While the opening scene of a husband and pregnant wife being murdered with a machete on Halloween by a man in a monk costume is pretty well staged and adequately grisly, after that sequence Slasher switches gears and turns into a Seven knockoff as people in a small town are being killed in gruesome fashion in ways that relate to the seven deadly sins (sound familiar)?  Unfortunately, the people in the town have some very dark secrets so nasty that at times it almost seems like the murderer is doing the world a favor by taking these people out.  One problem is that it's hard to care about thoroughly despicable people being murdered, so the program starts to become a drag after a few episodes.  There's also literally only one person in the town who could possibly know all of the various characters' sinful secrets--so why doesn't anybody ever ask that most basic question--how does the killer know all this private stuff about people?  Who would be in a position to know everyone's secrets?  As if that wasn't bad enough that one character who could logically be the killer doesn't even turn out to be the murderer--so if you are a viewer don't bother asking that question yourself since it turns out to be irrelevant to the increasingly nonsensical story.  Unless he is literally omniscient it is impossible for the killer to know everybody's darkest secrets--and without that information, there is no way for the killer to know which people to kill and what deadly sins to link his victims and biblically appropriate murder methods to.

The writing in Slasher is unquestionably bad.  The characters tend to fall into two categories--mind-numbingly stupid or thoroughly repellent.  There is no suspense and no reason for the viewer to care about anything that happens.  Slasher makes MTV's somewhat similar but much smarter Scream look like a masterpiece by comparison.",1464480000,8,1952,4.90273556231003
7736323,5,B01EJ4MM62,Excellent series! Reminded me of an old school 1080s horror movie. The actors were amazing and I am hoping for a Season 2!,1464393600,3,122,4.3478260869565215
7736324,5,B01EJ4MM62,"I just finished watching the first season finale and I'm so glad I decided to give this show a chance. I started watching when it originally aired its fifth or sixth episode, and after feeling unsure after the first episode I kept watching in the hopes it got better and I'm sure it did.
""Slasher"" is a new Canadian anthology horror series is a show that has no fear to shock or disgust viewers. I found it much better than other bigger American current horror shows. The show tells dark stories, provides gore that will please horror fans, and with all the twists and turns that it presents will keep you at the edge of your seat. Another amazing thing about it is that NO ONE is safe; the show is a rollercoaster that won't leave you breathe for a second, you just never know what's going to happen next.
Chiller did an amazing job creating this series, and I'm impatiently waiting for the season 2 announcement because once you dive into this series, you'll be hooked.",1461196800,13,971,4.491525423728813
7736325,5,B01EJ4MM62,Eerie series that I am glad I ordered,1494633600,,37,3.75
7736326,4,B01EJ4MM62,It looked like the MTV  series  Scream  but this A surprise at every turn except what was with the religious parts and just as you think its done guess again the only part I did not like was the very end.,1492300800,,204,3.926829268292683
7736327,5,B01EJ4MM62,"I LOVED this show and am soooooo sad they aren't doing a second season. I finished this sometime last year, and have been waiting for a second season.  While Katie McGrath's acting wasn't all that great, the show kept my attention and had me creeped out for a solid 2 weeks. Entertaining, scary, and interesting. They NEED TO RENEW THIS SHOW. Come on Aaron Martin, bring on season 2.",1490400000,,383,4.550724637681159
7736328,5,B01EJ4MM62,Great dvd. Thanks for excellent service.,1489017600,2,40,5.833333333333333
7736329,1,B01EJ4MM62,"Politically correct slasher surprised someone in a wheel chair isn't the hero....10 minutes in already bored. Low budget acting don't get me wrong I love stuff like Troma but in this the low budget work just doesn't

You want fans? you want viewers? go hard core instead of making sure you have a person from every walk of life that's what sitcoms are for. Invest more into the actors and the story more. Epic fail for something I was looking forward to watching.",1485302400,,463,4.578313253012048

7736331,5,B01EJ4MM62,This Season Was good would like a lot more if S2 gets made.,1477872000,,59,3.6153846153846154
7736332,5,B01EJ4MM62,This was a very good horror show. There is 8 episodes and it keeps you guessing who the killer is. It's a lot better than the Scream tv series.,1475539200,,143,3.9655172413793105
7736333,3,B01EJ4MM62,7 episodes of fairly entertaining suspense that's just different enough to be entertaining are undone by a finale that takes the whole thing completely off the tracks.,1472515200,,167,5.222222222222222
7736334,5,B01EJ4MM62,"this was well done for a tv show i thought
it reminded me of a movie called inside  well the blood and gut scenes  did",1471478400,,118,3.68
8758918,5,B01EJ4MM62,I would write stuff like this years ago.. awesome work,1536192000,,54,4.5
8758919,1,B01EJ4MM62,"First, go to IMDB. Extremely different reviews. Second, this is a low budget thriller with the anticipated low budget side effects HOWEVER the lead actress is so, so, so terrible. She is Irish and literally every other sentence sounds 100% different. Majority of the time she sounds Irish and its like she isn't even trying at ALL. When she tries she sounds Australian and when she works very hard she sounds normal. I was googling her heritage halfway into episode one because listening to a main character speak crazy will make you crazy and entirely detracts from the show.",1526428800,,576,4.828282828282828
8758920,5,B01EJ4MM62,"I already had a strong feeling who the killer was, and I was correct. It's no Scream but I did enjoy every episode. Also loved how the series didn't just focus on Sarah. Yes, she's the final girl unlike the average final girl the killer wasn't targeting her friends. The people being target where people who knew her parents.",1518566400,,325,4.52542372881356
8758921,5,B01EJ4MM62,Great horror/suspense series.  Can't wait to purchase season 2.,1511740800,,63,6.0
8758922,5,B01EJ4MM62,I was intrigued by the series as it is a new series that offers a breath of fresh new show.  While it combines both something from 'Pretty little liars' and 'scream (the tv show not the movie)' it does put in new ideas into the mix to create something new.,1510358400,,256,4.12
8758923,5,B01EJ4MM62,This show is excellent! I love guessing whodunit every episode and finding out at the end. Great characters and story. The second season is even better!,1509753600,,152,4.884615384615385
8758924,3,B01EJ4MM62,It was okay. Not bad but not great. The concept was good but it wasn't executed that well. And the climax has clinched and done before. It almost made no sense.,1505952000,,160,4.193548387096774
8758925,3,B01EJ4MM62,Well done but hardly any likeable characters.  I've noticed that's a trend.,1505433600,,75,5.25
8758926,4,B01EJ4MM62,Very Good... can't wait for season 2.,1502496000,,37,4.428571428571429
8758927,5,B01EJ4MM62,"Very underrated show. I didn't really know what to expect going into it either. But it was really really amazing. The plot keeps you in it and when you think you know who the killer is, there's another twist. I'm usually very picky about the horror I watch and I loved this! I also did like that it was more like a mini series in that the season is wrapped up very well. There aren't any major cliff hangers making you feel like the lack of a season two would leave you disappointed and without answers (though there still should have been another season cause it was that good). I highly suggest it for all horror movie lovers!",1502409600,2,628,4.330508474576271
