8064432,1,B0009ORT42,"I have been doing Billy Blanks Tae Bo for years.  I bought 30 Power Rounds because it was on sale here on Amazon and it had pretty good reviews.  This was the most unorganized workout routine I have ever experienced.  It seemed as if it was totally made up on the spot.  There are 8 moves and you do 3 or 4 ""rounds"" of each move.  There is no set time for how long a ""round"" is, it appears to be totally random.  So it is very repetitive and boring.  You just get so sick of doing the same move over and over again.
There is a lot of starting and stopping.  Alot of ""walk it out"" and ""take it down"".  The background crew spends about 50% of the video hopping around and high-fiving each other and going ""Woo! Alright!""  This makes it difficult to get a good cardio workout out of this video.  I had to do a different Tae Bo DVD after this one just to feel like actually worked out that day.  Don't waste your money.",1299110400,8,915,4.050279329608938
8064433,5,B0009ORT42,"I'm at the advance level with Taebo, doing it on and off since 1999 and although this workout isn't an advanced workout, it's still a good workout. I believe that anyone that is a die hard Taebo fan, will enjoy this workout, no matter if they are a beginner or advanced.

I may be advanced, but I still work out to the beginner workouts. A person can never leave from the basics. The starting ground.

This workout is a 30 minute interval workout. It's stated that it contains thirty one minute workouts, but it's really 30 rounds. All the exercises aren't one minute. Some are longer than that.

I'm happy that Billy has done some interval workouts. Intervals are good to do. This workout has gotten my heart up. I can't wait to do it again.

In this workout, you will see some people using weighted gloves, weighted balls or nothing at all. You do what you feel comfortable with. Sometimes I use my weighted gloves or hands weights for Taebo workouts that don't require the resistance bands. It helps with the intensity.

In other for any workout to work for you, you have to work the workout.

I recommend this workout to Taebo fans that love doing Taebo period.",1291939200,6,1165,4.523809523809524
