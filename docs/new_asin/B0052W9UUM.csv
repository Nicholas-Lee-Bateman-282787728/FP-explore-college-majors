8454531,1,B0052W9UUM,"I purchased this video because it said ""Learning with Letters,"" and I mistakenly assumed it would go over the entire alphabet. Instead, this introduces and develops just three letters: A, I and J. Why these? Why ONLY these? Who knows.

I am asking for a refund. I was looking for a video that introduced all 26 letters in the alphabet.

That being said, it does a GREAT job with A, I and J. ;)",1373846400,5,393,4.297297297297297
8454532,3,B0052W9UUM,"Like the other reviewers, I bought this DVD thinking it was the whole alphabet. IT IS NOT! It is only the letters A, J, and I. As stated before me, it does say the whole alphabet at the end as the credits roll. And my son and I say the letters along with the TV and while it's not the whole video, it is entertaining.
If you understand all of that when buying it, you will be very pleased!

That said, my son LOVES this DVD. In fact, that's why I am here. I bought mine in a store, but am buying another one to replace our old, worn out one and thought that I would leave a quick review.",1335744000,2,587,3.8916666666666666
8454533,2,B0052W9UUM,"My son likes watching the episode about i. It is really disappointing that this video doesn't have clips for the whole alphabet. I'm missing old school sesame street. It is difficult finding good DVD's covering the entire alphabet, but it is worse when the title is misleading. However what I dislike the most is the mandatory previews at the beginning and if one can find their remote control pressing play brings one right back to the previews.",1319068800,3,446,4.805194805194805
