8382302,4,B002VKOA80,"The ideas in this video are quite useful for a novice like me. I have already built and begun using several of the tools from the video. Granted, a few of them are just different versions of the same idea, but even if there are only 35 or 40 actual ideas in the whole DVD, it's still well worth the money. And perhaps there are only 15 or 20 that a reasonably creative person would not have come up with on her own after a few weeks in the shop. Still, for me, it was well worth the money. I wished in a couple of instances he had shown a little more detail about how he constructed the tool or, in some cases, even how he uses it. But I built a few of them and just let them sit around until it became clear to me why I needed them. That worked out well, too! Overall, what I have gotten out of this DVD has made my just-starting-up luthier experience a lot more rewarding and fun, and for less than the price of my first chisel.",1271030400,11,930,3.978609625668449
