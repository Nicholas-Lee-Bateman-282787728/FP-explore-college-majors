8494677,5,B00687JZ28,"With popular culture shaming anyone who dares to point out that there are real differences between men and women, this is a great reminder that boys and girls are not only physically different, but that our biology affects how our brain functions and how we interact with others.

8494678,5,B00687JZ28,"Many would certainly say this is a dated episode. But, the warnings of where gender-studies stupidities were going to take our nation should have been heeded. But, the current sad state of GenXers was certainly prophesied in detailed in this Stossel's piece. Feminism is a fantasy and when what is a lie is believed to be true, horrific results occur on the believers. In this case, to believe that there are minimal differences between men and women when being male is fundamentally different than being female and it is for all to see, what future generation will stand afar off and lament what happened when the Emporer wore no clothes and then silenced those who pointed out the obvious. Stupid is as stupid does and this generation of GenX men who have this erotic attachment to feignly powerful and mean women are, in fact, stupid. How can a generation of men who refused to take the responsibilities inherent in being born male actually think that they can successfully lead a nation founded on the work of strong, responsible men? Thankfully, the following generations may actually realize this. Time will tell.",1439856000,2,1119,4.894736842105263
