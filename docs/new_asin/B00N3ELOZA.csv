8676032,3,B00N3ELOZA,not as good as the original...but if you are a music industry buff/head it makes it's case.,1433462400,,91,4.411764705882353
8676033,5,B00N3ELOZA,Excellent documentary!  I may be a bit biased because I know a couple of people in this film,1425686400,,92,4.111111111111111
8676034,3,B00N3ELOZA,"I really, really liked the first volume.  It dealt with Bandstand and payola and that type of thing.  Volume 1 stops with Bandstand.  Volume 2 starts with the 70's and 80's.  A lot of it was boring but I did learn a couple of things I didn't know.  Wasn't presented quite as good as the first Volume.  Almost like a sequel that was thrown together to cash in on the original volume.  It's still worthy though.  It does have interviews and does present some information that I didn't know.",1425081600,,488,4.404494382022472
8676035,4,B00N3ELOZA,"This follow-up to Director Sean Swords 2008 documentary on 1950s and 60s Play For Pay payola takes us into the 1980s with the rise of the independent record producer (The Indies) and spends much of its time on the FBI investigation of MCA Records. We hear from record company executives as well as the head of the US Dept of Justice Strike Force.

Swords gets interviews with artists  the legendary Charlie Gracie (hits in the 50s), Tommy James (60s pop star), Philly radio personality Michael Tearson (who does a nice job explaining what cut outs were in the LP vinyl days) and independent oldies record dealer Val Shively are interviewed.

You really need a roadmap to follow the investigation which later spends a lot of time on MCAs involvement in the movie industry.

There is national political involvement in this case since the head of MCA  Lew Wassermann  was a close friend (and major contributor for) President Ronald Reagan . Local Philly TV newscaster Tim Lake is brought in to summarize the Reagan Wasserman Connection.

I liked this 90 minute film because it told a story that I was not aware of  some of it occurring in the Philly area. But, its not as focused or music oriented as the first film Wages of Spin so I have to rate it four stars.
Swords is covering subjects no one else is and I hope he continues to make more films on the Politics of the recording industry.

My review is based on a advance screening copy and so I cant comment on any bonus features that may be on the commercial DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
