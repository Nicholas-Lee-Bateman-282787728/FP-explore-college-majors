8345473,1,B001V5K3U0,"I tried one of the recipes in this book and found that after I followed the directions to a ""T"", I had to ""doctor it up"" a lot to make it palatable.  Maybe it's not fair to rate the whole book on just one recipe, but I had to assume that if one recipe tastes that bad, then the others probably weren't worth the time or expense to make.  I had better luck just going on line to find Thai recipes that were very good.",1320969600,,416,3.8823529411764706

I'm not a great cook AT ALL but these recipes are great and the video makes them really easy to do.

8345477,5,B001V5K3U0,"I was so happy to find this helpful video!  I have of course eaten Thai food in restaurants for many years and love the varied food options Thai cuisine offers, but I always felt that mastering the techniques in my own kitchen would be too difficult.  I was wrong!  The presenter is a native of Thailand and I was cooking like a pro after only a few lessons from the video.  The spring rolls are by far my favorite!  They are not nearly as hard to make as I thought.  And the curry recipe is fantastic!  Anyone can learn to cook delicious, healthy meals from this video.  I highly recommend it for anyone aspiring to cook up some Asian specialties!",1275868800,3,648,4.341666666666667
