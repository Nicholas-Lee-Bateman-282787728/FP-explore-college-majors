2073695,3,B0002B15KG,"My two daughters (1-1/2 and 2-1/2) love this movie.  They will sit still to watch the whole thing.  Therefore, I can recommend it for toddler entertainment.  However, the adults may want to leave the room....  It simply grates on your nerves after the first viewing -- especially the voice casting for Custard.  The voice is a horrible match to the cute pink kitty pictured.  And honestly, before this video, I didn't realize that a voice actor could be such a BAD actor!!!  It is agony to listen to the too-hard voice deliver lines in such flat dreary tones....",1153785600,2,562,4.673469387755102
2073696,5,B0002B15KG,"I purchased this without having viewed it first based on favorable reviews by others.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is a very cute story and keeps the attention of both my 3 year old daughter, and surprisingly, my 4 1/2 year old son.  I specifically bought Best Pets Yet because I thought the animals would appeal to both boys and girls and it does.  This is currently one of my daughter's top 3 favorite videos (along with Barbie Nutcracker and Cinderella).",1151452800,,456,4.6625
2073697,5,B0002B15KG,"This is the second SS DVD our granddaughter has. She has been picking this one to watch when she is at our house. She seems to find Pupcake's howling hilarious and always laughs at that part of the show. As with the other SS DVD she has,the dialogue is somewhat sugary sweet and can be annoying to an adult at times,but is bearable. We'll probably get her a few more SS DVD's for Christmas,since she does enjoy watching them.",1127001600,6,425,4.3924050632911396
2073698,4,B0002B15KG,"I found this DVD to be so cute, just like the other ones. It was great meeting all the different pets in strawberryland! My only ""pet peeve"" is that Blueberry Muffin and her pet mouse Cheesecake were not in the episode at all! They are one of my favorite character duos. That was the only real let down, other than that I would have given it 5 stars. All the pets rule!

P.S- Custards whiny, selfish, spoiled attitude kind of got on my nerves in the first episode.",1112745600,6,464,4.2727272727272725
2073699,5,B0002B15KG,She watches it so much that my husband and I find our self's singing the songs. If your children love music then they will love this movie or any of the other Strawberry Shortcake movies. It's funny to listen to some of the corky sayings they come up with too...,1110240000,3,262,4.26
2073700,5,B0002B15KG,"I've been very impressed by the Strawberry Shortcake movies, and this one is not exception.  They don't include violence or the characters treating each other badly.  They're very positive and teach good lessons.  My daughter's favorite part about them are songs.  She loves to sing along.",1105920000,3,289,5.217391304347826
2073701,5,B0002B15KG,"I bought this for my daughter (4 yrs.) for Christmas.  She and my son (2 yrs) love to watch it.  And it is a fairly enjoyable video for adults to watch as well (not like many others--i.e. barney, boobah, etc.).  This is a video worth buying for any little girl.",1105488000,2,261,4.18
2073702,5,B0002B15KG,"I was ""berry"" lucky to be able to see an advance screening of this DVD at the second Strawberry Shortcake Convention in Cleveland. It was an unfinished copy, missing a lot of the sound effects that will be present in the final copy. However, it gave us a look at the new title sequence, as well as a taste of the new format for these DVDs. They are now going to be divided into two 22-minute episodes, instead of one longer one.
This is, in my opinion, the best of all the Strawberry Shortcake DVDs to date. The stories are cute and entertaining, and the shorter episode format keeps the attention span a little better. The first episode, while not entierly consistent with the first four DVDs, explains how Strawberry gets Pupcake. The second is a story very obviously inspired by the 1980s Pets On Parade Strawberry Shortcake cartoon. (In fact, the same person from American Greetings worked on both stories, another tidbit learned at the Convention.) This one is great not only because it features the cartoon debuts of all the pets belonging to Strawberry's friends (including Apple Ducklin' and Shoofly Frog, who have yet to appear in toy form) but it introduces a brand new character, Peppermint Fizz, and her pet lizard Cola Chameleon.
In the context in which I saw this cartoon, I was able to get the reactions of both intended audiences - children and collectors. The children loved it; they sang along with the theme song and their eyes stayed firmly fixed on the screen. As for the collectors, it's quite fun to hear gasps of joy from grown people when their favourite pet appears onscreen for the first time. ;-)
If Strawberry Shortcake appeals to you or your children, this DVD will definitely NOT disappoint.",1089849600,15,1722,4.724252491694352

8025415,4,B0002B15KG,"My daughter, who is 3, likes this one becasue of all the pets. She, and I, especially like Pupcake, who chases his tail with such abandon that he becomes a whirlwind - hysterical. I do not like Peppermint Fizz, with her sneaky cheating ways, but she realizes she was wrong at the end. She is my least favorite character whenever she appears. The world has many Peppermint Fizzes, but it doesn't mean I have to like to watch them do their dirty stuff.",1174694400,2,450,4.433734939759036

8025417,5,B0002B15KG,"""Best Pets Yet"" is a DVD featuring two berry good ""Strawberry Shortcake"" stories. This fun series contains animation that is pleasing on the eyes, fun songs, and enjoyable plots and characters.

The fun starts with ""Here Comes Pupcake."" For the longest time, Strawberry has had only one pet --- a cat named Custard. Well, that is, if any cat can ever truly be called a ""pet."" Custard is excited because her very own special day with Strawberry is coming up. But then, both of them hear the howling of a dog. He's lost and alone and Strawberry takes him and decides to name him Pupcake. At first, Custard can't stand him. He howls all the time and seems to take up all of Strawberry's attention. Will Custard ever come to like Pupcake, at least maybe a little?

In the second story, ""Peppermint's Pet Peeve,"" a rarely-seen character called Peppermint Fizz is jealous at how the other characters regard their pets, but pay her or her pet, a lizard, little attention. She decides to hold a competition to find the ""Best Pet Yet."" The kids end up reluctantly agreeing, but then Peppermint Fizz gets up to mean tricks.

DVD includes close-captioning and features a bonus music video, a friends game and a tour of places.",1168214400,,1215,4.668224299065421
