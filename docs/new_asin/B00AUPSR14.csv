5510531,5,B00AUPSR14,I saw both of these movies when they first came out and I was so pleased to find both of them in DVD! I would Highly Recommend both of them to anyone that enjoy the older Horror movies that had a plot and story behind them! Highly Recommend to anyone that Love Quality movies without all the blood and guts!,1364688000,,307,4.133333333333334
5510532,5,B00AUPSR14,"I picked up this set from wal-mart for $5.00. I mainly got this to replace my ""Happy Birthday To Me"" 2009 DVD release with original score. Almost didn't get this set, because it has the artwork from the 2004 disc set with cheezy disco score replacing the original score. I thought it would not have the original theatrical score, but it absolutely does. The blu-ray transfer is much nicer than even the 2009 DVD edition, and having When A Stranger Calls is a nice bonus as well. These do have captions which is a must for me as well. Great set all around. Just wish it had the original artwork for Happy Birthday To Me.",1363219200,21,619,4.391304347826087
5510533,5,B00AUPSR14,"Both of these movies were released by columbia in 1979 and 1980 respectively. And they look fantastic! Columbia kept great prints of these two because they are not filled with lines and specks! That's saying alot for two vintage films this old! both films played at theatres accross the country and were not drive in superlow budget flicks at all. These were offerings from a major studio during that era. Many much bigger hit movies from this era don't look as good as these two do on this blu ray. Both movies did pretty well at the boxoffice and they both influenced movies that came after them, including scream and other slasher flicks. There are fine actors in these movies too , because like I said these were big studio affairs and not made by some small company.  Glenn ford , charles durning and carol kane are among the a listers in these efforts. Horror fans should be grateful that we get these two movies in such fine shape here. It could have easily been a disaster with scratched up prints. Instead we get two good horror movies from columbia studios and they just shine here.",1358467200,19,1092,4.571428571428571
5510534,4,B00AUPSR14,"First off, this title is actually available now at Wal-mart.  Anyway, on to the review.

I watched both films today and I must say the transfer is really good for 2 movies that are over 30 years old. They are both on 1 disc btw. I have never seen either movie.

Now I've seen the remake of When A Stranger Calls and it is a much better paced film imo. They chose to keep the killer more of a mystery and kept the story around the single night of babysitting. The original covers that night in the first 30 minutes of the movie, then we are carried 7 years in the future for a lot of unneeded exposition. The last 10 minutes truly save the picture imo.

I actually enjoyed Happy Birthday To Me quite well. The acting is really bad, I must say, but the multiple twists (yes, multiple) really keep you on your toes. The Scream franchise really owes a debt to this film. I was reading up on the history of the home video release, and fans will be happy to know that the ORIGINAL SCORE IS IN TACT FOR THIS BD RELEASE.

Definitely a worthy buy for any slasher horror fan.",1358294400,21,1065,4.175609756097561

5510536,5,B00AUPSR14,I first saw 'When a stranger calls' on HBO back in the '80s. Such a thriller. One of my favorite scary movies.,1434326400,,110,4.045454545454546
5510537,4,B00AUPSR14,Happy birthday to me was a great suspenseful movie.  When a Stranger Call was OK--was a little flat in the middle.,1431561600,,114,4.428571428571429
5510538,4,B00AUPSR14,"Two classic thriller chillers on one disc. I already had When A Stranger Calls and bought this purely to have the original spooky music soundtrack version of Happy Birthday To Me as the DVD version tried to make it appeal to a younger audience by taking away the scary music and in doing so killed off half the suspense. Gee, some movie companies have a lot to answer for with messing around with original soundtracks and I'm sure I'm not alone in that thought.",1431043200,,461,4.5

5510546,5,B00AUPSR14,This movie am a  is a  great horror/suspense thri buller edge of your seat because it is so realistic and if you have ever babysat before; it could have been you. I babysat a lot in my younger years so I put myself in the actress's role. I have collected about 400 movies but this still remains one of my favorites.,1416182400,,315,4.147540983606557
5510547,5,B00AUPSR14,"I was seeking ""Happy Birthday to Me"" and found this double feature as a better value.  The movies are presented in widescreen and are fresh,  sharp images.  ""Happy Birthday to Me"" starring Melissa Sue Anderson (from Little House on the Prarie fame) remained my favorite with some good story twists.  Not an excellent movie but a good throwback to yesteryear.  ""When a Stranger Calls"" was overall good but the story did become slow in the middle.  I had not seem this version before.... only sequels/remakes.",1414972800,,507,4.905882352941177
5510548,5,B00AUPSR14,"Both movies were good. The second time I saw When a Stranger Calls, I enjoyed it even more. Carol Kane from Taxi is in it. And Happy Birthday to Me has Melissa Sue Anderson ( Mary from Little House on the Prairie ) in it. Which , As far as I know , Is the only horror film she did.",1405123200,,281,3.7
5510549,2,B00AUPSR14,"I love these two movies, but Double Feature stuffs never have the artistic value that I always treasure . If the bluray is released alone , the front cover and poster design is simply truth to it's own, that's what a movie fanatic truly wants. Really  hate to see so many great movies  published directly into  Double Feature because the producer company fear that publishing them alone won't gain profit.
I , myself , the biggest fan of HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME will be so happy to see this movie be released in it's bluray edition, I really would like to own it just to itself, not a Double Feature .
The other good movies such as KILLING ME SOFTLY and THE HOT SPOT will be a great delight if they could  release individually in bluray , not Double Feature which is now on the market .",1403222400,,783,4.3061224489795915
5510550,3,B00AUPSR14,"It's great to finally have ""When a Stranger Calls"" on Blu-Ray.  This would have been a better double feature if it had included the sequel to this film ""When a Stranger Calls Back"" instead of ""Happy Birthday To Me"".  Hence the 3 star rating.",1395964800,3,241,4.454545454545454
5510551,5,B00AUPSR14,"There are some great underated films out there.  And two of these Are the Original When a Stranger Calls & Happy Birthday to Me.  And Fortunately, Mill Creek Entertainment has put them both on Blu-Ray as a Double Pack.
  When a Stranger Calls plays on the old Urbam Myth concerning babysitters & the phone.  It stars a young Carol Kane as the babysitter who is terrorized by a crazed murderous psychopath.  Years later the psychopath escapes form the mental institution only to seek solice in trying to be accepted  by society while a grown babysitter with her own family now is scared into thinking he may be after her family now.
  Happy Birthday to me was very well known to be one of the most schizophrenic of horror/slasher films with a decent soundtrack.  It stars the Actress who played Little House on the Prarie's older Ingalls sister.
  Both of these are GREAT to watch",1393718400,,879,4.636363636363637

5510555,5,B00AUPSR14,I saw this many years ago with my friend - I gave it to her as a xmas gift.  I will not ever watch this movie again.  it was a very spooky movie and I can still remember some of those seens 30 years later.,1389139200,,205,3.533333333333333

5510558,5,B00AUPSR14,All the other reviews are correct it is a great print of both films and an amazing deal! Totally worth it!,1378166400,,106,4.095238095238095
5510559,3,B00AUPSR14,"When a Stranger Calls is a classic movie that scars the pants off you.  But those who haven't seen the original, the only good parts are the beginning and the end.  The whole middle is extremely boring and there is nothing really good about it nor has really anything to do with how the beginning or ending was.",1377043200,,311,4.344827586206897
5510560,3,B00AUPSR14,"As with the DVD of this movie, the poignant scene between John Clifford and Tracy having a personal talk was deleted from this movie. Why would this be done on a blu-ray with plenty of room even with two movies on it? It didn't contain any profanity or anything that would have been offensive. You'd think now that the great Charles Durning has passed away his movie legacy would be treated better.",1376956800,3,398,4.541666666666667
5510561,4,B00AUPSR14,"This isn't the first Mill Creek BD I've purchased, and so far either I've been lucky or they really do care about what they do (take notes, Echo Bridge).  The only place this seems like a budget disc is in the cover art, which leaves a little to be desired; the movies themselves look and sound very good ('When a Stranger Calls' especially).  No attempts to smear out the film grain or otherwise mess with these older, low-budget productions--they're simply good prints, very well transferred.  Both movies share one disc, but don't suffer from heavy compression or other signs of cost-cutting.  That you can get this kind of quality for about $3 a movie is unbelievable!

The soundtracks are 5.1 (for 'Happy Birthday to Me') and 2.0 (for 'When a Stranger Calls').  Both of these movies were originally mono if I'm not mistaken.  These stereo/surround mixes sound kind of like they went back to the stereo recordings of the music, and just added them to the mono dialogue/effects of the movies.  I'm not complaining; the levels are spot on and these aren't the kinds of mixes where the clearer-sounding music drowns everything else out.

And yes, 'Happy Birthday to Me' is presented with the original score, NOT the apparent temp track that ended up on Sony's earlier DVD.  Yay!",1373587200,11,1279,4.799086757990867
5510562,5,B00AUPSR14,"I originally saw When a Stranger Calls in a movie theater when it first came out. I had forgotten what a classy suspense movie this is. I am not an expert in Blu-ray transfers but from what I observe this is very good for a vintage movie. The colors are rich and detail is sharp. It looks excellent, take my word for it. This also has a really superb music score by Dana Kaproff that has inspired me to seek out a copy of the soundtrack. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror/suspense type movies.
I had not seen Happy Birthday to Me, but again it looks to be a fine transfer. This one has a bit more blood in it than When a Stranger Calls, but still is another worthy addition to the horror thriller genre. And again, a very good music score which I don't believe has been released in any form. I understand that earlier video releases of this movie used a different but unpopular music score. There is also a nice rendition of the song ""Happy Birthday to Me"" sung at the end of the movie (during the credits) by Syreeta.
I recommend both of these movies and especially at the very reasonable price at which they are available.",1367798400,3,1140,4.306976744186047
5510563,3,B00AUPSR14,"These are 2 great movies at a great buy. Got them at the big box store, but neither will play widescreen on ANY tv or DVD player in my home. I've adjusted the settings on my players and TV's to try and get the widescreen, but it just won't play that way.",1365984000,,254,3.9038461538461537
5510564,4,B00AUPSR14,"For those of you who enjoy early 80s horror/thriller and/or collect these types of films, this one is for you!  Two films for a very low price!  Happy Birthday to Me - 80s slasher film, and  When a Stranger Calls - Suspense/Thriller/Horror.  The Video quality for 20+ year films is outstanding!  Both these films were not considered big budget films, so to have a movie this old with spectacular video quality is a plus.  While both films story-line's have been copied over and over again, its really a great deal for the price!  The only reason and is a very big reason I did not give it 5 stars is because its a great price - there are NO EXTRAS. Not even a trailer!  Common now, you can find one on Youtube, its not like the distributors would have to find it or anything!  All in all, for barely $10 dollars you get two ""decent"" films.",1364860800,3,839,4.326923076923077

8558006,4,B00AUPSR14,"These are two horror classics from the turn of the 80's that have been copied and spoofed. Watching these films will help someone understand the genius of say a movie like ""Student Bodies."" The Birthday film had passable restoration and the Stranger one could have used some work, but was watchable, just not 1080 quality.

Both films have a US ""R"" rating. They were created before the PG-13 rating was used and today both would have the lower PG-13 rating. There is little to no swearing, minimum blood and gore, no sex, and minor male butt nudity.

What is really nice about this Blu-Ray set is that apparently they over produced it so the price is cheap.",1444521600,,657,4.6068376068376065
