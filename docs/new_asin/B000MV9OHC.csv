Both films were at one time concidered classics, and great 'horror' triumphs. This is true to an extent. Where today this both seem very, well...bad, in the 1940's these were cutting edge. Most of the films are taken from national geographic videos of animals fighting in an attempt to use said animal as a monster. This is a technique that has been perfected over time, but these two films laid the foundation for modern films like Abyss and Jaws.

For that I give these films two stars. I have awarded to more stars to the films as while they have become cult classics, they hardly deserve to be. The story lines in both jump around and are at times hard to follow, which is not what should happen in a horror film.

Bowanga, and Devil Monster may have been the for fathers of a specific genre of horror film they hardly are worth a look today.",1215043200,2,881,4.49375
