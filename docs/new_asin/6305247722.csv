7886795,4,6305247722,"THE ENIGMA OF THE SWASTIKA (1991)
directed by Dave Flitton
approx. 48 minutes

This is an excellent documentary about how the swastika became the preferred logo of the National Socialist regime in Germany.  According to the end credits, the movie was made in 1991.  One minor complaint I have is that the sound briefly cuts out on my DVD around the 15 minute mark.

Many people already know that the swastika was used by other cultures before the 1930s.  This documentary states that the first publication to feature the symbol in Germany was from a group founded by Madam Blavatsky, the figurehead of the Theosophy movement.  Earlier, Blavatsky wrote a book titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Doctrine/dp/0835602389/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret Doctrine</a>&nbsp;which features such quaint concepts as ""root races"" and the mysterious power of ancient symbols.  She believed that the swastika was the most powerful of all these symbols, and in fact the Theosophical Society's logo still retains the swastika to this day.

The swastika isn't the only esoteric symbol that the National Socialists used, and Germany was home to several groups interested in pre-Christian spirituality long before the Third Reich.  Guido von List was a turn of the century occultist who believed in a ""Germanic religion"" which incorporated pagan concepts from Teutonic mythology, including the worship of Wotan (Odin).  List wrote a book titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-the-Runes/dp/0892812079/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of the Runes</a>&nbsp;which popularized the study of the Runic alphabet as a way to get in touch with the metaphysical history of Germany.  The Hitler Youth, Ministry of Agriculture and the SS all incorporated runes into their iconography.  This documentary even shows a photograph of an SS cemetery, with runes at the head of each grave!

List later used Blavatsky's terminology as a way to describe his visions of Germanic religion.  He believed that there would be a utopian renewal for followers of his philosophy.  For this group he appropriated ""aryan"", part of one of Blavatsky's root races.  She believed that aryans were more spiritually and intellectually evolved than other groups.  The symbol she associated with the aryans was the swastika.

The first World War was supposed to be the aryans' big moment.  Some of the soldiers even wore swastikas during combat.  Instead, they wound up embarrassed and compromised under the Versailles Treaty.  The war's aftermath produced the Weimar Republic which was rife with all stripes of extremists trying to capitalize on the chaos.  One such group was the aristocratic Thule Society, a racial mystic group with anti-jewish beliefs.  Group members were required to demonstrate ""pure aryan lineage"".  This pagan group sponsored a newly formed political organization called the German Worker's Party.  The group later changed it's name to the National Socialist German Worker's Party.  Once the party came to power, a research team travelled to Tibet, just as the occultist Madame Blavatsky had many years before.

7886797,4,6305247722,"This dvd was very interesting in explaining the eastern roots and western uses of the Schwastika, the Sieg, and other esoteric symbols.  Walking into a Presbyterian Church close to my home I was VERY surprised to see on the left wall hanging a banner with a cross and there was a schwastika on a cloth banner above the cross, but it was crossed out.  I was surprised to learn that the Schwastika was used all over the world before Hitler adopted the eastern Buddhist symbol of good luck and of creation and turned it into a symbol of hate.  Its cheap and very informative.",1058918400,9,572,4.480769230769231
7886798,2,6305247722,"Hitler and the occult... a nonexistent collaboration invented by opportunistic amateurs. Consult Hitler's own words, where he slammed the occult as ""Jewish and bolshevik.""
This is a difficult video to review because its premise is flawed from the get go: there is no occult associated with Hitler and there never was. The people chosen to be interviewed in this unintentionally amusing documentary are charletans of the first order. None are respected, noted or competent historians, they are pop writers who believe in errant nonsense. What types of nonsense, you ask? I shall tell you: they believe that when Hitler was a young man living in Vienna, he stumbled upon a spear located in a local museum. The spear infused the young artist with mythical and evil ""powers."" Yeah, right... and I was abucted yesterday by Martians and taken to outer space.
Only the most gullible cretins could believe anything in this childish video. Errors of the most fundamental nature abound: Hitler did not emigrate to Munich in 1912, but in 1913; Dietrich Eckart did not die in 1945, Hitler did not meet Eva Braun in 1933... the list is endless. As a laugh this might be useful, as history it is unreliable and puerile in the extreme.",1057968000,5,1220,4.898550724637682
7886799,3,6305247722,"What a strange three volume set. All you ever wanted to know about Nazi ideology in three hour long episodes. The documentary is reasonably non-judgemental (although the fact that they gassed 6 million jews is not glossed over), rather it is a look back in history to try and find reasons for the Hitler's ""different"" perspective on Germans, Jews and the whole of world history. There is a large amount of documentary footage which I hadn't seen before, and I've seen a fair amount of footage from the inter war years.
And even if you you hate the thing, ...Can't argue about the price, at least.",986860800,6,596,4.632075471698113
