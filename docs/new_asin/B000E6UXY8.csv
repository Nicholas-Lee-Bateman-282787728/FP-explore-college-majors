2966968,5,B000E6UXY8,"In France, Htel du Nord is generally regarded as essential viewing for fans of classic film, an undeniable piece of pre-WWII art from French cinema's master-director Marcel Carn (also responsible for Children of Paradise and Le jour se lve, among other great films). Unlike some of his other well-known pictures, Htel du Nord was not written by his frequent collaborator, Jacques Prvert, but, rather, by Henri Jeanson. Perhaps this is why Htel du Nord is less well-known outside of its home country. But, even without Prvert contributing his inimitable dialogue, the film is a feast for the eyes and ears, and deserves to be ranked alongside those more famous works.

The action mostly takes place at the title hotel, situated on the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. Top-billed young lovers Annabella and Jean-Pierre Aumont come to the hotel to fulfill a secret ""suicide pact"" that goes awry, sending poor Annabella to the hospital and Jean-Pierre, his sanpaku eyes hauntingly sad, on the run. When she recovers, Annabella returns to the hotel to work, and the lives of all its inhabitants intersect as the various stories and relationships are explored. Several other prominent characters who populate this magnificent film include Paulette Dubost (of Rules of the Game fame) as Ginette and Bernard Blier as Prosper.

Most famously (and most memorably), the hotel is home to Louis Jouvet's world-weary pimp M. Edmond and Arletty's charismatic prostitute Raymonde, with her unmistakable ""gouaille"" accent. In one of French cinema's most iconic exchanges of dialogue, Jouvet and Arletty, on a bridge crossing the Canal, discuss a need for a change of ""atmosphre, atmoshre."" The line is so oft-quoted and well-known in France that it is now as much a part of French popular culture as ""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn"" and ""I have a feeling we're not in Kansas any more"" are here in the States. I have even heard some claim that it the most famous line in the history of French film.

Complimenting the superb script, acting and direction are the production values, which are of the highest order. The phenomenal set, a meticulously detailed recreation of a real part of Paris, makes for a beautiful canvas on which to tell the stories. (I recently had the good fortune to visit the actual Canal Saint-Martin, where, over 70 years later, things have changed so little. In fact, a ""Htel du Nord"" still stands on the spot, its faade immediately identifiable. There is also a caf near by called ""Atmosphre"" and another called ""Garance"" in reference to Arletty's signature role in Carn's Children of Paradise.)

The cinematography, with Carn's camera effortlessly gliding around the set, voyeuristically investigates every nook and cranny of the lives of the characters and explores the set's magnificence and attention to detail to perfection. The costumes and music also contribute to the legendary ""atmosphre"" of this film.

Htel du Nord bears every hallmark of the classic studio style, from Annabella's perfect hair and makeup (even near death, after a grueling blood transfusion in the hospital) to the obvious set-bound nature of the entire production (which is embraced rather than disguised). Somehow, these characteristics make Htel du Nord all-the-more endearing. It is, in turn, charming, moving and haunting. And unforgettable.

Unfortunately, the film is pretty hard to find in the States. It has been released on VHS and DVD in France, the U.K. and other European countries, but no such luck for us. We American fans will just have to keep our fingers crossed that Criterion will soon include the film in their collection. If you get the chance to see this film, whether in a repertory theater, while overseas or perhaps on television, you ought to jump at it. It truly is an indelible example of the poetic realsim that is unique to French films of this era.",1253750400,10,3868,5.0359375

8222696,3,B000E6UXY8,A classic as we were told on a recent boat trip as we passed the Hotel on Canal St. Martin. A very unusual story but captivating and oozing with atmosphere.,1390953600,,156,4.233333333333333
8222697,4,B000E6UXY8,"Camus, if I remember correctly, wrote a story in which a prisoner of the Germans, a member of the Resistance, makes up what he thinks is misleading information about where his compatriots are hiding; however, unbeknownst to him, the Resistance members are actually hiding where he says, and they are captured despite his attempt to shield them and mislead the Germans. In Existentialism there is actually no free will, (as there is no free will in Communism where everyone and everything is determined by class logic). Similarly, the logic of Existentialism demands predestination, but this was unfashionable and so unthinkable at the time. Therefore the Existentialists conceived of predestination as coinciding with what appears to be free will. In this movie the destinies of the characters work out completely differently from their intentions and expectations but in ways which suggest they were predestined despite everyone's attempts to make their own decisions and fulfill their desires. Nothing happens the way in which the personas propose to act. Somewhat forced and dated, but intriguing as a glimpse into the mind of the times and place. More sophisticated than Fritz Lang's 1921 film ""Destiny"" or ""Der Muede Tod"" (Weary Death) but doubtless inspired by it. And an example of Existentialist thought. A classic film.",1382227200,3,1328,5.298578199052133
8222698,5,B000E6UXY8,"This film holds up very well and especially as it reveals scenes of a ""neighborhood"" in Paris that is very pittoresque and gives the viewers a ""taste"" of community ""a la francaise""  where everyone in the story knows all the characters and their stories and actually cares!  They  act to console, aid and support each other.  Performances are exquisite and very, very ""from the theatre"", as most of the actors were.  Historically, the film is very important as it is France just before the second world war and the black and white images are works of art.",1378252800,2,554,4.670103092783505
8222699,5,B000E6UXY8,"This is an excellent French classic from the 1930s.  The opening scene when the camera pans the buildings fronting a canal in Paris, going under a bridge, to stop at the Hotel du Nord, is fantastic.  It reminded me of Robert Altman's The Player with its long shot (no camera break) of a Hollywood studio.

Most French people I've talked to recognize the following quote.  ""Atmosphre?  Atmosphre?  Est-ce que j'ai une gueuele d'atmosphre?""  The stress in the first two words is on ""MO"" the second syllable.  This is spoken by the actress Arletty in Hotel du Nord.

The movie centers around the Hotel du Nord, especially around two couples.  One couple is a thief and his prostitute girlfriend (played by Arletty).  The other couple is a young man and woman who check into the hotel to commit suicide, but botch it.  The young man goes to jail while the young woman goes to work at the hotel after leaving the hospital.  The thief falls in love with her.

There's other side stories involving others who live or work at the hotel.

I highly recommend this film",1346371200,2,1058,4.612903225806452
8222700,4,B000E6UXY8,"Interesting 30's French movie set in Hotel du Nord on Canal St Martin in Paris. The movie contains a few scenes of the neighborhood but follows the owners, staff and patrons as they deal with bungled suicide/murder of young couple.

8222701,5,B000E6UXY8,"Sandwiched between Quai des Brumes and Le Jour Se Leve and with a plot beginning and ending with acts of suicide, Hotel Du Nord is in many ways the lightest of Marcel Carne's classic poetic realist movies - at least some characters get a happy ending here. Although a quite lavish production, this is no Grand Hotel exercise in glamour, following instead the thwarted lives and loves of the occupants of a small hotel by the side of Paris' Canal Saint-Martin (in reality built on the studio backlot). At times it almost feels like a Jean Renoir film, never judging its characters but allowing them the occasional moments of hope that make their lives worth living.

The film does at times feel a little unbalanced by the shift of emphasis from the would-be doomed lovers to Arletty's streetwalker and even more by Louis Jouvert's pimp who disastrously briefly discovers his true self (a performance compelling and powerful enough to make you regret the fact that Jouvert chose to make so few films), while co-writer Henri Jeansen's dislike of Jean Pierre Aumont does mean he's too busy describing himself as a piece of merde to display his usual screen charisma, yet the film is such a marvellous match of style and content that you willing go along with the film's ebb and flow. With Louis N&eacute;e and Armand Thirard's gliding camerawork complimenting Alexandre Trauner's truly amazing set while Maurice Jaubert effectively reuses part of his score that had been dropped from the reissue prints of L'Atalante on the soundtrack, it's practically a masterclass in pre-war French cinema. And the ending - with one character announcing the end of the Hotel Du Nord and the coming Jour se Leve - is a neat touch that feels just right rather than just showing off.

Soda's UK PAL DVD is highly recommended, offering a good 18-minute introduction by Paul Ryan and a beautiful print that looks like the film was made only yesterday.",1284076800,4,1928,4.857142857142857

This pact goes awry and opens up to us the lives of other inhabitants. Especially Arletty, her tongue like a twist of lemon, who rooms with Louis Jouvet, of several identities. I'll just mention that Francois Perier has a minor role as a subtly revealed gay. Marcel Carne's direction keeps us believing,and when the last shot is fired at film's end we are satisfied that a man can make his own decision to pay up.",1254268800,3,580,4.533333333333333
