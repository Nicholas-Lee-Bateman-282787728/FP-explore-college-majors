8377290,3,B002PT03VK,"""Animal X: Natural Mystery Unit"" is a series of documentaries of the usual monster-ghost type. And yes, they might scare your grandkids! Especially the ""mission controller"" Bill Kerr, who frankly scares me too, but perhaps for different reasons. Where on earth did they find this absurd, stereotypical character? The pseudo-dramatic music ads to the impression that we are far from Science Channel, LOL.

In this episode, the two young investigators Daniel and Natalie (both with distinctly non-American accents) roam the United States in pursuit of reptilian humanoids or reptoids, dropping leading questions to the eye-witnesses as they go along. The Bishopville, South Carolina ""Lizard Man"" is featured, and so are alien abductees, fringe ufologist John Rhodes of the Reptoid Research Center, and several token sceptics. Admittedly, the sceptics get more time than usual to explain their position. A Harvard psychiatrist even gets to lecture on the scientific method, reaching the conclusion that...well, reptoids from another planet aren't abducting our hard-working citizens. Thank you.

But what about Lizard Man in Bishopville? Well...?  My explanation is that Bigfoot has learned how to don a green, reptilian suit, being stung by all the conventional BFRO reports. ""It's just a North American ape"". Would you accept a CV like that? I think not. Somebody somewhere is trying to send us a message! To quote Sherlock Holmes: ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true"". Precisely. :P

In fact, Daniel and Natalie reach the same conclusion (almost). They believe that Lizard Man is a misidentified Bigfoot overgrown with green algae... (I wonder how they will explain away Mothman in the next episode? Mothmen, after all, can fly!)

There, this entertaining (after a fashion) TV show ends. I'm not sure how to rate this, but since it made me a bit more upbeat, I suppose I have to give it three stars.",1360800000,,1956,5.276527331189711
8377291,3,B002PT03VK,"I honestly do not know what to make of this DVD.  When ""Animal X"" was on Animal Planet a few years ago, I tried to save as many episodes as I could, but missed recording this episode, which I thought was one of their best.  A few weeks ago, I did a random search for ""Animal X"" and noticed that individual episodes on DVD were available for purchase.  What follows is a two part review: first part on the episode and second on the quality of the DVD itself.

THE EPISODE:
""Reptilian Creatures.""  The focus of the episode is an attempt to take seriously and investigate accounts of reptilian humanoids, a.k.a. ""Reptoids.""  These creatures are supposedly upright-walking humanoids who are obviously reptiles of some sort.  The investigation begins in Bishopville, SC, where reports of the famed ""Lizardman"" began in the 1980's.  The investigation then shifts to exploring the possibility that these animals exist, but the question is posited: how can they, when there is absolutely no evidence of animals of this type in the fossil record?  This leads to a shift in investigating which brings in the possibility that these Reptoids are not natives of Earth at all... .  Natalie and Daniel try their best in this episode (helped, of course, by the overbearing Bill ""My Darlings"" Kerr), but ultimately, just do not do their homework.  They completely miss investigating reports of swamp-beasts that are documented from all over the South; many of which described as Lizard-things.  A better conclusion could have been reached by consulting Keel's ""Creatures Out of Time and Space"" rather than interviewing a rather vapid British Fortean writer who obviously knows nothing about the subject.  Also, too much time was wasted interviewing UFO contactees who have little to add to the investigation.

THE DVD:
In all honesty, when this DVD arrived from Amazon, I thought it was a bootleg and am still not convinced that it is not a bootleg.  The DVD itself is in a slim case and came shrink-wrapped in a material that looked like cling-wrap.  The front of the color sleeve looks good, but the back is another indication that this is a bootleg: a poorly reproduced episode summary that looks like a cheap color printer print-out.  The printout on the back of this disc was even worse than the one on the ""Murderer or Monster"" DVD: completely unintelligible.  The disc itself has a nice ""Animal X"" color print glued on one side, but the back of the disc is clearly a DVR: purple in color, just like the ones you can get at a store.  However, the reproduction on this DVD is excellent: excellent color, sound and picture quality.  The picture is widescreen and there are no chapters or closed captioning; another indication that this is a bootleg.

In conclusion, it's my opinion that this dvd was worth the money, even if it is inexplicably five dollars more expensive than other episodes.  This episode was very good and is impossible to find now.  For fans or inquisitive scholars of reptoids or cryptids, I'd recommend this episode.  However, the DVD itself is probably a bootleg, so I cannot give it the full four stars.",1257984000,,3114,4.821092278719397
