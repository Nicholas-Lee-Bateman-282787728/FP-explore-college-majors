8350488,5,B0024FAG8K,"...it's a 1965 Sherlock Holmes movie starring John Neville as Holmes. I saw it once on cable and am hoping this is that movie. Interestingly, it is a Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper story, made 14 years before the better known ""Murder by Decree."" Trivia: actor Frank Finlay plays Inspector Lestrade in both movies, the portly Robert Morley is Mycroft Holmes, and a very young Judi Dench makes an appearance, long before she became ""M.""

With very little information to go on, not even an image or a firm release date as of this writing, let's hope this is the DVD release of this little known but very good Sherlock Holmes movie.",1246752000,35,624,4.571428571428571
8350489,3,B0024FAG8K,"A realy good Sherlock Holmes Flick, a must for your collection if you are truly a ""Holmsian"".  Unfortunately this little gem was only released in The UK and Europe, and was produced in the parochial ""PAL"" format. Unlike every other Holmes Feature, it was never released in the US or Canada in NTSC.  So good luck in trying to find a copy you can view.  There are a few used VHS copies in circulation which will play in the US, they are diufficult to find.  This is an unfortunate act of omission which probably will not be corrected due to copyright regulations.  Judi Dench appears in her pre-James-Bond personna.",1231632000,4,614,4.5963302752293576
