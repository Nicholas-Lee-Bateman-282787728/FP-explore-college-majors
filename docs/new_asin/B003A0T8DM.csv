8392761,5,B003A0T8DM,Very happy to have found this segment on Lassie. Grew up watching the Lassie series on TV now watching repeats with my nephew. Looking into buying a collie for a pet to add to the family. Checking websites on puppies for sale.,1498176000,,226,4.404761904761905

8392763,4,B003A0T8DM,I don't know about this movie. I'm not ordered it. but you can  watch for free on YouTube. But if you want a dvd copy then order it. But for a copy I think $19.95 is a little pricey.,1473206400,,182,3.6666666666666665

8392765,3,B003A0T8DM,"I thought this was a DVD based on the amazon product description, so was surprised to receive a DVD-R disc (the disc surface is a purplish color and smells burned). I also noticed that the print on the back cover has some faded-out areas. There is no company name presented at the start or end of the video when watching it, and no standard FBI warning. All of which makes me believe this might be a bootleg. For a one-hour program on a DVD-R, the current price of $16.29 is expensive. The video quality is decent though, and this probably won't be released as a real DVD. You can also view this program free on the internet if you do some searching.

The program itself is the TV special broadcast in 1994, which is a decent overview of the Lassie movies and TV shows. June Lockhart narrates and there are segments with Tom Rettig and Jon Provost, Roddy McDowell, Claude Jarman and Janet Leigh among others. It does not have much depth that most diehard fans would appreciate, the program runs only 59 minutes, but for those who have modest interest in Lassie, this should provide a little more information than they knew before.",1424995200,3,1130,4.53921568627451
