Makes you appreciate taking time outs in your life to get out of yourself and involved with others.  His character, a salesman just keeping up with his traveling job, is, at heart, a kind man who ends up helping 3 other people.  In turn, they all help him realize what is most important in enjoying life.",1505520000,,442,4.4875

I m a huge fan of Franck Dubosc. I love his one man show , his sense of humor and his acting. After watching him in movies like "" les visteurs: la revolution"" ,""boule et bill"", bienvenue  bord"" et many other i decided to give a try to this movie since franck dubosc is the main character ( Bajau Marc). Sadly his acting could not save the movie . The movie is slow, the story boring .It just kept on dragging nd dragging and became painful to watch .
This movie must have been very challenging for him to play since he appears  lot more serious and dramatic . Not his typical role .
The other actors performances were mediocre at best , the way it has been filmed and directed was below mediocre . Its just a shame all the way around .  It had the potential to be either really funny ( like those good typical fench comedy movies) or really sad dramatic and emotional .It was hard to connect with the character or feel anything. Certain scenes in the movie could have been skipped completely since irrelevant .

To sum up, nothing extraordinary .

It's definitely not something i would ever want to watch again or recommend to my friends .

Note : Everything expresssed is my personal opinion and from my point of view .",1503964800,,1298,4.295081967213115
