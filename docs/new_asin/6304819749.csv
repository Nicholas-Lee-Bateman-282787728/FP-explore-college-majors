7878139,5,6304819749,"""The Natural History of Parking Lots"" is an interesting anachronism from 1990, shot in black and white and looking very much like a late-1960s New York City art film about disaffected youth, but with the rock group X's very hip, very 1980s ""Los Angeles"" on the soundtrack. Many of the scenes are truncated and confusing, without resolution, and Sam Taylor is never convincing as a man so obsessed with his portfolio, he nearly destroys the souls of his sons, Chris and Lance. There's a murky subplot about Lance Taylor buying guns for white-power racists, but why these people rely on him to get those guns is a mystery. Lance and Chris's final stand with one of the Neo-Nazis has a powerful punch, but it leads nowhere other than the death of one of the brothers. The script probably could have used another going-over before filming began. That said, the movie is a noble effort, and the actors turn in fine performances.",1453507200,,923,4.739130434782608
7878140,4,6304819749,"Well, I picked up the NSOPL with little hope, expecting to see a film of casual encounters of gay men in the fifties. I couldn't be more wrong. In spite of being in B&W, the film is from 1990, and tries to show a story of two brothers not well adjusted to the world they live in, but seems to gel well along together. The younger brother Chris (Charlie Bean) is not doing well in school, and has the terrible hobby of stealing old cars from parking lots, just for the fun of it. The father, to get somewhat rid of the problem, hire his older son Lance (B. Wyatt) by 2,000 bucks to take care of the younger sibling. And so the story goes, with the younger becoming more and more infatuated by the older, and even changing some habits. There is a lot of nudity and eye candy in the film, though masked for the lack of color, and the homoerotic climate between the brothers is obvious, at least for a gay audience. Things become obvious by any audience when we see the violent reaction of the younger toward seeing the older in a bathtub with his girlfriend, what he totally denies. The older brother soon understands all, approaching the younger sibling with a story that there are things boys do with girls that cant be done with others boys, as well as there are things that boys do themselves that cant be done with other girls.
The acting is good, and Mr. B. Wyatt, would appear lately in Luster with not so good results, but here hes a very sensuous man with a great body. The film unhappily couldn't finish well, doing to the lifestyle of the two brothers, one going again involve with stealing and the other with drugs, blackmailing of arms and the origins of its liaison to the brother. But its a good story I appreciated, once you can get used to the B&W and the poor sound quality. I would recommend it.",1445731200,,1811,4.345132743362832
7878141,5,6304819749,"Like so many of the films of Everett Lewis, a gay indie film producer whose for whose movies I am coming to have a real passion (an intense interest that aspires to be completist, although only some of his films are available on DVD or VHS). This one from 1990 (of which Strand Releasing`s publication on VHS tape is copyrighted 1994) is about two brothers` growing love and fierce attachment to each other, which gradually becomes sexualised as the younger of the two (Chris, played by Charlie Bean) falls, hard, with  love that includes sexual desire, for his elder brother (Lance, acted by B. Wyatt) who has the charge of him (paid for by their absent, uncaring father), who in turn surprises himself at how much affection he is developing for Chris. There is no explicit depiction of the carnality of the brotherly, incestuous love, and, indeed, many viewers, especially clueless heterosexuals, might never sense its presence in the film. There is a lot of nudity (almost never quite clearly visible when full frontal) and playfulness when one or both of the brothers is, or are, naked, whether as near-nude (shirtless or wearing only white briefs) or fully nude, or when dressed.

The real depth of the love of Chris and Lance for each other, and the increasingly sexualised nature of it, most clearly suggests itself in a conversation in which bisexual, ""hunky"" Lance tries to explain to boyishly willowy Chris, when the lad has seen Lance cavort amourously with his girlfriend, that he (and men generally) can have relations with women, and behave with them, in ways that two men cannot with each other, and vice-versa, something that Chris cannot accept easily. The two young men spend a lot of time on the road, variously alone or together, in the general Los Angeles area and further out in Southern California and even across the border in Tijuana, making Chris` attendance at high school continuingly erratic. The California terrain, urban and natural, are a joy to behold when filmed so evocatively as this.

The danger of Lance`s illegal dealings in drugs and weapons (with neo-nazis with whose cause, political and inchoately existential, he embraces in his own fuzzy way) eventually leads both to rather serious gun wounds for Chris, and, only a little later, fatal ones for Lance. The illegal activity that had landed Chris in trouble (to which he reverts) with the law is theft of vintage automobiles (hence the title of the movie). At the end of the film Chris, now forever bereft of his brother, boards a bus headed to nowhere important in particular, to continue his life, the wiser for some experience and wisdom hard-gained.

If the action of the film seems to lack focus, that surely is intentional, reflecting the meaninglessness of life around the brother and also as they live it themselves and travel constantly without much forethought. Only the bond that unites these brothers has any real meaning to them or to the viewer, so expecting a logically unfolding plot is counter-productive to appreciating the film. The mono sound on the VHS tape conveying the characters` conversation is not very clear, which certainly did not aid comprehension. Visually, the images on the screen, although gratifyingly clear and vivid, shake about on the screen at times, at least on the copy viewed. Despite the low budget on which Everett Lewis directed it, the b&w images often are very striking, the camera work as fine as could be obtained with such limited means.

It is advisable to search out information on, and interpretations, however brief, on this film before viewing it, which will facilitate comprehension as it progresses along seemingly aimlessly but, really, very effectively. This motion picture is not an ""easy view"" but it provides a most enriching cinematic experience, as Everett Lewis` films, each in its own way, always do so.",1341705600,2,3864,4.95679012345679
7878142,3,6304819749,"I can start off saying that this is NOT a genre of film I normally embrace, nor a set of characters who hold any particular interest for me. The film itself is pretty self-conciously ""arty"" -- vertiginous, hand-held camera work, sloppy montages of center dividers and asphalt, lousy sound, all done on an obvious shoestring. AND YET -- the central relationship as limned by Charlie Bean & Barry Wyatt is so powerful & nuanced that I wound up being blown away (OK, bad choice of words considering how the film ends). Why somebody hasn't figured out that Wyatt should be a major, major onscreen player is a total mystery to me. In the years since I first saw this film, I've been looking for him (& Charlie Bean as well) to crop up again, but other than in Everett Lewis' 2 other films (SKIN+BONE and LUSTER), no dice. There is no justice. All Lewis' films seem to be spottily acted and a bit messy, but within their somewhat clumsy awkwardness, they pulse with energy, sincerety, and life. Check this one out for the brilliantly calibrated dual performance at its center (which Lewis handles masterfully) & try to tune out the white noise surrounding it.",965952000,17,1153,4.6568627450980395
