3521249,5,B001D0JMGE,"I love this dvd! I began researching the subject while still a teenager ( I'm now 58 ) I don't know how to emphasize the vital importance of these stories directly from the people who have had the near death experience(NDE). Each story should be front page news around the globe ( they are that important!). My life has transformed and been aligned as a result exposure to the truths which these people express.  It will help remove not only the fear of ""death"", but guide you to the very meaning and purpose of life itself! How important is that kind of information especially when it could lead humanity to understand that all our thoughts and actions will be relived through the ""Life Review"" process? All those you have injured or were kind to will be re-experienced but without our regular filters so that their impact is significant. That we are only here to learn about the value and importance of love...the kind of love that is selfless and unconditional. The ""Golden Rule"" is simply what life is about. If you don't believe me...better watch this video! Good companion dvd's are ""Home & Back"" and ""Infinity-The Ultimate Trip..."".  Kenneth Ring's book ""Lessons from the Light"" is an excellent distillation of information collected from over 20 years of the near death research on his own and of other researchers around the world. View them all and be transformed for the betterment of yourself and the world as a whole as you will see, it is why your here. Enjoy!",1268352000,32,1473,4.705426356589148

The production qualities are excellent and the interviews credible, inspiring and so helpful to anyone facing the prospect of death - - and who of us are not? This is a 'must have' for everyone.",1240185600,8,357,5.172413793103448

3521252,5,B001D0JMGE,This DVD should be seen by anyone who has questions or fears about death and the after life and even those who don't fear it.  The individuals in the movie who had the near death experiences encountered such love and peace that it transformed their lives in an amazing way.  Listening to them recount their unique experiences should reassure us all that we have absolutely nothing to fear.,1238803200,15,389,4.705882352941177
3521253,5,B001D0JMGE,"If you are a student of near-death experiences, you'll want to have this short but delightful film in your collection. Featuring five NDErs, as well as insights from a theologian, a parapsychologist and a sociologist; it features the experiences in all their variety and profundity, told first-hand, as well as thoughtful reflections about life and death, time and its transcendence, and human spiritual evolution.  The movie places the viewer at the best NDE meeting or conference, absorbing the light of the experiences and the life-altering meaning of these transcendent visions.

3521254,5,B001D0JMGE,I have watched this movie over and over again. The NDE-ers give beautiful descriptions of heaven and the events that occurred while they were there. It's easy to see how emotional they are about their experience. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in near-death experiences. I would definitely purchase more DVDs like this one if they were available. I really enjoy being able to see the person's expression and emotion while they are describing their experience. This is something you don't get from reading about NDEs in a book.,1218499200,32,550,4.924731182795699
3521257,1,B001D0JMGE,Very short and abbreviated version of something that made no sense at all. Would not recommend to anyone else at all,1388188800,,116,4.571428571428571
3521258,2,B001D0JMGE,"This DVD really disappointed me... It is a video (not film) production made in 1996 and it lasts just about 40 mins. It is simply a collection of stories of people talking about their near death experiences. From time to time the director makes brief comments, which are interesting but not relevant.  Nothing of intellectual of theoretical relevance.  Dissappointing...",1375747200,,370,5.254237288135593
3521259,1,B001D0JMGE,"The quality of is movie was terrible. It looks like watching an old VHS. I also thought there would be re-enactments but it was just talking. I've seen better videos on YouTube than this. Save your money. I recommend the ""Beyond the Grave"" series.",1360972800,5,247,4.636363636363637
3521260,5,B001D0JMGE,"Excellent documentary with roundtable discussion of people who have had near death experiences.  I wish they had included Dannion Brinkley, who was one of the first well-documented near death experiencers, but nonetheless, this is a very comforting, loving production.  I just wish it had been longer than 40 minutes.",1300924800,4,317,5.448979591836735
3521261,5,B001D0JMGE,AS A HOSPICE SOCIAL WORKER I HAVE OFFERED THIS DVD TO MY PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. IT HAS GIVEN THEM HOPE AND COMFORT THAT HAS SUSTAINED THEM IN TIMES OF GRIEF. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD.,1296864000,5,216,4.425
3521262,3,B001D0JMGE,"I was not terribly impressed with the testimonies of these people, or the quality of the film, but I do believe they had these experiences.  Is it worth watching? Maybe.  But I have seen a lot better films on this subject.",1293494400,3,222,4.390243902439025
3521263,5,B001D0JMGE,I am very satisfied - this was exactly what I wanted - a clear DVD.,1278720000,3,67,3.533333333333333
3521264,3,B001D0JMGE,"It was a very interesting, but it shifted the NDE's around to much. Instead of each person telling their story all at once it would go back and forth between one perosn to another. Some of the back ground music was disruptive.",1276387200,7,226,4.404761904761905
3521265,3,B001D0JMGE,"From all the great reviews, I expected more. 3 1/2 stars. The first hand accounts of near death experience were great, but I was expecting more information from the clinical and religious view point. It is comforting, but its a very short production, 40 minutes, and at the end I was thinking, ""Is this it?"" I wish it could have been expanded more with the clinical view as well.  Watch in combination with The Search for Heaven.  I give that one 3 1/2 stars as well.",1271462400,9,467,4.4186046511627906
3521266,5,B001D0JMGE,I really like this production because it includes experiencers that I've never heard of and because the experiencers are given the time to go into a good bit of detail.  A very refreshing NDE documentary.  Highly recommended.,1269216000,6,225,5.054054054054054
8290727,5,B001D0JMGE,"Authentic people of reasonable intelligence, that were in close-enough close-up shots so that you can read and see the emotion in their eyes,  along with the tone and the detail of how the experiences affected them and in telling what happened, was done well.  Not a lot of fluff, but tons of interest, and a down-to-earth way of filming subjects telling their experiences was an excellent way of doing such a documentary and a style that I find really interesting, and good - no fluff, just facts, reported by subjects in an excellent manner.",1523232000,,543,4.76595744680851

8290729,3,B001D0JMGE,"What is it like to die? Where do you end up next? This DVD is about people who died and they have quite a story to tell. Basically this is just interviews with people who have had a near-death experience. So people just talk about their experience and the conversations are organized logically according to the topics being discussed.

What you will learn is that when people die they obtain total knowledge, feel bliss, have life reviews, talk to angels, see a tunnel and go towards a light which feels like unconditional love. The experiences these people have sound very normal as I've read all the main books on near-death experiences.

The only thing I'd say about this DVD in particular is that is has a sort of New Age leaning. ""We are all one, one is all"" is said by one of the women and there is no talk of negative experiences which do occur and there are books on that subject. This DVD seems to give hope but also may be overly positive.

Yes you should not fear death if your soul is going to heaven but not all people report positive experiences. So my suggestion is to watch this, but also to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-Our-Eternal-Home/dp/B0000CBXYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven:Our Eternal Home</a>.

8290730,5,B001D0JMGE,"I loved this DVD and have watched it countless times.  It brings a lot of comfort and I appreciale the views from the para- psychologist, philosopher and theologian, as well.  Everyone on this DVD sounds really honest in expressing their emotions and experiences, and it's easy to feel as if you were in the room with them having this conversation.",1454544000,,348,4.783333333333333
