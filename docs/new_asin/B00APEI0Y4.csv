8555666,5,B00APEI0Y4,"Just purchased this set to add to my Global Ride collection. I have to agree with the other review that this is the best of the series, The scenery, both city and in the country are amazing. I do a lot of indoor bike training. The weather in NJ in the winter and the traffic in the some makes riding outdoors a challenge. Actually, bought a new bike in Nov and put it right on the trainer. I have a large library of commercial DVDs including Spinervals (from the VHS era), Bike-O-Vision and Rides. I also started watching the free you tube videos which probably contributed to the conclusion of the series. Without a doubt, I continue to say, this series is the best. The warm up and cool downs, which is Gene doing a commentary on the series over a compilation of stills from the area of the world the set was filmed, is just great. The coaching and the feel that you are riding as part of a group keeps you on the bike, interested and motivated. The specific scenery in Spain is very interesting. All in all, I really get the feel, that when I'm riding alone in my basement in Jan (outside temp 15f), that I'm part of a group on an excursion to Spain, France, Italy or Hawaii. I usually drink a glass or two of wine from the country of the ride, post work-out. I'm looking forward to doing the 2 plus hour climb of Haleakala today from the Maui series!",1515974400,,1354,4.272373540856031

I absolutely LOVE these.  There are so many options too with different length and difficulty rides within each DVD so you get so much more than you are expecting.  As ever the music selection is inspiring and motivating and the on-road coaching with Tom and the chat with the other riders is both informative and fun and makes you feel like you are riding up alongside (or at least trying to keep up!).  The scenery is great and I never tire of these rides.

In addition the Class Builder information is really useful for both myself when I train alone, or if I use one of these in my Indoor Cycling classes - it really helps when pushing hard if you know a recovery is coming up soon - gives you motivation to do just that little bit more than you thought you could.

Also the timed sections and variety within each ride is great and helps keep everything fresh and new - no chance for the mind to drift away and lose the plot!
I can't wait for the next set of DVDs and would love to be involved in riding/filming somewhere -anywhere!!!  Where next ????",1376092800,,1187,4.272321428571429
8555668,5,B00APEI0Y4,"Global RIdes, in conjunction with Cycling Fusion, has been producing quality virtual cycling DVDs since 2008. They are the ""pioneers"" in the field, starting a trend that keeps improving and growing. The first series was Hawaii Rides, produced in 2008. Then came Italy, France, local Pittsburgh rides (my personal favorite ""The Dirty Dozen""), and now Spain Rides. They have continued to improve with each series, adding more HD quality camera focus and tailored rides. Spain is unique in its use of ""on the road"" coaching courtesy of Tom Scotto. The scenery is lush. The road is tough and brutal. This series packs a powerful punch.

I cannot say enough good things about this series. Each DVD gives the rider multiple options. Spain gives you extra bonus material that hasn't been seen on the other series. The variety is spectacular. Too, you could do one disk and do it again the next day and not get bored. The best part is the rider feels like he or she is transported to Spain, riding along, and completely involved in the ride. This is a pleasure. For someone who is stuck riding indoors permanently, this is the best escape. You feel like you are there and there is no price to high to pay for this pleasure. I know these rides will only get better in the future. You will not regret purchasing these rides. They're a must have.",1357344000,,1335,4.656779661016949
