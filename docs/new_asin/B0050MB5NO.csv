4515649,2,B0050MB5NO,"I am a steven seagal fan and have quite a few of his dvds, I also have a few of his collectibles.  I was shocked when i opened this last one {4 film favorites, hard to kill, on deadly ground, exit wounds and out for justice.}  I've never seen a collection packed in this manner, is this what we have to look forward to? The word for this packing is STACKABLE, yes I said STACKABLE, one on top of the other.
Just trying to get the bottom one out is a feat.  I would have liked to know how this was packaged, I don't think I would have purchased this one!",1312502400,5,553,3.963963963963964
4515650,5,B0050MB5NO,"Every citizen of Earth is required to own at least one Steven Seagal movie and be ready to quote it to other citizens of Earth. If you weren't aware of this, now you are so there's no excuse. You may ask yourself ""Wait, how did I get here? Why do I HAVE to watch a Seagal movie?"" Asking that question was your first mistake. Your second mistake was not watching one in the first place. See what I did there? Now you're ready to rock.

Hard To Kill stars Mr. Seagal as a comatose cop named Mason Storm who does things his OWN way. Mason wakes up none too happy with the universe (for fairly good reasons) and then proceeds to mow down everybody in his path, all the while firing off classic, memorable lines of dialogue like - ""What year is it?"" and ""How does it feel to know you're about to die?"" Every time Mason throws somebody through a window, take a drink. INCLUDES: * Widescreen [16x9 1.85:1] Version * Steven Seagal Trailer Gallery * Production Notes * Languages & Subtitles: English, Franais & Espaol (Main Feature. Bonus Material/Trailer May Not Be Subtitled).

Exit Wounds stars Mr. Seagal as an ornery cop named Orin Boyd who is all up his Captain's face daily... doing Tai Chi on Daniels' LAST nerve. Even though Boyd takes care of business like a mofo and saves the day, he does it his OWN way. Daniels can't have none of that mess so he busts Boyd back down to precinct 15 so fast it makes his head spin. The fellas in the new division ain't havin' none of his mess right back so Boyd proceeds to mow down everybody in his path, all the while firing off classic, memorable lines of dialogue like - ""You used to work for Internal Affairs."" and ""Why don't you take a walk?"" Every time Orin furrows his brow, take a drink. INCLUDES: * Widescreen Version [16x9 2.4:1] * Featurette The Making of Exit Wounds * DMX No Sunshine Music Video * A Day on the Set with Anthony Anderson * Theatrical Trailer * Languages: English & Franais (Dubbed in Quebec) * Subtitles: English, Franais & Espaol (Main Feature. Bonus Material/Trailer May Not Be Subtitled).

On Deadly Ground stars Mr. Seagal as Forrest Taft - a specialist in putting out oil rig fires... his OWN way. That makes somebody angry since they would really just prefer he did things the way everybody else does. To express their annoyance, they hunt down Taft and his associates with a relentless, murderous intent. Taft then proceeds to mow down everybody in his path, all the while firing off classic, memorable lines of dialogue like ""What does it take to change the essence of a man?"" and ""I wouldn't dirty my bullets."" Every time you see Dr. Cox from Scrubs, take a drink. INCLUDES: * Widescreen Version [16x9 2.4:1] * Languages & Subtitles: English & Franais.

Out For Justice stars Mr. Seagal as Gino Felino - a NYPD detective who does things his OWN way. Gino's partner gets treated very unfairly by a local drug kingpin, (because he was doin' things the Felino way) and this harsh treatment of his partner does not sit well with Gino at all. Therefore, he proceeds to mow down everybody in his path, all the while firing off classic, memorable lines of dialogue like ""Anybody seen Richie?"" and ""I'm gonna keep comin' back until someone REMEMBERS seein' Richie!"" Every time Gino asks another character if they have seen Richie, take a drink. INCLUDES: * Widescreen Version [16x9 2.4:1] * Languages & Subtitles: English & Franais.",1311033600,29,3400,4.577996715927751

4515767,3,B0050MB5NO,"What more can you say about Steven Seagal  except "" kick Ass""  I love Seagal when I just want to watch a movie that I don't have to think about. I own just about all of his movies and watch them often when I just want to kick back and enjoy the bad guy get his ""Upcomings"".  Exit Wounds, Hard To Kill, Out For Justice and On Deadly Ground all on individual DVDs ( I hate when they put two or more movies on a DVD or Blu ray )

4515768,5,B0050MB5NO,"I like his fairly soft-spoken approach to his adversaries. I am not an expert. But his karate is easy to believe as that of an expert. I like most of his movies, except one or two that seemed too urban for my taste.",1368230400,,215,4.023255813953488

4515774,1,B0050MB5NO,"The movies themselves weren't the problem, the problem is how the four dvds are jammed into the case carelessly. They're all jammed into one little slot that is usually reserved for only one disc. Considering this was a gift, I'm highly upset.",1356393600,3,243,4.809523809523809

4515776,3,B0050MB5NO,"A word of warning for future purchases - I purchased this today and despite the cover saying that the set contains two DVDs with a movie on each side, there are in fact four stacked DVDs on one spindle. Furthermore, despite the cover (and indeed each disc) stating that each of the four films are 16x9 transfers, they are in fact a mixture of 16x9 and 4:3 (pan and scan transfers)! In my set, On Deadly Ground was 4:3, whilst the rest were the proper widescreen versions.

I may just have had a faulty batch, but be warned.

As for the movies, they range from the classics of Hard to Kill and Out for Justice, to the unusual but hellishly brutal On Deadly Ground to the so-so Exit Wounds. Normally this set would have had a 4 star rating overall, but the terrible pan and scan disc makes it lose a star.",1355270400,6,803,4.276315789473684
