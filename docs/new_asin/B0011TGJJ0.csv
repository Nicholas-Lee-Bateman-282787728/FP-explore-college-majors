8242187,3,B0011TGJJ0,"Agree with other reviewer. The English accented speaker doesn't seem appropriate. And since Finland has such awesome outdoor scenery it's a shame the producers didn't choose to show more of this. As it is, this video is mainly a quickie look at 200 yr-old buildings in many Finnish cities. Not worth much money, but, then, there aren't too many Finnish DVD tour guides out there, so it's better than nothing. Buy it USED from Amazon--it's not worth buying a new copy.",1350259200,2,467,4.777777777777778
8242188,4,B0011TGJJ0,"This is a very economical way to enjoy the country that is Finland. Keep in mind that there are many places to cover, so not much time is spent on individual locations. The videography is quite lovely and really brings out the natural beauty of the landscape. The only drawback is the narration. I wish the voice-over artist actually knew how to pronounce the place names. It got to be quite distracting after the first few errors. Finnish is not that difficult to pronounce. The same rules apply each time. Perhaps next time, if there is a newer version, the producers could enlist the help of a native Finn! For anyone who is not so particular about the pronunciations, this is still a great way to visit Finland.",1215993600,12,715,4.59375
