There's a conspiracy afoot in France that has inadvertantly spread from the Royal Court of the King into the surrounding countryside, bringing death and destruction to a distant convent. One of the residence of this religious community happens to be Eloise (Sophie Marceau), the daughter of the famous musketeer D'Artagan.

After the murder of the Reverend Mother, Eloise leaves the convent, returning to Paris to find her Father (Philippe Noiret) in the hope of convincing him to use his fighting skills to bring the culprits to justice. As you might have guessed, this turns out to be a job that will require more than one musketeer. Soon D'Artagan and Eloise are joined by Porthos (Raoul Billerey), Aramis (Sami Frey) and Athos (Jean-Luc Bideau) and the battle is on.

This was a boring movie. Instead of making an action / adventure film directors Travernier and Blossier opted for a comedy. What's worse, it wasn't funny. Watching four old men who could barely walk pretend to fight off large numbers of younger and faster foes was a real stretch of the imagination. It just didn't work at all. Too bad, because the production values were first rate.

The only real energy in this production was generated by the charming Sophie Marceau. If not for her presence this film would have been impossible for me to finish. Thanks for being there Sophie.",1116460800,29,1390,4.927350427350428
1042111,4,6305492093,"The whole premise behind the 570 musketeer films that have been released thus far (Dec. 2003) is pretty flimsy, and the premise behind this one is among the flimsiest.

BUT--for people who like to watch adventure-comedies in which beautiful women kick butt, this belongs on your shelf beside the CHARLIE'S ANGELS films.

The chief advantage this film has over other members of this genre is that it stars the ever-adorable Sophie Marceau. We get to see her fence with evil-doers and have a tender moment or two with her aging father, the famous D'Artagnan. The script is better than average, and the film contains many other scenes that are enjoyable in various ways.

In sum, if you happen to like musketeer films, this one is far better than the half dozen big-budget productions that have come out of Hollywood in the past few years. (Sorry, Leonardo. Yours stank, despite its high-powered cast.)

Finally, in case you want to watch this with your grandparents, you should be aware that the heroine has a brief topless scene that might give somebody a heart attack.",1070496000,9,1068,4.851648351648351
1042112,3,6305492093,"The spirit of Dumas is alive and well as D'Artagnan and his three legendary companions regroup and once again go forth in defense of the Crown in ""Revenge of the Musketeers,"" directed by Bertrand Tavernier.  This time around, however, it's D'Artagnan's daughter, Eloise (Sophie Marceau), who sounds the alarm after witnessing a cold-blooded murder at the convent she has called home these many years, having been raised there while her father was off on one adventure after another in service to the King.  And it's the King for whom Eloise is concerned; in the wake of the murder, she has uncovered a conspiracy to assassinate the about-to-be-crowned Louis XIV during his coronation.  Her evidence is a cryptic message discovered among the personal effects of the recently deceased resident of the convent.  So throwing caution to the wind, Eloise takes to horseback, alone, to seek out her father and inform him of this threat to France and the King.  What she doesn't know is that D'Artagnan (Philippe Noiret) has recently withdrawn from the service of the King, and not by his own choosing.  It seems that the King-to-be is something of an upstart, the fact of which D'Artagnan conveyed to him personally-- in no uncertain terms-- after which the now former Musketeer retired to private life to give lessons in the art of swordsmanship.  All of which is about to change with the arrival of the daughter he hasn't seen for many years, and who to his knowledge is still safely ensconced in the convent.
 To successfully present yet another episode of ""The Three Musketeers,"" it must have that certain sense of bold carelessness born of confidence and larger-than-life adventure, and Tavernier's film has it.  Though it takes a couple of scenes to find it's legs after an intense opening that makes you sit up and take notice, when it finally kicks in (which it does fairly quickly) it becomes a rousing adventure steeped in the tradition of it's predecessors.  And, as in the best of the ""Musketeer"" movies, it's laced with subtle humor and intrigue.  Tavernier sets a pace that is at times inconsistent, but he provides enough action and fun that it can be easily overlooked; it may threaten to stall occasionally, but never actually does.
 Philippe Noiret cuts a striking figure as the aging D'Artagnan, who though slowed somewhat by the years, is still one of the best swords around.  He successfully embodies that spirit and sense of ""legend"" that makes his D'Artagnan believable, and delivers it all with the confidence befitting his character.
 The highlight of the film, however, is the lovely Marceau, who as Eloise proves that she can cross swords with the best of them.  Her technique with a blade may be a bit awkward at times, but it gives credibility to the character; a young woman raised in a convent-- even the daughter of a famed Musketeer-- wouldn't necessarily be a master swordsman.  And Marceau gives a lively performance as Eloise, diving into the action with a reckless abandon that makes her endearing, as well as fun to watch.  She has a radiant screen presence that draws the eye to her, even in a crowded scene.  But what really puts this character across-- and again, the entire film, for that matter-- is that unabashed spirit of adventure, which Marceau manifests in Eloise.
 The supporting cast includes Claude Rich (Crassac), Sami Frey (Aramis), Jean-Luc Bideau (Athos), Raoul Billerey (Porthos), Charlotte Kady (Eglantine de Rochefort), Nils Tavernier (Quentin), Luigi Proietti (Mazarin) and Jean-Paul Roussillon (Planchet).  Proving that even Musketeers beyond their prime can be engaging, especially when combined with a spirited beauty like Marceau, ""Revenge of the Musketeers"" is a welcome cinematic chapter in the saga Dumas began so many years ago.  In the end, it's a satisfying experience that will transport you to another place and another time, when chivalry was alive and well, and right always triumphed over wrong.",988243200,41,3963,5.019847328244275
1042113,5,6305492093,"With all due respect to The Three & Four Musketeers of Richard Lester, Revenge of the Musketeers surpasses these and all other Dumas musketeer films ever.  This takes into account a lot of movies, from Fairbanks to Walter Abel, the Ritz Brothers, Louis Hayward, Gene Kelly, Hal Roach Jr., Gordon Scott, Louis Jourdan, Cornel Wilde, and lately Leonardo with Gabriel Byrne et al.  Never mind Sophie Marceau fencing with the guys with nary a lesson.  Sophie's fine.  My money's on Sophie over feisty Kim Cattrall of Lester's Return of the Musketeers.  It's reverence that really makes Revenge a winner; reverence for Dumas Pere.  D'Artagnan first sees his daughter (Sophie) and mistakes her for long-dead Constance.  He alludes to the 'Porthos thrust' and the 'Aramis thrust.'  Planchet remains addled, and now aged.  Porthos can be lured out of retirement with mounds of food.  Brooding Aramis as always follows intrigue.  Athos says much with few rasping words.  They reunite and allude longingly to the old days, and we feel their aches and pains, and smile at inside references to old foes among the Cardinal's guards.  Never mind the slow spots and confusing plot machinations.  This is Dumas-inspired after all.  Just savor the French sensibilities and the gentle mockery of Mazarin, and D'Artagnan spurring his comrades on by saying, 'We can't let Cyrano have all the fun!'  Oh yeah, Sophie gets naked, which can't hurt.  And the swordplay is excellent, a la William Hobbs.  We may never see the likes of this one again.  Magnifique one and all!",982972800,27,1549,5.003921568627451
1042114,3,6305492093,"After a slow start, Revenge of the Musketeers (originally released in France as La Fille de D'Artagnan) picks up some dash and humor by the second half and leaves the viewer credibly entertained.  There are good performances from all the cast (except a fairly colorless love-interest for Marceau's Eloise), who seem to be enjoying themselves immensely.  The lovely Sophie Marceau gets to parade in a variety of flattering cavalier costumes and the villains are full of bravado and duplicity as befits these sort of romps.  Messieurs Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan may be twenty years older than in their heyday, but they still have plenty of fight in them, and when the headstrong daughter of D'Artagnan  unmasks a nasty conspiracy -- or IS it? -- they race into action once again for France and King Louis.
The production is top-notch and Marceau's Eloise suitably steals the show, giving perhaps the best swordswoman display since Kim Cattrall's Justine in Richard Lester's ""Return of the Musketeers"", which this film most resembles. (Close runner-up: Catherine Zeta-Jones in ""The Mask of Zorro."") The pace seems less than dynamic, perhaps due in part to the strange lack of a musical score to complement the action -- you'll appreciate just how much the soundtrack can add to a scene when you watch these au naturel  fights and duels.  But on the whole, this was better than I'd expected  and eminently watchable, with a fine spirit that even bursts out of the closing credits.  En garde, mes braves! A cheval! (Add an extra star if you truly love films of this genre.)",980899200,,1580,4.935849056603773
1042115,5,6305492093,"There should be more than five stars to rate this movie. Philippe Noiret as usual is wonderful, including the beautiful Sophie Marceau of ""Brave Heart"" and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" The great Charlotte Kady has the best role in the film which regrettably should have been longer.",973209600,,282,5.0212765957446805
1042211,5,6305492093,"I knew she was a good actress...but the sword fighting and horsemanship she brought to the screen  surprised me!  She really is very talented.  I only wish she would make more American films.  The subtitles in English help me understand the movie since I suffer hearing loss, so it enables me to follow everything in the movie.

1042215,5,6305492093,"I love Lester's The Three and the Four Musketeers...ever since I was a boy having watched them in the seventies. The Return of the Musketeers in 1989 was fun but a bit depressing in a nostalgic kind of way.  Revenge of the Musketeers makes it all ok again.  I think Dumas would be grinning ear to ear to watch this movie; it is completely true to the characters and their spirit.  As a period film, it is excellent.  Not once did I remember I was just watching a movie...I was transported back to 17th century France.  The swordplay, the horses, the touching and believable relationship between D'Artagnan and his daugher, the magnificently beautiful Sophie Marceau...there is nothing not to love about this movie.  To finally see a Musketeer movie of the Lester movies' quality and fun, but in proper French is a delight (I'll somewhat agree with one of the other posters that the English translation subtitles are not exactly right...but in fairness, it's difficult to capture the whole meaning and beautiful subtlety of French in an English translation...but at least one scene was PG'd translation-wise when it didn't need to be - it's 'R' after all!)  If you love Lester's Musketeer movies from the 70's, this movie is a delicious after-dinner dessert.",1284595200,,1257,4.873239436619718
1042216,3,6305492093,"Revenge of the Musketeers is an enjoyable movie to watch.  Typical swashbuckler.  The special treat is that this is one of the few movies I've ever found where Sophie Marceau does a nude scene!  The scene is very tasteful and very, very funny and so appropriate for the movie.  If you're a Three Musketeers fan at all, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",1277596800,,351,4.523809523809524

1042218,5,6305492093,i really enjoyed this movie. it stays true to the musketeer genre with out totally rehashing the story. the fight scenes are great and there are lots of funny bits. it is in french so you have to read subtitles but it isn't that bad. if you like a good swashbuckeling flick you need this one.,1224028800,,292,4.232142857142857
1042219,3,6305492093,"I collect a lot of ""swashbuckling"" movies and considering the cast and the subject matter, I guess this was a required addition.

It was enjoyable enough and Sophie Marceau's visual charms are not to be ignored. However, pacing-wise and fight choreography-wise, I expected more from a French team. Compared to a couple of my recent acquisitions: Le Bossu and Cyrano de Bergerac (w/Depardieu), it's really not in the same league.

A pleasant enough diversion, but not really a keeper.",1206057600,,483,5.10126582278481
1042220,4,6305492093,"I've only ever seen Sophie Marceau in English-speaking roles before, and, while I thought she was a fine actress, it wasn't until I saw her in her native French milieu that I duly became impressed. REVENGE OF THE MUSKETEERS is a Sophie Marceau vehicle all the way; the scenes are never more delightful than when she graces the screen. I enjoyed her infectious enthusiasm as she threw herself fully into the role of the headstrong, adventurous Eloise D'Artagnan. Philippe Noiret was also noteworthy as the grizzled D'Artagnan, father of Eloise, now retired in disgrace from the ranks of the Musketeers. The rest of the cast was excellent, as well, with special mention going out to Sami Frey (Aramis), Gigi Proietti (Cardinal Mazarin), and Claude Rich (Duke of Crassac).

The convent in which the young Eloise D'Artagnan is being fostered is assaulted by swordsmen led by a woman in red. The Mother Superior is murdered and, in the aftermath of the attack, Eloise finds a blooded document, which she believes is the key to uncovering a deadly plot. She goes to Paris in search of her famous father, D'Artagnan, whom she hadn't seen in years, and finds him happy to see her but disinclined to believe her tale. However, certain events occur which alter D'Artagnan's thinking, who then decides to involve his old comrades. When you add to that mix a lovestruck but combat-ignorant poet, a one-eyed spy, a duplicitous femme fatale, an ambitious duke, a conniving cardinal, a slave ring, and coffee, well, somewhere in there, there just HAS to be a conspiracy in the offing, right? Right. There is a conspiracy and it's that same old conspiracy again, namely, to assassinate the monarch of France. But, thanks to the not-quite-decrepit ex-Musketeers and the resolute Eloise - who is powered by a sense of honor and justice, even if she's a bit lacking in the finer points of fencing - the King of France is in good hands.

A bit reminiscent of Richard Lester's THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1973), the lighthearted storyline proficiently toes the line between swashbuckling and comedy. The sword fights aren't that exemplary, but the film does have an out in that the main protagonists consist of a girl raw with the sword and four curmudgeonly, even arthritic, blades. But, what they lack in speed and dexterity, they make up for in enthusiasm and elderly flair. The comedy is superb and is nicely meshed within the story. I got a kick out of the fact that each of the opposing parties come upon innocuous messages (one a laundry list, the other a poem) that they think are in secret code and end up wasting much of the movie attempting to decode them. One of the verbal high points is when Aramis is apprised of yet another plot to kill the king; he remarks with an offended ""But that's so dated!"" Another is when, after Sophie has the frustrated villain, Crassac, at an impasse in their deadly swordfight, he asks her if her blade was longer than his. And then, of course, there's all those elderly jokes, as offered by the aged D'Artagnan and his cohorts.

So, here's what we got: misunderstandings, behind-the-throne machinations, high adventure and swordplays, low and high-brow comedy, a father-daughter relationship, the return of classic Dumas characters, and the introduction of a lovely and fiery heroine - Eloise D'Artagnan. Which brings us full circle to Sophie Marceau. As I've said, this is her vehicle. She displays full commitment and brings beauty, unaffected charm, and unfettered zest to the table. Her Eloise doesn't mind getting muddy or physically exerting herself; she athletically jumps on and rides horses, leaps on tables, violently slings furniture, and recklessly brandishes a sword. The only thing she doesn't do is swing on chandeliers, though I have no doubt she would've done that with gusto, as well.",1160352000,10,3821,4.920930232558139
