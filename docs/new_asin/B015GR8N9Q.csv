7436113,5,B015GR8N9Q,"I left this screening in a white heat of rage against ALL Americans whose insatiable appetite for drugs provides the funding for this horrific blood bath! How can we not see that the problem is NOT the cartels, it's the buyers who FUND the cartels! If there is no market, there is no cartel. To me it looks like a simple case of cause and effect.

Director Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners""), working with a screenplay by actor Taylor Sheridan (""Sons of Anarchy"") ramps up the horror of what an idealistic FBI agent encounters when she volunteers to work with a CIA team along the Mexican border. The charnel house they discover in the early part of the film sets the tone, while the unsettling soundtrack underscores an overwhelming sense of misery and doom.

Here we have:
  * Emily Blunt (""Edge of Tomorrow"") Kate is determined to make her mark in the FBI. When she sees this chance to make a difference against the drug cartels, she volunteers.
  * Daniel Kaluuya (""Babylon"") is her FBI sidekick Reggie. He is not quite so idealistic but he still ""mothers"" Kate.
  * Victor Garber (Lots of TV) FBI chief Jennings asks Kate if she can see any changes in her world after their latest successful foray.
  * Josh Brolin (""Labor Day"") CIA agent Matt is always upbeat, smiling and focused. He has a realistic view of his mission and knows exactly why Kate has been added to his team.
  * Benicio Del Toro (""Inherent Vice"") Alejandro will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. He has a spooky way of appearing and disappearing with unsettling regularity. His sicario makes a formidable enemy!

This R-rated crime drama has more grisly scenes than you may expect. It's one thing to READ about decapitations, torture, and betrayals, but it is another thing entirely to see them in living color! This film will stay with you for a long time. If you are anything like me, you will cry ""Shame!"" at any part of the drug trade, no matter how inconsequential it may appear. BTW, in Mexico ""Sicario"" means ""Hitman.""",1444262400,,1998,4.6581196581196584
7436114,5,B015GR8N9Q,"I was not expecting to be blown away when I went to the theatre to see this movie... and I was, literally blown away. Sicario means Hit Man/Assasin - with that said, it is not a family movie. Do not take the kiddies, unless of course you don't mind them being desensitized to gory violence. Aside from some incredibly graphic scenes, the movie hit all points: Acting, Benedicio Del Toro is so very good. He simply amazing. I don't know if I should love his character, or run screaming for the hills. Emily Blunt as the ""by-the-book"" FBI Agent is more than refreshing, she's a perfect mix for all the testosterone this movie delivers. Plot, just when you think you got this movie figured out, it gives you a nice little twist. Action, lots and lots of great action scene. One after another. The visuals in this movie will stay with you for a long time, both good and bad. If you liked ""No County for Old Men"", then you will love Sicario.",1444003200,2,936,4.416184971098266
7436115,5,B015GR8N9Q,"I have waited ever so patiently to see this movie. When I saw the trailer earlier this year, I did research on the movie which led me to discover that director Denis Villeneuve (who also directed 2013's Prisoners and Enemy) also directed Sicario. Not surprisingly, his movie Sicario is not only suspenseful and thrilling, but it delivers some outstanding performances.

From the moment Sicario starts we see Emily Blunt's character Kate Macer graces the screen with a fearless but alert mindset. Josh Brolin's character Matt Graver is one you never are sure whether or not if you should trust. And while both Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin are terrific in their respectable roles, one has to truly appreciate the dark and serious portrayal of Alejandro by actor Benicio Del Toro. His character is both towering and intimidating by all means, and I would not be at all surprised to see his name pop up come awards season.

Even better, the story of Sicario is easy to follow. Mind you, Sicario is not one of those non-stop action films, but because it mixes suspense, action, and plots the scenarios with the Mexican Cartel/FBI in a believable way. I can not help but to applaud Denis Villeneuve for the crafting this timely and well shot thriller that is Sicario. Make no mistake, if you are looking for a thrilling time at the movies, then look no further than Sicario. Great cast, believable story, and brilliantly directed.

My Consensus: GO SEE Sicario",1443916800,183,1453,4.827309236947791
7436116,4,B015GR8N9Q,"""Sicario"" (2015 release; 112 min.) brings the story of the fight against a (fictional) Mexican drug cartel. As the movie opens, we are informed about the origin of the word sicario (zealots of Jerusalem) and that it is the Mexican term for hit man. Then we are immediately dropped into the action, as we see Kate and the rest of her FBI Special Weapons and Tactic Team overpower the tenants of a house in suburban Phoenix, only to make a gruesome discovery. It's not long before Kate, who wants to bring justice to whoever did that, is recruited to a joint task force with DOD to track down a drug lord in Mexico. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, who previously brought us the outstanding (and Oscar-nominated) film ""Incendies"" a few years ago. Here Villeneuve examines the battle(s) between the Mexican cartels and the US government. Second, as the movie started playing out, when things are quite complex to grasp all that is going on, we find ourselves in good company, as it turns out that the Kate character is equally confused herself. It all becomes clear later on. Third, this is one of the most tense movies I have seen in a long, long time. From the opening scenes, you are clammed up as you're watching what is unfolding, and the amazing thing is that the movie simply DOESN'T LET UP. There are some unbelievable scenes that will have your jaw drop to the floor (no worries, I won't spoil). Fourth, it also must be stated that this movie is unrelenting in its violence and brutality. If that is a potential issue for you (and you know yourself better than anyone), please do not tempt fate. This movie is simply not for the faint of heart, and then some. Fifth, kudos to some outstanding performances, including Emily Blunt (as Kate). Watch her face when she expresses doubts about the legality of what is happening, and her superior tells her ""If you fear you're out of bounds, you're not. The boundary has been moved"", wow. Benicio del Toro is equally top notch as the mysterious advisor to the joint task force. Last but not least, there is a fantastic orchestral score, courtesy of Icelandic composer Jhann Jhannsson ( who previously gave us the equally delightful score for ""The Theory of Everything""). Bottom line: ""Sicario"" is one of the best movies I have seen this year, and that is saying something, as I see a LOT of movies.

""Sicario"" opened nationwide today and I couldn't wait to go see it. The evening screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was PACKED,  much to my surprise. Guess there still is demand for a top-notch quality movie that doesn't involve comic action heroes. If you can stand the violence and the unrelenting tension, do yourself a favor and go check this out, be it in the theater, or Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Sicario"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1443744000,5,3011,4.6773584905660375
7436117,5,B015GR8N9Q,"This is an exceptional but very brutal movie. It's not a date movie. Leave the kids at home. Two FBI agents follow up a strong lead on kidnapping by Mexicans that takes them, and a small group, to a lonely house in Chandler, Arizona, near Phoenix. Breaking into the house, they confront a few Mexican suspects, and battle for control. After that, they begin the process of analysis, which uncovers a large number of human cadavers mounted into the walls of the house. One agent inspects a locked attic in a garage; setting off a time-bomb which kills two officers. Horrified by both the stash of human bodies, and the booby-trap, the two agents, a young woman, and a black agent, agree to join a US Government elite force which is targeting the Sonora drug cartel;  responsible for this terrible crime, and much, much more. This begins a wild adventure for the two agents. . Their next stop is Juarez, Mexico, where the special US forces will attempt to bring a major-name drug cartel leader across the border. Unknown assailants will be watching. Just down the road, these two agents will find out quickly about US/Mexican anti drug cartel operations. It's not pretty. And some big shocking secrets are coming up...Director Denis Villeneuve fashions a sober, calculated story which skips the typical TV .police drama. Nothing typical here. Filmed on location in New Mexico and Mexico, Villeneuve paints a colorful, red, blue, and pink series of pretty desert vistas and sunsets. Into this probable paradise, he opens up a doorway to hell. Emily Blunt is very good as the idealistic young FBI agent, and Josh Brolin is the US agent group leader. Brolin is restrained here, almost intentionally. This is well done, as the real power of the movie is Benecio Del Toro, as a rogue US agent, with his own revenge agenda on his mind. Del Toro is very powerful here; easily his finest work. Calm and quiet, then wild and savage, Benicio Del Toro takes a stab at becoming the Mexican Marlon Brando. Probably. ""Sicario"" is not for everybody. Maybe it's not for anybody. But's it's highly recommended. ""Quien Sabe?....Por supuesto.....""",1443744000,,2126,4.856749311294766

Thanos does a great job, and Benicio Del Toro gives a stunning performance as our titular character, although no character really has an arc.

Well, I ended up sitting in one place for 2 straight hours and was locked into this film - it was pretty damn good, beyond my expectations. Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are excellent in this movie.  Good action and good suspense.  The whole convoy scene was awesome.

Additionally, this movie perpetuates the horrendous tragedy of the single-story that Hollywood tells about Latinos: the dozens of movies and TV shows that portray Latinos are evil people.  Don't get me wrong, there are evil Mexicans, that's a fact. But there are evil people in all races, and it is ONLY Latinos that are ALWAYS portrayed as such by Hollywood.
Hollywood's people continue doing these movies are the ones allowing and enabling Trump, Roger Stone, the Mercers, Jeff Sessions, Sean Hannity and all of their accomplices to stereotype and bully Latinos in America.

(For a variety of reasons, however, I believe that situation is changing.)  My only complaint is the gratuitous female protagonist role, who whines and whimpers throughout the film, and keeps the plot from fully getting realistic and even off the ground.  I like her, but Blunt's role was unnecessary.  Did they feel they needed a lone, naive attractive female to appease/attract audiences?  Not on this kind of film. A littler more action and less boo-hooing from Blunt would have tipped this movie into the five star range.

7436325,5,B015GR8N9Q,"Agree. Brilliant film. True drama which is rare these days.  The dark-doom background sound effect is the best in years.  Very Jaws like.  Keeps you on the edge without evening realizing it.  I enjoy the simplicity.  No over drawn out stupid car chases.  No shoot outs where 2 man kill hundreds without ever getting shot.  I am so tired of today's impossible stunts.  This movie is real.  Powerful - in a true from.  I bet Trump saw this movie and it scared him so bad he felt like we needed to build the wall.  The movie address a lot of truth about drug smuggling.  It's not by those walking across the boarder.  It's brought over in tunnels, small subs, drones etc. The 90's have passed.  A wall is a complete waist of money.  Fence, sure..  Drones watching ever sq mile, hidden motion detectors foor sure.  but to stop the smuggling, you need to not focus and waist money on the wall.  In fact, a crap load comes from Canada where these is no one watching.  Anyway.  Great Movie. I'm stoked about part 2.  I hope they keep the drama restraining from impossible stunt seen in almost every movie these days.",1530835200,,1109,4.445

I ended-up throwing this one into the trash can in disgust after 1/2 hour of trying to watch it.  The girl lead is a little female Nickolas Cage look-a-like that ""emotes "" with troubled expressions and keeps bumming cigarettes. She uses God's Name five times in the first half-hour, which is very offensive in what is still a Christian nation.  The big opener is she is on an FBI SWAT squad that raids a drug house on the border and discovers 15 bodies hidden in the walls behind the sheet-rock.  Maybe these bodies would start to stink in the Arizona heat, you might think !  That is just a hint of what a stinker this film is, despite the multitude of rave reviews.

I bailed-out when our leading lady meets a cowboy in a bar and immediately we switch to her having hot, sweaty sex with the dude.

  HE WAS UNNECESSARILY ADDED TO THE MOVIE TO BE (in my mind) A REAL PAIN IN THE BUTT. Movie coulda been done without him but to his credit hes an amazing actor.
  A scary reality check inside of what our government could or does do. Benecio DEL toro was awesome and what you don't see him do makes this movie what it is along side of josh brolin.

Most people have complained about Emily Blunt, but I actually think the issue was with the character rather than the acting.

7436479,2,B015GR8N9Q,"I thought that Benicio's character (Alejandro) was great, very well played. I didn't like the storyline of the movie, it was somewhat confusing and all over the place. The character of Kate Macer was irrelevant and unnecessary, she didn't really do anything important or have much impact on the movie as a whole except for revealing Alejandro's true intent, which by the way was also off-track and unrelated. They should've included more of Alejandro's background, and who the man at the end was. The opening kidnapping-turned-brutal-homicide scene was unnecessary and it's purpose kind of died out throughout the movie. Overall, it definitely wasn't one of the best movies I've ever seen, one of the only reasons I watched this was because I saw that they were making a sequel and this movie looked kind of interesting, and I thought it would be pretty good, but I was disappointed.",1521590400,,883,4.972972972972973

7436481,5,B015GR8N9Q,"I passed over this a while back thinking it was a ""meh"" movie. I have never been more wrong about a movie in my life. Amazing! I took another look at this, because I saw the trailer for the second one coming out. I don't go to the movie theaters often. Star Wars when it came out again a few years ago. I've not gone since, but I'll be going to see this sequel when it comes out June 29th.

If you're on the fence about this movie, watch 10 mins of it. I don't think there's anyone who could only watch 10 mins of it.

The acting is incredible.
Josh Brolin, come a long way from the Goonies.
Benicio Del Toro, still waiting for him to make a bad movie. Should have known by the fact that he was in it.
Emily Blunt, never really a fan, but she was outstanding in this movie. I did think her questions about the beginning of the operation were a little forced. I think someone who volunteered for this type of thing would go with the flow a bit more.
Jon Bernthal thought he was ""ok"" from the Walking Dead, but he did a great job as well. Was a surprise to see him show up.

If you're like me and waited on this movie, ""YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT""!",1521504000,,1142,3.978165938864629
7436482,4,B015GR8N9Q,Among director Denis Villeneuve's best work. Del Toro and Brolin are believable. The environment tells the story almost on its own. The morally ambiguous tone makes the story far more believable than most big budget flicks these days. Sicario entertains without attempting to entertain.,1521504000,,286,5.5227272727272725

theme it deals with, and that is the narco war in the USA and Mexico borders. It is a glimpse, but through some
really graphic scenes, you are (alas for seconds) transferred to that war, where the line between the law and the
criminals is really blur, and the only logic is that of winning battles and exterminating enemies. So that, the USA
government uses a former cartel assassin to destroy cartel operations in exchange for him getting his revenge (sounds
complex but do not want to spoil things).
Of course the acting is great, even when it is over the top, and the movie goes by before you realize it.
Watch it with caution. Watch it If you like such action films and because a sequel is coming. Do not let kids watch this movie",1520899200,,814,4.469798657718121

times in a movie, no one doesn't get that when someone is doubled over heaving
they are throwing up, we get it, don't need to see the vomit , especially considering
a lot of us watch movies over diner or snacks.
I'm surprised I sat through the first 5 mins, a horrible
piece of garbage imo. I  see lots of 'likes' for this movie, I might have liked it too if they
spent less time giving criminals ideas about stashing bodies, and throwing frequent
projectile vomiting in our faces as if it is somehow entertaining.",1520467200,,760,4.62962962962963

""Sicario"" does not flinch away from the violence, and shows you what lengths the cartels go thru from moving their product to smuggling people and also what the government does too and the corruption on both sides. Benicio Del Toro is amazing as usual in his roles. Brolin and Blunt are really good and good supporting cast with a great film score and amazing visuals to go with it.

Kudos to sound and directing. The camera angles and the music played.....if I could have put a sound to how it really feels, thats what it would sound like.  The moment you are about to do something you probably shouldnt do but have to do and will do because you are the one who does that stuff.

They got it right...your overwhelming sense of mortality, then it evaporates and before you know it you are just working and handling it....then after....numb. When you realize its right here, under your nose....probably said hi to your wife as she shopped for groceries once or twice. If gone through nothing quite like what was in this movie but  what I have gone through, the suspense moments, nailed it.

Watch it alone in the dark....not something to watch with a person who insists on asking you questions the whole time. Like you've seen the movie or something....why are they like that?!",1517875200,,933,4.699386503067485

In doing so he elevated that script to a position of tolerability. That tolerability resurrected this movie to a point at which I was strongly  hoping something more entertaining would happen. That was my mindset, right to the very boring end. Without Mr. Del Toro I am not convinced that this very predictable plot, resorting to realistic violence rather than creative writing, would not have been a ""walk out"" for me, for sure.",1516579200,,735,4.92741935483871

But it goes that extra mile for a movie in that it explores the very different characters and makes them very realistic, not cardboard cut-outs.  Blunt, Del Toro and Brolin all turn in top-notch performances. But my favorite is Brolin, with his straight-faced, dry wit.

It's amazing how over the years you slowly transition from more of Blunt's character to be harder like that of Del Toro's character without blinking an eye.

7436600,5,B015GR8N9Q,"Sicario in Spanish is roughly equivalent to ""hitman"" or ""assassin"" in English. In this film named ""Sicario"", an FBI agent portrayed by Emily Blunt is asked to take part in a government anti-drug ""task force"" run by a shadowy government agent (Josh Brolin) and employing an even more shadowy ""consultant"" plaued by Benicio Del Toro.

Asked to participate in a ""task force"", FBI agent Emily Blunt finds herself out of her league and out of her experience when taking down Mexican cartel drug lords on both sides of the border. Accustomed to the rigid regulations the FBI and domestic law enforcement operates under, she is thrust into situations where the rules are played fast-and-loose and torture and assassination are employed.

The characters are well played by Emily Blunt as the somewhat naive FBI agent and Josh Brolin as the CIA agent commanding the task force. Benicio Del Toro plays the enigmatic ""Alejandro"" who is the ""sicario"" and, although it's never stated clearly, was perhaps once a Mexican prosecutor or law enforcement official whose family was murdered by the drug cartels.

The film is well acted, well directed, with excellent cinematography and score. This is a first-rate thriller in every sense of the word.",1515801600,12,1231,5.054187192118227

The one thing that didn't tick for me was that Del Toro's character said that we were once in a world of sheep, now we are in a world of wolves. I really don't buy that. Look at history, it's full of wolves, perhaps more than now even. The message in No County for Old Men, an equally gritty and dark film, got this point and was probably more true to the real world.

Those factors, and the actors (I very much like Josh Brolin, reminds me of younger Nick Nolte, and Benicio del Toro, reminds me of Latin Brad Pitt), were my favorite parts of this film. I have mixed feelings about the moral equivalence the film seems to suggest between the Mexican drug lords and the Americans going after them. I'm not a fan of Hollywood political correctness that seems to insist on portraying American officials and soldiers too often as criminals or quasi-criminals. SPOILER ALERT, DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME KEY PLOT ELEMENTS. The film tells us that elected American officials have okayed unlawful operations not in order to take down drug cartels, but rather to merge them into a single cartel run by someone whom the US controls. The special operators employ a Columbian who is a super-effective killer of drug lords and became that because his daughter and wife were murdered in disgustingly cruel ways by drug lords. This Columbian intentionally kills women and children in the process of killing a drug lord. At gunpoint he forces an honest FBI agent to sign a paper saying that the operations the FBI agent witnessed were all done legally by the book, even though the FBI agent knows for a fact they went well outside the law. Does the US actually stoop this low in the drug war? Does it operate that far outside its own laws? Everyone will judge that for him-/herself, but I think the threat of punishment tends to restrain US operators from breaking the law to the extent this movie suggests. Then again, war is hell. If one can ignore the politically correct angle, a pretty outstanding film in terms of its portrayal of professional special operators on mission against cartels.",1514764800,3,1870,4.8105590062111805

7436630,4,B015GR8N9Q,"Emily Blunt is an FBI Agent who volunteers to join a task force to take down drug kingpins along the Mexican/United States border. Emily is initially portrayed as a seasoned agent, but the movie makes her a fun-loving, innocent, naive, stupid twit who is also vulnerable. If the task force does not do things following FBI protocols and methods, she is glum, disillusioned and uncooperative. This characterization makes Emily a mannequin for American purity and goodness. Benecio Del Toro informs her at the movies end (something the audience already knows): This is a country of wolves. You need to leave and go to a small town somewhere, not along the border.

Other than Emilys weak character (which is played as written), Sicario is an excellent, violent, gritty film of the border law enforcement arising from drugs, crime and smuggling. Bencio Del Toro and Josh Brolin (balls to the wind) play the leads in the task force. If the scenes filmed have happened or may happen one day, Sicario is a deeply disturbing movie. [It was written and filmed during the Obama Administration; nothing Trump did helped produce or promote this movie.] Most Americans are not ready to face the reality - there will be actions and occurrences that must be overlooked.

Emily Blunts character should have been written differently. Allow her to learn from the experiences that character has in the movie. She does not like what the task force is doing; she makes mistakes. At the end she must have some fight (dignity, integrity and honesty) in her. In the confrontation Bencio Del Toro begins. She says, I didn't do very well. He tells her she is too innocent and naive and he uses a line (carelessly disclosed earlier in the script) You are too much like my daughter. Emily already knows his daughter was killed by drug overlords. Del Toro gives his country of wolves comments. She is defiant. He says, If you want to tell your FBI superiors about everything and about all your mistakes, it is up to you. He leaves. Emily stews; she has decisions to make about the reality she has experienced and the reality Americans believe is true. In essence Emily can represent all Americans going forward.",1514592000,,2183,4.834224598930481
7436631,4,B015GR8N9Q,"""Nothing will make sense to your American ears, and you will doubt everything that we do, but in the end you will understand.""

As they say in suspense shorts, ""Wait for it"".

On reflection over night, two points stand out. First, the technical aspects of the camera work are absolutely stunning -- the night visions, the shots from space, the ""normal"" views of landscapes and cities -- kudos and a reminder to see Renner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hurt-Locker/dp/B0030MKGKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hurt Locker</a>&nbsp;again.

Second, Emily Blunt has been criticized for being cast, and for how she played, the role of Karen. To me, this was a perfect choice on both accounts. Basically she represents what Americans think and do about the drug trade -- terrible, unlawful, should be stopped -- but in fact like Karen we do nothing really to make things right -- no matter how many times Karen (and we) have a chance to do so.

The point is made by the wife of the slain cop while taking her son to play soccer at the end of the film.

Great photography, believable acting, suspenseful -- very enjoyable, and very frightening -- this reality is right on our border, and our demand for drugs makes it all happen.

We are supposed to believe someone who is an experienced team leader on an FBI SWAT TEAM(Emily Blunt), a SWAT team that is based out of an Arizona field office where they mainly do high risk cartel warrants and entries somehow gets the dream assignment of her life and gets to work with CIA SAD/FBI Task Force, and acts like she is somehow shocked at how the United States government operates overseas and with the cartels? This is one of the dumbest and most illogical things I've ever seen and even writing this review is making my head hurt.

  Civilians will just like the fact there was a couple of average shootout scenes and that it had ""tension"" and I guess that makes it okay that they completely wrote a garbage story that makes ZERO sense for anyone in a tactical profession. This should have focused on the two great actors Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin and gotten rid of Emily Blunt's terrible character. She ruined this entire movie. The fact that this has 4/12 stars is a joke. I guess when people watch this for free it makes it a lot better, but I actually paid for this garbage.",1509321600,,1319,4.510460251046025

Benicio's acting is top notch as is Emily Blunt's and Josh Brodin's.  Actually I can't think of a single poor performance from any actor in the entire film.  Again the movie is very violent so definitely not for children.

7436789,3,B015GR8N9Q,"As an exercise in ""cinma du look"", in concert with an ""exprience du son"", Sicario certainly has its appeal. However, the movie was not superior to the script by Taylor Sheridan, in which the character of Alejandro, played by Benicio del Toro, was much more explicitly developed, so that his motivation, purpose, methodology and means of evaluation were clear. In the movie, this was subordinated to the Emily Blunt's Kate character, so as to make her, almost non-existent development, the centre of attention. A deficiency of which, is probably why her character, and she, has been excised from Soldado (Sicario 2). Both the script and the movie allude to a number of important moral and ethical issues, via which to create a picture that is bigger in scope and consequences, than is usual for the simpler high-concept Hollywood movie that Sicario, as a movie, is closer to, than its ambitions, as a script. In sum: Sicario is an example of a Hollywood that has yet to successfully integrate empty spectacle with the art of drama.",1503878400,,1030,4.8914285714285715

7436805,2,B015GR8N9Q,"with almost 18k reviews, i don't expect mine to make an impact or even ever get read, but i would like to put it in writing nevertheless. sicario is a great movie - the photography is beautiful, the audio, every aspect of it, is outstanding, the acting is good. it is a wonderful experience of sensory stimulation, and the movie magic takes the viewer all the way from the first moment to the very last, not giving them much opportunity to think about the movie

the problem with sicario starts AFTER watching the movie. when you mull over the storyline, when you try to digest your input, put it all together, synthetise. that's when sicario falls apart into tiny little pieces. tiny little pieces, seriously. the story has gaping plot holes that are disgraceful to a movie so well produced. the characters upon closer consideration often do not make much sense. you realize this movie pretends to be cerebral, but it is only attitudinizing. i don't want to get into details, because it is really not worth the time. i regret trying to understand this movie as a smart movie, and trying to figure things out. this movie is a great piece of entertainment with a shambolic storyline. seriously, shambolic

so my advice, if you ever get to watch this movie - enjoy the sensory experience. the beautiful wide shots, the slow motion shots, the incredible sound engineering, the photography - and stop right there. do not try to understand anything. this movie is an intellectually meaningless piece of beautiful visuals and audio. let it please your eyes and ears, and let your mind sleep through it",1503100800,,1595,4.754512635379061

7436807,5,B015GR8N9Q,"That quote is one of the things Alejendro (Benicio Del Toro's character) says to Kate Macer (Emily Blunt's character) at the beginning of the film and it really sums up this film perfectly as the viewer is basically in the same position as Kate in regards to understanding what is going on in this film and as a result, you really do question everything that is going on and you really don't understand everything until the end. Honestly, this is one of the best drug related movies I have seen in a very long time!!

I don't want to give any spoilers away as to do so would be a crime to the people that haven't seen this film yet. Its got an absolutely fantastic script and the directing and cinematography are both absolutely off the hook brilliant. One of the things that stood out the most for me was just how amazing the control of tension was in this film. There is a scene in the beginning where the team crosses over to Juarez Mexico to pick up a high level drug detainee and brings him back across to the US. It was roughly 10-15 minutes of the movie and the tension in that scene just builds and builds throughout the entire scene. It was just a masterfully crafted sequence of the film, in every single aspect of film making, and the film only gets better and better from there.

The cinematography in general was just absolutely brilliant throughout the entire film. The car scene I just mentioned in the beginning, the amazing aerial photography shot on the border and in the city of Juarez, and in particular the use of satellite imagery, drone imagery, and the use of night vision photography towards the end of the film. They even use security camera footage. Its just a masterful blending of a whole slew of different photographic tools and styles and it really helps give the film a sense of realism and really helps put you in the shoes of Kate and the team. I'm a professional photographer so I tend to focus on cinematography more than your average film goer, but this cinematography is so well done that I think most movie goers that appreciate a beautifully shot film will be talking about just how amazing this aspect of this film was when the credits start rolling.

And the casting is just top notch. Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro all give top notch performances. Benicio Del Toro's performance is definitely the best of the 3, but that's mostly because his character was the most interesting of the 3. There is a lot of mystery and intrigue behind his character and you don't find out the real story behind Alejando until the end of the film and Del Toro does a brilliant job with the role. You can see Kate trying to figure out just who Alejendro is from the very beginning of the film and were only given small bits of information on his character as the film goes on. One of my favorite aspects of Josh Brolin's character, Matt Graver, was just how much he enjoys sticking it to the bad guys. He is a man that truly loves what he is doing and you see him smiling in many scenes where most people wouldn't be. And Emily Blunt definitely holds her own. All 3 play off each other really well and the result is one of the best acted films I have seen in awhile.

If there was one weakness in regards to the casting it was with Kate's partner Reggie. Its not that he did a bad job, its just everyone else did such an amazing job that his character just doesn't hold up and feels kinda boring. Fortunately, even when he is there, the focus is usually on one of the other team members so his performance really doesn't hurt the film at all. Again, his performance just wasn't up to par with the rest of the performances in the film.

All in all, Sicario is just a brilliant film. It has a fantastic script, great casting, top notch performances, and some of the best cinematography I have seen in some time. It has action, tension, intrigue, and it has some great twists and a great ending. Ultimately, this film was a very different take on the whole ""war on drugs"" genre of films.

Definitely a solid 9/10 for me!!",1503100800,,4057,4.4171122994652405
