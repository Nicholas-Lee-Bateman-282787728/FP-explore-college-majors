7554379,5,B018TA0UOS,"I was pleased with this film. I prefer films like this, those where the characters and the tale told are in the forefront. It is a fresh and poignant presentation.
The simplicity of certain scenes produces an intimacy devoid of distraction; while the complexity of emotional content in other scenes stirs one's feeling to the core.
At times the film's style is reminiscent of the stage (drama) - how focused an audience becomes upon each character.
Many familiar faces among the cast, but none overshadowed any scene.
This work produces a snapshot in time, a picture of the mind well worth the view.",1458000000,2,599,4.825242718446602
7554380,5,B018TA0UOS,"Based on a true story...  This is a good movie.  Different from other slavery movies that only show the side where African Americans cannot or will not succeed in any attempt to escape such an abominable & repugnant time in American history.
The character ""Big Ben"" did succeed plus many others that you must READ about.  The media will definitely not display any consummate of African Americans, only the negative.
I watch a ton of slavery movies just to see how producers display those times.  Also, to remind me of where my ancestors have been & died for (uplift the race, not disgrace).  This helps me to remind my teenage son (whom is on the honor roll) of why self pride is important.  Unfortunately, we as African Americans cannot look to the outside world for inspiration.  We as a people must be our own inspiration, represent ourselves in a positive manner & take pride in our differences & resilience.
I think most of these movies are meant to scar us, & make us feel inferior.  But one must use this as a guidance of how far we've come & how far we must continue for equality.
Both my husband, son & myself thought this was a refreshing role from what is normally perceived about black men.  The men were not weak & submissive.  They fought back, but were killed of course.  AA's have been through hell, but we as a people are still standing.  Stay Proud!

7554382,5,B018TA0UOS,Totally amazing movie!! I love it!! Definitely recommend!! ,1504224000,,59,6.375
7554383,5,B018TA0UOS,"Just saw this movie and it was powerful. I urge everyone to see it, and just think its based on a true story.  I'm going to make sure I go visit the museum that has the rich history of the society that housed slaves and free slaves as well, especially the church that was founded bye slaves or free slaves.  The price of freedom came with a price=our bloodshed.  It's like the movie said so well, Live free running or live free to your death. It also shows how everyone black or white worked together to end this horrible bondage of slavery, because white people took risk and some of them even died at the hands of freedom for us as well, but it was our people that payed the horrible price of being sold, kidnap, rape, etc, And still push forward for freedom.",1500508800,,761,4.270833333333333
7554384,5,B018TA0UOS,Good movie.  I used it for grade 7 students after their study of Frederick Douglass and slavery.,1498262400,,96,4.647058823529412

7554389,4,B018TA0UOS,"I enjoyed the movie, a simple but powerful telling of the hardship that slaves had to go through to get their freedom. It makes me not want to take for granted all that I have.",1483401600,,176,4.057142857142857
7554390,5,B018TA0UOS,"Be still my heart. I watched and saw this movie (unknowingly) just before the loss of mom who was born in 1921. She was born and raised in the South and some of the things she shared truly resonated with and within this movie. A movie very simply yet elegantly done. (what do you mean?) What does a person really need to make a movie? A story that needs or wants to be told, the ability to captivate, characters and perhaps props. Respectfully, in embracing our differences I for one do not need colorful or fancy back drops or locale or anything else to look at in a movie, I just want to get into the cast and feel the depth of character all else falls to the wayside. North Star fulfills and more as you hope for a victorious journey or dare I say pray?",1480636800,,756,4.184931506849315

7554399,4,B018TA0UOS,"Excellent movie about a very sensitive issue, American slavery. It tells the truth that not all white people were bad, and not all blacks were good. I constantly see the same thing today where blacks sell out their own people for money. As an African American, I really like these movies because it helps me to understand myself and my roots. The struggle goes on.",1466035200,,364,4.615384615384615

8742918,5,B018TA0UOS,"Having grown up in the Buckingham area, I found this movie so historically fascinating. As teenagers, wed drive up gravity hill and creep each other out with urban legends about the church. Knowing the background and facts about the Underground Railroad, Northern Light and the part my hometown played helping runaways slaves is a gift. So grateful for the production of this movie. The acting was wonderful. Loved it.",1535587200,,418,5.072463768115942
