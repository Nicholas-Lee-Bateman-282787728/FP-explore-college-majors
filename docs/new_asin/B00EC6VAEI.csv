8603667,4,B00EC6VAEI,"Having purchased and reviewed the previous film (Suzune Genesis) several months ago, finally got around to getting the sequel. It is just as good as the first one and Dr. Suzune must fight against her father, the scientist responsible for the outbreak from Genesis. The film starts off immediately after the first though it does give a brief synopsis for those that did not see it. She and the son of the chairman of the evil corporation are trapped in an abandoned factory/hospital and must find a way out. The chairman, the villain behind it all, is betrayed by the real mastermind- the Drs. long lost father. Along the way we find the real purpose behind everything- the scientist wants to create a new breed of super human to supplant the human race.

Dr. Suzune also comes into contact with a hybrid clone of herself. All told, the Parasite Doctor films are good fare as long as the viewer understands that Japanese science fiction films have different aesthetics than North American. The dvd cover actually shows only the good doctor and the one showing is for the instant video version. For fans of Kantetsu the Frog, alas he has only minor scenes here. Enjoy!",1410480000,4,1167,4.720588235294118
