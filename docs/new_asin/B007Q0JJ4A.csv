5104861,5,B007Q0JJ4A,"The movie's theme is about a mafia-type man who controls and manipulates crime in a city.  The man finds Christ but then has to deal with his rebellious son who wants to continue in the underworld, leading the crime family.  A Christian group comes to town to hold rally crusades and the crime syndicate tryes to stop the ministry.
The acting was actually quite good.  I am not completely on board with some of Ken Copeland's past theological statements.  However, I can respect the quality of his acting and accent, as well as purpose in sharing Christ.  The movie was good quality and can be a fine evangelism tool (just see caveat below).  Different races and ethnicities were portrayed in a positive manner.
The movie does show occasional drugs and violence, and a dysfunctional family, hence its PG 13 rating.",1399334400,2,814,4.7785714285714285
5104862,5,B007Q0JJ4A,"Any movie that points someone to Christ is a great movie, salvation is what it's all about, Jesus died for us.",1379894400,2,110,4.285714285714286
5104863,5,B007Q0JJ4A,"Storyline and music were excellent...it was a cross between watching a reality/behind the scene type of movie with a documentary due to the real nature of the lives portrayed.
Great acting...
It had drugs and gang behavior within the storylines...not for age 12 and under IMO
Big impact in terms of not limiting who the Lord can and cannot reach!!",1378166400,,347,4.8
5104864,1,B007Q0JJ4A,"My family and I have seen a lot of Christian movies as well as other movies.  This one was so bad, that it was almost embarrassing to watch til the end.  It was so Unrealistic and corny.  I love Kennith Copeland. I bought the movie through their ministry. The accents were horrible and over done. I don't want to be too negative, because I love the man of God, but I also love a good christian movie as well..like the ENCOUNTER; TO SAVE A LIFE (teen/2 cuss words); COURAGEOUS; the MARK; UPSIDE(teen); ABRAHAM; DAVID; FIREPROOF; & so many others. I'm going to try to sell at our next yard sale for two dollars. Also,I don't think this a good witnessing tool.",1366675200,2,657,4.413223140495868
5104865,5,B007Q0JJ4A,"Kenneth Copeland does a outstanding job as a sinister mob boss who becomes a Christian and leaves his old life and the city he dominated to his son.  The story is mostly about how his son chooses the old mob life and is not about to be threatened by some do-gooder Christians trying to bring in an evangelistic rally, which he will stop at nothing to run them out of town.  This is a very believeable story of drug addiction and the workings of crime in people's lives--white, black, Hispanic, all. But it also shows why Salvation is so needed and changes things.  The end almost brings one to tears.  We liked the movie a lot.",1357689600,6,627,4.379310344827586

8520982,2,B007Q0JJ4A,"Though no where near the quality of Flywheel, Courageous, etc, the music and rap on stage at the end was the most pitiful I've ever heard. They could at least have used a real (black) Christian rapper (I'm white). Oh well, no doubt many overlooked this failure and were blessed. I say with Paul, ""Whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached, and therein I rejoice.""",1463097600,,373,4.582089552238806

8520985,2,B007Q0JJ4A,"I know this is a B rated movie but it was very poorly put together. No one except Kenneth Copeland did any ""acting"" and the good message it tried to send was hindered by the way it was put together. Just need a little more experience in the film industry before making a movie.",1420588800,,277,4.148148148148148
