348021,5,6301666569,"I thought I was the only person alive that absolutely loves BTTF,BTTF2 and BTTF3! I am 33 years old and own the movies. I watch the movies about 4-6 times a year and never get sick of them. I just love the story. Its every  boys dream to have an adventure and to feel like you have made an impact on  life. I was 17 in 1985 and that is how old the character Marty McFly is in  the movie. I related to it then and watching the movie now at the age of 33  is a great trip back in time for me. I am glad to see that so many people  love the movies as much as I do. It does make me sad to think the adventure  stopped with Doc flying away on the time train! I like to think that the  adventures continued we just didn't get to see them! Well... off to the  psychiotrist(sp) appointment! (sad that movies can affect peoples lives  with so much impact huh!) I even find myself wanting to buy a 1985 Toyota  pickup truck 4x4 based on the movie! I can't afford a Delorian!",934588800,,964,3.922680412371134

348246,4,6301666569,"Released in 1989, Back to the Future Part II stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen from 1985 who travels to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) on his time machine. When they return to 1985 they discover that an item was inadvertently taken from 2015 and brought to 1955, which changed history and made Hill Valley a dystopia. So they frantically venture back to 1955 to try to correct the problem.  Crispin Glover & Lea Thompson play Martys parents while Thomas F. Wilson plays the villain, Biff. Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Martys girlfriend, but shes asleep most of the movie.

This is almost as good as the first movie, but the goofy tone of the first act throws it off, although its action-packed. The next two acts are better as Marty & Doc go back in time and cleverly try to fix things. While the plot is way more complicated than the first film its surprisingly easy to follow (Doc effectively explains the logistics in one scene). However, its mandatory that you watch the first movie to fully appreciate this one.

It can be argued that the movie was overly optimistic about the future (that is, 2015), but it was surprisingly accurate with some things, like video phones and, to some degree, hover-boards. But since the future shown in the movie (2015) is a timeline manipulated by the protagonists its an ALTERNATE reality and not necessarily the way things panned out in reality. It was Doc himself who invented the technology for flying automobiles since he already created the flying DeLorean in the first movie.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Oxnard, Monrovia, Arleta, Whittier, Baldwin Park, South Pasadena, Pasadena, Universal City and Los Angeles, California. DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis. WRITERS: Zemeckis & Bob Gale.

348367,5,6301666569,"This movie Back to the Future Part II takes a very somber view of what happens when Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Llloyd) transport from 1985 to 2015. For one thing, both the characters of McFly and Doc Brown have to try to stop a Presidential Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) from turning the country into a dystopian society filled with extreme economic unrest for people outside of the government. One of the other reasons why the time travel is shown to be essential in this episode is due to the fate of McFlys parents lives (played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) hanging in the balance if they are not able to stop the Biffs from 2015 and 1955. The date November 12, 1955 is significant for the characters of Mcfly and Doc Brown to travel back to in order to intervene in Bifs life before he has the chance to use his knowledge for evil/sinister ends. Additionally, they have to find a way to go ahead and include McFlys girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Elizabeth Shue) in their plans without her remembering too much. Of course, there is much more to this fiction time travel movie (as well as other characters and actresses involved such as Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing a brief cameo of Douglas J. Needles). I understand that Back to the Future Part II is an entertaining and fictional time travel movie. Additionally, even as someone who wanted Hillary Clinton to become President, Im hopeful that the dystopian potential reality reflected in this movie never happens in real life (because a less than ideal outcome in real-life would affect all supporters regardless of political affiliation).",1478908800,,1635,4.76056338028169

348499,2,6301666569,"A rather embarrassing and unnecessary sequel. It's a painfully unfunny rehash of the first movie. Nearly everything from top to bottom in this sequel failed to live up to the original. And there was never meant to be a sequel anyway, but it was made because of the money and that's made clear from the first 15 minutes. Perfect example of how to execute this concept with the original, and how not to do it with Part II. The acting is poor, the plot is uninspired and not as exciting as the first. The whole thing just seems thrown together without caring about making any logical sense. It's a bad script, plain and simple. The plot is so convoluted and absurd. Marty has to help his son who looks exactly like him and is also of course played by Michael J. Fox. And the daughter is also played by Michael J. Fox. The characters are also in obvious old people makeup. Are you kidding me? This is ridiculous. The depiction of the future is also pretty ridiculous. Flying cars in 2015? Simply not a believable sequel. It's like it was made as fan fiction. Personally I always hated part III as well because they go back in time to the Wild West and that's just stupid. Both parts II and III are out of place and unnecessary. Not even Doc could save this turkey. When I think of bad sequels, this one definitely comes to mind. A complete and total waste of time, I'll be sticking with the brilliant original.",1470528000,,1406,4.411538461538462

And sharing them with the younger generation of my family not only brings back memories it creates new one with the grand kids. There are just so many great movies but the classic family ones are my all time favorites with out a doubt. I have shared them with my own kids growing up and now I am sharing them with my grand kids. I remember watching them when I was younger and I am so happy to have them on Amazon so I will not lose them, no figure prints and cleaning them and they can never break. I can watch them anywhere with the kids on my laptop with my Amazon. This is great for the vacation nights when it is time to settle down. I buy all my movies this way now, they take up no room in the house, no finding the wrong movie in the case, there are so may benefits this way.

349360,3,6301666569,"Lots of people look back on this film with nostalgia, but I'm not one of them. As a child of the 80's I remember seeing the original Back to the Future in theaters. Now of course that film took 1980's viewers who had grown up in the 1950's on a nostalgia trip, while drawing in kids with the sci-fi aspect and humor. Of course I can appreciate that film more now as an adult. I ""missed out"" on the heavily hyped sequel with all its ""futuristic"" technology, but knew all about it thanks to many promotional specials on TV, adverts and so on. I felt like I knew the film even though I didn't see it until perhaps a decade after its release, on VHS. While it wasn't the blatant remake-posing-as-a-sequel that Terminator 2 was to The Terminator, it was much like how Return of the Jedi was a bit of a ""remake"" of the original Star Wars. While I'm a big fan of both T2 and ROTJ, I'm not a huge fan of Back to the Future Part II. I actually enjoyed Part 3 a lot more. Part II changed the personalities of characters, got rid of characters, replaced the actors who played previous characters, and while the portions showing ""2015"" were fun, in that over-the-top 80's way, there wasn't much to the film to make it compelling. I guess it is part of the ""Back to the Future"" canon, but it's the weakest of the three films, and legitimate criticisms have been leveled at it from people like ""Confused Matthew"" on the web elsewhere that I won't retread. And while I don't agree with everything that fellow says, I do agree with the sentiment that this movie works best if you haven't seen the others in awhile, as opposed to being part of a series marathon.

While it was ""cool"" to live through the period of ""history"" that this movie forecasted (knowing full well the filmmakers didn't seriously think we'd have all that technology at the level portrayed in the film by this year), it's no different than living through other ""future"" timelines proposed by various films. I think it's only being recognized now because so many adults remember Doc Brown and Marty McFly (played by two actors who haven't had many big hits since that film franchise ended) and 80's nostalgia.

The reality is that most of the ""predictions"" from BTTFP2 have appeared elsewhere, from comic books, to cartoons, tv shows and other movies. Lots of the predictions were the same sorts of jokes and gags that were appearing in Bugs Bunny cartoons in the 1940's & 50's (ie: contemporary celebrity is still doing what they always do, politics still ridiculous, etc). Culture is the same just bigger, faster and more gaudy. If anything ""The Jetsons"" and ""Star Trek"" predicted just as many things for today as this film did, and no sane person believes the creators of those shows was some true visionary prophet. Right?

This is not a terrible film, but it's inferior to the other two, IMHO.",1447286400,,2851,4.553606237816764

I'm amazed how things get done in Hollywood with all the egos in the entertainment industry having to work together. But what a fun movie this was, it seems like so much fun but it's a lot of work creating a great movie... (even a flop movie takes a lot of work too...). On another note, some parts of Las Vegas on the Vegas Strip kind of look like you're in the future envisioned by Back To The Future... (minus the traffic jams).",1445904000,,557,4.166666666666667

352397,5,6301666569,"Except, of course, in it's predictions of the future.  To be fair, no one really expected the Back to the Future franchise to be hard futurism.  Well, okay, a few people did, possibly ironically. And also, some of the future tech did actually become a reality.  Our hover boards don't work on water either.

When this movie came out, along with the third film, some people labeled them as second rate cash ins.  But having just watched it again, I would say that this movie is about as good of a sequel as you can expect.  It did tread some of the same ground as the first film, but it did so in a clever way.  And it also expanded the overall story.  And it was just plain entertaining to watch.  I really did enjoy revisiting this film.

The basic plot has them going to the future, to the past, and to an alternative present, which makes for a very varied set of locations to work with, even though it's technically the same area.  And you get to see different versions of the characters in different circumstances.  It makes for some really fun storytelling situations.

Really, overall, I quite enjoyed watching this again.  I'd daresay it's actually improved with age, even in spite of it's recent resurgence in popular culture considering the timeline in which the future portions of the film occur in.  So it's on the recommended pile for me, even if you haven't seen the first movie.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1445731200,2,1427,4.515625

It's so fun to see ""the butterfly affect"" happening. I recommend seeing the trilogy about 3 times to really get the most out of it, including how we thought the future would be in the 1980's and the way things are now. In this particular ""Part II"", they go to OCT. 21, 2015 (side note: my birthday). Watch to see what things are simply silly and overthought. Unfortunately, some things, you just kinda have to go with it, similar to the Austin Powers movies.

They felt the need to hit you with every plot point like a hard slap in the face.  Nothing is subtle.  If you miss anything, you must not be paying attention.  Everything is overacted, and melodramatic.  Every character is a caricature.  The worst part is that I never got the feeling that the writer or director were trying to make a movie so bad that it was good, like we're all in on the joke that they weren't even attempting to be serious.

This movie should be insulting to anyone with an IQ over 60.",1445644800,,717,4.213235294117647

It's a very creative story that retreads familiar ground in new and exciting ways while setting itself up perfectly for the inevitable sequel. It ramps up the stakes and the action without losing its charm, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Perhaps its only crime is in not being as self-contained as the first film, as the cliffhanger ending leaves some minor points open for the next movie to wrap up. Still, a solid and enjoyable film either way. Highly recommended, especially to fans of the first film.",1445558400,,576,4.601941747572815

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

356246,5,6301666569,I watched this earlier in the week because of the date obviously but this has been one of my favorite movies since I was a kid. Being older there are some elements that I have a problem with (like the rich version of Marty's parents still living in the same house they did when Marty's family was poor but in the Biff version of 1985 a black family now lives there because it's a garbage neighborhood and that feels racist) but then I'm like it's a movie so I need to chill out. If you haven't any of these movies definitely watch the first one and then this one...at least for the chuckle at how they thought the current era would look around 25 years ago.,1445558400,2,657,4.222222222222222

357302,5,6301666569,"Well, as most of you probably know -- October 21st, 2015 was dubbed as the official ""Back To The Future"" Day!  This was the very day that Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown travelled from 1985 to 2015 in a flying DeLorean!!  :)  Now, we actually ARE in the year 2015, and some of the predictions that the writers made actually came true -- while others did not.

Hoverboard -- there is a version of the hoverboard that is currently being made in Silicon Valley (California).  The movie version of the Hoverboard was auctioned off in London for $33,000.

Automated gas pumps -- these actually DO exist, but they are in Poland.

Flying cars -- current prototypes are being developed in Vienna (Austria), but is not known whether it will become mass produced.  Current asking price is $250,000.

Voice control command -- can be used on Smartphones, HDTV's, tablets, or other appliances.  Can also be used in newer vehicles.  Furthermore, you can even use fingerprint identification to pay your bills (the ""selfie pay"" is currently being developed).  Sadly, doors STILL have doorknobs, so you cannot open them with just your thumb.  :(

Drones DO exist!!!  Virtual reality (holographic?) glasses also exist!!

Self-parking/self-driving -- currently being developed and may become reality by no later than 2020.

Live chat in real time via video/television screens -- currently used via Skype or other means of social media.

Now, here's what did NOT happen:

No ""Queen"" Diana -- Princess Diana passed away in 1997.

No Michael Jackson holograms or automated waitresses -- M.J. passed away in 2009.

No dehydrated pizzas (""Hydrate Level 4, please!!"") -- cannot use today's ovens to make instant pizzas, at least not yet.

No Pepsi Perfect, but you CAN construct your very own bottle from the movie using a homemade kit, and fill it with your favorite drink!

Other parts of the movie I also really loved, such as what happened to Griff and his gang before they were arrested; and poor Marty McFly not knowing what happened when he returned to the ""alternate"" 1985 and Hill Valley was completely different.  I hope that all of you enjoyed watching the BTTF trilogy.  For those of you that are truly invested in the franchise, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd had an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel live just last night, looking as great as ever!  I'm also buying today's USA Today paper because there is a whole page dedicated to the movie.

I can remember as a kid watching Part II and imagining what the year 2015 would be like. The movie made it feel so real. I never get tired of this movie or any of the trilogy.

While the first movie runs like a brand-new clocktower, and the third movie stands alone well as a Western parody, the second act in the BTTF trilogy is awfully forced with a lot of business to get the actors from point a to point b. It's got some nice moments, like Marty's visit to the dark alternate present, but the way poor Elizabeth Shue is shunted around like so much unwanted baggage pretty well sums up what this film deserves---to be put in a closet and forgotten.",1445472000,,485,4.46067415730337

There is a lot of question I have since in 1989 I was 5 years old :) and I wasn't living In california like Know... If you see the point of the movie is trying to show us the future in 2015 but the past timeline was changed by the old man so but the Question Is The past that was changed when they where in 2015 Does the Sensor Skate Board was existing  at that time? I've seen that... If the movie was filmed in 1989 and they where in 2015 How they showed the modern life that we are living at that time? I am sure that the people at that time (1989) where thinking this is a Science Fiction but what about US in 2015?",1445472000,,839,3.877906976744186

Since then I have nurtured a true love of film through out my life. It is my view that the ""Back to the Future"" series is a masterpiece of film for entertainment. It does not try to dazzle you with cinematography or tap into any deep emotions, it is whiz of plot and story that grabs you early and keeps up the action.

  Technically flawless, well paced, and acted to comic perfection by it's recurring cast of characters; it is always satisfying to watch. 50 years from now, people will still be watching this. 100 years from now people will still be watching this. It will be carried in to space, people will watch this on Mars.",1445385600,,805,4.248366013071895

358370,4,6301666569,"It took four years before audiences were able to see Back to the Future Part II, however it took me almost 20 years to fully appreciate how Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis were able to return to the original film but seeing it in another angle while going to the future and an alternate universe all the result of time travel.

The clamor of fans, as well as a bottom-line driven film studio, brought about sequel to the 1985 classic that began just where its predecessor left off with Marty, Doc, and Jennifer in the flying DeLorean headed to 2015.  In the future, Marty must save his kids from ruining their lives but in exploring Hill Valley of 2015 he gets the attention of old Biff who realizes that Doc invented a time machine.  Marty and Doc rescue Jennifer from the future McFly home during which old Biff steals the DeLorean and changes history, which Marty and Doc realize when they return to a dystopian 1985 Hill Valley.  The duo travel back to 1955 to undo the damage old Biff had done.  The electrifying ending sets up the trilogys final installment to perfection.

When I first watched Back to the Future Part II in the early 90s, I only so-so liked it because unlike the original and the final films it was so dark.  Even with the cool future predicted in the film with hoverboards and hover-converted cars, the dystopia 1985 and its shadow over the rest of the film was a downer for my middle school self.  However now that Ive grown up and have a better appreciation of narrative flow that Gale and Zemeckis created in this middle installment and reinforce the dangers of time travel.

If you were like and felt that Part II was always the weakest of the trilogy, look again and appreciate what was accomplished in this film.",1445385600,,1740,4.515923566878981

358476,5,6301666569,"With today being the iconic date that Doc Brown and Marty McFly head into the future, I had to watch the series. Welcome to the future! :)

There is nothing more iconic than the Back to the Future Trillogy. From Biff calling people Butthead, to Marty McFly never stooping to answer to being called chicken, to all the anachronisms of the future and past, Back to the Future is one of the classics. Every part of this story is wrapped up in itself to all three parts of the movie. The only question left is: How did Marty McFly meet Doc Brown in the first place?

There's not much else to review about this trilogy, being that if you haven't seen it by now, what planet are you from?",1445385600,2,682,4.27906976744186
358477,5,6301666569,Happy Back to the Future Day!  10-21-2015 4:29 p.m.  I have loved these movies since I was a kid.  I remember we had a special day in middle school when we were allowed to watch it in class and then do a report on it. Its clear it was always meant to be a trilogy and it is an enduring story that will last the ages.  While not everything it predicted has come true its amazing how much has. I am thrilled to have enjoyed it so long and that my kids enjoy it as well.  I will be watching it again tonight!  Welcome to the future.  It is finally here!,1445385600,3,550,3.900900900900901
358478,5,6301666569,Classic film.  Forever my favorite trilogy.  Will continue to watch it frequently.  Just a classic.,1445385600,2,99,5.466666666666667
358479,5,6301666569,"THE FUTURE IS HERE!!!

It's October 21, 2015! I have been waiting for this day since 1989. And now it's here! I assume my hoverboard will be delivered any minute now...

When this movie came out to follow up what's become an absolute sci fi classic it wasn't widely revered as a good movie. It was largely underappreciated by fans who didn't feel it lived up to the awesomeness of the first film. People in 1989 were just wrong. This movie is awesome.

The future, as depicted by BTTF Part 2 obviously didn't live up to the predictions. No flying cars. No dehydrated pizzas. The Cubs are down 0-3 in the NLCS as of today an unlikely to fulfill that prophecy. But the movie is still relevant as a 'future setting' when watching in 2015 because the predictions are so outlandish that they still look futuristic today.

As for the time travel plot, it's way more interesting than the time travel scenarios of either Part 1 or 3. In those movies the time travel is a simple 1 stop trip to the past then back to the present. In Part 2 it's to the future, then back to the wrong present, then back to the original past then back to the correct present. That's heavy!

I still like Part 1 as the overall better film. But the time travel situation is far more elaborate in Part 2 and it doesn't get enough credit for that.

It's just a good fun sci fi movie that has held up well over time.",1445385600,4,1382,4.296153846153846
358480,5,6301666569,"Well, the kids nowadays don't have hoverboards, the cops don't have sick bikes, we certainly don't have flying cars, MJ isn't alive anymore, I haven't seen a newspaper in a while, we don't have a consumer grade trash to fuel converter (I wish!), inflation isn't as bad today as the movie makes it (haha), we don't dress like goons (most of us anyways) and a myriad of other ridiculous things depicted...

This years 2015 may look similar To 1989's 2015 as 1985 set in the year 2015 of this year or 1985 of this year as opposed to 30 years ago which could very well be 1885 for all we care to know. or this could still be 1995 in my opinion but I prefer to see it as 2045 this year because I'd Like To run for The white House as National Director of the US Running The The Constitutionalist Party And creating My Own Time Reality Movie Like Biff Tannen Or Trump or The Great One Where I am ALWAYS Right And ALWAYS Impossible to debate Against any topic like I am in the present year thus!!! The Sole Point Is WE have liberty to call out time and make it righteous And reinvent History and rewrite our future for the year we live in is any year we want in God's Kingdom So Lets See It as God Sees It and make it the past present and future at once this year 1990, 1985 this year's 1985, 8514 or 2045 vs 2005 and vice versa!!! The End!! God Bless and Excelsior On this Moment!!!! Amen!!!",1444780800,,1817,4.315789473684211

360959,5,6301666569,"When it comes to sequels, conventional wisdom is they are pale shadows of the original.  And most of the time, that is true.  But Back to the Future Part II manages to be one of those films that revisits the original while still being lots of fun.

The movie picks up with the final scene of the first movie as Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has returned to 1985 to take Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to the future.  Along for the ride is Marty's girlfriend Jennifer Parker (now played by Elisabeth Shue).  They've gone to the future to stop Marty's kids from making huge mistakes that spiral the family out of control.

But the trip to the future also lets bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) do something that completely changes the time line.  Leaving Jennifer in an alternative 1985, the two must travel back in time to keep everything from unraveling.  Can they correct the damages to the timeline without causing any more?

This film sounds very confusing on paper, but it actually works quite well when you watch it.  You're able to follow everything that happens and everything makes sense.  Well, there's one exception, but even then I let it go because the film is so much fun.  As is always the case with time travel, if you think about it too hard, you wind up wrapping yourself up in contradictions and knots.  But if you just sit back and enjoy, you'll find it's plenty of fun.

During the future section (set in 2015), there are plenty of great jabs at the 80's.  They still hold up even now.  And I'm so ready for hover boards and flying cars.  If only, right?

What is brilliant about this film is the final act.  It takes place during the final act of the first film.  We get to see the action from a different point of view.  No, it doesn't track with the original completely since they hadn't planned on a sequel during filming, but they do a pretty impressive job of weaving the new action around the old, and combining the two just ups the suspense.

The acting is uniformly perfect.  Michael J. Fox not only plays Marty, but his two kids as well.  Thomas F. Wilson manages to play two characters, both rather villainous.  You just love to hate his characters.  In addition to Elisabeth Shue, they also had to change actors for George McFly, but you'd never know if you didn't watch the credits.  But it's Christopher Lloyd who once again steals every scene he is in as Doc.  That man makes this trilogy.  And watch for an early screen appearance of Elijah Wood during the scenes set in the future.

This movie needed lots of special effects between the actors playing themselves at various ages, playing opposite themselves, plus the flying cars, hover boards, and other fun stuff.  Yes, there are moments when something doesn't work, but they are only on screen for a second or two.  Yeah, the effects are pretty much perfect.

The film is more serious than the first in the series.  There are jokes and laughs, but the story has more at stake for the characters.  Along those lines, there's a pretty big cliffhanger as well, which will make you want to watch Part III right away.  Fortunately, the two movies were filmed back to back so original audiences didn't have to wait very long either.

Back to the Future Part II is one of those rare times when I feel confident saying if you love the original, you'll love the sequel.  It's more fun with characters we already know and love.",1431388800,,3408,4.526229508196721

Put the same drivers on the road in the skies, and the flying cars will be dropping like hail!

They are 8 and 9 years old and had never seen any of the Back To The Futures before. We started with part 2 because the future scenes are just so much fun. It's amazing to see what they thought the future would look like when the made the movie. Hoverboards, sneakers that tie themselves, rehydrating pizzas, and fax machines everywhere! The actors are great, the storyline is fun and creative, and the kids had as much fun as I did watching this. Looking forward to watching the others with them soon.

361325,4,6301666569,"I've  been  a  fan  for  a  long  time  of  this  one.  The  future  is  weird  &  Bizarre.  All  kids  wear  their  pockets  inside  out.
&  of  course  you  got  the  goofy  &  a  very  sensitive  Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd).  Who  does  not  wish  to  at  all  jeopardize  the  future.
Him  &  Marty take  care  of  family  issues  in  the  year  2015.  I  got  to  hand  it  the  producers  &  directors  of  this  one  they  did  a  good  job  finding  an  older  person  who  looks  like  Michael J Fox  while  they  were  there  in  2015.  &  Yes  Marty Junior  who  is  also  played  by Michael J Fox  was  a  complete  wimp!  He  let  the  bullies  Griff  &  his  pals  including  someones  girlfriend  in  the  gang  push  him  around  too  much.  But  it  was  pretty  funny.
I  do  wish  to  comment  a  little  more  on  the  fancy  gadgets  we  saw,  in  Marty  &  Jennifers home  just  after  Marty  gets  fired  by  his  Japaneze  boss,  we  see paper  coming  out  of  some  product, it  reminded  me  of  the  fax machines  we  know. &  an  oven  that  can  cook  a  frozen pizza in  under  5 minutes.  A  house  with  no  doorknobs.  Quite a  weird  future  if  you  ask  me. There's  flying  cars.  &  a  new  freeway  in  the  sky,  &  the  center  you  got  lightposts  that  keep  the  cars  in  one  lane  from  the  cars  coming  in  the  opposite direction.
Marty also buys  an  almanac  which  Old Biff  gets  a  hold  of  &  goes  back  in  time  while  Marty  &  Doc  are  distracted  with  their  business.
Doc  did  get  upset  with  Marty  for  buying  the  sports  Almanac.  What's  wrong  with  placing  a  few  bets  Marty  asks?  Doc  being  his  paranoid  self  puts  it  in  the  trash.  But  unknowingly Biff  was  watching.  So  Doc Brown  invented  a  time  machine,  Soon  because  of  what  Biff  did  Marty  &  Doc  are  taken  by  surprise  when  they  return  to  1985.  Biff  now  owns  a  towering  building  &  is  living  the  highlife.  Marty  must  find  out  a  few  of  Biffs  secrets  in  order  for  him  &  Doc  to  go  back  in  time  to  &  save  the  future.  They  must  steal  the  sports  almanac  from  young  Biff  which  old  Biff  himself  gave  the  book  to  himself.  &  Turned  out  to  be  a  terrible  driver  as  him  &  young  Biff  were  arriving  home.
After  a  few  sneaky  attempts  Marty  finally  gets  the  book  away  from  young  Biff  &  burns  it  in  a  trashcan.
But  hold  everything  folks!  His  friend  the  Doc  is  zapped  when  a  lightening  bolt  hits  the  car  &  takes  him  back  in  time  to  the  old  west.",1423526400,,2613,4.031890660592255

361424,2,6301666569,"If I had a time machine I would go back and ask them to just try harder when they made this film. I saw it when it came out and then, as now, I believe it's the weakest of the series by a long shot. There are so many things wrong and unnecessary, it's hard to know where to begin. But let us remember, the directors never intended to make a sequel. Unlike the first one, money and support were thrown at Zemecki to which he said, 'sure, why not?' And then the recklessness began.

The directors state that they wish Marty's girlfriend weren't in the car at the end of the first in order to leave the sequel plot clear and free. As one may recall, Doc returns to 1985 to fix a problem with Marty's children. OK, here's a thought. Rather than address said problem immediately, why not say, 'Wow, glad we fixed that problem, ey Marty? Now onto the next adventure.' at the beginning of the film? The future for this film could have been wide open, but rather than that we get a pretty contrived problem. Marty Jr. might end up in jail, his sister might end up in jail, etc.

Should we break Doc's mantra of 'don't mess with time! The space-time continuum could unravel!!!!' or use the time machine to help a friend? Seems they'd figure out that they'll always use the machine to help out a friend and the space time continuum will be fine. Seems they'd also figure out that if there's a problem, give yourself more than ten minutes to fix it (i.e. go back a whole month before the event, if you must!!!!).

So they go to the future to help Marty Jr. and, let's be honest, Marty Jr. doesn't really seem worth helping. Spineless, empty-headed, ambitionless- he makes one wonder if Mr. Strickland was right: perhaps the McFly's are slackers, always beyond redemption.

Then we get the hoverboard (cool, though it becomes wayyy overused at this point on in the series) and up crops a SERIOUS problem with parts II and III: originality suffers for a quick in-joke.

'Remember when they used a skateboard? Now they have hoverboards!""

'Remember when Marty gets hit on the head and wakes up by who he thinks is his mom in 1985?'

'Remember when Biff runs into manure?'

Again, and again, and again- same old gags. it's not entirely as bad in part III as here, but here, man, they just phone it in.

And, then we get to future McFly family. They're a disaster. Does Doc mention to Marty how they got that way? Nope. Yes, Marty did save his life by playing with time, yes they played with time to help Marty Jr., but Marty's single incident that made his family live in a dive and lose everything- can't mess with the continuum. Just to show that they can, the directors have M. J. Fox play his future self, future son and... future daughter: completely unnecessary- doesn't move the plot, doesn't tell us much of anything other than how Fox looks weird in drag and the double neck tie will probably never see the light of day.

So then, after all that we have another twist that doesn't help things. Marty suddenly wants to start gambling.

OK, i won't go into the last third of the movie where the directors just give up and show you the highlights of the first movie from a different angle. Let's focus on the gambling.

I have no problem with gambling. i'm not a tee-totaler. Where I have a problem with is how this one event lessens the central character and kind of kills the sequels.

See, the first movie hinges on the idea that Marty is essentially a great guy who just can't get a break. He is the underdog. He doesn't pick fights, he defends himself. He keeps his cool and reacts appropriately to anything. Giving him this gambling issue as well as his 'can't dare be called chicken' makes him somewhat less heroic. He becomes completely flawed. How different is he than the Biff who uses the money to turn Hill Valley into Biff town?

And the other weak point of the movie is the lack of love. The first one had such high stakes: when Marty interferes he not only nearly destroys himself, he also hurts his parents love for one another. He isn't just trying to fix some kooky time problem, he's trying to save love itself. There are big stakes. in the second one, he drops his girlfriend off on a porch in Biff town, of course this is after he drops her off in an alley in the future near some garbage. The Doc assures us she'll be fine. Where's the love?

I think that's where BTTF 3 does a little better: the Doc has a heart. I'd have liked to see more of the Doc defending that than Marty's completely unnecessary moral dilemma (i.e. ""I can't be called a chicken! Or, maybe I can and i'll survive...""), but at least there was some romantic interest in it- something more compelling than whatever was going on in BTTF 2.

On a side note, 1955 Biff is wearing Marty's 1955 outfit from the first movie. Same shirt, same pants, same shoes. Why?

Another side note, in BTTF 3 Marty's great grandmother (1885) looks like 1965/1985 Marty's mom lorraine (since she's played by the same actress). Since his great grandfather (1885) looks like him, why would his great grandmother look like his current mother? Shouldn't she look completely different, or like his father George?",1421884800,5,5170,4.459745762711864

361600,4,6301666569,"The logical sequel to the excellent(5 star) Back to the Future was this installment.  It starred Michael J. Fox again as well as Christopher Lloyd and the other characters from the 1st film.
In this film, we visit the future, where a sports almanac is brought back to the past, allowing someone(we don't like) to amass a fortune from sports betting.  So, this future is a dystopia...a society that basically doesn't work.  The schools have been closed, the school principal spends his time shooing kids away from his yard, and everything is depressed except the casino of the sports-almanac-gambler.  Marty McFly has inadvertently disrupted the time line(again) and has to fix this mess.  Perhaps the mad professor(Christopher Lloyd) can help...or perhaps not.
This film only pales in comparison(to the 1st Back to the Future.)  It's not nearly as much fun, funny, or heartwarming.  It does do its 'duty' as showing a strange future.  That's done so over-the-top that it's worth it just to see if the 'Cubs win the World Series' finally...

361761,3,6301666569,"If you were a fna of the first one, you will ""enjoy"" the sequel, but it has many flaws. For starters, the entire premise is set up on Doc taking Marty to the future to stop his son from getting arrested. Why? Why not just tell Marty? Doc makes this big argument i nthe first about not altering your destiny...yet takes Marty to the future to stop one incident from happening.

How does Doc know Martys son won't screw up again, and again, and again? Meanwhile, future Marty is a loser whose dreams had been shattered, lives in a crappy neighborhood, and as the first movie showed us, your parents failures can result in your childrens negative upbringing. Its like the first movie tells us that Marty and his family would be better off if George had done this or that differently...but then ignores this premise, and instead tries to remedy the actions of Martys teenage son in real time, instead of Doc simply telling Marty ""You get into an accident with a rolls royce and that screws up your whole life and your childrens upbringing.

The other problem with the movie is it feels very redundant. We see Hill Valley in the future, which is, quite frankly, a horror show of cluttered crap and gadgetry. I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old, and sure, I was fascinated with flying cars and hoverboards....but having rewatched it, thank god 2015 don't look like that mess. But the movie doesnt really give us anything new...just a cluttered set of Hill Valley in the ""future"".

Then we see an alternate Hill Valley in 1985, was is a dystopic mess reminiscent of B rate ""urban decay"" films of the 80's. Its also very dark for a back to the future movie, with a tyrannical Biff admitting to murdering George, Martys mom being a drunk abuse victim, and the streets of Hill Valley being over run with roving gangs of machine gunners, like Somalia.

In 2015, Martys neighborhood is a ghetto...in alternate 1985, Hill Valley is a ghetto. Its just depressing. Also, why the hell would a multi-billionaire Biff stay in Hill Valley, in a casino in the middle of a ghetto?

Then, Marty and Doc have to travel back to 1955 to stop future Biff from giving the sports almanac to young Biff, and the rest of the movie is just a repeat of the first, only we are seeing the events take place through alternate angles and perspectives...so yea, its redundant.

This movie suffers from typical hollywood marketing. ""What made the first a success? Idk...lets just sort of repeat it, only through this alternate perspective, and throw in a lot of green screen and cluttered crap.""

That being said, the third back to the future is much more redeeming, and though not a bad movie, Im never too interested in watching it because it lacks what made the first so great. Both the 1950's and 1980's were two decades that ""defined"" the American teenager, or gave the american teenager a voice and identity. This is why the first worked out so well...people from the 1950's having teenaged kids in the 1980's.

The similarities of rock music, cars, rebellion, and normal american teenage problems (high school, girlfriends, bullies) are identical, save for some cultural and etiquette differences. So where does the wild west fit in? So I give BTTF 2 3 stars, because you will get some enjoyment out of it, and the hoverboard scene is pretty much cemented in our pop culture now (""Hoverboards don't work on water!"") But it is a mess.",1417132800,4,3412,4.637417218543046

We had been warned by our daughter that the second and third were not as good as the first in the trilogy but wanted to give it a try anyway.

Part 2 did not get very good reviews, and probably is now even less funny, Since it takes place in 2015 and no one new for sure what 2015 would be like. Needless to say, (and we should all be relieved) that  they missed their mark when predicting what society would be like today.
After missing part 2, I totally missed part 3...until now.
Downloaded the trilogy to watch with my kids...they loved it! Being kids, they found a lot of humor in part 2 being so far off base.
But when filming part 3, they once again had the advantage of knowing what the past looked like, so they could better adapt the plot to make things conceivable, and actually were able to finish it off with some positive philosophy.

There is a lot of seriously bad acting (and not obviously for comedic effect) in this one, but we can't fault them entirely for that I suppose. There's still some great classic moments which I won't spoil in there and there is the introduction of the hoverboard which is awesome.
future Marty's character is kind of contrived, showcasing personality traits that were not apparent in the first (but which resurface in the third). Its always fun to see how a film will treat future tech.

. . .

An unbelievably crass, crude, blunt, clumsy sequel to the original ""Back To The Future,"" which was an '80s classic. This time around, though, the script is forced and clumsy, the time-travel ironies are all on the surface and mostly involve the re-staging of scenes from the first movie, and evoke little of that film's charm.  Most off all, it's just a crude film, full of profanities and adult concepts such as alcoholism and prostitutes, as well as an overabundance of profanities (just about everything besides the ""F word"") that seem pretty inappropriate for the younger audience this film was presumably being marketed towards.

As with other '80s ""kids"" films such as the Spielberg-related ""Goonies,"" director Robert Zemeckis and his collaborators were so into the idea that they could break the confines of kids films the same way that racy content became acceptable in adult films in the '70s. The results don't stand up to the test of time: this movie is inappropriate for smaller kids, and so trashy that the teens and pre-teens it's geared towards will absorb its crudeness, but little else. It's a bad movie with a dumb script and a major case of potty mouth. I'd recommend stopping at the first film, which is a good, lighthearted take on the whole time-paradox thingie. This one blows chunks, though. (Axton)",1385251200,,1353,4.873913043478261

Originally there wasn't supposed to be a sequel, that's why the girlfriend ended up in the car at the end of the first movie, Crispin Glover wanted more money than he deserved. And so he didn't come back, that's why his character is written as being killed in the story. Yes this story is dark,  at the beginning of the movie, Marty and Doc, along with an unconscious Jennifer. Travel to 2013, to save Marty's kids, while in the future. Marty picks up a sports almanac, so he can go back and place bets to make money, Doc catches him, takes the almanac and throws it away. Only Biff from the future, gets it, follows Marty and Doc. And steals the Delorean, takes the almanac to his past self. Now the great thing about this movie, is it is the first sequel to actually go back to events in the first movie and show you scenes just from a different angle. And because Biff went to 1955, and changed the past, it sent Doc and Marty to an alternate 1985. Where Biff is in control of everything, he had George killed married Marty's mother. Marty tries to get the almanac from Biff, but soon realizes that he'll have to back to 1955 and get the almanac there. A lot of twists and turns in this one, and yes the movie has a dark tone it.

I thought there was too much about ""future selves"" meeting ""past selves"" and the supposed impact.  I wasn't too thrilled with the ""to be continued..."" ending.  They did the same thing in the original film, but the story felt complete enough to stand on its own.  Also, there was more swearing (appropriately) than the first movie, which is fine, but just a warning if watching with young kids.

It is somewhat more complicated, read that as confused, measurably less light-hearted and good-natured, but still adequate for family viewing and a soupcon of pleasure. Impossible for me to guess the reactions of those who did not see the first film (as I did before seeing this). Michael Fox does what could be done with a less successful script and, generally, is still a happy choice for the lead. The Mad Professor is still madly played by Christopher Lloyd, doing well what is required which is to give an over-the-top performance. None of the other actors are given a chance to do anything much except serve as second bananas to Fox.
Over-all, mostly a choice for those who enjoyed the first in the series and are willing to tolerate a lesser film for re-acquaintance with the flavor of the series. Fans of Michael Fox will have more reason to watch him when he was still an actor not a writer.

363336,5,6301666569,"Thankfully, Zemeckis and company decided to do a sequel that had a different tone than the first one. Perhaps they realized that improving upon the first one would be impossible. Maybe they thought that doing a note-for-note repeat of the first one would become an exercise in tedium that would ultimately result in nothing more than a heartless money-spinner. Either way, taking things darker makes for a much more satisfying experience than a simple retread.

Zemeckis and company built upon the storyline from BTTF, using a moment of thoughtlessness on Marty's part to get the ball rolling. This results in a situation in which the villain is in charge, thus exposing a seedy side of human behavior that was the complete opposite of the playfulness that characterized BTTF.

There's nothing sunny in this one. For a perfect example, witness the sequence between Marty and Doc Brown that takes place at the cemetary. The cemetary is overgrown and neglected. It's dark and stormy, with trash blowing around in the wind. The scene is barely lit. If there was any doubt at this point, Marty's discovery informs us that it's no longer the 1985 that we knew. It appears that Zemeckis is working hard to drive the point home that the similarities to BTTF end with the major characters. In this go-around, all bets are off, and that's a good thing.

In BTTF, Doc Brown talks about the dangers of time travel, but the consquences of the characters' actions in that one could be considered benign. This one takes Doc's warnings seriously, presenting a worst case scenario that's hellish in comparison.

Zemeckis and company have created a very good sequel that acts on threads introduced in Back to the Future. This installment provides us with the ""continuing"" adventures of Marty McFly, as opposed to the ""repeated"" adventures.",1326844800,,1822,4.963934426229508
363337,4,6301666569,"How the passage of time can change one's perspective.  When BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II made its debut in theaters, I couldn't begin to mask my disappointment.  I found the multi-layered plot of altered realities and constant travel to and fro along a 60-year span annoying.  Having recently viewed this sequel--the second film of the BTTF franchise--I have but one question:

What in the world was I thinking?

This movie is abundantly and extraordinarily and exceedingly clever, as Marty and Doc Brown (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) travel first to 2015 to prevent a potential calamity involving Marty's son, only to rush headlong back to 1985, then 1955, to reverse a dramatic altered reality involving a sports almanac in the hands of one belligerent Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson).  The constant time travel enhances the charm of this film, especially when Marty goes back to 1955 to become a bystander of his own behaviour in the first film.  Not only is he a bystander--he takes additional action that allows himself to complete his task in the original story.  Granted, these additional layers hint at complexity, yet watching both stories unfold simultaneously is grand fun.

The cast works well off one another, with all the major characters save Crispin Glover (George McFly in the original) returning, including Lea Thompson (Lorraine McFly) sporting some eye-opening enhancements in the altered 1985.  No, it's not as good as its predecessor, yet BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II is an entertaining time travel romp.

363338,4,6301666569,"In 1989, Universal Studios, director Robert Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale brought us Back to the Future Part II. This second film has gotten some bad reviews, but it really is an underrated sequel. Marty(Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) travel to the year 2015 to stop Griff Tannen from sending Marty McFly Jr. to jail. While in the future, Marty buys a sports almanac and plans to use it to bet on sporting events in the past. Doc Brown throws the almanac in the trash and Old Biff Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson) fishes it out of the garbage can. Old Biff steals the DeLorean time machine and gives the book to himself in the past. When Marty and Doc Brown return to 1985, Hill Valley, California has been turned into a crime-filled, gritty, polluted dystopia. Biff is filthy rich and married to Marty's mother, Lorraine(Lea Thompson). Marty finds out that George McFly was murdered in 1973! Marty and Doc Brown must travel to the year 1955 and destroy the sports almanac in order to repair the damage to the time line. Claudia Wells played Jennifer Parker in the first film. In the sequels, Jennifer is played by Elisabeth Shue. Crispin Glover didn't want to play George McFly in the sequels. He's filled in with actor Jeffrey Wisemann playing George McFly, still photos of Glover, and stock footage.
 Back to the Future Part II opens with credits playing over stock footage left over from Firefox(1982). Alan Silvestri polished and enhanced some of his music cues from the first Back to the Future. Back to the Future Part II treats us to the sight of Marty using a Hover Board. In 1989, some people thought they were real. We also get to see more of the flying DeLorean. There's sight gags such as Jaws 19 playing in a movie theater and a Max Headroom version of Michael Jackson in the Cafe 80's. Zemeckis pokes fun of himself by putting a Roger Rabbit doll in a window! Zemeckis directed the live action scenes in Who Framed Roger Rabbit(1988). At one point, the scenes in the past were going to take place in 1967. We'd see George McFly and Lorraine as hippies. The producers used 1955 as the past to keep the budget under control. We get to see scenes from the first film at alternate angles. In Back to the Future Part II and III, Marty loses his temper when someone calls him a ""chicken""! This never happened in the first film. Back to the Future Part II is an underrated sequel and Back to the Future Part III completes the story arc.",1320537600,18,2462,4.582766439909297
363339,4,6301666569,"This was actually a really good sequel that followed Part 1 well. Some people were probably upset that they didn't get the original Jen Parker back, but she was such a minor character that they could probably get away with it.

That said, this film takes up just where Part 1 left off, and now Marty must go with Doc Brown to prevent a future disaster with Marty's eventual son. In an interesting ironic moment, Marty calls his son a complete wimp, but we later see that the 47 year old Marty is a wimp in the sense that he can't say no to doing an illegal act which could get him fired.

Moving along, appreicating this film (and part 3 for that matter) relies on us seeing a sudden reversal. In Part 1, Marty worked hard to repair the miserable existence of his parents. AH, BUT NOW, it seems that his parents have gotten their lives on track and that Marty ruined his life by doing something stupid because someone called him 'chicken.' This seemed to become  known as the 'Marty McFly syndrome.' Because of this, he ended up ruining his chance at a career in music, ended up living in a poor area, and in a job he didn't much like, with a possibly abusive supervisor. His son is a mess, and his daughter is uptight. (Sound familiar? Something in Part 1 maybe?)

Speeding along, an ambitious plan to make money backfires, and Marty has jeopardized not only his existence, but that of his parents and even his friend Dr. Brown.  And they have to go back to 1955 yet again to fix the problem.

This creates a really interesting sequence when Dr. Brown and Marty have to avoid coming into contact with their 'already been there counterparts.'

They of course accomplish there plans, but we have yet another problem as Doc is struck by lightning and zapped into the past, and  Marty must seek help from the Dr. Brown of 1955. Sometimes cliffhanger endings can work well in comedy. Onto Part 3!",1318464000,,1892,4.463768115942029

363410,3,6301666569,"When it debuted in the winter of 1989, this sequel's wide-eyed portrait of the future was so ambitious and dramatic that it was tough to look beneath the surface. Today, a mere four years removed from the distant year 2015 depicted on the screen, those predictions seem more like a creative writing essay from the science fiction magazines of the 1950s. They remain endearing and entertaining, but in a different way - the jokes still work, but the more serious elements either don't play or, worse, come off as pure camp. And, with the shiny veneer of that potential future relegated to nothing more than a running series of sight gags, the holes and flaws of the plot itself find themselves stripped bare. It came as something of a shock to me, given my fond memory, but this really is not a good film. What screen time the cast doesn't spend breathlessly explaining the plot (which is, perhaps, fifty percent of the film) is devoted to revisiting several of the best scenes from the first movie, rather than creating fond memories of their own. It's an overly elaborate story, unashamedly building to the simultaneously-filmed follow-up, that has neither the steady pace nor the genuine charm of the original. Plot holes the size of a steam engine are the least of its concerns, given that the first film managed to be such a success in spite of similar problems.",1310342400,2,1366,4.743697478991597

Then his friend ""Doc"" Brown comes back and tells him that there is a problem with his son in the future and Marty and Jennifer go into Doc's DeLoren and go ahead in time to 2015. Marty's son Marty Jr gets arrested thanks to Biff's grandson Griff-and Marty must change things to make sure that that does not happen.

Marty is able to make sure his future son does not get arrested, but soon things do not turn out well. Marty sees a book that list the sports stats from 1950 to 2000-he buys it with the intention of making money when he gets back to 1985. Unfortunitly an older Biff gets his hands on it, steals the DeLoren and gives it to his younger self without Marty or Doc knowing.

When Marty and Doc get back to 1985 things are not the same as they were when they left. There is crime all over Hill Valley and Griff is very wealthy, married to Marty's mom and his dad is dead.

Doc and Marty realize that Biff got a hold of the sports book and they go back to 1955 to make sure the alternet version of 1985 does not happen.

363415,4,6301666569,"Back to the Future Part II is a good movie, and a good time travel story, yet it is my least favorite of the three Back to the Future movies. I think that is because the of dark, depressing landscape that the ""present day"" time period holds for Marty and Doc. The end of Back to the Future promises a trip to the future to see Marty's kids, and this movie follows through on that promise, although not in exactly the way you would think giving the ending conversation of the first movie. However, that escapade does set up important elements of the story for both this movie and the next. Parts II and III were shot and edited at the same time, and then released only a few months apart.

Marty returns to the present to find that a moment of greed he had in the future results in a major change in the course of time. The rest of the movie is spent in the future and in 1955 to correct the events that caused the change. You get another slant on the dance in 1955 as Marty experiences it from a second viewpoint. The movie has twists and turns that you won't expect, and is a lot of fun to watch. Highly recommended, but only in its proper order between Parts I and III. Otherwise it won't make a lot of sense to you.",1284681600,,1218,4.139240506329114

363417,4,6301666569,"When I heard there was a sequel to Back to the Future I thought; don't tell me, the first one was a giant success and this one's going to be a giant failure, right? Well I was 100% wrong, this sequel is actually very good and it's so consistant to the first movie which is great. The plot picks up right after the first movie with a now flying delorian transporting Doc and Marty to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty's son from going to jail. After that, Marty buys a sports almanac that tells the outcomes of every sporting event from 1950-2000. Then when Doc and Marty go back to 1985, Hill Valley has been turned into Hell Valley with Biff as a ruler and the clock tower is now a casino hotel owned by Biff. At first Marty has no idea how this happened but then he learns that an old Biff from 2015 stole the almanac and the delorian, went back to 1955, gave it to his younger self and that's how Biff got rich. Now Marty and Doc go back to 1955 to get the alamanac back from Biff and if your confused, so am I and that's why it's so great. The characters are still great: Marty is still the heroic role model and Doc is still the funny doctor. Then only characters who seems to change is Biff; in the first movie he's just a bully, but here he's more cruel and evil which makes him more of an antagonist. Now let me talk about the music, this is something I never got around to with the first movie, the music by Alan Silversti is so amazing, it sets the epicness for the movies.

363491,5,6301666569,"The day after Marty gets back from 1955, Doc leaves in the time machine to go the future to the year 2015, only to return seconds later (though much more time has passed for Doc). Something terrible happens in the future to Marty's son. Thankfully Marty and his son are the spitting image of each other so Doc has come up with a plan to have Marty take the place of his son for a few minutes to make a correct decision to prevent the bad incident from happening. But while they are in the future, the Biff we know from 1955 and 1985 overhears Marty and Doc talking about their time machine. So Biff decides to change his crappy life by stealing the time machine and going back to 1955 with a sports almanac with all the winners of every sport up to the year 2000. So when Marty and Doc make it back to 1985, it's a very different 1985 than the one that they left. After figuring out what happened, they must once again go back to 1955 to prevent the almanac from being used by Biff so they can save the future that they know. Whew.

I'm a huge fan of the second movie of the trilogy. It used to be my favorite of the trilogy. Probably because of the flying cars and the hover board. Also the more in depth time traveling was definitely nice to have, even though you had to suspend a little bit of belief of how time travel works. Because honestly if Biff goes back in time and changes time, then time should've altered while Marty and Doc were in 2015. To me, the 2015 scenes were cool, but the movie becomes a lot better when they go back to 1955 again. It was a lot of fun to see Marty watching himself do the things he was doing in the first movie. Like when you see him low crawling under a window of the car that part 1 Marty is sitting in with his teenage version of his mother from 1955. Also it was funny to see Fox play multiple characters in this movie such as his son, his older self and even his daughter from 2015. Also it was amusing to see the 2015 Biff ragging on his former 1955 self for being dumb and sounding like an idiot. And also seeing the son of Biff, Griff, was a trip too. Because he's basically the same type of bully his father was in 1955, but more juiced up because of robotic implants. It was even nice to see Zemeckis do an homage to part 1 by having almost the same skateboard scene from part 1 in this movie also, but a more futuristic version of it.

Though it used to be my favorite of the trilogy, I'm starting to lean more to part 1 being my favorite, but part 2 is definitely a close second. Once again, this movie is a classic also and I highly recommend it if you loved part 1.

P.S. - From the first time I saw this move to right now as I type this... I want a friggin hover board!",1241395200,3,2724,4.068901303538175
363492,5,6301666569,"what i really like about this film isn't the future-which illustrated somewhat depressing and too artificial and even the characters look unreal or too much made-up. its the fact that this film explain the first film and doc mention in this film that the date 5th november 1955 is a special CORE DATE in the time phase and in all the trilogy. a date in which doc fell and got his head beaten by the sink and then he saw the vision and idea of time traveling,a date in which marty's parents meet and fall in love(which we learn in the first film),a date in which a lightening strike the clock tower and shuting it down and then in this way the marty from first film goes back to the future,and a date that from unknown reason the old beef choose to come back and give the almanac to his young self.from the day after this date,the 3rd movie begin and in this movie we learn more about this core date 5th november and see another angle of this day that we couldn't see in the first film,angle of the other marty that comes again to this date and see the marty from the first movie. this is the amazing part of this film esepecially when the marty from the future has to do his mision-getting the almanac from bif-without disturbing the marty from the first movie making his parents fall in love.
like this fictional core date i think everyone has a core date in their lives when so many important events happen,events that start alot of eras in the future and affect strongly on our lives.

the second interesting thing is the ""TIME PARADOX"",which is a philosophy of its own,that mentioned in the film.this paradox described by doc as something that destroy the time continum and the universe,but when u try to think what happens if the 2 martys meet and the circumstances its a complex theory of its own-beyond the films. i tried to think what happen if the martys meet and realized that if they meet and the marty from the future alter the actions of the marty from first film,he won't get back to the future(probabely by missing the lightning that strike the clock,and the marty from future won't get to the future and won't return to the past and so on....the whole film destroyed(or universe as doc mentioned)! thinking about all this circumstances is more complex then physics and other sciences,if time travel was a reality there would be a new science that deal with this.",1237593600,2,2378,4.50462962962963
363493,3,6301666569,"First off, let me say I don't hate this film, but compared to the ""Original"" & Part ""III"", this one fails, not because its bad, but because you really have to suspend belief big time here, like most SCI-FI fans I have always liked anything that deals with time travel, so many ideas to play with, but in reality time travel would be quite dangerous, & this film makes that clear in more ways than one, but is poorly executed & here's why....

For starters this one picks up where Part ""I"" left off with Doc carrying Marty & Jennifer into the future to 2015 to save their future son from being involved in a robbery that will get him life in prison, this would of course be inpulsive to stop this, but from a realistic standpoint Marty & Jennifer's removal from 1985 would have altered the future of 2015 where they would not exist because of their removal.

Secondly, let's ignore that logic for a moment, Marty buying a sports almanac in 2015 would be inpulsive for anyone, I mean hey, why not place bets in the past, right, well old Biff does this very thing by stealing the almanac & the DeLorean & goes back to 1955 & gives the almanac to his younger self thus changing everything from that point foward, when he returns to 2015, he is dying, again, his actions would have altered Doc & Marty's Twin Pine mall meeting in the first film thus altering Marty's trip to 1955 & their trip to the future in 2015.

Now, let's ignore that logic for a moment, the hellish 1985 is done quite well & Marty & Doc's culture shock is fun, but it should have been done differently, with Doc returning from 2015 with the almanac & the 1985 Biff going back to 1955 with the almanac, & Marty & Doc chasing him back before he could give it to himself, this would have been more plausible, again, I don't hate this one, but when dealing time-travel, you have to at least make it believeable, a pre-destination paradox is really the only way to do anything dealing with time-travel, ""Star Trek"" always did this quite well, as does the ""Terminator"" films where Arnold & Reese's trip to the past actually set up their futures, & ""Star Trek"" was always careful about this, as was the first & third ""Back to the Future"" films where nothing is really altered seriously as in the case of the first ""Back to the Future"" where Marty interupts his parents meeting but does manage to get them together.

Another flaw in Part ""II"" is the future scenes, like ""TimeCop"" they got it wrong, which in essence sort of kills the magic a bit, unlike ""Star Trek"" or the ""Alien"" films where the future is set hundreds of years ahead, predicting the near future is always never accurate, Kurt Russell's ""Escape From New York"" suffers from this as well as Kubrick's ""2001"" as does one of SCI-FI's best ""Blade Runner"" if your going to do the future, at least do it in a time where we are all gone.

I hate to nitpick, but no matter how enjoyable & fun ""Back to the Future II"" is, I feel they should have left the future alone, aside from this, this one is enjoyable, but Part ""I"" & ""III"" are more believeable.",1235260800,4,3068,4.3848857644991215

""Yeah!""

""That event doesn't happen until tonight. So you must be careful no to run into your otherself.""

- Doc Brown, of 1985, gives Marty McFly a severe headache in the ways of physical time travel in ""Back To The Future Part II""

The time travel adventures (or is it screw ups) of Marty McFly continue in Robert Zemeckis' ""Back To The Future Part II"".

Picking up seconds after the original ""Back To The Future"", Doc Brown, Marty, with Marty's girlfriend Jennifer, head to the year 2015 to save his future kids from life in prison.

After Marty gets everything straightened out with his kids (and having a run in with an elderly Biff Tannen), he gets a good look at Hill Valley of the future (complete with flying cars, hoverboards, & ""Jaws 19"") & also gets a dangerous idea.

After visiting an antique store Marty picks up an old sports almanac that lists all the major sporting events & each championship victory of that year in each sport, up to the year 2010. If Marty takes the book back to 1985, he can easily become an overnight billionaire! Of course Doc Brown puts an immediate stop to this explaining to Marty that his idea would change the course of history with almost disasterous consequences. Doc Brown junks the almanac, but not before a sly, elderly Biff Tannen figures out whats going on with the two time travelers & picks up the book.

With the future set, Marty & Doc head back to 1985, but, upon arrival they both find out that something is way out of whack. Marty's neighborhood looks like a ghetto and not ""The Lyon Estate's"" homestead that he's accustomed to. Doc Brown's lab is completely vandalized, Hill Valley High is a burning monument & worst of all Biff Tannen rules all of Hill Valley, turning the clocktower into a big hotel & casino named, what else, ""Biff's"".

Upon further investigation, Doc Brown finds out that the elder Tannen of 2015 had somehow stolen the DeLorean, going back thru time & given the sports almanac too a younger version of himself. Marty's original idea comes into play, as the younger Biff places bets on every major sporting event with a snowball's chance in hell of losing. He becomes a billionaire overnight & sets into motion a big dose of anti-time. This anti-time kills off the 1985 that Marty & Doc live in & replaces it with the nightmare version of 1985, in where Marty's father is mysteriously murdered, his mother gets re-married to Biff & Doc Brown gets committed to the nuthouse!

""Its like we're living in Hell or something.""

""No, it's Hill Valley alright. But, I can't imagine Hell being much worse!""

The boys figure out where &, more importantly, when Biff dropped off the almanac & as luck would have it, it happens to be on the sameday & date that Marty originally goes back to the future - Saturday, November 5, 1955.

Its the dawning hours of November 5, 1955 (""Whoa, its like I was just here, yesterday."" ""You were here, Marty! You were.""). Doc & Marty have to get back the almanac in order to return the space-time continium back to its original order. Its easier said then done.

Doc tells Marty that: first, he has to find Biff and follow him. Let old Biff give young Biff the sports book. Once old Biff leaves get the book back from the younger Biff. Destroy the book.

Second & more importantly, there are now two Marty's here, & they can not under any circumstances run into there otherselves. If this happens this could lead to a paradox that could unravel what takes place in the original ""Future"" & Marty could end up killing himself.

Its a literal race against time as Marty tries to restore the time-stream, so he and Doc can go back, once again, to the future.

""I know you sent me back to the future, but, now I'm back- I'm back from the future.""

""Back To The Future Part II"" is one of those films that you really have to pay attention to in order to get the overall understanding of it. This turned a lot of casual moviegoers off, saying it wasn't the easygoing film that the original was, and it isn't. Its more sci-fi than comedy and thats pretty much why ""BTTF PartII"" doesn't have the spirit of the original ""BTTF"". That doesn't make it a bad film, though (I would take this trilogy over the ""Matrix"" trilogy anyday).

Originally, ""Back To The Future Part II"" was supposed to be one big film in where Marty, Doc, & Jennifer head to the future & through some unusual circumstances wind up in the old west.

With the budget numbers being so huge, director Zemeckis approached ""Universal"" saying that he could make two films, back-to-back, if he could get the green light for the proposed budget. ""Universal"" gave the thumbs up and ""Back To The Future Part's II & III"" were headed into production.

For ""BTTF Part II"" a new type of special effect was introduced. The effect had to do with using the same actor portraying two different characters interacting with each other in the same shot. During the older days of T.V. & movies, when this happened the actors would stand on each side of the screen with a huge space between them, in order not to interact with each other and kill the illusion, as well as, the shot. With this new effect for ""Future II"" the same actor could carry on a casual conversation with each other while sitting next to each other at the dinner table. A perfect scene of this effect in action is the McFly dinner scene in 2015. Two actors are in this shot, but one of them, Michael J Fox, plays three different people (Marty, Marty Jr., & Marlene, Marty's daughter)all sitting at the dinner table, interacting with each other.

Before the film's November 22, 1989 theatrical release, the original ""Back To The Future"" was broadcast on NBC with a special look at ""II"" hosted by Leslie Neilsen. During the special the hoverboard was unveiled for the first time, with Robert Zemeckis saying that the hoverboards were an actual working toy, but, due to Federal Regulations the toy was not put on the market due to safety issues. After the broadcast both NBC Studios & Universal were beseiged with calls on how & where to get the hoverboards. To this day, some people believe they might still be real.

""Back To The Future Part II"" is a decent follow up to a classic original and is worth watching, no matter what time it is.",1122595200,,6442,4.520206362854686

Of course, the first one will always have the magic of presenting us with this incredible storyline, but the action and craziness of the second one is really cool and takes the cake.

1. All the time traveling. 1985 to 2015 to 1985 to 1955 to 1885...it's great!

2. The fact that at one point in 1955, there were three DeLorians there at the same time (the original Marty trip, Old Biffs trip from 2015, and the fix-it trip with Doc and Marty).

3. Seeing Marty watch himself play at the school dance.

4. The 2015 billboard that ""Miami"" won the World Series. Well ""Florida"" won in 2003, so that wasn't a bad guess.

5. The Cafe 80s.

6. Marty's meeting with the Western Union delivery man. Way too cool.

363582,5,6301666569,"A film by Robert Zemeckis
The story of Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) continues in this sequel to 1985's ""Back to the Future"".  The movie picks up right where the first film left off where Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) returns in the DeLorean and tells Marty and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue, replacing Claudia Wells) that they have to come back with Doc to the future to help their future children.  This scene was re-shot for this movie because of Elisabeth Shue taking over the role of Jennifer from Claudia Wells, but it is otherwise the exact same scene that we saw in the ending of ""Back to the Future.""
They are off to 2015 so that Marty can prevent his son, Marty Jr (also Michael J Fox) from getting into some trouble with Griff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson), the grandson of Biff Tannen (also Thomas F. Wilson).  While they are in the future, there is a little problem. Marty stops Marty Jr from getting into trouble, but Jennifer is picked up by the police (Doc gave her something so she can just sleep and not get into any trouble) and returned to her future self's home.  While Marty and Doc go to get her before she is seen by her family, the old Biff Tannen overhears them talking about time travel and grabs ""Gray's Sports Almanac"" and goes back to 1955 and gives the almanac to his younger self.  Now the  young Biff is free to gamble on sporting events knowing the outcome.  When Marty and Doc return to 1985, it is an alternate 1985 because the town was changed when Biff won millions gambling.  It changed everything in Hill Valley.  The rest of the movie is Marty and Doc trying to find out what happened and fixing things back in 1955 (where a different Marty is already there doing what he did in the first ""Back to the Future"" movie"").
This has always been my favorite of the Back to the Future movies.  I like how it shows even more how seemingly small events can change what happens in the future.  I like watching Marty see himself helping his parents in 1985 (more scenes that had to be re-filmed to get Marty in two places at once).  I also appreciate how much attention to detail there was in relation to the first movie as well as what would foreshadow the third movie.

363586,4,6301666569,"When I was a kid, I saw this movie before I saw the first one.  I liked this movie a lot anyway, and I finally saw the first one and it all made sense.  The first movie is truely a classic.  This one, however, misses the believability that made the first one great.  The first movie had one conflict that was made known early in the movie, and the rest of the movie builds to the resolution of that conflict.  This movie has about three or four conflicts.  But it's still fun.
Actually, this movie is what most people remember about the BttF series.  The flying Delorean, the hover board, the almanac, etc.  Don't follow my lead: see the first movie before this one (obviously).  And don't expect this movie to be very scientific or believable; just expect it to be a fun movie.
On a final note (skip this all if you just want a movie review), to the guy who wrote the review with the ""paradox"" in it: you're misinformed, bud.  Marty wouldn't disappear, because he made the past the same as it was before he changed it.  The only difference was his mom didn't wind up liking his dad because he was an idiot; she liked him because he was brave and stood up for her.  If there's any paradox, it's that his parents never stopped to say, ""Gee, our son looks a lot like good old Calvin from high school.""  Surely they remember the guy who brought them together.  And as far as Marty and Jennifer not needing to travel to the future goes, you make no sense.  They traveled into the future to create the time loop necessary to prevent their son from going to jail.  Since Marty and Jennifer both eventually returned to the present (1985), they will still be married and have kids.  And their son will still get into trouble with Biff's grandson, and then young Marty will show up in the time loop to prevent him from going to jail again.  There's no paradox there.

363587,4,6301666569,"This film was great. In fact, it inspired my love of all things futuristic.
The thing about the film though was that it was only made to satisfy the audience's thirst for comedic time-travel. The whole paradox starts in BttF Part 1, when Marty practically changes his parents from dooshbags to wowzers. Marty STILL should have disappeared, despite getting his parents back together. Remember Old Biff in the deleted scene? Biff disappears because he changed his past to become rich. Marty, then, should have disappeared cause he made his parents popular and confident.
Again, the paradox in BttF Part II is that Marty doesn't need to go to the future to rescue his kid, cause once he and Jeniffer leave with Doc, they technically won't be there in 2015. Biff won't get the almanac, and there wouldn't be an 'alternate' 1985.
There are loads more paradoxs to add to that, but too many to add here. I'll let you guys figure that out when you watch it.
Other than that, it was a great movie, with a great cliffhanger, and it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.",1055030400,,1078,4.619791666666667

363648,5,6301666569,"Back to the Future Part II, staring Micheal J Fox (Marty McFly)  and Christopher Lloyd (Dr. Emmett L. Brown) is a fun and very enjoyable sequal to the box off smash hit of 1985, and will be a movie that fans of all ages will truly enjoy.
After the great time altering adventure from the first movie, it was hard to truly match the magic and enjoyment that the first movie gave us. But they pull if off quite well and the movie is a fun, if not better at points, movie then the first was.  The movie starts us right where the first left us, almost literaly. With the souped up DeLorean, taking off like an aircraft zooming up into the skies with our two heroes and Marty's girlfriend about to embark on a journy to the future.
The story this time around is that after coming back from the future Dr. Brown warns Marty of problems with his future kids and they quickly have to head there to fix the problems.  After arriving in the year 2015, Marty quickly gets into action impersonating his son and stopping a bully by the name of Griff from ruining his son's life. Marty though after worrying that his future may not turn out as well as he hopes , buys a sports almanac at the town book store to take back to 1985 with him. When Doc finds out he makes Marty lose the book only for the book to wind up in the future version of Biff Tannen's hands. Biff steals the time machine, goes back in time and delivers the book to himself in 1955 altering the present and everything after. It's now up to Marty and the Doc to go back to 1955 and prevent young Biff from getting the book and altering the present and future forever.
The wonderful thing about this movie is that it captures the magic of the first, as well as adding some new elements and being a non-stop action paced romp from time period to time period. Having traveled from 1985-2015-1985-1955 and make it all work was no easy task but they pulled it off beautifuly.
A lot of great special effects and ideas were used in this film. Most noticably was a toy called the ""hoverboard"" which is a futuristic skateboard that hovered over the air floating gently. The way they pull off the scenes using this device were pretty impressive to say the least. Also a lot of the interaction between characters playing more then one character at a time was pretty cool to see. There is a scene where Michael J. Fox is playing 3 characters on the screen at once in the future. Lastly seeing the DeLorean fly and taking the whole Back to the Future franchise an extra step is a thrill a moment. This movie is action packed and fun and well written with the same Back to the Future familiarity we all loved, (inclucing a wonderful musical score by Alan Silvastri and the same running gags from the first)you definitely won't be disapointed with this movie.
A few complaints I would have of this movie was the absense of the George McFly character due to the actor from the first movie not doing the part again he had a minor part if any. Also the movie can be very confusing when watching it the first or so time, this is truly a movie to watch more then once so you can understand everything. Also getting the DVD version so you can see scenes cut out will help to also tie things together better that may have you still scrating your head. Lastly would be that this is really just a cliffhanger (and what some called a cheap Advertisement)for the less appealing and slower Back to the Future part III, which like this part would continue right where the second part leaves us. While it is a bit of a disapointment it is one of the first movies to do this type of method for trilogies takign it from the exact moment it leaves us (Lord of the Rings and Matrix being the more recent examples)
Overall if you are looking for a fun sequal and a movie that all ages will truly love for either effects, humor or nostalgia. This is the one for you. The actors play their parts as if it were second nature and the movie doesn't dispoint in the same way the first didn't.",1045180800,3,4005,4.316069057104913

I like the way Robert Zemeckis works his magic and transcends his talents. The way he used both time settings from part one and then added the very intrigueing setting of the future just blows my mind. It gives me alot of inspiration to see a film with such creativity. I seem to catch myself watching one of the three films at least once a week. I would like very much to own the trilogy if one was to be released. So for all you fans out there lets get our votes in and get that trilogy out. The sooner it comes out the sooner we can sit back and enjoy.,1020124800,2,678,3.9926470588235294
363652,4,6301666569,"This is the zaniest of the Back to The Future series.  It has a quite inticrate web of alternate time lines.  It doesn't get this way until later in the movie.  This second movie picks up right after the first one left off.  Doc Brown takes Marty thirty years into the future.  In the year 2015 they correct an incident that leads to a bad life for Marty's future family.  Then they go back to 1985 (the contemporary year of this movie series). This seems simple enough.  But Marty notices many things that are different about his neighborhood.  There are dog packs running loose, bars on his house windows, chalk outlines of murder victims, a burned down school, and drive-by shootings.  When he gets to the middle of his town he sees a huge casino owned by Biff. It soon becomes clear what has happened.  The 2015 Biff used the time machine to give the younger version of himself a sports almanac with all the answers to horse race results.  The younger Biff won zillions of dollars at the horse track and used that money to corrupt the state legislature into legalizing casino gambling.  The signs of deterioration he noticed in Hill Valley were because of the impact that the casino had on the community.
This is the single most charming part of this movie.  It reminds me of a dog racing magnate in my own state.  It is not as powerful as the premise of the first movie, which is a teenager seeing what his parents were like when they were his age.  But this casino scenario as well as the quirkiness of the time travel overlaps make this movie quite entertaining.
One final note.  Although this movie was not intended to be prophecy but rather a funny entertaining story, some of the predictions have come true.  Miami now has a baseball team, and there are already places devoted to 1980's nostalgia.  But I'm still waiting on them to invent that hydrator.",1019260800,2,1863,4.543543543543543

While in the future, an older version of Biff Tanen steals the time machine and goes to 1955 to help his young self get rich and famous.  Now Doc and Marty must go back and stop that.
This was another great movie, and the jokes are still fresh and funny.  This movie is a little darker than the other two, and there is a big climax towards the end.

With some added in-jokes and weird humour, BTTF part 2 is an exercise in vivid storytelling and great laughs. And with an ending that screams, ""come back in 6 months"", the second part to one of the greatest trilogies of all time has the audience in reassurance that they're in for a treat.",1018051200,,597,4.862745098039215
363655,4,6301666569,"I am an enormous fan of satire, when it's done right. Examples: Pretty much everything from George Romero (The Living Dead trilogy, ""Bruiser""), ""American Beauty,"" and books by Kurt Vonnegut. The strongest plot thread of ""Back to the Future Part II"", ultimately the lesser of the trilogy, is the element of satire, which brings out a huge string of laughs as we are catapulted from one decade/century to the next. 1985 to 2015, 2015 back to an alternate 1985, then back to 1955, where we were in the first film. We see this in the form of greed, which is symbolized in a sports almanac that tells all the results of major sporting events for the last half of the 20th century, and in the form of the dependence we can have on technology. In essence, when can we go too far with our own ""technological brilliance""? Time travel, as we have been repeatedly warned by many films, can be extraordinarily dangerous. ""The consequences could be disasterous.""
This is the element that makes ""Back to the Future Part II"" a great science fiction entertainment while still coming short of the masterpiece status that was achieved by the original and the final entry. Why? Mostly because it this is the second act in a trilogy. The second act is always much darker, as is true with ""Empire Strikes Back"" and others, but when you're talking about a cuckoo comedy series, darkness can put a damper on some of a film's tone. Zemeckis and his co-writer Bob Gale did their best to overcome this inevitable trap in every scene, and for the most part, they've succeeded, but not entirely. Some of this film, while it waves the flag of satire around, goes from wacky fun to downright depressing at times. But as a whole, that is totally okay, because when the film is over, we are left with the satire, and some amazing visual effects. You can tell that Bob Zemeckis was really coming into his own as a visual stylist with this film. The cast, mostly recruited from the original feature, minus the really hot original Jennifer (replaced by the highly recognizable Elizabeth Shue), settle right back into their roles nicely, taking their characters to the next level, as they should in a sequel. What went wrong with the later ""Rocky"" sequels goes right here: The characters continue to evolve and learn new things. Stallone put his fighting hero into a rut after a while, and produced an incredibly terrible dud known as ""Rocky V"", one of the worst movies ever made. Doc and Marty, on the other hand, are always adapting. Marty, mostly just a scared but witty kid in the original film, is slowly learning that he has to become a man of action in order to make things happen. Doc's emotions become much clearer as they should, after knowing Marty for 30 years as opposed to just a few. Their connection in this film, as they hop from one adventure to the next, isn't just a straight man-funny kid kind of thing: It's a real, interesting friendship, like Daniel-san and Mr. Miyagi in ""The Karate Kid"". And it is because of this that we truly do root for them as they try to stop Young Biff from enjoying his time with the priceless sports almanac too much, steal it back and reset the balance of good and evil in the space-time continuum.
I love all of these movies, and just because I'd rather watch the first and last doesn't make this one any less necessary. It's terrific, wacky fun; I enjoy it, and every satirical bone in it's entertaining body.",1017964800,,3427,4.601307189542483

363740,4,6301666569,"Not a classic in the sense that Gone With The Wind or The Wizard of Oz are classic movies, but a classic in its own right.  That is how I would describe Back To The Future, Part ll.
Like most of us I viewed Part 1, Part ll, and Part lll, each several months apart.  Each movie was good in its own right.  It wasn't until I sat down with all three films and watched them together, in order, that the true genius of the writing presented itself with about twenty five million jigawatts of fun and excitement.
Of all three installments, Part ll is the most entertaining and spellbinding.  For a fantasy this is about the best I've seen since the creation of Superman.
It is not one single element of the film or the trilogy that make Back To The Future, a new twist on H.G. Wells The Time Machine.  The surround sound is certainly out of this world.  The special effects are second to none.  Some may think this is a science fiction movie, and it is, but more then science fiction, Back To The Future is a love story about Marty McFly and his girlfriend, Jennifer, make no mistake about it.  When you add the element of love to the comedic mix, special effects, and wonderful video production techniques, you have a spellbinding combination.  The technique of going thirty years into the past and thirty years into the future allows the writer to capture sixty years of events in a format where the viewer is forced to examine how events in 1955 shape and change events in 1985 as well as 2015.
In 1985 it was the Lybian terrorists, in 2001 it is Osama bin Laben and the Al-Queda terrorists.  Sixteen years in the future and audiances can easily relate to the storyline.
I urge those with a flair and yearning for a romantic comedy which is never going to be dated, to buy their own copy of Back To The Future, Part ll, as well as the two other movies in the trilogy.  View them in order and you too will be saying, ""Doc, we don't have enough road to get up to 88!""  To which Doc Brown replies, ""Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads.""  Music up as the DeLorean zooms accross the screen in route, Back To The Future.  See you in the future, I mean, the past, I mean, I concure with the words of Doc Brown, ""The future is not yet written, so make it a good one!""  But that line is from Part lll.

The story takes place immediately after the first, as in most Rob Zemckis sequels.  Marty McFly Just got back from the 50's from saving his parent's fate and his in the time traveling DeLorean that Doc Brown created.  But before Marty and Girlfriend Jennifer can relax, Doc shows up saying that Marty's kids are in deep trouble.  They travel again to 2015 (which, although seems a bit ""80's-ish"",it still is very well done, with flying cars and all.) to fix the mistakes.  After meeting an older Biff, the nemesis from the first film, Marty Purchases a Sports Aliminac, in a very clever scheme in winning money, but Doc throws in away,in order to save existance.  But when the the team gets back from 2015 to 1985, the 1985 Hill Valley that we know and love is a pit hole of filth, money, gangs and greed. It turns out that older Biff got his hands on the Alminac that Marty Puchased, took the DeLorean and went back in time to the younger Biff we knew and gave it to him to buy.  He became so rich and greedy from the money, that he turned 1985 upside down.  Now, Marty, Doc and Enstein (Doc's Dog) must go back to 1955 to take back the Alminac before the future is destroyed!
BTTF2 is very well done for a sequel, espacilly the finale in which the gang goes back to 1955, in which most of the orginal scenes were re-shot to make a different angle for the film, since Marty sees himself many times in action getting his parents back (the object of the first film).  Many of the original cast returned, including Micheal J. Fox, Lea Tompson, Crispin Glover and Christopher Lloyd.  Not many people know that the girl who played Jennifer, Elizibeth Shue, wasn't the original girl from the first film, but make-up can fool many people.

363792,4,6301666569,"There must be some unwritten Hollywood law that requires the middle film of an epic sci-fi cinema trilogy to leave you hanging at the end. Han's still in need of rescuing & Luke's in need of therapy at the end of ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The son of Sarek was reborn, rescued and revived at the end of ""The Search For Spock"", the middle chapter of Star Trek's ""Death and Rebirth of Spock"" trifecta. But he's not quite the half-Vulcan he once was, and his shipmates still await their fates for breaking several laws in the rescue of their comrade. And Marty's stuck in 1955 again at the end of ""Back To The Future II"". I'm tellin' ya, it's a ploy, man!
But all conspiracy theories aside, at least BTTF-2's not nearly as dark and gritty as those other two cliffhangers of note. There's no hand amputations followed by revelations of... um... family ties (sorry, couldn't resist). And nobody's forced to hear his estranged son being executed by the underlings of a warmongering extraterrestrial who has an uncanny likeness to 'Doc' Brown (sorry, couldn't resist this one either). Of course, considering the fact that the BTTF trilogy is comedy, it's expected to be more upbeat.
However, also unlike ""...Empire"" & ""...Spock"", which stand up fairly well on their own without the viewer really needing to see their predecessors to get the gist, BTTF2 isn't so fortunate. There's so many links to the previous film, as well as a few hints to what'll be seen in the next outing, that it's not very good as a stand-alone sequel. It's just the middle part that's deeply interlaced into the whole. You've really gotta check out BTTF-1 before taking a crack at round 2. It'll help clear things up immensely.
Now it's time for me to let you in on one of the film's NOT-so-special effects. If you look really carefully during the 2015 hoverboard chase scene, there's a few very brief moments where you can just make out the support wires that help ""suspend"" the boarders off the ground.  I bet you're wondering why I've let you in on something that would ruin the movie's magic. The reason: I'm an insensitive lout who finds boundless joy in revealing a movie's optical shortcomings for the express purpose of making my fellow videophiles suffer. I find it to be very therapeutic: it increases my self-esteem and makes me feel better about myself, so there! But look on the bright side- maybe they'll correct this little glitch and release it as a Special Edition DVD. If they can do it for the Star Wars trilogy, ""The Abyss"", and the upcoming DVD release of ""Star Trek The Motion Picture"", why NOT the BTTF trilogy?

363793,4,6301666569,"Unlike so many sequels intended for family movies, this vehicle never talks down to the audience or has a too thin plot--if anything it is too thick.
Fox not only must go forward in time to save his kids from a gang arrest, but must go back into 1955 to regain a book that had been lifted from him by long time nemisis Biff. If he does not retrive the Sports Almanac from Biff, his 1985 presence will also be threatened by Biff's ""good fortune"".
In an industry that has currently interpreted comedy as licence to make as many gross jokes as often as possible, the reunion of Fox and Lloyd reminds us that it is possible for people to be funny without resorting to crude humor.
Fox is the usually likeable boy---and girl next door(he plays his daughter Marlene in the future segment)and even when his character does something really dumb or snaps at another character, the audience members cannot help but place themselves in his shoes.",994550400,2,935,4.571428571428571

SO DON'T DELAY BUY IT TODAY AND IT TOO WILL BE YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE.  don't let biff get ya.,985564800,,266,3.8703703703703702
363795,4,6301666569,"After seeing the first BTTF movie, I had to see the next one.  So I hopped on down to my local Blockbuser and picked up a copy.  The only thing I knew about the movie was that they go to the Future.
So I go hope and start whatching it.  Part 2 opens with Part one's ending - re-acted out.  The first thing I noticed was that Claudia Wells (Jennifer) had been replaced by a different actor.  Her first few lines told me right off the bat - she won't be as good as Claudia.  But I put it behind me and continued to watch.
So Doc Brown sends them all to the Future, but something else happens - Biff comes out to talk to Marty and sees the DeLorian dissapear.  He says, ""What's going on here?"" in a undertone.  That statement was very well placed because you have to keep watching - just because of you wondering what will happen next.
So nest thing you know, Marty and Jennifer and Doc are all in the year 2015 to prevent Marty and Jennifer's son from making a huuge mistake.  Jennifer screams and ultimately faints - what a nervous hunk a junk!  ""What have they done with the old Jennifer?"" I cried.
Anyway, the future is far more futuristic that the soon to come 2015 - yet don't let that stop you.  This opening Future sequence is the best in the movie - hoverboards, an old Biff, Cafe 80s, a futuristic clock tower, special clothes that dry, tie, and zip themselves, and even the 19th Jaws sequel.  If I sound crazy, just watch the movie.
So we see sort of a parralell of events from Part 1 - only adapted to the Future idea.  I thought that was clever.  You also get to see Marty's future family.  But before I knew it, only 40 mintutes into the movie, we left the Future.  I really thought the entire movie would be centered around 2015, but I guess not.  With a little disapointment, I continued to watch.
We come back to 1985, but the Biff from the Future stole their time machine and made himself rich - therefore changing the 1985 Doc and Marty know.  It's a very dark and horrible sequence here and the main focus of all the movie's bad language.  I was a little shock at how they did this, but I moved on with high hopes.
So I come to the part where Doc says: ""Marty we have to stop Biff!"" And then Marty says: ""Yeah, we'll go back to the Future and stop him from stealing the time machine!""  I almost screamed with joy.  We get to go back to 2015!  Yeah!  But I was inturepted by the voice of Doc - ""No, we have to back in the past and find the spot where Biff made himself rich"".
So they end up going back to 1955 - again!  They watch the entire climax of the first film as Marty trys to get the book Biff has that made him rich!  Man that really sucked!  I really expected more of a original climax.  They were doing so well up until then!
So bottom line:  The story was a good idea, but it really suffered because of darkness and a return to 1955.  But overall - the movie gets 4 stars because it is a movie you can like and re-watch.  I am a little sarcastic, but go see the movie and enjoy it!",983318400,,3009,4.094017094017094
363796,5,6301666569,"I must have seen this movie about 30 times, maybe even more than that. It's a incredible movie, and beats Back to the Future I and III, even though here in Brazil most people prefer the first Back to the Future movie, released in 1985. I still can't believe they haven't released DVD versions of these 3 movie classics, and worst, they aren't producing the VHS version of the movies any more! Can you people believe it?? Here in Brazil these 3 movies, released in VHS versions, are still rented a lot and they have recently been re-released in VHS versions. I've bought all three movies, but I'd rather have them all in DVD, even better, in a single DVD combo (all 3 in one single DVD). Well, I hope it happens someday.

363799,2,6301666569,"""Back to the Future Part II"" is an inventive 2nd adventure of Marty McFly and Doc Brown aboard their suped up Delorean, it is not however a great movie like the first film was.  Part II retains none of the charm, warmth or wonder of the first film.  Instead it's an effects filled roller coaster ride of confusing time paradoxes and visual effects.
The film begins as Doc Brown transports Marty and his girlfriend to the year 2015 to avert a McFly family disaster.  This is certainly a promising start.  After some brief exposistion seting up this installment by Doc Brown, Marty ventures into Hill Valley of 2015.  This brief adventure is the best sequence in the film, in fact it's the only sequence that bears any similarity to the charm, wit and awe of Part I.  I'll admit, I loved the future sequences.  Marty from the 1980's, sees flying cars, bizarre people and a ""Jaws"" sequel.
The film soon leaves the future setting and focuses on a sinister alternate timeline which finds Marty and Doc Brown fighting for thier lives and travelling back and forth through time to repair damage to the space time continuum.  This is an interesting premise, however it only hides the lack of a solid story.  In each era Marty visits, he has no time to absorb the surroundings as he did in the first film, and no relationship to establish and this is due to the frantic fast pace.
The film would have been more appealing if the story focused entirely on the future and had Marty help his children.  It would have served as a good counterbalance to the first film and be more appealing visually.
Overall ""Part II"" is NOT a bad film.  It is filled with inventive plot twists, action and great visual effects.  However, knowing how great the first film was, there was no reason for ""Part II"" to have been so disappointing.",972172800,4,1810,4.569659442724459
363860,3,6301666569,"The first Back To The Future was a blast, this sequal is only very very good. The movie begins where Part I left off, when Marty (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) were about to go on a date when Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd comes back from the future to tell Marty about his family's future. It pretty much continues from there (just don't wanna spoil the movie!) The future they go to is pretty much what people from 1985 would expect the future to be 30 years onwards, so there's not many suprises, just a matter of common sense really. It works better towards the end when it leads to Marty and Doc. going back to November 12th 1955 (remember that date?!), when all the action colides with the action from Part I.
But as you know, there's another sequal to come, so there's a cliff-hanger, which can drive you crazy (just like in 'Friends'), especially in a movie. Though it makes you think about what's going to happen in Part III. Obviously, Marty goes back to the Old West, so that's a starter, but believe me, it'll be nothing like what you imagined!",972086400,,1084,4.47979797979798
363861,5,6301666569,"There are very few sequels that live up to the standards set by the original. Only Toy Story 2, The Empire Strikes Back and this one are great compared to the first in the series. I would even have to say that Back To  The Future 2 is better than part 1. When Marty finds out ther's trouble for  him in the future, he, his girlfriend and Doc Brown go to 2015 to see what  their future will be like. But when Marty buys a sports almanac, Biff gets  a hold on it and when they go back to 1985, Biff rules all of Hill Valley.  So they must go back again to 1955 and then they find the almanac and burn  it.  But before they go back, Doc is struck by lightning in his car and  sent back to 1885. Now Marty must be helped by the 1955 Doc to get back- to  the future! The #1 reason why I liked this one better than the first is  because I like the graphic description of the future (which is more like  2115 than 2015), and that I would've bought that sports almanac too. What  will happen next? Will Marty go to 1885 or safely go back to 1985? Find out  in part 3!",964569600,,1059,3.892523364485981

This one  is another fun adventure in time. This film is said to have a complicated  plot, it does but if you pay attention its not to complictated. This film  takes from Part 1's end in 1985 to 2015 to a hellish 1985 and then back to  1955 to try to fix the future. Its fun and like the first has a great  design, with all the different times.

363863,4,6301666569,"It's enough to make me get a DVD - the first movie in this triology is being reintroduced in DVD, and the VHS is not for sale.  Fortunately, I went and ordered all three in VHS format 'somewhere' - but this is our  favorite family movie, so we are going to need the DVD version!
These  movies are GREAT for the whole family to watch - we did these as a marathon  one week-end, and was it fun.  The first one is still the favorite, but  that's because it lays the groundwork for this one and the next.
Just  when we think everything is safe, Doc shows up again at Marty's house and  tells him he has to go back to the future (in the first movie, they went  back to the past and then back to the present, which is...well, nevermind,  just watch it and you'll understand).
They really do go to the future,  where things are getting really messed up.  Marty's father is dead, his  mother's married to Biff, his own son is a throw-back to Marty's father's  wimpy days, and his daughter -- suffice it to say, Michael J. Fox would not  make a pretty drag queen.
How things got so messed up (really, because of  something Marty did in the past), and how Marty attempts to unravel is,  brings us not only to the future, but back to the original movie, where  Marty has to avoid running into himself.
When you can get the first one,  grab the trilogy, pop up some corn, sit back and enjoy.
This whole  series has made it to our family library, movies that we want to own  (because watching once just isn't enough!). Movies we pay to keep have to  be  entertaining or educational to grown-ups and kids, both.
Just a  little heads up for parents of young kids -I was surprised in watching this  for the umpteenth time, but with a mom's eye and ear, to hear several  really unnecessary cusswords scattered throughout all three movies. Oh,  nothing to bad, but they could have been left out entirely.  My 8-year  old's eyes popped open - he knows that swear words are kind of a lazy  person's short cut for saying what they want to - usually used by those low  in vocabulary, weak on creative expression - but we just frowned a little,  scratched our heads, and decided not to worry.
