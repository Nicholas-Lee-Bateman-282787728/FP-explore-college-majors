8428581,1,B004GAXKLQ,"I have been watching cycling events on TV ever since they started presenting them, most likely either in the mid to late 80's or early 90's.  Obviously Phil Liggett and Bob Sherwin figure prominently in their coverage and commentary.  I came to find that the 1994 TDF, specifically, Stage 11 was one of the most engaging and exciting hill contests ever.  Having the need to see this again, I ordered the 94 TDF Indurain Remastered DVD.

Boy, was I extremely disappointed.  Two major items:  1) the coverage of each stage is extremely cut-up, most likely for time's sake.  The DVD Stage 11 seemed to be just a brief news broadcast rather than showing a little bit exiciting cycling history originally presented by Phil, really getting into the climb competition between LeBlanc and Indurain.  This DVD does absolutely NOTHING to either cover the detail nor enhance viewing enjoyment.  Exactly the opposite.  Sad story!!!

2)  MUSIC (???) - Who the heck added that???????????  Dumb idea.  As a ex-racer and current club fast tour member, music ruins the coverage, not to mentioned that manufactured stuff that came with DVD.

This particular DVD was extremely disappointing, and wouldn't even consider buying anything else in the series.  Good luck.",1294876800,,1247,5.03921568627451
