3611869,5,B001GKJ2DY,I actually saw this movie 3 times at the theater and enjoyed it just as much the 3rd time as the 1st. You smile the whole way thru. You just know that the cast had a terrific time making the movie. Looking around the theater I could see the majority of the people's heads bobbing with the music and as I sat there at the end and people were leaving they were actually singing along with the music at the credits. This is just a flat out FUN movie that left you feeling GREAT.,1225497600,46,475,4.0638297872340425
3611870,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I sometimes wonder what movie the critics see because it rarely if ever matched the movie I see. I paid to see this movie five times and took my daughter four of those times, we LOVE it. I makes you feel good, the music gives you energy, to me the movie made me feel young and hopeful. The loctaion it was shot in was breathtaking, the chemisty on screen was wonderful! When it first came out it was not a trailer that grabbed me and I really had no interest in seeing it, but a friend of mine invited me and my daughter to go with her one night, and I am so glad we did. I shudder to think I almost missed one of the best big screen experiences I've ever had.",1225497600,147,660,3.969924812030075
3611871,4,B001GKJ2DY,"Saw the play in London, New York and D.C. and loved every minute!
Saw the movie when it came out this year and thought it was every bit as exiting as the play/musical. I simply can't wait to own the DVD when it is available!",1225497600,9,224,4.0
3611872,5,B001GKJ2DY,"From what I know of the history of this play/movie the two ladies that worked so hard to get ABBA and others to put this together in GB are now two of the wealthiest women in England - and from what I have seen it drives the critics nuts, (""lousy, bad camera work, Brosnen can not carry a tune etc., etc.,) the bottom line folks, this movie fits like that old comfortable shirt your wife (the critic) wants you to throw away because it looks ""awful"".  Well, the heck with em, I like my shirt, and I like meatloaf and mashed potatos, and I like Mama Mia, maybe it is mind candy, maybe it does not reach the high brow standard, but it ""feels good"" so the pundants can take their ""expert"" advise and put it where ""the sun don't shine"", this movie makes me smile and who knew Meryl Streep could sing like that - the ""Winner Takes it All"" maybe very poorly filmed according to the so called experts because the one I saw said ""get me off the Merry-go-Round"" but it sure sent chills down my back - let the experts rave - I know what I like, and this film made me laugh - in times like these I will take that any old time over what the high brows think I should see!

PS - as for Mr. Brosnan's singing and why he did the film - straight from the horses mouth -

Q. What drew you to this movie? A. My agent called and said, ""Meryl Streep, Mamma Mia!,"" and I said, ""I'm in!"" I didn't even know who I was playing. I kept thinking, I want to work with this wonderful actress.

Q. How did you fare with all the singing you had to do for the role?
A. I've never done anything as orchestrated or musically complex in my life. At first, I just made noises. Then I went to London and trained in the studio with Benny [Andersson] and Bjrn [Ulvaeus] from ABBA. My family let me know that they were very worried for Dad when they first heard Dad sing. But sing I did.",1225411200,543,1848,4.068681318681318
3611873,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Enjoy the music, laughter, greek islands, and cute boys. This is the number 1 musical for me. I loved the movie and have seen it five times in theathers. I am glad to know ""the dancing queen"" is coming to dvd because I am 17 this year. My favorite song in the movie though is ""Does Your Mother Know."" I am getting really dizzy and I am not broken hearted anymore. I recommend anyone to see this and own it. I knew it was going to be on this special 2 disc DVD. I hope you get wild and let feel it. I think everyone is the Dancing Queen!! What special features I know will be deleated scenes, behind the scenes, and many other fabulous moments at the making of this film. Meryl Streep has brought the role of a women to be strong, funny, and always having that feeling of being young again. Remember to SOS this DVD. Chao!!!",1225324800,19,823,4.15

Meryl Streep is clearly a few voice lessons short of ""Into the Woods,"" Pierce Brosnan isn't even trying, the plot is nonsensical as are the song choices and placements, it's entirely unfunny and the absolute stereotype of a bad chick flick. One could argue that the music is good, but the singers are all terrible at delivering it.

Sophie is getting married, and she was raised by a single mom. She wants her father to walk her down the aisle, so she invites all three of her possible dads to the wedding in the hopes that she will know which one she is related to. Sophie's mom, Donna, has no biological family, as they disowned her when she became pregnant out of wedlock. Her friends Tanya and Rosie have become family to her as a support system. Sophie's dads, Bill, Harry, and Sam eventually come to decide that they do not need to know which of them is her biological father because they have all formed relationships with her as father figures. Sophie calls off the wedding because she realizes that having the wedding just gave her something to prove, not more love for her fiance, Sky. Sam and Donna take advantage of this calling off to get married, because they have already paid for the entire thing. Then, Rose and Bill end up together because they have both been lone wolves and are finally ready to make a pack of their own.

3612005,1,B001GKJ2DY,"Despite the great songs of ABBA, this is an example of non-musical actors trying their best to be musical.  While Streep can decently sing surrounding her with two other actresses (who are excellent actors) who equally aren't musical actors don't really help (Sorry, Christine and Julie).  I kept thinking - why not get Bette Midler as a co-star.  As great as Streep is as an actor, her movements as she decently sings her ABBA songs betray her lack of real musicality - so there is one thing she can't do as an actress after all.  After watching this great dramatic actress try to be truly graceful and musical, I now have a greater appreciation for musical stars of the past for how little acclaim (under appreciation) they received for talents that are truly difficult to express on film: Doris Day, Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, Judy Garland.  And then you have the actors - Pierce Bronson almost single handedly torpedoes the film with his so-call singing.  Truly dreadful.  The only worse musical film performance can be found by Lucille Ball in Mame.  I wouldn't have minded his singing being dubbed by some singer because his acting wasn't that bad.  I have the same concerns about La-La Land and their selected ""musical"" actors but at least in that film, the choreography and cinematography were brilliant.",1506038400,,1315,4.860986547085202

3612008,2,B001GKJ2DY,Why was this movie made?,1504915200,,24,4.0
3612009,1,B001GKJ2DY,"---Sorry, folks, but this was---beyond a doubt---the absolute WORST FILM I have seen since, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" I did a double-take when I saw a ""74% approval"" rating for this hideously awful, poorly directed, waste of good cellophane...WHAT on earth could my fellow reviewers be THINKING?!?

---First, a few truths: 1) I LOVE the music of ABBA (yes, it's kitschy---but, it's GREAT kitsch). 2) I LOVED the Broadway production of ""Mamma Mia,"" (which I saw shortly after it premiered), so my --REVULSION--toward this film does not lie in its source material. 3) If ever there were a movie more hopelessly miscast....I can't think of one.

---Criticisms: The most obvious criticism is the one that confronts  the viewer the moment Streep's face first appears on the screen: like the majority of the cast, she is simply MUCH too old for the part ---and worse--she looks it..... Instead of a still-youthful, 38-year-old, mother of the bride (as the script calls for), who, throughout the musical, is supposed to rock to the tunes of her school days (almost indistinguishable from her younger self), we are treated to a post-menopausal granny, displaying many of the physical limitations of her years--while gallantly attempting physical challenges that are simply beyond her age....

---Despite the generously-cut wardrobe, hair extensions, lighting tricks and the magic of the best make-up pros in Hollywood, it is simply impossible to ""suspend disbelief"" --to the tune of 20 years. Compounding this, the actresses chosen to portray Streep's ""girlhood friends"" and former band mates look, if possible, even older than Streep (this was so obvious, that one gets the malicious conviction that they were chosen precisely BECAUSE they might make Streep appear younger, in comparison).

---Streep's ""former beaus,"" in this production suffer from the same issue---although all three men appear to be (and are, in fact) ten years' junior to the women....In fact, this type of ""age miscasting"" is such a basic ""No-No"" in filmmaking, I can't shake the strong conviction that, like certain Golden Hollywood divas of yesteryear, Streep was humored by those who should have known better, but who stood in awe of her institutional icon status in the industry....Perhaps a self-deluded, last desperate grasp at youth drove Streep in her insistence to play a role that every professional around her must have known she was grossly ill-suited for...I don't know...All I DO know is that watching these silly women--who were long past the ""mommy"" stage, long past the ""granny"" stage (hell, the ""band mates"" looked as if they should have had ADULT grandchildren), attempting to ""rock it,"" was more than I could bear (after the first ""group number,"" I will admit to having ""fast-forwarded"" through every subsequent number those ridiculous-looking women performed)...

---After the disaster in casting, every other negative in the film appears mild in comparison---beginning with the amateurish and gaudy direction....REALLY? Garish lighting, combined with film shots and editing techniques largely confined (thank God) to the '70s was deemed a ""winning technique?"" (And, NO---the director was NOT attempting to ""mimic"" 70s-era kitsch); she TRULY felt she was engaged in ground-breaking film making, according to professional critics who spoke to her during production (perhaps that is why this was the first--and last--major production she has been engaged in)...

----MINOR issues (in comparison to the two former) are things such as: an absolute lack of musical ability (singing or dancing) in Pierce Brosnan....Ham acting in the extras which would make a pig ashamed....And, resting over the entire, rotten edifice, the noticeable CONVICTION from the actors involved that they were engaged in a ""great"" project, personally chosen by a ""great"" actress (well...two out of three ain't bad: Streep IS a great actress---usually possessed as well with a sense of which projects suit her abilities best (rather than choosing ""Mama Mia,"" Streep would have been far better served by a good psychoanalyst---and a prescription for estrogen replacement therapy)...

----Final analysis: Run---don't walk---AWAY from this pathetic waste of: 6,000 heartbeats and 1,200 respirations that will NEVER be recovered...",1504828800,2,4284,5.4122938530734634

3612082,2,B001GKJ2DY,"Girl writes 3 men she knows her mother dated the year she was born to invite them to her wedding. Her thoughts are that one of them has to be her fathers as she never knew her father. And she wants her father to walk her down the aisle. They show up thinking that the girl's mother invited them, and they all are fond of her mother still (which is odd given one of them is now gay). In the end she never finds out which one is her father as they all accept her as their daughter and she accepts them as all her father (gag). She also decides not to bother getting married as she and her bf just want to go experience the world (double gag). All of this ending stuff (and much more nonsense) take place literally at the wedding as the couple stands before the minister reciting their vows.

So in other words it is a real family values picture. NOT. Just more liberal confusion being projected upon vulnerable youth (I assume that is the audience for this movie) so that they can continue being miserable and gripping for the rest of their lives. They try hard to project the ""let's do whatever we want and do nothing and we will be happy"" idea which is of course not reality. They throw the guy coming out of the closet and finding his young Greek bf in the mix. People just dancing around without a care in their minds . . . world . . . . Again not reality. The movie is a musical of course. And while Streep and Baranski can sing they were miscast in this movie. Baranski is too operatic for this role and Streep is too 70s elevator musical for this role. I have no idea who the short woman is. . . the British woman. She was just all over miscast here. Just stupid. Not goofy funny stupid. Just stupid. Speaking of British . . . it is overwhelming British accents you hear. And Brosnan cannot sing. His solos are just painful. Sad too. Also I hate when the sun is out and the movie makers do whatever they do to make it look night time . . . but you can see the sun shining off the water and the actors' hair/faces.

The one star is for this as a product and not as a movie.  As a movie I'd give it 3-4 stars.",1496793600,7,766,4.291666666666667

3612115,5,B001GKJ2DY,one of my favorite memories is watching this movie with my mother. the characters are each wonderfully unique and the twist at the ending makes the movie all the more wonderful. the songs in the movie are always able to put a smile on your face,1496448000,,244,4.326086956521739

Funny, spirited, sing-along kind of movie.  Happy, joyous, makes you think about what matters in life.  A total hit.  And I love that the actors sing their own songs.  They hit every emotional note and I don't care if they aren't professional singers.  Pop some popcorn, Mamma, call your daughter(s) and make a night of it.

3612139,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I love how there are so many people giving this movie bad reviews simply because of the main actresses political views. The writers of the songs, who also had a hand in the original Broadway musical, helped to create this movie, for everyone saying that the original creators would be embarrassed by this movie.

Anyway, this is a great film. I have never seen the Broadway musical unfortunately, but this movie has made me want to. A majority of the cast are great singers and those who aren't, are meant not to be and it brings great comedic relief as intended. I really want to vacation at this resort!

Fans of ABBA will cringe; young people who never heard of ABBA will never want to after these bad Karaoke remakes. To top it all, Meryl Streep [along with her three back-from-the-grave boyfriends], too old to be the grandma of the lead actress, does a poor job of playing her mother, a worse job with her ""singing,"" and shows why so many people agree that she's overrated.",1491350400,,687,4.781512605042017

Horribly miscast w/actors who can't sing ( why why WHY when there are plenty of actors w/great voices)...only a couple of exceptions. 60% of the casting is totally off base.  As Rotten Tomatoes put it.....never good when the cast is having a better time than the audience.  That pretty much sums it up.  I rewatched it again the other night (it's been years since I watched it the first time)...& was just disgusted with how badly they messed it up.

3612158,1,B001GKJ2DY,"Poor quality product. The  volume had to be raised and lowed as the disc played, there were a few places where the picture quality blurred.  The website had a misleading description, the site said factory wrapped / direct from the Studios.  After viewing the movie I suspected it must be a knock off product.  When I was inspecting all the printing on it I found it had stamped on the bottom back, over the clear wrap a difficult to notice disclaimer.  "" DISC MADE  N NEXICO"" I did not make a typing error, the I was missing, half the M was missing, the top of the D, the E was barely visible, also the O was barely visible.  I considered the price as low because it was not a recent movie, nor a blockbuster, I did not think it was because of quality.
I will go to a bookstore next week and see if I can purchase a ""decent"" copy.  I consider my self burned by Amazon and I have gotten the message, buy at a store where you can inspect the product.

The true reason for this musical is the music of ABBA, and the true reason for this version is to see Meryl Streep take the part of Donna and run with it!  What is really endearing is that the actors do their own singing.  The fact that it is filmed in Greece does not hurt it one bit!

3612371,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I'm not a fan of musicals at all.  The only musicals I can tolerate and actually like you can count on both of my hands.  Mamma Mia is in that list.  It's fun, bright, happy, uplifting in scenery location and the music.  The music sounds good and it's got a good beat with great melodies and harmony.  They took a popular group in music history like Abba and they're performing those songs into a story with this gorgeous backdrop and great acting.  Then you add Meryl Streep to that mix and wow!  She's incredible in everything she does and this is no different.  You can't keep your eyes off her and how she fills up a screen with her vibrant energy.  She's got an entertaining supporting cast that rises to the occasion with her from Christine Baranski, Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters, Stellan Skarsgrd, Colin Firth, to Amanda Seyfreid.

We turned it off a little early, but we watched it until it got past the wedding scenes hoping it would get better without Brosnan singing again.  Normally I like musicals, so I gave this a chance.  I am NOT a fan of Meryl Streep, but it was not her fault the story was so very lame.  These other reviewers were right about one thing.  Brosnan cannot sing, and all the voice training in the world would not give him a pleasant singing voice.  He was a good sport and tried, that is all I can say.",1472601600,3,565,4.036036036036036

3612474,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1192,4.8

From reading Meryl's diary, Sophie discovers three potential suitors that were involved with Meryl the summer she was conceived: Harry (Colin Firth), Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), and Sam (Pierce Brosnan). Sophie invites all three, without Meryl's knowledge. Sophie was thinking she would instantly recognize her own resemblance in her biological father, but there were no obvious signs. All three men are convinced they are her father and each insist on walking her down the aisle. Twenty-two of ABBA's hits joyously celebrated.",1464912000,2,685,5.411214953271028

3612524,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I love Abba, but I hated this play and this movie.  So much that I started an online support group called ""People Who Were Hurt By Mamma Mia."" At its peak, the group had 82 members.  My friend talked me into seeing the movie even after I hated the play.  He agreed that, if he thought it was really bad, he would pay for my ticket and for a nice dinner.  When we walked out of the theater, he handed me the money for the ticket and said ""Now where do you want to eat?"" To this day, when he asks me to do something that I strongly think will be terrible, I just say ""remember Mamma Mia?"" and the discussion ends.  So I guess sitting through the movie got me a nice dinner and out of a lot of other crappy shows.  Still, one star is generous for this debacle that does its best to destroy a lot of great songs.",1462752000,,808,3.95679012345679

So the devoted, hardworking mom, it stands to reason, would respect herself enough to protect her daughter from living the same degenerating life she found herself in.  Her life was fraught with complexity but could it be possibly from a life of jumping in bed with man to man?  Yes, just a story but not truly something we want our daughters mimicking  Horribly disappointing!  We had to fast forward to stomach the story line.  The acting was fair, the music fun, but the story was so far from true that I would sooner cry ""Mercy!"" than watch that or recommend it to anyone.  The ending is heart-wrenching.  I could never be happy with a man thrilled to commit to nothing but sex.  Wow!  Great job, Meryl Streep and Colin Firth...",1462060800,2,774,4.550724637681159

3612660,4,B001GKJ2DY,"I have seen ""Mamma Mia"" on stage three times and loved it so when the movie version came out on DVD I couldn't wait to purchase it, if only to hear Meryl Streep sing.
I very much enjoyed this cinematic version of the play, though not quite as much as when I saw it on stage. I'm not sure why that is, though it probably has something to do with the fact that the sweeping vistas in the movie were a little distracting. On stage, the audience focuses on the actors, the singing, and the dialogue. On the screen, the eye is drawn not to the actors as much as to the beautiful scenery that surrounds them.
That said, Streep does a wonderful job as the mom who has never quite grown up and the rest of the cast does the movie proud. The scenery is, as I said, spectacular and the cinematography does it justice. The direction is smooth, the dance numbers are well choreographed, and the costuming is very well done.
A solid 4 stars, maybe even 4.5.",1456099200,3,944,4.25
3612661,1,B001GKJ2DY,"This movie was probably the most boring 30 minutes that I ever spent.  I had to turn it off at the 30 minute mark.  A movie completely devoid of any substantive plot or memorable acting.  All the singing parts were boringly predictable and not very well executed.  If this is an example of America's attempt to produce a quality fun musical, God help us. We have reverted back to high school mundane music mentality.  The insertion of very ""loud"" intermissions of a meager attempts of Rock music between spoken parts completely ruined any hope of a redemption for the plot line!",1456012800,5,578,4.683168316831683

The songs are so upbeat and fun that it draws the viewer in  ...  song after song after song ...  Streep is amazing as usual,  and a couple of the songs she sings portray her feelings well..  Unfortunately Pierce Brosnan's singing pales in comparison,  but one quickly forgives that due to his appealing character and the high quality of the film from beginning to end.  The story line is good,  the dancing is fun,  the scenery is beautiful  ...  whenever I need to lift my spirits or just to relax and enjoy,  I pull out this film.

Pierce Bronson is the only non-singer, and he tries really hard.  He's pretty to look at, but his singing doesn't make it, I'm afraid.

Torrid affairs with three men (at three separate times, within a few weeks of each other), leaves Sophia inviting all of them to meet her father (WHICH ONE!) for the first time so he can give her away at her wedding.
Unbeknownst to her mother, of course.
The whole ABBA soundtrack makes you groove and dance along, and so what if some of the actors can't sing on pitch or key, I felt that made this movie way more realistic, and kept me from feeling bad when my own voice cracked or fell short.
The story is great, the acting is wonderful, and I've made this movie one of my go-tos for anytime I'm feeling blue and need to be reminded that I am the ""Dancing Queen!""",1436054400,,753,4.2727272727272725

It was so amazing that everyone in the cast sang their songs, even Pierce Brosnan who was off to the point you wanted to say, ok that's enough!.  But at least he tried.  Loved the ending but still don't know who Sophie's dad was. Love Meryl Streep, she just takes over any role she plays. Of course then there was Colin Firth!! and a whole bunch of other great actors. I can recommend this movie if you want to hear great ABBA songs again. The plot is kind of interesting but like I said we still don't find out who the dad was.

3613008,5,B001GKJ2DY,The movie arrived on time and unharmed. It was a fun movie. We enjoyed watching it. The plot reminded me of an old black and white movie starring Sophia Loren and Telly Sevalis about a single mother in Italy after WW II who boarded three American soldiers during the war and hit all three up for child support without them knowing about each other until their unit held a 20 year reunion in her town. Loved the playful character of the movie.,1431561600,,442,4.402439024390244

3613012,3,B001GKJ2DY,"I am a huge Meryl Streep fan but was not thrilled with this film in any way.  Ms. Streep is always great in whatever role she plays but I thought her miscast in this type of film.  She is capable of playing comedic and musical roles, however, I found this far too light for her talents!  It's the film I don't particularly care for and even though many loved the long running play and the film...I'm just not one of them!  A bride-to-be, Sopie, played by Amanda Seyfried, is looking for her birth father to walk her down the aisle and in the chaos of preparations and invitations, the three possibles, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgrd and Colin Firth show up for the wedding. Her mother, Donna, played by Meryl Streep, who once fronted the singing group, Donna and the Dynamos, is beside herself when they all appear in time for the week-end, Greek island wedding. Many private reminiscences, in flashback, occur for each of the main characters and it's all interspersed with tunes sung by ABBA!  I think the all around stand-out performance, belongs to Christine Baranski, as Tanya, who was one of Donna's Dynamos and still a good friend.  Julie Walters, as Rosie, brings up the rear as one of the old trio and is also pretty good in her role.",1431475200,,1244,4.581081081081081

However, the bluray disk had a small, deep scratch on it that someone hid with a single smudged finger print on the disk... a sticky one that had dried on it... I cleaned it off with a dvd cleaner and microfiber cloth... and, only then found the deep scratch! It plays okay enough, my bluray player can handle it, but I paid for a brand new Bluray DVD, Not used or damaged... nor one that someone had intentionally tried to disguise a scratch from the buyer upon receipt... mine should have been placed into a used pile and replaced with another before being sent out. Poor choice on their part. I am disappointed when someone acts dishonestly with a customer, especially when I am that customer. I always strive to keep all my DVD's in perfect, scratch-free condition... I don't appreciate receiving them.",1429747200,,861,4.671052631578948

He can sing, but he shouldn't have in public -- and even in this corny film, his acting corn is over the top.  Ouch!  Christine Baranski, on the other hand. makes great use of her Broadway divadom.

3613231,5,B001GKJ2DY,"The film is art of the finest order.  First, needless to say, the music of ABBA transports the soul to a world of infinite joy and understanding.  The Buddhists call it Nirvana, but I call it Faltskog.  The dulcet tones of Dancing Queen will bring you to bliss.  AND NOT JUST THE HITS.  ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT!!!!

Second, it touches on the breadth and depth of the human experience, such as ""what is love and why do we pursue it?"" and ""is there a God and does she love us?"".  Youth can learn from this.  Today's movies are all about sex and guns.  But what about love I ask you.  What about what binds us to our fellow man.  These are the topics that this film broaches.

Finally, the weight of those voices allowed me to soar to the depths of the ocean.  Pierce brought it.  He might not be the best voice, but if you imagine a trained singer singing it, not bad.  Also, Skarsgaard is a true talent...and in case you were thinking I forgot, Meryl is a Siren pulling us toward that ocean where they sail.

Would have been a 10 star movie, but it could have used more of Amanda's Seyfrieds.  FOR ADULTS ONLY: Check out Lovelace, you won't regret it!!!",1417651200,,1152,4.2592592592592595

3613349,5,B001GKJ2DY,"It's amazing how a rather silly plot can make for such a fantastically fun film. Could it be the music of ABBA and all-star cast that makes MAMMA MIA! THE MOVIE a pure delight to the senses?
The story is fairly simple with one complication. Young Sophie has grown up on an idyllic Greek island with her single mother Donna. Sophie is about to get married and wants to invites the father that she has never met. There is one catch. Her father could be one of three men who breezed into Donna's life one summer. Somehow it all works thanks to the music of ABBA which is woven into the plot.
Donna's life churns with turmoil as she is faced with three men from her past who all realize they are Donna's father. Well, only one can be the father.
MAMMA MIA! THE MOVIE is the film to watch when you need a ""lift"" or a small and a laugh. It is pure joy and fun. Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan. Christine Baranski,  Amanda Seyfried, and so on. Who could ask for a better cast and they all seem to be having the time of their lives in a film set in a gorgeous location. Come on. Admit it.

3613407,3,B001GKJ2DY,"Mamma Mia! does a so-so job at managing to craft a cohesive story using the lyrics of ABBA songs that weren't written at the same time. The songs performed during the bachelor and bachelorette parties are the best parts of the movie, and the bachelors' synchronized dance on the pier wearing flippers is visually entrancing. But it's Meryl Streep's singing that is surprisingly weak (I realize most of the actors are not professional singers but she more than others never seems like she's fully committed to it). This despite the fact she's playing a hippy character that's different than many of her other roles.",1406851200,,614,4.913461538461538

I like the storyline that was built around the ABBA songs. The scenery in Greece is beautiful! I want to go there and plan to do so. It is on my bucket list.

3613491,5,B001GKJ2DY,"There have been very few ""Feel Good"" movies in the last ten years or so. This one would arguably rank at the top if there were any others to which it could be compared. The visuals of the beauty of the Greek island setting are breath taking. The music of ABBA speaks for itself. And what can be said about Meryl Streep except that she is a national treasure. Consider the variety of characters that she has played in the last five years or so, each one to virtual perfection and what more can be said. Now we know that she can even sing and dance acceptably. Streep, with her two contemporary gal friends and former performer associates; Christine Baranski and Julie Walters are delights. Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard are the substantial male foils. For the younger set, Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper are the eye candy, but, are not in the least, shallow characters. And the Chapel on the hilltop peninsula with its long stair way to climb is real, and can be found and seen on the island of Skopelos, Greece.",1398124800,,1035,4.56989247311828

3613502,5,B001GKJ2DY,"What a fantastic musical with big name stars ... Even if none of them can really carry a note in a basket ... they make an honest attempt and the ""production numbers"" from ABBA past were fun and well done.

However the movie is a good substitute to get an ABBA fix on the music and the story.  The acting in this movie was very good and the Blu-Ray was super; almost as good as being at the theatre.

The music is great and it is really cool how the screenwriters adapted the complete ABBA album into a movie and the playwrights, a play.

If you can't go to Broadway, then this is a good substitute.",1393286400,,503,4.05050505050505

3613529,5,B001GKJ2DY,"The setting is in Greece, blue waters and warm sand.  The story is of wedding and the brides desire to have her father give he away.  The music is ABBA at it's best.  The actors and actresses are all top of the list.  So much enjoyment you will be dancing and singing along.

Meryl and Peirce make you believe that love can come around again even after 40.  Dominic and Amanda make you believe in young love.  Julie and Stellan make you believe that opposites can attract.  Christine makes you believe that you can find love with a younger man.  And, Colin makes you believe that love should be freely accepted regardless of who it is you are attracted to.

3613534,2,B001GKJ2DY,"I give this musical two stars - one extra because I love the music, but not who sings them.  Amanda Seyfried does a very nice job but Pierce Brosnan, et al ruined it for me.  The story is clearly cheesy and from what I understand, was more or less made to fit already picked music, not the other way around.  Meryl Streep running around with the stringiest hair I've ever seen was not a fun image to say the least.  I can see the empowerment that this movie brings - especially to older women but sadly very few are familiar with the original songs and who sings them.  For example, my mother loved the movie and wanted the soundtrack, not the ABBA singers.  I later had the opportunity to see ""Mamma"" on stage by a traveling Broadway cast and that was wonderful - much more what I would've liked to see in the movie.  The saving grace of this movie is the scenery - GORGEOUS!  I believe it was filmed on location and that adds a depth to the movie that the stage can't bring.  I can't comment on the movie through Amazon Instant Video because I saw it in the theatre.",1391299200,,1068,4.247524752475248

The movie is okay, but Pierce Bronson should never have been cast in a singing role-his voice is terrible.  On the other hand I was impressed with Meryl Streep.

Has to be one of the happiest flicks ever. Have watched it a zillion times. The actors are fabulous, the songs are used to tell a wonderful story; if you have a 'past' it's even more fun!

3613563,4,B001GKJ2DY,"But Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan probably should stick to their day jobs of acting.

I'm not going to review the movie, because I think you either love it or hate it. Or somewhere in between.

I'm just going to critique some technical details.

1. The BluRay implementation was wonderful. The sound is perfect, and the video is in lustrous 1080p. The BluRay extras are fun, especially the director's commentary, which was better than a lot I've heard.
2. There's an implementation of some ""pop-up"" info-bites which you can enable, which gives you some more information. Not my thing, and very distracting. Turned it off.
3. Just a warning about the digital copy. It's SD instead of HD, which isn't what you get these days from most BluRay releases. So this must be an original BluRay version from a few years ago. Disappointing. Also, to download the digital copy you need a DVD player on your computer. I haven't had a DVD player on my computer in 2-3 years, so that made it basically useless.

If you want the BluRay disc because you love the movie, like I do, then this is an above-average implementation. Just realize the downloadable digital content is rather useless with those who have laptops without DVD players, and it's in old-fashioned SD quality.",1387929600,,1261,4.770642201834862
3613564,5,B001GKJ2DY,this is a fantastic movie. I watched the live play and the movie did the play justice. The scenery was fantastic and Meryl Streep wonderful.,1387756800,,140,4.64

It is also loaded with love and loyalty.....I have watched it several times and smile thru it all......not a movie you will get tired of....",1386288000,,259,4.733333333333333
3613573,4,B001GKJ2DY,"On subsequent viewings, although the plot is fine and nicely unfurls, I still cringe at some of the dialogue that (now) 3-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep, Emmy winner Christine Baranski (TV's ""Cybill""), and Oscar nominee Julie Walters (""Billy Elliot"") are forced to recite in ""Mamma Mia"" (more specifically, in about the first 30 minutes), especially after seeing Streep in the, of course, superior ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" a Best Picture winner, which is why I took one star away (I also can't help but wonder what this movie would've been like with, for example, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John as the leads; dare to dream!).  Fortunately, however, there's enough of ABBA's irresistible and enduring music to pick up most of the pieces and to lift the entire cast to feel-good heights, making the cast themselves look like they are having a great time in basically a lavish ABBA karaoke-style party of a movie.  And it also helps that there's no weak link in the ABBA musical catalog, with my personal highlights being the lesser known gem ""Our Last Summer"" and, of course, Streep's undeniably solid and emotionally driven ""The Winner Takes It All,"" right from the side of a mountain!  The rest of the very likable and energetic cast includes Pierce Brosnan, who was unnecessarily chastised by critics for his actually very respectable singing (let's see a critic belt out ""S.O.S."" as good as Brosnan did!), as well as Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, the angelic Amanda Seyfried, and Dominic Cooper.  Another strength is its cinematic message that the older women and men in the leads can carry a movie just fine, thank you (as opposed to seemingly youth-targeted Hollywood).  No one can match the magic of the original ABBA music and singing, but this is probably the closest you can get without a genuine ABBA reunion.  Although it undoubtedly will be labeled a chick flick by most, if you like a feel-good movie with a happy ending, one that makes you want to watch it again and again, this one's made especially for you!  [Nerd fact #1: Executive producers for this film, those who invested their own money in helping it get made, include actor Tom Hanks and his wife/actress Rita Wilson; nerd fact #2:  the two original male members of ABBA make cameo appearances in the film, Benny Andersson during ""Dancing Queen"" and Bjorn Ulvaeus in the final scene that ends the credits; nerd fact #3:  Streep also sang in the dramas ""Silkwood"" (1983) and ""Postcards from the Edge"" (1990); Brosnan also sang in ""Evelyn"" (2002).]",1386288000,2,2523,4.903755868544601

My wife and I went to see a live production of the show just the other day, and I kept coming back to how definitive the performances of this case are for Mama Mia.  It's clear how much fun the cast had making this movie...it had to be a labor of love.

3613591,3,B001GKJ2DY,"This movie has the redeeming feature of having a number of ""name"" actors who are very good at what they do.. However, the storyline itself was shallow. When I saw it at a movie theater shortly after it was released I found myself closing my eyes so that I could listen to the Abba songs without being distracted by the actors. The cast did a pretty good job of singing these songs, and when I had my eyes closed I almost thought I was listening to Abba. For those who are Abba fans, all their great hits are in this musical, and it's worth watching for that reason. For someone who wants to watch a movie with some depth (and who doesn't care about Abba) ""Mamma Mia!"" is not one to take a chance on.",1382313600,,699,4.185185185185185

It's the kind of stupid film which actually IS bad for people. It effectively validates and perpetuates a wholesale disregard of local culture or thoughtful, reasonable social behaviour.  It is about nothing more or less than a gang of self-obssessed rich children playing on someone else's beach, indulging every whim and caprice without the slightest regard for others or their local environment.

What is even more absurd is how everyone talks about this turkey being 'great family entertainment', when it's all about a girl who's mother is such a whore that she had sex with a whole bunch of men around the same time and who doesn't know who her daughter's father is as a result !

3613642,5,B001GKJ2DY,"A lovely, spirited romantic movie set in the beauty of Greece- its incredulous mountains and cliffs overlooking the sparkling blue sea looked down upon by bluer than blue skies. Whitewashed buildings made blindingly bright by the sun. The audience arrives at the scene along with the cast of attendees of Donna's daughter's wedding and the music draws us in to be full participants.

Donna had traveled to Greece as a seventeen year old young woman to enjoy a summer of the sights and carefree life there but never returned home - the consequences of casting fate to the wind and loving freely that impetuous summer.

Her light-hearted, free and easy ways of her youth had abruptly ended with that summer. As the movie begins, we learn that she has lived out her life over the past twenty years in financial hardship, having been disowned by her mother when her pregnancy was found out. The three young men with whom she had had romantic encounters that summer had moved on with their lives and never knew of her strife. Having the good fortune of inheriting a goat farm property on a precarious hillside, she has spent all her money and invested her back breaking labor in trying to restore the place into an Inn from which to draw an income. The reality was it was crumbling faster than she could repair it and no amount of whitewash could cover its decline.

What was planned as a simple village wedding ceremony with plenty of food and drink exploded over night into something quite unexpected as the guests begin to arrive and partake in the festivities. Donna is horrified when the three men - one of which was the father of her daughter - arrive on the scene. They had received invitations from her daughter whose deep-seated need to find out who her father overtakes all caution following finding her mother's diary about that summer and decides to invite the three possible ""fathers"" to her wedding - never really expecting any to come.

This convergence is rounded out by the arrival of Donna's two oldest and dearest friends from her back-in-the-day youth. The friendships of the young bride-to-be and her circle of close friends have their eyes opened to what her mother and friends had experienced in their youth as they provide the entertainment for the ""girls only"" party the night before the wedding by performing their array of disco songs. The young bride-to-be and her friends and the locals are shocked, but totally taken with the freeing tone those songs projected and the whole place goes crazy with everyone joining in along with the three men watching from the edge of the crowd as their old love, Donna, leads the 'playback"" of songs and fun they had each personally shared with her as a young girl some twenty years before in this same breath-taking place.

The ending is a happy one. There is a message we come away with upon leaving the theater. For me it is, ""Take time dear girls to form you own set of dreams. Find out who you are, recognize your talents, so that you can choose a career or path that will be the ""work"" of your life and also the source of what fulfills you outside of a relationship  - before the worldly responsibilities of becoming an adult are laid upon you.

Donna had swallowed the shame she felt in becoming an unwed mother. Rebuilding her crumbling property into an Inn became her life. An impossible dream given her financial resources yet she would not give up. Deep inside her, it represented a dream talked about with Sam back in that summer of long ago. A dream she would not let go of despite his no longer being there to share in it. For all its crumbling conditions, it was home for her and her daughter.

To ensure that unlike her, her daughter would find a safe and happy haven in life. The Rules would be followed! Her wings would be lovingly clipped to protect her from flying away to the temptations of inexperienced youth. A lovely wedding to remember, a devoted husband on which to depend BEFORE a baby came on the scene.... all would come to pass by following the ""Rules"".

While the memories of her daughter and her circle of friends are being formed, Donna's old memories - and those of the three men, come flooding back. They are both whimsical and lighthearted, filled with youthful innocence as they came to know one-another's budding interests and then gave way to their over-powering sexual attractions.  Yet the jarring and sobering realities that followed for Donna in how her life had played out after that summer of unfettered fun is unleashed in emotion as she sings, ""The Winner Takes It All"".

This is definately a ""Chick Flick"". Men will probably not come away with any of its deeper meaning. So see the movie with your girlfriends instead. Buy the CD and watch it alone to have a good laugh and cry when the load dumped upon your shoulders seems too much. Bring tissues because we women will cry when they see the parallels found in our own lives, others will cry for those in our sisterhood who gave up their young dreams and devoted the balance of their lives to making the most of their own dealt hand of reality. It reminds us of how restorative it is when we connect with our old friends and reminisce about the life journey we shared. But the movie's most important reminder is that there is nothing on earth to equal the deep and abiding connection between a man and a woman in love whose main expression of that love is to allow each to realize their dreams and be the support in those endeavors... It is such love that happens in both Donna's life and her daughter's that makes for the movies happy ending.",1375488000,,5602,4.608826479438315

3613673,3,B001GKJ2DY,"Review for 70's disco band ABBA and the piecemeal grouping of their songs into a show - mouthwash to get the sugary taste out of my mouth and reading a book to make up for the lost I.Q. points - not good. And you can't blame the era, because I would argue Tommy by The Who was near the same time period but didn't feel like the equivalent of babysitting a bunch of 11 year old girls. And sure musicals about promiscuity are some of the best and most respected musicals out there, thank you Camelot and Into the Woods, but I guess this did a good job of summarizing the carefree attitude of the '70s decade, which I'm not sad that I missed.
As for the movie I think it was a very good effort on the part of the cast for acting and singing. Meryl Streep had so much energy, at least some of it made it look as though she were genuinely having fun. She and Amanda Seyfried did an excellent job singing for non-singers. Most of the principal males had a little trouble with their songs, but they were pretty well perfectly cast for their parts anyway, no reason to complain. I get this was about dancing and singing, but there were times when there were close ups of singing and there was too much action. Twitching even? It's hard to be expressive with your face when you should be expressive with your voice, and some of the extraneous movement was disconcerting. A director should have told them to stop wiggling so much during those certain scenes. Even having the actors in question watch a musical or stage performance of a professional singer to learn how to hold their bodies and their faces and appendages while performing might have alleviated some of that.
The chorus was spot on most of the time for comic relief. There was a lot of pleasant and fun humor in the dances. However much of the story involving the older set of ladies was very blue collar humor, and it really made them all the more pathetic. Set and costume design was strikingly good, even if you haven't been to Greece you can get the feeling you've visited from the vibrant seaside decor and colors used here.
Don't think it's spoiling too much to say the daughter makes the ""right"" choice at the end to not go through with getting married, just like her mother did years before her. Good to know we haven't matured past the values of the '70s, or at least they want to relive their glory days.",1372723200,3,2369,4.386363636363637

In the case of this movie, I bought it in 2010 and it easily fits into the Outstanding category - I've had it for 3 years and it I still plug it and watch it on a regular basis. What's not to love, it cinematographicly captures the true beauty of Greece, big name stars and the best music from ABBA.  I would definitely buy it again and highly recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it.",1372550400,,639,4.361344537815126
3613677,2,B001GKJ2DY,"There were times, while watching this silly film, that I thought it might win me over through sheer exuberance.  But ultimately, it was not to be, for it suffers from two jointly-fatal flaws:  the whole is less than the sum of its parts; and the parts are less compelling than watching old ABBA videos.

I'll give one example of how the film works against itself.  ""The Winner Takes it All"" is a heartbroken lament by a betrayed woman as she parrots the cynical self-justifications of her betrayer.  It works (at least for me) because the heartbreak overwhelms the song and exposes the betrayer's self-serving cruelty.  Meryl Streep cannot sing quite as well as Agnetha, but she can act, and she acts her heart out while singing this to Pierce Brosnan.  But it is all for nothing, because the CONTEXT is all wrong.  He never betrayed her - it's all a silly misunderstanding.  And since he never said those things, the cynicism all comes from HER!  Whatever power the song ever had, it simply cannot survive this one-two punch of fake tragedy plus unsympathetic victim.

This happens repeatedly.  Not only does the story fail to add anything to the songs, but it actually works against the ideas or emotions the original songs seemed to convey.  Lyrics make poor sense in light of the plot (a woman singing ""baby I'm still free"" to a man she just met; a woman singing ""building me a fence, building me a home"" about a summer fling where she slept with 3 different men).

I won't pick on the quality of the singing, as some viewers do.  In fact, I think one of the most effective moments of the film is when the two sisters sing ""Chiquitita"" to Meryl Streep (badly, but with feeling!).  On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried sings quite well - but when she sings ""I Have a Dream"" I cannot remember why I ever liked the song.  Frida convinced me she really believed in angels, but somehow Amanda cannot.

Nor am I sure Amanda's renditions are the real problem.  There is something subtly wrong about the context - an aura of sad, sordid despair, thinly veiled by forced joyfulness.  The happy twist that transforms the wedding banquet into a sort of PG-rated orgy, through the magic of Aphrodite, did not quite have the tone of innocent nostalgia that I was looking for.

3613683,1,B001GKJ2DY,"96l reviews!  Are you kidding me?  After the first dozen or so reviews, do the other 949 of you actually think you had something worthwhile to add?  Once any item...book, movie, CD, whatever, has a dozen or so reviews...and a range of ratings from folks with a variety of opinions about it...any more reviews are just ego-indulgence on the part of the writers.  The number of reviews that turn up on for items on amazon.com are stark staring ridiculous.

As for the movie itself, it's not great cinema...or a great movie musical...but if you don't much care if Brosnan can sing or not, and you like ABBA songs, and you're in the mood for a beautiful island and some simple fun...this is one for you.",1371081600,,699,4.56

3613695,2,B001GKJ2DY,"I have seen Mamma Mia on stage and I loved it. I am also a fan of ABBA from the old days when they were popular. I own the original vinyl and some CDs too. Adding that Pierce Brosin is good looking and Meryl Streep is an amazing actress, I expected to love this one. But Pierce is not a singer, and Meryl is NOT a good singer and in my favorite part where the mother of the bride sings ""Winner Takes it All,"" she not only sang poorly but the acting consisted of her flailing her arms around and it was so sad - not in the way the writer/composer had intended, but in a ""gosh, this is pitiful"" way. I will watch it again to make sure, and because I really want to like it. But I am pretty sure it is horrid.",1370044800,2,706,3.8758620689655174

This full screen dvd seems to give me distorted pictures and not as sharp either.  Keeping it, but maybe better to buy a wide screen and use zoom to get rid of top & bottom black bars if you want good quality pictures.",1369872000,,349,4.117647058823529

3613701,4,B001GKJ2DY,I loved the broadway musical and I thought that this movie rendition was done well.  I think that Meryl Streep was a lot of fun to watch.  This is a movie that I can put in when I'm working on other things because it doesn't require my full attention to follow.  Sometimes those movies are the best to keep around.,1369180800,,314,4.2

3613703,3,B001GKJ2DY,I choose this rating because this movie was used and didn't cost much..The movie its self was the same old story about a young whore growing older without knowing who the father of her child was the only difference in this movie and divorce Italian style with sophie Loren is divorce italian style was funny and they didn't sing in each others faces. I found the location very lazy living.  As far as acting Meryl Streep played a better whore in the movie Bridges of madison county. All in all I think I was very charitable with the rating. We won't watch it again..,1368921600,,566,4.4423076923076925

Anyway, I didn't even know it was a musical, hard to believe. This movie is so great, it's a good time, it's funny, it's good forthe family [although my mom didn't particularly like the whole ""sophie doesn't know which teh 3 men is her dad ordeal""] . the music is extremely catchy, this movie movie wil have you coming back for more.",1368576000,,454,4.290697674418604

3613715,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Wow, this is just such a feel good movie.  Bouncy music, perfect casting, a wonderful example of the new trend in having actors acting out the music with their own less than perfect voices, but with their wonderful faces.  Not a false note in any of the performances.",1367366400,,267,4.541666666666667

3613738,4,B001GKJ2DY,"Frankly, I was never a great fan of the music of ABBA in their heyday. However, when I was dragged to the theater to see the stage version of their songs, I was impressed. The story line and songs matched perfectly, the energy of the production was uplifting and the overall effect was joyous. And then came the movie; Meryl Streep singing? Amanda Seyfried who? The movie, though, is quite up to its Broadway beginnings, even with all the Hollywood hoopla, stunning sets and expanded scenery. The women characters are great; Meryl is better than expected and absolutely absorbed in her role, Amanda has an excellent voice and Christine Baranski and Julie Walters ham it up wonderfully. The men however, don't fare as well. Pierce Brosnan can hold a note but sounds like he tearing his throat out. Luckily, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth don't have much to do. Still, it's all wonderful fun and worth watching or owning if you are a fan of musicals, Broadway or Hollywood, as I am.",1365379200,2,983,4.72093023255814
3613739,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Yes, it was campy.  No, Pierce Brosnan is not the best singer in the world.  But, what absolute fun!  And Meryl Streep - well I could listen to her over and over (oh, yes I did!)  I loved the interaction of all the characters and even though his singing was not great, I loved Brosnan as Sam.  The whole cast was a delight.  Will I watch this again - you bet!",1365292800,,359,3.9859154929577465
3613740,5,B001GKJ2DY,My friend got me hooked on this movie. I liked the music from ABBA since high school.

3613763,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I have watched this movie many times now!  It's fast become one of my ""go to"" movies when I'm needing something fun, lighthearted, and entertaining.  And while I grew up enjoying the original ABBA music, my daughter's didn't but they stop what they're doing and watch it right along with me- even singing along!  Teenagers- whoda thunk, lol!?",1362441600,,342,4.862068965517241
3613764,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Very upbeat, like a Broadway Musical.  The actors are having fun, so the audience does too.  Find myself humming the songs!",1362355200,,123,4.809523809523809
3613765,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I love ABBA and was rather skeptical when this movie came out. So I gave it a try and have to say I like Meryl Streeps and Pierce Brosnans performances. Funny, cute musical.
The package deal is great as a gift for the already hooked. The booklet has some insight on the process and the CD has the essentials when it comes to the soundtrack.",1362182400,,340,4.246153846153846
3613766,2,B001GKJ2DY,"I find the overall production of great quality.  The music is chosen from the best of an era.  The reason I did not give this movie/musical 5 starts is because it just never seems to amaze me that such wonderful works of art are ruined due to a few inappropriate words or immoral (and VERY UNNECESSARY) additions of such things as references to homosexuality and other inappropriate items making it unsuitable for people who strive to rise above the everyday rustics of society.  Although it is a brief addition at the end, for me it spoils the entire movie.  As a YHWH fearing soul,  I believe SIN is define through the TORAH.  It is NOT subject to discussion.  Either you believe in YHWH (God) or you don't.  The Messiah, YahuShua (or Jesus for those that know Him by His english nick name)  said, ""If you love me, you will follow my commands"".)  Those Commands are all from Torah.  Therefore, although this production has the potential to be one of the BEST musicals in modern day, for me it is ruined by unnecessary reference to sins.  Perhaps there is some idea that it will encourage more viewing, but I do not agree.",1361750400,,1123,4.532338308457711
3613767,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I love this movie. It is so fun to see and hear actors who don,t usually sing do so. What a fun  movie to see with friends.",1361404800,,123,3.5555555555555554

3613770,5,B001GKJ2DY,"If you like ABBA at all and want to smile a lot this movie is the movie to buy. It has a good plot and the songs go so well adding to the plot. I laughed a lot at all the actors acting in rolls that I never seen them in before. I am sure that they must have had a barrel of laughs and good times making this film and it shows that they did in their performances and the added material on the DVD. As I said, if you like ABBA,,, this is a must to see.",1361059200,,450,3.5555555555555554

3613774,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Light hearted musical of ABBA songs put into a story of mother and daughter conflict. I loved it. Star Studded, but two supporting ladies were very funny, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Very highly reccommended.",1360713600,,218,5.257142857142857
3613775,5,B001GKJ2DY,Wonderful singing and dancing. The cast was also amazing. I would recommend this to everyone young and older to  enjoy this wonderful musical.,1360454400,,142,5.173913043478261

3613777,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Really.  Streep crosses all genres, doesn't she?  I think ABBA's music's great, the fun story is deftly plotted, the characters all interesting, and the singing mostly enjoyable (although Pierce Brosnan is definitely stretching it).  But Meryl Streep is the real reason to watch this.  She's a bubbly hippy delight, dancing around the sets and throwing herself into everything.  This is a great adult romantic comedy for those who find today's young, brooding hipster romances as irritating as nails on a chalkboard.",1359936000,,516,5.320987654320987

3613783,5,B001GKJ2DY,"This is one of my favorite movies.  I love the Abba songs, singing,  and the beautiful Greek island setting. The scene where the mother is singing about her relationship with the daughter always brings tears to my eyes.",1359590400,,219,4.7368421052631575
3613784,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Since I love ALL the major actors in the movie and ABBA's music, I found the film highly entertaining. Merle Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski are hilarious as are Colin Firth,Stellan Skarsgrd, and Pierce Brosnan- especially at the end of the movie when they are dancing onstage together in feathers and spangles! Definitely a movie to lift your spirits.",1359504000,,366,5.116666666666666

3613791,5,B001GKJ2DY,I have waited a long time for this particular movie. I don't know why I didn't treat myself sooner. Fast shipping as usual.thank you Amazon!,1358899200,,140,4.64
3613792,5,B001GKJ2DY,I think the cast did a great job with this classic. It's high energy and a lot of fun. The scenery is gorgeous.,1358899200,,111,3.869565217391304
3613793,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Great music (I actually like that the actors are really singing their own parts, even if they're not professional voices)!  Hokey, funny, fun, it made me cry at times.  Mother-daughter relationships, times of loss and remorse, joy--in general just a great movie.",1358726400,,262,5.214285714285714
3613794,5,B001GKJ2DY,Love the music - poor Pierce Brosnan (probably should never to another singing role but at least he gave it his all) - wonderful dance numbers and just plain fun,1358640000,,161,4.4
3613795,4,B001GKJ2DY,"Wow! I had seen this movie once before and remembered that it was pretty funny. MOSTLY I remembered when a particular star up and started singing! I nearly rolled on the floor laughing.

In watching it again, I was disappointed ONLY that there was more R rated moments than I'd remembered. I just can't let my kid watch it I guess. The movie was still funny. If you like comedy and don't mind the musical format, you'll get a kick out of this one.

It arrived when it was supposed to and is in great shape! Thank you.",1358553600,,517,4.26530612244898

3613804,5,B001GKJ2DY,I love everything about this movie! It is one of the best girl friend/sister night movie to watch. We all get up and sing and dance and make fools of ourselves.,1358294400,,160,4.193548387096774
3613805,5,B001GKJ2DY,Great musical - fun to watch. Would watch over and over again.  Suitable for children ( mostly)  Beautiful scenery. Enjoy!,1358294400,,122,5.05

3613815,5,B001GKJ2DY,"This movie is a perfect combination of light humor, musical, and a little cheesiness.  The cast does a stellar job of singing the fabulous hits of ABBA, one of my favorite groups ever.  I know that some people don't respect the poppy sensation that was ABBA, but their songs range in style and sound, and let's not forget that they are the second most sucessful band behind only the Beatles.  Everybody can't be wrong!  Watch it and see for yourself.  Plus, it's set in Greece, one of the most beautiful places in the world!",1357862400,,524,4.531914893617022

The music numbers were outstanding.  The only other musical I've ever liked is The Sound of Music and this ranks right up there in my opinion - even though the story line isn't near as accomplished.  If you don't like music by Abba you won't like this movie...but if you do, you love it as I do.",1357689600,,467,4.25
3613819,3,B001GKJ2DY,I was thinking it would be better but i still enjoyed it.  Meryl is fantastic.  I love the way the ABBA songs were used.  But my best ABBA movie is still MURIEL'S WEDDING.,1357689600,,171,4.121212121212121

3613825,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I saw the stage show three times and enjoyed it more each time I saw it, but I thought ""Mama Mia"" lost a great deal in its translation to the screen.  I found it to be trying way too hard to be young and energetic, and ended up being merely frenetic.  The movie will fade into oblivion, I think, which is too bad, because there were wonderful actors in it--although horribly miscast.",1357516800,6,383,4.305555555555555

3613827,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I have to laugh at all the self-righteous blowhards who came here to criticize everything about this film! Of course this is not 'Citizen Kane' or 'Gone With The Wind', and it's not meant to showcase the best there is in film-making art! This is a lighthearted, FUN musical, using ABBA's music, filmed in one of the most gloriously beautiful corners of the world (Greek Isles of Skopelos and Skiathos). The film adaptation is very well done, and the movie is pure fun and joy from beginning until end. The actors and actresses are not attempting to outsing the original artists- they are merely lending their own voices and personal feel to the great, classic ABBA songs here. To think otherwise is missing the point. Ignore the naysayers and watch it for yourselves IF you know how to have a good time, that is!",1357344000,,812,4.645833333333333

3613834,1,B001GKJ2DY,First off I really love musicals and ABBA music. This musical is really bad. The only one who can sing is the girl who plays the daughter. Everyone else just looks uncomfortable to be there  - especially Brosnan. The acting is terrible...very campy.  I was actually embarrassed for the actors/actresses while I watched it. It was like they realized part way through filming that since no one could act or sing they should make it as cheesy as possible. I would rent this instead of buying it if you feel you have to see it.....buying it is just a waste of money. It's a just ghastly train wreck!,1356739200,4,595,4.5

3613889,5,B001GKJ2DY,"What if there were a movie that tackled such difficult issues as facing your past, gender norms, feminism, gay acceptance, growing old, single parenthood, economic hardship and lost love?

You wouldn't want to see it, framed that way, and neither would I -- which is reason number 100-or-so that I love this movie: It's so much fun you don't realize that yes, it DOES have a plot, and the issues are pretty dang serious.

Framed around the songs of ABBA, that's quite a challenge. ABBA, like most pop groups, wrote the same love song over and over, and here they are trying to use that one song to tell the stories of 1. A young woman searching for her biological father because she hopes this will make her whole 2. The mother facing the here-and-now of her past free spirit 3. Three men facing whether they are (or ever should be) fathers and whether they'll ever be in love again (and with whom)4. A young man deciding whether to give in to a poofy over the top wedding ceremony against his better judgement because it will make the woman he loves happy.

In the ""classic"" movie musicals, the sets looked like sets--you can see the backdrops pretty well in Oklahoma! and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers--so if the last time you saw a musical it was from the 40s, the real life location here may be jarring. You'll get used to it. I also was suprised--and am pretty much jumping for joy--that the extras they chose are not Hollywood models but people with average faces and figures who know how to dance. (The nice exception is the beach dancing led by Christine Baranski, and let me tell you, it so works.)

And speaking of not overdone, LOVED the singing. Pierce Brosnan is wonderful, ""courageous"" someone put it. He's not portraying a musician. He's portraying a man so overcome with emotion he bursts into song. Meryl Streep, whose voice is wonderful, IS portraying a singer. It so works. Their duets are touching. All the voices are just right for the parts they play.

And if it wraps up a little too cleanly for real life, do I mind? Nope, I wish it were this way.  They all live happily ever after. And that's fine with me.",1344902400,,2133,4.527272727272727

3613928,2,B001GKJ2DY,"The touring musical, MAMMA MIA! now becomes a musical movie. Rated ""PG-13"". Running Time: 1 hour, 48 mins.

Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married in your birth town of Kalokairi, Greece. She wants her dad to give her away, but she doesn't know who her father is. So she invites all three men, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) and Harry (Colin Firth). They think that her mother sent the invitations.
She has not told her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) yet.

Also in the cast: Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper.

 Meryl Streep and Piecre Brosnan singing?  The singing in this musical is mediocre, but you might enjoy the songs which came from the Swedish pop-rock group, ABBA (1972-83).

ABBA was Benny Andersson, Anna-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog, Bjorn Ulvaeus. Their songs were so popular, they were used in 1999 in the touring musical, MAMMA MIA!.

 I did not like this movie too well, but I thought Amanda Seyfried was perfect for her role. She did a wonderful job.

 Option to turn on ""Sing Along"".

  It's a good Agatha Christie mystery. It's not a musical, I promise.",1333065600,,2330,7.332129963898917
3613929,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Momma Mia is one of my all time favorite movies. I love the plot; but more than that, I love the music, which seems to fit perfectly with every scene. However, I do not see the need, or understand why you felt it necessary to have Harry become a homosexual, it does not fit into the movie at all, and seems quite out of place.",1332288000,,326,4.030769230769231
3613930,3,B001GKJ2DY,"First, let me preface this by saying that I enjoy Abba's music. This is basically a group of Abba songs loosely tied together with a charming storyline. Despite its relatively weak storyline, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. I don't remember the last time I saw a movie where the actors seemed to really enjoy themselves. Kudos to the established actors for singing their songs (vs. lip synching) - particularly gorgeous Pierce Brosnan, who doesn't have the most lyrical of voices. That takes courage. By the same token, I was impressed by the musical voices of Meryl Streep and Colin Firth. The vocal talents of young Amanda Siegfried are impressive. Of course scenes of the beautiful Adriatic just add to the enjoyment, as does seeing the always handsome Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan in the same film. So, if you want an uncomplicated movie that just leaves you feeling good - maybe singing a few Abba songs - rent this movie.",1332028800,2,932,4.83125
3613931,4,B001GKJ2DY,I had to buy this for a friend.  She just loves this movie and I was able to buy it in (Blu-ray) much to her delight. It seems you can always find what you're looking for at Amazon.,1330560000,2,181,3.763157894736842
3613932,5,B001GKJ2DY,Very happy with the new Mamma Mia DVD Universal's 100th Anniversary. Very good value-- [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital copy. The price was good too.,1330300800,,141,4.68
3613933,5,B001GKJ2DY,"There's a lot to like in this movie. It has Amanda Seyfried looking like a younger and cuter Cameron Diaz. Then there's the chick-lit comedy that she leads (or tries to), about strange family secrets emerging on the eve of her wedding. Throw in Abba's bouncy music, likeable again now that the disco era is fading from memory. Then add Meryl Streep in a physically comedic role, with Pierce Brosnan and lots of others pulling their weight. You already know that it's going to end up OK - not just in the romantic plot, but as a movie, too.

Lots more makes it work, as well. The ongoing visual gag of the ""Greek chorus"" never palls. A few points really stood out, like the bachelor party descending on the bachelorette party, merging them both into some neo-primitive fertility rite (clothes on, if it matters). But Streep and her co-stars really made this movie. She comes across as a strong and active, but decidedly mature character - as befits a woman whose age startled me when I looked it up on IMDB. Two other I-know-that-face actresses form a trio with her, and come from the same age group. I found it absolutely delightful to see these ladies being honest about their ages in these roles, but still as playful as schoolgirls, even to bouncing on the bed and to resurrecting their years-ago girl band to entertain Sophie's wedding eve. Maybe you have to be of the graying age to appreciate it properly, but it was great to see women of my age (and up) with exciting histories and plenty of goofy excitement in their present days, too.

But, amid all these enjoyable parts, a few stand out. One was that massive dance routine to ""Dancing Queen"" - I laughed so hard that my eyes watered continuously the whole length of it. If you thought that the day of the musical comedy movie ended with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Funny-Thing-Happened-on-the-Way-to-the-Forum/dp/B001BKHU5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</a>, well, you had good reason to think that. New facts just came onto the scene, though, and the musical comedy is back again, at least this once. It's howling funny.

3613935,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I like ABBA music, and I'm in the target demographic, but I cringed continually watching this.  There is a scene right before the wedding where Meryl Streep is singing for several minutes about how she doesn't want to talk, while Pierce Brosnan is standing there in what for him must have been an excruciating reaction shot.  But I also felt he was thinking: ""This is dreadful.  Thank heavens we're filming at a great location and tonight we can get drunk at the taverna in town.""  The acting seems forced and phony, and I could not identify with anyone in the movie.  The idea that a young woman would somehow think it romantic (which is what the bride-to-be expresses in her opening song) that her mother had sex with three different men in succession strains credulity.  The giggling didn't help.  Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.",1327104000,5,818,4.71830985915493

Pierce Brosnan's singing is a little flat at times, but he's always lovely to look at.  Christine Baranski has always been a favorite of mine, a great Broadway pro.  What an angelic voice and beautiful face Amanda Seyfried has. Everyone else is perfect and fun especially the dash of Julie Walters.  The whole movie is joyous.  I also own the CD and again love the words to a lot of the songs, I can remember the visuals of the movie as I'm hearing them while I'm sewing, especially ""Does Your Mother Know.""  Good family fun.",1322870400,2,619,4.473214285714286
3613940,1,B001GKJ2DY,"It's really quite simple: if you're a huge ABBA fan, you're going to love this movie.  If not (I fall into this category), the movie will be torture to watch.

The only reason this musical and movie have such a strong following is that ABBA has a fanbase of baby-boomers that love their music.  Those fans, watching this movie, love the music so much that they are blind to the shallow characters, flimsy plot, and all of the forced, unrealistic scenes.  I had always thought it was backwards and just plain wrong to write a story based on the music of a band.  These fears were confirmed when my eyes witnessed this film.

As a theater major and actor, I have seen countless plays, musicals, and movies, so don't discredit my review and think that I don't know a musical is indended to be campy and corny.  The issues I had with this film had nothing to do with the corniness.  I will hear people say that they can tell the actors were having fun while filming the movie.  Unfortunately, that does nothing for me as the viewer.  Find a Jr. High with a lousy theater program doing ""Grease.""  They too are ""having fun.""

It's possible that my review would be different if the band involved were AC/DC or Paul Simon, but until that movie gets made, I feel I must warn the world that there are better ways to spend your time.",1322438400,4,1322,4.395061728395062
3613941,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Mamma Mia in Blu-ray is breath-taking, scenery is great, sound is second to none. ABBA music is timeless. Pierce Brosnan is a great actor, but should not consider a career in singing. All-in-All this is a wonderful musical",1322438400,,222,4.868421052631579

3613943,3,B001GKJ2DY,"Okay, let me be honest. I had heard about this film/musical for a long time. I thought I'd give it a shot because I like ABBA songs and a good musical. Sadly this film had a stupid plot meant to try and fit in the various ABBA songs they wanted to feature.

I won't comment on the singing which ranges from wonderful to terrible. Bravo for trying and you will also be surprised at who can sing in this film.

I found myself saying, 'Who cares?' most of the movie. I watched it on dvd and fast forwarded most of the second half.

The best songs were at the end of the movie in the wrap up scenes. What were they thinking? Put them in the movie, not at the end when people are walking out.

I think I was just confused at the muddled plot. Very stupid, stupid idea for a movie.",1321228800,,775,4.045751633986928

It will be difficult to stay seated though, as the tunes are very infectious.  My friend and I found ourselves singing along, using a hair brush as a microphone, and laughing ourselves until our sides ached.  So, suspend reality and enjoy.",1317772800,,361,4.59375

(+) it was shipped in an envelope with bubble wrap lining in it. content was great.
(-) it wasn't a blue ray official case (the blue kind). It was a black dvd case, with the mamma-mia cover. Since it was for a gift, I was saddened by that.

Overall good review. I'll read more specifically next time what kind of case it'll come in. If not specified, I'd ask first. :o)",1316304000,,394,4.184210526315789

Great effort was also made to insure the extras in this BD were also blueray quality which many times the studios skimp on, and this BD is full of extras. Enjoy.",1315440000,,362,4.260869565217392

The main character was a manipulative, wishy-washy bitch (and why was and Streep the only ones with an American accent?) The plot... who am I kidding? WHAT plot? At least MOST musicals make SOME sort of cohesive sense! I'm not entirely certain WHY I watched the entire thing, other than it was the soul-destroying train-wreck that, once you start watching, you have to finish.",1312416000,5,492,4.9397590361445785

3613976,3,B001GKJ2DY,"I said it once and I probably would say it until I die, I love ABBA music, I find it infinitely charming. I don't know how this happened, I wasn't born in their decade, my dad didn't play their music as much when I was growing up, none of my musician friends or music idols consider ABBA as one of their inspirations yet I do. And just like I appreciate their music when no one in my social circle does I enjoy this movie thoroughly when not even my fiancee does. Its corny, simplistic, predictable, and has an unrealistic sparkling brightness that makes romantic comedies like ""The Sweetest Thing"" look like serious gritty mysteries. But it's not all fluff, we do have Meryl Streep who has the ability to make the Titanic resurface with her bigger than life characters. Maybe is the fact that the actors spent more time singing/dancing than acting that I felt I was watching a music video. Maybe is the beautiful Greek scenery that brings me back to my youngest dreams of paradise. Maybe I'm just cheesy like that...but this movie is charming, harmless and even though it has enough sugar to make you diabetic, you might just like me, like it. It is definitely a strange zone you step in when you find yourself idiotically singing along to a movie while your fiancee looks at you and says ""That's just gay""",1312070400,,1307,4.5423728813559325
3613977,3,B001GKJ2DY,"I like this movie, but the one thing that I can't figure out is what is a Digital Copy; I have tried to play it in both the Regular AND the Blue-Ray DVD Players and it Doesn't even work, so I haven't a clue to why the Manufactoring Companies insist on putting something in when it doesn't even work.  If and only if it's meant for the Computer, then why don't these Manufacting Companies say that its for the Computer.  I HATE Guessing Games, and these Manufactoing Companies insist on playing Guessing Games with people that know Practiclly Nothing when it comes to such things as a Digital Copy of Any Movie.  If these editodic Fool Harded Companies are going to insist in putting these Digital Copies in with Movies, then in my own Opinion, I would have to say that these Companies / Business's MUST also Include Instrctions in just how Exactley these Digital Copies are to Work and are to be Played!  But will these Compnaies / Business's Include Extreamly Simplafied Instructions in how to go about the Playing of these DIgital Copies, NO they Won't, so why are they Waisting Everyone's Time and Money by Including a Digital Copy of some Movies, when a Percentage { % } of the Worlds Population is 100 % Clueless in how these Digital Copies Work and are to be Played?
  So what I do with ALL Digital Copies of any movie that I get, I Shreed it Up in my Shreeder, for the reason's because One { 1 } it doesn't work, and secondly { 2ndly } I haven't any ideaa to how it is supposed to be played!

3613978,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I have seen the theatrical production 4 times and the movie once.  The movie was terrible!  The movie cut songs that were in the play and destroyed the continuity of the music and story.  Pierce Brosnan might be eye candy, but he can't sing and looked uncomfortable.  Worst of all was the direction by Phyllida Lloyd.  I cannot fault the actors and production for her inability to make the show go.  I recently had the misfortune of seeing a theatrical production of this show directed by Ms Lloyd.  Her version chopped up the music and interrupted beautiful songs with inane conversation.  It was painful to try to sit through this movie.",1311552000,7,639,4.693693693693693

It's wonderful that Amanda's character has three potential fathers. Wonderful story, wonderful music, and wonderful actors/actresses, but it's not a 5-star film.",1311206400,2,291,5.636363636363637
3613980,5,B001GKJ2DY,"The GOOD

- Wow! The music is lovely. It also inspires me to dance. It sounds exactly like the original played by ABBA.

- The scenes are beautiful with the sea, mountain, beach, sunshine and houses on the mountain.

- There are many hilarious scenes too. For instance, Meryl Streep was carried away while singing Mama Mia and fell through a hole. Another is where an older lady flirted with a younger, brown guy. One more is where multiple guys dancing on the pier with their diving fins.

- Out of 18 songs in this movie, I love 13 of them. They are: Honey Honey, Money, Mama Mia, Chiquitita, Dancing Queen, Lay All Your Love on Me, Super Trouper, Vouler Vous, SOS, The Winner Takes It All, When All Is Said and Done, Take a Chance on Me, I Have a Dream.

- According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production Budget was $52 million.
Domestic gross:  $144,130,063
+ Foreign gross  $465,711,574
= Worldwide gross $609,841,637

So it's profit was more than 10 times its cost.

The NOT SO GOOD

- Some of the songs are incomplete or interrupted with dialogues. This is really annoying because I need to listen to the whole song to completely enjoy it. For example, in the scene of Chiquitita song, the last sentence was omitted. It's replaced with the dialogues between Meryl Streep and her two girlfriends. The director should have the song completely sung before continuing with the actors' conversation.
Another is in the scene of Gimme Gimme song. It is broken into 3 pieces by the actors' conversation. That makes it much less enjoyable.

- It does not have Karaoke version. That means there's no scene with only instrumental music. So, you have to sing along. You can't sing  Karaoke.

- Of course, it's a musical film, so, please don't expect any logic and character development.

Well, nothing is perfect. In short, every Karaoke fan or person who loves singing should have one copy. I'm singing along and dancing with this DVD once a month now. It's an excellent showcase of  timeless songs.",1310601600,,1998,4.668571428571428

3614006,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Since I was young I have used music to sustain me emotionally and psychologically.
I remember listening to Beethoven's Third Symphony (Eroica) and Dvorak's New World Symphony when I was feeling down or stressed.  The music would lift me and help me go on.  Recently I discovered that Mamma Mia performs a similar service.

Mamma Mia is an excellent musical.  I remember the musicals of the 1940, 50 and 60s.  Often they had as much dialogue as singing.  Mamma Mia is almost continual singing, and the singing is cheerful and strong.  The music lifts my mood.

Meryl Streep stars and sings up a storm.  I have enjoyed Meryl in so many movies and admire her talent.  Her talent, demonstrated in such varied work as  Sophie's Choice Kramer vs. Kramer and The Devil Wears Prada, did not prepare me for her performance as Donna in Mamma Mia.  Not only is she outstanding in her role, she  sings well.

Several other actors are excellent in their roles.  Amanda Seyfried is brilliant as Donna's daughter Sophie.  Christine Baranski (recently in The Good Wife) and Julie Walters (Famous as Molly Weasley in Harry Potter films), are superior as Donna's best friends and former singing partners.

Colin Firth (Oscar for King's Speech) plays one of Donna's former lovers.  His singing is great and his guitar playing is impressive.

The biggest surprise for me was Pierce Brosnan (James Bond 007) in the role of Donna's first lover.  Pierce can not sing nearly as well as the other actors but somehow we do not mind.  He is perfect as Donna's love interest.

Mamma Mia is an entertaining film with a wonderful musical score.  I highly recommend this movie for a very pleasant evening.",1307750400,2,1674,4.776223776223776

That being said, the daughter in this movie (played by Amanda Seyfried) has an outstanding voice, and as a relative unknown in the movie industry, she pretty much carried the entire movie on her shoulders (musically speaking).  Somebody however, forgot to tell the producers that this movie ""is a MUSICAL!"". So rather than attempt generate box-office revenues from the reputation of high profile actors with bad voices (Streep, Brosnan, Firth), they would have been better off casting actors who can actually act AND SING; doing so may have made this movie as enjoyable (and as profitable) as the stage play.

I would suggest you rent it before buying as it falls into a distinct genre of movie. Several younger members of our family recommended it to us and we watched it and found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of the songs.

Anyway, on to the movie review...I probably would have never watched this film if it hadn't been for the persuading by my 8 year old daughter.  So I reluctantly watched it and fell in love!  I never thought I was a musical fan, but I now relaize that there is absolutely no basis for me to be labeled as such, as I now admittedly, realize that I like quite a few...there's really only a couple I can think of that I dislike.  Mamma Mia! is not one of them.  I LOVE IT!  Some of the singing is not the greatest, but it is still a fantastic movie, and anything with Meryl Streep and Colin Firth in it can call me a fan, pretty much.  It's definitely a chick flick, so I don't imagine many straight male counterparts will be lining up to see this one.  It's fun, funny, romantic, heartwarming, and the music is fantastic!  I highly recommend this one and can't wait to see the stage performance someday.  5 stars!",1299024000,,983,4.264864864864865

3614057,2,B001GKJ2DY,"I like good chick flicks that critics pan. I just like a good fun romantic story, I can't help it. So I expected to like this movie but I was disappointed. If I had seen it in the theaters instead of at home on my DVR and couldn't fast-forward through most of the songs like I did, I probably would have impaled myself on my soda straw.

The songs are way too numerous and often don't fit with the story. It's like they had a checklist of ABBA songs they wanted to cram in this thing so they just stuck them in as often as possible no matter what. At the end of the movie, there are four in a row, count 'em, FOUR songs, with about two lines of dialogue in there. They just roll them off just 'cause. To be fair, most of the singing was pretty good (except for Pierce Brosnan, bless his heart for trying), and it helped when they piped in ABBA-sounding background vocals to all but cover up the movie star who was trying to sing lead, but I just couldn't take one more scene watching Meryl Streep flail and roll around the set in rolled-up overalls. To be fair again, she's not a singer so she didn't know what to do with herself while singing except said jumping around, plus some head-scratching gesticulations, but it was painful to watch regardless.

The female characters were ridiculous. If you go by Sophie and her friends, or Donna and her friends, all women scream and do some ridiculous show tune or secret girl club handshake of some kind when we reunite after having been apart; and we engage in over-dramatic Ya-Ya-esque behavior the rest of the time. One scene with the mom and her friends sounded literally like hens, they were doing so much whooping and weirdness. I found it embarrassing and unflattering to our gender. I know no females (no human beings really) who act like this or who would want friends who do. Why does Hollywood do it?

I watched the whole thing mainly out of curiosity, and stubbornness because I'd be darned if I'd invested an hour of my life into this thing without seeing the end. I liked most of the characters, sure, but they were mostly amusing circus-types and not people I cared about. We didn't have time to connect with them because instead of going into character development, they were forever singing something instead, and the song rarely lent itself to the story.

That said, if you like the following:

*Watching movie stars do mediocre karaoke covers of ABBA songs every couple minutes.
*Women who whoop and holler and do lots of girl bonding over alcohol and sing encouraging songs to each other over (and under) the bathroom stall door.
*Seeing old women sing in sparkly 1970s jumpsuits and platform boots to pretend they're the disco version of the Supremes.
*Greek scenery.
*Fake old photos of Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth elaborately dressed as hippies.
*Seeing old people kiss a lot.

...then you will really enjoy this movie.

Right, so given that list, I did not much enjoy this movie. It seems like it was way more fun for the people to make the movie than for the rest of us to watch it. At least I sure hope it was, or else all those poor people were pretty miserable that whole time. If you want an indulgent-fun chick flick, go watch Leap Year instead.",1297728000,,3224,4.500854700854701
3614058,5,B001GKJ2DY,I don't really care what critics say.  This Movie is so much fun and beautifully done it is a hit in my book.  I am a big fan of all musicals and this one is one of the best.

I love the songs, ABBA 's songs are great and this movie put even more meaning into them. As for Pierce Brosnan's singing ...it wasn't very good, just OK, but it actually made the movie a bit more real if you let yourself get caught up in the story. Not everyone can have a great voice, but the point of the movie was to be fun, entertaining and it made me laugh.  So in this movie he was just an ordinary man in the story singing his feelings, but the rest of the cast singing was great, so for his one song...who cares?... he acted out the movie well. I will watch it again & again...I just wish I had gotten it on Amazon as it costs me about $5 more for it locally. I have seen it twice & look forward to seeing it again & again as a fun, feel good musical with an outstanding cast. Whenever, I need a pick me up I will watch this movie as I find myself singing the songs for a few days after seeing it and it makes me feel good...what more can you ask of a movie. Laughter they say is the best medicine and music makes you feel emotion. So if anyone out there is looking to buy this movie & you want something you'll enjoy,and want to get lost in the fun & joy of it and even if you never heard ABBA songs, you'll want to get this movie.",1297123200,,1373,3.851590106007067
3614060,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I ignored this film when it came out in theaters; just didn't interest me.  I vaguely wondered why an actress of Meryl Streep's caliber would stoop to take such a silly role.

Then one frozen day I made it out of my house to the library and picked up some DVD's to help me make it through the week.  After several sub-zero nights and frozen pipes I was in the mood for something that looked warm and sunny.  The picture on the cover of the DVD was ridiculous but at least they appeared to be dancing on a beach in front of blue water.

Wow!  It didn't take long for the warmth in this film to melt my mid-winter depression.  I didn't see the stage version so I wasn't handicapped by making that comparison.  And I never liked ABBA so I didn't care if anyone mangled their songs.

I admit that I had soured on Meryl Streep, after having been a major fan.  She seemed to have become so mannered and self conscious that I lost interest in her.  But here....another WOW!
This and her performance as Julia Child have reinstated her into my personal fan club.  She is just so filled with life!  If anyone is willing to suspend belief in the credibility of the script, and just go along with the sheer exuberance of the film, they can have a great time.

True, there are lots of ""flaws"" for the serious film goer which is probaly why critics didn't like it.  Besides a silly story, the casting is somewhat strange, especially the three men.  Colin Firth, whom I adored in so many roles, is awkward and looks embarrased for most of the film.  But that is his character!  And I give him credit for putting himself in such an embarrasing position.

Pierce Brosnan is good as the aging cute guy who can't sing but gives it a try.  He is losing his looks but that's good for the role, too.  He's just a guy who made a mistake and has paid for it and now is getting another chance.  The Swedish fellow seemed well cast.

Amanda Seyfried was perfect as the prettiest little gumdrop of a girl you'd ever want to see in a movie.  She was more than a pretty face, too, she acted very well.  The scene where Streep prepares her for her wedding brought tears to my eyes.  Christine Baranski, an actress I never liked, was terrific here.  I loved the bit where she has an almost-romance with an adorable young Black barboy.  Julie Walters was terrific, too.  I was glad to see that each of them had a chance to shine.  The numbers with the three of them performing were wonderful!  So much energy, so much joy!

I can see now why Streep and the rest chose to make this less-than-Oscar-worthy film---for the sheer fun of it!  It really comes across.  A really good time awaits anyone who can open up to sheer, mindless enjoyment.  Intellectual snobs better pass.",1297036800,,2741,4.360396039603961

I read somewhere that Colin Firth has said this movie was the most fun he ever had making a movie.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it is a bit jarring when the songs don't quite fit the situation.  It's obvious that the plot was written around the songs.  Musicals work best when the songs are written around the plot.  But these are some truly inventive, playful and joyful tunes and the choreography is fresh and energetic.

What a surprise!  Lighthearted fun and excitement among the players, music and dancing that uplifts you in spite of yourself.  The writers did a fantastic job of fitting all those songs to the story...or did they write the story to fit the songs?  The ABBA music is really the driving force throughout the movie...or is the story the driving force?  Hard to tell...
Most of the actors did a great job singing and dancing and the story is clean and enjoyable.  I read an interview in which Pierce Brosnen stated that he'd never sang in his life and his singing is proof enough. Even his singing grows on you after a few viewings.  I enjoyed the movie so much I had to order it from Amazon!  Perhaps the cast was not made up of trained singers, but any deficiencies were covered by their super star performances.  Now my 3 and 5 year old grandchildren want me to play it every time they're here.  I even listen to it when  working at the computer or in the kitchen.  I have so much music in the house (I'm a classical piano teacher with degrees in music.) yet, I find this rendition of ABBA's music and the gaiety of the story the most contagious I've heard or seen in years.

I say that and I'm certainly not even a Meryl Streep fan in the least. Still, she proved perfect for the part. As for Bronson not being able to sing that well, that just added to the fun experience! PERFECT!

This movie is about SMILES and FUN and that is exactly what you get in SPADES!!! It doesn't matter if it comes off a little cheesy at times, and as one reviewer said, a little like a third tier production, that just adds color and flavor to it!

For viewers who don't like musicals this movie will not appeal to you either. In my view, you either like musicals or you don't. For the borderline few who aren't sure whether they like musicals or not...this might be the one you want to choose to settle the matter once and for all.

3614085,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Mamma Mia picks you up and almost forces you to smile, laugh, and have fun.  Whether watching it at home with your significant other and a bottle of wine; on an airplane next to some of your closest friends you've never met; by yourself with some tequila; or with a good friend who likes to sing with you, this movie fits for nearly everyone.  Meryl Streep is fabulous.  She bounds, bounces, bellows, sings, and rolls into your heart.  She had so much fun making the movie and it shows.  Her up tempo performance transports you on stage with her.
Pierce Brosnan's horrendous singing brings more mirth and merryment to the experience.  He acts like someone much younger and revels in his inability to sing.  When watching this movie again recently with a friend, we couldn't help but laugh when his character went over the top to try to impress Ms. Streep.
Amanda Seyfried has an amazing voice, especially for someone so young.
And when Ms. Streep and her two friends come out to sing their biggest number, you are going to want to stand up and dance with them.
Yes, it helps if you enjoy Abba music.  You should at least be slightly familiar with some of their biggest hits.  And don't go into it thinking this will be your typical Meryl Streep Oscar-winning, serious role.  This movie is all about having fun.  Hell, if more of us tried to incorporate Abba or other catchy music into our daily lives, we would probably be much happier and laid-back.
So kick back, grab a beverage, cuddle up with your wife or girlfriend -- or watch it by yourself if you want to keep it as your guilty pleasure -- and get ready to launch into a rowdy time.

3614096,2,B001GKJ2DY,"Being a fan of ABBA, I was looking forward to seeing the movie. However, I found the pacing of the movie incredibly slow compared to the stage play. It was, in a word, boring. To add to the disappointment, the leads (Streep and Brosnan) were not up to the vocal requirements of the score (especially Brosnan). While I enjoy them as actors, they needed to have their voices dubbed or at least their performances improved.
The other disappointment was the change of the script towards the end adding the reference about families being of all types. That was not in the original as I remember. That could have been left out. Also, the producers could have left off the tacky ending with the cast parading around in those horrid suits. True, the stage play has that addition but it comes off much better on stage than on screen.

I don't remember much about it but I do remember that the acting WAS rather poor. The story line was good, considering they just took the original and played around with it a little bit to make it good movie material. Notice I say good, not great, material. As for the singing, many who gave this movie a 1 star review mentioned how terrible the singing was. I for one found the singing actually pretty good. Some of it was pretty ear wrenching but for the most part I can't complain. I know nothing of directing so I can't say anything about that.

For a family movie it is a pretty okay present to give to a loved one who enjoys musicals. It is not nearly as good as a classic like The Sound of Music, but it's still a ""going to see eventually"" movie. My friends, and family, all very much enjoyed it.",1279756800,3,1039,4.164179104477612

3614104,5,B001GKJ2DY,"""Mamma Mia! The Movie"", the film adaptation from the jukebox musical by British playwright Catherine Johnson and featuring the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus (both the male members of the group).  In 1999, the musical has brought in over $2.0 billion in earnings (becoming the highest grossing musical of all time)and what better than to have a film adaptation a decade later.

With Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson producing the film, ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" would be directed by British director Phyllida Lloyd and a screenplay by Catherine Johnson.  The film adaptation would feature an all-star cast starring Meryl Streep (""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Adaptation"", ""The Devil Wears Prada""), Pierce Brosnan (James Bond 007 films, ""The Thomas Crown Affair""), Colin Firth (""The English Patient"", ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Shakespeare in Love""), Stellan Skarsgard (""Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End"", ""Beowulf and Grendel"", ""Dogville), Julie Walters (Harry Potter films, ""Becoming Jane"", ""Billy Elliot) and Christine Baranski (""Happy Family"", ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", ""Chicago"") and a film that would jumpstart the careers of Amanda Seyfried (""Mean Girls"", ""Veronica Mars"") and Dominic Cooper (""The Duchess"").

The film which cost $52 million would earn over $609 million worldwide in the box office making the film one of the top 50 highest grossing films of all time and the distinction of the highest grossing movie musical in the world.

VIDEO:

""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition (Widescreen 2:40:1).  ""Mama Mia! The Movie"" is quite interesting presentation.  For one, the film is shot in Greece and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  But there is also an artistic element that cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos brought to the film (Director Phyllida Lloyd goes more into wanting a dramatical effect for the film through experimental shooting during day and night).  From scenes overlooking the ocean at night with the beautiful black and blues, to the shots of the wedding as lights are seen going up to the church area.  Absolute beautiful!

But it's also important to note that Zambarloukos went with colors that are high in contrast at times and colors that may seem a bit oversaturated  at times but for the most part, it added to the vibrancy of the film  and looks incredible on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and comes clear from the front and center channels but the film is obviously going to be musically driven and one is not going to hear an aggressive soundtrack.  Music sounds good but not great as the lossless soundtrack is not as immersive as I would have wanted it to be.  I didn't notice the surround or rear channels being utilized throughout the film.  So, it would have been great if the mix would have incorporated those channels.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I don't think I have enjoyed a movie musical like ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" since ""Grease"".  I absolutely felt that Amanda Seyfried shined throughout this film.  Seyfried is absolutely radiant in this fim and since the theatrical release of ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"", I have been quite impressed by her work.  She's an amazing actress with so much depth and she shows what she is capable of in ""Mamma Mia!"", definitely far from what we have seen of her in ""Mean Girls"" and ""Veronica Mars"".

And Meryl Streep, what a brilliant performance.  It's one thing for Streep to be known as a wonderful award winning actress but somehow there was this synergy that went through the cast and but especially for Meryl Streep, she was electrifying and had so much energy, I was impressed.

The cast was absolutely fun to watch and although some of the talent (specifically the male talent) are not known for singing, I suppose the film brought this naturalness to its characters.

But it all comes down to the music of ABBA, especially if you enjoyed their music in the past.  For me, it was nostalgic as I grew up during the '70s and my parents were part of those disco years and part of my younger life was at home with plenty of people taking part in these disco parties.  So, the music of ABBA didn't bother me and in some ways, some songs really got me interested in how the original music sounds compared to the movie musical and songs such as ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"" surprised me because I thought the music was first created for Madonna's 2005 song ""Hung Up"".

But there is so many things that came together for this film that I absolutely enjoyed.  The location was absolutely beautiful, the editing that helped enhance the musical numbers were well-done and as mentioned, the talents were just enjoyable to watch.  This was an enjoyable film that didn't require any seriousness or surrealistic plot, this was a straight-forward fun, vibrant film with an enjoyable cast.

As for the Blu-ray, there are people who enjoy musicals and I know the music of ABBA and disco may be a bit much for some people expecting something along a similar path of movie musicals such as ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Chicago"" or ""Nine"" but ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is a film about having fun and being in love, and I suppose once can say that ABBA's music embodies that.  This is a gorgeous movie on Blu-ray and some may feel the film was too oversaturated for their taste but I felt that there was a sense of artistry in terms of cinematography.

Overall, ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is a wonderful musical on Blu-ray and if you are into musicals, especially the music of ABBA and want something more lively and fun, definitely give this Blu-ray release a try!  Recommended!",1279238400,7,9140,4.774029280712922
3614105,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I love ABBA's music, but when I borrowed this DVD from the local library I had no idea the story was all written around the music of ABBA. Watched it 4 times, something I never do, and I find myself going to sleep and waking up with the lyrics from Mamma Mia on my lips. Another thing, too: I'm not a rabid dancer. Usually I have to force myself to do it, and it probably shows. But there are few ABBA songs I can listen to without wanting to get up and start gesticulating with my arms and swiveling the old hips. (Sometimes I do!) I don't know what it is about their music, but if you don't want to dance when you hear it, forget it, you'll never be a dancer.

I agree that Pierce Brosnan can't carry a tune, but it didn't bother me too much because I didn't expect him to be vocally talented. He was adequate for the role, probably not his best, but he seemed to enjoy himself nonetheless, and I did, too.

Anyway, I'm sold on the movie, so I'll look for the best deal I can get on my purchase of it. I'll keep it together with my copy of West Side Story. These are the only two stage musicals that were made into movies that captured my enthusiasm. I was really surprised at Meryl Streep's performance. I didn't know she had it in her, having only seen her in heavy dramatic roles.

If the critics didn't like this movie, they should get their TS cards punched, as we used to say in the Army. I can't imagine how anyone could not enjoy the movie, and if people enjoy it, the critics be damned. I didn't find it of inferior quality in any way.

Bottom line, if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?",1278892800,3,1610,4.134185303514377

3614115,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Two facts MOST theater-lovers know early on:

1) Mama Mia on Broadway is the BEST time ever!
2) Movie adaptations of live theater are never as good.

That being said, I have a fresh idea about the recent movie version of ABBA's Mama Mia- FORGET ABOUT THE BROADWAY SHOW! Comparing the stage ""Spectacle"" and the movie is like comparing a big chocolate cake U can eat, to a picture of a chocolate cake you cannot. The picture of the cake will still make you smile, even if U cannot sink your teeth into it.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie version of Mama Mia. Essentially a story about a young woman getting married, it becomes a delicious twist of family secrets and revelations. After she reads secret information kept by her mother, Donna, Sophie devises a plan she does not share with her mom. She invites 3 strangers to her wedding, These men are all from her mom's past, a past Donna wants to keep distant. Sophie does share this plan with her 2 best friends and her fiance, BUT only after she sends the invitations. This sets in motion a madcap string of events with short and long-term effects. The audience can now sink their teeth into some fun escapades, as Sophie attempts to keep Donna in the dark as long as possible.

The cast of this movie is a dream. Taking some of Hollywood's Elite adds to the universal appeal to basically a niche(musical)movie. Even those people who are not fans of musicals can enjoy this movie for its star quality.

Meryl Streep, in the lead role of Donna Sheridan, is fantastic. She shows the struggle of a single mom, trying to make ends meet by running a hotel in Greece, very authentically. The range of emotion the part of ""Donna"" requires, is second nature to Ms. Streep. And, while a complete shock to me, she must have known that her vocal ability was as on par as was needed. She was right. Her version of ""The Winner Takes it All"" is quite moving. Her transformation from serious, all-work-no-play, hard-nosed Donna to full of Life Donna is fun to watch.

As Sophie Sheridan, Amanda Seyfried, is both dainty and emotional. A relative newcomer(at least compared to the others in the cast) Ms. Seyfried commands the screen whenever she is the main focus. Her scene on the boat with her ""fathers"" is very moving. She also can carry quite a tune. ""Slipping through my Fingers"", the duet she shares with Ms. Streep is really fantastic.

The actors playing the 3 potential fathers are not quite up to the task in one way or another. The best of the bunch is Colin Firth, who plays Harry Bright. His voice is quite good, although he has no real solo in the film. He does however have a big secret reveal towards the end of the film that was the one big plot line difference between stage musical and movie. It's a fun scene to witness.

Stellan Skarsgard, as Bill Anderson, is very funny in some scenes, touching in others. His voice is adequate, I guess. ""Our Last Summer"" is a song he sings with the other ""fathers"".

Then there is Pierce Brosnan, as Sam Carmichael. As far as acting goes, he is really good. The scenes he shares with Ms. Streep are really well-acted. HOWEVER, his singing is terrible. I mean REALLY BAD. Certain times, I thought a cat was being harmed slightly off camera. Some people were surprised to learn that Mr. Brosnan could sing, then they found out HE CANNOT!!!!!! But he was Bond...James Bond, so cut him some slack.

Two other big names round out the main cast of ""Mama Mia"". Christine Baranski, as Tanya, a many-times divorced boozer, is one third of Donna and the Dynamos, a girl-group from years ago. Ms Baranski is always a scene-stealer in any movie she is in. During one scene in ""Mama Mia"", Ms. Baranski tries to avert the advances of a friend of the groom-to-be. She sings ""Does Your Mother Know"" as a way to both flirt and repel this ""YOUNG man"". As a veteran of Broadway and the silver screen, Ms. Baranski's acting and vocal talents are very well perfected.

As ""Rosie"", Julie Walters is the second third of the group. Younger audiences know Ms. Walters as Mrs. Weasley, from the Harry Potter movies. ""Rosie"" is a semi-famous cookbook author who seems to fall hard for Stellan Skarsgard's ""Bill"". ""Take a chance on me"" is her play at a life with Bill. Both are fantastic.

So, Mama Mia, the MOVIE, is a fantastic time. Is it the same as seeing it on Broadway? Certainly not. But for reaching a far more widespread audience, this movie is perfect!",1276473600,,4429,4.543287327478042
3614116,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I didn't read the reviews before I ordered the dvd - those critical of Pierce Brosnan's singing might have discouraged me and I would have missed the most delightful of shows. Maybe if you just watched it once you would not have picked up on the brilliant direction of this film. I've seen it probably twelve times in the month I've had it and am still catching the little subtleties that are seemingly everywhere (lady director) and have to admit I like Pierce's singing - but then I liked Eastwood and Marvin's singing in Paint Your Wagon. This is wonderfully cast, and the performances are unforgettable, but be warned the music keeps playing on that jukebox in your mind.",1276041600,,675,4.680672268907563
3614117,5,B001GKJ2DY,"You all know the cast is All-Star. The fact that they all sing their own parts with no `Ghost Singers' makes this romp based on Abba songs all the better. And by the way, Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski can sing, and I mean very very well.

The music, the scenery, the scenarios...all very excellent. And people, every actor/actress here can SING. While some think the `Dancing Queen' sequence is great, I think the Dancing Guys In Flippers (only 30 seconds long) is hilarious.

The choreography is superb. The music is great, and the whole thing is just fun.

The plot? Simple. A young girl invites three men (Firth, Brosnan, and Skarsgard) who are totally different, to her wedding. One of them, she believes, is her father. Her mother (Streep) had `encounters' with each. And each man, in return, believes himself to be the daughter he never knew of. Because of this, each man is transformed. Simple, and enough of the plot.

The movie is about the incredible music and dance sequences. Enjoy this film for that simple fact. I know I did.

And by the way, the movie is freaking funny.",1275696000,,1107,4.685567010309279

I now own the soundtrack and love blasting it.  And every couple months or so, I catch it on HBO since it always puts me in a great mood.

I blushed for Streep, Brosnan, and Firth, as they inexpertly belted tunes off-key with a melodramatic exaggeration I would expect to see from a child actor in a low budget Disney movie.  Who gave this director money?  Who edited this?  What producer didn't put their foot down when they saw the end result, and stop this movie from ever hitting the theaters?

3614139,3,B001GKJ2DY,"Mamma Mia / B001GKJ2DY

I'm generally not a fan of ""jukebox musicals"" - musicals that are based around a group of pre-existing songs, with a loosely strung-together plot to connect the dots between the songs on the soundtrack. I went into Mamma Mia not realizing that it was a jukebox musical for ABBA songs, and I left disappointed.

Not that there's anything wrong with the songs on here - they're catchy and upbeat, if you like that sort of thing - that is, if you like ABBA. If you're not here for the ABBA songs, though, the musical comes off as flimsy and anemic - with several plot points seemingly out of place, largely in order to lead into another ABBA song. Indeed, without the basic understanding that ""Mamma Mia"" is a jukebox musical, a lot of songs feel strangely out of place - ""Honey, Honey"", in particular, seems oddly sensual for a young woman to be fantasizing about her mother's lovers. The setting and timeline, too, are badly muddled - the musical takes place in Greece, but ""Mamma Mia!"" carries Italian overtones, and ""Our Last Summer"" wistfully places them in France when, to judge from all other plot points, they weren't. Mama mia, but this is very confusing to a viewer not in the know.

If you really like ABBA songs, you may enjoy this musical, but I found the soundtrack to be the strongest feature of this movie. The actual plot itself is very flimsy, and often feels like an excuse to rush to the next song. The acting and singing is superb, and the movie is well-cast, but it's hard to hang a meaningful, compelling plot on a handful of catchy dance songs.

Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sophie-Zawistowski/dp/0784011710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sophie Zawistowski</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Karen-Blixen/dp/0783240171/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Karen Blixen</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miranda-Priestly/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miranda Priestly</a>. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buona-Sera-Mrs-Campbell/dp/6302641934/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buona Sera Mrs Campbell</a>, you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.

This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark and is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.

Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant filmmaking experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic ""Dancing Queen"" number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.

In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and ""Money, Money, Money"", as well as the more emotive ballads like ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"".  She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on ""S.O.S."" (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsgrd as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry - are also likeable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, ""I Have a Dream"". The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of ""Dancing Queen"" complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of ""Waterloo"" (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook). Go at your own risk...you may love it.",1261267200,6,5296,5.937090432503276

3614160,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I'm not going to nit-pick like a critic and just express my own opinion of this movie - I loved it! I grew up on ABBA's music as my parents were fans and remember singing and dancing to ""Dancing Queen"" when I was seven (such memories!). I have loved ABBA ever since, and it was only recently that I actually got to watch the movie (sadly, on DVD, as I missed it during its theater run). Though the actors do not remotely resemble (nor sing like) the singers of ABBA, they more than make up for it with genuine chemistry and camaraderie. A viewer can tell these actors had great fun during the production of this musical/movie and their fun is incredibly infectious! I sang out loud and even danced to the old, familiar, classic songs, and had so much fun! The main cast is made up of famous actors - the incomparable Meryl Streep (who really showcases her beautiful singing voice here), the svelte Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters (I remember her most from her role as Mrs Weasley in the Harry Potter movie franchise), Pierce Brosnan (yes, he does not exactly have a great singing voice, but who cares???), Colin Firth (whose performance as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice left an indelible impression on me), Stellan Skarsgaard, and the two young and talented actors, Amanda Seyfried as Sophie, and Dominic Cooper as her fiance, Sky (the pair are a real-life couple and reportedly began dating on the set of the movie).

The story begins with 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan who discovers that any one of three men (Brosnan, Firth, or Skarsgaard) could be her father. Wishing to have her father (Sophie was raised by her mother,Donna played by Meryl Streep) walk her down the aisle at her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper), Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. The clueless Donna invites her two former backup singers to the wedding (Baranski and Walters), and when she sees the three men from her past, all hell breaks loose, and so does the music! The plot is quite thin, and the characters are not explored in-depth here - but the focal point of the movie is the music. The plot revolves around the music, and the lively dance numbers showcase great choreography. The fashion is reminiscent of ABBA's heyday and the costumes are in a riot of colors - all in all, pure rip-roaring fun!

This is a fun movie that brings back nostalgic memories. I will be adding this to my DVD collection. Someday, I hope to watch the Broadway musical.",1260489600,2,2445,4.631336405529954

3614172,3,B001GKJ2DY,"This poorly made, highly obnoxious and often annoying musical is so over-the-top with deliciously tacky charm that it almost demands you enjoy it.  The scary thing is that, for the most part, I did.  I remember turning to my wife after the film had ended and muttering the words ""that was awkward"" and maybe that is part of the charm.  No one seems entirely comfortable with their role in this film, and that layer of discomfort kind of adds a tinge of adorableness to the film and its vast array of characters.

That doesn't mean that this is a good movie, just a fun one.

The story is of young Sophie who lives on this crazy island with her single mother who runs a hotel on the verge of a breakdown.  When Sophie decides to get married she wants to have her father walk her down the isle (what young girl doesn't).  There is just one problem; she doesn't know who he is.  After reading her mother's diary she discovers that there are three possibilities; Sam, Bill or Harry.  She decides to invite all of them to her wedding in order to discover who her father really is, but when they arrive she realizes that finding him is going to be harder than she thought.

The film is ridiculous and just a hodgepodge of overzealous musical numbers that are so focused on zany choreography that they forget the most important aspect of a musical number is the singing.

Despite this, I cannot say I was not entertained.

The best acting award goes to Streep (is that really a surprise).  She is so over-the-top yet thoroughly committed so that even when she's all over the place it is in a good way.  She is clearly having a blast filming this and it shows all over her face.  Surprisingly, young Amanda Seyfried actually holds her own and delivers a nicely tuned performance.  It doesn't hurt that out of the entire cast they are the only two who can sing (Streep has a few pitch problems but she actually soars on her final number).  Christine Baranski is funny, as is Walters.  Colin Firth is, well, Colin Firth (you gotta love this guy) and Stellan Skarsgard (who I've been a fan of for some time) delivers one of the more sympathetic `fatherly' performances.

Pierce Brosnan is a revelation here, and not in a good way.  His voice is GOD-AWFUL (he sounds like a dying walrus, or a drowning man with Down syndrome; take your pick).  I'm really surprised they allowed him to sing his own songs (I'm really surprised they didn't recast the whole film to be honest beings that the two female leads are the only ones who somewhat make it through this film with dignity).

His Razzie was certainly owed him.

Don't expect a good film (I hope you aren't), but do expect to have a good time.  I can see why this is so loved, for it is lovable.  It is very poorly made (even the dancing numbers seem choppy and sloppy), but Streep does wonders for the film to be honest.  Her ability to just throw caution to the wind and embrace the campy mess that she has been dealt simply draws in the audience and lets them know that it's okay to turn off your brain and have a good time.

Even Meryl Streep knows that this movie is horrible.",1257811200,3,3121,4.420315236427321

3614174,1,B001GKJ2DY,"First, I have a fond spot in my heart for Abba and their music. What a great script, a great score, fun actors all around... but Meryl Streep ruins this film for me.  Her performance is wayyyy over the top.  She's trying to play 15 years younger and it just doesn't work.  Absolutely horrible performance.  She should have won the Razzy for worst performance of the year!  The ABC show Modern Family had a wonderful joke about her performance in a recent episode, basically, the gay character loved her and the straight one didn't. I feel that this joke epitomizes my feeling about her in this role.  If you love all musicals, then you'll probably like this one.  If you actually care about acting and craft you'll probably agree with me that Streep's performance is unwatchable.

5 Stars to script, songs, supporting cast, location.
Negative 4 Stars to Meryl Streep for a completely unwatchable performance. Equals one star.

3614179,2,B001GKJ2DY,"When I don't like a movie or book very much, and many others do, I try to think of why.  In this case I concluded that this movie was made for middle aged women who are trying to remember their youth, who remember it as more glorious than it was.  Amd whenever any such work is so narrowly aimed, it is bound to be sub-standard.

I realize that this was a successful play with music by a popular source.  Maybe the play was okay--but not for me.  The plot of the movie, however, is lame, lame, lame--one for all the prospective fathers of the bride.  The casting was grossly inappropriate with few exceptions.  I just saw the movie and can't remember a single song.  The scenery was nice enough, but most varied, according to IMDB.  It was shot at a couple of places in Greece--and partly in a London studio--and on California beaches, probably because there sere no nice beaches on that Greek isle.  So the producers couldn't even be honest or coherent with the background.  If you want to visit that Greek island after this, you'll need to include the Pacific Ocean, etc.

Now, the movie felt interminable.  It was very poorly edited, with meaningless scenes and dialogue.  People were jumping all over the place, or falling off roofs, or dangling from this or that--all in an attempt, perhaps, to lend life to something that was DOA for me.  ""Hair"" it is not.  As an update for the hippie participants, it's a wash.  I liked ""Hair"" but not ""Mamma Mia,"" which, by the way, is Italian, not Greek.",1256428800,3,1497,4.5055762081784385

ABBA created a lot of awful music, just remember that.  Only at the very end when Meryl Streep sings atop a seaside cliff that the movie gets redeemed.  That scene was gorgeous and looked imamculate in Bluray and for top-end TVs.

3614193,1,B001GKJ2DY,"My mother in law LOVES this movie so I was coerced into watching it last night.  It was TERRIBLE!  First I don't like watching grown women running around and squealing like 12 year olds at a pajama party.  I mean how old are these people?  The whole cast acted like 12 year olds.  High School Musical was more mature!  But the defining moment came when Remington Steele (Brosnan) and Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) became complete and total buffoons.  I grew up with Remington Steele and Brosnan will always be Remington Steele to me, comical yet sophisicated and elegant.  Colin Firth in A&E's production of Pride & Prejudice was brilliant as Mr. Darcy.  I expected more mature and serious roles of Brosnan and Firth.  I mean did they intentionally want to play buffoons because they certainly did a good job at it.  I suffered in silence until Brosnan started singing 'I Do, I Do, etc.' and then I lost it.  How ridiculous!  Yeah right.  He's loved her for 21 years.  Sure. Until then I just found the movie immature and childish; that performance made it a complete and total joke.  The only saving aspect of this movie was the music, and that was pretty much ruined by the terrible performance of Brosnan.  The other singers were tolerable but very lacking compared to the broadway musical and ABBA itself.  This wasn't a 'feel good' movie; it was an embarassment and painful to watch.",1252540800,12,1382,4.66390041493776

3614196,3,B001GKJ2DY,"In order to enjoy this movie, you should be a fan or at least like ABBA's songs because the whole Mamma Mia's idea is just an excuse for letting the grateful viewers/listeners experience their favorite songs in a relaxing and feeling good setting on a colorful sunny idyllic Greek isle surrounded by the bluest sea you can imagine. I consider myself a loyal ABBA's fan. I still remember how I heard their songs for the first time almost thirty years ago, how happy I was to be able to own their albums on LPs, how much I enjoyed ABBA: The Movie (1977) which came to Moscow in the beginning of the 1980s and was basically the record of their concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. I also saw the famous musical Mamma Mia on which the last year movie is based on and I liked it a lot. It would not hurt if you can take with humor outrageous psychedelic outfits of the 1970s and the tight boots with the platforms so huge that it makes your feet hurt just to look at them. If that sounds like your idea of fun, fun you'll have. I sure did, at least for the first hour or to be precise until the very moment, Pierce Brosnan had ruined my favorite ABBA's song S.O.S by attempting to sing it. I guess it is sometimes easier to save the world from all sorts of evil than just to sing a song. While that torture lasted, I kept repeating instead of S.O.S, S.O.E which means Save Our Ears. I later found out that when asked during an interview why he took the role, Brosnan replied that when he heard from his agent, ""Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep"", he took it without asking whom he'd play. Well, acting next to Streep is a great reason, and I believe Brosnan had a lot of fun sharing the screen with her. I also believe that there is nothing impossible for Meryl. She can play anything and anybody. Just to think what she has done in all the movies she has graced with her presence. She did very convincing accents, she learned how to play a violin, she dances, she has been a villain and a saint, and everybody in between and she's been always the reason to watch any movie. While watching Mamma Mia, I got the crazy idea. What if Meryl played all six older characters, Donna, her two girlfriends and three men from her past? I know it sounds weird but if Eddie Murphy could do it, I am sure Meryl Streep could act and sing for six characters and she would be simply fabulous. Between Streep and young talented Amanda Seyfried, two of them made a nice singing/acting team. But even with Meryl playing and singing only one part, the film is still entertaining and fun mostly due to the fact that everyone involved had a good time on the charming little island, the serious actors were not afraid to make fools out of themselves for all of us to enjoy, and in the end everyone was happy and got what they wanted even if it was not exactly what they wanted in the beginning of the movie.",1251676800,5,2883,4.311233885819521
3614197,3,B001GKJ2DY,"The Blu Ray version is one of the best transfers I've seen on this platform.  The colors are saturated and sparkling.  The film version of the hit musical offers stunning production values and memorable ABBA tunes with updated arrangements.  What's not to like?  While traditional Hollywood musicals often featured singers of less than stellar talents (e.g. Fred Astaire) these stars were usually paired with someone who was an A-list singer.  A frothy, fun musical doesn't require extraordinary acting skill, so having Meryl Streep in the lead role is a bit odd.  If the producers felt the picture needed someone of that stature, it would have made more sense to go with someone who was also an accomplished singer, such as Glenn Close.  The time-honored alternative is to dub the singing parts with a ghost singer, which is what should have been done for Mr. Brosnan's part.  The off-key, lackluster singing really drags down this otherwise beautiful film as many of the musical sequences are quite long. It reminds me of Ross Hunter's forgotten musical production of ""Lost Horizon"" which as doomed by its cast of casual singers. You might want to rent this film before you buy to determine if you'd really want to view it many times.",1251590400,,1236,4.908653846153846
3614198,4,B001GKJ2DY,"Is Meryl Streep perfect in Mamma Mia?  Just about, though everything else carries with it the least little hint of could have been better.  When they announced the movie and said that Olivia Newton John might be playing Donna, we all cheered, and then when it seemed like Michelle Pfeiffer was getting the nod, we were even happier.  Frankly, Meryl Streep gets everything nowadays, can't they give it to someone whose career could use the boost?  But she can sing and of course she can act up a storm.  Donna never seems to think twice about what she is going to the Greek coastline with her enormous tourist hotel and employing all the Greek islanders as her gofers.  How does she pay any of them I wonder, if the business is as bad as she claims?

How did Amanda Seyfried get to meet those two bridesmaids who seem to have wandered in from a movie like BLOW-UP--tall, leggy, older supermodels indistinguishable from each other, not a single personality between them.  They just make Sophie look like a midget, can she really be that short?  I used to like Seyfried, but her goofy swoons every time her mother sings are too forced.  I like exuberance, but hers is cooked up like heroin sizzling in a spoon.  And yet, she's not awful, and in fact she does a pretty good job convincing us that she really wants to find out who her father is.  This must speak to a lot of people who don't know their fathers, I guess, but for the rest of us, it is not motivation enough--it is the opposite of motivation--countermotivation perhaps.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic what's his name have chemistry during their big number Lay All Your Love on Me, possibly ABBA's sexiest tune, but otherwise I'm looking at him wondering what the big deal is.  A star of tomorrow, I don't think so.

What a missed opportunity for Meryl Streep to have introduced Abba's ""JUST LIKE THAT"" to the world.  ABBA fans know that ""MAMMA MIA"" the stage musical actually had a ""Just Like That"" scene which was trimmed during out of town tryouts.  Here she does a fine job with ""The Winner Takes It All,"" but no one can actually perform that one better than the original by Agnetha Faltskog... maybe Meryl Streep is too levelheaded a person really to put that song over.  Is she ever really down, or does she find a little bit of hope even in her darkest hour?  With Agnetha we knew that everything in the universe was and is and remains doomed, for the gods, cold as ice, throw a dice and decide our fate.",1251590400,3,2468,4.493273542600897

Pierce Brosnan was a joke as a singer.  Perhaps with some genuine musical theater stars in the role, it may have worked.  Even so, I got so tired of its teeny-bopper mentality, even from the adults, that I soon came to understand why the late-night comedians made such fun of this film.  Is it a feel-good film?  Yes (my 81-year-old mother-in-law liked it), but much of the ""feel-good"" comes from laughing AT it.  The blu-ray transfer was excellent, which befits the great ocean-front scenery, the movie's greatest asset.

3614207,5,B001GKJ2DY,"My wife made me go to see this, because all the PMT ridden harpies in her office were raving about the film. I tried to refuse but she overpowered me with her mind-games.

I wanted to go to the cinema, sit in the dark and sulk.

But they wouldn't let me.

Maybe it was the warmth of the Greek sun mixed with the melodies of ABBA but after only a few minutes I couldn't help but feel happier. Damn them.

By the middle of the film I was laughing as loudly as everyone else, and finally I jumped up onto my feet during the finale to spin my beloved up the aisle.

As I left the cinema, feeling giddy and warm (my wife and I talked about nonsense all the way home on the train - just laughing and joking over silly things) - I realised that the film had transformed the both of us for the night. We did not talk about the film, but the joy and freedom and sense of fun it gave us remained.

The next day I read many of the critical reviews, nearly all panned the film, and although I can objectivly see that the film was not the most technically accomplished, I have two reasons why I think my wife and I loved the experience so much.

1. I cannot remember seeing a film featuring people my own age actually having fun. Not 'acting' like they are having fun but actually have a romp. Hollywood take note - we live in an ageing population and people of my age like seeing the vitality that can be afforded to us rather than being reminded that we are just too old to face transforming robots. (ps - 41 is not old)

2. The music of ABBA has tremendous power, even after all these years. I have always enjoyed their melodies, the complex arrangements give their sound a surprising depth. Integrated into the film, flimsy as the plot is, just produces a renewed vigour to it - like meeting an old friend that you have not seen for years.

Forget the critics, like aimless children in a playground they follow whatever the zeitgeist dictates, trying to convince us of what is note worthy and important. They offer analytical pieces that nail all of the technical faults of this film but have managed to miss all of it's emotional triumphs. Just see this film - you may hate it - but there are too many of us saying that this film 'just' made us feel happy. In times like these that is a valuable ability and gift not to be missed.",1250467200,5,2322,4.211711711711712

They are preparing for Sophie's wedding and Sophie feels the need to know who her real father is, and wants him with her during this special time.  She had read her mother's diary and there were three possibilities on who her father is.  She invites each to attend her wedding without her mother's knowledge.

Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) all arrive on the same boat.

Donna finds out they are at her resort and is absolutely shocked to meet her old lovers again after 20 years have patched.  Her two best friends, Tanya (Christine Baranaki) and Rosie (Julia Walters), for their advice and help on how to get through the next few days.  Sophie finds time to be with the three men and looks for clues on who her real dad is.  Again, the unexpected surprise is Streep, Brosman and even Christine Baranski - singing and having fun with this romantic romp.  No matter how schmaltzy Abba can be it is just a ""sparkly""  time for all.",1250380800,2,1626,4.602787456445993
3614209,5,B001GKJ2DY,"First, this is a review of the movie, not the DVD as I saw Mamma Mia! in the theater.

I only went to see the beautiful Greek scenery, having no interest in seeing a musical, nor in Abba songs, nor in Mamma Mia! the musical from stage.  I expected to be a bit bored, and boy was I happily mistaken!

This movie is a whole lot of fun.  The actors are great.  There is madcap sort of storyline about a woman who raises her daughter alone on a Greek island and the men who may be that girl's father.  It's great fun, over the top, madcap, even silly humor.  The songs fit right in and just add to the fun spirit of the movie.  What a great summer movie this is.

I don't recall every plot twist and turn, but do recall feeling very happy and entertained.  It's a very upbeat movie.

And of course, the scenery is beautiful.",1250294400,,820,4.09433962264151
3614210,4,B001GKJ2DY,"I must admit, I had seen all the bad reviews, and had drawn back from watching this movie. I now know that THAT was a mistake! It may be a guilty pleasure, but I found this charming, with a wonderful sense of the use of the songs of ABBA that I've loved for years. Yes, it is a little over the top -- but when was the last time you watched ""An American in Paris?"" I re-watched it lately, and talk about over the top! But IT WORKS and is considered a classic. That's because the MUSIC works. The same could be said for ""Mama Mia"". Maybe not on the same level -- ABBA is not on par with Gershwin, after all -- but they never pretended to be, either.

I knew Meryl Streep could sing (she does it very well in ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Postcards from the Edge""), but Colin Firth surprised me pleasantly. And could anything be funnier (or campier) than Christine Baranski's ""Does Your Mother Know?"" And I certainly cannot remember a more unique (or funnier) dance sequence than is in ""Lay All Your Love On Me!""

I'm well over 50, so I remember those clothes, those awful platform shoes, and how the music critics savaged ABBA as being ""cotton candy"" music. So ignore the critics. This movie will bring back some happy memories (if you are as old as I am!), and make some new ones!",1250121600,3,1281,4.289256198347108

After seeing the movie I didn't like it either,I LOVED IT.
First of all,Meryl Streep can do ANYTHING.If she's in a movie,you know it has to be great. She can sing and dance like there's no tommow.
Its wonderfull seeing actors over 50 singing and dancing,and having fun for once in a movie. Most films have actors over 50 in the background,this one has them featured.
 Amanda Seyfried  has the best singing voice,and she's wonderfull in the film,but Pierce Brosnan takes alittle getting use to,but he gives it his best.
""Mamma Mia""is a Musical Classic  I look forward to watching again.",1250121600,,747,4.687022900763359
3614212,2,B001GKJ2DY,Pierce Brosnan really does suck in this and I think was completely miscast.  But it is fun and silly and a harmless way to spend time if you don't mind ABBA music being sung badly.  The stage musical was better.,1249516800,2,211,4.25
3614213,3,B001GKJ2DY,"""Mamma Mia"" boasts an all-star cast and fantastic music by ABBA, but it doesn't rank as one of my favorite movie musicals of all time. The story revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a 20-year-old girl about to tie the knot on the beautiful island she resides on with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie has no idea who who father is (neither does Donna, for that matter), so she invites the three possible candidates (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding in hopes of reuniting with her true paterfamilias. Needless to say, Donna isn't exactly thrilled when three of her former lovers show up unexpectedly on the eve of her daughter's wedding, and of course hilarious hijinks ensue, followed by a totally unrealistic yet ridiculously happy ending.

The best part of this film is watching some of my favorite Hollywood actors sing and dance like crazy. Some of them (Streep, Seyfried, Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters) are quite impressive, while others (pretty much all of the guys) are not. Also, I have no idea where this movie was filmed, but it's absolutely gorgeous and I totally want to go there!

This movie made me smile...laugh...belly laugh until I was crying. I rarely buy a movie, but this one I had to have it.

I could identify with so many of the themes in the movie, espcially when your daughter leaves the house to get married. The acting was great and the scenery fantastic.  I'm a huge Meryl Streep fan so I watch anything she is in and I love the fact that she pushed herself to do something out of her comfort zone and take on a singing role. Her courage in her roles is one of the things I like so much about her.

First of all:

1.  You have to be familiar with ABBA music.
2.  You have to love ABBA music.
3.  You have to appreciate the genius of creating a story and incorporating ABBA words and music into the story line.

If you don't have the above 3 you still can enjoy Mamma Mia if you have an open mind and enjoy musicals.

How could anyone, except those with a cold heart, no sucumb to The Winner Takes It All or Slipping Through My Fingers.  Who could not smile with joy hearing and seeing Mamma Mia or Does Your Mother Know or Take a Chance On Me.

I saw the Broadway show and enjoyed it immensely.  I own the movie.  I have seen it twice in the movie theater and at least six times at home.  The only thing that makes the Broadway show better that it has more songs that are sung to completion.

This is a movie you should just sit back and enjoy.  It is a feel good fun movie.  Don't try to pick it apart.  Just enjoy it. It will be a long time before you can get the words and music out of your head.",1249171200,,1138,3.9646017699115044

The story is thin... and delightful. The ""acting"" is almost entirely over the top in every scene, but sufficiently shy of ""eye rolling - OMG"" melodramatic to hold your attention and your cookies. I felt actual physical pain and empathy for Pierce Brosnan every time that brave man ""sang""... and couldn't help but cheer him on through every note for his raw courage. This movie is ""scripted play,"" and I'd KILL to have been on that set! Meryl Streep, as always, is awesome and adorable and endearing in this part... and she's got a wonderful warm voice I sincerely enjoyed listening to... and wonder why she's not done more singing parts.

An utterly charming movie that I cannot watch three minute's worth without feeling that endorphin flow you usually only get with your very best mates at your looniest.

3614222,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I honestly didn't know if I'd care for Mamma Mia! I'd read the muscial reviews and was familiar with the songs. I'd gotten a kick out of reading of people dancing in the aisles during the film and thought the whole thing of stringing Abba's greatest hits together was a little cheesy. I decided to watch the movie for lack of something better to do. I'm quite ill and have been bedridden since Nov. 2008.

 Much to my surprise, I found the movie a joy to watch, not to mention Meryl Streep. The songs seemed to fit together seemlessly as though they were specifically written for the film, and everybody looked like they were having a wonderful time. What I liked about Mamma Mia the most is that it made me feel good. That says quite a lot, considering  most of the time I am in severe pain and nobody knows exactly why and what to do about it, as well as all the other uncertain things that are occurring in our lives.

The colors are brilliant, the water just gorgeous. I don't usually watch a movie more than once in a while, except for a few like Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice and definitely prefer the serious dramas, but I am delighted that I decided to take a chance on Mamma Mia. :) (I've tried to watch for typos, but my vision is very poor, so forgive me)",1248307200,2,1265,4.324894514767933

3614239,4,B001GKJ2DY,"Admit it -- somewhere in the darkest and most guarded place in your hearts, you like ABBA. Maybe just a little bit, but you do. The Swedish group's music was a perfect complement to the 1970s disco era -- mindless, pleasure-oriented, saccharine and highly melodic. ""Mamma Mia"" stitches together ABBA's greatest hit (and a few more) into a fun and sometimes funny musical experience. The plot is silly and contrived -- a hippy girl's daughter is getting married and wants to invite her Dad to the nuptials. The singing -- done by the principals themselves, including Meryl Streep -- is mostly good, with the exception of poor Pierce Brosnan's forced efforts at song. The ABBA tunes more or less, kind of, almost fit the action. But the star of the movie, as far as I was concerned, was the terrific movement and lighting -- dancing, running, leaping glory bathed in Mediterranean light and Greek aesthetic. Cute story, fine music, but a delight for the eyes.",1247788800,3,957,4.806060606060606

I want an escape, I want entertainment and I want to relax.  This movie fits every bill.  And as for the pans on Pierce Brosnan's voice, I think it fits his character.  He isn't a smooth and polished vocalist, true, but he sounds like most people do.  Honestly he sounded better than I expected.  Meryl Streep just blew me away with her voice and her athletic performance. Sophie was marvelous!

I rarely see a movie more than once but I saw this one five times in the theater and bought the special edition the day it came out.  I also have given several copies as gifts.  My daughters were delighted! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!",1247788800,,798,4.295302013422819

Simple, but totally entertaining.  I think it deserves additional praise, because the music was not really created for this production.  Rather, they were carefully and expertly arranged and placed to a much later production.  The performances are great, and obviously the actors are having a good time with the film.  The second dvd included is actually very interesting and well done, and it explains to the viewer how upbeat everything involving Mamma Mia seems to be.

The plot is simple: Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to get married, but she has no father to walk her down the aisle. Well, to be more accurate, she has three possible fathers, and she's determined to find out which is the right one. Throw in dreamy Greek islands and a toe-tapping selection of ABBA songs, and you have a recipe for contagious smiles. Meryl Streep plays Sophie's mother Donna, a spirited, independent woman whose carefree youth has been replaced by the hardships of single motherhood and the challenges of running her own business. Streep really shows off her talent both as an actress and a singer, pulling off her role with natural ease. Seyfried also dazzles, doing proud by her hometown of Allentown, PA (I just had to mention that, because I'm also from the Lehigh Valley). Pierce Brosnan's singing did elicit groans of physical pain from the audience, however. MAMA MIA! is not an emotionally or philosophically deep movie, but it does have its poignant moments. The two scenes that pack real emotional power are Streep's performance of ""The Winner Takes All"" and the touching ""Slipping through My Fingers.""

Meryl Streep is amazing and very physical in this recreation of the Broadway hit.  Pierce Brosnan surprises with a capable singing voice.  Though I thought the ending a bit contrived, the Greek scenery was breath-taking.  Widescreen is the only way to go to capture all the beauty.  Christine Baranski was, as usual, fantastically funny.

One of the most unbelievable technical achievements is the fact that most of the Greek village is actually a set, inside and out.

I know some people just love this movie, but I am not one of them.  I enjoyed it, but more so for the music. ABBA is great, and I know some people won't agree with that, but that's the point: to each their own.  The location was beautiful, as were the costumes.

The story, if you have not heard it yet (or scene 30 Rock this season) is: A girl is about to get married, and wants to know who her father is before she does, the problem is she does not know who her dad is.  So she invites the 3 men her mother wrote about in her diary about the time she was conceived.  To her shock, all 3 rsvp to her wedding, and the slap stick, confusing comedy/melodrama ensues.  Fortunately for her, any one of the guys would make a great dad, and they are all willing to play the part.  More slap stick comedy/melodrama ensues until happy twist, and happy ending.

This is definitely a musical. The storyline and dialog are used to glue the songs together. The film is cute entertaining and has a balanced ending where everyone gets what he or she wants, even if he or she does not know what he or she wants. That is what we want.

3614277,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I thought this movie was a blast.  I remember hearing the Abba songs years ago, and as the songs appeared they would bring back fun memories.  But what I really liked was that the songs were incorporated in a true musical style, to advance the story line and give insight into the characters.  The actors all delivered their songs with such heart and energy, not in a corny ""Disney High School Musical"" fashion, but in a joyful burst of emotion, as if singing were as natural as talking to them.

Meryl Streep's voice was a true joy.  She gave me shivers with her delivery and style, especially ""The Winner Takes it All"".  The other singers were also top notch, except for Pierce Brosnan.  And while his voice may leave a bit to be desired, he made up for it with spirit and heart!  And everyone looked like they were having a great time with it, no plastic Barbie smiles or cheesy performances.

And not only was it fun for me with my Abba reminescences, but my teenage daughters loved it as well.  We have enjoyed sharing it over and over.  Hurray for a new musical that I could enjoy with my girls, unlike many of the other musicals of recent years, ie Sweeney Todd, Rent, Chicago, Moulin Rouge. Hey Hollywood, bring on more like this one.

(For parents, the PG was for the basic premise of the story, that Donna did not know which of the three men was the father of her daughter.  Also there was some other content, including a brief glimpse of a bare male bottom, some homosexual dance partnering, and social drinking.  There was one drug reference, with the singer miming smoking a joint and looking cross-eyed while the singing ""the night is young and the music high.""  All very small and totally unnecessary for the plot, they were probably just stuck in to insure the PG rating.)",1242691200,2,1788,4.509316770186335

Though it was also the name of a canned fish company, Abba made it their own, and became an international sensation with a catalogue of hits built on catchy hooks and a wall-of-sound made of up of multi-tracked harmonies from Agnetha and Anni-Frid.

Two fans wanted to base a musical on Abba songs--stringing the tunes together with a little plot to give it a very slight pretext. The band was at first cold to the idea, but the fan/musical producers prevailed, and after many, many performances, and now a movie, Abba has come around.

Sophie: [reading Donna's diary] We danced on the beach, kissed on the beach and dot, dot, dot.
=================================

Mamma Mia! was wildly successful, but lots of critics took aim, some calling it the worst movie of the year. I think that Mamma Mia! appealed to an untapped older audience nostalgic for the days when Dancing Queen ruled the airwaves and the dance hall. I think it was more like a Fantasy Camp for actors who always secretly wanted to be rock stars, and also wanted a chance to get away to a luscious Greek Island. It is like singing Abba at a Karaoke bar--and what is the point of judging it on the basis of the singing? It is the fun factor that is paramount. The people were having so much fun making the movie that you can't help but be caught up in the festive mood. What does Meryl Streep have to prove as an actress? Did you want to see if she could master yet another accent, and emote flawlessly, as if it were her native tongue? Don't you think she could do that blindfolded in her sleep with one hand tied behind her back?

----------------
Donna: And welcome to- to Sophie's dad. I have to tell you, he is here.
Sophie: I know, I invited him.
Donna: You couldn't have, I don't even know which one it is.
=====================================

Meryl Streep's acting was bad, but it was fun to watch her let her hair down and just have fun. How often do you get to see Streep, master thespian that she is, act badly? Pierce Brosnan signed up on the strength of her name alone, without even reading the script. Was he disappointed that she didn't bring her ""A"" Game? No, he was relieved that his acting wouldn't have to be judged in comparison. It was bad enough that of the whole cast, he was judged the weakest singer.

Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgrd were the three men from Donna Sheridan's past who might be Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried's) dad. Skarsgrd was the token Swede, and I am only mentioning him at all since I wanted to make use of my Umlaut font set, but I was glad to have him there, as after all, Abba was a Swedish group. The three possible fathers were more than adequate to their roles.

----------------
Donna: Wh-wh what are you all doing here?
Bill: I'm writing a travel piece.
Harry Bright: I- I'm on a spontaneous holiday.
Sam Carmichael: I-I-I I just dropped in to say... hi.
===============================

The three woman, led by Streep, were really great. Here is some interesting background trivia. The women who wrote Mamma Mia based the character of Tanya on Mary Ann, a character played by Christine Baranski on Cybill Shepherd's eponymously titled sit com. No wonder Christine Baranski was perfectly cast as Tanya, and the catharsis is complete.

---------------------------
Tanya: [talking about Donna's money troubles and her life in general] Yeah, but are you being taken care of?
Donna: What do you mean?
Tanya: Are you getting any?
Donna: Oh, you mean...
[turns on the screw driver, making loud noises, then says to the screw driver:]
Donna: Down, boy.
===================================

Julie Walters as Rosie was also a little show stealer.

------------------------
Rosie: [to Tanya] Typical isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad and then three come along at once.
============================================

So, if you want to pass judgment on a movie and fault it for bad singing, bad acting, and over or under exposed film, then by all means throw those rotten tomatoes. But if you want to have fun, fun, fun 'til your daddy takes your T-Bird away, then what are you waiting for? Mamma Mia!

And I like musicals. I was open to the ABBA music. But the directing and cinematography looked like an afterthought to a home-made video of some vacation in Greece. I actually looked away from the screen several times because I was so embarrassed for the participants in this film. The acting was horrendous; similar quality might not bother you if you paid $2 admission to a small town high school stage production, but this is supposed to be a professional film. Even Streep's performance was embarrassing, though she at least surprised me as a much more competent singer than her peers. Some of the actors' singing was jaw-droppingly bad.

Discovering it on DVD, I immediately thought that the critics were a little hard on the movie when it premiered in theaters.  It's not that they were wrong about some of its shortcomings: Pierce Brosnan's singing is indeed not very good; there's a noticeable overreliance on obvious studio recreations of outdoor sets when they could have just used the actual outdoor sets; and or two other nitpicks.  But any flaws are just that, nitpicks, not fatal elements that should drive a viewer away.  I will say that the movie didn't catch fire up to its full potential, based on all the footage of screaming, joyous fans seeing the stage version that is peppered throughout the special features and promo spots on the DVD, but things are energetic enough.  And several of the secondary characters- especially Meryl Streep's two girlfriends- were a little cartoony for my tastes.  But again, nitpicks.  Just enjoy the scenery, music, and romance.

Here's a quiz:
1) Are you a fan of ABBA?
2) Do you like movie musicals?
3) Do you like romantic comedies?
4) Do you like Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, and/or some combination thereof?

Here are the results:
1) If you can't stand the music of ABBA, move on...skip this movie, do not buy, (also do not pass ""GO"" do not collect $200).
2) If you answered YES to question #1 and at least one of the other questions, add this DVD to your collection.  You will watch it occasionaly, and enjoy it thoroughly each time.
3) If you answered YES to at least two of the other questions, you MUST get this DVD.  You will love it, and you will most likely watch it repeatedly.

I found this movie to be great fun!  ABBA was at their apex of popularity when I was in college, and hearing this music brought back fun memories.  I thought that the director, writers, choreographers, and sound engineers did a grand job of synchronizing the music, dance, and storyline.

The setting for the film is exotic.  The storyline is interesting, and the acting is engaging and fun.  The singing is good for the most part, though my HS aged drama-choir kids seem to gain a sort of pleasure from mocking Pierce Brosnan's solos.  Granted, his solos are probably the weakest link in the show.  On the other hand, I loved it when Meryl Streep's character and her two best friends sang at her daughter's bachelorette party.

The story is almost melodramatic, and the main characters pull off their roles well.  The music and dancing is fun, and if you enjoy that sort of thing, then you will definitely enjoy this show

  Everything works, even the parts that don't.

  It's a silly plot line (a young girl on the eve of her wedding trying to find who of three men is her father), the singing is often - to be polite - strained, some of the veteran thespians couldn't dance too well - but who cares?

3614313,2,B001GKJ2DY,"""Mamma Mia"", I think needed a more seasoned film director. Many of the jokes fell flat, and it felt sluggish. The play was meant to be light and feel-good. The director, Phyllida Lloyd, I have read is an acclaimed theatre director, but the ""tricks of the trade"" known only by those who have a passion for film making, could have made this work.

It is not that I can't enjoy a film about weddings and Abba's music, I found the use of Abba's music absolutely magical in the darker comedy ""Muriel's Wedding"".

Some have said just the island scenes in this were wonderful. I didn't think so. The island scenes in this film felt like nothing more than a pretty backdrop. The film could have been shot in Blue Screen. You never really feel the islands effect on the characters, It could have been shot indoors. Paul Mazursky's The Tempest, set on the Greek Isles, might not have been a great film but is a good example of characters in relationship to their environment. Films last year like ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" and ""Bruges"" really knew the importance of location. The characters in those two films where facing comic dilemmas like the characters in Mama Mia, But I felt the the magic of the environment much more in those two films.

The story just needed to be told by a better story teller.

In fact, that's why I stopped watching this movie in the first half hour; I was afraid if I continued, I would end up deleting all of the ABBA songs from my iPod, and smashing all of my ABBA CDs.

The funny thing is I was watching this DVD as a break from three other DVDs I have been watching for two weeks--the mini-series ""Holocaust"", which was one of Meryl Streep's first works. I thought it would be nice to see her in a happy movie in a happy place in a happy time.

3614315,2,B001GKJ2DY,"This movie, like ""Across the Universe"", seeks to create a plot which overlays the hit songs of a musical group.  Mamma Mia is set on a Greek island, where a young girl is about to get married and wants to have her father present for the wedding.  Unfortunately, she has been able to narrow the paternalistic possibilities down to three men and no further.  Her mother, who raised her in a hotel she owns on the island, has revealed nothing to her about her parentage.  The daughter secretly writes to the three candidates whose names she discovers in her mother's diary.

Fine so far.  If only the characters had not been so vapid...the singing so excrutiatingly awful.  I've enjoyed Pierce Brosnan in plenty of other movies, but I'm afraid his singing will force you out of the room.

As for Meryl Streep's two old pals who show up for the event, they reminded me of aging characters from ""Grease"" who never grew up.  The child bride is a giddy airhead who certainly is not capable of carrying the movie as a main character.

Streep and Brosnan do their best and might have done ok if not for the musical demands.  Colin Firth's talents are frankly wasted.

The only redeeming value of this movie is the cast.  They were certainly having fun while making this film.  Christine Baranski, Julie Walters and Meryl Streep were wonderful.  The movie suffers in direction and, sadly, the music itself.  The film plays out like it should be on stage, when some of the performance should've been tailored to fit a movie.  The sets were cheesy and fake-looking.  And the music...it's an affront to ABBA.  All the fun of ABBA's music has been sucked out of these performances.  While everyone's acting was good, the singing voices of Julie Walters and Pierce Brosnan were terrible.  ""Dancing Queen"" sounds like bad, off-key karaoke.  ""The Winner Takes It All"" almost made my ears bleed and was the one moment where Streep sounded bad.

All in all, this movie was a waste of time.  And I love musicals...from Meet Me In St. Louis and Sound of Music, through Rocky Horror Picture Show, down to Chicago and Moulin Rouge.

I realize this film is the most successful film musical of all time, and I can appreciate that lots of people loved it.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.",1237939200,5,1297,4.569565217391304

Merryl Streep can sing !!! She is the most beautiful actress, one who can sing too ! Pierce Brosnan on the other hand did pretty well himself with his part in the songs (we all know he could act well).

Now for the blue-ray version of the disk.. It has some awesome features... Sing along is the best. This pack also comes with a digital media disk which you can use to transfer movies / songs on some digital media player like iPod..

3614331,1,B001GKJ2DY,"The Good: the water was pretty.
The Bad: the storyline, the songs, the singing, the acting
The Ugly: the directing and editing.

Don't get me wrong--I love musicals, I'm a child of the 70's and a teen of the 80's so I grew up with ABBA (although I don't care for most of their music) and I adore almost every actor in this movie, especially Colin Firth. However, I put the blame for this terrible movie square on the shoulders of the director and editor. I read a review that said Mamma Mia looked like a rough cut, and I have to agree. Musicals inherently call for a suspension of belief--who spontaneously bursts into song in real life?--so the execution of the songs and choreography needs to be flawless. Not the case in this movie. And poor Pierce Brosnan! I give him props for stepping outside the acting box but he looked downright pained anytime he had to sing. Nothing in this movie was crisp or tight, and the ending was just flat. Dancing Queen is arguably ABBA's biggest hit and instead of using it as a finale in the story its stuck in the middle. I don't count the irritating rendition at the end. And don't get me started on the cheeze-tastic performance of Waterloo.

I was HIGHLY disappointed in this movie. I think it had much more potential and could have been a really great musical.",1236902400,31,1303,4.470588235294118

3614335,2,B001GKJ2DY,"Either way, I cannot believe the good reviews for this movie, not only those written here but the raves from my good friends and family who thought this film was so much fun!  I saw the Broadway show
during its opening week on Broadway in 2001 and it was sensational.
It was about a month or two after 9/11 and God knows New Yorkers needed something to take their minds of the recent tragic events and this show filled that request for 2 hours on an Autumn night, with singing and dancing in the aisles of the theater.  This film however, does not come close to the magic of the stage production.  It would have been nice to try and find actors that could actually sing and not just light up a marquee.  I used to think I could watch Colin Firth read the phone book - - maybe I still could but could not tolerate him singing one.  I am not going to explain the story
in this review as it has been done already.  All I can offer is a bunch of great actors that cannot sing who are all seriously miscast in a musical.  Go see the stage production - It's wonderful -

Performances are spot on, with average talent in some roles being lifted to very good by enthusiasm and professionalism--Brosnan is best example. The four leading ladies are  breathtaking.  It's not Abba, and not meant to be.  The Abba music is transformed into a different form by its original composers and criticizing it as 'pop' simply misses the point.  It was great music in the 70's (second only to the Beatles, worldwide) and has been re-imagined as great music in this century.",1236124800,3,591,4.86

But when you put them all together and try to spin a story based on the lyrics it is more than very very bad.  It is moronic.  The movie Hard Days Night was more imaginative.  Any episode of the Monkees flows more smoothly.

Sophie is supposed to be a 20 year old, and Donna was supposed to be young when she got pregnant and should be 40 years old or less. Streep is getting close to 60, so that was bad casting.

Pierce and the guys were gorgeous and all the girls were great and the generous sprinkle of fairy dust that the director got busy on was a magical idea, it enchanted all of us, but it was Meryl Streep that put the main ingredient in. After seeing Mamma Mia! I became an instant fan of hers and have sinced looked at all her movies. She is incredibly talented!

Meryl or anyone who knows Meryl, please tell her that the summer of 2008 got her tens of millions more fans and some are as young as my 13 year (then 12yrs) old girl and her friends.

3614370,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I used to like ABBA, until I saw Mama Mia! A horribly disjointed musical, where songs feel contrived to fit into the story; a story that doesn't seem to come together. Individual songs are usually done alright, but don't segue from one to another very well.

The cast butchered several of the songs, but especially S.O.S, Take A Chance On Me, and anything where Pierce Brosnan sang. On a side note, I also counted at least two violations of Chekov's Gun. And finally, I think it has a bad moral message. Which you only recognize if you manage to sit through the whole thing.

If there is justice in the world, cast members without established careers won't get to have them as punishment for the worst movies I've seen since The Talented Mr. Ripley.",1235692800,6,749,4.582089552238806

3614372,3,B001GKJ2DY,"For anyone who loves ABBA's timeless songs (including myself), it is hard to dislike ""Mamma Mia!"" In addition to those irresistible ABBA numbers, you've got nice locations (of the beautiful coast in Greece), plus the talented cast, veterans and newcomers. Sadly there are two things that ""Mamma Mia!"" doesn't have: story and direction.

Well, there is a story, but a very thin one. Three former boyfriends of Donna (Meryl Streep) travel to an old hotel Donna runs on a small island in Greece after so many years' absence. The three men (played by Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgrd and Pierce Brosnan) are in fact secretly invited by Donna's only daughter, 20-year-old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), who is going to be married.

You will be told that far in the first ten minutes and ... that's all. The entire cast did well (OK, Pierce Brosnan needs singling lessen, I admit). Obviously they had a good time making this film and you can feel that in the end credits, but ""Mamma Mia!"" stops there. The characters sing and dance and it is fun to see them doing it, but their dancing and songs, or the lyrics, need to be incorporated into the story. First-time director Phyllida Lloyd (who also did the stage version) just doesn't know the rhythm of filmed musical, missing the timing of music--how to build up the emotion and when to start and stop the tunes. The songs, great as they are, begin and end rather randomly.

Great musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"" have a good story to tell. You've got great songs and actors in ""Mamma Mia!"" but you need something more to draw the audience into the film's world. To do so ""Mamma Mia!"" depends upon the enthusiastic acting of the cast. You got Meryl Streep and she will not disappoint. Those who have seen such films as ""Postcards from the Edge"" and ""Ironweed"" know Meryl Streep can really sing. And she does not just sing, but bring energy to her performance and she does it again in ""Mamma Mia!"" Maybe too much of energy, but it is fun. With more subtlety, however, the film could have been better.",1235433600,5,2038,4.639889196675901

HOWEVER, I am in no rush to buy any movie in blue-ray until the prices come down.  They are totally over-rated, and definitely over-priced.

The songs, besides two, were not really rhythmic and the coreography did not wow (once more in exception to two.) I also did not like that every five minutes they broke into song- there was very little acting and alot of it was mediocre, the acting, the musical numbers and the vocalization/songs themselves. It had some good laughs- the comedy was the only thing that kept it alive in my book, but still getting through this film was not easy for me. I rate it a three because of its two highly coreographed and rhythmic songs and its comedic parts, otherwise I would have rated it a two.

Actors who cannot sing well, a director who must have been inspired by MTV videos, a poorly conceived production, all come together to nearly ruin a fine play and great music. Brosnan bombed as a singer. One of the funnest dances from the play  (with swim fins) was cut to a few seconds.  Sometimes the photography was so close it cut off arms and other parts of the actors who were dancing or otherwise needed to be seen.

3614382,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Twenty-two ABBA songs?  Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan?  A movie from a musical?  It actually works!  The story is simple.  Donna (mother Meryl Streep) was once a wild child and now, twenty years later has a daughter, Sophie who is getting married.  They run a rustic hotel on a tiny Greek island.  The trouble is, Sophie never knew who her father was and neither did Donna.  Sophie figures out it has to be one of three men, so she seceretly invites them while mother Donna invite her two best friends making a perfect excuse to team up three couples during a wedding.  That's it.  Really.

Even if you loathe ABBA, you'll find some good humor and songs here amidst the clever (if forced) storyline.  The songs and dancing action are non-stop, although some of the choreograophy could have been improved.  The visuals are stunning and Greece never looked so good.  Sure, some of the songs are goofball and corny, but they  carry the story and for the two male members of ABBA (Benny Andersson and Bjrn Ulvaeus) to have created such a monster hit is remarkable.  Yes, Meryl Streep really CAN sing as good as the rest of the cast, but Pierce Brosnan is horridly, inexplicably painful to listen to.  No matter.  It's a simple, light-hearted film with lots of good music and good feelings.  The ending is hilarious.  Its just a good time for all.

Mr. Brosnan isn't the greatest singer, but he does a good enough job not to detract from the overall movie.  And the locations are excellent, they really pop on the blue ray disc.

I love Merryl Streep and thought it might be sappy entertainment for us. Wow, right from the first song I thought this is not good. I kept hoping for it to take an upswing but it was by far the lamest movie I have ever seen. The singing was terrible, the songs were boring and made no sense (with the exception of ""dancing queen"" which was ok), the acting was hideous and the visuals were bad (sort of like viewing it with the sun in your eyes the whole time). The story line could have been good, something different anyway, but the music, lyrics, and acting were so bad, you really didn't care about the story anymore. Needless to say, my daughter and I looked at each other about 3/4 of the way through this movie and started laughing. Neither of us wanted to spoil it for the other with criticism, but we both hated it. So we turned it off. I bet I can guess how it ends, so obvious. Anyway, I cannot recommend this to anyone, even Streep fans like myself. Really, she should be ashamed. This movie was horrible.",1234742400,3,1180,4.272321428571429

What I didn't count on was how good the movie was and I'm very distressed to see that I find myself singing the songs and even buying the DVD.  Abba?  Julie Waters' version of ""Take a chance"" is wonderful and Streep's ""Winner takes it all"" made me cry.  Granted, Brosnan's singing is a tad painful but it was passable.

We sang to every song and had a ball.  Who cares if there weren't professional singers!  It was a entertaining, quirky movie with ABBA songs.  What could be more fun than that.

We plan to buy the movie and watch it again and again and have more bonding time.",1234569600,3,426,4.197530864197531
3614399,3,B001GKJ2DY,"I was anxiously waiting for this movie after seeing the play and listening to Abba's music often.  When I saw the movie in the theater it was good, the large screen with the dark theater made you feel like you were on a Greek Island witnessing this event.  Then I ordered the DVD and watched the movie at home - what a difference!  I thought to myself, ""This is a dumb movie"".

Everyone agrees, the music makes the movie.  The plot is thin and it is a silly premise.  It works on stage, because in the theater you can use your imagination.  It doesn't work in the movie.  Unfortunately, I do not think I will ever watch the DVD again; I can listen to the CD and enjoy the music without feeling like I am wasting my time.

Meryl Streep is good, she can do anything.  She displays many emotions, and does it well.  She looks like she had fun making the movie; I hope she was actually enjoying the Greek experience rather than being on a set in Hollywood.",1234569600,2,952,4.233333333333333

3614405,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I saw the Broadway musical ""Mama Mia"" which was great. I think the movie version is even better because stage has limitations on size & effects. Some of the singing performance in the movie version (like Brosnan) isn't as good. But, that doesn't take much away. The thing about ""Mama Mia"" that I find so appealing is that the story line and song lyrics blend perfectly. It's one continuous story, rather than a story interrupted by songs forced into it like so many musicals. The best blend I have ever seen.

""Mama Mia"" is something most of us can relate to. Middle age love crisis that's a product of youthful indiscretion.  People of two generations finding their true calling after years of uncertainty & soul searching.  ABBA rocks!!  It's a great combination. Some critics may not like this movie, but I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.",1234396800,3,837,4.56
3614406,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I got this on cable demand, where I could watch it and pay $4.99.  I thought it would be a bright, fun, guilty pleasure type movie to watch.  I like ABBA, and sometimes musicals are fun, like Chicago.  I didn't realize that by the end of it I'd want to stab myself and then blow myself up for good measure.  It was sickeningly embarrassing, the least of which was the singing, which yes, was atrocious.  Everything from the costuming to the direction to even the g-damn dance numbers left me exhausted and angry.  The casting was ridiculous.  Watching tired-looking bony horse-faced Christine Baranski fend off a young hottie while her bathing suit emphasized her wrinkled chest defied belief.  She's an attractive actress with a lot of brash sex appeal normally; couldn't they have made her look a little better?  Did Meryl have it in her contract that the other actresses couldn't outshine her luminous (goaty-looking) beauty?  And don't get me started on poor mannish elfin Julie Walters.  Watching her wrinkle up her face in song resembling an uncomfortable monkey and dry hump the air in her bad ugly hairdo with her short lumpy body encased in frumpy grandma clothes was beyond disgusting. I understand the premise that ""middle aged women are vibrant and horny too!!!"", but how these poor actresses were costumed only seemed to mock that.  Overall, the movie was the equivalent of listening to a loud toddler sing off key and pound spoons on a pot--perhaps adorable if you love him already, but vastly irritating to those of us who are normal and only hear it as noise.",1234396800,7,1575,4.792592592592593

All the songs from the movie were originally composed by ABBA. Very nice and touching songs.

However there were more songs than dialogue, which kind of made us bored after a little while. I also wished it didn't include these little inappropriate scenes because it could have been a great family movie.

Overall, the movie was nice to watch. I rank it second after Moulin Rouge.",1234396800,,623,4.447368421052632

3614420,5,B001GKJ2DY,"""Mama Mia"" is an entertaining fluffy, fizzy flick that will certainly not tax your brain. I've seen it three times on stage so was prepped for the movie version. It was fun to watch the way they movie-masters opened up the stage version to the panoramic natural setting of the beautiful Greek islands although the expansiveness didn't always click. Originally the musical's creators took some catchy Abba songs and wove them together into a plot-line that was above-average or more sophisticated than is usual when musical-makers start with a canon of songs.
 In Blu-Ray the Greek island settings are gorgeous. Meryl Streep is exceptionally good in this version as is Pierce Brosnan. Neither one comes over very well in the CD soundtrack when you can't see them acting because their voices can't carry the day alone. The entire cast does a creditable job.
Some of the musical numbers are way over-produced and over-peopled. Less would have been better. The early number ""Money, Money, Money"" is way over the top. The yacht scenes bear no reference to the island life and are a phony dream sequence. Some numbers are hectic, frenetic and seem like they're filmed in fast motion. There are too many extras bouncing up and down to the Abba beat and overpopulating the screen. Too many Greek peasant women and armies of dancers come advancing off the screen and into your lap. Everyone is dancing their hearts away.
Audiences unused to the unreality of the old-fashioned movie musicals are going to be overwhelmed by the overkill. We have forgotten how to suspend disbelief when it comes to the openness of musicals. Breaking into song has become bizarre for those unused to the old genre.
Meryl Streep uses her particular acting skills to put over certain numbers particularly ""The Winner Takes It All.""
It seems foolish to quibble about a movie that has a lot of laughs, burlesque turns, snappy popsicle music, a pretty good plot, and keeps you entertained.
The movie has a vitality, a joie de vivre that is certainly good for these hard economic times. Just don't expect Sondheim or Leonard Bernstein. The DVD is crammed with extra features for those who have the time. This is a movie for those who crave sheer exuberance.",1234310400,,2222,4.878306878306878

I also did not realise that I was in fact ordering a USA version which is completely useless in Spain on my player anyway.  So I shall not order anything from you again.  I think you should set up information pointing out that DVDs may not be compatible with European players so this error will not be repeated.

Okay, let's just say the story line is cheesy! The singing was horrible and the acting was bad on all counts.... I would have thought with the all star cast of Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Barabski, Julie Walters, and so on that this movie would have been great... at the very least acting wise!!

Now that I have the DVD, I'm looking forward to watching it many times.  It threads around a cute romantic comedy, and how do you best ABBA's music?  The songs, for the most part, are sung by people who do not sing professionally which makes it even more believable.  The scenery is to glory in, a breath of fresh air!

true). Cast, cinematography, DTS sound, and this film still could have
tanked. But, alas! Mamma Mia! roars into your frontal lobe and then infests your soul. What a trip.
A thin script it has an original premise, although I refuse
to hint at what it's about, lest you might guess how it ends up. Trust me-as have millions of other-- erudite-types, Mensa monkeys and film buffs.
you're in for 108 minutes of a living room get-away.
It's all filmed in
the kind of tropical island everybody wants to see though few ever get closer than a big screen and Blu-ay player.
Watching this film is a vicarious thrill and as close to being there. as need be. When  Ms. Streep sings
the title song and later, ""Dancing Queen"" you wonder if there's anything
she can't do. Her character REALLY does with style and good taste.
 All of which could be said for the entire film.",1233792000,,1004,4.572222222222222

3614438,5,B001GKJ2DY,"This movie had me from ""I had a dream..."" and I melted, swelled and streamed hot tears till the very end. I am honestly tired of critics that aim cynical shots at movies like this and call it ""mere fluff"" or ""bad technical direction"" etc.

Yes some movies may deserve it- but not this. The idea that this movie is just ""mere fun"" and a bad adaption is ludicrous!

I think the opposite. Movies like this evoke a passion in us that fires our spirit and maddens our souls. It engages us, makes us want to leap, to celebrate, to sing to dance to burst through our skin and scream with pleasure and joy! I'm sorry but cynicism is SO 1990-2006. It's tired, old, tedious and an old bore.

The ""elitist"" pretentious negative take on this film is just that- pretentious just to BE pretentious. There isn't any solid foundation behind their dry criticism. Technically it's NOT perfect- but passion, character, and explosive beauty can override the film flaws- if you will. Of course we must have critics. I myself share my opinions on anything and everything. It's what makes us work harder and strive to be better. To see what we wouldn't see ourselves- pointed out to us by others who want to be constructive.

However, I am tired of people saying such work like this is ""mere fun"". I'm sorry but the fact that this is moving and celebratory and shakes you to your core with pure vivacious power IS what life is about. Yes it IS fun- but it's about Love and Friendship and beautiful human nature interacting and adoring and loving each other- all expressed in music that is ALIVE and BEAUTIFUL!

There's a lot of schlock out there that receives critical acclaim b/c it's dark, avant-garde, disturbing, shocking, etc. and quite frankly- a lot of the time it's a formula for pretention. God forbid we should give a wink to a movie that flushes your soul out to your skin and gives you the delightful shivers- and makes you want to throw a party and kiss all your loved ones.

I love the rush of it- the imperfection- the way it's thrown together and grabs you and tosses you into the mix, drinking in the lushness and dancing with sheer abandon.

FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!

Yikes.  I have always been a Streep fan, but I have never seen anything like this.  I don't know what they did to her, but throughout most of this film - I will blame the director, choreographer and editors - she is so manically jubilant and expressive and hyper-active that I was afraid the poor woman had developed an addiction to chrystal meth!

In fact, most of the cast fairs poorly.  Only Julie Walters seems to realize that she is in the midst of one enormous joke.  For all the mania and energy forced upon these people, their dealiest flaw is that they seem to be taking this whole story seriously.

The term ""Greek Chorus"" has never been so horrifyingly real.  Words cannot express.

3614462,2,B001GKJ2DY,"Back in the eighties when ABBA packed the pop charts, Eddie Murphy's hilarious promotional parody ""Buckwheat Sings"" featured a black member of the Our Gang/Little Rascals ensemble. As living proof that reality can be stranger than Murphy, Pierce Brosnan, who famously stole the identity of Remington Steele in the 80s series of the same name, is cast as a putative father and singer in Mamma Mia! In this role, Brosnan unsuccessfully attempts to carry a tune in a bucket.

First the good part-this is a gorgeous movie in Blu-ray. The blue and green hues of a Greek isle, festooned with red and purple flowers and sun-bleached masonry are breath-taking. Movies like this were truly meant to be enjoyed on Blu-ray.

Now the bad part-high end audio quality does nothing to enhance the croak of Mr. Brosnan's voice. In fact the producers should have realized that before committing to a Blu-ray edition that accentuates the negatives of one of many casting catastrophes.

Basically even though The Streep can sing, she (and her entourage of girlfriends and ex-boyfriends) are about fifteen years older than the plot credibly envisions. Nearly sixty-something women with twenty year old daughters had them either late in life or not at all. The premise after all is that Streep's daughter is about the same age as her mother when she was conceived by one of the three ex-boyfriends. Instead we see a Geritol-swigging parental generation dancing and singing with kids young enough to consider Leonardo diCaprio an elder statesman.

All of this just goes to show that marquee stars alone cannot a film make. As to Mr. Brosnan's singing, his vocal coach, depending on what he or she had to start with, deserves either an Oscar for best special effects or to be run out of town on a rail.",1233532800,12,1779,4.880794701986755

The film, perhaps even moreso than the stage version, is campy and silly and demands you suspend your disbelief and hang on for the ride. If you're in a mood to be purely entertained and need an antitode to the recession and all the dark films of 2008, then pour a glass of wine, turn down the lights, cue up Mamma Mia! and have a good laugh. (Maybe even a tear or two.) As on stage, the producers sought actors who fit the roles well with -- particularly the males -- ordinary voices. But the instrumental backing tracks are outstanding, faithful to the originals, lovingly recreated by Benny Andersson and many of the original ABBA backing musicians.

I didn't have too high expectations when my mum dragged me along to see it in the theatre, I thought it would be just another desperate cheesy attempt from Hollywood to make money, having run out of original movie ideas, all they could think of was to make a movie out of a stage musical. Boy was I proven wrong big time! Not only were there a cast of well-known great actors, but the thing that surprised me the most was that Meryl Streep had an amazing singing voice, as did her ""daughter"" Amanda Seygfried whom to me was not heard of until I saw this movie. Starting off with the first pure, beautiful lines of ""I Have A Dream"" sung to perfection by Seygfried, we're off to a greek island with breathtaking scenery and the party is on, going from one Abba hit song to another, helping to run the story and you'll find yourself tapping your feet along to the beat, singing along to some of Abba's biggest hits being performed in this movie, surprisingly well-sung by a talented cast of actors (all except for Pierce Brosnan, who, in my opinion, should stick to acting). I bet they all must've had a lot of fun shooting this movie and it definitely shows by their great performances. Streep and Seygfried were the ones that stood out the most for me and I can now see why Meryl has gotten so much praise in the past, she definitely shows what an amazing actress she is in this movie and this has made me want to see other movies she's been in as well. As for Seygfried, she's a talent to watch out for, she is onto big things in her career.

3614474,2,B001GKJ2DY,"I love ABBA and their music very much, and I wish I could rate this musical movie a 5 star rating, but I can't. I have no other choice but to give this movie 2 stars.

When I first watched this movie, I was kinda confused or I couldn't quite make out what the dialogue was talking about. Now that I've watched it a few more times and read some of the other reviews here helped me get a better perspective. Now, I have mixed feelings about this movie.

First the positive, I enjoyed the scenery and orchestrated dancing and performing near the pretty blue waters. I was surprised to see Benny appearing for 2 seconds in the song ""dancing queen"" and Bjorn appearing at the end as a Greek God. Although I've heard of most of the songs before this movie, but I was introduced to ""slipping through my fingers"", which is the only song I don't have on any of my ABBA CD's. Lastly, I feel the need to talk about this but, for a PG-13 rating that this movie didn't have any of the F-word, S-word, or the B-word, which was wonderful.

Now to the negative, the songs sung by Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan didn't exactly get my attention. I mean the only ones who can sing ABBA's songs is ABBA personally. Furthermore, I wasn't too thrilled in some of the sexual comments on the movie. Plus, I was kind of disappointed at all the finger-pointing, borderline feminism, rejection, and crude houndlike behavior coming from both male and female so-called companions. And we wonder why there's people in the world who have been known to avoid relationships.

So what is my expressed opinion for Mamma Mia? I would have to say Average, or Fair.",1233273600,3,1628,4.453020134228188

And I have to say I was more or less pleasantly surprised. No one had told me this was the ""ABBA musical."" The plot, as befits a musical, is pretty simple. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of an American hotel-owner on one of the Greek islands, is about to be married. Her mother, Donna (Streep), was a hippie chick back in her youth, sleeping with whomever she liked whenever she pleased, and when she got pregnant her own parents barred her from returning. She's not even sure which of three different guys is the baby's father. But Sophie has found mama's diary and culled the three names, and has invited all three now middle-aged potential fathers to the wedding. So Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgaard turn up and the games begin. It's all lighthearted and fun, but the real enjoyment for me was in the fact that every single number is an old ABBA tune, from ""Chiquita"" and ""Slipping through My Fingers"" through the boisterous production number, ""Dancing Queen."" It's also a relief to know that even I am a better singer than Pierce Brosnan. There's not a lot of the actor-character chemistry necessary to hold a successful musical together (think John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John), but it's worth watching for the music.

3614482,5,B001GKJ2DY,"This movie reminds me of the romantic comedy musicals of the 1930's: nothing more than pure escapism during tough economic times. Those classic musicals were full of catchy songs, hot stars, and storylines that were fun if not highly improbable. But nobody cared because it was the Depression and anything was better than reality. ""Mamma Mia!"" fits this mold - it's the escapist movie for the Great Recession of 2008-2009. It's full of catchy ABBA music many people know and love. It has hot stars, including the best actress of our day, Meryl Streep (is there a role she can't do?). It takes place on an idyllic Grecian island far away from the problems of the modern world. And it has the rather improbable, but fun, storyline of a bride-to-be inviting three of her mother's past lovers to her wedding to see which one is her real dad. Though musicals are pretty much out of fashion these days, ""Mamma Mia!"" is a bit more accessible to the masses. It uses familiar pop tunes and the singers are pretty average, lending them a more human quality. No polished Broadway voices of the likes of Barbra Streisand or Julie Andrews to make you feel inadequate. You can actually sing along with the actors and not feel out of place (in fact, the DVD contains optional sing-along captions just for the purpose!).

However, I'm a little confused at the hype around this movie. Many of the songs just don't make any sense. The whole time that Pierce Brosnan, who really shouldn't be cast in a scene where he sings, is singing to Meryl Streep about how can he go on when she's gone, I'm wondering what he's talking about since he hasn't seen her in twenty years. The only way to enjoy this movie is to never ask what anyone is talking about or why they are doing what they are doing. If you can look at the movie as a series of unrelated music videos then you will be OK.",1233014400,6,730,4.251798561151079

It is quite apparent from the very beginning that they had fun while shooting the movie and some of this fun stayed on the celluloid. All you have to do is go with the flow. Don't judge. Don't count the moments when things go wrong vocally. Don't count the moments when the story-line gets thin. Just let it happen to you. It's OK if you always have full control of yourself and you would never do anything as outrageous as singing in public when you have no voice. Have you ever thought that you might be missing something in your life (OK - your near and dear may actually be quite grateful for your not trying to sing) just because you don't have the courage?

3614488,3,B001GKJ2DY,"I have never seen the stage show of ""Mamma Mia"" so I can't compare the movie to it, but friends raved about it.  Comparing their opinion of the stage show to the movie, I believe this movie could have been much better than it was.

My overall comment is that the casting choices were interesting -- and not in a good way -- for a musical.  Perhaps the best feature of the DVD is the option to put it on sing-along mode so you can belt out the great ABBA tunes and not have to hear some of the less-than-fabulous cast singing.

First, Pierce Brosnan should never sing anywhere but his shower; and then only if no one is around to hear him.  I used to believe that studio ""tweaking"" could make anyone sound halfway decent.  If that's the best they could do with his voice, he must have been just awful.  Didn't anyone ask him to sing before casting him?  There are many actors old enough to be the father of a 20-year-old; they could have found one who could sing.

Colin Firth is probably too young for his role; he's a decade younger than Ms. Streep and the other guys.  He and Stellan Skrsgard sang better than Pierce Brosnan, but neither one is really a singer.  Meryl Streep does OK with the vocals but that role has the most singing so it would have been better to cast a singing actress, like Patti LuPone.  The best cast role is the daughter; Amanda Seyfried did a good job.

I loved the setting and the staging of the group musical numbers was good.  And of course the ABBA songs that are the whole point of the musical.  I think if the producers had gone with a cast of singers rather than big name stars, the movie would have been much better.  I'll also note that parents should think about the movie's message before deciding whether to let their children watch it.  In the wedding scene, the daughter tells her mother it's OK she slept around so much she doesn't know who her father is and decides she doesn't want to get married either but just see the world with her fianc.  What's wrong with seeing the world as a married couple?",1232928000,3,2044,4.320209973753281

3614493,3,B001GKJ2DY,"Being a long time ABBA fan, I really looked forward to watching this movie. From the previews I saw on TV, I thought it would be an excellent movie...and in many ways it is! First, let me elaborate on the not so good aspects of this movie:

1. The plot, I feel, is too simple. Basically, it is about a mother, played by Meryl Streep, who supports herself and her 20 year old daughter Sophie by running a hotel somewhere in Greece. Sophie is about to be married, but before she does, she wants to find out who her biological father is, so she invites 3 men that her mother was involved with way back in the day in order to determine this. Sophie feels that she will know her father on the spot, but rather, feels some connection to all of them. Even though this plot is quite emotional, I feel it falls short in the way it plays out. A more complex plot would have helped the movie.
2. The singing was mediocre and at times very disappointing. None of the actors in this movie could sing well. After some thinking, I concluded that maybe this was intentional, or at the very least, not a priority. In other words, perhaps the people who made this movie did not intend to get good singers, but ordinary people who felt inspired to sing.
3. The acting was at times awkward and non-flowing. I was not always convinced of genuine feeling by the actors and their dialogue.

Alright, now for the good aspects:

1. Wonderful scenery: wow, the scenery in this movie was breath-taking. Filmed in Greece, the water was pristine and blue, the beaches immaculate, and the hotel was a spectacle, full of architectural charm. I also loved the costumes that the actors wore. Whoever was in charge of wardrobe was a genius, as were the people who decorated the hotel and that lovely series of lights that led up that ridge to the church where the wedding took place.
2. Charming actors: I've alluded to awkward acting above, but I really got a sense that the actors really had a fun time making this movie. Perhaps it was more exciting to be a participant in this movie than an onlooker. There was an infectious sense of elation as the actors sang and danced and frolicked around, not a care in the world. Meryl Streep was comic with the caulking compound. The actress who played Sophie was very good at playing a slightly naive and innocent part. Perhaps her career will take off with this movie, as I thought her acting was the best.
3. Even though the singing wasn't stellar, the songs certainly were! Any fan of ABBA will easily recognize the plethora of ABBA's greatest songs. I also think that the songs were appropriately placed as the movie's events unfolded. It is good for the seasoned ABBA fan, as well as people who are new to ABBA.

Well, thus ends my review! Hope this review helps people who are eager to see this movie. I hope you all have a great day!

The movie was both insulting and condescending. Insulting in its misogyny towards men, disrespect for the role of the father, wreaking of immorality and crudeness, lack of a plot or storyline, poor vocals, and (time permitting) probably everything else. Condescending in that I came away from the movie feelings as if the participants colluded and conspired to try an experiment to see if they could put out a stupid movie to see if people would actually buy it, and to fleece people when they did. $$$$$$$$$$$$. It's always about the money. Produced by Tom Hanks? Give me a break. One of Steven Spielberg's best buds. For real?

First, I bought this screen ""gem."" Then I laughed watching it last night because it was so utterly ridiculous. Then, I sold it today, happily losing only $6 on it. $6 too much though. I assume that the person who bought it made an intelligent purchase, but I've lost enough money on lousy movies already like the Dark Knight (more stellar reviews) for instance. I would not allow myself to lose the entire amount I paid for it.

What is it about people today? Have they lost their minds? Have they gone totally ka blue e? It's popular delusions and the madness of crowds isn't it? And the fascination with Meryl Streep and her jumping up and down on a bed. All totally unreal. Too much kool-aid I fear. Next, someone will simply have to do a ""movie"" on all out human depravity.

3614511,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this movie, but by the third song (if you count the abbreviated ""I Have a Dream"" in the opening as a full song), I had suspended all disbelief (the plot is, admittedly, rather contrived) and was completely enjoying the heck out of this show.  Suddenly, all these old Abba songs from my youth (I was still in single-digits during most of the '70s) came rushing back, and I couldn't help but sing along.  My six-year-old son has been singing bits and pieces of ""Mamma Mia"" ever since!  This movie isn't particularly profound (although, as a mother of two girls who are growing up too quickly, the song ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" was quite poignant) -- if you're looking for that, see ""Hotel Rwanda"" (an outstanding movie that horribly reveals to anyone who didn't pay attention -- which was most of the world -- the terribly real extremes of man's inhumanity to man).  ""Mamma Mia"" is, however, quite entertaining, and the events play out to a happy ending for all the main characters.  Thanks for the music, Abba!",1232409600,,1057,4.661290322580645

3614514,1,B001GKJ2DY,"My wife and I tried watching Mamma Mia.  We both love the music of ABBA since it was the music of our youth.  And the storyline seemed promising enough too.  It's a premise that reminds me of old time London stage comedies (the ones where misunderstandings and confused identities lead to unexpected and hilarious twists in the plot).  Well, we turned it off after 20 minutes.  When the characters aren't singing, it's dreadful.  The dialog is really over-the-top; some lines are screamed instead of spoken.  Each character has a different accent too.  It's tough on my ear and jarring to my brain to go from Scottish to American to Aussie to Euro English, all in the span of 15 seconds.  And so, I silently prayed for the next song to come in order to be put out of my misery.  The songs, as ABBA fans know, are classics.  But when one listens to the songs in the movie (which aren't sung by ABBA but rather by the actors), one thinks of how far superior the original versions are.  After 60 seconds of singing, one really appreciates how far superior the original versions are.  When the song is done, one realizes how far inferior these movie versions are!  Then it's back to mind-numbing dialog that is not at all witty or well-delivered ... just loud, annoying, and obnoxious.  Perhaps in the 21st minute of the film, the movie gets better, but who knows?  We never made it that far.  Instead, we put in the Fiddler on the Roof DVD and had a good time with Tevye and Tzeitel.",1232323200,20,1480,4.48314606741573

I haven't seen the Broadway show but it has to be better than this to have run 8 years on Broadway (and still going!).  This movie was stupid, silly, and painful to watch.  The scenery was nice but who spends this kind of money to make a movie and then not hire any professional singers and not dub the singing voices?  OK, Christine Baranski is a Broadway vet .. but she doesn't get to sing as much as Meryl Streep (who at least tries but looks particular silly and out of place, especially using her bed like a trampoline)and Pierce Brosnan ... PIERCE BROSNAN?  It was actually painful to watch him belting out a number of tunes.  He can't sing. He can't even pretend to sing ... so ""sing"" softly .. don't scream it out to bring the point home that you are TERRIBLE.  I couldn't believe how bad this movie is from beginning to end.

3614524,4,B001GKJ2DY,"I'm an ABBA fan.  I bought the soundtrack to the musical before, but something about the sound or tone of songs made me not like it. I disliked it so much, I had to sell it off.  Didn't even want it in my music library.

So here comes the movie production.  It didn't excite me much because, so far, many of the movie adaptations have fallen flat.

I finally watch the video months later after it is released, and find myself enjoying it.  Enough to keep going, rather than be turned off by some of the earlier, contrived musiscal numbers.  In the end, it was not just a smile here, a memory there (what with the ABBA songs) but a few days later, I am still thinking about the songs and the scenes they went with.  I'd have to say, get a chance to watch it if you can.

Now as for the movie itself, I felt like Evita, Phantom of the Opera, and Mamma  Mia movies suffered from the same problem.  This problem is that, the singing doesn't seem like part of the movie.  Breaking out in dance and musical choreography is something I can accept with no issue, but the singing parts feel like they are dubbed in at the studio to have higher sound quality.  As a result, the talking scenes seem so mellow and are only intended to lead into the song numbers, which then take over your sound system with full orchestra and loudness and clarity.  It takes away from feeling like the characters are really singing the song as part of the movie, but rather, you are watching an MTV music video.

Short of this, ""Mamma Mia"" made me think about all the ABBA songs I liked, during and days after watching it.  I think Colin Firth sang the best out of the all guys, but I liked them all.",1232323200,2,1671,4.2405063291139244

Mamma Mia suits the mood, soothes that 30 year old memory of listening to ABBA songs.  This movie is really cheesy in some parts, but that's easily overlooked while you're tapping your toe and singing along under your breath!

Other than the songs we all know (Waterloo, Mamma Mia, etc.) the rest of the songs were mediocre at best.  The only actor worth watching was the daughter, played by Amanda Seyfried.

And the pop catchy comes through in the movie.  The movie is visually wonderful and Greece looks absolutely beautiful, and Meryl Streep gives her usual first class performance and sings very well. Amanda Seyfried (from Big Love) was also a pleasent suprise in her perforrmance and vocals.

I love Julie Walters.  She is one of my favorite actresses.  I am just such a huge fan and hated that she wasn't on some of the covers.

I cannot get enough of the exuberance, the joy, the singing, the incredible dancing, the humor and the talent that has been brought together in this movie.  Even Pierce Brosnan gets 5 stars for effort.  I love Mama Mia  Stanorth",1231632000,2,573,4.080357142857143
3614641,4,B001GKJ2DY,"This is a 2-disc special edition starring Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, extremely talented veteran actors who have starred in many many movies.  I grew up watching musicals, so it was refreshing to see one today.  Although the plot is a tad weak, and many of the songs are not exactly Rogers and Hammerstein, there are good musical numbers throughout the movie with lots of singing and dancing.  Much (or maybe all?) of the music is Abba. I guess I would say that some of the music is great and some is just ok.  Pierce Brosnan (bless his little heart) sings 3 songs.  Now, he is not exactly Mario Lanza but his numbers add to the overall production (and I'll leave it at that.) EVERYBODY sings in this musical, which is great.

The movie opens (and continues) with beautiful scenery.  A wee bit of the film (in the beginning) was filmed in London, but most of the production was filmed in Greece, on 2 small islands and on the mainland (Skopelos, Skiathos, and Mouresi-Magnesia).  Raised on the Greek island of Kalokairi by her unmarried mom Donna (Meryl), beautiful and delicate 20-year old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) explains to her girlfriends, Lisa and Ali, how she has always felt ""empty"" not knowing who her father is. She got her little paws on Donna's diary, and in reading the exciting parts (the ""dot, dot, dot"" parts), she determines that one of Donna's 3 past boyfriends just HAS to be Daddy.  Let's see--Is it Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Harry (Colin Firth), or Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?

Sophie is about to marry Sky (Dominic Cooper), so while Donna is sending out invitations to her best friends, Rosie, the stuff-your-vegetables cookbook writer (Julie Walters) and Tanya, the vixen whose 3rd husband paid for her plastic surgery (Christine Baranski), Sophie sends out some invitations too. Sophie invites Bill, Harry, and Sam!  When Sophie signs Donna's name to the invitations, the guys leave their digs and come to Kalokairi for the wedding.  All the time, the guys are wondering why Donna invited them to her daughter's wedding when they haven't heard from Donna in 20 years. Sophie wants her Daddy to give the bride away at the wedding, so she hides the guys in Donna's villa-hotel, but Donna finds them.  Of course, the plot takes off from here but it is pretty simplistic.  There is not a whole lot more that happens.  As i said before, the attention is more on the music. Chick-flick?  Yeah.  I guess it is.

Bonus features include a sing-along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers; a deleted musical number, and a commentary with the director.  Special Edition exclusives are:
1) The making of Mamma Mia! the movie;
2) Anatomy of a musical number ""Lay All Your Love On Me"";
3) Becoming a Singer;
4) Behind the Scenes with Amanda;
5) On Location in Greece;
6) A Look Inside the Movie;
7) ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme"" Music Video;
8) Bjorn Ulvaues Cameo;
9) Deleted Scenes and Outtakes; and
10) Digital Copy of the movie (that you can download to your ipod, but you need an internet connection and the password that they give you on the insert).

I gave this 4 stars because i kinda averaged it out, which I don't normally do in my reviews.  I gave the storyline a 3, because I thought the plot was much too simplistic, realizing though that the director likely put more attention on the musical part of the production.  I gave the music and dancing a 4, because some of the songs were great and some were just ok,  I gave the gorgeous scenery a 5.  The acting while singing deserved a 4 or 5.  I especially liked the feeling that Meryl put into ""The Winner Takes It All"" scene during her discussion with Pierce right before the wedding, on a cliff in Greece.

I would have liked to hear a little Greek music here and there, since they were in Greece (Duh!).  I think I only heard one Greek word in the whole movie (Duh--again). A little unrealistic. But, there was a lot n of singing and dancing, some great numbers, great choreography, many great songs, and sometimes large numbers of townspeople joining in the productions.  I found myself laughing out loud a few times and it was a real feel-good movie--very entertaining. I did enjoy it and would watch it again.  The bonus features were also entertaining.

Just DON'T make the same mistake I did!  I watched this movie right before bedtime, so I heard ""Dancing Queen"" in my head ALL NIGHT LONG!!!",1231632000,3,4371,4.659713168187745

Its also great to get an extra dose of Meryl Streep singing in some of the extras. She's kept her wonderful singing voice from the movie audience largely hidden but actually was in a lot of complicated singing roles on stage early in her career.

Balance this out with the painful process of listening to Pierce Brosnan sing (makes the case for dubbing) and the last star is lost.

3614687,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I have to say that I really enjoyed ""Mamma Mia."" I don't like to watch movies much these days because I am really hard of hearing. My youngest son bought me earphones to use to watch and listen to the news and my favorite programs. So when he brought home ""Mamma Mia,"" he insisted I could watch the movie with the family. He even played the words to the song at the bottom of the screen. What fun we had!

After he played the movie one time, all the great-grandkids (we are a multi-generational family in this house) clamored for him to play it again. So he did. I think we had more fun the second time watching the movie and singing along. I never watch a movie a second time, so this was probably a first for me but I did it because we were having such a great time. Can you imagine one movie bringing such joy?

My great-grand-daughter is an American Idol fan and plans to sing on the show one day. She showed me how she will perform with the song ""Mamma Mia."" She might win.

Anyway, the story. I didn't like that the children had to hear about how Meryl Streep slept with three men in one summer and didn't know the father of her child. The rest of the story was entertaining in showing us how the daughter ""found"" her father. After the movie, we all talked about our favorite song. Mine was the women throwing down their laundry and other work and joining the women's right-to-have-fun song (that's what it looked like to me). It was fun watching them all dance the same movements.

3614689,2,B001GKJ2DY,"My wife knew she was going to love Mamma Mia, and she did. I expected to have mixed reactions, because while I adore Meryl Streep, I never liked the music of ABBA.

My reactions weren't mixed at all. I hated Mamma Mia: the acting, the story line, the music, the lip-synching, the dancing. It was frivolous, shallow, vapid.

Yeah, so? All musicals are frivolous, yet there are many I love. Cabaret. The 2005 version of The Producers. The Sound of Music. What was it about Mamma Mia that riled me so?

I think I hated Mamma Mia because it was such a transparently cynical attempt to exploit a stereotype: the ""female demographic"" pandered to by morning news & entertainment shows, The View, Oprah & Doctor Phil, Access Hollywood. I suppose there are women who fit that stereotype, just as there are men who fit the ""male youth demographic"" stereotype movies like Transformers aim at.  But I don't have to like it.

Meryl, how could you? Where's your pride?",1231545600,3,954,4.654761904761905

My mother in law made me watch this movie and I have to say at first viewing I was struck mostly by the fact that everyone seemed to run everywhere and they were all hyperactive! I didn't expect much singing ability because lets face it...they are actors not singers. I did enjoy it the first time but never thought I'd see it again.
Well, 2 days later after finding that the music would not leave my head I decided I must watch it again to get it out!!! Well, I have to say I loved this movie on the second watching! If you just let yourself go with it it is great fun. Pierce Brosnan seems a better singer..maybe because you're expecting it this time. They all seemed better. I found myself laughing with the movie rather than at it. I think once the surprise of seeing such well known dramatic actors singing abba has passed you can look at the movie for what it is...a fun bit of entertainment!

I was wrong.
It tried too hard in some places, not enough in others, and plodded along for the most part.
The pretense was actually quite the setup for a good comedy. Strong actors was a good move also and the location was great! The unfolding of the plot was weak, at best. And it seemed some of the songs just didn't fit well to what was going on.
I'm not sure what I would have done differently here... the story was made to be wrapped around songs by the group ABBA. These songs weren't written for that purpose and therefore the fit just isn't quite right.
This is definitely a chick flick and geared for the teen section. Which I'm sure it will win over. Myself?  I watched it and returned it. Don't think I'll watch it again.",1231545600,3,868,4.2926829268292686

I suffered through an hour and fifty minutes of for the most part terrible singing and hyperactive acting.  If your idea for entertainment is listening to Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep sing then go ahead and enjoy.

Yes the actors looked like they enjoyed themselves and the song Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia were fun, that is why I gave it two stars rather then one.  I felt the acting was over the top and I caught myself laughing at the movie rather then laughing because it was actually funny.

I sat down on a cold January 4th and watched it.  I love it!
I think my favorite part of the movie is Dancing Queen.  I loved how the older woman carrying sticks on her back just threw them down and joined in the fun.
By the way, the other reason I wanted to watch it is because it has Colin Firth in it.  Not bad on the vocals.
As for Pierce, back off people I have heard a lot worse.  I think it catches you off guard more than anything.  I have watched it twice now and even the second time, I really don't think he sounds that bad.
It says a lot throwing yourself into a role that is completely different from what you normally do.  He took a chance and had some fun.

I have long admired her as an exceptional actress, but her choice to do this film raises my admiration even more, because it shows she knows how to have fun!

What a disappointment. The singing was terrible (with the exception of the daughter) and the acting just as bad. I haven't seen a musical this embarrassing since ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (which at least had decent singing but was still so bad it managed to effectively kill the careers of both the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton).",1231372800,14,515,4.548387096774194

I have been looking forward to seeing the film, especially with Meryl Streep on board.  The cast is great BUT what a miserable disaster this movie is.  The mistake is that the director has filmed a STAGESHOW.  The movie is exhausting!  Everyone RUNS and no one seems to walk.  The production numbers blend into one.  The facial expressions are all overdone.  In other words, a stageshow has been filmed.  A total disappointment.  I was also NOT IMPRESSED with the actors - Julie Walters looked terrible, the men were hopeless and had no singing voices and even Meryl Streep was not at her best.  The three women were also disappointing.  A total flop for me .......... but I am sure that I am in the minority here just as I was when ABBA first burst on the scene back in the 70's.  Makes you remember just how good the Beatles really were!",1231372800,13,1028,4.462365591397849
3614725,4,B001GKJ2DY,"While my two-year old great nephew was derailing a runaway Lionel train around the Christmas tree and had totally wrecked a ranch-style plastic home, my other great nephews and great niece were exhorting me to open the presents they brought me. Knowing I had seen the play on Broadway three times and once in Toronto, it was no surprise that ""Momma Mia,"" the DVD was behind the decorative Christmas paper. ""Oh, can we watch it, Uncle Ed?"" (If ever a gift could keep on giving right back to the givers)!

Even though Meryl Streep is old enough to be a grandmother (and probably is), the camera never gets too close to her face, as she plays a barely middle-aged mother of a love-struck daughter on the verge of marriage. The daughter discovers that Mom was a bit wilder in her youth having made love to three men at approximately the same time. The plot unfolds when she decides to invite her ""fathers"" to the wedding without her mother's knowledge. MOMMA MIA!

This is loosely based on a late 60's movie titled ""Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell,"" where the twist is that Gina Lollabrigitta tells three American World War II veterans that they are the father of her son. Their guilt and money provide for the same. Only here, the setting is an unnamed Greek isle instead of Italy, and mom is barely scraping by running what can be charitably called an inn.

An unabashed ABBA fan, I enjoy each hit over and over again, and could play them all day. I play them when I am in a good mood, and when I need to get in a good mood. The music from this can be found on the CD for the movie (d'uh), or ABBA Gold, which has every one but, ""I do.""

So, love me or leave me, but please don't deceive me, because I won't deceive you. Meryl Streep reveals her absolute depth in her performance. Her ending with her co-stars is a triumph of harmony on stage or at Waterloo where Napoleon did surrender. Pierce Brosnan's bellowing efforts might make you want to suck on a lemon while someone is running steel fingernails across a blackboard, but the movie is fun even in a rich man's world, or for a super trouper. The supporting cast was superb. I was particularly impressed with Julie Walters who played one of Meryl Streep's adult sidekicks. Christine Baranski was predictably good. I never imagined that Stellan Skaarsgard could kick up a storm the way he did.

My gift included a trailer that allowed the viewer to see the making of the movie, and the songs being replayed in the movie with the words appearing, but without the bouncing ball. It helped me learn a lot of the correct words that men seem to have a harder time identifying them than women do when it comes to song. (Up to age 50, I thought Popeye was strong to the ""pinach"" cuz I eats me spinach).

Do I recommend this DVD? I ask in all honesty, without a song or dance what are we? So I say thank you for the music, (and the DVD,) for giving it to me. Just remember there is no comparison between this and what you would see on Broadway, in Toronto or Peoria at Route 24, Junction 8, for that matter. The movie could only leave you disappointed. It is entertaining especially if you are forgiving of Streep and Brosnan not being singers.

Thank you, Christian, Gabriella, Samuel Adam, and Emmanuel.

3614731,2,B001GKJ2DY,"I've never seen the original stage version of Mamma Mia and for no other reason that the idea simply didn't appeal to me.  I took a chance on the movie version for one reason and one reason only:  Its cast.  With the possible exception of Pierce Brosnan, I love all of these actors, especially Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, Colin Firth and Christine Baranski, whose previous work I've greatly admired.  This is not so terrible a film as some people have stated.  All I can say to those who love to stamp every movie they don't like with the headline ""worst film I've ever seen"" is that frankly, if this inoffensive little concoction is the worst movie you've ever seen, then you're an extremely lucky movie goer, because I've seen some dogs that make Mamma Mia look like ""A Man For All Seasons.""  The main problem I had with this movie was with my own personal inability to separate the songs from the original artist.  To me it was like watching the ultimate chick flick with some pretty bad renditions of ABBA songs used as a narrative device.  If you're not a longtime ABBA fan and are not too familiar with these classic and first rate examples of pop music, it'll probably not make much difference to you who sings them and how they're sung, but in my head I just kept hearing the originals and couldn't help but feel they were the sole glue holding together an otherwise trite and boring story about young love, female camaraderie and rediscovering the joys of love.  To boot, the script is threadbare and makes no impact whatsoever on the viewer.  In short, fantastic songs, badly sung (for the most part) and used in a really mediocre vehicle.  I'll say this though, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, the location is awesome and it's a harmless enough little movie that the ladies, especially, will like.  The men, though, will no doubt be rolling their eyes and checking their watches begging to be put out of their misery.  I know I was.  Wholly forgettable in spite of its best intentions and first rate cast.",1231286400,8,2028,4.612813370473537

3614766,3,B001GKJ2DY,"A young woman, raised by a single parent mother, prepares for her upcoming wedding on a Greek island. Upon finding her mother's old diary, she discovers that her unknown father could have been one of three men. She invites all three to attend her wedding, on the juvenile assumption that she will ""know"" her father when she meets him. Of course she tells neither her mother nor the three men of her plans. The plot is similar to the much better ""Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell"" (1968).

The story is woven around a large number of songs from the 70s musical group ABBA. The film's shortcoming is that there are simply too many songs and not enough story. The thinly-plotted story is merely an excuse to sing and dance, which is why I called it a revue. Consequently, we learn very little about the three men, surely the past lives and personalities of her potential fathers would be of great interest to the girl. All we learn about them is that one is a sort of adventure-travel writer, and the other two are suit-wearing businessmen - one of whom is gay, the other divorced.

Acting, from both youthful and veteran actors is at the flamboyant, gushy, everything is a crisis, teenage level. The singing and dancing are good, though not the original ABBA recordings.

3614776,5,B001GKJ2DY,"A cold, gloomy, nasty afternoon in a hotel in Canada. Five hours until warm-up time in the orchestra pit. Take a walk? Ni modo, Quasimodo! Rent a flick? Why not!

You'll have to believe me that I have no prior ABBA consciousness, despite the fact that I spent half my childhood in Sweden. I was in Mediterranean and Caribbean lands when they 'conquered' the Anglophone pop music world. I heard or read the name. Honestly, I thought they were another 'heavy metal' or Swedish vampyr band. I had no idea what they looked or sounded like. My wife tells me now that we danced to ABBA covers at innumerable family weddings over the past 25 years, but I never pay much attention when I'm trying to shake my booty without looking as dorky as I feel. Okay, do I suddenly love their music now, after seeing/hearing ""Mamma Mia!""? Well... it's bouncy and sweet, but no way will it displace Dufay or Scarlatti on my iPod. ABBA is musically as corny as their costumes -- a 1970s period piece. Apologies to their fans, and to all Swedes everywhere. Hurray for IKEA! Hurray for ABBA! Sweden needs all the export credits it can get.

And now the movie review! The most artful thing about Mamma Mia is the integration of the songs and chorus-line numbers into the melodrama. Reviewer JP, whose recommendation of this film was responsible for me picking it up, commented on the ""Greek Chorus"" of Greeks serving as a human and musical backdrop for the jet set cast of English speakers. She's right, and it was effective. I'm so far out of touch with Broadway that I thought JP's praise of the music/drama blend sounded just like Bollywood. I've seen a lot of Bollywood films. I urged JP to have a look at Lagaan, one of my favs. Bottom line? Mamma Mia is almost... almost... as artful at squeezing into and out of musical extravaganzas as Bollywood, though the ABBA songs are less appealing. Keep practicing, USA! You'll catch up with India some day.

The story? Mildly amusing, absolutely predictable, jolly enough to keep me watching. Merle Streep looks remarkably like my sister, or vice versa. I get a kick out of the resemblance, and I was delighted to see my 'sister' having so much fun in a role. Streep's enjoyment of her own feeble singing was infectious. I was tickled to watch my usually dour countryman, Stellan Skarsgrd, try to act zany. Zaniness is not intuitive for Swedes. Stellan and I look a lot alike, also, though I'm in better shape. I took a sardonic pleasure in watching him look hopelessly dorky when he danced. At the other extreme, the spark-plug friend of Mamma - I didn't catch her name, the tall one who can really sing and dance - is obviously a real Broadway-ite, and carried the film at times when others were looking vague about their blocking. The young'uns were cast for their looks, and look they did. Some credit has to go to the Greek Islands for the exuberance of the film also; I've spent time on Mykonos, Skiathos, Santorini, etc., and my own nostalgia for those times mixed into the characters of the three middle-aged guys who 'came back wishing they'd never left.' Too bad, now that I think of it, that there wasn't any Greek music at this Greek wedding!

In an age where good comedies get no awards, where musicals are picked apart and lambasted for not 'making sense' (as if any instance of people singing and dancing spontaneously would EVER make logical sense) and only the bleakest of the bleak movies/performances get accolades and award recognition, how can it be wrong to just want to smile, shake your head and enjoy this movie, regardless of the many reasons to not do so?

We all know the major players, but I think Amanda Seyfried (who has also been an standout on television in ""Veronica Mars"" and ""Big House"") should be commended for her acting AND singing ability.  Her sweet rendition of ""I Have a Dream"" was spectacular and her many other interpretations throughout this movie more than made up for any other musical shortcomings.",1230854400,2,1130,4.755102040816326

I work out--at home of course--to the beat of ABBA. It is simply impossible to find music this good, IMO. They say imitation is the best form of flattery, and the music in this movie is good, not great. The acting is another matter: it is great. Meryl has never been better. Can you imagine 007 in a musical? Hilarious. Yes, it is, IMO, more of a romantic comedy than strictly a musical. The story line was fantastically entertaining. Combine that with the nostalga of ABBA music, throw in some premium actors, and you have a hit.

I admit that it seemed silly at times, and I had to laugh at Pierce Brosnan's singing (but what a great, courageous attempt). I don't often look at the director's remarks, but these remarks were highly interesting as to the filming and recording. Did I mention the karoke sing-along complete with words to the songs? Yep, gotta love it.

Last, I admit I was moved to tears with the combo of music, acting, and story line. The young Sophia (Amanda) reminded me of my first love, full of life and zesto. Her singing skills were simply outstanding.

Anyways... the likes of Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan and of course ABBA are the only saving qualities to this movie. It's unfortunate that such a goofy movie needs to be associated with ABBA. I was starting to think that the movie was a tribute to ABBA since they tried to squeeze in as many songs as possible. More song than dialog and character building. Every one was so in love with the character played by Meryl Streep even tho she probably slept around with a million guys and no one knew who the father of the ""daughter getting married"" was. She probably ran out of room in her diary to mention so many guys. Sorry... the premise of this movie is silly, and glorifying it all makes it worse.

Being no fan of that Swedish rock group of the 70s and 80s, I was doubly surprised to find myself enjoying this film so much. In no small measure was my enjoyment thanks to the all-star cast, no doubt, but also how well incorporated the songs were within the story.

The story is worthy of a Shakespearean comedy with high confusion, paternal bonds in question, and lady-love finding its way into the audiences heart in unusual ways. The story, this time, revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D/dp/B000X4O42I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D.</a>) and her desire to find her true father before her wedding.

But Sam (Pierce Brosnan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matador/dp/B000J10KVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matador</a>) arrives with a burning love-gone-by for Donna. And when Donna finds out all three of these old flames have arrived for the wedding, chaos ensues ...mixed with some toe-tapping music (Gah! Toe-tapping to ABBA!).

The other element to the story are two old work friends of Donna's (they were a trio of singers at one time) who arrive for the wedding and find Donna in a frazzled state. Rosie (Julie Walters,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-Jane/dp/B000ZIZ0RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming Jane</a>) is the active and playful one with plenty of spunk, while Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the sexual over-achiever who has to fight off the advances of a few young island boys.

Surprises abound as the movie winds down. One person comes out of the closet, while two others find love (even though one is running away from any possible commitment). Donna herself might find love in the arms of one of those old flames. And Sophie's wedding gets a change of venue.

One of the final songs on the track (""Take a Chance on Me"") is extremely funny and well thought-out. And as the credits roll, there's some laugh-out-loud moments as we get to watch Colin Firth try to dance in a skin-tight, sequined outfit (along with the other main players in the film).

The final positive note for this movie has to be that the director Phyllida Lloyd was also responsible for MAMMA MIA's huge stage production success, and her translation of it from stage to silver screen was exceptionally well-rendered. This one's a surprisingly good film, even for those folks who aren't into ABBA.",1230681600,6,3653,6.296
3614796,4,B001GKJ2DY,"I didn't know Meryl Streep and Pierce Bronson could sing!  That was a nice surprise.

This was a really fun musical with some very zany, unique and creative dances and scenes and plots.  I LOVED the scene of a bunch of guys doing a dance on the dock with flippers.  I laughed many times during this musical and it was such a joyous experience watching it for the first time.  It was also fun to hear the old ABBA songs I haven't heard for years, and loved so much as a kid.

For a musical tho, I was surprised that they didn't cast singers with stronger vocals.  They were passable for sure, but the vocals weren't excellent, which you usually do find in musicals.  But, that also may have added to the quirkiness of this musical.",1230681600,6,730,4.3161764705882355
3614797,5,B001GKJ2DY,"No wonder people are raving over this film!!! It's a musical for sure. It's a comedy--part of the time. It's dramatic--some of the time. And it is entertaining ALL of the time! I laughed! I cried! I cheered! I sang! I love this film--and the best part was Meryl Streep dancing and singing in all parts--whether as part of the story or in her trio.

Everyone was delightful in his/her role. It is true--the singers are not trained professionals--they are more like real people singing in real situations. OK, most people don't blurt out in song, but wouldn't you rather have Meryl sing her own songs than have her lip sync as Audrey Hepburn did in ""My Fair Lady?""

Or to see and hear Pierce Brosnan sing so painfully in his role? His struggle lent credence to his role as a once-heartbroken young man who finds himself 20 years later in a place make amends. His singing was sweet and heartfelt.

Or Julie Waters' show-stopping number toward the end of the film. ""Take a Chance on Me!"" Indeed! Or the concept of the Greek chorus (you get it?!!)--Greek chorus, made up of local villagers in just the right places for the numbers. Especially the women following Meryl/Donna scene.

Mamma Mia--my mamma is known, but who is my dad? Sophie finds her mother's journal the summer she was conceived only to learn that her dad could be one of three men. How this is resolved is one of the great moments of the movie. It's a Greek wedding under the summer sun with a touch of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream of magic and confusion. As in the Bard's play things are set back in order, maybe a new order by movie's end.

To get there the viewer will experience a brouhaha of ABBA melodies (the musical is based on their hits) rousing, funny, and serious. When Meryl/Donna sings to Pierce just before the wedding, my heart broke with hers. Wow, that was as powerful a scene as anything she's done dramatically in other roles.

But enough. I want to finish watching the Feature Commentary in which Director Phyllida Lloyd explains each scene: where, how, purpose. I must confess that I didn't know outdoor scenes are often shot in studio simulations.

  I have never though been a fan of Meryl Streep....this movie changed my opinion of her as an actress. I wasn't aware until recently that she could sing & was very pleased to see her in this role.
  This is a wonderful ""Feel Good"" movie to be watched again & again.
The music numbers seem to be written around the story instead of the other way. Some of the songs are campy, but that adds to the fun of the movie. Others, like Streep's rendition of ""The Winner Takes It All"" can be heart wrenching. My favorite part of the movie is the scene built around the song ""Voulez Vous""...also the scene with the song ""Slipping Through My Fingers.""

Are there better singers in the world? Yeah, maybe. Are there better actors for this show? Likely not. Meryl Streep is simply wonderful, she carries the character of Donna just wonderfully. Watching Amanda Seyfried make the transition from ""Mean Girls"" to Sophie here is entrancing, and her singing is inspiring.

Christine Baranski is simply hysterical in everything she is in and Mamma Mia! is no exception!

High point? Meryl Streep singing ""The Winner Takes It All,"" how she manages to make it such a powerful performance without being ABBA is simply a testament to her ability as an actress. Buy it. Enjoy it. And watch it again and again and again.",1230508800,,897,4.927152317880795
3614802,5,B001GKJ2DY,"After seeing the movie when it first came out, I was dying to get the DVD to find out why they made changes to the stage version. The commentary from director Phyllida Lloyd is extremely insightful and explains why they had to remove ""The Name of the Game"" and shortened some of the songs (though I wish they would have kept it in and shortened the ""When All Is Said And Done"" wedding reception number!). Surprisingly, none of the male actors were hired with knowledge that they could sing - so they were all nervous of the challenge of singing and dancing at the same time. I wish they had done a second commentary with the cast, but then they probably wouldn't have been able to release this before Christmas.

There aren't too many deleted scenes (mainly of the 3 guys at the beginning reading letters), or many outtakes (the Making of video has more outtakes), but overall the 2nd DVD is well worth having in your library. Buy the 2 disc version and you won't be disappointed!!!",1230508800,,982,4.51685393258427

Okay, it wasn't the worse film I've seen, but it definitely ranks as one of the worst vocally presented musicals ever. Ever. Outside of the wonderfully talented young voice of Amanda Seyfried, I haven't heard singing this bad on film since Jack Nicholson in Tommy or George Burns in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Even though Meryl Streep should be given the ""Best Try"" award for looking like she was having a good time while not showing embarrassment, ""singers"" like Pierce Brosnan sound like they were soulless barking dogs and needed to be put out of their misery. Sure, visually the movie is a fun romp, but if I hear Meryl either sigh, cry, or moan during each song again, I swear I'm gonna buy me a chalkboard and scratch away. I find it hard to believe the Broadway play it's based on is so huge, but then again it's based on music that helped define a generation...just not mine. Heed this warning: unless you are a bonafide ABBA fanatic or simply ""ghey"" for musicals, do yourself a favor and rent Across The Universe again than to put yourself through this. GACK!

It made me want to get up off the couch and dance and sing along.

The scenery was absolutely gorgeous. The costuming was appropriate, the acting superb. (What's not to like about Meryl Streep?) The Abba music was wonderful and the singing was...well, they sing like the rest of us, and there was a certain charm to that.

3614810,4,B001GKJ2DY,"""Mamma Mia! The Movie""  is based on the long-running Broadway play.  Its thin plot was conceived to tie together a catalogue of ABBA songs.  Donna (Meryl Streep) is an independent, single mother who owns a small hotel on a picture-perfect Greek island.  Her daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), is about to be married and Donna has invited to the wedding two lifelong friends from her one-time singing group, Donna and the Dynamos -- multi-divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski) and practical, no-nonsense Rosie (Julie Walters).  Sophie has secretly invited three guests of her own.  Longing to discover the identity of her father so he can walk her down the aisle, she brings back three men from Donna's past to the Mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier -- Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam (Pierce Brosnan), and Harry (Colin Firth).
 Streep's Donna is far afield from any role the actress has played before.  It's light, almost buoyant, as Donna sings her heart out, dances on a pier, or looks mortified when she meets her three beaus from decades past.  The songs by ABBA include ""Dancing Queen,"" ""S.O.S.,"" ""Take a Chance on Me,"" and ""Money, Money, Money.""  When you finish watching the film, the songs will remain in your head for hours, if not days.  You'll have to decide if that's a good or a bad thing.  Both Baranski, with her trademark deadpan delivery, and Walters, with take-no-prisoners energy, provide ample comic relief.  The two-disc Special Edition contains a making-of documentary, a detailed featurette on the staging of one musical number (""Lay All Your Love On Me""), a music video, deleted scenes and outtakes, and a digital copy of the movie.",1230422400,3,1671,5.032727272727273

What's new is seeing Meryl Streep unwind and let it all fly -- singing, dancing, acting -- well, we all knew she could act with the best, but who knew she could sing and dance as well? A great team of supporting actors and actresses, all of whom could sing (Pierce Brosnan excepted). Actually, I enjoyed Brosnan's performances, including his singing. Sometimes a little less polish and a little more realism carries the day. Brosnan could always deliver a line, and he has some key ones in this movie. I thought the big production numbers were very entertaining. I even enjoyed the plot line, although there were some cruel twists at the end. I won't spoil the movie by revealing the twists I didn't like, but they soured me enough to knock off what would otherwise have been a five star rating.

As usual, it is best to ignore the professional movie critics. Something happens when you take money for your movie reviews, and it is not good. My wife and I enjoyed this fine, entertaining movie. I thought most of the cinematography was very good to excellent. The scene that a lot of people seem to be complaining about features a pretty amazing performance by Meryl Streep. That was captivating enough to draw my attention away from some supposed faults in the cinematography. Oh well, too busy enjoying the movie to be hypercritical.

I adore Meryl Streep but she is not that talented when it comes to singing. Pierce Brosnan is so atrocious that I had to fast-forward his numbers.

I won't belabor what other reviewers have said so well; but, for my own two cents, the thing that most destroys this piece is CASTING.  Meryl Streep is insane beyond belief as the mother of the bride.  Grandmother, maybe; she looks so old in this film that her very first appearance on screen ruins everything before and after.  Streep's face looks like a leather glove with two slits for eyes; apparently, too much cosmetic surgery has tightened her skin until it has pulled her eyes back into small slots.  I became a slightly nauseous at having to look at that face on-screen over the course of the film.
Streep's ancient look made everything else absurd- her former lovers look like her children in comparison, and from the apparent age of her ""daughter"" in the film, her character would have had to have given birth in her mid-70's.
I am with many other reviewers who marvel at how writers and directors can take top notch actors, music, and scenery and throw it all away, creating a horrific and, if there is any mercy in the world, a quickly forgettable moment in cinema madness.",1230163200,11,1160,4.694581280788177

The film adaptation of the smash&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia-The-Musical-Based-on-the-Songs-of-ABBA/dp/B000031WEN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia! The Musical Based on the Songs of ABBA,</a>&nbsp;has a lot going for it. The least of which is the immensely likable songs of ABBA, which anchor the movie with familiarity. The scenery is gorgeous and the cast is packed with exuberance and cheer. Then again, at 59, Meryll Streep steals the film with her presence as the former girl-group singer retired to an island resort. Packed with good cheer, great music and eye catching dance numbers, ""Mamma Mia"" is as frothy and glittery as the foam riding the tops of an island wave. But it's also just about as substantial.

As Donna, Streep just shimmers. Her gal-pals Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Waters) each have scene stealing moments. When Tanya lets loose on a flirtatious younger man with ""Does Your Mother Know,"" it's one of the funniest bits in the movie. As Sophie, Amanda Seyfried carries her songs probably better than anyone here. Even as she is the focal point of ""Mamma Mia,"" the story is ultimately Streep's. It is Donna's crisis of parenthood (the flimsy set-up where Sophie invites her three probable fathers to her wedding) that forms the crux of the movie. The musical numbers spin off in all direction, not always conducive to the plot.

Be that as it may, we watched the ""sing-along"" version of the film is great fun, and Streep's version of ""The Winner Takes It All"" is a show-stopper. I also defy you not to sing along to either ""Dancing Queen"" or ""Waterloo"" (done as a campy finale with the principals in ABBA period costumes). Also noted, none of the male leads can sing worth a lick, although the story that Brosnan didn't know he was being cast in a musical is pretty funny (he was approached with the offer to play a male lead in a movie with Meryll Streep, then was told what the movie was AFTER he accepted). But if you accept ""Mamma Mia"" for what it is, a big hunk of feel-good fun, you won't come away disappointed.

Now where is that Movie adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Will-Rock-You/dp/B00009ILC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Will Rock You</a>?",1229990400,2,2337,5.359673024523161

The set and backdrop look very plastic and unreal in appearance. It is a ""Grease"" wannabe that falls flat on its face. Can't believe all the good reviews.",1229904000,7,397,4.527777777777778

Can't wait to see it again. Those bum reviews in my opinion are just those poor souls that have no appreciation for a GREAT musical. Fantastic flow and story is magical. Great work to all involved.

I could have picked random people off of the street, had them write their own tunes, and film it on a camcorder, and I swear that it would have been more interesting than this unbelievably horrifying excuse for a film.

3614837,4,B001GKJ2DY,"For the sake of avoiding hyperbole I'll try not to say this is one of the most enjoyable musical romantic comedies I have ever seen. But I will say that it is an absolute joy to spend an hour forty minutes watching actors appearing as though they are enjoying themselves. And in Mamma Mia, every actor seems to be - well, to quote one of the songs - having the time of their lives. It's a sitcom storyline; the young bride played by Amanda Seyfried secretly invites her three possible biological fathers to her wedding and, as the saying goes, hilarity ensues. A superb cast is in attendance - though Seyfried's Sophie the central character, Meryl Streep gets top billing, and delivers a landmark performance befitting her status as one of the greatest contemporary actresses. So much for avoiding hyperbole, huh? She looks slim, happy, and beautiful. Also along for this fun ride are Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Christine Baranski, and one of my personal favorite actresses, Julie Walters, who is perhaps best known as Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter films, but I have also loved her in Billy Elliot and Educating Rita. The backdrop for all this fun is a seemingly timeless inn on a beautiful Greek island. All of the musical numbers are songs from the 70s Swedish vocal pop band ABBA. But wait. They are integrated beautifully into the story and Meryl Streep in particular shows a shocking capacity for acting through rages of emotion, in character while singing. And did I say it strongly enough? The absolute joy the actors seem to be having is infectious. You can't watch this movie while frowning. I don't care who you are, it will put a smile on your face. I watched the DVD from Netflix, and gave it 4 out of possible 5 stars in Netflix's rating system. Now I am going to buy it.  After I have watched it two or three more times I just might give it the full five stars that I usually reserve for Schindler's List league films. The DVD special features include an additional song that was deleted from the final edit, director comments, and a sing-along mode in which the lyrics are displayed during songs in karaoke fashion. The DVD was released December 16th in North America and November 27th in Europe. I recommend everyone give it a spin.",1229817600,7,2273,4.668329177057356
3614838,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I just HAD to add my two cents worth to counter those one-star naysayers.  I never did enjoy a musical on the silver screen until I saw 'Mamma Mia'.  I actually went to see this movie for one thing and one thing only -- the MEN (well, two in particular: Brosnan and Firth).  I walked out of the movie theatre smiling, my 13-year-old daughter and I gushing about how awesome it was.  Yes, it's true, Brosnan can't sing but Firth has a decent enough voice (though he only did one number).  Streep, too, has a surprisingly good pair of lungs; her girl friends made for a strong supporting cast, both in the acting and the singing.  To those who don't think this movie is realistic, simple arithmatic will tell you that a 20-year-old girl in the 00s was NOT born of a relationship in the 70s!  So who cares?  It's just a fun movie -- watch it, enjoy it and stop mulling over every little detail!  I don't think the guys would enjoy this movie as much but, hey, we sit through enough shoot-'em-ups with them that they can watch this with us!  Ultimately, there will be two camps: the people (women) who loved the movie and those (men) who hated it.

About this Two-Disc Special Edition, I'm not sure what the other disc is since I bought the Full Screen edition.  The Full Screen edition was bare-bone basic consisting of only the disc itself and no inserts whatsoever so that was disappointing.  Maybe the Two-Disc edition will offer more (but it's good only if you have a WS telly).",1229817600,4,1479,4.433333333333334
3614839,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I'm surprised at the negative reviews on this film; there must be a lot of curmudgeons out there.  First of all, most people who went to see Mamma Mia love ABBA and all their songs.  Obviously no one can sing these songs even half as well as ABBA did, but so what?  Bjorn and Benny's music is so wonderful it stands on its own no matter who sings it.  This film is fun, the gorgeous Greek setting makes it pure eye candy, the songs no matter how ""imperfectly"" they were sung are still infectious and make you want to jump out of your seat and dance, and you will sing along with most of them.  This movie does exceedingly well what it is supposed to do:  entertain.  As for the ABBA music, I probably wouldn't buy this soundtrack and rather, I would buy the original ABBA music if I wanted a CD of the songs on this film.",1229817600,2,821,4.158227848101266
3614840,3,B001GKJ2DY,"This was a great fun inspirational film.  Innocent and charming (well, with some small sexual innuendos).  But, here's how I see that some people will be divided on its overall appeal:

For people who've heard of ABBA and may know a couple of their songs, this film will definitely make you wanna run out and buy some ABBA CD's.  For those of us (like me) who already have all of ABBA's CD's and have cherished ABBA all their life, these actors singing ABBA songs is rather dull and much less energetically expressive than the ever-vivacious vocal outbursts of Annafrid and Agnetha (the original girls of ABBA).

The original songs from ABBA have incredibly talented harmonizing and enthusiasm.  None of these actors can hit the notes like Agnetha and Annafrid (also known as Frida) did in their day.  And especially Pierce Brosnan. This was an embarrassing transition from being a former James Bond.

However, I'm glad to see a movie made as a musical to many of ABBA's fabulous songs.  Pick up ABBA's greatest hits on CD, or just go ahead and get all eight of their original albums.  You will be in for a treat!

Let me give you one good example of the girls of ABBA belting their voices out so strong.  Go to YouTube and listen to ABBA's version of ""Chiquitita"", and concentrate of the voices and the fabulous background orchestration.  It is one of the greatest songs they've done which is a great example of their enormous talent.  ABBA will never be topped.",1229817600,3,1463,4.6640625
3614841,3,B001GKJ2DY,"""Mamma Mia!"" brings the wildly successful ABBA-inspired stage musical to the screen with a cast of actors who don't usually sing or dance. The film retains the behind-the-scenes talent from the stage show: director Phydilla Lloyd, producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and score by former ABBA member Benny Andersson. It adds one song and leaves a few others out, but this is very much a transfer of the stage musical to the screen. A young woman named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) plans to marry her beau Sky (Dominic Cooper) and dreams that her father will be at her wedding to give her away. But Sophie doesn't know who her father is. Twenty years ago, her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had summer flings with three men. Sophie invites all three to her wedding in Greece in hopes that she will recognize her father. But when Donna sees the men from her past, she's sure that they will ruin the wedding.

There's hardly any point in mentioning that the set-up for this musical romp in the Greek Isles is silly beyond words. But the three candidates for Sophie's paternity are appealing guys, and the actors are game: American architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth), and Swedish adventurer and travel writer Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard). The men are counterbalanced by a trio of sprightly middle-aged ladies: Donna and her friends Rosie the author (Julie Walters) and Tanya the serial divorcee (Christine Barnasky). These are fun characters, and I enjoyed them. I wish I could say the same for the younger set. Amanda Seyfried has a nice enough voice, but Sophie is annoying and seems more like a 13-year-old than a woman of 20.

The musical numbers are dull. I partly blame the lack of vigor on the locations. This is a jukebox musical, so the songs are not integrated into the plot as seamlessly as they would be if the music had been written for the stage. And since this is a movie, filmed on location in Greece, they don't have the benefit of an intimate venue. On stage in a small venue, energy would be flying off the stage. In these wide open locations, further muted by transfer to the screen, the musical numbers fall flat. I kept hoping that the next scene would not be musical, because the stuff in between was reasonably charming. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that most of the principle cast is over 50. Generally an appealing cast, even if they are not the best-suited talent for a musical, but unfortunately, the music that's supposed to be the selling point is the film's weakness.

The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition has the option of viewing a Sing-a-Long version in which the lyrics to the songs are displayed across the screen during musical numbers. There is one deleted musical number called ""The Name of the Game"" (3 min). And there is a feature commentary by director Phyllida Lloyd. She talks about locations, some photographic techniques, characters, cast, filming, her approach to the musical numbers, and various technical details. Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.",1229817600,2,3148,4.891385767790262

Meryl Streep is phenomenal in her role as the single mother who runs a hotel on a Greek island.  This movie is worth seeing just for the beautiful scenes of the islands...But the performances of Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski turns this into a fabulous song fest.

Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are hilarious as contenders for ""father"", along with Stellan Skarsgard.

While the story may seem trite -- love wins out, etc. -- the gorgeous ABBA tunes sweep across the beautiful settings, creating a crescendo of glory as the characters bask in the beauty of life and nature.  What more could one want?

Yes, I agree that the movie does not compare despite the scenery, wonderful actors and fantastic story line, but I have watched the dvd 3 times in the 2 days since it arrived.  That says something. You can't help but love the music and sing along, with or without the available subtitles. The songs did not flow as easily as they did in the play because I did not feel like the actors were in sync with the music in spots but they did a great job at something quite foreign to most of them and it was wonderful none the less.  I highly recommend this to Abba lovers and musical lovers of all ages.  I bought the 2 dvd set and the extras I have seen so far were well worth the extra few dollars.

3614848,4,B001GKJ2DY,"Sophie has been raised on a remote Greek island by her mother Donna (Meryl Streep).  Donna has never told Sophie who her father is, and that has left a hole in Sophie's heart.

But as her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper) nears, Sophie finds a journal her mother kept 21 years ago.  In it, she finds three potential candidate for her father, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard).  Convinced that she will know her father on sight, she invites all three men without telling her mother.  But when all three men arrive, Sophie finds herself just as confused as she was before.  And their presence just complicates the wedding plans even further.  Will Donna recover from the surprise?  Will Sophie figure out who her father is?  Will the men discover why they are there?  And just how many great songs can be used to capture the feelings of the characters?

I was not familiar with ABBA before I saw the movie, so pretty much had no clue what to expect.  And I loved these songs.  Honestly, if I didn't know where the music originated, I would have told you all the songs were written for the musical.  Not bad for a concept I dismissed as silly a few years back.  But these pop/rock sounds fit the story perfectly.

And this cast can sing!  Meryl Streep is especially impressive as Donna, and gets the most songs.  The emotion she gets into so many of the songs is outstanding but hardly surprising considering how great an actress she is.  The only weak link in the singing department was Pierce Brosnan.  He is adequate while the others are outstanding.  But that's a minor point.

With the number of songs in the movie, there is no way that they can develop all the characters well, especially since the film is under two hours.  Donna and her two friends are the best developed, followed by Sophie.  Honestly, I was disappointed with how little development Sky got.  I thought he'd play a bigger role.  And I had a hard time keeping the back story on the three potential dads straight.

But I was certainly pulled into the story, wanting to know how things would end.  I felt the climax was rushed to make way for one more song, the only time I felt that way about the story.

3614849,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Mamma Mia! is a stage musical with a book by British playwright Catherine Johnson, based on the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Andersson and Bjrn Ulvaeus. It is an example of a jukebox musical, and is notable for popularizing the genre. A common misconception is that the plot is adapted from the 1968 film Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell starring Gina Lollobrigida. (In that film the mother is a former prostitute who told all three men that they were the father to secure payment for her child's upkeep. This differs vastly from the Mamma Mia story. Donna is not based on a prostitute and the writers deny any knowledge of the 1968 film, any similarity is coincidental.)

Although the title of the musical is taken from the group's 1975 chart-topper Mamma Mia, the plot is fictional, not biographical.

Bjrn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, who composed the original music for ABBA, were involved in the development of the show from the beginning. Anni-Frid Lyngstad has been involved financially in the production, while Agnetha Fltskog has not, though she was present at the Swedish premiere and final show.

The musical includes such hits as ""Super Trouper"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"", ""Thank You for the Music"", ""Money, Money, Money"", ""The Winner Takes It All"", ""Voulez Vous"", ""I Have a Dream"" and ""SOS"". It had been seen by over ten million people worldwide as of July 2003.[1] Estimates of 2007, is that 30 million have now seen Mamma Mia!. Since its opening in 1999, the production has grossed US$2.0 billion in earnings. [2]

A stage-to-film adaptation, Mamma Mia! The Movie, starring Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, premiered in July 2008Mamma Mia! The Movie is a 2008 Golden Globe-nominated stage-to-film adaptation of the 1999 West End musical of the same name, based on the songs of successful pop group ABBA, with additional music also composed by ABBA member Benny Andersson. The film did very well at the box office becoming the most successful Hollywood film musical of all time and the highest grossing film of all time in the United Kingdom.[2] Like the stage musical, the film's title originates from the group's 1975 chart-topper Mamma Mia. It was produced by Universal Pictures in partnership with Playtone and Littlestar.[3]

Meryl Streep heads the cast of the film, playing the role of single mother Donna Sheridan. Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgrd play the three possible fathers to Donna's daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried).

On August 29, 2008, Mamma Mia!: The Sing-Along Edition, with lyrics to the songs highlighted on the screen, was released in select theaters.[4]

On December 15, 2008, it was announced that Mamma Mia! had become the highest grossing film in Britain of all time. The previous record was held by Titanic in 1998. The film takes place on the enchanting Greek island of Skopelos (Kalokairi). The story begins at the remote Aegean island hotel, Villa Donna, run by Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), and Sophie's fiance Sky (Dominic Cooper).

Prior to her forthcoming marriage, Sophie nervously posts three wedding invitations (""I Have a Dream"") to three different men, one of whom she believes may be her father. From three cities across the globe, three men set off to return to the island, and the woman that had enchanted each of them 20 years earlier.

Back on that island, Donna is rousing her staff for the frenetic day ahead as Sophie's bridesmaids and best friends Ali and Lisa (Ashley Lilley and Rachel McDowall) arrive and she shares with her best mates a scandalous secret: Sophie has found her mother's diary and learned she has three possible dads; American businessman Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Swedish adventurer Bill Austin (Stellan Skarsgard), and British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth). Without telling her mother, she has invited all three to her wedding (""Honey, Honey""), believing that after she spends time with them, she will at last know who her real father is.

Meanwhile, back on the Greek mainland, Sam, Bill, and Harry; strangers until today have met at the harbor. Fortuitously, Sam and Harry have missed the ferry to Skopelos (Kalokairi), and Bill offers them a lift on his yacht to reconnect with the woman who broke all their hearts 20 years ago.

Back on Skopelos, Donna is ecstatic to reunite with old friends and former ""Donna and The Dynamos"" bandmates, wisecracking author Rosie (Julie Walters) and wealthy multiple divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski), and reveals her mystification at her daughter's desire for a traditional wedding or any wedding at all. At the Villa, Sophie introduces Tanya and Rosie to true love Sky, and tells them about their idea of designing a website to attract tourists to the island. Donna explains her precarious finances (""Money, Money, Money"") to her girlfriends as she takes them on a tour of the Villa. Hounded by her creditors, Donna dreams of a ""rich man's world,"" sunbathing on a yacht and being deliciously pampered. She is brought back to reality as an ominous crack appears in the courtyard.

The three men arrive, and Sophie smuggles them to their quarters and sheepishly explains that she, not her mother, sent the invitations. She begs the men to hide so Donna will have a fantastic surprise at the wedding; seeing the old friends of whom she ""so often"" favorably speaks. They overhear Donna working (humming ""Fernando"" to herself) in the storeroom below preparing to fix the crack and the men swear to Sophie they will not reveal her secret. Sophie leaves by the window just in the nick of time, as Donna peeps through the trapdoor.

She is dumbfounded to find herself face to face with the three former lovers she could never forget (""Mamma Mia!""), while the men clumsily make up excuses for their presence. Donna is adamant; they simply cannot stay. Visibly shaken, she confides in Tanya and Rosie (""Chiquitita"") a secret she has kept from everyone - she is uncertain which of the three men is actually Sophie's father. No matter, as Tanya and Rosie rally her spirits by getting Donna to join in with the female staff and islanders accompanying a musical number intended to make her forget her woes. Donna and The Dynamos reclaim their glory days and champion the women of the island in a call to liberation (""Dancing Queen"").

Sophie finds the men aboard Bill's yacht, and they take a trip around the gorgeous island of Skopelos (""Our Last Summer"") and tell her stories of Donna as a carefree girl. Upon their return, Sophie musters up the courage to speak with Sky about her ploy, but loses her nerve. Sky and Sophie sing passionately to each other (""Lay All Your Love on Me""), but are interrupted by the bachelor party that has descended upon Sky to kidnap him for his last night of freedom.

At Sophie's bachelorette party, Donna, Tanya, and Rosie perform in a surprise one-night-only event as Donna and The Dynamos (""Super Trouper""). Sophie is delighted to see her mother rock out, but becomes nervous when the festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Sam, Bill and Harry. She decides to get each of her three prospective dads alone to talk.

The young bride uses the confusion of her amorous girlfriends' dancing with the men (""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"") to speak with Sam about his love for Donna. Next, she's on to Harry about his desire, if any, for children. Finally, Bill reveals that the old woman who gave Donna the money to invest in her Villa was his Great Aunt Sofia, and Sophie guesses she must be her namesake. That's it! Bill must be her father! Sophie asks him to give her away and to keep their secret from Donna until the wedding

Over the moon, Sophie returns to the party. But her happiness is short-lived as Sam and Harry each tell her they must be her dad and will give her away (""Voulez-Vous""). A shocked Sophie can't tell them the truth and, overwhelmed by the consequences of her action, faints on the dance floor.

In the morning, Rosie and Tanya reassure a frantic Donna they will take care of the men. Donna confronts Sophie in the courtyard, mistakenly believing Sophie wants the wedding stopped. Sophie angrily says that all she wants is to avoid her mother's mistakes and storms off. An upset Donna is accosted by Sam, full of fatherly concern at Sophie getting married so young. Donna dresses him down, and both realize they still have feelings for each other (""SOS"").

Meanwhile, on Bill's boat, Bill and Harry are about to confide in each other, but are interrupted by Rosie who is startled to find Bill, naked, making breakfast. Similarly, pulses are racing down on the sandy beaches as Tanya and young Pepper (Philip Michael) continue their May-December flirtations from the previous night (""Does Your Mother Know"").

With her plans falling apart and wedding in jeopardy, Sophie knows it is time to come clean to Sky and ask for his help. He reacts angrily to his fiance's deception and Sophie must turn to her mother for support.

As Donna helps her daughter dress for their wedding, the rift is quickly healed and Donna reminisces about Sophie's childhood and how quickly she's grown (""Slipping Through My Fingers""). Then and there, Sophie decides the only parent she's ever known is the only one who should give her away. As the staff and bridesmaids accompany Donna and Sophie to the chapel, Sam lies in nervous wait. Donna waves the wedding party on, and he begs Donna to talk. She cuts him short, however, revealing the deep pain she felt over losing him (""The Winner Takes It All"").

After the ceremony begins, Donna can hold her tongue no more. She confesses to Sophie that her father is present but he could be Sam, Bill, or Harry. Sophie, in a shocker of her own, admits she invited them. The three men concur that they would be quite happy to be one-third of a father for such a girl. The surprises keep coming when Sophie tells Sky they should postpone their wedding and travel the world, as they have always wanted. It appears that preparations have been in vain until Sam steps in with the final curveball: he proposes to Donna.

She accepts (""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do""); Sam and Donna then go through an impromptu ceremony, surrounded by the churchful of guests.

At the wedding reception, Sam sings to Donna, whom he has loved for 21 years (""When All Is Said and Done"" [in the film only, not the musical]), which prompts Rosie to make a coy play for Bill (""Take a Chance on Me""). All the couples present proclaim their love and, magically, water from Aphrodite's fountain of love bursts through the crack in the courtyard at Villa Donna (""Mamma Mia!"").

The story concludes as Sophie and Sky bid farewell to Skopelos island and sail away to a new life together (""I Have a Dream""), one full of hope and promise.

Donna, Tanya, and Rosie reprise ""Dancing Queen"" during the first part of the credits, then launch into ""Waterloo"" with the rest of the cast. Finally, Amanda Seyfried sings ""Thank You for the Music"".",1229644800,3,11062,4.848966613672496

3614852,3,B001GKJ2DY,"I like musicals.  There I've said it.  Someone will surely come by and take my 'man' card for having said so, but I don't care.  I'm man enough to admit that I actually enjoy musicals.  At least in most cases I do.  With Mamma Mia!, at least the movie version (as found on Blu-ray and DVD), well, not so much.

Mamma Mia! has been 'a worldwide phenomenon' for as long as I can remember... going back to TV ads blaring for the broadway type show.  Not quite as far back as the days when the band that the music came from was making music, but still for quite a long time.  Inspired by the music of ABBA (sorry, I can't make the backwards B character there), Mamma Mia! uses many of those songs to provide the sound track and even dialogue for a story about a daughter that is getting married, from a single mother who isn't sure which of 3 men fathered that daughter during a magical year many years ago.

As a story Mamma Mia! is entertaining enough, and the actors in the film actually do well with their roles except.... well, except for the fact that they have to sing and need to be convincing enough to not have viewers feeling that they're watching a bunch of lip syncing.  It is in this area that Mamma Mia! fails for me, thanks to singing that seems out of sync with the songs that I remember, and worse, thanks to singing from an actor or two that were cast in the film who frankly shouldn't be allowed to sing at all.

As a singer, lets just say that Pierce Brosnan shouldn't consider changing his line of work.  It may not be totally horrible, but it's enough to make you wish that Brosnan was busy working on a Bond film or something similar.

Meryl Streep does ok with her vocal stylings, but again the pace of some of the singing she does just seems completely off when compared to the radio played songs that they were taken from.

Watch this if you feel inspired to, but think carefully before purchase.  For as much 'fun' as this is supposed to be, you may find yourself regretting a purchase and wishing you rented instead.",1229558400,3,2041,4.306282722513089

To see Mamma Mia! Of course.

What well heeled, high class poultry wouldn't want to see Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth belt out ABBA standards amidst the Greek Isles?  Sure, they aren't all recording stars, and Brosnan can scarcely carry a tune, but the premise of the film/musical is delightful.  Getting married?  Look for your Dad, or dads in the case of Sophia.  I think the best part of the film is probably Sophia standing in the church screaming that she doesn't care how many men she slept with while the 'dads' scramble and the priest looks on.  This could have been a Jane Austen ending with two weddings, but it's not!

The music is wonderful, and the acting is almost clumsy.  But with the film set up, it can't help it.  Men in uncomfortable situations do stupid things.  Women fighting love do the same.  Cinematography?  The weak point, but when you watch this film, the scenery is stunning!

Highly recommended.  Abba will sell 10,000,000 more albums this year.

The cinematography is great, the choreography is good, the girls are gorgeous, Pierce Brosnan's singing is painful but that's part of the fun.

The good thing was the theater wasn't that full and so I hope no one heard me much singing along.  I did hear others laugh their heads off and sing too.

So one day I was ""convinced"" to sit down and watch this film. And, because even manly men can channel their more refined dimensions (and without forfeiting their man card), I ended up digging MAMMA MIA and, dammit, even humming some of these Abba songs!

The set-up goes like this: It's just before Sophie's wedding, and preparations are lively. But there's just one thing missing to make it all perfect: her father to give her away. All her life, Sophie had gone on, not knowing who her dad is. But then she stumbles upon her mother Donna's diary and discovers that her dad could be one of three possible men. All with whom, the diary states, her mother had spent time, with one thing leading to another, and dot dot dot... Unbeknownst to Donna, Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. And, then, fun shenanigans.

For those who've signed up for FeelGoodology 101, know that the first thing the professor does in class is pop in this DVD. Say what you will about MAMMA MIA, kibitz about the campy elements or grouse that some or most of the cast can't carry a tune, but that doesn't alter the fact that this musical simply makes you feel good. I've never seen Meryl Streep in a role like this, which just goes to show that the woman can officially do anything in the acting gig. Pierce Brosnan, no, he can't sing, but so what? He, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard come in with good humor and grace. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is so damn engaging and so hopefully wistful that she's the perfect choice to open the movie with, because her plight immediately draws you into the story. And she can sing. Her vibrant rendition of ""Honey Honey"" is an exercise in exuberance and catchiness. It may be my favorite song, up there with ""Chiqitita,"" ""Take a Chance on Me"" and ""Dancing Queen,"" this last one to which I, thankfully, managed to abstain from humming along (for I am a manly man and not some disco dude).

There's not much here that's rooted in reality, and it's fine. Every now and then, this type of film is exactly what I'm looking for, especially when one's down in the dumps. MAMMA MIA is a fable, full of warmth and great energy and vivid colors. It's set on a stunning Greek island and boasts its very own spirited Greek chorus, which does just fine going into backup singers mode. You get the happy ending that was never in doubt. And, instead of one Prince Charming, the movie presents three.

What I've got is the single disc DVD. Its special features include lukewarm audio commentary by Director Phyllida Lloyd (who also directed the stage productions of MAMMA MIA) and the deleted musical number ""The Name of the Game."" And, ooooh, there's an option to play the movie with on-screen lyrics for the musical numbers! And an option to skip right to a song. Score, baby!

Okay. And now I'm gonna watch some football (please don't take away my man card).",1229299200,18,2989,4.558659217877095
3614867,3,B001GKJ2DY,"Mama Mia! Not That Bad, Actually

By Kristin Battestella

When I had the opportunity to see Mama Mia! in theaters, I was a little reluctant to go. Despite being a big Bee Gees fan, I don't care for Abba all that much, and I'm not into newer musical chick flicks. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, I kind of liked Mama Mia!.

As young Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) readies for her marriage to Sky (Dominic Cooper) on the Greek island of Skopelos, she confesses to her best friends Ali (Ashley Lilly) and Lisa (Rachel McDowall) that she's invited her three prospective fathers to the wedding- unbeknownst to her mother Donna (Meryl Streep). Donna's friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters) come for the festivities and help Donna relive her glory days when she discovers her previous lovers are close at hand. Who is Sophie's Dad? Rogue Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), uptight Harry (Colin Firth), or divorcee Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?

Each major cast member gets a lead turn at the music. Tony winner Christine Baranski (Chicago, Cybill) and Julie Walters (Harry Potter) could steal the show with `Does Your Mother Know' and `Take A chance on Me', respectively, if it were not for Streep's taking down the house with `The Winner Takes It All'. I knew the 14 time Oscar nominee (twice a winner with Kramer vs Kramer and Sophie's Choice) could carry a tune, but I didn't know she could sing that well. Everything the 59 year old actress has is in Donna, vocally and physically. Much was made of the impromptu split for the movie's trailers, but Streep's energy throughout the film's big dance numbers makes me envious. If it weren't for all her other star turns, I could say that this is a definitive and star making role. Streep will most likely get another nomination for Mama Mia!; despite all her dramatic and even comedic achievement, this is the complete variety package.

Seyfried (Mean Girls, Veronica Mars) is cute as daughter Sophie. She's pretty, but not in a conventional way, and of course, she can sing. I'm glad, however, that the core of the film is on Donna, not necessarily Sophie's oft seen coming of age quest for her father. I'm not a Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice) or Stellan Skarsgard (Pirates of the Caribbean) fan, but both fit their parts here with humor and acceptable tunes. Only Pierce Brosnan (Die Another Day) is out of place. Pierce, Pierce-if this were a straight romantic drama or comedy, he would be to die for as the days of Remington Steele. I like Brosnan a lot, which is why I can watch Mama Mia! and forgive the fact that he can't sing. Not like I can sing myself, but it's easy to pick Brosnan for last place among the cast here. Sorry!

At the same time, I discovered Abba music I didn't know was Abba and music that I'd never heard before. Mama Mia! gives us the obligatory `Dancing Queen' and the eponymous track-which was stuck in my head for days after. The sound is done well, even if background singers spring up out of nowhere. It's a musical, you can take a leap of faith when people break out in song. Mama Mia! does gives us a few obvious onscreen music set ups, but for the most part the songs are fun and lighthearted. I didn't how they would work one of the few songs I knew in there, but `Fernando' has its moment. `Money, Money, Money' and `Super Trouper' aren't as upbeat, but the low songs are forgivable when considering the desire to fit every Abba song possible in one under two hour movie.

While the dated and hokey nature of seventies styles are now accepted and even hip-we wouldn't be having a musical comprised of Abba's songs if they weren't-it is in fact Mama Mia's contemporary stylings that may hinder its long lasting appeal. The shabby chic look of Donna's villa, the dress of the three males leads, and the all too pretty beachy and bohemian look of Sophie and Sky trap this film in 2008. Sure maybe people copied Clueless for back to school 1995, but come 96, not so much. Mama Mia! does win production values for its great Greek locales. The crystal waters, swift boats, impressive rocks and cliffs blend perfectly with the indoor soundstages. I don't want to say `It's all Greek to me', but there were times when this Italian was out of the loop on the Greek marriage customs. I do wonder how the heck everyone climbed all those steps to that church though. Oiy.

Although the script from relative newcomer Catherine Johnson is thin in some places and too obvious in others-like the obligatory father bonding montages and near blatant cues for the music-the elder cast keeps things sardonic or witty where it needs to be. Where I'm sure some actors are embarrassed by musical attempts, I don't think the cast here has anything to be ashamed of-even Brosnan! While there is definitely a hard core group of fans racking up the pre sales for this DVD release (it looks like the two disc edition has all the features) it's the music and the talent that makes Mama Mia! a successful transition from stage to screen. Instead of wallowing in Beach Bingo teeny drama, stage director Phyllida Lloyd keeps the mature members of the cast on top. Even though Lloyd lets the pace drag in between musical numbers, its rare to find a musical with adult fun and maturity that's PG-13 enough for the whole family.

I don't think guys will care for Mama Mia!. Macho men might cringe at a wife or daughter's obsession with this film. Those Abba songs over and over! Young guys, however, might like the music or the hot dancing. There's nothing super naughty for tweens and younger-what there is might go over their heads, so Mama Mia! might be a parent's chance to swap out High School Musical for something they can enjoy, too. For surprising musical fun for the whole family, pick up Mama Mia! on DVD this December.",1229299200,3,5781,4.6376953125

It passes those horrible supposed greatest movies of all time like Gone with the Wind and Wizard of Oz. Those movies were predictable. Best musical I've ever seen!!!!! Lets start off with the music. Though Abba was a great band in the 70's, this movie did not ruin my thoughts towards the music. In fact I liked the cast singing Abba's songs then Abba themselves. This movie did Abba's music Justice!!! The casting for the movie was stupendous. Meryl Streep's voice was breath taking in this movie! The emotion she used in the songs were great. The other stars were great, but not going to mention all and ruin the surprises of the film. Some of the parts in the film were very comedic with a little pizaz.

Features some great songs such as
Mamma Mia
Lay all your love on me
Thw winner takes it all(favorite of mine)
Money Money Money
Honey Honey
Take a Chance on Me

He asked me to mail him some music from the West. His choice form all the glittering tunes
available and forbidden to him was ABBA, so I hold their songs in some reverence.
And that music certainly deserves a better venue than this piece of trash. Everyone except the young
bride to be looks uncomfortable and no wonder--everyone is horribly miscast, and most can't
sing any better than Gabby Hayes or Andy Devine. I thought Pierce Brosnan merely stank up James
Bond movies, but it's nice to know that he's not tightly type cast and can stink up musicals as
well. Ms Streep similarly is woeful in this role. I do respect her earlier films so I know she can act, but
she left those abilities there with the hat-check girl when she entered the movie lot.
I can't for the life of me understand all the positive reviews of this film. Have musicals reached such
a deplorable state not no one remembers what a good one is like? Go watch West Side Story
or Camelot and leave this mess to someone unsophistocated enough to shell out for it. And in the future
please, Hollywood, stay far away from the individual who selected these ""actors""",1229212800,21,1230,4.471111111111111
3614876,4,B001GKJ2DY,Hearing the ABBA music was the best part of this movie to me.  The second best part was the scenery and the color.  And actually there wasn't anything wrong with the acting.  It's just that the movie is a musical after all which makes it a little hokey.  If you like musicals you will LOVE this movie.  If you don't like musicals then this one is not for you.,1229126400,5,359,4.144927536231884
3614877,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Adapted from the hit Broadway play,  MAMMA MIA! is a captivating movie musical that makes you want to sing right along with the Benny Andersson/Bjorn Ulvaeus music and lyrics, based on the songs of Abba.

In fact, one of the special features on the DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a Sing-Along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers.

Meryl Streep stars as the independently-minded owner of a broken down hotel on a remote island in Greece.  Her about-to-be wed daughter (Amanda Seyfried) does not know the identity of her father, since Mom was being romanced by three guys around the time she was conceived, so the young lady invites all three fellows to her wedding, signing Meryl's name to the invitation.  None of them have any idea that they might be the bride's father.

When Meryl sees the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) she just wants them to go away, but Amanda is not about to let that happen in this very fun, joyous musical comedy.

Beautifully photographed under the direction of Phyllida Lloyd, MAMMA MIA! has some terrific musical numbers, performed by Streep, Seyfried and Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, who play Meryl's lifelong girl friends.  Ms. Baranski is particularly delightful.

The men are not really singers, but they try hard and, truthfully, none of their songs require a strong voice.

Director Lloyd supplies audio commentary and there is also a deleted musical number.

3614878,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Having seen ""Mamma Mia!"" on the big screen and having fallen in love with its energy, musicality, comedy, and joy, in spite of its improbability, I was anxious to see how it would look on the ""little screen"" (DVD on home TV). Some films I've loved in the theater just don't look nearly as good on the little screen (for me, e.g., ""Titanic""). So when I stayed at a hotel that offers pay-per-view movies on TV and saw ""Mamma Mia!"" among the choices, I ordered it. It looked and sounded GREAT on the little screen! I can hardly wait to have my own copy! Ladies, if the man in your life is such a grouch that he refuses to watch this, or hates it if he does watch it, DUMP HIM.",1229040000,5,673,4.145038167938932

I never particularly liked or disliked ABBA, but now I find myself dancing & singing (not a pretty sight) no matter where I am when ""Dancing Queen"" comes on the radio.  I liked that Pierce Brosnan doesn't sing well - he gave it a good shot and it made the character more endearing to me.  But the revelation for me was Meryl Streep - she radiates pure joy.  Christine Baranski & Julie Walters are side splittingly funny.  I saw the stage show a few years ago and thought it was ""cute"".  The movie is a million times better in my opinion.",1228953600,5,634,4.198347107438017
3614881,3,B001GKJ2DY,"I admit that I am a life-long Abba fan (owning still all the original vinyl, a few 8 tracks, most of the earliest posters, etc.). I also have to admit that Tom Hanks' and Rita Wilson's movie version of the Broadway musical hit ""Mamma Mia"" (2008) is, well, disappointing. (Their chance to ""clean up"" this potentially fun musical is now lost.)

Benny's & Bjorn's music score happily resonates from the stage into this Greek isle flick (in deed, original Abba tunes and singing nicely underscore the entire movie background music). For the Abba-fanatics it is about their music!

The acting and singing, however, leave much to be desired. Everyone, except maybe the movie producers, knows that Abba music is best sung by female sopranos. Pierce Brosnan's tenor is higher than Meryl Streep's alto (together they butcher the classics from Agnetta and Frida!). Although James Bond (Brosnan's 55) may fit as Sophie's (well played by Amanda Seyfried) dad (better as granddad), Streep is totally miscast as Donna the mom (her grandma look-a-like jumps about like no other 59 year old can!). Lloyd's direction isn't up to par either- often actor heads bounce off the tops of the screen and sideways, out of view, as the camera can't keep up with chorographic telemetry.

The Greek isle and Mediterranean present a fairy tale ambiance, but this movie is not oriented for the family. Alcohol, sexuality, provocative innuendo, questionable language, fleshy dancing, and mature ""comedy"" all flow here (oddly, with all the other nasties going on in this movie, the final credits proffer an apology only for a very minor reference to tobacco- one brief unlit stogie).

This Hollywood flick's licentiousness is a far cry from Abba's original music that scores sing along words, images of mutual respect, flirtive romance, and fun spandex. ""Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find..."" in this screen play.

Abba purists will find this movie limiting and possibly unattractive. No recommendation is made to those considering watching this flick other than to take Donna the mom's advice in an early scene, ""Don't think about it"".",1228953600,6,2124,5.057142857142857

3614884,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Two facts MOST theater-lovers know early on:

1) Mama Mia on Broadway is the BEST time ever!
2) Movie adaptations of live theater are never as good.

That being said, I have a fresh idea about the recent movie version of ABBA's Mama Mia- FORGET ABOUT THE BROADWAY SHOW! Comparing the stage ""Spectacle"" and the movie is like comparing a big chocolate cake U can eat, to a picture of a chocolate cake you cannot. The picture of the cake will still make you smile, even if U cannot sink your teeth into it.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie version of Mama Mia. Essentially a story about a young woman getting married, it becomes a delicious twist of family secrets and revelations.  After she reads secret information kept by her mother, Donna, Sophie devises a plan she does not share with her mom.  She invites 3 strangers to her wedding, These men are all from her mom's past, a past Donna wants to keep distant. Sophie does share this plan with her 2 best friends and her fiance, BUT only after she sends the invitations. This sets in motion a madcap string of events with short and long-term effects. The audience can now sink their teeth into some fun escapades, as Sophie attempts to keep Donna in the dark as long as possible.

The cast of this movie is a dream. Taking some of Hollywood's Elite adds to the universal appeal to basically a niche(musical)movie. Even those people who are not fans of musicals can enjoy this movie for its star quality.

Meryl Streep, in the lead role of Donna Sheridan, is fantastic. She shows the struggle of a single mom, trying to make ends meet by running a hotel in Greece,  very authentically. The range of emotion the part of ""Donna"" requires, is second nature to Ms. Streep. And, while a complete shock to me, she must have known that her vocal ability was as on par as was needed. She was right. Her version of ""The Winner Takes it All"" is quite moving. Her transformation from serious, all-work-no-play, hard-nosed Donna to full of Life Donna is fun to watch.

As Sophie Sheridan, Amanda Seyfried, is both dainty and emotional. A relative newcomer(at least compared to the others in the cast) Ms. Seyfried commands the screen whenever she is the main focus. Her scene on the boat with her ""fathers"" is very moving. She also can carry quite a tune. ""Slipping through my Fingers"", the duet she shares with Ms. Streep is really fantastic.

The actors playing the 3 potential fathers are not quite up to the task in one way or another. The best of the bunch is Colin Firth, who plays Harry Bright.  His voice is quite good, although he has no real solo in the film. He does however have a big secret reveal towards the end of the film that was the one big plot line difference between stage musical and movie. It's a fun scene to witness.

Stellan Skarsgard, as Bill Anderson, is very funny in some scenes, touching in others. His voice is adequate, I guess. ""Our Last Summer"" is a song he sings with the other ""fathers"".

Then there is Pierce Brosnan, as Sam Carmichael. As far as acting goes, he is really good. The scenes he shares with Ms. Streep are really well-acted. HOWEVER, his singing is terrible. I mean REALLY BAD. Certain times, I thought a cat was being harmed slightly off camera. Some people were surprised to learn that Mr. Brosnan could sing, then they found out HE CANNOT!!!!!! But he was Bond...James Bond, so cut him some slack.

Two other big names round out the main cast of ""Mama Mia"". Christine Baranski, as Tanya, a many-times divorced boozer, is one third of Donna and the Dynamos, a girl-group from years ago. Ms Baranski is always a scene-stealer in any movie she is in. During one scene in ""Mama Mia"", Ms. Baranski tries to avert the advances of a friend of the groom-to-be. She sings ""Does Your Mother Know"" as a way to both flirt and repel this ""YOUNG man"". As a veteran of Broadway and the silver screen, Ms. Baranski's acting and vocal talents are very well perfected.

As ""Rosie"", Julie Walters is the second third of the group. Younger audiences know Ms. Walters as Mrs. Weasley, from the Harry Potter movies. ""Rosie"" is a semi-famous cookbook author who seems to fall hard for Stellan Skarsgard's ""Bill"". ""Take a chance on me"" is her play at a life with Bill. Both are fantastic.

So, Mama Mia, the MOVIE, is a fantastic time. Is it the same as seeing it on Broadway? Certainly not. But for reaching a far more widespread audience, this movie is perfect!",1228867200,7,4433,4.543287327478042

This movie would have been better if it hadn't had Perce Brosnan singing in it. His singing is horrendous ruining a great ABBA song: SOS

Well, apart from that, this movie is great fun... the only thing I didn't like is that here in Mexico it took a long time to be released. On top of that it was DUBBED IN SPANISH!!! Dubbing a movie into spanish is a big mistake since most of us mexicans like to watch it in its original audio. And dubbing a musical is the worst mistake, they talk in spanish and suddenly sing in english, it's terrible. Who came up with this, I don't know. I had to enter a VIP movie theater cause that is the only place showing it in English. CINEPOLIS should be ashamed.

ESPAOL:
Esta pelicula hubera sido mejor si no hubiera tenido a Pierce Brosnan cantando. Su canto fue horrendo arruinando una gran cancion de ABBA: SOS

Bueno, aparte de eso, esta pelicula fue muy divertida lo unico que no me gust fue que aqu en Mxico se tardo mucho en ser estrenada. Encima de eso estaba DOBLADA AL ESPAOL!!! Eso es un gran error ya que a la mayoria de nosotros los mexicanos nos gusta ver las peliculas con su idioma y audio original. Y doblar un musical es el peor de los errores, hablan en espaol y de repente cantan en ingls, es terrible. A quien se le ocurri esto, no lo s.

Can't wait for the dvd to hit my mailbox.  Yes, Brosnan can't hold a tune; but I give him credit for the attempt.  If he hadn't people would be complaining about that.  Meryl Streep was awesome.

3614890,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Before this movie, the only ABBA songs I knew were Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia and Fernando and thought they were merely a group from the seventies with a few hits and faded into obscurity. And when I bought the soundtrack for my mother for her birthday, I wondered how anybody in they're right mind could construct a musical around the songs of a pop group. So every year, there are movies that I set aside to see when they come out. This, originally, wasn't one of them. But after Indiana Jones, Get Smart, The Dark Knight, and The Mummy (which were all great don't get me wrong) but after all that action, maybe I needed something different. So I went to the theatre, with my mom and sister so as not to feel out of place amongst the miriade of women that would be in attendance, and didn't really expect much. I had the time of my life and this was absolutely one of the most wonderful experiences I ever had at the movies. The cast was amazing: I never saw Meryl Streep in a film before besides her cameo in the god awful Series of Unfortunate Events film adaptation and she astounded me with her voice (especially on her rendition of The Winner Takes It All). Pierce Brosnan was the biggest surprise to me (cause I never imagined a former James Bond being in a musical) but he too had a good singing voice (all of you people who says he can't just shut up and keep your opinions to yourselves. The ones who've criticized him probably have horrible voices themselves and just can't admit it). Her face and voice was familiar but I just couldn't place where I'd seen Christine Baranski before and then I remembered her supporting roles in Addams Family Values and The Grinch. And I couldn't believe that Amanda Seyfried played the dumb girl in Mean Girls so that too was a surprise. All in all it was a movie that made me feel good when I walked out of the theatre (aside from The Dark Knight, something that hardly happens) and the first real musical I've seen (I count The Blues Brothers films but they really aren't a traditional musical when you compare it to this.

The fun girl, the out of control, fully alive girl. I have not been alive for the longest time and this movie rejuvenated me back to the book of living.
It was 1974 when ABBA first touched my heart and got me dancing to the incredible beat of Waterloo. Then the words meant nothing to me as an 8 year old me hadn't yet been introduced to the secrets of a proverbial heart. It was simply innocence in motion as I flew around my uncle's house affirming that ABBA will win the Eurovision song contest and they'll be huge. A few hours later my prophecy came to be.
33 years later that song means something to me. Even better ""The winner takes it all"" is my life in a song,""SOS"" pleads my pain and confusion and ""Slipping through my fingers"" makes me weep like only a mother can. My life unfolds as I emerge into this corny yet so fascinating and skillfully cast musical of pure bliss and pleasure.
The young man,Sky,gets my heart racing but the sight of Colin Firth,Stellan Skarsgard and Pierce Brosnan brings me back to my age, with passion, and I see the threaded years becoming more appreciated as I drool over the older guys. It is great to be a mature woman and have these boyish and still hot as heat hunks enchanting all my sense buds from here to heaven. I am in love with all three of them, at the same time.
For all you hopeless romantics, once hurt twice-shy or simply the ones whom just want to enjoy a moment in time when everything else stops and bliss and sheer, bubbly fun takes over the whole body and sets you free to be silly,corny and goofy. Enjoy with all your might and keep on going back to that happy place over and over again.

3614902,3,B001GKJ2DY,"Imagine that you are a huge marquee movie star.  Perhaps you've got two Oscars to your name and untold nominations for gritty dark roles where you've had to assume  heavy European accents.  Perhaps you have embodied to fantastic accolades one of the staple characters of popular culture, be it Mr. Bond or Mr. Darcy.  You are a Serious Actor, not known for (or possessing) any particular musical theatre ability.  What would compel you to accept a role in an ABBA musical where you had to both sing and dance AND perhaps look generally ridiculous?  Maybe because you want to have some FUN at work, even if it's at your own expense and you have to spend half the movie in overalls and ratty sneakers?  Having a working holiday on a fabulous Greek island surely must render all other objections moot.  Meryl Streep is amazing; a force of nature who looks great for her age or frankly, any age.  She displays a real flair for physical comedy and a more-than-passable voice belting out some of ABBA's greatest hits.  The highlight for me was her empassioned rendering of ""The Winner Takes It All"" on a rocky Greek hillside.  She is the strongest voice in this cast of non-singers, and her zest for life is palpable.  The project has something of an air of an under-rehearsed production by a third-rate college drama department, but it's all in zany good fun.

Pierce was the weakest link in the singing department, but you can tell he really tried.  There was great chemistry among the cast.  This seemed like an enjoyable movie to work on.

The men played the so-called girl roles in this film, while the women ran the show.  So true to real life.  lol

 I would recommend this highly!",1228089600,2,649,4.145161290322581
3614905,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I love musicals. But I am very picky about which ones I watch, and which ones I buy for repeat performances. MAMA MIA was the first musical that multiple generations can appreciate. For the first time, I wasn't the young pup represented in most musicals, but the mother experiencing love lost, found again, and letting go of your children. I found myself amazed with Meryl Streep's voice, cheering on Pierce Brosnan's (and yes, sometimes he hit a sour note, but when your boyfriend is singing to you something really sweet...who cares?)and laughing at how the screenplay writers incorporated particular tunes (Chickadita! Loved it!). I love Christine Baranski and have became a new fan of Julie ___ (can't remember her last name). I would love to have a set of friends like Julie, Meryl, and Christine.

I grew up in the ABBA-hit era, but did not ""love"" them. They were another group that had some great songs. But I did really ""love"" the way that these songs were not stripped of their melody, and still the words represented something current.

There were silly gestures, and some cheesy dances...but I liked it. It made me smile. Like watching your folks dance....

Long and the short...Mama Mia is worth buying. Buy the soundtrack, buy the DVD. Make yourself feel good, without a therapist.",1228003200,3,1294,4.872727272727273

I'm not a fan of ABBA, but I don't hate their music... besides, it represents a generation, let's say it's part of history.  The situations together with lyrics were appropiated, on time... a pretty smart combination.  The performers had fun doing this movie and this is exported towards the audience you can notice that, you can feel it, just that fact makes you laugh and somehow be part of that experience.

3614907,5,B001GKJ2DY,"What can I say other than the music created by the Swedish musical group nearly 40 years ago is simply to be treasured by all ages.  I love ABBA music and waited years for the popular musical Mamma Mia to make it to the big screen and now Mamma Mia on DVD.  I have never been a huge fan of Meryl Streep but she gives a wonderful virtuoso performance in this movie.  Same for newcomer Amanda Seyfried.  Neither actress is known for their singing ability, but are simply messmerizing in Mamma Mia.  ABBA's music is timeless and pure joy in this romantic lost and found musical love story.  If you look hard one of the original members of ABBA has a cameo in the movie; one of the two ""BB"" (Bjorn ans Benny) in the sensational signing group's name.  The on location photography is beautiful in this movie as the story unfolds.  The only fairly deserved criticism is the signing of the leading man (aka 007).  Pierce Bronsan is way below par compared to the rest of the cast, but still nails his character's (dramatic) performance in this who's who of a Father-Daughter-Mother love story.  If you've seen the play, the story is still the same, if not a bit over the top.  Still, the signing and even the dancing in the movie version is just as entertaining and enjoyable to the audience.  One thing for sure this movie cries out to be HEARD, so turn up the volume and delight in all the stirring melodies and lyrical music of ABBA.  This DVD will make you feel good to be alive, and best enjoyed by singing along.  Why not?  Celebrate the music of Mamma Mia!",1227916800,3,1554,4.4035087719298245

In this brilliant, joyful film adaption of the hit stage show, 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) lives with her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on the small Greek island of Kalokairi where Donna runs a hotel called Villa Donna.
Sophie is about to be married and discovers that any one of 3 men could be her father. But is it Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) or Bill (Stellan Skarsgard)?
Sophie invites all 3 men to her wedding without telling Donna, who was the singer in a group called Donna and the Dynamos.

Glorious music and songs, imaginatively staged numbers and a fine sense of fun are present in this film. I loved it!

While Pierce Brosnan sounds awful, and sings like a lawnmower - and Colin Firth sounds rather nasal when singing ""Last Summer"" on guitar - in a funny way, the casting of actors who sing like us plebs works and adds to the fun and charm of the film. The wedding setting also works because you can imagine everyone at a wedding getting up and dancing or singing.
Meryl Streep has an excellent singing voice which will astonish sceptics, and I also thought the actress playing the daughter sang well!
The passionate renditions of The Winner Takes It All and Thank You For The Music are my highlights, and yet some uptempo songs are great too (Waterloo, Lay All Your Love On Me etc). I also think there are 1 or 2 touching moments in the film.
Yes the screenplay is very cheesy, and it may be camp as Christmas, but you will surely leave the theatre smiling.

This movie is meant for audience participation. That's why there are sub-titles/lyrics when the singing starts - Sing along! After the movie was released, ABBA's music had a revival.

And this is not really a movie - just an excuse to sing along to ABBA songs. And a reminder of when you used to know these songs so well.

To begin with, my Mom didn't know it featured ABBA music - and who knew - she doesn't like ABBA! Oops. So, this movie was not her favorite thing. In fact, she left the theater before the great credit performance. One of the best things, IMO.

My sister doesn't like musicals. Oops, I did it again. Guess I could have chosen some more likely-to-like-it companions for this theater visit, eh? Well, at least she was a great sport and laughed at herself - and maybe even at parts of the movie!

Now, me. I. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.

It is, as my title says, a total cheese-fest. It is. But when you're having so much fun, who CARES?!? It's campy and silly and there's some definite over-acting going on, but so what? It's brilliant.

3614917,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I never could stand ABBA even when they were popular, Dancing Queen made my skin crawl. I had no plans or desire to see the show. When a friend wanted to see it in Las Vegas I considered it a huge waste of time and money ($110 seats) but went along to be polite.
It was magic. I've been back since and will go again before it closes there in Jan '09. I cannot say enough good things about the Vegas stage show.
For the movie... they take the story line and ruin it. The whole point is a cast of six adult leads who are jaded by the choices they've made,  everyone else is young, vital and searching for the most they can find in their bright shiny new lives. All is demonstrated through constant action and singing.
Lead role Donna (streep) should be early 40's in age. They picked Streep and turned it into a senior moment. She can't solve a 20 year age discrepancy. Then they have to surround her with senior friends, one of whom couldn't carry a tune in a bucket (Brosnan), he tries so hard it's painful. Even the movie supporting cast are villagers (mostly old ones disconnected from the plot) instead of the young locals in the stage show, who work at the taverna Donna runs.
I'm not young and I tire of the constant need to feature youth as the epitomy of life, but in this case the story demands it. The stage show features youth and vitality because it's central to the theme of the story (not to mention 90 mins of dancing). One would expect the long shooting scedule of a movie to allow better casting, not worse. Clearly they went for names in the movie, without regard to the plot.
The ultimate scene in the play is on a beach, cast members dancing in costumes that are so over the top it's hilarious. In the movie it becomes about 5 seconds of dancing on a dock sans costumes. Deflating at best.  Same for the flashback scene when the 3 female leads reprise singing in their old band - the costumes make the moment. In the movie the costumes are totally different, and dull.
If you haven't seen the show, see the movie first. If you've seen the show, borrow this from the library, don't waste your money.",1227312000,15,2117,4.316582914572864

3614930,5,B001GKJ2DY,"""Mamma Mia,""a new romantic musical comedy of a film, arrives, bringing joy to many.  It is based on the stage play of the same name that was a major international hit, and, ultimately, on the internationally popular music, largely disco-style, of the 1970's Swedish group ABBA.  The film, which I'd have to guess mainly appeals to women, older women at that, is a product of women to some degree: written by Catherine Johnson, directed by Phyllida Lloyd.  And, as you might expect, it generally has not been popular with mainstream critics, particularly the male ones.

The film is lovely to look at: it's set, as was the stage play, on one of those picturesque Greek islands; and the breathtaking exteriors were filmed on one of them.  Interiors, however, and the major setting, Villa Donna, the small resort owned by the major character, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), supposedly on that Greek island, were filmed at Pinewood Studios, England.  Some critics have complained about the cinematography, but really, who can carp when it's showing such lovely views?  I also found it slightly too long; there was a hard-to-believe moment when I was a little tired of big, pull out all the stops, production numbers.

The plot's simple enough, even silly, and downright illogical and unscientific.  Donna, who was a tribute performer back in her day - and ABBA's --largely doing their material, it appears, would be the first to tell you, as she labors in her only moderately successful little resort, that she's a reformed slut.  Her daughter, Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried), has, accordingly, never known her father.  And Sophie's getting married now to Sky (Dominic Cooper); she wants her father to give her away.  So she finds Mom's old diary, identifies the three most likely candidates, and sends them invites: apparently Donna was prescient enough to identify them in her diary not only by their full names, but by what would be their addresses twenty years later.  (Pity she didn't identify them by their DNA at the same time; her daughter would have been spared so much uncertainty.)  The three men show up: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan, former James Bond); Harry Bright (the dishy Colin Firth), and Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard, generally considered to be a serious actor, and a good one.) Just to add to the fun, Donna's former singing partners show up too: Tanya (Christine Baranski, an American musical comedy and television performer) and Rosie (Julie Walters, a respected serious British actress).  Two of daughter Sophie's friends show up too, the movie's crazy for triads.

Well, these performers have to sing, of course, those ABBA songs.  It was obviously no problem for Streep; she appears to be having a great time of it.  But then, she's that phenomenon that famed Broadway guru Hal Prince once highly praised, an actress that can sing: and I've seen her sing previously in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Postcards-from-the-Edge/dp/B000059XTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Postcards from the Edge</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Prairie-Home-Companion/dp/B000H6SXYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Prairie Home Companion</a>, among other films.  Critics have complained that her ""Winner Takes It All"" is over baked; if they'd seen the stage show, as I have, they'd know that song functions as what Broadway calls ""the 11 o'clock number."" That is, the song, near the end of the show that producers rely on to send the audience out humming, and recommending the entertainment to their friends.  It's supposed to be powerfully presented, guys.  Major complaints about Brosnan's voice, too: we can all agree he'll never be invited to the Metropolitan Opera, but, still, his voice is perfectly adequate to the task.  However, the critics have praised Walters' closing number, delivered as the mythical ancient ""Fountain of Aphrodite,"" which Donna's inn is supposedly built over, explodes during a minor earthquake.  Walters has a get up on the table, knock `em dead, shake your money maker classic here; and she deserves every syllable of praise she gets.

Basically, despite the attractive and talented young leads, the show functions as an evocative middle-aged romance, of which the media give us too few.  This one is really meant for people who were around at the time, dancing to ABBA; something for the girls, in particular: that would be the older girls now.  I've seen a TV documentary on ABBA, and all four of the quartet agreed: even while they were recording ""Dancing Queen,"" they knew it would be a monster hit.  And it was, and it is still.  My favorite scene: as the entire island apparently breaks into that song, a Greek farm woman, no longer young, carrying a heavy load of kindling on her head, thinks about it, decides there's time enough to carry kindling, sets it down and joins the dance.  Fellas: throughout life, most women are carrying heavy loads of kindling: and we enjoy the chance to set them down and dance.  As various people have said, life is short and death is long: and you'd better dance while you can, little man.  Little woman, too.  In fact, I've said it before and I'll say it again, Gloria Gaynor's monster, international disco hit, ""I Will Survive,"" functions as an anthem to current day women, well beyond the English-speaking world.  And any English-speaking woman who claims not to know it is a liar.

To be sure, rock critics of the day always hated disco, and you still see the odd bumper sticker, ""Disco Sucks.""  Why ever?  Well, having the biggest ""cojones"" was important to those largely male critics, and disco was loved, heavens, by gays.  And women, and quite ordinary people, who liked to dance.  And the songs said nothing whatever about the state of the world, or Euclidean geometry.  Seems to me many of today's movie critics hearken back to these guys.  However, very recently, I saw a newspaper article that said medical men had found that people delivering CPR (Cardio pulmonary resuscitation) to people with failing hearts were most successful doing it to the Bee Gees' seminal disco tune ""Staying Alive."" It helped the rescuers even to be thinking the tune, or singing it to themselves, because, you see, the song has slightly more than 100 beats a minute, and so has the heart.  The medical men didn't know the reason, but I do. Because I once saw a documentary about the Australian group, the Bee Gees, generally considered the fathers of disco, who said that they took that beat from the Australian aborigines.  That song, folks, is in the key of life.",1226620800,16,6632,5.136871508379889

I managed to miss every touring company that played LA, though I would have loved to see and hear Judy Kaye as one of the friends in the original Broadway production.  Now there's another incredible actress singer treading the boards.  But I was lucky enough to have seen Meryl Streep sing on stage (her brilliant version of Surabaya Johnny from HAPPY END on Broadway in the late 70's beat Bette Midler's version recorded around that time).  And that teaser at the end of POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE....c'mon, the woman is a national treasure.

So I saw the previews.....take me to that island right away.  Certainly a total rip off of BUONA SERRA, MRS CAMPBELL, but set in Greece.  And a chick flick?  Chicks over 45.....don't forget they are still alive and vibrant.  And Streep, Baranski and Walters lay it on with gusto, joy and lots of fun.  In fact, that's what I liked most about the film: everyone seemed to be having a good time.  And what's the problem with Brosnan's singing?  Does everyone have to sound like Pavarotti?  I think everyone brought a sense of play and fun and romance to a pretty thin script.

And what was wrong with the long line dances on piers and patios?  Anyone caught the Rockettes lately?

It's a musical aimed at the over 40 set, and I had a terrific time in the Mediterranean sun for a couple of hours.  And I will definitely get the film to re-enjoy it all.  So TAKE THAT all you grinches out there.",1226361600,5,1535,4.503623188405797

THE MUSIC, THE DANCING, THE JIVING, MERYL, PIERCE, THE REST OF THE CAST MIX AND MINGLE TOGETHER LIKE THEY ARE HAVING THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES.  COLIN FIRTH IS A TOTAL DREAM BUCKET IN THIS ROLE, HE PLAYS IT TO THE TEE. MY GOSH AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE 8 TIMES YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH PIERCE'S VOICE, IT BECOMES SEXY. MY DAUGHTER AND I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AND HAVE BEEN BREATHLESSLY AWAITING THE RELEASE DATE FOR THE DVD. WE AND THE AUDIENCE SING AND DANCE IN OUR SEATS.  WHEN THEY CAME OUT WITH THE SING-ALONG VERSION, WE WERE LIKE SCHOOLGIRLS WITH A CRUSH AND I'M 50. I LOVED THE COURTYARD SCENE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THERE START TO SING S.O.S.!!!! IF YOUR A FAN OF THE MUSIC OF ABBA PLEASE TAKE THE TIME AND HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.  THIS MOVIE MADE OUR SUMMER OF 08' AWESOME.

3614935,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I have now seen this movie 7 (SEVEN) times in the theatre because never before has a movie made me this HAPPY!  I don't think I've seen any other movie that many times even after it appears for free on tv.  Anyone who can't just sit back & enjoy it for the pure entertainment factor it provides, is either a snob or a scrooge.  You will fall in love with Greece, ABBA music, Meryl Streep & most especially for me, Pierce Brosnan.  True, he doesn't have a trained voice, but the charm & sincerity with which he sings & portrays this character supercedes anything else.  I was never a fan before but I am now!  Can't wait until it comes out on dvd so I can watch it as often as I want on my new hd tv!  Now that I think of it, this will make a fabulous Christmas gift for everyone on my list!  Mamma Mia! for everyone!",1226361600,3,816,4.05625
3614936,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Watching this movie is like visiting a seaside amusement park with its ferris wheel and whirling carousel-strolling through a gaudy and brightly colored penny arcade-feasting on cotton candy and salt water taffy-walking barefoot on the sand with your own dancing queen.  Thirty years on the songs of ABBA are still delightful and deliciously infectious as ever and elevate this paper-thin wisp of a story. The main thrust of the movie is a young bride-to-be(Sophie) anxious to find out which of her mothers(Donna) three lovers is her dad. Unlike the original show which made it obvious who the dad was, the movie does not settle the question and instead all three potential dads declare each is 1/3 Sophies father.

Meryl Streep playing Donna is wonderful and takes a break from her usual more serious roles and is obviously having a ball.  A new actress named Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is a real find and she is the best singer in the movie.  Unfortunatly one of her songs ""The Name of the Game"" was cut from the film and was presumably sung after she has a spat with her husband-to-be,Sky.  The next time you see the pair they are as happy as clams so both the missing song and the missing subsequent making-up scene leaves a gap in the movie. But why complain? The movie is so vibrant and perky and loaded with some of ABBAS' best songs, fun performances, colorful costumes and scenery the lapse is but a breeze in a hurricane of entertainment.

I can't end this without a mention of the much maligned Pierce Brosnan and his attempted homicide of singing.  I think I have solved the problem-he sings through his nose suffering from a headcold.  However I have to give him props for his brave and not bad at all rendition of ""When All is Said and Done""-nose and all.

Very nice movie and if you can't have ABBA at least you have some of their biggest hits delightfully performed.",1226275200,2,1881,4.641566265060241
3614937,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I loved this film.  The ultimate ""chick flick""! I actually saw it twice in the theater.  It is a great movie to see with your girlfriends or your mom.  It's one of those movies that just begs to be shared.  You end the movie just feeling happy and the music of Abba is, of course, catchy.  Meryl Streep was amazing and blew me away.  I had no idea she could sing like that.  Not all the actors could sing well, but it didn't take away from the movie for me.",1226275200,4,457,4.011111111111111
3614938,5,B001GKJ2DY,"Mamma Mia! opened on July 10th in the Philippines which was more than a week ahead of its US release on July 18th. It ran for almost 3 months in theaters here in Manila where a hit movie would probably last up to three (3) weeks and a dud would just play for a few days. I saw this film almost 20 times in different theaters around Manila and saw how people from all ages - the teens to the older generation - enjoyed the film. Maybe it was the music, maybe it was the acting and the singing, maybe it was the lush setting in Greece. It was all of these. The producers were able to weave a wonderful story of love lost and found amidst an impending wedding set in a remote Greek island with the timeless tunes of ABBA. What really helped in the appreciation of ABBA's music was the familiar arrangements which Benny and Bjorn did not change but even enhanced a bit. The familiarity really struck a nostalgic chord especially with the generation who grew up with ABBA's music. The showstopper of course was Dancing Queen played in the middle of the film where Donna and the Dynamos start singing in the room and go out into the streets and are joined by the village women in an anthem of woman empowerment. Even the finale is wonderful where they sing Dancing Queen as a trio with Waterloo as the fitting ending song where the Dynamos are joined by the men and the young couple Sophie and Sky. Believe it or not, in the Philippines, people never stay for the credits and in fact automatically head for the exit when a movie or a concert finishes (it's a given - they have no appreciation for credits and would rather be ahead of the rest in getting out of the venue) but with Mamma Mia! people really stayed to see Dancing Queen again and until Waterloo was over - and some stayed until the final notes of Thank You for the Music. I was aghast to read that critics bashed Mamma Mia! But this is plain amusing to most of the people who appreciated this wonderful film. Critics and bashers can say all the negative things they want but the people have spoken with it's resounding commercial success - Mamma Mia's soundtrack hit No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums and has been certified platinum (no ABBA album ever hit the Top 10 in the US). Mamma Mia! the movie has grossed almost $144 MM at the US box-office to make it the 4th biggest grossing musical of all time in the US (behind Grease, Chicago and The Sound of Music). Mamma Mia! the movie did even better in the UK because it has grossed 67 MM pounds and is the second biggest film of all time in the UK behind Titanic which grossed 69 MM pounds. Not bad indeed! Bravo to the cast! Meryl Streep proved in this film that she can do absolutely anything! America's finest actress is poised for a double win at the Golden Globes in 2009 -Best Actress in a Musical / Comedy for Mamma Mia! (her brilliant singing in Winner Takes it All alone can make her win the Globe) and Best Actress in a Drama for Doubt. A fitting reward for a truly great actress! The upcoming DVD deserves all the attention it can get. The perfect Christmas gift. Cheers!!!",1226275200,3,3098,4.333907056798623

Not many films can promise that anymore! I've dragged my husband to many movies and he hymned and hawed about sitting through everyone ... this one included. But this was the first time he ever wanted to stay in the theater and watch it again RIGHT AWAY! It doesn't matter if Pierce Brosnan can't sing ... I can't sing either. It didn't stop him and it didn't stop me!

Mamma Mia! made me feel happy, and like other reviewers here, I was bopping along with the music. I've rarely seen such chemistry in a cast, and they truly looked like they were having a ball! (If this cast was faking that, they should all get Oscars.) Pierce Brosnan might not have the greatest singing voice, but his acting was superb. And who knew that Colin Firth could sing so well! But it was Meryl Streep's ""The Winner Takes It All"" that gave me goosebumps. My friends and I will all be buying Mamma Mia! when it is released.",1226188800,5,645,4.295081967213115

Is funny when you consider yourself someone more like in the dark side of art, specially movies, and sometimes, there it comes, a movie like Mamma Mia which is so corny but overwhelms you with joy, music and dancing! and you just can't stop loving it...
why?
-the play is beautifull and the songs match perfectly with this simple but wondefull adventure, yes! I see mamma mia like an adventure movie, is a emotional adventure.
-ABBA, well, who can denay it... ABBA's music is just wonderfull, the catchy tunes, the wonderfull lyrics, there's something for everybody in Abba's songs.
-I was surprised how beautifull was to see the Island taking part of the movie experience though the beautifull colorfull shots of the water, white colored houses, trees and so on....
-I love the feelings of joy this movie brings to everybody, I was so proud of my best friend the first night we saw it at the movie theater, she took out a bottle of mineral water from her purse and tell me: ""I brought some rum, handle me you coca cola light"" it was a blast! we were six friends, and just saw the play in NYC 8 months ago... is nice to see people crying of joy. :)
-Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfriend!!! Meryl, I saw you filming in Paris 4 months ago, you seem like just a joy to withhold. This movie was efertoless for you, you enjoy life like this! The number with Amanda seyfried ""Slipping through my fingers"" Amanda amazingly and beautifully fills the silver screen at the side of Meryl in this one, Hope to see more of you in movies to come.
-Aging is sexy!!!!!

and well, enjoy this movie with no Guilt! is wonderfull! :DDDDDDD",1226102400,3,1699,4.463022508038585

I loved the singing, dancing and dialoge. It captures all stages of life and relationships. Finding and loosing the love of your life (and finding again), parent- child relationships and best friends. I don't think I stopped smiling for hours each time I saw it. A chance to escape the stresses of life, to get lost in the beautiful scenery, to bask in the good feelings, to bop to the music. This movie has it all. After the stresses of the election season & the economy, I look forward to my escape to the world of Mamma Mia. Actors were wonderful, voices were sharp, and fun was had by all.

The first time that I viewed it I found it mesmerizing... the fantastic scenery, the most beautiful water scenes that I have ever witnessed, and then the music... the music!  I ended up seeing it a half-dozen times in the theater, and never once did I not feel a flood of true joy bursting out from the spirit and beauty of this special film.",1225929600,,588,4.425925925925926

One thing is for sure, Meryl Steep can do anything, I mean, could this role have been any different than her recent turn as Miranda Priestly?  As for Brosnan, I liked him in this, he gave his all, and get real we all figured he could not hold a tune, I mean, everybody should have one flaw, I mean, right?  Really, you cant beat the ABBA tunes in this, they are so gloriously Disco and the Greek Island local is breathtakingly beautiful.  One thing is for sure, everybody in this seemed to be having the time of their lives and that sort of thing is contagious, whether the film is Citizen Cane or not.",1225929600,7,680,4.2890625
3614949,1,B001GKJ2DY,"Ok, so I love Abba and Meryl Streep--she's one of my favorite actresses.  I also loved Mamma Mia on Broadway the three times I saw it there--but this movie was awful!  Yes, everyone acted very well, but it did not translate well to the big screen in this adaptation.  The minute the movie started I could tell it was going to be a mess, with the cast in that ""Look at us--we're in a musical!"" mode. The lighting was so terrible, when scenes transitioned I kept thinking they were going to be dream sequences with the overly bright halo effect lighting that was scattered throughout the film.  Poor Meryl Streep didn't even escape unscathed as the movie was so embarrassing to watch.  I would have walked out if I had been alone, but my partner, who is not a very discerning movie viewer, kept thinking it would get better.  He has rarely ever said that he did not like a movie we've been to, but even he said he hated it afterwards.  Don't think it was because we're not 50-something women either--we usually love chick flicks!",1225843200,11,1027,4.489247311827957
3614950,5,B001GKJ2DY,"I saw this movie in a movie theater, on big screen, so, watching this one at home may not be as exhilarating as at the cinema. And I tell you, I am not an ABBA fan, but:I loved it!!! Of course the plot is simple, and not be taken too serious, but the critics slamming this movie? It was supposed to be a fun musical, happy and sunny, and it should be judged  as entertainment. It was cute and fun. The scenery was so beautiful, interiors and architecture to savor. The movie has a refreshing simplicity. I like very serious artistic movies, but geeez! I also need fun! This one gave me a lot of fun, I saw it twice. Very energizing music, escapist movie, which brings joy and sunshine. I was never Abba fan, but I really enjoyed the music this time.

As for singing and dancing: some actors are not musical performers. And they still do great. Different set of performing skills is needed when a musical takes place on stage, and different acting is  needed for a movie. I admire some of the actors for acting and singing and dancing so well. Who knew Meryl Strep could sing so good, as one of the reviewers  said. I didn't know!

As for Brosnan who was criticized about his singing: it was not so bad. Some critics teared his flesh, laughing how much he was whining, how bad his singing was.(Outside the Amazon.com critics). Actually, it was a very difficult song to sing, and in addition he was acting and was trying to make the  song as expressive as possible. He got the most difficult song to sing. It reminded me of situation when people listen to old records of opera singers of the turn of the century, and than criticize them they couldn't sing. Without understanding how much of technical difficulity brings singing with such voice, and the technique used for it. Don't get me wrong, I don't equal him with the great voices of the turn of the XIX and XXc. Just pointing similarity of reactions, dismissing the performance without appreciating the fact that such singing is horribly difficult. I think he did quite well, given the challenge he had.",1225756800,5,2057,4.501340482573727

Sure there are some points of bad camera work and Brosnan's voice isn't classically trained, but who cares? He sings well enough, and his singing really grows on you through the movie.

It's a fun movie with catchy songs, a fun story, and a happy ending. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I can't wait to own the DVD the second it comes out.

Ok, so Pierce Brosnan isn't the best singer in the world.  You know what?  I've paid a whole lot more money to see people in concert that were suppose to be great singers and were so much worse than Pierce. Besides if you don't want to listen to him just watch him.  He's showing some age(but then aren't we all) he's still quite attractive.  I think Merryl Streep did an incredible job.  Who knew she could sing like that?!  And Donna's two friends are a hoot.  And I think the girl that plays Sophie is adorable.

In today's times it's great to be able to sit down with a movie and not have to think about it.  Just be entertained by it.  It's a great ""bad day"" movie.  Go home put your feet up and just veg out.  Sure to improve your bad mood greatly!!",1225670400,187,898,4.080459770114943

3614958,1,B001GKJ2DY,"I saw the play in London several years ago and even though it didn't strike me back then as a work of art, compared to this movie it sure felt like it. While I appreciate Streep's charisma in a part which really doesn't play to her incredible dramatic skills, everybody else in the cast gave me the feeling I was watching an improvised high school play done by people with very little talent. I was always a fan of Brosnan's James Bond but his musical talents are no more than mediocre, specially while singing (that may be too strong a word) SOS and just standing there with not much to do but stare at Meryl, during her interpretation of THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL. I also found odd they would choose such an weird looking girl in the lead (with eyes just like a frog). I guess it didn't feel to surprising that with so many people dancing near the water, a bunch of them would ""accidentaly"" fall in it and it's not like I was expecting CASABLANCA but the only fun I had in watching MAMMA MIA was laughing at its awfulness.
