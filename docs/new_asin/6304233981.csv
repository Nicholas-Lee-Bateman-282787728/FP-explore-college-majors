8156997,5,6304233981,"There are two episodes on this tape.  The Mercenaries and The Exchange.  The Exchange is a major and exciting departure for M.I.  It is the only episode where an MI agent is captured (Cinnamon) at the beginning.  The entire show is based on an exciting and creative ""rescue"".
This is a show that the creator (Bruce Gellar) did not want to make.  Later this became one of his favorite shows.  Phelps is clearly pained by Cinnamons capture and the rescue is a ""cold war"" stroke of genius.  A must see!!",979776000,14,500,4.488888888888889
8156998,5,6304233981,"I renember of watching ""The Mercenaries"" for the first time. I consider it one of the bets MI episodes ever! It was very inteligent.
 I have the picture of the villian (with a Fidel Castro looking) shooting Rollin when he fiunds ot that Rollin is an IMF agent.
  The golden stealing scene was really well planed and really well done (I hear that the golden bars whre Ice Creams tablets). I read in a megazine that this scene became very famous.
  It was always good to see IMF on action. In my opinion, ""The Mercenaries is the second best episode of MI's season 3. It only looses for ""The Mind of Staphan Miklos"".",971913600,12,613,4.389380530973451
