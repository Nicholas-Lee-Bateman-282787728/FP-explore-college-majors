8160322,5,B000L83TEK,"I normally don't enjoy Shakespeare performed with a ""modern"" setting, preferring to see his plays as they would have been played 400 years ago - but for this RSC production I'm making an exception. The plot is one of old. 2 men (Valentine and Proteus) fall for the same girl (Silvia). Proteus abandons the girl he betrothed himself too (Julia) who follows Proteus to try and win him back. Needless to say it all comes to blows and almost ends with Valentine killing Proteus, but Silvia intervenes and the couples are reconciled. This production sets the play in Italian cafe culture, then transitions to a nightclub (and the obligatory ""it girl""
Pics of Silvia posing with her admirers) to a woodland scene. The transition is effortless. The men in sharp suits and women in haute couture. But all eventually in rags essentially fighting for their lives. How the mighty fall, and are humbled in the process. I loved every minute and so will you",1455753600,6,943,4.7560975609756095
8160323,5,B000L83TEK,"The Royal Shakespeare Company deserves a standing ovation for their production of Two Gentlemen of Verona. For some unexplained reasons, this play has been rather ignored by theatres and movie companies. Yet, the play describes an important event within Shakespeares narrative. This event is the union of two couples who are married in the same place and at the same time. This union is an intermediate step leading to the ultimate outcome of Shakespeares narrative: the union of four couples who are married in the same place and at the same time. According to Shakespeares symbolic illustration, a union of four couples is needed for a new perfected being to appear (eight that must take hands
to join in Hymens bands, if truth holds true contents). This process is like an alchemical transmutation that allows to get hold of a precious jewel, which otherwise remains hidden (like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head.) This is why some details of Shakespeares narrative are beyond the comprehension of ordinary intellect and rationality. It is in this context that the final scene of Two Gentlemen of Verona is particularly challenging for theatre and movie directors. In this scene, Valentine is handing over his beloved Silvia to his friend Proteus. When commenting on this scene, Harold Bloom famously asked: What is the actress playing Silvia supposed to do with herself? It looks like that Simon Godwin, the director of this RSCs production, was able to find a solution. Instead of being passive, Silvia, without saying a word, is getting involved in the situation. It is a very brave and brilliant solution. Mr. Godwin provides a partially rational explanation to this scene, but without removing its ambiguity. The spectators leaving the performance still may be asking themselves why Valentine gave away Silvia, why Silvia did not protest, and how it was possible for Proteus to go through such an instant reformation. As always, the audience may find answers to these questions in the remaining episodes of Shakespeares narrative. In the meantime, we can all enjoy this excellently done performance.",1451779200,4,2142,5.105413105413105

8160325,5,B000L83TEK,"I saw The Two Gentlemen of Verona twice in Stratford-Upon-Avon, the second time being the evening that was filmed for this DVD and Blu-Ray. Here's my review of the play:

If you know a few Shakespeare plays, you certainly know Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and maybe a few of the history plays. Some of the comedies are well known: Much Ado about Nothing, As You Like It, and A Midsummer Nights Dream. And everyone knows Romeo and Juliet.

But in the canon, there are a number of plays that are rarely performed, and that most people are unfamiliar with. The Two Gentlemen of Verona is one of these. The Royal Shakespeare Company has not performed this play on its main stage in 45 years, and I attended the opening night of the current production in Stratford-upon-Avon.

I admit going to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre last night with a bit of trepidation. I only know this play from the BBCs forgettable television production of the 1980s. The Guardian recently ran an article discussing Why Shakespeares Two Gentlemen of Verona is as flawed as it is fascinating, and the play certainly has its weaknesses.

The Two Gents has one of those convoluted love stories that show up in some of Shakespeares comedies: two friends fall in love with the same woman but one has already sworn his love to another woman, and the second is not considered good enough for her. There is love, betrayal, banishment, and cross-dressing.

Valentine travels to Milan to see more of the world. He wants his friend Proteus to travel with him, but Proteus is in love with Julia and doesnt want to leave. Proteus father finally convinces him to travel to Milan, and he departs from Julia tearfully.

When Proteus arrives in Milan, he finds that Valentine is in love with Silvia, the daughter of the Duke, but she is promised to Turio. Proteus instantly falls in love with Julia, and this sets up the plot of the two friends vying for the same woman. Valentine is eventually banished from Milan, and Proteus declares his love to Sylvia.

Julia decides to go to Milan to seek out Proteus, but does so disguised as a young man, Sebastian. He eventually takes her into his service as a page, and sends her to Sylvia to present her with a ring; the same ring that Julia had given Proteus when they parted company.

Proteus had told Silvia that Valentine was dead, but she was not convinced, and set off to find him. Valentine had actually been captured by some outlaws, and became their leader. The outlaws capture Sylvia, then encounter Proteus and Julia  still in the disguise of a young man  and take them to Valentine. After a bit of confusion and some fighting, they sort things out, and the two couples end up together, planning to be married.

One of Shakespeares earliest plays, the Two Gentlemen of Verona does not feature the exquisite language we know in Shakespeares later plays, and is, at times, a bit clunky. Considered to be one of his weakest plays, it is often ignored, and the long hiatus in productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company has only been interrupted because they are in the process of performing all of Shakespeares plays from the First Folio. If you look at the main page of the RSCs website, this play is barely mentioned; there is a very small graphic talking about a broadcast to schools, but unless you click the Whats On link you might not even know that its being performed. Its almost as if they're embarrassed to be putting on this play.

Well, they certainly shouldnt be. From beginning to end, the performance I saw last night was scintillating. Sure, this is not Shakespeares finest play, the language is not as good as his best works, but this was a delightful night of theater performed by a cast that was clearly enjoying themselves.

The play began before it started; upon entering the theater, spectators saw a set like an outdoor caf in Italy with the actors milling around, sitting at the tables, talking to each other. Panthino  played by Simon Yadoo  went out into the audience and fetched people, singly and in pairs, to bring them up on stage and walk them to the back to get some ice cream. This was a nice touch; it made me feel as a spectator  sitting in the first row on the side of the stage  as though the audience was part of the experience.

The first few minutes felt a bit strained; it was opening night, what the English call press night. It seems that here in the UK critics all come on the same evening, rather than showing up when they want to review a play. This probably causes a fair amount of stress among the performers, knowing that this night is the one by which their production will be judged.

But once things got moving, they didn't stop. The play was fast-paced, and the comic timing among the cast was impeccable. The laughter in the audience showed that the comedy worked very well. Sure, there were some jokes that didn't work, because of the old language, but I could tell that the cast truly believed in this play, and their earnestness was infectious.

One set piece that literally brought the house down was when Turio, accompanied by a gaggle of musicians  including Proteus  went to serenade Sylvia. Nicholas Gerard-Martin who played this character as a bumbling yokel sang a song a bit like a Barry Manilow wannabe at the Eurovision song contest. The applause he received after singing this song was recognition of how good his campy performance as a singer was, but also how enjoyable to play was up to that point.

Another enjoyable part of the play that was the scenes when Launce came on stage with Crab, a dog, played by Mossup. Launces witty words were accompanied by Crabs surprisingly appropriate expressions, and the audience was heard to say Awww as the dog nearly stole the first scene he appeared in. (Its too bad that Shakespeare didn't write any plays with kitties; my cat Titus would be great on stage.)

In the more dramatic moments, the audience hung on the actors every word. The soliloquies gave several of the young actors to show off their individual talents. The final scene, which takes place in a dark forest, contains a great deal of violence and tension, but none of it felt contrived. Slightly at odds with the rest of the play, this long scene resolves the play through a contrast in the violence between Proteus and Valentine, and Proteus threat of raping Sylvia.

There are no weak actors in the young cast of this play. Mark Arends as Proteus and Michael Marcus as Valentine are a fine pair of friends. Roger Morlidge as Launce was nearly Falstaffian in his wit. And the women  Pearl Chanda as Julia and Sarah MacRae as Silvia  were delightful. Leigh Quinn as Lucetta shone, with her slightly hammy attitude, though I had a bit of difficulty understanding her fast-spoken Northern accent. And Martin Bassindale as Speed was witty and exuberant, notably in a scene with Launce. Since this is a play without a star, the company shone as a company, with a cohesion that was evident throughout.

The direction and staging of this play were excellent. There were a number of sets, from the Italian caf to the Dukes house in Milan; from a disco to the dark, camouflaged forest, providing a great deal of variety in the settings. The lights were a bit annoying, however. Sitting on the side of the stage, I was blinded during some scenes by three bright banks of lights on the other side, one at each level of the theater. Ive sat in that location for several plays in the theater, and never noticed the lights to be a bother.

The play clocks in at about 2:20, plus a 20-minute intermission. I was starting to get antsy near the end of the first part, and, when I checked the time, I saw that it had lasted 1:25. The second part was therefore quite short, and the time flew by.

As I said earlier, the RSC seems to be a bit embarrassed about putting on this play. The plays short run  only seven weeks, followed by a week in Newcastle  suggests that they didn't think that this play would sell very well. Fortunately, it will be filmed and broadcast to cinemas on September 3, and subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray.

Thinking back after the performance was over, I compared it in my mind to the other two plays currently at the Royal Shakespeare Theater. I very much enjoyed Henry IV part 1 and Henry IV part 2, but each of those plays had their good moments and some longeurs. Last night, after seeing The Two Gentlemen of Verona, I realized that there was nothing boring about this play, and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Its interesting that, of the eight plays Ive seen in the past year and a half at the RSC, the two that are considered to be weak plays  this one and Titus Andronicus  have turned out to be among the best productions. Which makes me wonder; are they weak plays, or have they just been weakly produced?

Kudos to director Simon Godwin, and to the entire cast, for making The Two Gentlement of Verona a delightful evening of theater.",1427760000,15,8962,4.593358395989975
8160326,4,B000L83TEK,"Shakespeare here proposes a pure entertainment. Two young men in love with the same woman, and two ladies in love with one of each of these two men. It so happens one man necessarily loves the woman who is the common love to both and the other woman loves the second man.

It is then a story of plotting, betraying, cheating, and all variations on these three themes for the one who loves the woman the two men love and is not love by that woman to try to force his choice onto her against the other man who is supposed to be his best friend.

The rest is nothing but circumstances. The couple that shares a mutual love will finally come together and the man who lost that woman will accept the love of the other woman. Hence we will end with two happy couples or at least two happily married couples, which is weak in Shakespeare's dramatic patterns.

All is well that ends well and it was all much ado about nothing. The play is particularly light because of the numerous musics that take it along on a brisk Elizabethan path. You know something is awry when Launce, Proteus' servant, describes the woman he loves in the style of some official statute.

""the catalog of her condition: Imprimis: She can fetch and carry. [...] Item: She can milk. [...] Imprimis: She can milk. [...] Item: She brews good ale. [...] Item: She can sew. [...] Item: She can knit. [...] Item: She can wash and scour. [...] Item: She can spin. [...] Item: She has many nameless virtues. [...] Her vices. Item: She is not to be kissed fasting, in respect of her breath. [...] Item: She has a sweet mouth. [...] Item: She doth talk in her sleep. [...] Item: She is slow in words. [...] Item: She is proud. [...] Item: She hath no teeth. [...] Item: She is curst. [...] Item: She will often praise her liquor. [...] Item: She is too liberal. [...] Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults. [...] Item: She hath more hair than wit, [...] and more faults than hairs, [...] and more wealth than faults. [...]""

Each item is read by Speed and is vastly commented upon by Launce. It is in a way the portrait of a standard woman in Elizabethan society. We have to think of course that in 1590-91 the Queen of England was Elizabeth I and any allusion to the fate of women was an allusion to the Queen who must have had some fair sense of humor to take all the more or less sarcastic remarks on the stage, and at times in the Court since she often invited the companies for court performances, which is by the way alluded too in many plays by Shakespeare who adored having plays in the play and these plays were always in front of kings, dukes or whatever other princes.

It is that level we have lost in our reading of Shakespeare and this production is typical of our modernity by having a fair presence of musicians and songs for the sake of entertainment, beauty and tempo, and of course a setting that oscillates between some Italian fantastic chateau and some dark nightly forest with ""the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar"" roaming around and a band of runaway castaway outlaws who will be pardoned at the end of the play. We could thus analyze all the allusions to Shakespeare's society and find out that the play and all its poetic charm and humoristic fun is also a slightly satirical and slightly caustic reflection of the society of his time and the history of England, probably to the utmost pleasure of Skakespeare's audience.
