I have been looking for some preschool learning dvd's for a while. Everything I had found was just filled with so much extra noneducational fluff and most of them were cartoons. My kids have never been interested in cartoons for some reason, so any cartoon is a turn off for them. This, however is just watching Heidi doing actions that go with the songs she is singing about each letter. The whole time she is singing you can watch how to wright the letter in the upper left hand corner. Each song describes what the letter looks like and the sound it makes. So if you know the 'b' song and the 'd' song it can help when your child writes it out because the songs describe when to put the stick (line) for the 'b' and 'd' so they don't get them mixed up.

My son has a hard time sitting still, and with this he can run around, sing the songs and still be learning- you gotta love that! If I would have known how much my kids (and I) would like this I would have bought the printable worksheets that can come with this as well.

My son came up to me and showed me his cup. he said does this start with the 'c' sound. He already was some what aware of most of the letter sounds, but not to the point that he could hear it in words- unless he had it memorized already from me telling him what it started with. I have only played this for my 2 and 4 year old 3 times.  These dvd's have already accelerated my children's learning in just 3 days! This even helps with there speech. One of my children has had a hard time pronouncing the 's' sound in words so watching Heidi's mouth when she sings the 's' song and singing it with her has already helped with this.

I also purchased the Jumpin Numbers & Shakin Shapes, and the Jumpin Numbers 11-30. I love all of them, they are straight forward and to the point. Heidi Butkus is amazing, I can't believe I had never heard of her before- I am so grateful that this came up when I did a search for preschool dvd's- what a fun way to learn letter sounds.",1376870400,9,2070,4.126550868486352

5687847,5,B00C2AUE7K,"My two year old asks me several times a day for his songs. He loves to dance with them our just sit and soak them in his cute little brain. He points out the letters he knows as they come on the screen and asks for the ""O"" song in particular. He also likes to call out the color on the back ground. The songs are short but catchy and fun to listen to. She does a great job at coming up with relevent words and actions to go with each letter to help the kids remember letter sounds and how to write or recognize them. Since my boy is my oldest I imagine we will be enjoying this DVD for a long time. I like how it introduces both the capital and lowercase letters, how to write it, and the letter sound in one easy song and the alphabet song is a great way to get the kids moving.",1409011200,,779,3.875
5687848,4,B00C2AUE7K,"I bought this for two of my grandchildren who are learning their letters and sounds.  When I watched it, I decided I will probably need another one for use in my preschool classroom this year.",1404950400,,192,4.485714285714286
5687849,3,B00C2AUE7K,I got this dvd for my 5 year old and 1 year old. I had them watch it and they only make it half way through the dvd before they are done. It is cute but super long for little kids.,1397692800,,180,3.4146341463414633
5687850,5,B00C2AUE7K,My class loves learning their ABC's with this fun and interactive DVD! I will use it every year in my class!,1394582400,,108,4.190476190476191

8576460,1,B00C2AUE7K,"So i bought this and received a DVD with the same songs that are posted on youtube, but the video looked nothing like it.  There are no animations or other performers,  only Heidi and a rather plain background. I'm returning this product.",1476748800,,238,4.642857142857143
8576461,3,B00C2AUE7K,There were skips in the video. I had to clean the cd and it seems to be ok now.,1469404800,,79,3.210526315789474
8576462,5,B00C2AUE7K,My students love learning their letters through movement and song! Studies show students retain better when moving and this plays right into those studies. I'm already seeing a difference in their sound knowledge after using for a couple of weeks.,1457049600,,247,5.2
8576463,4,B00C2AUE7K,My 18mth old absolutely love songs and enjoys singing and dancing along. I think it was a great way to introduce letter and phonemic awareness and goes well with my way of introducing letters using letter sounds first.,1456444800,,218,4.7631578947368425
8576464,3,B00C2AUE7K,"I was really hoping to be able to give this a five star rating, however, my 3 year old who is a very visual learner and loves these types of DVDs has yet to sit through even half of it. Not only does it not hold her attention, but my K-1 class of 8 children were not even slightly interested in it. I will probably keep trying to introduce it in short intervals and see if they become interested. I think the concept is great....it shows the proper letter formation in the top left corner, complete body movements in the right corner, words at the bottom, includes lots of color, and catchy tunes...good overall but apparently not the right fit for my kiddos.",1454544000,,659,4.365853658536586
8576465,5,B00C2AUE7K,I love Heidi's Songs. The DVDs are fantastic and a fun way to learn the alphabet.,1453075200,,81,4.125
