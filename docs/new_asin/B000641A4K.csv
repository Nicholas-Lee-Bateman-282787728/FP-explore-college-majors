8038024,4,B000641A4K,"I have just completed watching Angel Tales for the SECOND time through; I usually do this before making up my mind about a series.  I've also read many of the other online reviews.  I find that most of the problem with this series is its English-speaking release format.  It's treated by Bandai as if this is complete and is a regular series of some kind.  Of course it IS, but not exactly like it's presented here:  This is only the first of TWO ( admittedly VERY short ) seasons; that's why the end seems so unfulfilling and open-ended.

When I first watched it, I was very confused by all the girls and had a great deal of trouble keeping them apart and remembering their names and characters.  This time though, everything fell right into place, and I realized that each of the 12 have quite well-defined and very cute characters.  And each gets at least one moment in the spotlight to shine.  ( Only Mika the Rabbit began to REALLY get on my nerves; and that's part of HER character and function. )  Of course some are more important than others, and I really grew attached to Ran the Goldfish, Tsubasa the Parakeet, Ayumi the Turtle, and even Tamami the Cat.

Those who found Angel Tales ""creepy"" because it dealt with the spirits of now-dead pets; or dimiss it as a ""typical"" harem anime where each girl is trying to ""win"" or bed the male protagonist are totally missing the point, I think.  The feelings here are sweeter and not so obvious ( except probably in the case of Mika! ); and should be viewed in a gentler vein throughout the series.  In fact, most of the twisted humor of the accompanying hiliarous ""Venomous Tales"" that are in the extras act as a sort of satire on the innocence of the regular episodes.

All the technical aspects of these DVDs are excellent overall: sound, color, animation, etc.; pointing to what must have been a quality production.  I only wish the SECOND season were available on DVD; ""Tenshi no Shippo, Chu"" ( ""Angels With Tails, Part Two"" ) seems to only exist in Japan in original Japanese sans subtitles or dubbing.  I would have rated it even higher, but for its essentially unfinished nature as it stands.  I would really like to have seen more of Goro, the Girls, and the Saint Beasts; and find out what REALLY happens!",1217376000,,2268,4.519607843137255
8038025,4,B000641A4K,"If you've gotten this far in the series, you must have enjoyed the other three enough as well as was curious as to how Goro was suddenly the one that was going to defend the Guardian Angels, considering (hate to say it..) the weakest defense of a master ever seen in an anime. (If there's worse it'll make the Angels feel better.. =^^=)

Considering they were fighting the Four Saint Beasts themselves, and with four of their own under the Beast's control (gotta love the chinese look of the attire the four captured Angels were 'put' in.) ..and considering that the rest of the Angels were just 'about' to get killed defending their master (though more likely just knocked out..) one had to wonder at the end of Vol. 3 what the heck Goro was thinking.

That's what makes the very start of Vol. 4 a bit disconcerting. There's no pause, and as soon as episode begins, they literaly get into it. By the time the episode ends, 'all' the answers are laid on the table, ones that shocks the Saint Beasts and Angels alike. And for 'once' in a mass harem anime, the main guy 'is' a real hero. Heck, it all looks wierd to watch a bland human suddenly demonstrate 'prowess' that even suprised the Goddess by the time all is said and done. The how and why are also explained pretty effectively in this reviewer's opinion.

In the end, Goro is a man that is looked on with utter reverance by the spirit beings present, though if a bit unsettling, as mentioned, to watch. And for the uninitiated, the very end is a bit of a suprise. As a fan that has seen many anime, I should have known better, but was still taken off guard enough by the ending of the episode. In all, the episode was done decently enough to give it my nod as the series best episode.

That was until the next episodes, ones that shows a deeper consequence of the relationships between the Angels and their Master. The series sorta comes full circle as Goro is called back to see his parents, and the girls tag along, using their plushie doll powers to help Goro avoid a BIG train fare. The result is a comic treat.

The last two episodes are linked, and we see of all things, the Angels are forced come to terms, and for others, conspire to end, a chance match making event by Goro's mother. It also shows acceptance by Goro's father with the changes in Goro's life.

But the big catch is when one of the Angel's own 'real' human versions suddenly show up, being revealed as Goro's childhood love. (..and I'm not telling who unless it's been seen.) Eventually all the hijinks and emotional rabble rousing comes to a pointant end, as the double of the certain Angel (actual person to clarify further, verses the double form that the Angel took..) has to come to terms of her 'own', and makes for a feel of an open ended ending for the series at this point.

Over all, the entire series, while indeed a rehash of the old harem theme, to this reviewer at least, is a prefered title for my otaku shelf. Trust me, there's 'far' worse to watch than this series, though far 'better' too. In all, Angel Tales was well done enough to warrant saying that it's worth the purchase price. If nothing else the entire series of Venomous Tales is 'far' more halarious to watch, and probably is the part that makes the series worth collecting.

Angel Tales is a good decent series to watch. Just watch it with a open mind. If you're not into this type anime, no amount of a review is going to save your opinin anyway, and this anime is more for those that want a cute series with a bit of pointancy to it.",1116374400,6,3546,4.386605783866058
