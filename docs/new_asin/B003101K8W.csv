8386436,5,B003101K8W,"I love getting to see ""dance"" scenes from old egyptian movies.  I have had a hard time finding the full movies but now I have some titles and actresses to look for.

The scenes are well preserved and have better sound that most of the 70s and 80s stuff!  If you're a bellydance geek/dork like me you will enjoy this just as much as picking up and IAMED performance video.",1303689600,,371,4.271428571428571
