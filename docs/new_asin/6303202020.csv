594271,5,6303202020,"While not my favorite of Kurosawa's work Red Beard is THE best picture I have ever seen on human compassion.  The story line trails out in several directions at times early on - mostly with the patients recollections of their personal tragedies - but admittidly the emotions of those stories are part of the films strength.  Also the story of an arrogant young doctor stuck in helping the poor and sickest of all people comes off not only as a great tale of truth in helping the unfortunate but also an even more truthful tale of how life puts you in unlikely, and sometimes unwanted, situations that turn out to make ones life and others lives worth living.",972172800,8,658,4.567796610169491
594272,5,6303202020,this was one of the best japanesse movies that i have ever watched.  The story line is catchy and engulfs you the moment you start the movie...this  is one of those movies that even if you don't like subtitles you are  entranced to keep going.  This movie shows you what life was really like in  japan at the turn of the century.  i would suggest this movie...it is even  better than seven samuri.,966988800,4,397,4.3561643835616435

594398,5,6303202020,"RED BEARD is an emotionally breathtaking film...certainly one of Kurosawa's most moving. BUT - I would advise waiting for Criterion's NEXT edition of it. Virtually all of Kurosawa's other major films were first released in nicely restored prints with a minimum of Special Features. Later Criterion re-releases the film with a surfeit of new Special Features, prompting serious fans of the film to effectively buy it twice. [ I just replaced my bare-bones original Criterion copy of  HIDDEN FORTRESS with their latest edition with many Special Feature extras! I couldn't resist!]  No doubt RED BEARD will eventually be re-released in an equally sumptuous new edition. The present Criterion is fine is you just want to see the film, but the single Commentary provided is focuses almost entirely on the most  technical aspects of film (what camera lenses were used, the use of zoom shots and pans, etc.). There is very little in the Commentary about the story or the history of the film. I found it virtually useless.",1405900800,3,1014,5.023809523809524

594402,5,6303202020,"I'm a huge Kurosawa fan.  I've seen Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, Ikiru, Sanshuro Sugata, Sanshuro Sugata II, and The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail.  Of all of those movies, Red Beard ties Seven Samurai as my favorite Kurosawa work.

The plot involves a young doctor, Noboru Yasumoto, who wants to become a personal physician to the Shogunate himself, ending up at a clinic in an impoverished rural area.  Upset at being transferred there, he stubbornly resists his new assignment under the head physician Dr Niide, whom everyone refers to as ""Red Beard"".  As the movie progresses, Yasumoto comes to accept his circumstances and find fulfillment in helping people at the clinic.

The movie does a great job exploring its themes.  One is the relationship between hardship and sickness.  A lot of people are made sick (or their sicknesses made worse) because of their poverty or other severe problems they have in their lives.  One of the patients, for instance, has his story explored in depth to show how internalizing problems from the past can eat away at you as time goes on.  Another one shows how unhealthy strained family relationships can be.  Poverty plays an especially prominent theme, as the movie makes it obvious that a lot of these people wouldn't have these health issues if they lived in a more upscale place or had more money to afford treatment.

About halfway into the movie, Red Beard and Yasumoto go to a brothel and end up rescuing a young girl who was being used as a child prostitute.  Her healing is much more psychological than physical, and part of it involves her and Yasumoto becoming attached.  Watching them bond is touching and brings a lot of warmth to a movie that had been very melancholy up until that point.  Eventually, after she has healed, she begins helping others as well.

Two of Kurosawa's favorite ideas, existentialism and humanism, are in prominent display in this film.  Existentialism, in that everyone finds a purpose that keeps them driving forward.  For Yasumoto, is purpose changes from selfishness to selflessness; Red Beard, of course, consistently shows selflessness.  Through helping their patients they finding meaning in their own lives.  Humanism, meanwhile, is shown through the power that we have to both create and solve problems as human beings.  People, in all of their glory and shame, at their most and least beautiful, are what drive this movie forward.

Speaking of moving forward, the pacing of this movie is slow, but engaging and intimate in a way that never has you checking your watch.  This isn't a plot driven movie but a character driven one; therefore, each scene is a measured, deliberate exploration of very human characters and their interactions.  Everything is done so well, you will find yourself sucked into the scene despite the calm, steady pacing that seems slow by today's standards.

The movie is easily one of Kurosawa's best, and personally one of my favorite movies ever made.  It may not be for everyone, but if everything you've read so far makes it sound promising, check it out.  You won't be disappointed.",1393804800,8,3110,4.9193857965451055
594403,5,6303202020,"Red Beard was my introduction to Japanese film, and it was a good place to start.  Because I was impressed with it, I tried showing
it to my students, pointing out that the theme of learning about the world when one comes from an affluent background.

Instead, a snap-shot depiction of the post samurai period (Japan is now well into end-to-end unification with little/zero need for inter-fiefdom combatants) and the evolution of sword swinger into the merchant (including medical) and political class(es).

594466,3,6303202020,"The first 45 minutes of the film make it a masterpiece, especially the insane woman and surgery scenes, but then it kinda falls apart. Kurosawa the moralist defeats Kurosawa the realist, presenting a collection of moralistic tales so melodramatic that it ceases to be believable altogether.

594469,5,6303202020,"Don't bother listening to the commentary - the reviewer does NOT get this. You will see a doctor (played wonderfully by Toshiro Mifune) and his staff go from, ""Eh, other women are fine after being raped - what's her problem?"" to ""This child's brain has been scalded."" The film was made as Japan was waking up to its culture of female subjugation - as America is waking up to dealing with its own rape culture, in and out of the military. When the doctors begin to save women, the women have a chance to save others, and will, if given the chance, and somebody listens. Even a bunch of snarky old cooks will go into full battle mode to save a child from a horrible slave fate - while Mifune stands back with his mouth open. Not all children or families are saved, but a start has been made. A powerful comment on his times, as all Kurosawa's films are.

594472,3,6303202020,"This movie opens with a view of the roofs of medieval Japanese houses and this may be its high point.  It shows that both Kurosawa and Mifune do best in samurai and detective stories.  It is amazing that this movie took longer to film than Seven Samurai but accomplished so much less.

The story is set in late medieval Japan and features a young doctor from an important background.  He is fresh out of medical school and is assigned to a rural clinic which treats poor people and is run by Red Beard.  He first detests his job but later realizes the value of his real-world experience and accepts his position.

All of this is developed in the first half before the intermission.  The second half then repeats this theme featuring a young girl who is a patient.  The book the movie is based on did not include this girl and now we know why.  Adding her story to the movie has made it reach melodramatic levels.  The movie lasts 185 minutes but should be half that length.

Here Mifune plays Red Beard the doctor and it doesn't come off as well as when he plays a samurai or detective.  He seems too fierce to be a doctor and there is one scene where he beats up a group of hooligans which is better suited to one of his samurai stories.  The best scene is where Red Beard visits an ailing aristocrat whose ailments seem more suited to the 21st century.",1362268800,3,1354,4.346613545816733

594474,5,6303202020,Red Beard. The final collaboration between Kurosawa and Mifune. This film clocks in at a hefty 3 hours. I never felt like it dragged. Kurosawa has to have been one of the bravest directors ever. He was not afraid to let a scene play out; develop fully and keep the audiences' attention. He surrounded himself with the finest of the Japanese actors; and his innate ability to draw the finest from them was unsurpassed. The humanity of Red Beard is striking and anyone who is a fan of Kurosawa must view this film. Highly Recommended.,1358899200,3,532,4.610526315789474
594556,5,6303202020,"I came to this film late in life.

When I ws a young man, I was introduced to Kurosawa's more popular films -- Rashamon, Seven Samurai, Ikiru. Later, I sought out his revival films in the 1980s -- Kagemusha and Ran. Those are all great films.

I can't believe I missed Red Beard. A humanistic masteriece, I think it is the balance for Kurosawa's film The Bad Sleep Well. In that earlier film which like this one, stars Mifume) makes the very familar point that evil begets evil (the film is far more textured than that, but that is a major theme). Red Beard balanced that with the less familar argument that good begets good. The arrogant young doctor is humanized by Red Beard. In turn, his kindness to the 12-year-old abused girl rescued from the brothel (in a comic fight sequence) leads to her fight to save the life of the seven-year-old thief whose family has tried to commit mass suicide.

Of course, this is all oversimplification of a richly textured film. It's also beautifully shot. There is a scene when the young doctor and the ailing girl have been shut up together in a small, claustrophobic room for almost 20 minutes of screen time and she slides a window open to reveal a beautiful snow falling -- it take your breath away. The penultimate shot of the washer women looking for the well(and the single tear that follows the cameron down) is astonishing.

This film lasts three hours and when it's over, you wish it would last three hours longer.

Kurosawa worked in a number of genres -- his historical samurai films (Seven Samurai, throne of Blood, Kagemusha, Hidden Fortness, Ran) are justly famous. So are his hard-boiled modern day crime dramas (Drunken Angel, Stray Dog, High and Low, The Bad Sleep Well).

But I see a string of optimistic, humanistic dramas running through his word -- from the early One Wonderful Sunday to Ikiru to Red Beard. I always thought Ikiru was his masterpiece, but now I'm not so sure I wouldn't choose Red Beard.",1346889600,4,1964,4.629310344827586
594557,5,6303202020,"Top notch acting, story, and direction.  This is movie is just good.  That's all there is to it. If you like Mifune or Akira you'll love this one.",1344124800,,146,4.178571428571429
594558,5,6303202020,"One of many peaks in Kurosawa's career....unfortunately, this one ended his long association with Toshiro Mifune and almost destroyed his career....this is one off the greatest films ever made....anywhere....

594559,5,6303202020,"This film is easily viewed as a soap, abit boring if you watch the whole thing in one setting but quite pleasant watching it's sleepy sentimental story over extended viewings when in the mood for nothing too taxing.

The story itself can be a little bit ridiculous at times in it's execution of narrative juxtapositions involving the righteous Doctor Red Beard's sanctuary of holistic medicine against a corrupt outside world, but viewed in the way of a soap, it is an enjoyable & interesting, if odd ball, film with a high level of classic black & white 60's film craftsmanship to take in.

It is a character type of story, and the overall story doesn't really go anywhere, being just different episodes of mis-fortune and sympathy of the downtrodden & marginalised, which is the daily diet of life in the public service medical clinic.

The film's nice charm is simply about the power or merits of personal kindness in a cruel world; but the unlayered simple tone of it's message also takes abit away from it's authenticity in being an emotively character involving film, Red Beard in particular not being more than an iconic character in believability despite being the moral & heroic anchor for the film.

I get the feeling that this film in combination with Ikiru, rounds out an somewhat philosophical & ideological conclusion to a position held in Kurosawa's thoughts & conceptions of human nature & resulting societal justice/injustice issues at the time.",1326844800,,1462,4.930894308943089

594563,3,6303202020,"I very much wanted to enjoy this film, and perhaps because my expectations were so high, the experience was so disappointing. I have seen almost all Kurosawa's surviving films and this one, in my estimation, falls in the bottom half of his oeuvre for quality. And yet, it contains powerful elements which still make it worth seeing. There is a strange imbalance between the unsatisfactory performances of the two main characters and trite overall storyline of master-taming-arrogant-pupil, on the one hand, and the impassioned acting of secondary characters and genuine pathos achieved in passing vignettes. Mifune gives a one-dimensional performance as the eponymous Red Beard: master-doctor and life-guru. When the film is centred on him it seems pompous. Red Beard's protege, Dr Yasumoto, is a character with more scope, but the actor playing it, Yuzo Kayama - chosen, one suspects, because of his looks and box-office appeal rather than acting ability - is not up to the demands of the part. He has a small palette of expressions: bewilderment, anger and a stare into space during scenes when he sits at the edge of the action. The fact that the film overcomes these weaknesses, to the extent that it does, is something of a marvel. It is wholly because of the extraordinary performances of the secondary players, especially Terumi Niki, Kyoko Kagawa, Yoshitaka Zushi and Akemi Negishi.

The DVD is a highly restored transfer. Whatever ""patina"" Donald Richie saw and enjoyed about the image has gone: the film has been restored to within an inch of its life. But these things are always a trade-off, so no big deal. Richie's useful, albeit brief, notes describe the enormous care that was taken with set design and authenticity in achieving a late-Tokugawa ""look"", and also how Kurosawa made only fractional use of the vast set he created.  The film, paradoxically, often looks like a stage production, with its stylised prop placements and side lighting, rather than a ""location"" film. Authenticity and historical detail are not values that come through. Indeed, although its running time and story type would imply an epic style of film-making, in fact it is more a collection of closely-observed vignettes. This is exemplified by a long recollection sequence - a story told by a dying patient - that involves neither of the main characters and almost sits outside the film.

There is a commentary track on this DVD but no other substantial extras.",1297814400,9,2454,5.054320987654321
594564,5,6303202020,"I guess I really need to reevaluate my feelings on Asian cinema.  I've often claimed that it is just too chaotic for my taste.  I generally prefer the slow burning dramatic tension from German films, or the jovial loveliness of French or Italian films.  As a rule, Asian films always appeared too corny for me.

It seems like I've been gaining a newfound education on the subject, and I'm liking what I'm learning.

TCM was running a marathon of director Akira Kurosawa's work and I was fortunate enough to catch a few of his films.  `Akahige' (or `Red Beard') is currently my favorite.  Kurosawa was a genius director.  His work surely speaks for itself, and he has single handedly helped my appreciation for Asian cinema to grow and grow.  What I really love about his work is that he was able to embody the style of the Asian cinema while maintaining a solidified vision, unique to his own personal aesthetic.  His films are undeniably his films.  I also appreciate that he understands subtlety, something that I look for in a film.

`Akahige' is all about subtlety.

The film centers around a small clinic that is run by Dr. Kyojo Niide.  Niide, known to his employees and patients as Red Beard, is not easily understood.  In fact, he is sorely misunderstood by quite a few, including his newest doctor, Dr. Noboru Yasumoto.  Yasumoto obviously has his own problems, but the one that is most apparent on the outset is his pride.  Feeling as though he is entitled to more, Yasumoto continually rebels against Niide's instructions, hoping to be sent away.  Instead, thanks to Niide's patience and sincerity, Yasumoto learns the true meaning of his profession.

The film is littered with outstanding performance, the truest highlight being a brutally honest performance given by the film's star, Toshiro Mifune.  Watching the layers strip away as he continues to impart wisdom to Yasumoto is just stunning.

As far as a technical achievement, one doesn't get much better than `Akahige'.  The direction is simply stunning, and the set pieces and costumes are authentic and captivating.  The rich black and white cinematography is stunning to watch.  In fact, this whole film comes together effortlessly, with strength and commanding presence.

But, like any good film, it all lies within the script, which is compelling, poignant and engaging.  The film is never dull or meandering, but always rich in detail and holds the audiences interest with ease.  You become so invested in these characters as they mold and conform, becoming swallowed up in the situations leading to their growth as individuals.  Human kindness and understanding is on full display as Yasumoto observes Niide and begins to understand who he is and why he does what he does.  This discovery makes `Akahige' on of the most beautifully sincere and films of the 60's (or ever).

As you can probably tell, I highly recommend you set aside the three hours it takes to watch this masterpiece.",1271376000,3,2959,4.907258064516129
594565,5,6303202020,"This version of Red Beard is the best one by far.
 There is a bootleg copy of this DVD going around that I got sucked into,
and bought. I thought I was just getting a real good deal over the internet,
but I got stung.
The bootleg version sub titles are way off,and the video isn't very good either.
It comes out of China and exept for the title, only has Chinese writting on the cover.
  This version ,that says Criterion Collection is what you want to get.
The video is clear and the subtitle translation is spot on!
The movie itself is more of a statement on ""the human condition"",more than the tipical Mifune ""action""genre.
 Like other great actors, and directors ,they have all there freinds in the movie again. If youve seen 7 Samurai,Yojimbo,and Sanjuro ,you'll recognize all the co-stars. There is one fight seen however(after all its a Mifune flick)thats great!!

594623,5,6303202020,"Professional Amazon reviewer gets it wrong. Red Beard bears direct resemblance to Kurosawa's 1949 film, The Quiet Duel, and is not an ""unlikely addition"" at all.

In many ways Quiet Duel is the more modern film than Red Beard with its finely-drawn moral complexities. Quiet Duel sticks in my head in a way Red Beard, with all of its moral absolutes, does not.",1256515200,,359,4.698412698412699
594624,5,6303202020,"Though Seven Samurai is generally proclaimed as his best, for me Red Beard surpasses it.  It deals more with character than story (or stories in this case) and the development and growth of those characters.  It is set in and around a clinic and focuses on staff and patients, especially the poor.  I found it beautiful and thought provoking.

As an aside, it mirrors health care in 21st century America.",1244937600,2,404,4.728571428571429
594625,5,6303202020,"Akahige (""Red Beard"") is easy to overlook because it is not a Kurosawa ""samurai film"" like his more popular ""Seven Samurai"", ""Sanjuuroh"", ""Yohjimboh"", etc. While Mifune plays a tough character, he has no cut-'em-up action scenes as in ""Sanjuuroh"" or ""Samurai Rebellion.""

What makes this film worth the three-hour running time? While it can run perilously close to schmaltz when dealing with the sad condition of the poor patients, the story is fundamentally compelling. It begins with Yasumoto, a cocky graduate of a Dutch medical school in Nagasaki, going to an interview at Dr. Niide's clinic for the poor. The doctor he is to replace leads him on a tour of the facilities and paints a grim picture of the clinic and Dr. Niide himself, a purported tyrannical dictator called ""Akahige"" (literally Red Beard). Yasumoto takes this at face value, and he voices his disgust at the rank odor his guide tells him is the smell of the poor (""They smell like rotten fruit""). As the story unfolds we see that Yasumoto is a self-pitying spoiled brat. He has just suffered the heartbreak of being jilted by the daughter of the prominent Nomura family with ties to the Shogunate. He thinks he was sent to the clinic by the Nomura family to silence him and hide the shame of the broken engagement from public. Yasumoto suspects Akahige's interest in his notes on Western medicine is an attempt to steal his medical secrets. He decides he will behave so badly that Akahige will send him away, and only then will he be able to pursue his dream of becoming the Shogun's physician. He intentionally disobeys the strict orders to wear the clinic uniform, abstain from alcohol, and to work diligently to ease the tremendous burden of cases born by his colleague, Dr. Mori, and Akahige.

As the story progresses Yasumoto learns that things are not as they seemed, and he grows up as he learns to take his eyes off his own suffering and to look to the needs of others. Akahige does not upbraid him as he expected, and the so-called tyrant even saves Yasumoto's life when he is nearly entrapped by a psychotic beauty who temporarily escaped confinement at the clinic. Yasumoto's first house call with Akahige to a brothel yields his first patient, a 12-year old girl being forced into prostitution by the old madame. His job to help heal the physical and psychological condition of the girl is more than the young doctor can handle, and he cries tears of frustration that his patient won't accept his help. He marvels at the patience shown by the seemingly stoic Akahige, and the latter's compassion for the sick begins to grow on him. He decides to shed his sword and fine clothes (marks of his superior rank), wear the clinic uniform and perform his duties alongside Akahige and Mori.

Yasumoto dives into his work to the point of exhaustion, and now Akahige prescribes Yasumoto's care to his patient. The girl heals as she abandons her cynical caution and practices on-gaeshi (repayment of kindness out of gratitude). The formerly high and mighty young doctor is now in the position of having to rely on the care of a poor, dirty girl in tattered clothes. (Akahige mutters ""ase-kusai"" [""it reeks of sweat in here""] when his visits Yasumoto's room, and it reminds us that the cocky Yasumoto remarked at how the poor patients stunk when he first arrived at the clinic.) Both learn to accept each other's help in healing.

Yasumoto also learns that he was not a victim of injustice as he'd thought. He was not sent to the clinic as punishment or as a trick by the Nomura family to keep him quiet. On the contrary, they were working to get him appointed as the Shogun's doctor. Not only that, the family rejected the daughter who jilted him because they took the engagement as seriously as he did. His former fiancee's younger sister offers herself to be Yasumoto's wife to preserve the family honor and allow her sister back into the fold. Now that he is no longer a self-centered victim but both the giver and receiver of gracious treatment, Yasumoto determines to stay at the clinic and work for the betterment of the poor rather than take the path to fame and fortune with the Shogunate. Akahige calls him a fool for throwing away his opportunity for a better life, but Yasumoto shows he can be as headstrong as his mentor in his determination to do good.

I first rented this film on VHS over 15 years ago, and I was impressed with the quality of the Criterion Collection restoration. The sound and picture quality are excellent. This is the edition to own.",1234742400,4,4540,4.70566037735849

And sometimes unpleasant.  If you're a completist you probably should watch it, but if you are just looking for a good flick, go with one of the more famous Kurosawa works (Seven Samurai - my favorite, Rashomon - truly a classic, Kagemusha, Ran, Hidden Fortress, Dreams, Rhapsody in August, Ikiru ... ).",1234310400,4,466,4.523809523809524
594627,5,6303202020,"It is difficult to imagine that a western audience would find the story of a 19th Century Japanese doctor working at a public clinic interesting--and yet, as he does in so many other films, director Akira Kurosawa transcends the cultural divide between east and west with considerable grace.  The 1965 RED BEARD, his final film with signature actor Toshir Mifune, is subtle, beautiful, and exceptionally memorable.

RED BEARD focuses on the relationship between Dr. Kyojio ""Red Beard"" Niide (Mifune) and Dr. Noboru Yasumoto (Yuzo Kayama), a newly trained doctor who considers his appointment to Niide's public clinic a fate worse than death.  Although Yasumoto initially resists Niide, he develops a gruding respect--and then ultimately a deeper understanding of both himself and his profession.  Although this theme runs throughout the film, the events that transform Yasumoto are extremely episodic: a sudden surgery, deaths and deathbed confessions, a horrendously abused child, and his own sudden illness which has the effect of demonstrating he is not immune to the chance horrors of the world.

As is inevitably the case in a Kurasowa film, the cinematography--here by Asaichi Nakai and Takao Sait--is both astonishing and subtle; Masaru Sat's music, which has a distinctly European quality is also remarkable and exceptionally well used.  Indeed, every detail of production value is remarkably, flawlessly rendered.  The Criterion Collection offers a beautiful transfer and includes a scholarly audio track that places RED BEARD within the context of Kurosawa's overall career and is also well-worth a listen.  While I cannot imagine RED BEARD will ever rival the likes of THE SEVEN SAMURAI in popularity, it is a truly fine film, and I strongly recommend it.

This is NOT really a samurai movie in the accepted Western sense, although Mifune does beat the hell out of a group of baddies in more or less typical Mifune fashion, and also typically, voices regret for having done so!

594630,5,6303202020,"When critics and film buffs talk about the legendary Akira Kurosawa, they usually focus on how he influenced American cinema, or his deep philosophical undertones.  While those topics merit discussion (and books), I think those same critics and film buffs forget to mention just how entertaining Kurosawa was.  You can spend months dissecting each brilliant camera shot and subtle ideals, but what about those precious hours where all you have to do is watch the screen?  To appreciate Akira Kurosawa's impact on cinema requires you to believe a very simple truth: ""There is more than one way to be excited, to be moved, and to be entertained.""

If you can accept that principle and are ready to challenge your moviegoing senses, then the work of Kurosawa will possibly change your life as it has mine.  I'm not gonna call Kurosawa the greatest filmmaker who ever lived, because a couple of his pieces (particularly his latest work) just don't do it for me.  But I will say that when the Japanese legend managed to reach me, no other filmmaker inspired me more as a person.  My favorite example is RED BEARD, a very gentle and uplifting story of loyalty, maturity, friendship, and hundreds of other synonyms I could throw at you.

During the opening credits, you think you know what you're getting into.  The gentle music, the peaceful shots of calm rooftops, the sounds of nature...at the outset, you're right.  RED BEARD begins as sentimental as its musical score implies.  The peaceful tone continues as we're introduced to the young Dr. Yasumoto, a brilliant intern who instead of being sent to practice at a prestigous government office, is assigned to a poor village.  Yasumoto is to work under Dr. Niide, a man who's basically the mentor we all wish we could have.  Niide (aka ""Red Beard"") is firm, wise, strong, and patient.  RED BEARD's main story is Yasumoto's appreciation for life and humility.

Of course, like any great film, RED BEARD gradually reveals layer after layer, theme after theme, character after character, & brilliant scene after brilliant scene.  What I want to make clear is that RED BEARD isn't just a character drama.  It's a jack-of-all-trades.  There are several harrowing scenes where the doctors have to treat patients, none of them excessive or overly grotesque.  The story is romantic, but in a believable and respectable way.  There are even a few scenes of violence: one a suspenseful attack, the other an unexpected fight sequence.  I promise you that while the choregraphy of the violence is thrilling, the aftermath to each is even more of pleasure to watch.  RED BEARD also briefly addresses issues like class politics and domestic values.

Kurosawa often explored the different classes in his films, but in most of his samurai films, he was incredibly cynical about the tension between them.  Contrary to American sociology, the lower class is often reviled more in his films than the upper class.  Although no character in a Kurosawa flick was perfect, we often sympathized with the stronger protagonists, rather than the weaker subordinates.  Another Kurosawa norm is the ""overacting""; detractors sometimes can't get into Kurosawa's films because the actors seem to 'speak' their emotions rather than 'perform' their behavior.

RED BEARD breaks these traditions.  The performances are more grounded and less theatrical.  The tone is generally light; the tunnel never gets dark without a light at the end of it.  And frankly, I don't think I've ever been more moved by a story in my entire life.  There's a perfectly-executed sequence in the middle act, where two souls heal each other in the most unusual way.  To give away the rest would be unfair to you, but even if you read the entire plot, RED BEARD wouldn't be any better or worse for you.

Most of RED BEARD's detractors focus on its time length.  The film is 185 minutes long.  It might be a few minutes too long, but then again there's no such thing as a perfect film.  Kurosawa isn't in any hurry to tell his story, but that doesn't mean he didn't pace himself.  If everything I've read about Kurosawa's techniques is true - and I believe they are - no filmmaker showed more discipline to his craft than Kurosawa.  Even respected greats like Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, and Sidney Lumet would tell you no other filmmaker was more dedicated or selective with his style.  There are thousands of classics with worse flaws; RED BEARD's flaws are literally a matter of minutes.

The Criterion DVD includes only two extras.  First is a theatrical trailer, which honestly isn't anything special other than a peek at 1960s movie marketting.  But the other bonus - and I do mean BONUS - is a stunning feature-length commentary track by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince.  I've listened to this man speak on 6 Kurosawa films' DVDs, and this is just as great as his other tracks.  He analyzes shot sequences, historical background, behind-the-scenes issues, scene composition, philosophy, & hundreds of other factoids I can't remember.  Prince talks endlessly throughout the film, but not because he loves the sound of his own voice.  He keeps speaking because he knows that 185 minutes isn't enough time to do RED BEARD justive.  Simply put, Stephen Prince knows how to turn a skeptic into a believer.  Trust me, I've walked away lukewarm from a couple Kurosawa ""classics"", only to have Prince challenge my criticisms.

RED BEARD's plot description doesn't look like much on the surface, but no summary does any film justice.  What should persuade you to check out RED BEARD is how it's inspired and moved the curious few who've watched it.  The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) reports only 3000+ voters have scored this film; the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films have over 100,000 votes each.  It's lost masterpieces like RED BEARD that the Criterion Collection exists.

Criterion sometimes releases works of art that only the most educated cryptologists and historians can apprecate --- RED BEARD is not one of them.  Even though it's in black-and-white with subtitles, it's as commerical and accessible as any true classic.  I'm convinced you will walk away from this film a better human being.",1212969600,8,6192,4.9476744186046515

594632,4,6303202020,"I didn't check the running time of ""Red Beard"" before watching it.  At a point I though might be the end, I was surprized to see ""Intermission"" pop up on the screen.  This movie runs just over 3 hours and there really isn't a reason for any more than the standard 2 hour length.  If it had kept within those confines, this would likely merit 5 stars from me as well.  However, when you take too long to make a point...well, maybe I'd better move on to something else myself.

What makes ""Red Beard"" the (near)great movie that it is comes from the evolving humane compassion it displays.  A young doctor finds himself assigned to some charity clinic instead of the job he was expecting as the personal physician to some big shot  Shogun.  We can figure out right away what direction the movie will take but it is still a joy in watching it develop (except that it dragged out so...but wait, we weren't going to talk about that anymore).  The title character is played by Toshiro Mifune but he may have been asked to do too much.  There is an unnecessary (there I go again) scene that seems meant for a samurai movie (which, of course, Kurosawa knowa how to make).

There are many different characters in the movie but the best ones, in my opinion, are the cooks who seem to be a sort of Greek chorus that measures the emotional changes that take place throughout the movie.  This really is a good movie with a master film-maker who knows how to create an emotional statement.  If he could've taken less...oh, better not get started on that again.",1200787200,4,1545,4.455516014234876

A ferrous drama that demonstrates once more the lavish genius of Kurosawa. And despite it's overlong its intrinsic virtues are disseminated in every frame of the picture. The youthful irreverence of a young doctor who pretends his knowledge belongs exclusively to him, but since the moment he enters to that clinic he will have to deal with the life and death, some issues that are not explicit in the books, slowly but progressively his initial  arrogance will decay through this life's lesson.

594723,4,6303202020,"The only down-side I have seen to this movie is the English subtitles.  They appear to have been written by a Japanese student in his or her, I'd guess, 4th year of taking ""Engrish"".  I don't wish to suggest that for a non-Japanese speaker (read, this reviewer) they are distracting.  However, I have noticed more than once that the word usements (thank you, Steve Martin) and sentence designs are somewhat awkward.  It was, I suspect,  accidental; either that or the translator was practicing some sort of verbal origami.  For example, one is left asking who is ""Brown Beard""?

That being said, please don't let the above dissuade you from watching (or owning) this movie.  I believe that most of us who are able to sit through it will come away with an appreciation of how, given the right circumstances, our personal selfish desires can change into genuine compassion.  (For you and me, however, the ""trick"" is to be in the right circumstances.  I can't help you with that.)

One further suggestion, if I may:  watch this movie by yourself and without distractions.  In that way you will have the opportunity to focus on the story & the people.  Hopefully this will allow you to ""feel"" what's happening.  You might even find yourself identifying with different aspects of different characters.  Don't expect to be entertained.

Humanistic and compassionate, the film tells the story of a young doctor who after graduation from the Dutch Medical School in Nagasaki hopes to become a member of the court medical staff but instead has to take a post as an intern at a Public Clinic for the impoverished patients. The clinic is run by Dr. Nide (Toshiro Mifune) whom the destitute patients call ""Red Beard"". The long and difficult journey awaits the young doctor - from the initial shock and denial to work at the clinic, to learning how to understand his patients, care for them s and see the humans in them. Kurosawa describes the film, one of his directorial pinnacles as a ""monument to the goodness in man"".

594725,5,6303202020,"For some reason I have always like this Toshiro Mifune character more than any of his other roles. And that is saying quite a lot, considering that this late, great legendary actor portrayed so many wonderful characters throughout his wonderful career. Just as Takashi Shimura's role in ""Ikiru"" is my favorite role with him [even though he acted in many great films] there is something about the nature of their characters in these two great Kurosawa films that humbles me. One of the reviewers wrote that they don't make films like this anymore. And he is right. And this is our loss, as well as the Film Industry's. This film is magical and a true masterpiece of cinema.

In the film, when the young and arrogant Dr. Yasumoto (Yuzo Kayama) finds that he will not be the attending physician at the Imperial Court; but instead working for the lowly peasants [in his mind] with Dr. Niide, (Toshiro Mifune) a.k.a., 'Red Beard,' he is resentful. Yet the patience that the elder Dr. Niide shows this arrogant young Doctor-to-be is one of showing, not telling. Red Beard's example as to what a physican is meant to be, not what one wishes to be, sets a great example to Dr. Yasumoto. Which in turn transforms Dr. Yasumoto into a better human being. His time spent in the company of the peasants and Dr. Niide show him that he is needed, not at the Imperial Court, but with those truly in need.

There are many films that Toshiro Mifune did in his career which I have, and without a doubt his acting abilities in many films are standout, however, this film has always been the one that I find him to be stellar in. And I have quite a few of his films. Many not so well known in the west. This film gives the viewer a lesson in humanity about what is important in life: The helping of one's fellow human being. And this is one of the reasons I have always liked this film. Truly remarkable. This film was also the last collaboration between Toshiro Mifune, and Akira Kurosawa. Nonetheless, they both left behind enough films which will always be treasured by those who admire such great works of cinema. This film is highly recommended. It is in black and white.

In the movie, an arrogant young physician, Dr. Yasumoto unwilling works in a charity clinic with Dr. Niide, a.k.a., ""Red Beard"", who is played by Toshiro Mifune in his last role in a Kurosawa film.

This film is also the last black and white movie Kurosawa shot, and is a beautiful coda to this phase of Kurosawa's work. The use of lighting in particular has great symbolic and aesthetic effect as we watch Dr. Yasumoto learn medicine and compassion under Red Beard's tutelage.

Kurosawa does not pull many punches with 19th Century medicine: we sit with the physicians as they listen to the final breaths of a dying patient and watch a woman thrash against restraints as Red Beard operates on her in an era without anesthetics. We hear stories of sexual abuse and see all the warts of human existence, but we do so with a tough compassion and charity that is profoundly stirring.

Kurosawa is not just a great director and artist, but a skilled psychologist and lover of mankind. This movie deserves to be ranked with other Kurosawa masterpieces like the Seven Samurai, Ran, and Rashomon.",1157932800,19,1294,4.687224669603524

With ""Red Beard,"" Kurosawa has tackled a subject which in past eras was coated with schmaltz, and in the current state of cinema, is avoided altogether: the nature of individual goodness in the face of want, inequality and privilege. Modern-day film makers in the West seem fearful of any emotions other than romantic desire, violent retribution or a ""hip"" self-referencing irony/ennui. Here, Mifune portrays a man who distains admiration for his own sacrifices while adhering to his own high standards of individual behavior. He's not above wheedling and even a bit of suggestive blackmail to raise funds for his clinic. In typical Mifune fashion, he manages to make a nearly saintly doctor an anti-hero who rubs almost everyone the wrong way.

The film is shot in black-and-white, and features many haunting images. Of special note is the scene in which Mifune attempts to break through the protective shell of an abandoned young girl. A young doctor has been trying to give her a spoonful of medicine; he quits after she slaps his hand away three times. Mifune takes over, and the girl continues to slap the proffered medicine away-- once, twice, trice; Mifune expresses an array of emotions in the simple act of trying once again. Finally, on the seventh attempt, the girl accepts the medicine. The quiet authenticity of this moment is rare in film.",1147737600,35,1450,4.942622950819672
594729,4,6303202020,"Red Beard was Kurosawa and Mifune's last collaboration, and it's not hard to see why the actor parted ways with his sensei even if the shoot hadn't dragged on for two years (during which time Kurosawa insisted he keep his beard, preventing him from taking other roles while allowing Takashi Shimura to cameo in a Godzilla film). Although it's not a bad film, Mifune is required more as a presence than an actor. Instead the focus is on Yuzo Kayama's arrogant young doctor furious at being assigned to a slum area hospital and his journey from pride to service.

In many ways it feels remarkably similar to The Cardinal, with even Masaru Sato's excellent score sharing much of the flavor of Jerome Moross' score for the Preminger film, albeit with a much more strident counterpoint in the final cue that stakes the films claim to militance over reverence. It's a heartfelt and humane film, but it tends to wander more towards soap opera as it moves unhurriedly to its foregone conclusion.

Through magnificent acting and superior direction, the movie captures the heart-rending trials and tribulations of these peasant people.

Three ""stories"" predominate: a totally selfless man's death-bed cenfession about his wife and his loyalty to her; a 12-year-old girl's learning that there are good people in the world; and a 7-year-old boy's family who takes poison rather than starve any longer. There is a haunting scene where women are ""calling back"" the life of a boy from a well, according to a folk belief.

Naturally, everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour.  Midway through the movie, out of nowhere, one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission.  It is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief, confusing, and brutal.

Yasumoto, the arrogant and self-absorbed young doctor, resents being sent to this backward place, but as the action unfolds he learns more about the people wo need help and more about what it means to be a doctor.  Exactly halfway through the film Yatsumo dons the robes of a clinic doctor, having decided that Red Beard is a worthy mentor.  We also learn the stories of several patients in depth, and these are heartbreaking.

Mifune is charismatic and subdued (though Kurosawa unleashes him in a fight scene at a brothel, which is a pleasure to behold), playing a quiet man with as much intensity as he plays his usual samurai roles..

Again and again, the movie is about how hidden secrets make people sick, and how the old doctor can intuit the presence of these secrets and give patients some way to relieve them.
This may be considered the deep subtext of the film, beneath the coming-of-age drama that centers on the young doctor.
The film is beautiful, strikingly directed and acted, with moments that are amazing cadenzas of acting skill, where the director allows the actors to show how much they can make out of an emotion through their body-language.
It may also appear heavy-handed and obvious at times to Western viewers, who have had a hundred years of Freudian exploration of psychosomatic medicine. But if I understand the context, Kurosawa is asking many of his Japanese viewers to consider for the first time the enormous hidden harm caused by physical and sexual abuse, extreme poverty (and extreme wealth), some uses of  traditional authority, patriarchial attitudes, the prideful identification with a dead aristocracy, government policies that punish the poor, broken and bruised hearts resulting from complicated and entangled relationships, resourcefully anti-social adaptations to oppression, and other dark shadows beneath the enameled glaze of contemporary Japanese complacency.
Forgive me if that sounds overstated. But watch for it just under the surface of the fllm, again and again, and increasingly as the film goes on. The film strikes me as a profound and profoundly sad social document, braced by a heroic sense that individuals can still make a difference.
It's not just, as you will read elsewhere, an uplifting story about two doctors. There is much more, and that more is a tragic vision of how people and society conspire in a dance of self-defeat, and where a caring person might try to change this.",1067472000,11,2126,5.16231884057971
594799,5,6303202020,"This is the most beautiful movie; its more like a long dance.  I was scanning the DVD slowly during a few scenes and was mesmerized by the movements. I think it took me about 5 hours to watch it the first time (yesteday).  Toshiro Mifune is the finest & most versatile actor ever, and when he works with the best director ever its always magic.  I've seen many of Mifune's films with and without Kurasawa.  I just needed to tell someone who could appreciate why!  And I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the scene when Chobo was ill and the women were looking down the well.  When Otoya's teardrop fell... well, it was brilliant.",1065398400,4,635,4.431034482758621
594800,5,6303202020,"This is simply the best film I've ever seen in my entire life. I've studied the films of Kurosawa Akira thoroughly and my opinion remains deeply rooted.
In a previous review of Akahige, one person mentioned the scene in which the the maids and Otoyo are screaming Chobo's name down the well. This person said this was the best scene. I have to disagree because it makes the viewer think too much about the camera, sucking the emotion out of the scene and replacing it with curiosity as to how the scene was filmed. This is a problem that occurs over and over and over again in the Wachowski brother's Matrix films. The viewer thinks about how it was really accomplished, not about any sort of sentimental value.
Other than that scene, which, actually, I believe is the worst scene, the movie is so great that it can hardly even be described in words alone. In fact, it can't because words and cinema are two different things. Watch this movie.
Just to give a little historical background, this is the final collaboration (made in 1965) between Kurosawa Akira (said to be the greatest director ever) and Mifune Toshiro (said to be the greatest actor ever). I'd also suggest watching the rest of Kurosawa Akira's films first, especially Drunken Angel, which happens to be the first time Kurosawa Akira and Mifune Toshiro worked together.
Kurosawa had never really been impressed by any actor/actress before he met Mifune. He claimed that Mifune could do in one movement what a normal actor would take three movements to express. He had just been discharged from the Japanese military and starred in half of Kurosawa Akira's films, which is quite a lot. After all, Kurosawa directed approximately thirty films in his lifetime, including such flicks as Sugata Sanshiro, Drunken Angel, The Seven Samurai, and Kagemusha.
So, all in all, this is the best film ever. One flaw is its length though, as other reviewers have mentioned. It's difficult to watch a three hour film over and over again due to its sheer size. I'm still collecting Kurosawa Akira's films, but no collection would be complete without Akahige.",1053734400,10,2107,4.823204419889502
594880,5,6303202020,"I dare you people out there. Kurosawa's most inspiring work is one breathtaking 3 hour ride into the hearts and minds of clinical doctors that has still not been matched by any ER episode. Every frame in this piece looks and feels beautiful, and thank you to Criterion for doing so. I haven't seen a Kurosawa film that has been remastered to this degree. It will be a hard one to follow-up on quality. I actually would recommmend this film to people who loved Amelie. Why? Both are incredibly inspiring movies, but Red Beard is on the other side of the spectrum. It deals with death, despair, incurable illness within the heart, but by the end of the film, you are more inspired by the will to live, to make something of yourself that you never felt before. That is what Kurosawa wanted to make, and he truly went for it on his last black and white film. The irony of what happens 5 years later. He was only human as we were. We love and miss you Kurosawa-Kantoku.
Best shot/sequence:
Here's where Kurosawa does his best. The scene where Chobo is dying and the maids are yelling down the well, the camera tilts down from the faces of the maids into the reflection of water at the bottom of the well, but gives the illusion that the camera has shifted to the bottom of the well looking up at the maids. With a single teardrop from Otoyo hitting the face of the water, then we realize that the camera is actually hidden above them. Genuine masterwork.",1052006400,29,1449,4.430711610486892
594881,5,6303202020,"In my opinion, this is one of Akira Kurosawa's best films, which means it is automatically a classic of world cinema.
As way of introduction, I would personally say of myself that I am bit of a cynic- I certainly do not expect a movie to 'change my life'. Movies are meant as entertainment, and one shouldn't look for more than that in a flick.
In the case of this film, however, I have seen something on the screen which has changed my perspective on things. I was deeply touched by the message of compassion in this film; not compassion as merely ones duty, or the contemptuous compassion of pity, but compassion as way of life. Compassion as a way of confirming the value of life. This is a powerful message- and a message that lingers long after the film is finished.
It is inevitable that any story that attempts to convey a moral  or an idea be a bit 'preachy' - the story will always find itself somewhat in service of the parable.
But, as noted above, this is a Kurosawa film. We are in the hands of a master storyteller here, and it shows in every frame, every scene and in every performance, especially that of Toshiro Mifune. Kurosawa once again uses Mifune as the glue to hold a film together, and he once again delivers. Every performance in here is a gem, many of them given by actors Kurosawa has favored in other films. But these are all but planets to Mifune's sun.
By any measure this is a great film. As with Seven Samurai, the length of the film is never felt to be excessive, as each moment of the movie is used to tell a compelling story. I feel fortunate that this film has finally been made available on DVD, where I will have the opportunity to enjoy it in years to come.
Highly recommended.",1041552000,17,1716,4.3625

594884,5,6303202020,"In Japan ""Akahige"" has come to mean selfless devotion to mankind, something you see very rarely in the medical profession today. This movie, so many people have noted over the years, should be mandatory viewing for every young student aspiring to become a doctor.
Yet this is also a movie about selfishness and common petiness. Red Beard's humanity contrasts vividly against a backdrop of poverty and injustice. Yuzo Kayama shines as the vein young doctor who is transformed to a selfless care giver of the poor as he interns under Red Beard played by Toshiro Mifune.
Many of the subplots have become cliche over the years and the movie may lag at times, but over all, this is a great masterpiece.",1038614400,7,697,4.768595041322314
594885,5,6303202020,"""Red Beard"" is a difficult film.  Kurosawa had always sought to blend entertainment with social impact.  Many of his films, such as ""Yojimbo"" and ""The Seven Samurai"" are so much fun to watch that the viewer rarely notes the message being told.  With ""Red Beard,""  the balance of message and entertainment shifts to a more heavy-handed social commentary.  There is no mistaking what Kurosawa is saying.
However, ""Red Beard"" is a great film.  Kurosawa's message is important, and worth hearing.  The film's story flows like honey down an empty riverbed, and at about the same pace.  Patience, the film tells us.  Lessons are never learned without effort.  Suffer for a while, and then you will understand.  At over 3 hours in length, patience is necessary.  There is little action to distract from the lesson.
Being the last collaboration of  Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune,  ""Red Beard"" is a masterpiece of acting and direction.  Mifune commands attention.  His character Red Beard is a powerful physician, ruling both peasant and lord.  The black and white film is powerful, making full use of the director's skill.
Those who only know Kurosawa's Samurai films will have a difficult time with ""Red Beard,"" I think.  However, patience.  The lesson is there.  Relax.  Enjoy. Learn.",1032739200,6,1276,5.038461538461538
594886,4,6303202020,"RED BEARD is a decent enough film, but far too long for the storyline Kurosawa provides. The movie reminds me of some of the better Chinese communist flims of the 1960s, which may have been influenced by RED BEARD, for all I know. But there are distinct similarities, not least of which is the promotion of the idea in this movie that the upper classes are basically morally inferior (perhaps), and that the downtrodden underclasses are morally superior to those who exploit them.
Toshiro Mifune, of course, dominates the film in his role as the selfless physician who gives free medical care to the poor peasants and prostitutes who come to him for aid. At the same time, he charges handsomely for the medical advice he doles out to the rich landowners, using those profits to provide for those less fortunate. It's an uplifting film with a strong socialist agenda, but far too cloying for my tastes.
Still and all...it's Akira Kurosawa, and he's better than almost everyone, even when he misses the mark.",1032652800,8,1006,4.787356321839081

This film wonderfully displays the silent grace and dignity Mifune plays so well. To see just how good he actually is, watch this, then watch Seven Samurai. His range is incredible. Every one of his characters is so different, all the way down to their walk. But, back to Red Beard. Like all Kurosawa films, there are some very memorable shots stylistically, and the acting is top-notch. There are many stories within the main plot, and they are all tied together very well. It isn't like a vignette piece. Each of the characters is related in one way or another. This is definitely an emotional tale, and made me feel for the characters and cheer for the compassion one human being can show to another. There isn't much humor here, like some of his other films, but it really isn't called for. If you come across the DVD from Mei-ah, do not buy it.
