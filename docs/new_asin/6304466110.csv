883074,5,6304466110,"Long on several ""lost film"" lists, ""Attack"" is at last available on video. There are several reasons to see this film. It is a  forerunner of so many grim, realistic movies that treat the subject with  intelligence (""Men In War"", ""Pork Chop Hill"",  ""Platoon"", ""The Thin Red Line""). It is brilliantly  directed (many scenes are almost unbearable in their naked dramatic truth).  And it contains several performances that demand attention.
The  conviction of Eddie Albert's playing of the cowardly Lieutenant may come as  a surprise to those unaware of his talents. Lee Marvin also delivers a  solid characterization, as do most of the other supporting players. But the  main feature of this film is the astonishing portrayal of Lt. Costa by Jack  Palance. The kind of immersion in a role that Palance exhibits here is  rare. It is the kind of performance that seems more like ""being""  than acting. A number of close-ups of Palance's face deliver a frisson of  emotional intensity and truth that are rare and wonderful in the cinema of  any period. In fact, Palance helps to demonstrate, in this picture, why  ""war films"" should exist as a genre. The condition of war, of  combat in particular, serves to foreground, polarize and intensify emotions  and moral convictions. It can call into question the very nature of  humanity. Just what is the price of a human life? What do we as humans mean  to one another? When do concepts like 'bravery' and 'cowardice' cease to  have meaning?
""Attack"" is a small film, great in its impact.",965606400,52,1528,4.848837209302325
883075,5,6304466110,"I had always heard that this was the first WWII movie with which the US Armed Forces refused to cooperate. This movie doesn't make the job of soldiering look to be glamorous (which other films have done), but it goes  one step further and does not make soldiers out to be heroic figures. The  cast in this film is one of the most eclectic you could imagine assembling,  and the move paid off in superb performances by all involved. Jack Palance  was great as a willful killing machine, and Eddie Albert plays the psycho  to perfection.",942624000,9,535,4.53125

883213,4,6304466110,"Hollywood made mostly War propaganda films in this era. This is not a war propaganda film. The storyline is one of a corrupt and cowardly Captain who commands Fox company and the colonel who protects him for back home political reasons.

 Eddie Albert is nearly perfect as the Cowardly captain and James Coburn is really good as the colonel. I thought Jack Palance was a little over-the-top as a platoon leader in Eddie Albert's company but his performance was really solid.

For fans of combat action there's some of that and there's a lot of talking that goes on that makes the movie drag a little bit at times. But overall it was a solid entertaining movie and that's what movies are about.",1472947200,,693,4.617886178861789

There are many nice touches; like the orderly's shined boots, the home-made rocket launcher grip, and the expression of Mr. Palance's character in death.  My only experience is as an officer in a peacetime Army, but I find the politics and self-serving attitudes of two of the characters here completely believable.  When the nation has to draw upon the total population to man a total war, such people would inevitably be called to serve.

884126,5,6304466110,"ITS SAID FRAGGING BEGAN DURING THE VIET NAM WAR BUT
Of Robert Aldrichs film ATTACK!, there have been complaints that Jack Palance, as the beleaguered World War II combat lieutenant of a crack unit, chews up the scenery, distracting to the films viewer.
I couldn't disagree more.
In fact, Palances performance, a smoldering volcano suppressed by supreme self-control because the surrounding situation make it necessary for a leader, stays on target from the beginning to the end, never once going off to some loose extreme.  To lose this self-control in front of his men, especially in a combat situation is venomous in effect, demoralizing, and gives an added weapon to the enemy.  He contains his inner pain and agony when his men are killed, the smart of this made worse because the detail the unit is on does not have to result in disaster.  Palance, underplaying this, is always on target.
Eddie Albert, in a brilliant, multifaceted, yet poignant portrayal, is the timorous captain whom Palance must always defer to.  He is a cowardly mediocre man frozen inside an ice block of moral weakness, indecisiveness, self-loathing which he projects onto his subordinates, belittling their mortal importance.  He rationalizes his failure to do his duty, denies his surrounding reality and clings to his bottle.  Because he knows himself, he must play the villain to sublimate his resultant spiritual emptiness.
Think of having this kind of boss; then multiply the reality of that by a thousand and imagine this in a combat situation in which, because of his flakiness, lives are lost.  It is said that fragging began during the Viet Nam War.  Why then did the crack Wehrmacht generals try to assassinate their fuhrer?  Their failure to do so, though, may have been a blessing in disguise for the Allies and may have saved additional lives.  The incompetent, if clever, moron, disconnected from reality as the Third Reich around him was on its downslide, continued to be in charge.  And the generals, like Palances character, had to follow the strict military code.
Eddie Alberts Captain, though, is not the real villain of this film.  The Colonel played by Lee Marvin, represents the greedy, self-aggrandizing politics behind every war.  With snide truthfulness, he plays off the icy slick snake in the grass hidden behind a mask of military propriety and bogus concern for the men under him.  He is almost the opposite of his character in THE DIRTY DOZEN.  This colonel nearly always survives disasters unscratches.  We know what Smithers character decides to do at the films end will achieve nothing.
Mention should be made of William Smithers who plays the moral center of the film and his handling of the stark, crackling, laconic, war-appropriate James Poe dialogue, and Robert Straus who reprises his STALAG 17 character which still fits in this film.
Buddy Epsen and Richard Jaeckel represent the quality of Palances crack unit being midled and wasted needlessly.
This film was too talky; did not have enough action for a war movie, its been said.  Again, I disagree.  Tell me Palances final scenes were not war at its ugliest.  We don't need fiery explosions, blood and bodies flying through the air to be an authentic war film.  We only need Palances jaws clenching as he watches yet another debacle through his binoculars.  Palance descending that flight of stairs almost made we want to rush into the film and help him.
Based on the play FRAGILE FOX by Norman Brooks, this film, thanks to Palance and the ensemble, Roberts artful production and direction, the spot on cinematography, is a classic, worthy of repeated viewings and further needed contemporary political dialogue.",1462233600,,3684,5.016420361247947

884360,5,6304466110,"By the mid 1950s, many of the men who had fought on the front lines in World War II had reached an age where they could look back on their service in the war and honestly discuss some of the very un-heroic things they had experienced.  This new maturity manifested first in literature like Herman Wouks THE CAINE MUTINY and James Joness FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, both made into excellent movies.  ATTACK, which came out in 1956, is based on a stage play and it dealt with the enormously corrupting effect the brutality of war has on the men who fight it; the movie turned out to be tough stuff for its time and more than holds up after all these decades.

The main reason ATTACK still resonates is because it was directed by the great Robert Aldrich, a master film maker who knew how to make great entertainments while never pulling his punches when it came to the brutal aspects of his stories and was equally at home directing war movies like ATTACK, melodramas like THE BIG KNIFE, westerns like VERA CRUZ and ULZANAS RAID, or psychological horror films such as WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE and HUSHHUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE.  The man knew what he wanted and how to get it all up there on the movie screen.

ATTACK is not an epic on the same level as BATTLEGROUND or the much later SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; its scope is small, mainly because Aldrichs production company could not procure cooperation from the Pentagon because they had understandable problems with the script.  But this ground level view of the war in Europe perfectly suits the story of an infantry unit saddled with a cowardly commander whose incompetence is as much a threat to the men he leads as the German Whermacht.  When orders compel the badly fatigued soldiers to advance into an enemy held town, the ensuing carnage causes long held back tensions to explode as one Lieutenant turns upon his Captain with murderous fury.  It all ends in a gripping final scene, set in a basement as the GIs hide from the advancing Germans, where men pushed to their limits, do what they have to do.

ATTACK is filled with some to the finest tough guys and character stars of its time, starting with Jack Palance as Lt. Costa, a brave soldier on the battlefield who is tired of suffering the ineptitude of his immediate superior and Lee Marvin as Colonel Clyde Bartlett, an officer with his eyes already fixed on a post war political career.  In between them is Eddie Alberts Captain Cooney, the useless son of an important Kentucky politician, a man so utterly unfit for the responsibility placed upon him that he curls up on his bed when the Germans attack.  This is one of Palances finest performances, worthy of an Oscar nomination; it is notable in that Palance, one of the great scenery chewers, really underplays it here until his final, agonized confrontation with Albert in the cellar.  Eddie Albert had a long, very versatile career, often playing nice guys and sidekicks to bigger stars, but he had a knack for portraying unsympathetic characters as well, and his Erskine Cooney was one of his best examples of the latter-a man who won't even try to over come his weaknesses, who would rather surrender to the Germans than face the risk of combat.  Palance, Albert and Marvin were decorated veterans, Albert winning a Bronze Star for bravery at Tarawa.  Its obvious their wartime experiences infuse their work here.

The supporting cast include a lot of familiar faces such as Buddy Ebsen as a capable Sergeant; gravelly voiced Robert Strauss playing a variation of the character he played in STALAG 17; Richard Jaeckel playing essentially the same soldier he played in at least a half dozen other war films.  Strother Martin turns up briefly and German born Peter Van Eyck, playing an SS officer, was a naturalized American citizen who served in the US Army during the war.  William Smithers plays Palances fellow Lieutenant, who ultimately faces a difficult choice in the end between doing what is expedient or doing what is right.

The B&W cinematography by Joseph Biroc, who worked often with Aldrich, is superb; there is also some terrific dialog that hits with effect of a bullet:  Captain, down around where I come from, we dearly love our whiskey.  But we don't drink with another man unless we respect him.

A few years later Ebsen and Albert would be starring in The Beverly Hilbillies and Green Acres, two of CBSs top rated rural comedies, material about as far from ATTACK as they could get.  Marvin would go on to work with Aldrich several times, most notably in THE DIRTY DOZEN; interestingly his Colonel Bartlett, swaggering in his spotless uniform, gives us the only hint what his PATTON might have looked like-he was the producers first choice for the role, but Marvin passed on the part.  Smithers would go on to do a lot of work on TV, most memorably a decade later on a classic episode of Star Trek where he played a Star Fleet officer who, unlike his officer in ATTACK, does not do his duty.  Albert and Aldrich would reunite when he played the Warden in THE LONGEST YARD.

Many of the reviewers for ATTACK mention how they first saw this movie as a kid on TV and how it made a strong impression on them.  It has some of the strongest scenes in any war movie of its time, especially the part where a German tank roles over a screaming Palances arm and pins him there.  I can attest that this stuff, not BAMBI, was what we wanted to watch when we were young boys.  It has been called a forgotten film, but not by anybody who has seen it.",1449619200,,5518,4.620266120777892

Costa is still vivid in my mind, as is Eddie Albert's performance as the cowardly Capt. Cooney.

Jack Palance is a platoon leader who is repeatedly betrayed by his cowardly company commander (Edward Albert).  Peter Strauss is the company executive officer who consistently attempts to work with the captain and give him the benefit of the doubt, until that approach is no longer possible. Buddy Ebsen of the Beverly Hillbillies has a dramatic role here as Palance's platoon sergeant, and he does an absolutely remarkable job.

This is a story about combat in 1944 Europe that shows personality conflicts among officers, and how special relationships can count more than job performance. [Just like in some corporations.] There is a new advance that may not go as well as planned. What if Captain Cooney fails to support Lieutenant Costa's platoon? Are the men walking into a trap? No air reconnaissance? Then a German tank shows up to force the men to retreat. The Colonel arrives to order Captain Cooney to hold their position. Does Lieutenant Woodruff speak too freely? Should the Captain be relieved due to his mental condition? Lieutenant Costa returns just before another tank attacks. A bazooka disables it, the crew is neutralized. Then another tank appears. The Germans move into town now.

There is a very dramatic moment when Captain Cooney goes to surrender and meets Lieutenant Costa for a confrontation. ""The krauts got Cooney."" Another soldier tells of reinforcements. Lieutenant Woodruff replaced Captain Cooney. There is a final dramatic conversation, then a dramatic but ambiguous ending to this very cynical story. I wonder what was the purpose of this film? Did the audiences of the mid-1950s find it credible?

Movies of the 1950s (like ""Battle Cry"") presented a different view of WW II movies (like ""A Walk in the Sun"" or ""The Sands of Iwo Jima""). Was this supposed to represent the Battle of the Bulge, which took place in December 1944? The movie ""Battleground"" did a better job.

Even at the end of the movie when he is ready to surrender to the Germans and betray his comrades position, this worm of a character gives the movie its churn. The universal theme here is the leader who doesn't have your back, who will let you get in harms way, or sell you out because of an innate fear that seems to bely the human condition.

884469,5,6304466110,"I am not a fan of war films. However, a friend brought this DVD to my attention, and I was riveted by the performances and the script.

The setting is the Battle of the Bulge. Eddie Albert brilliantly portrays a cowardly captain. Lee Marvin is a colonel who totally ignores the mistakes made by Albert, thereby ignoring the safety of the platoon for which he is ultimately responsible. The platoon, however, is lead by Jack Palance, who takes full responsibility for his men. Palance has been wounded in the battle, and his to lead the men back despite his injury. The worst part is, he has to get them to safety while they have been left completely without protection!

The confrontation between Jack Palance and Eddie Albert is magnificent, exposing the behaviors of some officers during World War II. It's important to remember that this film was created during the Eisenhower era, and not surprisingly, there was no government aid in the making of this film provided. If the film had been a more flag-waving presentation showing bravery on all levels, certainly there would have been a seal of approval and cooperation from the government.

Jack Palance and Eddie Albert played, at different types of psychic disturbance, two officers who struggle on the battlefield -- the one an efficacious, trustworthy, but disillusioned hero-typed, the other a cowardly sadist...

Lee Marvin was the cynical high-ranking officer who treats war as a political farce, mindless of the pain and distress of the ordinary soldiers...

Despite an inevitable over-fondness for the dramatic values of combat and the ferocious of men at arms, this was a convincing, truthful try to demythologize war -- which, had it been set up in a lower key with fewer psychiatric reverberations, would have come nearer to being what Aldrich was struggling to achieve, 'a sincere plea for peace'.",1166313600,6,1005,5.3081761006289305
884485,4,6304466110,"This sounds like one of those routine war movies -- brave unit leader having problems with a cowardly superior just as the enemy launches a major offensive. But what sets ""Attack!"" apart from the others is its great cast and director Robert Aldrich's masterful handling of a story derived from a stage play.

Jack Palance is the tough lieutenant who has been let down once too often by his drunken and cowardly captain (Eddie Albert) just ahead of an attack by the Germans. Taking it up with their commanding officer (Lee Marvin) is no use as he is covering Albert's back because he is the son of an influential judge back home.

Matters come to a head when Albert sends Palance's unit head-first into a town crawling with Germans and then refuses to send in more troops to help them. You just know that a major confrontation is coming up, and its one heck of a ride getting there, thanks largely to the fine acting by Palance, Marvin, Albert and the bit players like Robert Strauss, Richard Jaeckel and Buddy Ebsen.

The US Army reportedly extended no cooperation to Aldrich after reading the hard-hitting script, and this movie was shot on the backlot with a shoe-string budget. Aldrich had only two tanks for his big action scenes, but none of these constraints show up on the screen. The action scenes help open up the movie and broaden its stage play origins.

The film isn't without the usual war movie problems, like the stereotypical evil Nazis and SS troops, but the such problems are few and far between.

Palance is in terrific form, carrying the picture on his broad shoulders. If ever proof was needed that the guy could act, this movie delivers it in spades. His character is no hero -- just a guy doing his job the best he can.

Lee Marvin turns in a strong performance too, and Eddie Albert is perfect as the cowardly captain, especially considering the fact that he was a real life war hero. But the real star is director Aldrich, who keeps things moving along at a nice clip.

The DVD serves up ""Attack!"" in all its black and white splendour...the print is good with little evidence of wear and tear. The soundtrack is a nice solid mono. A great thinking person's war movie.",1157673600,4,2192,4.59079283887468

Palance is the scariest bastard in the European theatre of war, and seems to have nine lives. He only leaves this Earth by having his soul ripped from it: his death-face is one of the most terrifying in all cinema. This is Palance as an almost unstoppable force of nature, but who's still recognisably human because he so obviously cares about his men. But he also hates in equal measure. The class difference between himself, Eddie Albert and Lee Marvin makes for an obvious Marxist reading, summed-up in the film's final sequence. But this is also a penetrating study in machismo. As such, one can see this as the third film in Aldrich's trilogy (along with Kiss Me Deadly and The Big Knife) of studies of powerful but flawed men who seek meaning within an amoral universe. Indeed, Aldrich might be the most trenchant analyst of the late fifties American male hero.

'Attack' was not popular because it showed an ugly side of war that no American wanted to acknowldege:  the war where your most hated enemy is your own incompetent commanding officer.

Palance plays a tough, brave, sensitive and virile lieutenant; a dedicated American GI who's seen too many good soldiers die needlessly.

Albert, his CO, is a cowardly, weak, and weasely drunkard, the  son-of-an-important-guy-back-home.  His portrayal was so effective I loathed Albert for decades afterward.

Palance plays his part better than most actors could, with tension and conflict oozing from his pores.  Some reviewers mistake Palance's performance of a seething, panting, frustrated man  as  over-acting.  I saw Palance as effectively trying to keep all his conflicted emotions bottled up while being torn apart between his duty as an American officer and his human duty to protect his men from his incompetent CO.

This is a film exposing those leaders who are all textbook and no experience, sending many to their deaths with a lack of support and moral backbone. It is almost prophetic in what most veterans of future wars would find all too common.

In the end, when war is upon the front line, the disguise of an invisible wall between men and rank disappear. Men must ultimately do what is right. Men must protect others not hide behind their cowardly authority.

Right is might versus might makes right is a constant theme in this film. From the righteous anger of Jack Palance to the neutral-turned-virtuous young lieutentant. The former, outraged by the cowardice and failures of Eddie Albert and the latter stopping his friend from committing the atrocity of murder, only to do the same in self-defence and forego Marvin's (the Colonel) temptations of promotion and vanity.

884490,4,6304466110,"In the arena of public awareness, Attack!'s all-star cast does not seem to have been enough to overcome its B-movie title, one which is neither appropriate nor sufficiently ironic. The film's original name was more in line with the Norman Brooks play on which it is based, ""Fragile Fox."" Indeed, key scenes are staged and designed like a ""filmed play,"" but that only heightens the drama here. Riveting from the get-go, the 107-minute cut seems to fly by in an hour.
To find the real drama in Robert Aldrich's film, viewers should discard the extreme characterizations of the brave Lt. Joe Costa (Jack Palance) and the cowardly Capt. Cooney (Eddie Albert) like the high and low data that is thrown out before analysis. (Many of the best scenes are absent Palance, whose over-the-top performance could certainly bug some viewers.) The real questions are raised by the seemingly level-headed men in the middle who recognize the potentially volatile situation for what it is and choose to deal with it in ways befitting their divergent perspectives. Bartlett (Lee Marvin) is an ambitious and crafty colonel who tolerates Cooney's incompetence because of the latter's political connections back home. He is at odds with Lt. Henry Woodruff (William Smithers), one of the men who could potentially end up as fodder for Cooney's foolery.
Anyone who has ever been skipped over for promotion or lost the lead in a grade school play owing to a lack of either political connections or a willingness to screw over their comrades will recognize all the characters in ""Attack!"" Illustrating that human frailties are easily mapped onto a combat situation (and suggesting there's no reason they wouldn't be), this is the scariest of war films. Despite its meditation on moral relativism, ""Attack""--universally hailed as an ""anti-war film""--never once argues that this particular conflict is not worth the fighting. As the glue that holds the ensemble piece together, Smithers' Woodruff argues, ""If we can get rid of Cooney, all we have to do is fight the war.""",1108339200,12,2043,5.0652818991097925

Yes, the tension is seething between the two antagonists, but the sets are cheap, the dialogue laughable, and the acting hilarious.

Everything about this movie is Hollywood garbage.  Defiant, cruel Germans.  Tough, willing Americans.  The tactics are laughable, and the lingo is inaccurate.
Yes there is some gore and this is not a rally-round-the-flag, patriotic entertainer, but this is a script that should have stayed on a stage.  Perhaps the only saving grace is that while they used U.S. tanks to portray the Germans, they at least had the decency to visually modify them to look somewhat like German vehicles.

The black and white photography isn't of the fuzzy, ""atmospheric"", Film Noir variety- it is the stark, crisp b&w of the combat cameraman. Nor are the details distracting- the equipment and procedures are absolutely accurate for the WWII European theater (for a change those are actual Shermans in the background.) You can cut the tension with a knife, both in the combat scenes and the HQ. Plus, these guys are not all scrubbed and clean shaven- they look like they are bone tired and crawling with tiny livestock.
It is the acting that sticks in your mind. This was probably the best thing Jack Palance ever did as the experienced Lt. that has to sit by as he watches two platoons (including his own) destroyed by the cowardice and incompetence of the company commander. When Palance tells him that he will shove a grenade down his throat and pull the pin if he doesn't support his assault- you believe every word. Eddie Arnold is totally believable as that incompetent Captain (a rich National Guard officer with a powerful father, political connections, a southern accent, and a drinking problem.) Sometimes art does imitate life. Lee Marvin has a most believable role as the Col. who ""looks after"" Arnold because he wants his father's political help after the war. Marvin knows that Arnold is gutless and incompetent but he doesn't want him on his own efficient staff, nor does he dare kick him upstairs were his superiors can get a good look at him. So Arnold stays in command of a combat unit.... After all, the chances are 100 to 1 that the unit will ever see real combat again- but then the Germans launch a counter offensive. Oh yeah, Buddy Ebsen does a surprisingly good job as the veteran sharpshooter from the backwoods, but then I don't think anyone turned in a bad performance in this film.
This is the most believable war film in terms of combat and politics that I believe has ever been made.",1081036800,6,1963,4.709302325581396
884493,5,6304466110,"Many of the friends with whom I share ""Top Ten"" lists do not include Attack! among their favorite war films. In fact, few of them have seen it and that's a shame. Perhaps its title (like Zulu's) deters them. Perhaps the cast lacks appeal. Who knows? Perhaps even they don't. In any event, I think this is a brilliant screen adaptation of a play written by Norman Brooks (The Fragile Fox) which focuses on a cowardly officer, Captain Erskine Cooney (Eddie Albert). What is even worse than entrusting him with his command is allowing him to continue with it despite evidence of incompetence. For that, Colonel Bartlett (Lee Marvin) must be blamed. (Of  course, he has his self-serving reasons which are revealed in the film.) Brilliantly directed by Robert Aldrich, Albert and the other cast members are first-rate but Jack Palance as Lieutenant Joe Costa is the gravitational center of the compelling narrative. It is almost possible to hear his teeth grinding as he endures Cooney throughout much of the film. Finally....
At first glance, the cast consists of an odd combination which includes Palance, Albert, Marvin, Buddy Ebsen (Sergeant Tolliver), Robert Strauss (Private Bernstein), Richard Jaeckel (Private Snowden), and William Smithers (Lieutenant Woodruff)...most of whom (notably Albert and Marvin) portray characters unlike most with which they are usually identified. Obviously, a major war creates odd ""trench fellows"" but, thanks to the talents brought to bear by Aldrich and his cast, this film has credibility and authenticity throughout its running time of less than two hours. Tension is inevitable in combat. Our emotional involvement is increased and enhanced by curiosity as to how much damage Cooney's inadequacies will eventually cause, and, whether or not his cowardice will be punished. In many instances, screen adaptations of plays seem talky, ""staged,"" confined, etc. Not so with Attack! It can be fully appreciated without knowing that it is based on The Fragile Fox whose clever title is probably inappropriate title for a film.
Those who share my high regard for Attack! are urged to check out Paths of Glory (1957), Breaker Morant (1980), and Gallipoli (1981).",1079395200,10,2192,5.209631728045326
884504,4,6304466110,"I just purchased this DVD at Wal-Mart for $6.99 a few days ago on a whim. However, I was very pleasantly surprised! Given that it is now almost 50 years old, and in B&W, it was a  surprisingly good and enjoyable expose on the corrupt side of war.
I recommend it for all WW II film buffs.",1074211200,,287,4.035087719298246
884505,5,6304466110,"This film is almost 50 years old, yet it still packs a wallop for viewers. I called the title ""unfortunate"", because it implies that this is an action movie--of course, it is much more. There are certainly battle scenes, and they are grim and realistic--no John Wayne heroics here. At the same time, the opening credits indicate that ""Attack"" is based on a play--so much of the film is dedicated to character development by some excellent actors.

The Nazis are the enemy, but these American GIs have another enemy within their midst--a cowardly, villainous commanding officer who has a well-deserved reputation for letting his men down. Some good soldiers lose their lives because of this officer's incompetence and indecision. In this role, Eddie Albert gives a wonderful, unforgettable performance. Later in his career, ""Green Acres"" may have given him more financial security, but it was obviously a waste of a huge talent.

As the brave GI who must report to a drunken coward, Jack Palance is rivetting in one of his best performances--his confrontation scenes with Eddie Albert really sizzle with animosity. Messrs. Palance and Albert are well supported by great character actors like Robert Strauss, Richard Jaeckel and the recently-departed Buddy Ebsen. Eddie Albert's commanding officer is played by Lee Marvin--and with Lee Marvin, ""commanding"" is the word ! Unfortunately, the Marvin character is just as corrupt, and self-serving in his own way as the man he supervises.

As I said earlier, this is a war movie that makes you think--it is not intended to merely entertain. I would not call it anti-war--there is no question that the Nazis here, mostly SS, are evil. To emphasize the point, we learn that Robert Strauss' character is Jewish, and how he would be treated if captured by the SS. Most of the American soldiers are depicted as brave, honest, dedicated men, laying their lives on the line every day. Nevertheless--as ""Attack"" shows us-- sometimes people are put in positions of authority for reasons that have nothing to do with merit--whether it is the military, in business, government or other fields of endeavour. In this case, of course, it is a problem that costs lives. It is a powerful message.

The DVD is nice--clear B & W picture--the sound is mono--the price reasonable.

Bottom line--a fine, thinking person's World War II drama, that deserves a higher profile.

A sad footnote dated 10 November 2006. Mr. Jack Palance just passed away--an Oscar-winner and one of the most formidable presences to ever grace the silver screen.",1058745600,86,2561,5.056872037914692
884506,4,6304466110,"ATTACK! is a cult classic that should be bought by all WWII movie fanatics. I bought the DVD version the day it was released, and am pleased with the image and sound quality, eventhough it is in Standard Format (not Widescreen). The Trailer, included as a Special Feature, is horrible though.
All of the Customer Reviews listed for this Movie are very good.
However, I must add that the Combat Scenes tend to be both poorly acted and directed. ATTACK! does usually portray the German Enemy as fearsome and deadly. However, the manner in which both American and German soldiers get shot is usually laughable. I think ATTACK! tops both ANZIO and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as the WWII movie which includes the WORST sniper in the German Army (the guy is even supposed to be from an SS Unit). In contrast, ENEMY AT THE GATES has the best one (Ed Harris).",1056499200,3,844,4.596026490066225
884507,5,6304466110,"Director Robert Aldrich's contribution to American cinema has seemed to diminish over the years since his untimely death. ATTACK was one of his better films. I remember seeing it many years ago and it was quite realistic and graphic for its time. The chiseled face of Jack Palance as the dutiful Lt. Costa is still vivid in my mind, as is Eddie Albert's performance as the cowardly Capt. Cooney. This is a grim and hard boiled film with an engaging plot that really questions the reason why man must die in war and who ultimately bears the responsibility for sending combatants to their deaths. This film contains outstanding performances by all including Lee Marvin, Richard Jaeckel, Buddy Ebsen, Robert Strauss, William Smithers, Strother Martin and Peter Van Eyck. Cinematographer Joseph Biroc's photography is stark bringing a feeling of hopelessness and despair to this film about men in war. A very good DVD.",1055203200,28,914,5.019736842105263
884508,5,6304466110,"This old warhorse from the 1950s is worthy of better reknown.  Some good actors are in it who would become standards later on.  The movie does not provide a flattering portrait of the US Army toward the end of the war, and perhaps this is why it has not enjoyed the popularity of other war films of this period.  Lee Marvin plays an excellent, corrupt good old time boy in charge of a crumbling US infantry battalion.  Eddie Albert is great as the cowardly company commander, while Jack Polance is almost demonic, yet compelling. The scene where Polance gets run over by the German tank is perhaps excessive, but its horror shows that this is a movie not affraid to show the true nature of war. It certainly marks a departure from most post war movies of this period. At the same time the movie is not excessively violent or bloody. The equipment lacks authencity in that US stuff is pressed into German service, but at least some attempts are made to modify its appearence. The movie almost seems like a play at times, and I wonder if aspects of it were not in this format beforehand.  The music is also very good and provides for a great atmosphere.  A good offbeat GI movie that deserves better recognition and a DVD release.",1052438400,14,1228,4.509009009009009
884509,4,6304466110,"Director Robert Aldrich (Kiss Me Deadly, Ulzana's Raid, Apache) has never been one to make the typical war movie and Attack! is no exception.  The story, set in ""Europe: 1944"", concerns Fox Company which is ""led"" by the incompetent Captain Cooney (Eddie Albert).  Lt. Costa (Jack Palance) has lost men and has been sent carelessly into deadly situations by Cooney.  Cooney is an alcoholic coward who later totally flips out.  Anyone who only knows Albert from ""Green Acres"" has to see this performance, especially his nervous breakdown scene to really see what he was capable of.  Lee Marvin plays Col. Bartlett, who doesent want to admit to Cooney's incapabilities as an Officer because he receives legal favors from Cooney's prominent Judge father in return for securing his son's position as Captain.  Costa vows to Cooney that if one more of his men die, he will come back and kill him.  I won't reveal the conclusion, but it keeps you guessing until the last shot.  A Robert Aldrich war film has a way of focusing more on the personal weaknesses and morals of the characters rather than being a historical document of the conflict.  In other words, this film is about the internal/external conflicts between the individual American soldiers.  It is not really about why we were at war with the Nazis, although it is set in the context of that conflict.
Very unique film, especially in the war film genre and I hope it makes its way to a nice representation on DVD someday.  Definitely worth seeking out in any capacity, whether its to rent or own.

884510,5,6304466110,"ATTACK is one of the great war films of all time. It very nearly never got to print since the US Armed Forces withdrew its backing when the Powers That Be learned of its anti-war thrust that sometimes we were not all the good guys. Director Robert Aldrich guttily refused to lessen his attack, not specifically on the singular incompetence of one American company commander, but on the collective incompetence of many others. Jack Palance plays Lieutenant Costa, in what is surely the finest role of his long career. He is a platoon commander who values the lives of his men enough to stick out his neck for them when he feels that his own commander, played by Eddie Albert, uses them as dispensable pawns in his own psychotic game. Costa is an intimidating presence who refuses to allow the failure of his own flesh to prevent him from saving his men. Eddie Albert is Captain Cooney, a man with severe psychological problems who is given a company to command only because of family connections. The viewer is not sure how much to sympathize with him when it becomes clear that he is unfit to command. There is a startling scene when he and another lieutenant, well played by William Smithers, are discussing how to repel the latest Nazi attack. Cooney seems mentally disjointed and becomes unglued right in front of Smithers' eyes. Cooney relives a beating that he got from his father years ago, indicating that his unfitness to command preceded the added strain of combat to an already fragile ego. Costa is enraged at Cooney's cowardice that resulted in the deaths of many of his men and determines to kill him even at the cost of his own life. The scene in which he rips off his own arm from under a tank tread is a chilling reminder of the impact that war can have on the human psyche.
 ATTACK is a movie of continuous scenes that indicate that the damage of war is at least as often mental as physical. When Lee Marvin, who plays Cooney's commander, comments on the whereabouts of Costa, he says, 'Don't worry about Costa. He has more lives than a cat.' That may be so, but in war, even cats use up their lives pretty quickly. No other movie says this as eloquently as ATTACK.",1027468800,8,2182,4.552162849872774
884511,4,6304466110,"The screenplay for this film was so gritty that the Department of Defense withdrew its production support.  Director Robert Aldrich was left to pull military equipment from studio warehouses and the back lot vehicle boneyard.  No matter, ATTACK, which was adapted from the stage play FRAGILE FOX, constitutes the guts and glory adventures of an infantry platoon during the Battle of the Bulge.

Synopsis:  An infantry company is saddled with ill suited company commander.  Cpt. Erskine Cooney (Eddie Albert) was tolerable as a company commander of a National Guard outfit in peace time, but unfit for command of a combat unit.  The movie opens with Cooney paralyzed with fear and unable to order his company to relieve a pinned squad.  Lieutenant Costa (Jack Palance) never forgave nor trusted Cooney for his fatal command indecision. The link between Cooney and Costa is company executive officer Lieutenant Harry Woodruff (William Smithers).  Woodruff is too dedicated to his duty to move against his superior officer and yet sympathizes with Costa.  Woodruff does inform Cooney's superior Lt. Col. Clyde Bartlett (Lee Marvin) about his concerns about Cooney, but Bartlett assures Woodruff that the company is moving out of the line and hints that the war is almost over.  Bartlett has other reasons for keeping the obvously unfit Cooney in command as Cooney's father, known as ""The Judge,"" is very politically connected back home.  As such, Bartlett's future is tied to that of Cooney.

Unfortunately the war does not end as the Germans launch an attack.  Though it is never specifically stated, we are left to believe that the German offensive is part of the Battle of the Bulge.  Cooney once again sends a solitary platoon to occupy a key village and finds himself frozen by fear and unable to contemplate committing the remainder of the company to rescure the ambushed platoon.  Costa, with a mere squad holding a house on the edge of the village, orders his men to withdraw under withering German fire.

As a consequence the Germans advance into the village hosting Cooney's command and a severely wounded Lieutanant Costa vows to kill Cooney.

Jack Palance stars as the units' respected platoon leader who not only battles the Germans, but also the illogical and destructive orders of his psycotic company commander.  Rounding out the cast is Buddy Ebsen as Costa's common sense platoon sergeant.

The best and the worst of human nature is portrayed in this film.  Action packed scenes are complimented by excellent human drama scenes.  ATTACK dared to show the darker side of human behavior in a film where the enemy was not necessarily the greatest threat.

The film was denied extensive military hardware.  Though a few Sherman tanks do dart past the camera in both the beginning and end of the film, the German tanks are limited to small surplus American 1935 era M2 tanks chassis.  Even with wooden prop shop sides and guns, these tanks were so short in stature that in one scene Jack Palance crouches and acts as if he is laboring up the steep side of a monsterous tank, when in realtiy he stood taller than the top of the tank.

The Germans are equipped with the usual wardrobe stock of uniforms, helmets, and rifles more appropriate for World War One.  The one exception is Peter Van Eyck's SS uniform -- itself bearing pre-war insignia.

The famous Culver City 40 Acres European set was used for most of the combat scenes in the village.  The outdoor scenes complete with powdered ""snow"" added to the edge of the one-lane road was filmed in nearby Thousand Oaks, which was a regular outdoor film location for westerns and war movies. If the opening pillbox terrain looks familiar, it also served as a pillbox location for COMBAT!'s two part episode HILLS ARE FOR HEROES filmed at Albertson's Ranch.

This film was already long overdue when it finally became available on VHS.  It is in even better shape on DVD.  This is one of those classic war films that has to be part of any serious war film collection.",1005091200,11,4024,4.882179675994109
884512,5,6304466110,"As other reviewers point out this is one heck of a neglected movie, one that achieves an intensity  rare in a film of any type. Perhaps some background would be helpful to the film's growing popularity. Produced in 1956 at the height of the Cold War, Attack! was reviled by conservatives and liberals alike (many walked out during the showing) for its unflattering portrayal of the army's hallowed field command. It took a lot of guts for Bob Aldrich to oversee production during an era of political repression, monitored by a hostile corps of film reviewers ready to pounce on anything that looked unAmerican. But Aldrich was determined not to be intimidated and to show a side of combat few Americans knew. One of only a few Hollywood movie-makers to challenge the conventions, he is reponsible for such other ground-breaking classics as The Big Knife and of course the highly innovative Kiss Me Deadly.
Because of its subject matter, Attack! was quickly consigned to audience oblivion where it largely remains, awaiting rediscovery as the brutally honest and superb film that it is. Even knowledgeable movie-goers believe that Kubrick's 1957, Paths of Glory, is the first 50's anti-war film. Anyone having seen Attack! knows this is definitely not so. In fact, the latter surpasses Kubrick's celebrated film in at least two categories - Its willingness to take on the WWII American establishment instead of the more remote WWI French military, and Jack Palance's absolutely unforgettable performance as Lt. Costa, perhaps the finest and most affecting to be found in any war movie. The reassuring ending may strike some as a cop-out and probably does represent the outermost limits of the time. Nevertheless, in a telling absence, we are never shown how army brass responds to the Lieutenant's urgency, suggesting that the corruption may even extend to higher-ups - Aldrich may have compromised but he wasn't dishonest!
The internet may be the perfect medium for rescuing Hollywood's many overlooked gems. Movies that were made with care, intelligence, and most of all - conviction, but which for whatever reason, passed into film oblivion. Attack! is definitely one of these. But just as importantly, the movie serves as an enduring tribute to the guiding hand and perseverence of its gutsy and talented director, Robert Aldrich. Don't miss it.",1003968000,26,2348,5.114583333333333
884513,5,6304466110,"I saw this movie because I am a fan of Jack Palance and have wanted to see Robert Aldrich's ""Attack"" for many years.  ""Attack"" is on my personal list as one of the Ten Greatest Movies.  This film is badly underrated.  I have never seen a better World War II film.  I am disappointed that this film is not better known by the moviegoing public.
In wartorn Europe, incompetent Army Captain Eddie Albert endangers his troops and Army Lieutenant Jack Palance stands up to him.
Adding to the credibility of ""Attack"" is a cast that actually fought in World War II.  Unlike many present day war films that feature performers who lack even peacetime military experience, ""Attack"" features actors with genuine combat experience: Jack Palance, Eddie Albert, and Lee Marvin.  The film realistically captures the desperation and tension of military combat.  Viewers empathize with the trauma and pain felt by the characters.
The film also features great performances from its leading actors.  Jack Palance is one of Hollywood's most underrated performers.  After more than forty years in the entertainment business, Palance would finally win an Oscar for ""City Slickers""(1991) but ""Attack"" is the movie for which Palance should have received this honor; Palance wasn't even nominated for this picture.  Perennial villain Palance proved that he could play a good guy(Or certainly a great antihero) in an unforgettable movie.  Eddie Albert, who would become best known for TV's ""Green Acres"" and ""Switch,"" proves that he could give a serious dramatic performance in a movie.  Albert's cowardly and neurotic Captain Cooney is one of the screen's great villains.  Buddy Ebsen(Another future TV star) also gives a fine supporting turn.
