8227568,5,B000XA8568,I loved it and I would purchase from this person again. I bought it for 2 reasons. I wanted it for myself and my wife had never seen it. She loved it and we ended up going to see Transformers rise of the fallen. Thanks.,1247184000,,219,3.888888888888889
8227569,5,B000XA8568,Transformers was my son's favorite program when he was a little boy and now it's his son's favorite movie.  I got it so we could watch it when they come to visit.  My grandson was so excited!!!  He thinks his grandmother is too old to know what the Transformers are. lol  I was pleased that the movie did not change the original characters and followed the story line.  My favorite is Bumblebee and my son's is Optimus Prime.  My grandson must have a dark side...his favorite is Star Scream.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive the movie in a very short time and in excellent condition.  We've watched it many times and I'm sure we'll be watching it many more times in the future.  Thank you for your promptness in getting this out to me.  It was really great doing business with you.,1239235200,,787,4.440559440559441
8227570,4,B000XA8568,"First let me say that this is by far the best movie ever created...with that said, about the DVD: There are no special features on this DVD set, unless you consider multiple languages/subtitles and scene selections as special features.  The menu has 3 options, set up, scenes, and movie.  The second disc with the prequel 'Transformers Beginnings' is cool to watch once, just to get some background.  It's semi-animated, comic looking still-pictures with some moving parts, almost like glorified story boards.  And that's it, nothing else on the second DVD, not even a menu!!  I would recommend getting the edition with special features and borrowing the prequel from someone. But if you don't care about special features, then this is the set for you.",1192752000,14,752,5.032258064516129
