8361903,5,B002BTON24,The docudrama was very interesting and very well acted. It showed very little of the wit and humour of the public persona but focussed on the dark side of Williams' personality. That tended to make it gloomy watching.,1409097600,,217,4.7368421052631575
8361904,4,B002BTON24,Michael Sheen does a GREAT job as this strangely quirk man.  If you don't know who Kenneth Williams is  then this might you leave you a little bewildered  wondering why he was popular at all  he was so STRANGE.  However if you are familiar with Mr Williams work  then this is a fascinating insight into his personality.  I knew all about his movie career as such  but was not aware of his self loathing and his friendship with Joe Orton.  All in all rewarding experience,1402099200,,470,4.435294117647059
