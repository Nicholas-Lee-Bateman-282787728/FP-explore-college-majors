4395519,1,B004K5RN2O,"I ordered ""Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch"" and ""Speed Buggy"" from Amazon.com. The two items came together in a box from Amazon. The dvd boxes were sealed with plastic so I thought everything would be just fine. Well, I was WRONG. Both sets have CIRCULAR SCRATCHES on them. Them have these SCRATCHES due to POOR and CHEAP design. To save MONEY the manufacturer put a SWINGING DUAL DVD retainer in both boxes. Wheelie is a three disc set and Speed is a FOUR disc set. The sets are the same size as a normal SINGLE disc box. The SWINGING DUAL DVD RETAINER allowed the discs to SPIN in place. Since the discs are mounted back to back in an offset position the design left a perforated area in the plastic where the retainer ring sits. So the delicate back side of the disc was pushed into the hard plastic perforation causing circular scratches. So both sets have scratches. This set also will not play on my cheap Samsung DVD recorder/vhs player. So I need to either watch these CARTOONS on my computer or I need to buy another dvd player. The design of the discs is not the standard dvd format. I ran into this format before with the tv movie about Ted Bundy called ""The Deliberate Stranger"". I had to watch that dvd set on the computer. At least that movie did not arrive with scratches.

4395520,4,B004K5RN2O,"As a child of the seventies, I have great memories of this and many other Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoons.  Viewing them now at age 43, I still enjoy them, although many years of exposure to so much animation has perhaps made me a bit more jaded.

As you may know, HB were pioneers of the art of ""limited animation,"" which came about in the late 50's and early 60's.  A simple description of limited animation is that the characters don't move nearly as much as, say, those of the Looney Tunes of the Golden Age from the late 1930's thru the 1950's.  It's a time-saving and money-saving technique that worked well for animated shows made for the demanding schedules of weekly television.

Anyway, there were still many colorful and funny cartoons made using this technique.  And thankfully, Speed Buggy is one of them.  Like many other HB cartoons of the seventies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goober-And-The-Ghost-Chasers/dp/B00480OCWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goober And The Ghost Chasers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Josie-and-the-Pussycats-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000RPD0DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Josie and the Pussycats - The Complete Series</a>, etc.), Speed Buggy follows the comic adventures of a group of young people as they get involved in various mysteries or tangle with madcap villains.  It's all done with a sense of innocent fun, with the Mel Blanc-voiced lovable title character front and center.

Like other recent cartoon releases from Warner Bros., Speed Buggy is ""made on demand"" using DVD-R discs.  This is my second such purchase (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Herculoids-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00553KAK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Herculoids: The Complete Series</a>), and I'm happy to report that the series looks and sounds great.  There are, however, no extra features of any kind.  No alternate-language tracks or subtitles, just a menu allowing you to select episodes or ""Play All.""  And as much as I still enjoy the cartoons, I just can't justify a perfect score for a bare-bones release.  Hopefully, WB is seeing that there is still a market for classic animation, and will start putting a little more effort into these releases.  However, if you have fond memories of Speed Buggy, or want to introduce your children or grandchildren to the show, this is definitely worth adding to your collection.",1309392000,21,2482,6.011363636363637

4395523,5,B004K5RN2O,"I have always been a fan of Speed Buggy and am so happy that they finally released the series on DVD.  Speed Buggy reminds me of a very hyper puppy dog. lol  He even wiggles his antenna like a tail! =)  Speed Buggy is about a group of teenagers who have a nutty talking car, Speed Buggy.  You can't help but love that little car.  Anywho, the kids are basically a team who enter Speed Buggy in races and events and they have a garage for Speed Buggy.  In their adventures, they end up thwarting villians along their way.  Villians range anything from cattle rustlers to take-over-the-world types.  To sum up, if you enjoyed Speed Buggy on television through the years, you will more than likely still enjoy it.  I know I have and still do.  My little boy enjoys them as well since they have a ""vroom vroom"" car in the show aka Speed Buggy. lol",1303948800,6,843,4.312101910828026

Mel Blanc was fun as he reprised his Jack Benny Maxwell sputtering vocal effects as the talking dune buggy while prolific voice actor Michael Bell made his animation voice acting series debut as good guy Mark.

The series had aired on all three major US tv networks at the time (CBS, NBC, ABC) in consecutive seasons although with the same 16 episodes from its first season in perpetual rerun.  Too bad, Hanna-Barbera or the networks did not bother to add more to the episode total given its long seasonal run.",1422489600,,771,4.915384615384616
