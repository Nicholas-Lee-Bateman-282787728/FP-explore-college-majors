UPDATE: I received my replacement copy and it did have the digital copy insert as promised. If you don't get your insert, ask for a replacement. :)",1480896000,3,450,4.113636363636363
6758037,1,B00ON0JIKG,"No digital is included on this product!!! The disc case says digital is included, but this is false advertisement.",1480723200,,114,5.052631578947368
6758038,5,B00ON0JIKG,"The one and only, the original, the one from before all the politically correct bits where added into the series, the one you've probably seen a half a dozen times: it is My Big Fat Greek Wedding, one of the best romantic comedies of all time. For a film review, see any one of a number of brilliant reviews written by better reviewers than me. This is a Blu-ray review.

First, the picture. It is wonderful. You wouldn't expect a film made for so little money to look so good on a 1080p transfer but, surprisingly, it holds up remarkably well. The fine details are preserved beautifully while retaining that film quality we all love so much, without too much focusing in on flaws in faces and chips in the paint, as it were. The clarity is balanced with near perfect representation of colors, no color-timing alterations, no re-framing, no fuzzing out in order to make anyone look better in an odd moment or to change the background scenery as too many films are doing to combat high-definition's revelations about the people and places shown in them. This is a beautifully transferred, perfectly preserved time-capsule of a film that has been presented accurately, with an emphasis on clarity and preservation of color and detail. You can see the patterns on the furniture, the flaws in the finish on the walls, the textures of clothing, and it makes a difference in the best way.

And to the audio, to put it simply, the audio is really quite good as compared to a lot of films from this era that were made on shoestring budgets. Given when it was filmed and the technology used at that time, you would expect some muffling and oddly accentuated voices due to the necessary in-studio re-recordings of lines, but no such issues are highlighted in moving to a higher bitrate on the encoding of sound. The voices are clear and the music is lively but the audio has been balanced nicely so as to avoid those common pitfalls.

The disc itself  has nice bonus features, including interview footage with the two lead actors concerning their journey in promoting this film back when no-one had ever heard of it and, on the version we purchased, it came with an ultraviolet (digital HD) copy that we can put on when we (usually just me) are stuck in the kitchen for an hour or two, wishing for something to cast a happier tone over the evening. For the money, if you enjoy romantic comedies or family oriented entertainment, this is about as good as it gets but, for the disc quality, this gets five stars independent of the film. The picture and audio are excellent on this and the added features, though not extensive, are a nice bonus.

Also, going back to the film, because the film was so good, this disc is watchable more than once. It is suitable for youngsters, although it does deal with implied adult relations, in the context of falling in love and getting married. I would say that, if your kids are young, you may want to watch it first by yourself before showing it to them, just in case anything in it conflicts with your personal moral standards, but that is always good advice for any film. Good luck finding what you are looking for.",1480636800,5,3145,4.579040852575488
6758039,1,B00ON0JIKG,"Just received today! NO UV/iTunes DIGITAL CODE in the case as there customarily is and, despite the clear mention on both the front and back of the case. Looked at menu within Disc and there was no mention of code (although that ""could"" become a Studio's option) or, a link to the Studio Website that would register the UV/iTunes. I am returning hoping the next delivery is complete with UV/iTunes Code Sheet.",1480550400,5,409,4.694444444444445
