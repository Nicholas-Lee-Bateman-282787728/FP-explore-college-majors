8697392,1,B00S5M3NLI,"Really horrible! It's like they filmed a treatment for a movie, rather than take the time to develop a script. It opens with scenes from the first movie, which is a good sign this movie is going to suck. It's nothing but scenes of stuff happening with horrible exposition dialogue. That's All it is, exposition dialogue and really bad expositional monologues! What makes it even worse is that they seem  to have overdubbed a bunch of scenes with corny unnecessary b.s. during post production. The music is truly awful too. They took what was great about the fist Nuke 'Em High and made a terrible Hollywood interpretation of what a Troma movie is. Don't be like me, spend your money on something else.",1444867200,,701,4.699186991869919
