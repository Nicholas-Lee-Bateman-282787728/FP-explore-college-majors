8629829,4,B00H4DXTBI,"By some people, this may be considered kind of a mess of a SOV flick.. It's a documentary of FX filmmaking within a movie. In the beginning, you hear a voice over narrator talk about why people go to see horror films, and he talks and shows a film crew with the various jobs they have in making a movie. A lot of times, you'll see a gory scene from a film with music; however, once the scene is over, the narrator will then talk and show you how the FX work was accomplished from that same scene from behind the scenes. The various gory FX scenes consisting of stuff like graphic dismemberments, a head explosion and other gore are not a compilation of scenes from other films that you can buy; these gore FX sequences are made for this SOV flick only. Basically, the entire thing consists of the following: you see scenes with music from the films that this crew is filming; the voice over narrator shows and discusses how the FX work is done for these scenes from behind the scenes; and there's this guy who's somewhat of a mutant called ""Fang"" that's on the film crew and is shown between the scenes. There's various topless scenes in the entire thing, and there's one good scene with a really good looking woman fully nude and screwing a mutant. During the climax, there's a shootout sequence that's labeled as ""Amazons VS Mutants"" in this DVDs chapter selection. Once this sequence ends that ""Fang"" guy is shot and disappears, and then the flick ends. The entire thing just goes from one sequence to the next and is never slow, and the directing and music is pretty good. That being said, it might get tedious and uninvolving to some. I personally thought it was just fun, and there's nothing complicated about it because it's basically just one visual scene of some sort after the next.

It was shot-on-video decades ago, so the quality is what you might expect and isn't really clear. I got the first pressing from Slasher Video with the white case, but it's now being released again. You get a decent amount of extras as well.",1441411200,,2034,4.512195121951219
