Today we have many entertainers (athletes actors, etc), talk show hosts and well as everyday people like myself who are not taking heed to the meaning of living in God's Grace. Every minute of everyday He give His believers a chance to tell others about His Son, Jesus Christ and He gives unbelievers a chance to accept His Son as their personal Savior.  Unfortunately the world in general does not think it can be done without getting drunk, high, pornagraphy, bad language, berating others, etc.
On Friday evening May 16, 2002 I visited some friends' home who introduced me to Sister Cantaloupe's video, ""Laughing Out Loud With the Lord.""
I'll tell you something, I got high off of laughing at this sister.  I honestly fell in love with Sister Canteloupe!  I can't tell you when I've laughed so hard and long to such clean humor....
Sister Cantaloupe is truly a testimony of Amazing Grace at this day and time!
I pray that the character of Sister Cantaloupe will continue!
Spiritual Peace to everyone....",1021680000,8,1230,4.76056338028169
7890588,5,6305507384,"My sister's church had a bus ride to Mohegan Sun and I wanted to see the place so I purchased a ticket and went for the ride.  A friend of one of the ladies on the bus brought the video along ""Laughing Out Loud With The Lord"" starring Sister Cantaloupe, who is truly a funny lady. It is so nice to have a fun clean comedian who can keep you laughing for 76 minutes and not have to listen to ""undesirable language"".  You can relate to her remarks especially when it comes to certain things that happen in the Church. Everyone on the bus enjoyed the video so much that many of us ask where we could purchase it.  Well needless to say I ordered mine from Amazon.com and then my sister ask me to order her one, which I did. After showing the video to our Nephew, he ask me to order him one.  Thank you Sister Cantaloupe for showing us how to ""Laugh Out Loud With The Lord"" and providing us with food that is so healthy and good for all to share.
May God continue to show you the way to keep us laughing and provide food for our souls. We need you in New York for the lost souls here.  ""God Bless You""
