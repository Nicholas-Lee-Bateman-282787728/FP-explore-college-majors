1885001,2,B00009MEKL,"Three years ago, in the movie, ""Almost Famous,"" Frances McDormand played a wise but overprotective mom who, at her wits' end, bemoaned the fact that rock stars kidnapped her son. Now, in ""Laurel Canyon,"" she turns the tables on that scenario, seizing the opportunity with great, obvious and sexy relish.
McDormand plays Jane, a frisky, reckless, fortysomething music producer who strolls around her expansive Southern California spread in worn leather pants and an AC/DC T-shirt. She's a little like Sheryl Crow ... or at least what Sheryl Crow tries really, really hard to be.
Jane, who starts her days with bong hits and Steely Dan, is having a fling with Ian (Alessandro Nivola), a singer 16 years her junior, and her lifestyle is hardly harshed at all when she's visited by her son Sam (Christian Bale) and his fiancee Alex (Kate Beckinsale).
The couple is just out of medical school, wracked by premarital anxiety, and they are forced to move into Jane's rowdy house while Sam starts his residency and Alex writes her dissertation. Alex is studying ""the reproductive behavior of the fruit fly,"" while uptight Sam seems overtly depressed by the fact that his mom is cool enough to have framed photographs of herself with David Bowie and Iggy Pop.
Couldn't such serious, studious kids find a calmer place to stay than in what appears to be a successful sub-franchise of the Hotel California? Probably. But then there wouldn't be a movie.
As time passes and the lazy afternoons and pool-lit evenings add up, tension grows between Sam and Jane.  Sam starts to become attracted to a co-worker (Natascha McElhone). And Alex gravitates into Jane's world and starts to become attracted to, well, a couple of different people. And then things get really complicated.
Unfortunately, things also slow down to a bit of a crawl.  ""Laurel Canyon"" was written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko, whose previous movie was ""High Art,""  a film which was also about a sultry, enigmatic artist surrounded by chaos and lots of chill-time. It, too, was slow-paced and atmospheric. But it also had several really strong performances pushing the movie along, and ""Laurel Canyon"" only has two - McDormand and Nivola, who are both excellent but must support a somewhat sluggish, underwritten movie by themselves. They almost pull it off.
Christian Bale, usually a highlight in a movie, gets bogged down playing the moody, resentful son. It's hard to sympathize with a character who, when torn between Kate Beckinsale and Natascha McElhone (the definition of a win-win decision), can't get out of the dumps long enough to at least crack a smile.  He has to be the drag, the person who dislikes the most magnetic, charming element of the film.  So the deck is kinda stacked against him.
Which makes me think: Maybe ""Laurel Canyon"" should've been the movie in which rock stars kidnap Frances McDormand's son. If Stillwater, the band from ""Almost Famous,"" had somehow dragged grouchy Sam off on their tour bus before he moved back in with his mom, McDormand could've had the entire movie to herself, and ""Laurel Canyon"" would've been a much more exciting place to hang out for a while.",1052611200,19,3157,4.937853107344632
1885002,5,B00009MEKL,"I did not think I was going to enjoy this film as much as I did. However, with an incredible actress like Frances McDormand in the lead role, the film was really interesting. Its a great story built around the Hollywood Music industry, with McDormand's character being a record producer. And the conflicts that she has with her son, who is a doctor. It is a very gripping family drama told Hollywood-style.",1052092800,6,406,4.652777777777778
1885003,5,B00009MEKL,"I watched this movie Friday night, and got the same feeling that I did when I watched 'Pushing Tin', only it ran deeper.  I say it was just like 'Pushing Tin' in the sense that it had the theme of just letting go of everything.  We, as human beings, need to screw up.  We live our lives being told what not to do, and sure, we accept it.  But what if we actually make the mistake?  It means so much more to us than the 10,000 times we've been told not to make that mistake.  This movie charachterizes the misguided millions in college today.  Successful, but they've never experienced failure.  Thus, they aren't truly successful.  And yes, the movie does leave you hanging at the end, boo hoo.  Yet, I find that thought-provoking: it leaves room for imagination.  Isn't that what a good movie is supposed to do, besides entertain?  It gets 5 stars from me.",1052006400,3,857,4.423076923076923
1885004,3,B00009MEKL,"I find that the story base of this movie is only average and at around the end of the movie, Sam accuses Ian of having sex with her girlfriend Alex which was soon 'resolved'(if I review the story, it will not be nice to watch). Alex and Sam is having sex on the opeing shot of the movie and there sre no other sex scene appear during the movie.",1051747200,,344,4.0
1885005,2,B00009MEKL,"as we head cheerfully back to recreate the '70's in La-La Land? There is the free-thinking, drug-taking mom, who nonetheless does have a superb work ethic and reputation as a music producer.  There is her overachiever, uptight son, back for a visit in a family house he thought was vacant.  There is the son's girlfriend, unsure of her relationship with him, uncertain of her own worth.  There is the rock star, younger lover of the mom, way too sure of himself and for no good damn reason for his music is pretty much a milkshake of every big-haired arena band from the 70's, except his hair is short because we're in the 21st century now.  There is the son's new potential love interest, a gorgeous and icy medical student who spends most of the movie struggling unsuccessfully with what is supposed to be an Israeli accent (I thought she was Russian).
So why sit through nearly two hours of this?  Well, Frances McDormand is just as wonderful as she always is and has lots of fun with what she has to know is a ridiculous character and story.  Everybody in the cast is easy on the eye -- this is, after all, Southern California, and the cinematography makes you want to move there in a minute, all gorgeous skies, nights and canyons, but of course -- at least in my case -- you are not easy enough on the eye to qualify for such a move.  Christian Bale, for example, looks better in and under water than Dustin Hoffman did in The Graduate, a movie to which Laurel Canyon aspires to be a mirror image.
Final wrap -- Laurel Canyon is all surface, has an aversion to substance, but in an almost 3 star way, a good night's entertainment for those with low expectations.",1050192000,4,1668,4.467105263157895
1885006,4,B00009MEKL,"This is the story of a free-wheeling, pot smoking Los Angeles record producer (the exquisite Frances McDormand), with a rock star boyfriend (Alessandro Nivola), whose straight-laced son (the yummy Christian Bale) comes back home after graduation from Harvard Medical School with his rich fianc (the beautiful Kate Beckinsale), who's trying to write her dissertation. Although mother and son are initially at odds, their relationship begins to change when he discovers that his bride-to-be likes his mother's rock-n-roll lifestyle too, much to his utter dislike.
""Laurel Canyon"" is director Lisa Cholodenko's follow-up to her 1998 indie hit ""High Art,"" which I have yet to see. It cleverly delves into the hectic world of hipster artists, with all the accompanying ego, self-involvement and drama. It offers an engaging and thouroughly entertaining glimpse into the lives of musicians nestled in the titular Hollywood Hills enclave, making a fascinating ensemble piece with brilliant performances from the entire 'to die for' cast.
... tension is everywhere, and Cholodenko uses it not for mere titillation, but to underscore the idea that art and artists fill deep voids in the world - they're just fun to be around. The writing is both smart and humorous. Not only is the Brit-flavored, alt-rock soundtrack winning and authentic, but ""Laurel Canyon"" itself feels musical: languid, rich in color and light, and deliciously sensual.
""Laurel Canyon"" isn't perfect, but it sure as hell is enjoyable. See it for Frances McDormand's delicious performance, if for nothing else.",1049500800,5,1571,5.416326530612245
1885007,5,B00009MEKL,"Any film with Frances McDormand is a film worth seeing. Her ability to crawl inside the very cells of a character and transform herself is nothing less than awe inspiring. This time out, she is the artist/hedonist mother of the uptight son who has spent his life being embarrassed, even ashamed of the woman. Mother Jane is a hugely successful record producer and son Sam's entire life has been lived in ongoing rejection of his mother's free-wheeling, free-loving chaotic-seeming existence. Director Cholodenko (of the powerfully affecting High Art) offers here an examination of how a child's view of the life around him--which may or may not be accurate--can shape the adult he becomes. In a stroke of inspired casting, Sam and fiancee Alex (the unspeakably beautiful Kate Beckinsale) are both British actors playing American. Given the famous historical inhibition of the British, it's wonderfully appropriate that these two are playing constricted Americans who, without conscious awareness of it, are seeking to escape the self-imposed constraints of their lives.
There is so much that is wonderful about this film that it's difficult to nail down any one area for praise. But Alessandro Nivola as the English lead singer of the group whose record Jane is producing is magically charismatic--drawing not only Jane into the warmth of his charm but Alex as well. It's easy to see the appeal of his easy-going character. Director/writer Cholodenko takes us on a little tour of the psyches on hand and shows both how easy and how hard it is to break out of the habits and reactions of a lifetime. She manages to shoot a dart into the mythical notion that all rock musicians are ignorant louts. In one of the most delicious scenes, PhD candidate Alex is asked about her dissertation by one of the musicians who are lounging in Jane's living room--looking every bit the collective image of dissoluteness. Alex reluctantly, haltingly offers the title, and one of the musicians says, in effect, ""Don't be shy. We've all been to college."" And another paraphrases/distills the lofty issue down to: ""Oh, right. The sex life of fruit flies."" It's a gorgeous, signal moment that perfectly illustrates how dangerous it is to enter into anything with preconceived notions. And it is the alluring shock of pot-smoking, loose-limbed, hairy musicians actually having superior intelligence that is the beginning of Alex's emotional emancipation. Then there's Natascha McElhone as a fellow medical resident into whose car Sam nearly collides at the film's opening--a nice metaphor for their later, gentle collisions. With irony abounding, director Cholodenko shows Sam working with a disturbed young man and his mother--able to go to the heart of the issue with an incisive clarity he finds so difficult in his own relationships. A great way of illustrating why so many shrinks go into the field: in order to comprehend their own issues. All in all (aside from the penultimate scene which required a fair amount of discussion by the three of us who saw this together as to the director's intention--because for the duration of the scene, it feels as if the wheels suddenly came off) this is a fine, funny, deeply thoughtful film. And the linchpin, the glue, the focal point of it all is the ever fascinating, remarkably gifted Frances McDormand.
Most highly recommended.",1049155200,7,3356,5.081521739130435
1885008,3,B00009MEKL,"Are creative freedom and morality mutually exclusive?  Jane's Harvard/UCLA psychiatric resident son Sam believes they are (Frances McDormand and Christian Bale) and that his legendary record producer mother -- homes in Laurel Canyon and Malibu -- is ""developmentally disabled,"" if not personality disordered.  He is the sexual but responsible adult he believes she is not.  When they find themselves temporarily sharing the Laurel Canyon house with her current lover and his band, Sam tries to protect his brainy MD/PhD fiancee from her ""scene"" and keep order in their lives.  The ultimate mother-son betrayal unfolds; he discovers that authentic love, freedom and morality just might not be as easy to attain as he thought and how passion for life and your work can create tempting and messy emotional attachments with colleagues.  Now what?  We can hope he won't go under and drown in his confusion, taking his fiancee with him.  Laurel Canyon is a touching and memorable love note to the paradoxes of creative, hedonistic LA -- and to the unique problems of some boomer/Gen X-Y relationships -- with pitch perfect intimate acting by a well cast ensemble, including by the Hollywood Hills and the infamous Chateau Marmont.  Hard to pull off for the subject matter, the original music is actually beautiful and satisfying.  Close to the bone with a near documentary feel that's likely more the effects of suffering a tight budget; flawed pacing and character development, but thumbs up.

1885048,4,B00009MEKL,"Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll make for great music... but not so great as an environment for a kid.

And it might make things a little awkward when you bring your fiancee home to meet your free-loving hippie record-producer mom. But ""Laurel Canyon"" doesn't lapse into obvious comedy -- instead it's a somber, wry little drama about the nature of desire, infidelity, family and whether your fiance can forgive you for making out with his mother. Not kidding.

Sam (Christian Bale) and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) are newly engaged, and are planning to move to Los Angeles  so Sam can start his psychiatry residency at a hospital, and Alex can work on her PhD dissertation. Fortunately Sam's mother Jane (Frances McDormand) has an empty house in Laurel Canyon where they can live and work peacefully.

Except... it turns out that Jane is still there, along with her younger boyfriend Ian McKnight (Alessandro Nivola) and his band. So until Sam and Alex can find a place of their own, they have to stay with her.

And it doesn't take long for friction to form between Sam and Jane, who have radically different ways of seeing the world. Sam also finds himself attracted to another resident, Sara (Natascha McElhone) -- unaware that Alex is slowly being drawn into his mother's rock'n'roll world, including a burgeoning attraction to Ian.

""Laurel Canyon"" is an odd little movie -- it floats through the world of family, rock'n'roll, romantic attraction (with or without follow-ups) and learning to love your weird dysfunctional relatives. But the most important part is the question of what a wild, free-spirited life can do to your relationship with your kid, if you never really got to know them.

Director Lisa Cholodenko handles the drama with a delicate touch; there's no mockery of the aging hippie or her uptight doctor son, and none of the people involved ever descends into parody. There's a fair amount of humor (Sam trying to deal with a naked mental patient), but whenever the action shifts back to Laurel Canyon, there's a sense of bittersweetness -- despite the bright flowers, weed and airy freedom, it's full of people who either can't interact normally or don't know how.

And the actors really do a brilliant job here, particularly Bale and McDormand. While McDormand is clearly too young to play Bale's mom, she does a brilliant job with a fiercely independent, free-spirited woman who lives life according to her own rules, but wasn't a great mom because she just doesn't understand that her son is different from her.

Bale is also excellent playing the son she simply can't understand, a strait-laced young doctor who craves normalcy and quiet. It also has some solid performances by Nivola and Beckinsale. The latter hams it up at the climax, but she is otherwise pretty believable as a girl who has lived her whole life in a tidy, clean WASP box, and goes kinda nuts when she's shown the alternative.

But Cholodenko does cop out a little on the ending, when Alex's flirtations with the wild side lead to a nasty confrontation. Without revealing too much, nothing really comes of anyone's actions by the end -- it just sort of sputters out like a blown-out candle.

""Laurel Canyon"" never quite deals with some of the messy scenarios in it, but it's otherwise a smart, clever little drama about family, sex and the balance between responsibility and living free.",1366243200,,3374,4.881118881118881

Bale plays the seemingly depressed son who has an uptight girlfriend played by Backinsale sharing the house unexpectedly with mom and the rock band she's recording. If you guessed that someone one gets liberated, then there's no surprise. Bale's character is so pouty he seems almost in slow motion. In fact after it gets interesting, Bale's big scene at a crossroads  slows it down with his interning colleague and conflict interest, Natascha McElhone. McDormand playing  out of character is pretty convincing and the rocker played by Alessandro Nivola is quite good.

1885064,3,B00009MEKL,"Every scene that involves the life portrayed by Frances McDormand is engaging. Here is a woman with a fascinating life. She has been long successful in a tough business. She spends her days in pursuit of artistic goals. She is surrounded by interesting, artistic, attractive, quirky people. She lives in a stunning house with lush gardens, a pool, and its own recording studio. She is white hot.

Then there is her son, as played by Christian Bale. Every scene about his life is deadly boring. As soon as the movie leaves the McDormand world, it collapses. Bale's hospital life is a totally different movie, and, frankly, who cares? His flirtation with another hospital worker? Seen it a zillion times, and done better. Not only am I bored by this character and his life, but I do not even like Bale's performance.

The beauty of DVDs is that I now simply flash-forward through all scenes with the Bale character. When McDormand returns the movie springs back to life, electrically. I am happy.",1286755200,,994,4.807017543859649
1885065,3,B00009MEKL,"...for some reason the development of the character in this movie played by Kate Beckinsale really bothered me. For one, it seemed unrealistic for someone so smart to change like that (and so quickly). And secondly, it bothered me because of what and who she became atrracted to (and I mean both of them!). Quite honestly, it sickened me. It was like watching an ideal woman slumming it with a total degenerate. I had to turn it off for a minute or two. Maybe the intent was to generate this kind of reaction, but more likely it was an atempt to glamourize a lifestyle certainly outside of the traditional moral and acceptable norms. Smart people know that there is more to life than rock n' roll. Other reviewers have said more. Replace Beckinsale with Lindsay Lohan and it would have played differently for me.

As for Frances McDormand, she is wonderful as always and the main reason I purchased this.",1284595200,4,904,4.65
1885066,4,B00009MEKL,"Not sure if the pucture is intended as a nostalgic look-back at the LA Rock scene of the 1970s, or as a study of those still in that lifestyle at the millenium, somehow surviving all the changes, wondering if it's a problem to deliver to the Record Company, a late product...and a ballad on top of that!

Frances McDormand plays the aging Mother Earth/Producer, still indulging in illegal drugs and ""boy toys"". Strangely, it's her Conservative son, who has graduated Medical School in the Ivy's who is a kind of stabilizer. Not really.

Christian Bale is the young guy, trying to get established in the CA Medical Community; and keep his relationship with equally straight-laced, live-in lady friend Kate Beckinsale, who is working on her thesis in Biology.

Frances' wild spirit is infectious and Christian loses focus and struggles to contain his lust for Natashka McElhone, a co-worker, Professional, who drives Chris to and from work - Kate is supposed to be studying *and* checking out a more appropriate place to shack than Frances' Laurel canyon place which has become a Recording Studio as well as a home, so she has the car during the day.
I guess. (Did I notice the actor who played the Proctologist on ""Seinfeld"" as the home seller in one scene?).

Kate notices that Natashka  has an eye for Chris and this makes her curious about her own passions - she is fascinated and sexually attracted to Frances and Ian, the British Rock Star who is half-heartedly interested in completing the album and very interested in completing a menage a tois with Frances and Kate.

That's enough detail for now. See the movie for how things work and don't work out. McDurmond's performance is Oscar-worthy. All the actors are fine. Script and Direction is very strong, as a lesser company might have delivered something alot more in the soap-opera vein. Though there is an issue: are we to be repulsed or amused by by the latter-day ""Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll"" - is Frances just an immature middle-aged hippie? Is Kate dumb enough to xperiment with the worst of that culture? Is Christian, as a Doctor, dumb enough *not* to protest Kate's pot-smoking?",1276905600,2,2148,4.8075880758807585
1885067,2,B00009MEKL,"Laurel Canyon, at best, comes off like a pilot for a cable drama series.  It's positioned better for TV, because the characters are cardboard and not very deep.  It's a small screen with close ups of talking heads vehicle.  You could be watching it in a hospital room with half your brain and body paralyzed and never be lost in the Hanna Barbera obviousness of the script.

The British fellow with designs on having a 3-way (or should I say ""sexual awakening"", as this clearly aspires to be somewhere in the vicinity of daring amoral art) with McDormand and Beckinssale is about as charming as a bloodsucking flea. And we're supposed to feel what towards him? --lovable rogue?  You could watch him run over by a truck and you wouldn't care.  Too bad that didn't happen.

Ah, but in the end, vagaries give way to a tidy feel-good ribbon closure, interdependent life lessons, and one huge steamy pinched off loaf of an ending.  Perhaps it was calculated to end in an unsatisfying way to tip off that we're dealing with a director with the stature of Kubrick who leaves us with ever more riddles about the haze of the human condition itself.  Yes, that's modernity folks and you better get used to it!  Or unchecked hack writing, whichever you prefer.

I'm left to vomit in quantities that would fill that swimming pool five times over.

I did enjoy the featurette interview, however exhaustive, with director Lisa Cholodenko.  Most directors get to where they are by being good communicators and Lisa is no exceptions.  The problem is that no amount of referencing or giving kudos to hard working cast and crew translates into a satisfying product.  Hollywood, by nature, loves to be self-congratulatory but I still stand by the cliche that nobody in Hollywood really knows what they're doing  --which actually means that something impossibly good might be produced too!  But no amount of obligatory deconstructive spin can prop up such weak material.",1260144000,3,1950,4.825301204819277
1885078,2,B00009MEKL,"I'm not quite sure what to say about this film, really.  On paper, it looks excellent - great cast, potentially interesting story line, pretty solid reviews.  But there is nothing that comes as a surprise in this film; it's all way too predictable.  Loose, ex-hippie record producer mom, tense son who's become a psych student because his mom raised him in such a chaotic home, absurdly intelligent and equally absurdly attractive girlfriend who's naive to the ways of the world and is ripe for the plucking by a herd of hedonists, self-absorbed rock musicians who live in a parallel universe of sex and drugs...it goes on and on.  Every event's outcome is telegraphed a mile away, every plot twist is obvious and stereotypical, every character behaves exactly the way you think they'll behave.  Honestly, I'm not sure why an actor the caliber of Frances McDormand would choose to take on this role, but perhaps she just enjoyed the chance to play sexy and bohemian while she still can.  Ultimately, it was a nice film to look at - and, as I said, the cast is exceptional - but it's much ado about nothing.",1256083200,3,1106,4.704663212435233
1885079,4,B00009MEKL,"I discovered this film as I have been going through Frances McDormand's body of work. I only began to really pay attention to her after Fargo (loved her, mostly hated the film - just not my cup of tea), and recently went completely nuts over her in ""Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day."" After Pettigrew, I started watching every one of her films I could get my hands on. I can't say enough about how powerful she is on the screen, and I am way at the back of a long line of admirers.

In this movie, McDormand plays Jane, a semi-famous record producer in LA, and Christian Bale plays her son, Sam. He has been at Harvard finishing medical school and gets a position at a medical institute in Los Angeles (LA). Bringing his rather sheltered East Coast girlfriend Alex (Kate Beckinsale) along, he goes to LA thinking his mother will be at her beach house so he and Alex can stay at her Laurel Canyon residence until they get set up with a place of their own.

Unfortunately for the plan, the record Jane is producing is taking longer than she thought it would, and the young couple find themselves in the midst of Jane's world of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll. Needless to say, all manner of comedic and personality fireworks ensue.

This is a good character driven film, with lots of interesting, although somewhat predictable, situations as each person ""goes through their changes,"" as a friend of mine who lived in LA used to say. The characters seemed familiar and quite real, and reminded me of more than a few people I have known. I found it all quite believable and immediately cared about the characters and the story.

There is nudity (including McDormand's sweet body), drug use, and serious swearing, so be forewarned. If that bothers you, then you probably won't like this movie. There are all manner of emotional conflicts and ""cognitive dissonance"" as the two worlds collide, including parent/child issues, fidelity issues, forbidden fantasy issues, and so on. It is a rich tapestry and it is all handled rather well, which is a nice change from most films, with their predictable mainstream Hollywood preaching.

Of course, I could rant on and on about McDormand, having become quite smitten of late with her and her work, but I won't bore you with that. Everyone does a great job: Alessandro Nivola as Jane's new lover and musical find, Nastacha McElhone as a resident at Sam's new workplace with designs on Sam, and the musicians, who are an actual band. The music was really played by the band, and Nivola really did the singing, which added a great deal to the realism.

The extras on the DVD, including writer/director's commentary and making-of featurette, are interesting and fun.

A great film, highly recommended.",1242432000,,2729,4.732631578947369

[What happens during a fire?] We see a strange household and hear strange conversations. They are working at home to avoid expenses for rented business space.

Your girlfriend Alex, who is supposed to be finishing up her dissertation on fruit flies having sex (Kate Beckinsale) ends up making out with your Mom; Jane (Frances McDormand) a record producer and her rockstar boyfriend. Sam (Christian Bale) Kate's boyfriend; is a psychiatrist working with Sara (Natasha McElhone), and they're attracted to each other. Does any of this make sense?

The uptight student delays her dissertation, starts smoking grass and hanging with a bunch of lousy rockers and Christian Bale's Mom and boyfriend. Then the two psychiatrists get drunk, kiss and don't do it.

We go back to the studio (after Frances McDormand tells her boyfriend she liked kissing her son's girlfriend), which is in the house. Uh, well then the stoner alcohol-guzzling rockers go to a party, then Bale and McElhone sit in car taking about how each other would taste during sex. Still don't do it because Sam feels guilty, but Sara doesn't. In fact Sara just wants to have sex with Sam with no attachments.

I think this Lauren Canyon thing has to do with the book I read about Joni Mitchell, the Eagles, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, groupies, etc., living in that neighborhood. Pffft! This movie turns very predictable after 60 minutes. I don't know why I even wasted time doing this. You won't find this helpful at all.",1221436800,2,1358,4.895652173913043

1885083,3,B00009MEKL,"Sam (Christian Bale) is serving an internship as a psychiatrist while his fianc&eacute;, Alex (Kate Beckinsale) is finishing her dissertation on genomes. They plan to stay at Sam's mother (Frances McDormand) Jane's plush Laurel Canyon house while she is away. Jane is there after all, much to Sam's chagrin, because she is a record producer, and is trying to finish a project, and is also involved in a fling with Ian McKnight (Alessandro Nivola), the young lead singer of the band whose record she is ostensibly producing. Now we see why Sam is so uptight, as his mother's shenanigans make him very uncomfortable, and perhaps the reason he became a doctor was to rebel against his mom's slacker lifestyle. His discomfort is about to evolve into a full-fledged nightmare as Alex falls under the sway of his mother's libertine lifestyle. Meanwhile, Sara, a beautiful Israeli who is also an intern at the asylum, is trying to seduce him, but he resists...

Directed and written by Lisa Cholodenko, she based the character of Jane on Joni Mitchell. Joni is seen in a photo along with McDormand, and other photos show Bowie with McDormand, or Frances McDormand with The Red Hot Chili Peppers, which is no doubt meant to establish Jane's credentials as a record producer. There is even a cameo where real-life record producer Daniel Lanois (U2, Bob Dylan, etc.) is seen.

Besides the five main characters, a sixth character is the location: Laurel Canyon. Some establishing shots make pains to not only show the Laurel Cyn street sign, but also one for Mount Olympus, an actual street name, but also one that seems to mock the inhabitants and their lofty view of themselves for living in such a groovy place. The Laurel Canyon ""vibe"" is captured quite convincingly, one of the films strengths.

While a good effort, and an entertaining movie to watch, Cholodenko could have done a better job writing and directing. An introspective character study made from material that could've better suited a comedy, it is a series of small epiphanies that don't really amount to much. What are you trying to say, Cholodenko? Judging from other viewer's comments, no one got the ending. The character of Alex was thinly drawn, and her actions didn't ring true. Sam was also rather one dimensional, or at the most, two dimensional. Ditto for Sara, and Ian. Jane, the libertine mother, partially makes up for it with a brassy and bold performance. Alex and Sara are both very appealing, but Ian is repulsive, and Sam is a major wet blanket.

I don't want to spoil the movie, but there is a very unusual love triangle, or love polygon, and when it actually almost happens, I thought it would be hot, but it was over the line, and I was repulsed by it. At least it stirred up my emotions, albeit in a negative way, but then it didn't know what to do with them. All undressed up and nowhere to go.

At the same time, however, Sam is madly infatuated with a drop-dead gorgeous foreign second-year-resident at his job.

Frances McDormand carries the entire film as the aging hipster mom (she's hot, she's rock n' roll, and she doesn't give a damn what anyone else thinks), but the brilliance of her acting job is counterbalanced by the one-dimensional nature of the fiance/future daughter-in-law character.  The viewer is never convinced of Alex's attraction to Jane's sex, drugs, and rock n' roll lifestyle.  For that matter, the viewer is never convinced of Sam's attraction to his co-worker on anything other than an animal lust nature, which seems to go against everything Sam stands for.

McDormand plays a woman who finally matures in her late forties, and who, by the end of the film, has taken baby steps to repair her relationship with her son.

The film stars Oscar Winner Frances McDormand (Best Actress, Fargo) as Jane, a record producer who lives on Laurel Canyon. Christian Bale (Batman Begins) stars as Sam, Jane's son who happens to be a doctor. Kate Beckinsale (Underworld, The Aviator) plays Alex, Sam's fiancee. Anyway, for a reason I forget; Sam and Alex move into the house with Jane, who appears to be (what to me would be) a really cool mom...Sam doesn't see it that way and is worried about Alex's reaction. It doesn't help that a rock star named Ian (Alessandro Nivola, who gives an inspired performance) lives there while he records an album with his band and has sex with Jane. The movie has a few weird turns and goes into quite a few directions; but the dialogue is so good, the acting is so great, and the story is so interesting...It really doesn't matter. I'd say, although this isn't really a good reason, the only downside to the movie was the lack of nudity. But, this is a good movie and I highly recommend checking it out.

1885103,3,B00009MEKL,"It's good to see Frances McDormand dominate this 2003 movie rather than steal scenes in other stars' vehicles like ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""North Country"". With her piercing intelligence and insouciant manner, she is in top form as Jane, a successful, proudly bohemian record producer who lends her Hollywood Hills house to her estranged son Sam and his equally conservative fiancee Alex to occupy while he starts a residency in the psychiatric ward of an LA hospital. Alex and Jane have never met because he is embarrassed by his hippie mother. Much to his consternation and despite Alex's initial need to work on her genomics dissertation on the reproductive habits of fruit flies, the two women start to bond bolstered by the presence of Jane's sixteen-years-younger rocker boyfriend Ian whose record Jane is producing. Meanwhile, Sam finds unexpected chemistry with fellow resident Sara who pursues him with a becalming fervor. The standard romantic complications ensue amid a lot of LA-style partying and the inevitable conflicts that occur between parents and children. Even though the movie has a veneer of appropriate hip-coolness mostly due to Wally Pfister's deft cinematography, the story feels very by-the-numbers with plot developments telegraphed pretty much from the outset and an ending that saps the energy out of the whole venture.

Directed and written by Lisa Cholodenko, the film has lots of vivid images but not enough of a melding between audacity and credibility to make it exceptional. The most far-fetched, underdeveloped element is Alex, as embodied literally by a tentative Kate Beckinsale, who seems ludicrously naive for someone who graduated top of her class at Harvard Medical School and looks like an aspiring supermodel. Luckily the other actors fare better with Christian Bale effectively uptight and unforgiving as Sam, the striking Natascha McElhone using an Israeli accent to much too alluring effect as Sara, and Alessandro Nivola (bearing a certain physical resemblance to Coldplay's Chris Martin) constantly threatening to steal the picture as the hedonistic Ian. Nivola also sings quite credibly as the band's front man. But it's McDormand who conquers the film's potential cliches and predictable story turns with her sexy, free-spirited performance. The DVD is short on extras - Cholodenko's earnest commentary, a few trailers and a twenty-minute making-of featurette that is really just an interview with Cholodenko, who reveals she was inspired to make the film by Joni Mitchell's classic 1970 ""Ladies of the Canyon"" album.",1146614400,4,2574,5.387096774193548

Yes McDormand is an extremely talented actress but there really are no bad actors in this film.  Even Christian Bale is pretty good playing an uptight Harvard doctor in residency, but his actorly limitations come out during the last 10 minutes when he has a dramatic moment with Beckinsale that's more on par with TV-show acting.

The funny thing here is that both Bale and Beckinsale are Brits playing Americans, and Nivola is an American playing a Brit---all 3 do it convincingly with the correct accents.

There were surprisingly a lot of laughs during the first 2/3rds of the film, and if it weren't for the bit of failed melodrama right near the end I would have given this movie 5 stars.  As others have noted, the soundtrack here is excellent---Alessandro Nivola ought to be in a real rock band in real life.",1142812800,3,1100,4.768421052631579

The fact that the British actors (Beckinsale and Bale) play Americans and the American actor (Nivola) plays a Brit is cool and they're utterly convinving. All the performances are uniformly excellent, but Frances McDormand...is beyond brilliant. She's so convincing that I showed this to a friend, and not until the end of the film did I tell him this was the same woman who played Marge Gunderson in _Fargo_...needless to say, he was shocked. This woman can do anything. I'd watch her read the phone book. Why isn't she the lead in more movies, ""independent"" or otherwise?",1140825600,4,663,4.724137931034483
1885107,4,B00009MEKL,"Frances McDormand delivers a superb performance as a middle-aged, free-loving record producer; with a believable sixty's laden sensibility, dragging on joints, sipping on non-stop cocktails and making love to the young English rock star in her swimming pool. Life for this fun-loving hippie seems to be one big party until her son, Sam (Christian Bale) arrives with his girl friend, (Kate Beckinsale) and two lifestyles clash creating some interesting results.

Sam begins his residency at a local hospital as an aspiring psychiatrist. He is a serious young man with something to prove. Having been raised by a flower child mother, sex, drugs and rock and roll all around him, surprisingly, he ends up a Harvard Medical School graduate with definite goals. Sam's girlfriend is also a serious type, a PhD student writing her dissertation on the reproductive behaviour of fruit flies, this beautiful though inhibited young woman begins to enjoy the free-loving lifestyle at the house, revealing a side to her personality that even she was not aware of. This character's transformation from a shy girl to a woman exploring her sexuality is a subtle one but with profound implications.

The relationship between Sam and his mother is strained though on the surface fairly amicable. It is obvious that he thinks she's irresponsible and a bit left-of-centre yet has more or less accepted her for what she is...however, mother complains several times throughout the film that they don't have a ""relationship"" which Sam cannot understand. This film is about relationships that exist on many levels, but more importantly, it is about acceptance, granting people the space to be who they are and to develop into what they could be.

Sam's ordered life is also challenged when he meets a beautiful fellow resident and begins a subtle game of flirtations and innuendo, which drives him to feel guilt for even entertaining the idea of an affair. His guilty behaviour is played-out one night when he comes home after kissing the beautiful doctor, and complains to his girlfriend why they never married and that her father hates him, etc. Bale is an excellent actor, over the past 19 years he has developed a style and method all his own. I believe he is just getting better and better.

Laurel Canyon is certainly no blockbuster or an art house film, but lies somewhere comfortably in the middle. The performances are all first-rate, revealing a subtle transformation in all the characters, leaving the viewer with something to think about.",1136678400,2,2526,5.079518072289156

I just watched this movie on cable & loved it, so I went straight to Amazon to buy it and then I had to write a review once I saw some of the reviews below.

Some of these reviewers are so obviously bitter video store clerks and film school drop outs, who haven't gotten over the fact that they will never have what it takes to get a real movie made.

And, what is with giving away key moments of a movie in the reviews?...this kind of behavior makes you guys as bad as the people that used to give you wedgies and dunk your heads in toilets at school.

I mean come on... one of these reviewers says ""Give me Woddy Allen any day""?...I can't think of a more wannabe fim nerd comment.

You guys don't even have to list where you are from ( Texas? Iceland ?) for it to be obvious that you don't have a clue about the lifestyles depicted in this movie.

This movie was so beautifully shot, beautifully scored, and beautifully nuanced with varying degrees of human nature that it gives me hope that some people in Hollywood can still make movies that take the emotional side of your brain on an introspective ride through a film instead of just the the part of your brain you use to play video games or read comic books.

Christian Bale and Kate Beckinsale play a couple who move to Los Angeles to Los Angeles so Sam (Bale) can pursue his medical residency, and Alex (Beckinsale) can complete her dissertation on genomics. Studious and serious individuals, both of them. They are going to live in Sam's mother's house in Laurel Canyon, thinking Sam's mother (Frances McDormand) is going to be away. She is a famous music producer, and unfortunately her latest project has run over time and she is still at the house when Sam and Alex arrive. Sam is perturbed; he clearly does not see eye to eye with his mother or her reckless lifestyle. Alex, though at first not interested in the rock and roll lifestyle on offer, becomes intrigued and gets a little bit too involved in Jane's (McDormand's) activities for Sam's liking. Meanwhile, Sam is feeling like his relationship has problems, is questioning many things in his life and is distracted by an Israeli intern at the hospital where he works (played by Natascha McElhone). As he nearly begins this affair, Alex grows more and more wrapped up in the ""cool"" lifestyle of Jane. Of course it all leads to a semi-disaster. By watching the film, though, a viewer comes away with nothing. There is nothing remotely interesting about this film apart perhaps from McElhone's pursuit of Bale's character and on occasion, the self-indulgence and insecurity visible in McDormand's character (her desperate need to be ""cool"" and appear young, etc. and the slight hint of jealousy she feels when her younger boyfriend wants to be with Alex.)

This movie is as such, it doesn't seem to pull us in.  As we sat through the commentary about how the movie was made, the Director explained that she could empathise with the cinematographer because both of them worked through the ranks.  Furthermore, she explained that she got so involved in the writing of the story that the direction of the movie came second and that, she had problem in resolving the ending.  Alas, the cinematographer came to the rescue with his suggestion of how the movie should be ended.  Whilst there's no denying that the Director was very detailed in projection of her characters, the course of the story itself was deliberate.  The Director explained that she wouldn't want to make it as-a-matter-of-fact.  Tensions were set up for the purpose of captivating audience's attention.  In the end, we had a promising movie that failed to deliver, that is, capturing the string of our hearts.

1885137,5,B00009MEKL,"This film represents the best in independent filmmaking.  Instead of formulaic plot that's heavy on action and skimpy on the acting, what you get in this film are stellar performances and an interesting story, a sort of look into the complicated life of a rather conservative medical student, Sam (Christian Bale) and his girlfriend Alex (Kate Beckinsale, who looks great as usual) and his somewhat embarrassed relations with his free spirited Record producer mother (Frances McDormand).  While there is little in plot, it hardly matters in a film like this, as the performances take you away into a world most have never seen, namely a record producer's studio in the Hollywood Hills (Laurel Canyon).  The best scenes in this film are when Ian (brilliantly played by Alessandro Nivola in a very convincing British accent) is recording two songs, receiving instant feedback by Alex and Jane (McDormand).  I absolutely love the songs he sings (""Shade and Honey"" and ""Someday I Will Treat You Good"") and rushed out to buy the soundtrack cd after seeing this film in the theater.  In fact, the entire soundtrack is good, and that's another reason why I love this film.

Frances McDormand's performance as a mother more interested in producing a record album than connecting with her son at his personal interests is outstanding and Oscar-worthy.  She's so free spirited and independent, that it wasn't difficult for me to see why the younger Ian was attracted to her in the first place.  She does have her limits though, when Ian wants a threesome with her and Alex, she breaks the mood and explains to him privately why it just wouldn't work.  Alessander Nivola also has the best performance of his career, fooling me into thinking that he was a British actor, not an American one.  He does that great of a job with the accent, and apparently, he's really singing too.  As I watched this film, I was hoping that Alex would dump Sam and end up with him, because they seem well suited to one another.

Sam is the character I felt the most out of place, as I couldn't figure him out.  He flirts with a fellow Med student, almost to the point of cheating, and we just don't get to see much chemistry between Sam and Alex, only that there is something standing in the way of those two, which probably had little to do with the thesis she struggled to write in Jane's house.  The film ends without any kind of resolution, but its okay in a film like this.  Independent films work because they don't follow standard plot rules, so long as the performances are strong (as they are in this film) and the story is compelling.  The ending left me wanting more, but that's better than an ending where I wished they cut it down some.  The musical choices on the soundtrack is the last ingredient that compels me to give this film five stars.  It is a film that I watch regularly (every couple of months or so) and never get tired of doing so.  This film has a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" quality I can't really describe, but compels me to watch over and over.  The director deserves huge kudos for making a film like this, one that focuses on the characters and gives us a small slice of their lives, as incomplete as it is.  Human relationships are often too complicated to be solved in a two hour movie, so I'm glad the director leaves the ending the way it is, with Sam taking a much needed mental health day to clear his head.",1098748800,11,3413,4.5805921052631575

Sam escaped the hedonistic life style of his mother to seek a more responsible spot in the world through attending the Harvard Medical School from which he has recently graduated with a emphasis in psychiatry.  In addition, Sam has furthered his rebellion against his mothers life style by proposing to a beautiful Harvard scientist, Alex (Kate Beckinsale).  The perfectionist Alex moves with Sam to California where she can work on her thesis in regards to fruit flies and Sam can begin his residency in psychiatry.

Alex, who grew up in a rigid life style with country clubs and specific societal rules, are fascinated by Jane's life style and begins to explore the world that she never has experienced, which is about to lead into an emotionally painful journey.
Laurel Canyon is a terrific film about inhibitions, choices, and love, which Lisa Cholodenko embodies through the different characters.  Cholodenko depicts the personal rules of the characters through social interactions between the characters as well as in the mise-en-scene.  These personal rules are about to be broken as the characters are set in a society where rules are not the norm or wanted.  This leads to interpersonal conflicts as it will most certainly hurt the individuals in the social setting in which they live.  The conflicts lead the audience to ponder what is acceptable and desirable in our contemporary society where many different norms exists.

This is not a terrible movie, but those who are talking of Oscar snubs should have seen more movies in 2002. McDormand's performance as a middle-aged record producer is believable enough and pretty well-done. In fact both Bale and Beckinsale also do a pretty good job as the right brained young professionals who simply aren't used to the ""rock-and-roll"" lifestyle.

Boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy gets another girl, boy realizes he misses first girl, boy gets back with first girl. My feeling is that the movie needed a serious disaster or chaotic event to really drive the plotline, but none of the sort is evident.

It is about a pair in love, young doctor Sam (Chrstian Bale) who is going to work in hospital, and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) who is working on a paper (doctorial) about the reproduction system of flies.  The couple  are going to marry soon, and fly to the West Coast where Sam's mother lives.  And it's Laurel Canyon, the place of Joni Mitchell song.
His mom Jane (Frances McDormand) has her own studio where she produces records; lots of golden records are decorated; and Jane and the band led by Ian (Alessandro Nivola, giving his own voice) are still dreaming of Summer of Love, rolling joints as if that's usual.  Alex, serious student of insects. cannot be free from the influence, finding another side of her personality.  In the meanwhile, Sam meets a beautiful Israeli doctor (Natascha McElhone), who is attracted to him, and he to her.
The story is nothing new, and the characters are not particularly interesting except Jane, thanks greatly to McDormand.  Few can play the role of mother, lover, and seducer in one, and McDormand does it so easliy that you may forget that ""Laurel Canyon"" is basically the story about the younger ones, Bale and Beckinsale.  And they are not bad, though I cannot understand the producers' decision of casting two British faces in American situation.
The locations play the vital role.  And they are attractive, including that of Hotel Chateau Marmont.  But somehow there is something off-putting about them, perhaps they are essentially the places for celebrities, where not many ordinary people can approach casually.  I know the story cannot be nowhere else; but the overfamiliar plot and the weak ending betray that except for McDormand's, the characters lack something substantial, like the place the film shows.  In other words, we care little about them.
See this film as Frances McDormand's, and you will not be disappointed.  Lisa Cholodenko is no doubt a talented director, and her previous film 'High Art' starring Radha Mitchell and Ally Sheedy is a quite impressive film about the two lovers, about which we really care.

The cinematography is beautiful and the characters are engaging and likeable, despite their vices.
After seeing the film, I have to admit that I was a bit shocked at some of the things that happened, but after thinking about it, the only way I can describe this film is, ""absolutely beautiful."" Everything about it is rhetorically savvy, with intelligently written parts, and wonderfully developed characters. It is almost as if the creators did a ""mind experiment"" in which well-developed characters, that we can relate to, are placed in uncharacteristic environments so that we may see the implications of one's actions and upbringing.

1885155,4,B00009MEKL,"'Laurel Canyon' is an adult movie in the good sense of the term: strong character development; real-life believable situations; and an ending that jolts you with its abruptness and immediately sets you to thinking.
For all intents and purposes, there are five people in this film:
Frances McDormand - What an actress.  Hard to believe this is Brainerd, Minnesota's sherriff Marge Gunderson up there.  Talk about channeling a character.
Christian Bale - Can't be overlooked here because he's got to be believable as someone who attracts the love interest of both Kate Beckinsale and Natascha McElhone.  [Happens to all guys, right?]
Kate Beckinsale - So good-looking you'd think it would be tough for her to pull off the the brainiac bookworm role, but I never doubted it for a second.
Natascha McElhone - Looks great here as always.  So-called Israeli accent a bit all over the map for this classically trained English actress, pero no me molesta.  Lisa Cholodenko was looking for the allure vs. the uptight Beckinsale portrayal of fiancee Alex.  I was sold.
Alessandro Nilova - Underrated.  I was totally charmed by this guy as Brit rocker Ian McKnight.  As the anti-Sam (Bale), you could see why Beckinsale's character is drawn to him.  Plus, he has movie's goofiest lines.  Like when he picks up the phone when Sarah calls the house:
""That's a lovely accent, Sarah, where are you from?""
[Pause - you don't hear the answer on the screen.]
""Well, what a coincidence, I'm eating a bagel right now.  Hold on, I'll get Sam.""
Sounds idiotic, but by that time, Nivola has established McKnight's harmless chatter and sweet character.
The ending is Cholodenko's gift to the audience.  It's abrupt and completely subject to the viewer's interpretation.  You will immediately find yourself making a judgement as to which of two ways Bale's character will turn.  I did so impulsively.  I bet you do the same.",1081728000,5,1899,4.946372239747634
1885156,4,B00009MEKL,"I wanted to watch this movie because  I like Christian Bale and had heard so much about Frances McDormand's perfomance. I had previously seen the director's film High Art (I enjoyed the film style of High Art, but not the message. However, Patricia Clarkson's turn as a glamorous German lesbian is fantastic.)

 The set-up: a Harvard graduate psychiatrist returns to California to begin his  residency at a mental facility. He plans to stay at his mother's house in Laurel Canyon with his brainiac girlfriend. The house is supposed to be vacated so that he can work and his fiancee can finish her dissertation. However, his mother, a highly successful record-producer, is still living in the house, trying to finish an album with her boyfriend's band. The psychiatrist son, who resents his unorthodox, lonely upbringing, tersely agrees to remain in the house until he and said girlfriend can find another place. The mother is well aware of her son's anger but feels helpless to fix the situation, so she ignores it. The son's girlfriend, a scientist, finds herself attracted to the open and creative lifestyle of her boyfriend's mom and the merry musicians. Finally, the psychiatrist finds himself attracted to another doctor at the hospital.

  I really enjoyed this movie because of the perfomances. Frances McDormand does a brilliant job as the perfect producer who is an imperfect mother. Much was made of the sexuality of the role, but her perfomance was so natural it all works. Christian Bale is remarkable as this son who judges his only parent harshly for her failings. He  rigidly organizes his life only to realize that life is fluid. Alessandro  Nivola, Kate Beckinsale, and Natashcha McElhone have different accents and are wonderful as well. The music ""scene"" depictions are tremendous also(It is like watching a party you want to go to!). It is all very sensual.

 My only criticism is the script function of Kate Beckinsale's  character as some innocent led astray. Even with the son' priggishness, I don't see his fiancee as a nubile object waiting to be defiled. That said, good movie.",1079308800,3,2103,4.994269340974212

Briefly, the film covers the relationship between a young professional couple who have been studying at Harvard played by (Sam) Christian Bale and (Alex) Kate Beckinsale and the lifestyle of Sam's record producer mother Jane (Frances Mc Dormand) and her younger boyfriend Ian (Allesandro Nivola).  The Harvard culture is conservative and polite whereas Jane's Los Angeles culture is uninhibited and hedonistic.  Sam is embarrassed by his mother while Alex is slowly drawn in like a moth to a flame.
The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film.",1078617600,5,1159,5.105820105820106
1885161,4,B00009MEKL,"If you were privy to the Laurel Canyon lifestyle in the 60s and 70s, this film is like a retro shock with all the old familiar haunts still there, and the inevitable lost generation of 20 somethings wandering the deer trail lanes of traffic to hang with the musicians.  At least, this is how the premise of the 2002 version of the canyon lifestyle is reflected.  Between the generation of hippie organic mama (Frances McDormand) and her predictably uptight conservative son (Christian Bale) and his uber egghead grad student girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale) are the silences of a parent who did her thing and a son who didn't.  Literally caught between them is the luscious Beckinsale, who comes to enjoy the hedonism the mother's world of music and a young lover (Allessando Nivola) present.  She likes the pot, pool parties, and 3-somes while her fiance dallies with the sublimated lust for a professional colleague who is more his cup of straight-laced tea.  His resentment of mom's ability to be cool and productive clash with his inability to make decisions about his own lifestyle choice, a serious wife in training, medical practice, and the possibility of affairs with other women.  He is as much drawn to sin and swinging as Kate.  The tension of the six characters makes the story of kids and parents failure to communicate as old as the perennial hills.  Great soundtrack with vocals by Nivola and recording sessions are added  plus.  McDormand is one of the finest character actors around, and she rises to the challenge of taking back seat to Beckinsale's beauty.  Nevertheless, McDormand steals the show everytime she is onscreen.

Hippie counterculture mom, Jane (McDormand), has produced a child, now an adult conservative, Harvard grad, psychiatric intern with an equally proper girlfriend. The young couple move into mom's house, expecting it to be empty, but Jane's still there, in residence with her current lover, a British rocker who's experiencing problems finishing his album. Betrayal and attraction vie for supremacy as the young couple is pulled in opposite directions and struggle with their true natures. Wonderful hang-it-all-out acting by McDormand, and equally wonderful trying-to-keep-it-tight acting by son and girlfriend (Christian Bale and Kate Beckinsale).",1073952000,2,776,5.756521739130434

1885164,3,B00009MEKL,"There is a certain undeniable pleasure in watching bad films, the failed attempts, and then going eloquent about that. It's like reconfirming the codes we all share, feeling yourself to be a one of the species, a member of the quality control board where all the discerning moviegoers are welcome. It's fascinating to read dozens of critics' reviews  which tell you why's this new production falls short of perfection or is no good at all despite all the effort invested - and agree. If you're not going to remember this film as a great - or at least satisfying - cinematic experience you can get your kicks from looking at it from above. Which is also endearing sometimes.
All the failings of Laurel Canyon are self-evident: the plot is ultimately formulaic, everything is so predictable, the antagonisms and temptations are so clichd, the depictions of ""opposing"" lifestyles are unintentional parody. The director's agenda ""appears to be a lesbian-positive theme of openness to experimentation and its accompanying emotional costs"", the tired conflict of hip and square with the only nuance in making the mother a rock'n'roll libertine and the son an uptight conservator. Frances McDormand has to do her best and look convincingly alive and witty with a gems like that:
Alex: We just hadn't planned on a change of plan.
Jane: Well who plans on a change of plan? I mean, that would be sorta paranoid, don't you think?
Most of the time she succeeds - no thanks to the self-important scriptwriting studded with helpless witticisms of the movie's  director Ms. Cholodenko.
The casting is reason enough to see this cinema school excercize and not have any regrets afterwards. I like to watch Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, Natascha McElhone and Alessandro Nivola walk and talk no matter how inferior is the script and directing. These are very beautiful and intelligent people and as an actors they're in a more or less the same category -  underrated.
As much as I agree with the Laurel Canyon's more ardent critics there's a sequence that redeems for me that almost-a-film. The movie's promotional review written for the Cannes festival tells that """"Laurel Canyon"" is a witty film that takes fascinating turns yet contains an unfortunate I-can't-make-up-my-mind-how-to-finish-this ending.""  Well, this ending, these finishing minutes when the director\scriptwriter thankfully dropped her pretense of being in control are one of these thrilling surprises you can sometimes encounter even in the ultimately moderate and uninspired productions.
Everything is kind of resolved, the apologies are accepted, the temptations are withstood, Christian Bale's character sheds the excess vigor swimming in the villa's pool, looking great - and wasted.  That's when he gets a call from an Israeli doctor played by the sultry Natascha McElhone.
He had already closed the door on her. But hearing her voice he realizes there are no closed doors in this life and it's the moment of a very acute inner clarity, he submerges, putting the transparent mass of water between himself and the world above, the music plays and I get in a trancelike state of amazement that has nothing to do with any unhealthy substances readily  available these days, it's the pure enjoyment of art, that can emerge for a couple minutes even from the most helpless drivel.
P.S. As a sucker for quirky details I was greatly amused by the Kate Beckinsale's Alex who - after kissing his boyfriend's mother so lustily in the pool - sports the AC/DC T-shirt during her next morning jog - like a repentant Medieval sinner would wear the robe woven of hair as a sign of the painful regret and a signal to the others to stay back from her doomed self.

1885166,4,B00009MEKL,"I believe that the time you spend thinking about a movie is some indication to how good it was; well, I did spend time thinking about this movie and especially about the characters - what's going to happen next...what is the meaning of the ending... Sara's directness and beauty.
There is a lot of beauty in this film, starting from the physical beauty of the characters moving to their inner beauty and to the fact that they are all ""whole"", complete characters. I agree with other viewers that these characters are somewhat cliched but they seem to develop or unfold as the movie proceeds. Finally there is the beautiful photography of this movie on which the director and screenwriter (Lisa Cholodenko) elaborates in the DVD additions part. An important great asset is ""Laurel Canyon"" ability to handle difficult issues with just a touch, hinting an array of feelings with body gestures and few words (Sam touching Jane toes as an act of reconciliation, Sara's eyes following Sam in the car scene). In this regard I have to add that the movie is very blunt and direct in one sense and quite subtle on the other hand; or maybe it is always easier to be blunt and direct about sex and subtler about other issues of the heart.
I guess the film belongs to Frances Macdermond who is able to put light to every character she does (and what a variety that is). Here she plays Jane, the bohemian musician type who is a living proof to every stereotype there is about the music industry. Still, Frances McDormand is able to give us a fuller person of Jane with a lot more depth to her character. Another fact that I reminded myself during the viewing was that she indeed is the parent of Sam... this means that in spite of Sam' accusations and negative feelings she seemed to have done at least a few things right. Sam is not only very intellectual (Harvard graduate, cool and calculated) but is also a kind human being who is able to give meaning to his role as a doctor.  I also liked Natascha McElhone as Sara and thought she was definitely more ""alive"" then Alex.
The film includes one of the hottest sex scenes ever, although not including anything physical only a conversation between two people sitting in a car.",1071619200,4,2213,4.588383838383838

1885168,3,B00009MEKL,"Lisa Cholodenko's ""Laurel Canyon"" is an exploration of several subjects scandalous: sex, drugs, psychiatry, whiny rock music. Aspiring to a lot, accomplishing very little, it nevertheless reaffirms that Frances McDormand is chameleonic, feisty actress. In a year thin of dynamic female roles, she might even earn an Academy Award nomination.
McDormand is Jane, a 40ish hippie record producer holed up in of those fabulously overgrown villas tucked into the Los Angeles hills, toking bongs and whiskey sours while putting her latest LP to bed. Somewhere in the myriad of short flings she produced a straight-laced son Sam (Christian Bale), a Harvard Med grad with a perky little genius for a fiance in Alex (Kate Beckinsdale).
Predictably, Sam and Alex's routines get rattled when they move in with Jane and her band, fronted by a cocky punk named Ian (Alessandro Nivola). Writer/director Cholodenko immediately places seductive distractions in front of the newly engaged couple; Alex, the (apparent) reigning super-achiever, drops her dissertation, and everything else, to hang in the recording studio and get stoned, while Sam warms to a sweetly aggressive Israeli colleague (Natascha McElhone).
Because ""Laurel Canyon"" never takes the time to cement Sam and Alex's romance beyond a Scrabble game and some uncomfortable sex, there is surprisingly little at risk; both seem better suited to their new friends and surroundings than a stodgy relationship where they talk past one another. Beckinsdale might be the soup du jour, but she's a blank beauty, and McElhone presents a far more fetching, stimulating catch.
As does McDormand, who's got some mileage in those eyes, but a lot more spark, too. Jane is bursting with contradictions, and seems to suffer affairs long past their sell-by date for nuture's sake. When we discover, for example, just why it is she gets up so early every morning, we get a glimpse of how co-opted a supposedly ""free and clear"" existence can become. Essentially a comic role, McDormand infuses the performance with a startling amount of maternal instinct. It's just not for her son.
Bale is McDormand's equal as the sullen prodigy trying hard to deny he has the same roaming tendencies as his mother. Nivola is spot on as the affable creep. The soundtrack is worth owning if you go for British rock pop.
Cholodenko, as writer/director, knows her way around a hotel, a car, and a pool. While the scenes themselves never add up to a cohesive film - the movie is simply too didactic and point-driven - several are sharp on their own. And McDormand simply is her character. After water toting performances in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and ""City By The Sea,"" she returns to ""Laurel Canyon"" brassy and keyed up, and it's like watching a lioness stalk the plains.",1068336000,8,2786,5.071895424836601
1885169,3,B00009MEKL,"***1/2 ""Laurel Canyon"" is an intriguing character-driven drama, written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and featuring first-rate performances by Frances McDormand, Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, Alessandro Nivola and Natascha McElhone.
Sam (Bale) and Alex (Beckinsale) are recent Harvard med school grads who move to Southern California to begin a new phase in their lives, he as a resident in a psychiatric ward and she as a genetics researcher working on her PhD.  While there, the young couple moves in with Sam's mother, Jane (McDormand), an aging, hard-living but highly successful music producer who owns a gorgeous residence (in Hollywood's posh Laurel Canyon) that also doubles as a recording studio.  Sam, an earnest, rigid, almost prudish young man, has long rejected the free-wheeling lifestyle of his mother whom he considers more of an embarrassment than anything else.  The brainy Alex, on the other hand, who graduated first in their highly competitive class, has led a more ""sheltered"" existence and she finds herself strangely drawn to the hedonistic atmosphere she finds here.  Another factor pulling the couple apart is the growing relationship between Sam and Sara (McElhone), the beautiful young resident who works with him at the hospital.  The fifth element in the mix is Ian (Nivola), a smooth-talking, cocky young singer who, though officially attached to the much-older Jane, plays a primary role in getting Alex to loosen up, shed her inhibitions, and come join their little ""party.""
""Laurel Canyon"" plays out like a ""civilized"" power struggle, with the various characters jockeying for position, staking out their territory, and attempting to pull certain key individuals into their own respective corners.  Alex, with her air of nave innocence, is clearly the main ""prize"" here, but Sam also feels a noticeable tug from Sara, who senses in her co-worker a kindred spirit she would like to get to know better.  These are people playing with fire - Jane and Ian in particular - and one of the messages of ""Laurel Canyon"" seems to be that a life conducted without a clear moral code will end up in disaster for all concerned.  However, Cholodenko does not seem exactly enamored of Sam's provincialism either, seeing it as a wall he has constructed in order to hide from the truth of his own nature.
McDormand makes an indelible impression as the intriguing but somewhat pathetic Jane, a woman who's failed as a mother primarily because she's never been able to grow up and accept adult responsibility.  The few encounters we are privy to between mother and son are searing in their intensity, but ""Laurel Canyon"" keeps its confrontation scenes to a minimum, choosing instead to find its meaning in the things that are NOT said rather than in the things that are.  That's a risky strategy that generally pays off, though some in the audience may find the subtlety and lack of a clear-cut resolution unsatisfying and even frustrating in the long run.  The plotting is sometimes a bit too clear-cut and neat for its own good and the parallelism (i.e. the simultaneous drifting apart of Sam and Alex due to their respective ""temptations"") sometimes feels forced and obvious.  The parallelism is less obtrusive in the case of Sam's patient, a 16-year old boy whose drug addiction is placed in stark opposition to the ""casual, recreational"" drug use of Jane and her music-making cohorts.  Moreover, having Sam and Alex be a married couple rather than just boyfriend and girlfriend might have intensified some of the moral complexities and dilemmas faced by the characters.  Still, the caliber of both the acting and the writing keeps us involved for the duration of the film.
""Laurel Canyon"" spins a unique tale in a relatively unfamiliar setting and provides five fine actors an opportunity to display the perfection of their craft.",1068249600,5,3855,5.088748019017433
1885170,1,B00009MEKL,"At several points during the screening of this film I found myself hoping that a catastrophe might overtake the entire cast(Frances McDormand excepted), however neither flood, nor fire, nor earthquake was forthcoming, and it was left to sleep to quell my misery.  For this film is truly miserable; all the more so for having such a promising premiss which, through the neatly produced trailer, had me full, or at least half-full, of expectations.
*
Someone sadly had faith enough to bankroll Lisa Cholodenko, without due supervision of her script, which presents as a rough first draft, that is to say at best a few ideas, a few sketchy scenes, waiting to be developed into a coherent, captivating narrative; the characters are thin to the point of being skeletal, their development 'subtle' bordering on utterly absent, the dialogue stilted and forced, their motivations oscillating between facile cliche and inarticulate opacity.  Frances McDormand does her best to fashion a plausible living character from what she has been given, but even she gives up when asked to smooch Kate Beckinsale - you can almost see her turning to face the camera, and in an aside confiding, ""Yep, this is ridiculous"".  Miss Beckinsale herself quite clearly can make neither hide nor hair of her character, and leaves the film looking as lost as the majority of the audience.  Christian Bale survived the ordeal of filming by dosing himself up on powerful sedatives, the effects of which are plainly evident on screen.
*
The music, obviously so central to proceedings, needs special condemnation.  The idea that the band in question 'lacks inspiration' and 'fails to draw you in', to use Cholodenko's own words, is very dangerous, since this uninsipired music is exactly what the audience is forced to listen to for many a minute.  Tedious, hackneyed, middle-of-road pseudo-British Rock and sort-of-roll does not a great sound-track make.
*
Clearly, this film is not trying to be great art, but I fear it is intended to be entertaining, and in that intention it fails, sleepily if not spectacularly.",1067990400,10,2081,5.0701754385964914

1885172,4,B00009MEKL,"Laurel Canyon is a bit of fresh air. I suppose it was supposed to be sort of a comedy. If it was, it wasn't particularly funny. What it was, was a fairly entertaining situation where a young, conservative doctor, Sam, moves to LA from Boston, where he has taken an internship as a psychologist, bringing with him his bright and beautiful fiancee, Alex, to temporarily live in his mother, Jane's, second home in Hollywood Hills.
However, things do not work out well for Sam. It seems Sam's mother is there, along with an up and coming British band, using the place to try and produce their newest album and especially a radio friendly single. This, because she has given her home in Malibu to her previous husband / lover, it's not clear which.
Let's stop here a second and see what we have.
Sam, played by Christian Bale, is a rather stodgy individual who has always been perturbed by his mothers lifestyle and behavior.
Jane, Sam's Mother, Played by Frances McDormand, a record producer, is a footloose, free talking, free thinking and free loving, pot smoking, product of the seventies. Jane has a tendency treat her clients (band members) like family, by mothering them and occasionally consorting with a band member, which doesn't sit well with Sam.
Alex, Played by Kate Beckinsale, is Sam's Fiancee. She is a lovely and exceptionally smart girl, head of her class at Harvard, a product of a rich conservative household, totally sheltered from any form of depravity and fully dedicated to her studies, that is until she gets to LA.
Ian, played by Alessandro Nivola, is the bands leader and singer and has recently taken up with Jane. Ian is sixteen years Janes junior but he genuinely seems attached to Jane and out for a good time, wherever that may be.
The plot seems to be that an attractive engaged couple, Sam and Alex, move to a new area and their love gets tested by unforseen and compelling circumstances. A subplot is the acrimonious relationship between Sam and Jane, Son and mother, can it, will it be resolved.
Things get a little strained for Sam and Alex after they get there. Sam is constantly embarrassed and apologizing for his mother, while Alex is fascinated by such a freewheeling lifestyle.
Then things get a more complicated as Sam gets pursued by a very attractive second year intern, Natascha McElhone, at his work and Alex, unable to concentrate on her dissertation to complete her own doctorate, seemingly gets drawn in to this new, strange, seamy atmosphere along with it's attendant, wanton behavior.

Conclusion
Mother and Son, Jane and Sam, are polar opposites. He rejects everything she is and tries to go in the opposite direction and she is a mother hen to all but her own son, which in turn probably made Sam jealous. This love / hate relationship comes to a boil. In the meantime, Alex is almost Euphoric over her newfound freedom. Freedom to indulge a new lifestyle, to experience new and exciting things.

This often indicates that only the so-called intellectual elite might pretend to enjoy the end result.  Alas, my initial cynicism was right on target.  This movie is only slightly more exciting than watching grass growing.  Christian Bale portrays a thirty something psychiatrist who may have some incestuous hang-ups over his mother, Jane (Frances McDormand).  Remember Mommy Dearest? Jane is weird to say the least.  She is the stereotypical Californian hippie weirdo (If I lived in that particular state---I might be inclined to sue the makers of Laurel Canyon for slander).  And why did  Kate Beckinsale agree to appear in this film?  Is her career in decline?  Could she be desperate to find an appropriate role?  Beckinsale is wasting her time as a woman who is unsure of her sexual inclinations.  She is provided dialogue that is borderline ridiculous.
We observe the characters dealing with their inner Freudian demons.  They could keep a dozen psychoanalysts employed for many years into the future.  Should we care?  Nope, these affluent folks are too much into navel gazing.  They have far too much time and money on their hands.  Regular adults usually have real problems to be concerned about.  Cant I say anything positive concerning Laurel Canyon?  Oh well, Frances McDormands performance is riveting and she is the only reason why I can even give this film three stars.  This woman is a fantastic actress and should be more careful in the future.  She might also wish to fire her agent.",1066348800,,1606,5.026615969581749
1885174,3,B00009MEKL,"LAUREL CANYON, a drama, is more than just a little reminiscent of 1994's SIRENS, a comedy. In the latter, Hugh Grant plays a newly-minted Anglican cleric of the Victorain era posted to Australia, where his bishop assigns him the task of prevailing upon a celebrated local artist (Sam Neill) to elevate his canvasses out of the gutter by leaving out the bare-naked ladies. Arriving at the artist's tropical residence, the minister finds the sultry lushness of the surroundings exceeded only by that of several nude models, one of whom is Elle Macpherson. While the cleric valiantly keeps a stiff upper lip in the face of so much nubile flesh, his sexually repressed wife (Tara Fitzgerald) is soon seduced by the sensual atmosphere that pervades the place and is presided over by the Neill character, a sort of benignly detached Hugh Hefner type.
In this film, Dr. Sam, M.D. (Christian Bale) and his fiancee, Dr. Alex, M.D. (Kate Beckinsale), both graduates of Harvard Med, travel to Los Angeles to temporarily take up abode in the vacant residence of the former's mother, Jane (Frances McDormand), while Alex does a First Year Resident gig in the psychiatric unit of a local hospital and Alex finishes up her Ph. D. dissertation on the genomics of fruit flies. However, upon arriving at the home in LAUREL CANYON, the two find the place still occupied. Jane, a record producer and aging Flower Child, is using the location  to put together a new disc with a British rock band. Uptight Sam, who describes his Mom as dysfunctional, is not overly surprised to find her presiding over an environment of marijuana, casual sex, and rock 'n' roll - the traditional California dangers (according to traditional mothers everywhere) to virtue and clean living. But there's nothing Sam can do on a daily basis but go off to do his shrink stuff, during which he becomes attracted to Second Year Resident Dr. Sara (Natascha McElhone), while leaving Alex at home to cope with the corrosive hedonism of surroundings so unlike those of her hoity-toity Eastern upbringing.
For me, the only reason to see LAUREL CANYON is the talented Frances McDormand, who proves that she, as an older actress, can be awfully sexy. Of the female roles in the film, world weary and wise Jane is the only one who promises a Good Time not subject to guilty post-coital introspection. Since none of the other characters captured my interest or sympathy, the quality of the acting involved in their portrayal is irrelevant. Ian (Alessandro Nivola), the leader of the rock group, is just obnoxious as Jane's 20-year-younger, Bad Boy lover. Sara is vapid as the seductress of the one she should be professionally mentoring, and who should know better. The admittedly lovely Alex is like a deer caught in the headlights of temptation, and Sam is too neurotic to be an appealing persona. And the very last scene of the film left my wife and I saying ""Huh?"".
If you have a choice between LAUREL CANYON and SIRENS, choose the latter. As an adult fairy tale and/or morality play, it's much more fun and entertaining.",1065916800,5,3070,4.858778625954199

Maybe it's the obvious lack of attention to details (Sarah, the supposed 'Israeli' has an obviously Russian accent, grammar and sentence structure). Maybe it's a combination of both - the director decided to focus on the wrong detail to 'thicken' the plot and make Kate Beckinsale's charactetr's dillema easier to identify with, but nudity & sex are too obvious and predictable to add any interest to this already boring film.",1065916800,7,734,4.78740157480315

1885178,4,B00009MEKL,"Ever since I took a screenwriting class a decade ago, I have been keenly aware of opening scenes. Though the first ten minutes of a film are usually devoted to setting up everything that will follow, the first seconds will tell you quite a bit about the movie you are going to watch. Rent a movie, or go see one in the theater. Even the credits will give you an idea about what you're going to see, and that first camera shot will set the tone for your entire viewing experience in all but the worst-conceived films.
Opening on a sex scene, Laurel Canyon instantly lets you know that what follows will be steamy, and it delivers indeed. This first love scene is also human, and its awkwardness and tenderness opens the space for all the characters here to be genuine.
It's Sam (Christian Bale) and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) who make the keynote nookie. He is an interning psychiatrist, and she is working on a Ph. D. in genetics. His internship will take them to Los Angeles where Alex will continue to work on her dissertation. They plan to tie the knot in summer. We are briefly introduced to Alex's unpleasant parents, upper-crusty snobs played nearly to caricature. I'm not sure why the film even includes their pish-toshing and tactless counsel. Maybe it's to contrast Alex's comfort with her parents against Sam's anxiety and embarrassment around his mom.
The plan is that Sam and Alex will stay in Sam's mom's house because she's planning to be elsewhere. As a very successful record producer, she travels a lot. But as a very successful record producer, she also smokes a lot of loopy-weed, parties constantly, and changes her plans all the time. Yes, Jane (Frances McDormand) has NOT left the house to Sam and Alex. She's there with her latest project, a British pop band, and her latest beaux, it's lead singer, Ian (Alessandro Nivola).
Put Sam, Jane, Alex, and Ian in a house together and internal motives and desires begin to create external friction. And we all know that friction creates heat, smoke, and sometimes fire. Sam proves to be straight-laced, ambitious, and uptight. He wants to get himself and Alex out of the house, but can't apartment hunt and intern at the same time. Alex, meanwhile, starts to lose interest in her dissertation for the fascinating lifestyle of the woman who knows Bowie, B.B. King, and Bruce ""The Boss"" personally. Sam turns house hunting over to Alex, but she turns inaction into fabricated excuses.
Ian, the Puck figure in this Midsummer Night's Dream, tempts Alex with his priapic kindness until she leaves her studies and finds her way into the recording studio, where Jane takes her under her wing and gets Alex to lose some of her inhibitions.
All this inhibition-losing gets Jane, Ian, and Alex into sexual play together that starts at heated-pool temperatures, but heads quickly toward jacuzzi on a path toward whistling tea kettle. At the same time, the chasm between Sam's coldness and Alex's willingness increases. But Sam isn't only driven away by his distaste for his mother's lifestyle. He also meets the extremely hot second-year intern, Sara (A Very Attractive Actress) and windmills on the edge of falling in love with her.
Director Lisa Cholodenko does a nice job keeping things subtle and human. That's her strength. Add to this a great performance by Frances McDormand, who I find magnetic and intriguing, and you get an engaging film overall. Ian the Rocker adds a good comic foil to Sam's tightly wound intern. These characters aren't cutouts, which is nice. We see that Sam's rigidity is often ready to break open.
But like life, Lisa's Cholodenko's portrayal is sloppy sometimes, in the meeting with Alex's parents, for example. They aren't given enough screen time to develop their icky haughtiness properly, so it's rushed into one scene and comes off looking like satire, not realism. Elsewhere, Sam is blatantly unable to put his finger on the lack of mother-love in his childhood as a cause for some of his current behavior. As a viewer, you recognize this aspect of his personality immediately, and since Sam is a training psychiatrist, you'd think he'd have an inkling, but he doesn't.
In spite of these glitches, or maybe because of them, Laurel Canyon really involves a viewer in its characters. You can get wrapped into them because there is depth there; moreover, each character is fundamentally likeable.
It is nice that Laurel Canyon does not tie up all its loose ends to deliver a typically clean, all-happy Hollywood conclusion. What would have been nice, though, would be to have had any kind of conclusion at all. Though I recognize the hipness of leaving some questions unanswered, I'd humbly request that filmmakers consider their last scenes at least as carefully as their opening scenes.",1061769600,4,4776,4.875768757687577
1885179,4,B00009MEKL,"""Laurel Canyon"" may not be a classic film, but it is a most enjoyable evening's entertainment.  Certainly, Frances McDormand showcases her versatility as an actress with this wild record producer Jane who likes to rock & roll!  From her supporting actress Oscar nomination for ""Mississippi Burning"" and her Oscar for Best Actress for ""Fargo,"" McDormand has pushed the envelope with a variety of roles.  Her easy going smile and manner here is utterly charming, despite the fact that much of the movie is spent in self-medication of one kind or another.
The biggest hoot in the movie Alessandro Nivola (""Face/Off,"" ""Jurassic Park 3"") who is from Connecticut, but who manages a British accent with ease.  He has a great number of levels in the film from singing star to lover to motorcyclist, and manages it all with an intoxicating joy.  One of the funniest moments is when his little derriere goes floating by on the inflatable dingy, much to Christian Bale's consternation.
Kate Beckinsale who was so charming in ""Serendipty"" gets to play Alex, the straight-laced doctor who gets caught up in a sexually free drug-tinged lifestyle.  One wonders what exactly makes her change from studying the sex life of fruit flies to kissing her boyfriend's mother.  But whatever her reason, she looks lovely.
Christian Bale is assigned the difficult role of being boring.  The movie starts out with he and Alex making love, and that is about the end of their intimacy.  The film telegraphs that this is a couple that will break up before the end of the movie; and perhaps they do.  While Christian doesn't have quite the variety of emotion as in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" or even ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin,"" he does have one very interesting scene in a car with Sara, an Israeli intern (Solaris, The Truman Show, Ronin), played by British actress Natascha McElhone where they describe how they would like to make love to each other.
Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous and the band Folk Implosion do a nice job of playing Ian's band, musically, with Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren doing the score.  As a music collector, I loved seeing the house with numerous shelves of records and CDs!
The film's ending is a bit murky.  So what happens?  Whatever's up with the ending, this is not a fast paced flick, but one that has some engaging personal relationships.  McDormand & Nivola are worth watching!  Enjoy!",1061769600,3,2391,4.898263027295285
1885180,5,B00009MEKL,"I would like to preface this review by saying that I do not watch movies like this one.  I would buy this movie except where do i put it on my shelf? Between Pulp Fiction and Gladiator? How can i admit to my friends that i liked this movie enough to buy it? anyway here is why i did like it.
No one has ever made a more entertaining casualty free movie.  Well, first things first.  This movie is about an engaged couple that moves from the east coast to California to stay with the guy's mom who works out of her house producing her boyfriends rock album.  I think most peopple watching will expect an immediate culture clash between these hard-working yuppies and the drug abusing musicians but that's not what immediately happens.  Its like Ed Norton says in ""Fight Club"", ""people will do anything to avoid a fight""
The interesting thing about this film is that is juxtaposes the screw-ups with the non screw-ups and as any college kid knows, the life of the screw up is very appealing.  What made this juxtaposition great was the awkwardness.  I've never seen awkwardness so well depicted on the screen, especially in the scene in the car between Christian Bale and Natascha McElhone, which is the first scene in the movie that really made perk up.  Until that scene I was skeptical about the movie.
Then, I ask you have you ever been so mad that you have almost no control of what you say and words just come streaming out of your mouth (many of them swears) and in the end you say about one third of the things you wanted to, but the other things were just casualties of your own emotional turbulence.  Domestically I think many of us have, and there's a scene of that in this movie, and it was one of the most intense scenes I've ever seen.  Christian Bale just erupts.  And many actors would have simply gotten angry, they wouldn't have exposed the deep rooted fear this character has of screwing up.  There is not another actor working today who could've have made this scene more electrifying (perhaps Daniel Day-Lewis) It is this scene that the movie builds toward and works hard to earn, and its success or failure held the film's meaning in the balance.  It did not let me down.  I will say I believe Christian Bale to be one of the finest actors making movies today.",1061510400,7,2279,4.460240963855422
1885181,5,B00009MEKL,"I've always loved Frances McDormand.  She completely gets into every role she plays.  And in this film she's better than ever.  Laurel Canyon is an area of Los Angeles where only the people who have ""made it"" live  She's cast as Jane,  a successful record producer in her mid forties.  She lives her life with constant energy and enthusiasm.  She smokes illegal substances and eats vegetarian.  She looks great too, and is a ""babe"" in every sense of the word.  We soon learn she has a long list of former lovers, both male and female.  But currently she's involved with a young British rocker, played by Allesandro Nivola, and their couplings burn up the screen.
Her son, Sam, on the other hand, played by Christian Bale, is exactly the opposite.  He's just graduated from Harvard Medical School and is engaged to Alex, played by Kate Beckinsale, who is not only a doctor, but also a research scientist.  They're supposed to borrow Jane's home while he completes his residency in a local hospital, but it doesn't work out that way. Jane stays in the house, which is also a recording studio, to finish up a record with the rock band.
At the hospital, Sam meets a fellow doctor, Sara, played by Natascha McElhone and there is immediate electricity between them.  And Alex spends her days in the house where she finds it impossible to concentrate on her dissertation and is welcomed downstairs to hang out with Jane and the band.  Soon she's indulging in Jane's lifestyle. Eventually, she finds herself in a unique romantic scene.
Conflict is inevitable of course, and the film plays out in a predictable way.  And, when I think of it, the storyline is a little silly.  But I loved the fact that the film was about an unconventional lifestyle.  And I was amazed at the intensity of Frances McDormand's performance, which called for a full gamut of emotions.  She made every scene in which she appeared sparkle and all other scenes paled in comparison.
The film was written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko and even though the film is set in the present, there was a clear echo of the 1970s and the forces behind the rock music industry.
Very enjoyable film.  I highly recommend it.",1060473600,60,2177,4.681578947368421
1885182,3,B00009MEKL,"The writers have a great concept story line.  However, it unnecessarily repeats itself numerous times.  This distracts the audience from watching what's really happening rather than revealing the events in a deeper level.  This seemed to have prevented the producer and the director to perform at their fullest.  Otherwise, ""Laurel Canyon"" would have great potential because of its high creativity.  All the actors are great, especially Oscar winner Frances McDormand in her role as a music producer.  Those looking for a great drama are recommended to rent this movie only once.  They can form their own opinion.",1060387200,,613,5.257731958762887
1885183,4,B00009MEKL,"As a rule, I don't post reviews of films I feel ambivalent about, but I liked the director's previous film ""High Art,"" and I want to like this one. There are some similar elements here, an independent woman involved in a creative career (Ally Sheedy's photographer vs. Frances McDormand's record producer), and drawn to each, like moth to flame, is a younger woman with some kind of attachment to a young man. Here the young man is the record producer's son, and the younger woman is his fiance. Meanwhile, the son is being drawn, hot and heavy, to an attractive professional colleague. So there are opportunities here for greater complexity and deeper betrayals.
The setting of the film is Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon, a leafy curving cleft in the Santa Monica Mountains with homes perched high and hidden off the twisting road, where someone with money and a reclusive, free-wheeling lifestyle might very likely build or buy a house with swimming pool, where time (in this case the druggy 1970s) can stand still. And it's an evocative setting for the story that takes place there. (Ironically, we learn in the DVD commentary that the house where the film was shot is actually many miles away in another canyon.)
Finally, the strength of both films lies in the performances of Sheedy and McDormand. The other characters tend to be less well defined, and the moth-to-flame younger woman probably the most ambiguous. And because we learn so little of her interior life, her behavior begins to seem predictable. Like the crowd of hangers-on in ""High Art,"" this film has the members of a band, who pass through the scenes without becoming individuals. Only the lead singer emerges as clearly defined, a snake-in-the-garden figure who teases, tantalizes, and is seldom more than an indulgent boy in a man's body. He's an entertaining foil to the handsome but wooden son.
The narrative of the film becomes pretty much one of who's going to have sex with whom, while curiously, the only sex comes in the first scene, and then only to show us something about the power relationship between the son and his fiancee. (She's in charge.) Making judgments about pop music is easy, McDormand's character says at one point. It draws you in or it doesn't. Like the recording that the band is trying to make in her studio, the film hovers on the edge of that cusp -- drawing you in and sometimes not.
Finally, the film ends in that same limbo, and the director sets up the comic-drama of the last scene so well, you have the choice of just enjoying the limbo. And I did.",1058918400,2,2553,4.739325842696629

Laurel Canyon attempts to explore the relationships of upper middle class young adults and their parents. The script is unworthy of the quality actors. Finally the possibility of being a mature adult who is capable of enjoying life is explored in the most superficial ways.

1885186,3,B00009MEKL,"Laurel Canyon is an engaging, well-acted but ultimately formulaic film that explores some familiar situations and stereotypes (most notably, the by now tiresome contrast between the staid East Coast and hedonistic West Coast). The premise could be the set-up for a play, if not a sitcom -Sam and Alex, both conservative medical students (played by Christian Bale and Kate Beckinsale) are heading to Los Angeles and moving into the house of Sam's bohemian, record producer mother. From the very start, we are hit with clichs. Alex's parents are almost caricatures of uptight Easterners; the father chides Sam for not remaining at Harvard; the mother, only half jokingly, warns them not to become scientologists or vegetarians. Needless to say, the couple experiences culture shock when they arrive on the wild and woolly West Coast. Sam's mother Jane (Frances McDormand, in a typically great performance) has a much younger, musician boyfriend Ian (Alessandro Nivola). Jane and the musicians play music, smoke pot and party all night long while Sam and Alex, at first, try to maintain their serious way of life. Naturally, things do not continue in this mode for long. Alex is gradually seduced (both figuratively and literally) into the household's freer mores. She is fascinated and attracted to both Jane and Ian. Meanwhile Sam, in the inevitable parallel situation, is attracted to a beautiful fellow intern, Sarah. Will the couple remain together in the face of these temptations and challenges? Despite the stereotypes and a degree of predictability, the movie remains interesting most of the time. McDormand, Nivola and the other musicians are very natural and the scenes that show the making of a record and the interaction of Jane with the band members are quite believable. Bale and Beckinsale are, perhaps inevitably, not as interesting. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between them. Also, the emotional scenes between Sam and Jane more than anything else made me wonder how Jane could possibly be Sam's mother; they seem to be from different galaxies. Laurel Canyon is not a bad movie and it has some genuinely good qualities. I thought that it started off weakly (the stereotypes again), became quite good in the middle and then concluded on a too cute and simplistic note.",1058486400,7,2292,5.1310160427807485
1885187,4,B00009MEKL,"We all go through a stage (for some it's months, others a lifetime) where everything mom or dad does just hits that annoyed bone instantly. Maybe dad has a habit of smacking his lips for no apparent reason or mom's got a habit of tossing out constant malaprops. Laurel Canyon focuses part of its energy on that dynamic with a child who is now stodgily adult and still unwilling to accept his mother for the slightly off-kilter, pot smoking bohemian she is. Along the way the character also must reconcile his desires with his fianc's needs.
While Canyon does tread some familiar territory, it does so only as a baseline for providing some interesting characters. Sam, played with scary precision by the nearly infallible Christian Bale, returns to Southern California to finish off his residency and brings along his uppity Ph. D. writing WASP fianc, Alex. They plan to stay at his mother's home in Laurel Canyon. Jane, Sam's mother, is supposed to be at her Malibu home. Unbeknownst to Sam, Jane, feeling guilty gave an ex-lover the Malibu home. So Sam and Alex must share the home with Jane and the rock band for which Jane's producing an album.
As one would expect Jane and her rocker friends begin to change Alex. This isn't unexpected as Kate Beckinsale quickly reveals how lonely and confused about life Alex really is. Her progression in the film is only mildly interesting, though Beckinsale does try her best. Her one standout scene actually comes early in the film when she becomes rather catty with a co-worker of Sam's.
The crux of the story really rests on Sam's shoulders. In the hands of a lesser actor Sam would have been nothing more than a stiff shirt. Some hack like Tom Cruise would speak clearly and move adroitly about as if this tells everything about Sam. Bale takes Sam and makes him a tragic figure without doing anything over the top. Bale's greatest gift is his ability to register his thoughts clearly with just a move of his eyes, a twitch of the brow or a purse of his lips. We read Sam's mind in every interaction. He's not a just a conservative would-be-doctor who hates his mother. That's too simple a gross insult to the character. Little moments such as Sam's parking structure sequence involving a co-worker reveal the inner turmoil of the character in a fashion 99% of actors could never approach. He varies between interested, rejected, offended, excited, guilty and decimated so effortlessly it's like watching one of the few remaining masters of any craft display his wares for the world.
Much will be made of France McDormand's Jane. She's a great actress and really does flip so nicely between roles. Whether she's playing a hyper sports fiend in Lone Star to that [sheriff] in Fargo to her drunken whore in The Man Who Wasn't There McDormand can play any role and make you believe she is that person. Here she's an aging producer holding onto her wild youth by clinging to studly rockers, while also trying desperately to have some semblance of a normal relationship with her dejected, far more mature, confused son. It's in the moments with her lover and with Sam that the character really comes alive.
A quick nod to Alessandro Nivola is needed too. He plays Jane's new love interest, the randy bandleader Ian. Nivola gets to have fun with the role and basically play up a smarmy side he hasn't displayed thus far in his films. Hopefully he'll find himself busier after his nice turn here.
While Canyon doesn't tread new ground, mother-son battles, confused partners, people coming out of their shell, it does give us some strong characters who end up feeling real. Their jobs are irrelevant. It's how they interact and more importantly react that makes Canyon an engaging film. Sam's sudden violent outburst comes with such a rush and ferocity that it's jarring but very logical. Alex's tinkering with new experiences doesn't surprise until she begins to cross a line that's not entirely foreshadowed. It all comes together and makes sense, yet never spells everything out with the annoying clarity of most Hollywood films. There isn't a sense of ""this problem is solved"" so much as all of this led to a climax and now there will be fallout. What will it be? That's up to the viewer to determine.",1058313600,4,4243,4.758480325644505
1885188,2,B00009MEKL,"Maybe one has to indulge in lead character Jane's party favors to enjoy ""Laurel Canyon"", a domestic comedy about a newly graduated physician intern who temporarily moves into his rock and roll mother's home with his girlfriend. As it is, the lusts and loves of the characters inside this Canyon mini-mansion mostly reminded me of a Frankie and Annette beach party movie complete with the foreign exotic beauty who shows up on the beach to steal Frankie's heart. Successful rock and roll producer Jane is all attitude, no characterization, strutting around her recording studio in a muscle T-shirt, smoking joints, and behaving like a poster child for a renewed subscription to 'Rolling Stone' magazine. The rest of the characters buzz around her like equally bland insects to a glaring light. This movie concerns corporate rock and roll and that just isn't cool enough. It also suffers from a sad desire to be ""Absolutely Fabulous"".",1054166400,2,932,5.058441558441558
1885189,3,B00009MEKL,"This movie about a medical student who comes back to Hollywood to his mother's home on Laurel Canyon had a lot of potential.  I really think that the movie seem to be over edited or something because it was missing something.  The two main characters, Sam (christian bale) and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) are fiances and both students from Harvard.  Sam begins his residency in Los Angeles and moves to the supposedly empty house of his record producer mother (Frances McDormant, expecting to find a quiet place where he can work on his residency while his fiance writes her dissertation on the mating habits of flies and looks for a home for them to call their own.  When they arrive they walk in on his mother doing pot with the band she is working with.  And thus the story spirals down a hill of lust and drug use...where Sam fights to keep his lust for a fellow resident in check while fighting to keep his relationship with Alex from falling apart.
The characters of Alex and Sam are obviously not comfortable with each other as evident in the first scene which shows the couple's extremely cringe-worthy awkward attempt at making love...so most of the movie the audience is left wondering why is Sam working so hard to save a mediocre relationship where you actually question if the partners actually love each other. The best part of the whole movie is the end, when the audience is left with the possibility that Sam actually stops ""trying to do the right thing"" and actually goes with his heart.
The whole movie is basically pulled off with the excellent acting by Frances McDormant who pulls the whole movie and makes as good as it.  Without her craft in this picture I would say this film deserves no more than a 1 1/2.",1053043200,5,1726,4.587662337662338
