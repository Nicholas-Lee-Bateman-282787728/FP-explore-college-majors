Madison suffers from multiple personality disorder.  She decides to lock herself in her apartment in an attempt to figure out what is going on in her life.

The acting is spot on, the plot is gripping and the story runs full speed all the way to the end.

4493831,4,B004XC5LM8,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Madison (Sara Roemer, Disturbia) is depressed and suicidal, and something is very wrong with her life. Although she has the help of a doctor (Elisabeth Shue, Leaving Las Vegas), Madison decides to lock herself in her apartment for thirty days to come to terms with her problems. If she can't, she'll kill herself on the thirtieth day.

Waking Madison takes on a difficult and relevant topic, and it's totally understandable that writer/director Katherine Brooks would want to tackle it. It's also totally understandable that she'd want to avoid the formulaic, movie-of-the-week vibe by spicing up the visual style of the film. Brooks has a load of talent behind the camera, and Waking Madison is filled with interesting visuals, creepy shots, and a very nonlinear approach to story and look. Although the film does a fine job showing Brooks' talents, the look of the film is also its downfall. Too much of the film feels exploitative and out to shock. Not shocking in the way that the horrors of war are shocking, but more like horror-movie shocking. It's a delicate job to drive home the scary aspects of dissociation and depression without making the audience feel like it's just being presented for our titillation, which would only cheapen the suffering of those with the disorder.

However, those willing to look past the sometimes-too-stylish moments of Waking Madison are in for a bit of a treat. Sarah Roemer is great as Madison, offering a tough but vulnerable take on a character who could easily have come off as unsympathetic. Elisabeth Shue continues to prove that she's underutilized as Madison's doctor. The doctor in mental patient movies is often a throwaway role, a too-good or too-bad caricature of the medical profession. Shue's Dr. Barnes is both sympathetic but not a pushover; she seems genuinely concerned for Madison and is willing to fight for her health. Some of the film's best scenes are between Shue and Will Patton, who plays Madison's father. I don't want to give away plot details, but the pair share a number of emotional moments that would be a treat to watch even if the rest of the film was a total flop.

Waking Madison gets a solid DVD release. The 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer does an excellent job with the source material, which often includes scenes with lots of filters and other treatment.

4493832,4,B004XC5LM8,"""If your watching this right now it's because you've forgotton why you've locked yourself in your apartment.""  Finally reaching a breaking point, Madison (Roemer) decides the best way to control her multiple personality disorder is to lock herself in her apartment with a video camera to film what she does.  She begins to think back over her life trying to find the cause.  This is the type of movie that you watch not expecting much, and are totally taken off guard by how good it is.  The acting is actually pretty good.  Shue does a great job a playing the psychiatrist to the girls in the psych ward.  This is a very entertaining movie with a killer twist at the end that will make you want to re-watch the movie to see if you can catch the clues.  The way this movie is shot and written actually makes you almost understand what its like to have multiple personalities in the way that it never quite settles in to a comfortable rhythm, which works very well for this type of movie.  Overall, a very surprisingly good movie that is very much worth checking out.  I really enjoyed this movie. I give it a B+

Would I watch again? - I did already actually.
