7933336,4,B000059HBY,"George Cukor has an impressive body of work credited to his name. He worked on such projects as Holiday, Gone With the Wind, The Women, A Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib, A Star is Born, and My Fair Lady. He worked with some of the most famous names in cinema history and earned a reputation as a ""woman's director."" However, his reach was not limited to the female sex, and his style was undeniably universal.

Because Cukor was so tied to his work, there are very little bits about his life outside of the studio in this documentary. The most notable things seem to be his penchant for dinner parties and his friendship with Katharine Hepburn. Friends and co-workers such as Angela Landsbury, Mia Farrow, and Jack Lemmon provide insight into the man and his place in cinema history.

Thankfully, there are extra features on this disk. The bonus interviews are an excellent inclusion because they reveal more about Cukor's personality. Many are obviously not suited for a documentary format, but are entertaining on their own.",1174694400,17,1026,4.857142857142857
7933337,5,B000059HBY,"In a career that spanned four decades, George Cukor directed such influential and immortal films as Dinner At Eight, Camille, The Philadelphia Story, Gaslight, Adam's Rib, Born Yesterday, The Women, A Star is Born (the Garland-Mason version) and My Fair Lady. This revealing documentary, narrated by Jean Simmons, relies on actual Cukor interviews---as well as interviews with his pals and peers, including Claire Bloom, Angela Lansbury, Jack Lennon, Shelley Winters, Mia Farrow and Peter Bogdanovich---and dozens of film clips to present a well-rounded, quite wonderful, portrait at the man who reinvented Hollywood. The DVD contains interview outtakes.",1011830400,15,654,5.752577319587629
