8206937,3,B000SUU1GA,"Whilst this is the goons in its entirety, or as close as possible to it (even the BBC have lost some of the recordings) the sampling rate and source material is very rough in many instances.  It sounds like a cassette recorder (remember them) was placed nearby the radio while someone was preparing their breakfast.  Certainly a compromise.",1354406400,,340,4.844827586206897
8206938,5,B000SUU1GA,"For the price of one of the Goon's ""best of"" audio CDs, this disk delivers a very  comprehensive collection of the Goon's known surviving recordings. This collection looks reasonably complete to me, but I am a fan of the Goons, not an expert. I know from my previous efforts to build up my own collection of their recordings, that only a few of the of the earliest shows remain. There were also a few titles with alternate recordings which may not be represented here in all forms. Some of the early shows only survived as private recordings off the air which fall far short of studio quality. Most of the material is theater of the mind at its best and the clever wordplay still sparkles five decades later (even if the sound quality does not). The writing in a few episodes shows signs of too little time and too much brandy, but it would be unreasonable to expect 90 hours of flawless material.

Each episode is a single MP3 file. While I was surprised by how many of the 40s/50s musical standards written before I was born sounded familiar to me, I frequently found myself wishing the episodes were broken up so I could choose to skip to the end of some songs. That said, if the music were removed entirely, what remained would not be the goon show.

The Python's were heavily influenced by the Goon Show, and subsequent generations have been influenced by the Pythons. John Lennon frequently cited the Goons as one of his formative influences. As a result, some of the Goons material has been rehashed so many times as to feel a bit familiar if not worn out, but it was cutting edge in its day. A lot of this humor hinges on clever wordplay and absurd situations rather than well defined jokes, and you have to get into the right mindset to enjoy it.",1199577600,9,1755,4.478125
