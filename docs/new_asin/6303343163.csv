7845033,5,6303343163,"What a wonderful video!  Anyone familiar with the true philosophy of the Hippie movement can't help falling in love with this performance.  Looking like an Orthodox Christ from a Greek Icon, Cat delivers the fine texture of his inspired songs, made of subtle rhytmic motives on his string guitar and beautiful harmonic lines on the bass part, with a profound conviction and, one could say, with a sincere, prayerfull attitude. There is true poetry in his lyrics and a peaceful, contemplative spirit in the intimate audience. Young ones, erratic consumers of globalized trash, you, the ""Oh very young"" ones of this 21st century: please watch this! This is catharsis; this is true message and communion in popular music; this is true art and the spirit of the sixties and seventies ALIVE AND WELL!  Cat (Yusuf), you really saw the light!",1031097600,4,835,4.95
7845034,4,6303343163,"I bought this video out of curiosity and was very pleasantly surprised. My only complaint was that it was too short in length so it seemed more like a demo tape from a struggling wannabe singer submitted to a record company for consideration. Anyway, Cat Stevens performs some of his hits like ""Father and Son"", ""Wild World"", ""Hard Headed Woman"", etc. maybe six or seven songs in all in an informal acoustic presentation that lasts no more than half hour. It was actually filmed at KCET educational television studio in front of a small audience maybe fifty people tops. The camera pans the audience extensively and they show their appreciation of the mini-concert with looks of childlke wonderment and plain old kickback relaxed appearances. Historically, as this video was shot in the early 70s, we see the style of dress, hairstyles and general appearances of the predominant 20 to 30 year old people in the audience of that era and recognize a passage of time to today, yet realize a sameness that still remains as Cat Stevens fans will always be Cat Stevens fans even when they are baby-boomers ready to retire. Anyway, if you are a Cat Stevens fan, this is probably the only chance one has to view this artist outside of having seen him in concert which I never did...",1030406400,4,1274,4.7174887892376685
7845035,5,6303343163,"One of the few opportunities to see Cat Stevens playing some of his hit songs from ""Tea for the Tillerman"" and ""Teaser & the Firecat"". Acoustic setting, recorded in a radio station studio with a very 70's audience. Just Stevens, Alun Davies + bass player, right after he had hit the charts in the US. Other than the VH1 behind the music, this is the only video I've seen from him. Downside: They missed an opportunity to release a longer video, with some more songs, footage, interviews, etc. but still, if you are a fan: BUY IT!!",1013817600,,530,4.474226804123711
7845036,5,6303343163,"This review is rather biased because I am a huge Cat Stevens fan and there is just not enough of his concert video out there.  If you enjoy Cat Stevens music, then I highly suggest you acquire this video.  It will satiate your appetite to see him sing his songs in person.  The setting of this video is a sound stage with a small group of fans sitting on the floor.  I was fortunate to see his Majikat Tour in Germany in 1976, this will be your chance to see him perform ""Live!""  Enjoy.",995673600,7,486,4.127659574468085
