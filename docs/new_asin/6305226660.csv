7886552,5,6305226660,"Yes - get this video. Excellent research by Lyle Sardie, a JFK researcher doing very fine research on the ground in Texas. It is so sad that Robert Caro and Robert Dallek, 2 prominent LBJ biographers, have their heads up their rectums when it comes to the ugly realities of Dallas on 11/22/63. It shows us what they tyranny of power can do: make white seem black, up seem down, all because a powerful bully says so. Yes, scholarship and academia are corrupted by the mighty.

God bless Lyle Sardie, still active in California, for all the fabulous work he did in exposing the truth about Lyndon Johnson and his role in the JFK assassination.

7886553,1,6305226660,"One of the few redeeming traits of this video is that it has some interesting, historical footage in it.  That sums up its positive characteristics.
  This video does a good job of failing in every conceivable way.  It is not a serious documentary.  It is not entertainment.  And it is not suspenseful, high drama.  Perhaps this ""documentary"" was the senior project of some high school kid desperate to graduate.
  The background music is apparently intended to create suspense in the viewer.  Instead, it sounds like an episode of Survivor.  The reenactments of this video are annoying.  Meaningless and redundant footage abounds.
  The point of this video is to convince people that Lyndon Johnson casually ordered the executions of President Kennedy and various other enemies.  The hearsay testimony of discredited witnesses is the ""evidence"" this video relies on.  The reason this tape fails to convince is that LBJ did not have Kennedy or any other American killed.
  If you're a compassionate person, this video might make you feel sorry for its producers.  For they were apparently delusional enough to believe they had created something memorable and significant.  Instead, this video will hopefully take its place in total obscurity.
  While this video's suspense won't have you on the edge of your seat; it may make you fall asleep in your chair.
  If you're looking for serious information about President Johnson or the Kennedy assassination, avoid this video.  It is a tiresome, disjointed collection of interviews with doubtful witnesses.",1035590400,4,1552,5.211382113821138
