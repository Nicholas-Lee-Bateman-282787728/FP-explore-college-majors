8677086,5,B00NB1A0UA,"Where does a particular martial art come from? How did it develop and why? Is there a genuine rationale beyond these sequences? How can a particular succession of steps and strikes be employed in real-life real-time situations? These are just a few of the questions an astute martial artist asks when pursuing their particular tradition so as to beef up and fortify the value of what they are being trained in. Since 2005 Dr. Yang, renowned author and teacher of Chinese martial arts and Qigong, and Nicholas Yang, award winning martial artist in bare-hand and weapons, have been composing and compiling a four volume DVD series that has been bundled together as the Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu 4-DVD Set. These instructional videos compile 27 hours of presentations, instructions, demonstrations, and rationalizations intended to take a self-motivated trainee from the most basic level to the advanced.

In the Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu 4-DVD Set eleven complete long fist sequences are covered. Before the sequence is taught, Dr. Yang gives a detailed historical background of how the sequences developed, from where, and from whom. There are several conditioning exercises for strength training and speed that are demonstrated and explained. Each specific long fist sequence is then demonstrated in slow speed and regular. After that, the martial applications for the steps, kicks, blocks and strikes are unpacked and played out. And lastly the particular instructor of that DVD spends time giving final words of encouragement, caution, and vision for the future. Dr. Yang is the primary instructor in the first DVD that covers Lian Bu Quan, Gong Li Quan and Tan Tui. Nicholas Yang takes the lead in presenting Yi Lu Mai Fu, Er Lu Mai Fu, Shi Zi Tang, Xiao Hu Yan, San Lu Pao, Taizu Changquan, Si Lu Quan, and Si Len Ben Za.

In all sincerity Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu 4-DVD Set is like having a personal Kung Fu instructor in your home taking you step-by-step through special lessons. This bundle of DVDs is perfect for the highly motivated learner who desires to gain some skill in Kung Fu. And it is an excellent instructional set of DVDs for the seasoned martial artist in another tradition who wants to expand, enrich and intensify their practice of martial arts. I highly, and happily, recommend this DVD set!
