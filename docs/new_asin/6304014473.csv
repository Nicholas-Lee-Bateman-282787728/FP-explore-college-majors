763388,3,6304014473,The big lift is pretty boring but indiscretion of an American wife is pretty good and interesting because of Monty Clift!,1182384000,,121,4.809523809523809
763389,5,6304014473,"This is a gem  of a movie about the courageous Berlin Airlift during 1948-1949 by the [American] Military Air Transport Command...Alfred Newman's uplifting music sets you up immediately and it is heard throughout the film...it has a different twist of characters as a multitude of United States Air Force personnel perform real life roles like professional thespians ; beyond that, the theme, sights and the tenor of the times illuminate among the ghastly ruins of a defeated Nazi Germany...the principle cast: Montgomery Clift-Paul Douglas-Cornell Borchers-Bruni Lobel and O. E. Hasse [the latter 3 are all excellent German performers] all are very convincing in postwar deprivations that cast a very somber tableau of what happens when a country losses a war...in between all this, there is a moral to this picure show...a basic human moral that is reserved for the ending...I'm sure you'll get alot out of ""The Big Lift""...God bless all of our US Air Force who perservered to bring, ""Operation Vittles"" to a glorious conclusion against persistent and negative Russian interference....how can you go wrong for $0.01??.....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF",1175904000,3,1149,5.348066298342541

At approximately one hour and a minute or so the picture disappeared and was replaced with a color pattern such as found when the station checks the color. After I fast forwarded it till the picture continued. At that point I rewound it till I was close the that place where it stopped and found that the defective area wss about a minute long. I asked for and received a second copy and found the same problem. Apparently the problem may be in an entire lot that was purchased. I plan on asking a freind to try on another machine, and if the condition is still there I will return the two copies that I received.",1163030400,4,659,4.28
763391,3,6304014473,"The most interesting aspect of this little-known film is that it is a time capsule of the actual events surrounding the American Post War effort to assist war torn Germans.  Clift delivers a top notch and earnest performance, with Paul Douglas turning in an energetic supporting part.  A corny and overlong soap opera plot interweaves real news footage and utilizes real locations.  Real military personnel appear in the bit parts.  It is Clift's deft work, amid the true-to-life presentations that make this a noteworthy and watchable movie for history buffs.  A special feature would have been nice to further explore this period in US history.",1146614400,8,646,5.114285714285714
763392,4,6304014473,"The 'Big Lift' is about the famous post-war Berlin Airlift. It is photographed quite nicely with dramatic shots of the landing aircraft skimming over apartment houses as they land. Montgomery Clift is terrific as a sensitive American Pilot dealing with life and his love for a beautiful, scheming German woman in post-war devastated Germany. Paul Douglas as a gruff, Technical Sargeant who wants nothing to do with the Germans is excellent. He has a fairly interesting running dialogue with his German girlfriend about ""what this democracy business is all about.""  Cornell Borchers is quite fetching as the object of Clift's attention. Saw this movie on AMC the other morning and I was shocked by how good it was, I had never heard of 'The Big Lift', and I pride myself on knowing a lot about films.-------Besides the fine script and acting, what is riviting about this film is the setting. This film was shot in Germany (mainly Berlin) in 1949. It is really something to see the destruction of this great city from  ground level, it's a interesting film just to watch the background scenery. Much like 'The Third Man' is made a better movie by filming in the real post-war Vienna, this film as well is made much more intesting by its location. Truly an undiscovered gem.",1125360000,12,1271,4.825688073394495
763393,5,6304014473,"Having had a crush on Montgomery Clift since my teens, I have seen every movie he made during his short life.  My favorite is Red River, but The Big Lift has just entered my heart.  Monty is such the romantic.  With his dark hair, thin frame, and piercing eyes he makes you want to hug and protect him.

He is vulnerable in this film to a German woman looking to escape Berlin to be with her lover in St. Louis.  She charms Monty into wanting to marry her and take her to the USA.  In the end, when he discovers her affections are for another, he is crushed, as was I.  You just don't take advantage of Monty that way!  I was glad to see everyone turn their backs on her.

The military footage, plane sequences, and constant reiteration of the difference between Democray and Communism is to be expected as this is a wartime film.  But the real story is about the deception of heart.",1103068800,8,883,4.265060240963855
763394,5,6304014473,"One thing overlooked in other reviews, which I am in agreement with over the quality of this film, is that the military people in this film are actually the people serving in the hosting Airforce Unit in Germany at the time.  When I first saw it on late night television, I noticed the very real radio chatter that went on in the aircraft and most of all Clift's commanding officer, who had such  an un-hollywood demeanor that I wondered where they got this guy and/or who was the genius directing this that created this take on this character.  Then when the credits came, I saw that he was the serving commanding officer of the Airforce outfit: he was just being himself (and his ""performance"" will surprise many who only know the ""cartoon version"" of military people). And he's not the only one: they show all the ""actors"" one at a time in formation at the end (the military folks).  Good stuff (and as a former military man myself, I found it very refreshing to see this sort of non-cartoonish depiction of military characters in this film).
  This film is a great product of it's time, the era which gave us ""Third Man"" and a few other of the great ""Cold War"" Noir films (some day ""Night People"" with Gregory Peck and Buddy Ebsen will come out on Dvd, too!).
You can't go wrong.",1060041600,62,1283,4.484978540772532
763395,4,6304014473,"This classic black and white film is an intriguingly original and often humorous love story about an American pilot who falls in love with an eloquent German woman during the Berlin airlift. The pilot's cynical buddy, who suffered greatly at the hands of the Nazis in WWII, tries to dissuade his friend from falling for this ""Kraut"" but to no avail. The film contains many insightful and thought provoking comments on the nature of WWII, the USA, democracy, the Germans, and love itself. Although not a 5 star flick of the calibre of ""The Third Man"" this film has many similar flickers of genius and a clever twist.

763396,5,6304014473,"I got into Montgomery Clift movies during my teen years, ever since being ""forced"" to sit through ""From Here to Eternity"" at my aunt and uncle's house on Thanksgiving Day (I lost out at the video store  when all of my relatives disagreed with my selection of ""Ghostbusters  2""...pathetic, I know, but I was only 14).  Needless to say I was awed  by ""Eternity"" and over the years have seen just about every film  in which Monty Clift appeared.  Sure, everybody likes ""A Place in the  Sun"" and ""The Heiress"", but most of his movies, in my  opinion, were underrated.  ""I Confess"" (directed by Hitchcock),  ""Wild River"" (directed by Elia Kazan, but unfortunately not yet  on videotape), and ""The Young Lions"" (with Brando) are well worth  seeing.  One of Monty's earliest films, ""The Search"" is also a  gem and quite similar in style and theme to ""The Big Lift"".  The  latter film is part of my video collection and one which I enjoy watching  every year or so (and I'm not saying that just because I'm now in the Air  Force! ).  Monty is at his best in this film and he plays the type of role  at which he was most exceptional: the low-key guy with a heart of gold, the  kind of guy you'd want for a friend, a co-worker, or as a date for your  little sister. :) It pains me to think that Monty's career died out in the  early 1960s and that the actor himself perished in 1966 as a result of  years of substance abuse.  I believe that had he lived, he would have made  a comeback, perhaps on television in a ""Dynasty""-type show (that,  however, is a scary thought).  So, in a nutshell, ""The Big Lift""  is an excellent film, a good choice for film buffs, and an absolute must  for Montgomery Clift fans.  Incidentally, it is much preferrable to view  this movie on videotape rather than on a television network --- I sat  through it once on American Movie Classics and it was a frustrating  experience: the film quality was grainy, very dark, and ""jumpy"".  BUY IT INSTEAD.",952128000,45,1967,4.429775280898877
763397,3,6304014473,"Putting aside the love story at its center, this film provides a timely view of the Berlin Airlift.  Film was shot on location in Germany during or shortly after the Berlin Airlift (June '48-Jul '49).  The film accurately  documents Airlift operations, including the hazards crews faced  (harressment from Soviet fighters, bad weather), and innovations (such as  Precision Approach Radar) employed to make the airlift successful.  Having  lived in Germany, I think the film also presents a revealing and truthful  insight into the human side of the airlift, to include living conditions  and beliefs in post-war Berlin.  The attitudes and philosophies expressed  by the four main characters and their associates are representative of the  era. Overall, this film has good flying scenes and a good human interest  plot.",915926400,29,818,5.346456692913386

763541,3,6304014473,"This film is more of a documentary than a movie.  It is interesting from a historical perspective about the Berlin Airlift and about the aircraft that were used (primarily the Douglas C-54) which is why I was interested.  I discovered it while researching about the aircraft used in another film, ""The High and the Mighty"" starring John Wayne and a real interesting cast of character actors.  In ""The Big Lift"" there are some great views of post-war Berlin but the acting is not very good.  The copyright was never renewed so this film is in the public domain.

763589,5,6304014473,"When war movies with tons of action, are digitally remastered and restored, it is simply something that cannot be missed! I cannot begin to tell you how awesome The Big Lift now looks in HD. Filmed on location, The Big Lift is basically a reenactment of the airlift in 1948 Berlin. This in itself, is super cool as we get a ""birds-eye-view"" into what Berlin looked like at this pivotal moment in history. From their headquarters, a group of American flyers risk their lives to transport supplies by air to the starving Berliners, beyond the Russian blockades. The Big Lift tells the tale of two different GI's one kind and sensitive, the other rough around the edges yet kind hearted down deep. With love, war, struggle, and heroes, it easy to see why The Big Lift is considered one of the great classics of all time.",1429488000,,817,4.602739726027397
763590,4,6304014473,"I first saw this on late night TV and later purchased the DVD to watch the whole movie.  It is very much a product of it's times, set during the immediate post war occupation of Berlin and the Berlin airlift. The background scenes are of occupied Berlin, devastated and war torn.  The population is struggling in the aftermath of defeat and loss. There is no love lost between most of the occupiers and the occupied.

This is blatantly American view of the beginning of the cold war with the Soviets and the responsibilities of an occupying military power in a defeated country.  Albeit as interpreted in a B movie with a Hollywood star, focused on a personal bad girlfriend story.  The Americans extras and most of the other actors other than Montgomery Clift were serving military personal. This lends a certain gritty authenticity that goes along with the background shots of Tempelhof airfield and a flattened Berlin seen from the air. Conspicuously missing in those shots is the not yet constructed Berlin Wall.

The occupied Germans mostly aren't that likable, have a lot to answer for as a people, but are not just a defeated enemy. The ground is shifting. Germany needs to be rebuilt into a better version of itself and as a post war ally against the Soviets.  The film is trying to explain a complex situation through the eyes of a confused pilot and a ground crew buddy in their personal interactions on the ground in Berlin.

Our Berlin airlift hero falls for a duplicitous German woman. Her objective is to use him to emigrate to the United States and eventually rejoin a lover there.  His buddy has a German girlfriend he blatantly disrespects, who is good hearted, but politically and socially unsophisticated. Both women are depicted mostly as caricatures. One's a still a ""bad"" German at heart  and the other is on the path to be a ""good"" German. There are film noir hints that the women's lives have shades of grey and foreign complexity the boys could never understand, but his film isn't their story or from their perspective.

Eventually our hero is saved from making a marriage mistake. He exits a little older and wiser about women with a little post war political enlightenment. The underlying assumptions and attitudes revealed, and it's scenery and context make this a more interesting than it's plot. It says a lot more between the lines than anywhere else. It is worth watching from that perspective just to see the seed times of fifty years of cold war. Also, Montgomery Clift was eye candy in that era, which makes the story more bearable.",1428969600,2,2568,4.761261261261262

And he does a nice, understated job of being an ordinary flier who just wants to bring his German fiancee back to good ol' St. Paul. That romantic subplot has a twist at the end that is sad, but refreshing for a Hollywood film. The real gold here is all the copious footage of the rubble-filled streets of post-war Berlin and the dicy way of life that Berliners lived their lives--a documentary married to a dramatic film. It's the real deal of Berlin c. 1949. Also airplane geeks will enjoy spending time with the fliers of the Berlin airlift, ferrying back and forth in their four-engined Douglas DC-4s (C-54s in military parlance), threading the needle as they fly into Tempelhof.

763668,3,6304014473,"THE BIG LIFT (1950) features Paul Douglas and Monty Clift, plus countless American military personnel and German civilians, many with small speaking parts. It's in part a documentary of the 1948 efforts of America's newly named Air Force to relieve the citizens of West Berlin, who were suffering under a complete blockade put in place by the Soviets, but the film is primarily two personal but fictional stories.

One concerns a Polish-American Master Sergeant (Douglas) who as a POW was badly abused by a concentration camp guard. His hatred of all things German isn't assuaged, even after seeing Berlin in ruins. The other story is of a naiv young Sergeant 1st Class (Clift) who falls in love with a German widow, never realizing that she's playing on his sympathies for her own selfish reasons.

THE BIG LIFT (1950) has been available on home video since the mid-1980s. Most dubs of this post-WWII drama are in unrestored condition.

The images go from bad to worse, and the sound warbles and wobbles.  When I just couldn't stand it anymore, after a period of time, shortly after Mr. Clift gets doused, accidently, with white paint, I just HAD to stop the madness, remove the tape and put it into the deepest, darkest hole I could find.  This movie may not be in the same class as Gone With The Wind, but the tape should have been given a lot more respect and production value than it was given.

With only two well-known professional actors, Montgomery Clift and Paul Douglas in the cast, the film brings to life an event now known only in history books in a brief paragraph. We catch the atmosphere of the early Cold War period, with the wariness of both the Americans and the Russians in their high stakes game for control of Berlin. The stories of the GIs and their romances with the local women, as well as their encounters with other German citizens makes a fascinating story. The images of Berlin in ruins is a graphic reminder of the destruction of war. It's also well worth watching to see a young Monty in one of his very early roles.
Unfortunately the quality of the film is less than perfect. It really deserves a good restoration befitting its importance. Along with ""The Search,"" it belongs in any history buff's collection.",1349827200,,962,4.6982248520710055
763755,5,6304014473,"THE BIG LIFT is a black and white film, using the Berlin airlift as a historical backdrop.  The Berlin airlift, which lasted from June 1948 to May 1949, is not just an excuse for making the film.  It is a major source of tension, drama, and mild excitement.  Much of the film is shot inside C-47 Skytrain airplanes (the military version of the Douglas DC-3).  Much of the film takes place in airports.  Tension and drama are added to the film, because of the desire of one character, the love interest, Cornell Borcher, to escape from Berlin to America.  Tension and drama are also added to the film, because of the strict time-frames and strict regulations, that applied to the plans of the two main characters to get married to each other.  Also, even more (mild) tension and drama are provided by the extensive scenery of bombed out neighborhoods, and extreme poverty, in post-war Berlin.

THE PLOT.  That said, the following is the plot line, or anyway, some of the plot line.  Don't worry, I will not give away the surprise ending.  The surprise ending is a great one, and worthy of the best of the TWILIGHT ZONE episodes from the late 50s or early 60s.  In short, Montgomery Clift is a U.S. air force soldier with the job of helping to airlift supplies to Berlin.  As part of his job, he happens to meet a foxy young German woman (Cornell Borchers).  The woman's daytime ""job"" is to pick up stones and bricks from bombed-out buildings, and to put them in carts for toting away.  She claims that she was married to a German soldier, now dead, and that her father was a university professor.  To make the storyline more interesting, Montgomery Clift's air force buddy is Paul Douglas, who also has a German girlfriend.  As the story continues, we watch the maturing relationship of Mr. Clift and Ms. Borchers, and we also watch the deteriorating relationship of Mr. Douglas and his German girlfriend.  A strong part of this storyline is Mr. Douglas' strident anti-German streak, and the fact that the nature of this strident anti-German streak takes a gradual but dramatic shift or turn.

COMEDY.  The story includes a few episodes of comedy --  very clever comedy.  For example, there is one episode in a train when Russian soldiers are interrogating various passengers for smuggled coffee.  The Russian soldiers can smell the coffee, but they don't know who has it.  During this episode, a shriveled old lady displays her bag of coffee to another passenger, and then quickly hides the bag under her hat.  Then, the Russian soldiers come down the aisle, closer and closer.  Suddenly, one of the passengers, a man, rats on the old lady.  ""She is the one with the coffee,"" exclaims the man.  The Russian soldiers snatch the coffee away from the shrivelled old lady, and then disappear into the next train car.  Then, the man opens up his trenchcoat to reveal about 20 bags of coffee (he is a smuggler too!), and with a broad smile, he donates a couple of his bags to the shrivelled old lady and to one of the other passengers.  Another excellent bit of comedy, is the episode with the German who spies for the Russians.  This episode is at least as good as any of the classic Marx Brothers episodes.  We also find comedy in the opening scene of THE BIG LIFT, where a newsreel of an Atlantic City beauty contest is cut short by an emerging routine military task.  Comedy is also provided by the gentle livingroom ""fight"" between Paul Douglas and his sweetie, when the sweetie tosses a barrage of small household objects at Mr. Douglas, while Mr. Douglas hides behind a door.

BETRAYAL.  Although I will not give away the storyline, this film provides a powerful lesson regarding betrayal.  Accordingly, this film would be excellent for showing in Sunday schools to pre-teens and to teenagers, where the goal is to stimulate discussions about faithfulness, honesty, moral beliefs, betrayal, and particular situations when the best moral decision is to sever a relationship.

SIMILAR FILMS.  The closest film to THE BIG LIFT is the renowned CASABLANCA.  In both films, the main plot concerns the need to escape from war-torn areas of the world during, or shortly after, World War II.  In both films, the film ends with people escaping, by way of a propellor airplane, in the fog.  In both films, we find charasmatic male actors, and a fetching love interest.  I am not sure why THE BIG LIFT is less famous than CASABLANCA.  Perhaps, it is because the Montgomery Clift character is just a young soldier, whereas in CASABLANCA, Humphrey Bogart is the owner of a glitzy casino.

CRITIQUE.  The sound quality of the DVD is fine.  However, the image quality is blurry.  Hopefully, this will be fixed some day, and a new DVD issued.",1343520000,2,4726,4.714285714285714

763758,5,6304014473,"Sure this movie was made over fifty years ago, but when you get it right there's no comparison. Montgomery Clift was dead a couple of years before I was born and I remember my mother telling me how much she loved watching this guy on the screen. I think my first movie I saw him in was his debut role in Red River with John Wayne.

The Big Lift was filmed on location and could not be made today in any authentic comparison. Clift plays the typical GI who falls in love with a German who leaves him to believe she's the love of his life. Only she has a secret that leaves you squirming in your seat and praying that Monty sees the light.

My favorite scene is with his best friend, a fellow sergeant who hates the Germans right down to his core. If he had his way they'd leave Germany to the Russians to enact revenge. This guy see's the German prison guard who tortured him during the war and follows him to exact his own justice. When he can't quite understand his feelings afterwards, one cannot help feel gratified a soul is saved rather than lost.

You'll be surprised how many real military men played roles in this movie. If you are a fan of classics, watch The Big Lift. It'll not only take you back in time, but leave you feeling good and wishing you were part of something as grandiose in our time.

As a former Air Force man, I was thrilled with the aircraft scenes as well as the  ground approach radar scenes!

Even though the movie was a little drawn out, the plot was good, and the acting was top notch.  I thought Paul Douglas was the real star of the movie, not Montgomery Clift, who still did a credible performance.

One little interesting detail at the very end of the movie was that the military lineup showing the men in uniform showed some of the staff wearing Army stripes, and some using Air Force stripes.

The U.S. Air Force (formerly the U.S. Army Air Corps) became a separate branch of the Armed Forces on Sept. 18, 1947.  The Berlin Airlift took place from June 1948 to May 1949.  The Air Force was slow to change from Army chevrons to Air Force chevrons, so there was a time when the fledgling Air Force had a hodgepodge of both  types of stripes.  Some wore Army Air Corps green uniforms while some were issued the newer Air Force blue uniforms.  This movie was made in 1950.  I believe by 1950, most of the Air Force had switched to A.F. blue uniforms with and A.F. chevrons.",1209340800,2,1308,4.449579831932773

But the story is thin; if you are looking for a period piece starring Montgomery Clift, a much better film was Fred Zinnemans ""The Search"".  Clift's best performances came later:  ""A Place in the Sun"", and ""From Here to Eternity"".  Unfortunately, his career as a starring romantic lead was short lived.  By the late 1950s (within about a decade), his film career had suffered and he finished mostly as a character actor.  Check out his brief, but excellent performances in ""Judgment at Nuremberg"", and ""The Misfits"".  I think he was eclipsed by Paul Newman, you see a lot of roles Newman did that could have been done by Clift, if he did not suffer for health reasons.  A healthy Clift would have been perfect for ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", for example.

7859451,1,6304014473,"This is not about the movie itself but about the Amazon video version. It has 11 minutes cut out of it, most of it at the beginning. The Alpha video version is 153 minutes, the Amazon one 142 minutes. The Alpha video one costs under $6 and the print quality is decent . This is an excellent movie about the beginnings of the Cold War in Berlin. I was born in 1948 , the time when this event happened. If you really want to enjoy watching this movie, I would suggest buying the Alpha video version and asking Amazon to get rid of this monstrosity . It is almost as bad as the Night People movie they dare to show on here , which is pan and scan, though the logo says CinemaScope. About time they do it right and stop offering low quality videos.",1473120000,7,744,4.137931034482759

7859453,5,6304014473,"Excellent movie filmed while the rubble in the city was real, not a movie set. This was filmed on location literally close to the time it happened. This was an excellent view into that world at that point in time and the conditions and manner in which residents at that time had to deal with. Not a nail biter but a very realistic look at that point in history not to mention some real ""turns"" that I never saw coming. Well worth the time spent watching, and I tend to watch it at least once a year.",1467244800,,499,4.154639175257732
