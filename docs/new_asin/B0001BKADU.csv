8009673,3,B0001BKADU,"now please take my advice and buy ""I spit on your grave"" by its self, do not  I repeat do not spen your money on this 2 disc set. The other film is "" don't mess with mysister"", and oh man what can I say about it but just boring and nothing ever, ever happens completely boring, oh no something does happen one car explodes and some and a guy gets beat up by 2 other dudes. that is about as exciting as it will get, trust me. I brought the 2 disc set just so i could get i spit on your grave cause I couldn't find it individually by its self.

Im not one to go into 2 page reviews on movies but I spiit on your grave "" is a cult classic may be very offensive to some, as for a good 30 minutes this women is repeatably raped and left for dead, but survives and gets revenge, and in all you actually feel glad she does what she does. Not for the easily offended or weak stomached. A good movie a cult classic for any collection. If you want a overall review of the movie just type in ""I spit on your grave"" and a review im pretty sure will pop up for just the movie.",1110153600,3,1063,3.827272727272727
