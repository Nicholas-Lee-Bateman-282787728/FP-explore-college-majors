5731630,5,B00COVV2FA,It has its moments good and bad.  I really enjoyed it.,1434499200,,54,3.909090909090909
5731631,5,B00COVV2FA,"This is a must have for any Nightwish fan! It was fantastic to see this new side of Tuomas's creativity. I loved being able to recognize all the songs in the movie as soon as they started and they really added a wonderful atmosphere. If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would, but only because of the acting. Some of the acting was just really cheesy and not believable. All in all I know I'm going to be cherishing this movie for a long time to come. I think it would even be a good children's movie for the older kids. It definitely has that fairy tale/ fantasy vibe that children like and I think it would be easier for a child to relate to the main character's young self who takes part in most of the movie. I felt like I connected to the movie as much as I did to the album. I feel like almost anyone can find a character to relate to in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes fairy tale/ fantasy stories and of course anyone who likes Nightwish.",1401840000,2,994,4.128865979381444
5731632,4,B00COVV2FA,"Nightwish's musical ouevre is a brilliant mashup of showtunes, film scores, and heart-thumping metal with a little bit of Disney and darkness.  That also pretty much sums up their first foray into filmmaking.  Imaginaerum is equal parts music video and art film.  The film's strength is the spectacle - think steampunk-meets-Tim Burton - but the story is more than serviceable.  The production is a little bit rough around the edges - the acting is uneven and the soundtrack occasionally overwhelms the dialogue - but the best scenes are nothing short of brilliant.  A must have for any Nightwish fan and worthwhile for anyone who enjoys dark fantasy.

Unrated but probably PG-13 for mild language and occasional graphic violence.  Original audio track is in English - Region-free BluRay will play on any HDTV.",1397260800,2,810,5.090909090909091
5731633,5,B00COVV2FA,"I love Nightwish! I especially love the Imaginaerum cd. Tomas took a huge leap of faith on this album and it's amazing, surreal, ethereal...magical. I wasn't sure what the movie was going to be about. So without reading a summary of a story line, I plunged into Imaginaerum. At first I was not impressed with the screen writing or acting. I felt they could have found a better voice for the snowman and a more confused script for young Tom who finds himself emerged in a dream...or is it? However, I found myself completely enjoying the music, so I didn't care about the story really...until...

SPOILER ALERT!!!
Until the suicide of Tom's father. After that, the story took a beautiful turn into music, symbolism, poetry, love and the chaotic roller coaster of life and it's demons that can haunt us to extreme faults. I was mesmerized to end by this film and consider it brilliant.

I would recommend this movie to any Nightwish fan and anyone who likes fantasy type books and movies and overall loves beautiful and magical experiences.",1397260800,,1038,4.761111111111111
5731634,5,B00COVV2FA,"This movie is enjoyable by all, even for those who did not hear the album; however I think those who heard Imaginaerum will enjoy it more. I loved this movie and it was FILMED IN ENGLISH. So much symbolism, so much about life, Its time for Storytime, hear the tale that will read you real, it will take you away to never never land, though not in the way you expect.",1388793600,2,366,4.169014084507042
5731635,4,B00COVV2FA,"I was very happy to finally get my copy of Nightwish's Imaginaerum movie, and I was not disappointed!  The acting was a little off in some places, but otherwise very good.  My favorite scene was ""Arabesque""...and I'm still amazed that they were able to pull it off so beautifully.  (By far one of the best scenes I have EVER seen in a movie.)

I love the way the music worked with the movie.  I was so happy to see Annette one last time, since she was dismissed from the concert tour only two cities before the concert that I went to.

Worth seeing if you are a fan of Nightwish, and certainly if you can appreciate a good, artistic film.",1375401600,8,638,4.275
5731636,2,B00COVV2FA,In Imaginaerum is everything so cold. The tale about the death bores adults and fears the kids. Children don't go with strange people away. Why Nightwish done this to Quinn Lord???,1373414400,,180,4.838709677419355
5731637,4,B00COVV2FA,"Tom Whitman  (Francis X. McCarthy) is a composer and poet  who has reached the end of his life. He has severe dementia and is hospitalized. His daughter GeM (Marianne Farley) hates him.  The film consists of a plot and subplot concerning his life and their relationship.

Tom lives in an imaginary world, reliving his life through music and heavy symbolism. In his mind he is trying to remember and reach out to his daughter. Meanwhile we get to see the daughter's  life as she rediscovers her father's life and learns who he really is.

The film is artsy. It is filled with symbolism such as toys representing the people he stepped on and takes place in winter, i.e. the end of the life cycle. The winter/white symbolism  is contrasted with the red of life's blood. This film is clearly not for everyone. I'm not even sure it was for me.  I'm still trying to figure it out. It may take another viewing. Great soundtrack.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Just scary clowns and a snowman.",1372982400,16,999,4.598870056497175
5731638,5,B00COVV2FA,"The story is complex, emotionally powerful and convincingly performed. The soundtrack from Nightwish is weaved seamlessly into the story.",1493942400,,137,6.2631578947368425
5731639,5,B00COVV2FA,I enjoyed this movie very much. I think we as Americans need to open ourselves to new things and movies made outside of this country by other movie makers.,1492992000,,155,4.379310344827586

5731644,3,B00COVV2FA,"When I bought this, there weren't many customer reviews, so it was a gamble. A bit obscure, but definitely interesting for the Nightwish fan to watch. Not all the songs from Imaginaerum are played in this movie. WARNING - NOT a kid movie. Very dark themes. What would you expect from a Nightwish project?",1478736000,,304,4.648148148148148

5731651,5,B00COVV2FA,"As huge Nightwish fans we just had to see the movie although to be honest the previews did not look like something we'd enjoy. Much to our pleasant surprise this is, in fact, a very deep and intelligent movie with a story that sucks you in. If this were seen by more people it would be widely recognized as an excellent bit of storytelling.",1466553600,,340,4.328125
5731652,5,B00COVV2FA,"This movie tells the story of an estranged father and daughter, and the dad has to fight off dementia long enough to  make amends with this daughter.

This is a movie, not a collection of Nightwish music videos (although the band does do two music videos in the movie).

The scenes are fantastic and lavish.

The symbolism is amazing, and the music ... well, it is Nightwish.  So, the music is incredible.

This is a very thoughtful movie, and the fans will be talking about it for weeks afterward.

I highly recommend it.",1466208000,,522,4.548387096774194

Buy this DVD and watch it immediately. It's a beautiful tale that everyone should see.",1462406400,,383,4.818181818181818
5731655,5,B00COVV2FA,A musicians life of tragedy and alienation from reality due to memory loss. A daughter who feels rejection.  His fantasy journey to find those memories and break back into reality before his life ends.  A really good storyline and Nightwish music.  I think it is best for adults ( and only for children 16 or older).,1461715200,,316,4.607142857142857

5731659,5,B00COVV2FA,"Just got done watching for the first time. Wow. Unbelievable. Stellar music, but it's Nightwish, so that's to be expected. What really makes it wonderful is how thought provoking and touching the story is. The imagery combined with the music makes this one to remember.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, although I will say it was a bit of an odd one.  The imagery was interesting and while the actors used weren't the best in the business, I think having a group of big name actors would have distracted from the story line.",1454457600,,446,4.162790697674419

If you like Nightwish this will make you want the soundtrack on your next order. If you are not a Nightwish fan but like dark imagery or just something different, then this is a great choice.",1435708800,4,361,4.323529411764706
5731677,4,B00COVV2FA,"Finally, 4 years after the release of the musical version of Imaginaerum, the much anticipated theatrical version (originally completed in 2012) is now available on BD/DVD in North America. Lauded as a triumph in both film making and storytelling, those of us who have been patiently waiting for Holopainen's film debut can now experience this first hand in all its glory. First off, this is a full length film (85 minutes) with musical accompaniment so those expecting a collection of videos to the music will be disappointed. Second, with a limited budget, expectations for a huge cinematic experience with a deep cast of characters and lots of character development should be set aside. Despite the limitations, it's fair to say that while not trendsetting, the film is a definite success.

The Movie
Since the story synopsis is present on the back cover of the release and also published in multiple other places I am not going to say much here other than this is a fantasy/dream-time sequence so much is left to the interpretation of the viewer, and although there is much to explore here, the basic story can be appreciated/understood with one or two viewings. And while the dream/fantasy milieu provides the backdrop for the story, this is essentially a story dealing with human emotions - anger, guilt, regret, love, etc. - and so this film succeeds on the human level as well. The main cast is limited to 2 child actors (young Gem and young Tom), the Snowman/Tom's father, old Tom, old Gem and then Holopainen himself as a middle-aged Tom. And while there are no big Hollywood names here, each of the ""players"" turn in a convincing performance. The full band makes an appearance in two scenes (""Slow, Love, Slow"" and ""Scaretale"") and so for fans of Anette Olzon this will be very satisfying as she has an important role. In terms of cinematography, the Tim Burton style is well-represented here, and while not cartoonish, most of this was done with the actors in front of a green screen with heavy CGI added later. Still, given the budget restraints, it's very credible. Good editing keeps this feature flowing well from start to finish. One of the biggest challenges was apparently in culling all of the ideas from the Imaginaerum  music sessions into one cohesive story. In doing so some of the music would have to be rearranged to fit the more restrictive movie format and some ideas had to be left out altogether. This is perhaps one of the most disappointing aspects here but unavoidable really. Still, I think given what had to be accomplished with budget and time restraints, Stobe and Tuomos succeeded. And while there are some great musical moments that didn't fit the movie score, much of the best material from the Imaginaerum release makes an appearance here.

The Documentary
The BD and DVD both include a full film documentary (46 minutes) plus 10 short trailers (all with the same introduction) featuring different aspects of the film making process for those with less patience. The documentary - as would be expected - is quite detailed and features equal input from all participants, including the actors, director/producer and of course the band. While Tuomos does most of the talking for the band, fans of Anette (who didn't get to see her at all on the Showtime/Storytime DVD) will be excited to hear her input. It's clear from the documentary that the input from the band was significant despite the fact that besides Tuomos, the other band members only appear in 2 scenes as noted above. Also, I was impressed by the actors that participated in this project - by their professionalism and their commitment to/belief in the story. This BD/DVD set does not have any printed booklet (just the tray inserts for front/back covers) so it is a bit spartan in that regard, and some may be disappointed that a ""movie score"" version of the music wasn't included as a bonus disc.

In summary, fans of the band should definitely enjoy this movie because it is very true to the nature and character of both Holopainen himself as an artist/musician and also to the Nightwish vision for cinematic art. I am sure Tuomos has already started working on his next film and with that I'm sure we can expect greater things. For now this is a very satisfying first effort and something fans can enjoy for years to come.",1434758400,18,4328,4.813172043010753
