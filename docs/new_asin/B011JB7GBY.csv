8724382,4,B011JB7GBY,"Not very memorable, but a slick and occasionally involving story about a reporter (Stanwyck) who starts the film gathering info on a casino for her story and soon becomes a compulsive gambler driven to rack and near ruin. Stanwyck is fine and Stephen McNally is smoothly effective as the casino manager.",1507507200,,303,4.96078431372549
8724383,3,B011JB7GBY,"Its a Beautiful Interpretation of SHOW BOAT, not only does it star the Magnificent Soprano
Kathryn Grayson, it includes the Orchestral Background Music for the films most Dramatic
Moments-A Great Bonus. The only problem with this recording, Its not Remastered, it has slight
fuzzy sound to it.

8724384,4,B011JB7GBY,This movie is surprisingly compelling. Stanwycke's performance is par excellence (as usual).,1491868800,,92,6.75
8724385,4,B011JB7GBY,Okay,1491782400,,4,4.0
8724386,3,B011JB7GBY,Watch for a young Tony Curtis in a bit as a hotel bellboy towards the end of the film.  Also interesting for an early glimpse of Las Vegas before it became an entertainment capitol.  Barbara Stanwyck is always interesting but here she's on a routine road to ruin.  Unusual for its time to see Barbara getting roughed up a bit.,1487203200,,326,4.4
8724387,3,B011JB7GBY,Pretty dull stuff. Worth a watch I guess.,1481241600,,41,4.25
8724388,5,B011JB7GBY,I had never seen this one before. I do not know how I missed it. I did like the story. Barbara is such a good actress. She took a so so story and made a masterpiece out of it. Good picture and sound.,1458518400,5,199,3.6511627906976742
8724389,5,B011JB7GBY,Gripping performance by Stanwyck! A nice woman's decent into a sleazy gambling underworld when she becomes addicted is chilling. Noir drama of the underbelly of the gambling world!,1448323200,4,180,5.464285714285714
