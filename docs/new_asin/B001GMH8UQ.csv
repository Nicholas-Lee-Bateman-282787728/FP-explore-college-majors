3615990,5,B001GMH8UQ,"DVD releases[edit]

CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released the first two seasons of My Three Sons on DVD in Region 1.[8][9]

All releases have been reworked to eliminate licensed musical and sound assets. Although the original theme tune has been left unaltered, the background musical score for most episodes (which were originally stock music from the Capitol Records library) was replaced with more modern, synthesized music. The Capitol licensing agreement only covered broadcast rights, not home video rights, and clearing the music for DVD with the individual composers as necessary was deemed cost-prohibitive.[10] This situation may change if the later seasons eventually come to DVD as Frank DeVol was the in-house composer and the later episodes should not need to be rescored",1432166400,,795,5.455284552845528
3615991,5,B001GMH8UQ,"The black and white MY THREE SONS were the best ones. Unfortunately because they were in black and white they were not re-runned as much as the color ones. If you've only seen the color ones  you have no idea how fresh, funny and creative the show was in those 5 seasons. This DVD set is all the proof that is needed The cast also helps..William Frawley was much better than his later replacement and Tim Considine was sorely missed after he left the show. While Don Grady remained in the color episodes his parts eventually got reduced and he didn't get to show his genuine flair for comedy that we get to see in the 5 black and white years. Later the show lost what made it unique. Here you have a truly different kind of family and there is humor and charm tn these episodes that is very appealing. So far only the first 2 seasons are available, but that's better than nothing and the video quality is excellent. If you haven't seen these, you have not really seen MY THREE SONS",1430006400,5,981,4.331521739130435

3615996,1,B001GMH8UQ,CBS has changed the intro music and edited the series. Why? When you buy a piece of the past it ruins what you hoped for -I would like to know the reasoning for this.,1421366400,2,166,3.911764705882353
3615997,1,B001GMH8UQ,"I agree with most people on this site. I was so excited to finally get to watch this show again = all my cases came cracked inside, they were purchased new not used. I didn't realize that the intro music being changed would have a big affect  on me but it did. the music sounds so cheesy and it abruptly stops after a couple of seconds. It is really a shame that all of these are so edited. I don't understand why they would do this to this series. I understand why they are breaking them in to two different volumes-for the love of money, but why change the format. I just don't get it . I love the shows but I am out some 60  odd dollars. I should of listened to the others but I wanted to see the shows so bad.",1421366400,3,713,3.9444444444444446

3616016,5,B001GMH8UQ,"This series is still funny.  It reminds of a different time in US history where neighbors knew each other and family spent time together.  This was not a typical family, it was all men.  Grandfather, father and three boys and the writing was great in portraying how difficult but yet functional a melded family could be",1382832000,,319,4.660714285714286

I remember watching this when I was about 11-12 years old and it is still as funny now. The DVD's are of great quality and the comedy is so well written and funny. Truly a timeless classic.

A couple weeks after it arrived I visited and decided to open it to make sure it was in good condition. However, upon opening the completely undamaged box I found the contents inside were damaged to the point I could not give it as a gift.

3616037,2,B001GMH8UQ,"I appreciate the reviews offered here, especially the cautions about Paramount's tampering. I was ready to purchase. But, I have changed my mind. See, several years ago, I was lured to purchase a COMPLETE set of MY THREE SONS. The ENTIRE series from the Bub years through the California move and the finale. That's right. Some 50 disks or so. But once I got them, I was unhappy to discover they were pirated. (don't quit reading yet.)That's right. Someone had/has recorded them from TVLAND airings, put them on DVD's and sold them. The price was pretty good. Low $100's for the entire bundle. But, again, since they were pirated, I felt swindled. Then, I came across these seemingly authentic DVDs and was excited. But alas, I learned that they, like some other PARAMOUNT vintage sets, have been tampered with. (Gomer Pyle is another example: season ONE is okay, but the subsequent seasons, which OMIT things like Gomer and Carol Burnette singing scenes, have been tampered with.) So, I'm now GLAD I bought the bootleg, pirated disks and will not clutter my DVD cabinets with these diluted ones.",1325808000,4,1095,4.86096256684492
3616038,1,B001GMH8UQ,"I have not bought nor will I buy this DVD only because of the bad reviews, which point out the bad remix of sound, not playing the original theme and by slicing and dicing the series instead of one volume. I'll watch this series via Netflex and save my funds for better value DVDs.",1308441600,2,281,4.222222222222222
3616069,5,B001GMH8UQ,"You will not be disappointed. You'll love all of the characters along with the advertising for Chevrolet products at the closing. Bub, played by William Frawley (I Love Lucy fame) is the best!",1290038400,,192,4.848484848484849
3616070,1,B001GMH8UQ,"I was all set to start purchasing the 12 seasons of this show until I read these reviews. I want the original music and the original unedited shows. How can anyone improve on that? I don't understand WHY the studio would spend time mucking it up like they obviously have. Did they also edit out any mention of God, church or the flag? There is a reason this show lasted 12 seasons and people still want to purchase it. Don't mess with something that worked! Also, this is the first time I have seen an attempt to rip off customers for a 'half-season'??? What is that??!! Anyone who remembers this show is old enough to see when we are being abused as a customer. Regretably, I have no intent to purchase this show until it is re-released in the original format, no editing, no 1/2 seasons!",1276473600,10,789,4.410958904109589
3616071,5,B001GMH8UQ,"Having purchased the complete season 1 in Sydney Australia, I am completely satisfied with it.
The transfer to DVD is wonderful and the music is original,with the voiceover within it,
Of couse being Australia it is region 4, so other countries need a multi region player.
There are 6 discs, well packaged, total running time 888 minutes black and white.
Released through "" Beyond home entertainment"", via CBS DVD.
(...)
I am just lucky I guess learning through other peoples experiences.
It makes a pleasant change watching an old series in such pristine condition, so I purchased
another copy of season 1 to use as a gift.",1268697600,6,623,4.831775700934579
3616072,5,B001GMH8UQ,I grew up with My Three Son's and the first season is the best. The quality of the product is outstanding and I highly recommend to all of the My Three Son's fans!! I'm looking forward to purchasing Season 2!!,1265068800,2,209,4.25
3616073,5,B001GMH8UQ,"My Three Sons, was one of many 60s family sitcoms. It revolved around suburban patriarch, Steve Douglas, and his three sons. Steve was a widower, trying to do his best to raise his sons without the help of a spouse. The sons did have their gruff but lovable Uncle Charlie, around to clean, cook, and give them his sage guidance.

It was fun to see the three boys, always get into one misadventure after another. Dad Steve, was always patient with his son's misgivings. Steve was the kind of father that most kids would love to have. He was at least as credible a father-figure as Ward Cleaver was, on Leave It To Beaver.

I'll always fondly remember this heartwarming show. It's not in syndication anymore, but you can watch it on DVD now. It's among the best of the 60s family sitcoms.",1261958400,4,786,4.489510489510489
3616074,1,B001GMH8UQ,I won't buy it either - fans need to stand up to CBS.  I love this show and would have bought the entire collection (all 12 seasons) in a minute if it was faithful to the music and contained episodes in their entirety.  Isn't the opportunity to watch episodes in their entirety and commercial-free supposed to be one of the highlights of owning the dvd's (and justification for the expense)?  Why do media executives think fans will by just anything?,1260489600,14,450,4.6
3616075,1,B001GMH8UQ,"I would like to state for the record, that I love this show and have been waiting for it's release to DVD for a very long time. The news of it's release made me very happy until I watched a few of the episodes.

The first thing I want to point out is you can find both volumes cheaper than they are listed here together! This 1/2 season set practice (which is an insult to fans) has got to stop! I mean really the studio's should be tickled pink that there is a buying audience for these old classics to begin with. Breaking the seasons into two or more volumes is a slap in the face!

To make matters worse the music has been changed and the episodes are edited! The music used for this release is so bad, it's completely un-watchable for anyone who remembers the original! What's the point of trying to preserve these shows if your not going to do it right!? The fan base for these shows aren't getting any younger and if the studio heads who put this junk together expect fans to be happy, they are sadly mistaken.

I love the show, but I have to say do not buy this sub-par garbage and send a message to these greedy slackers that we will not accept anything less than well transferred shows presented un-edited and with all original content intact!",1259712000,39,1253,4.3008474576271185
3616076,1,B001GMH8UQ,"I just hope that the first season vol. 2 of My Three Sons just goes in the tanks for these reasons.

1. Music has been changed.  2. Half season releases.  3. The price of each half season being what a whole season should cost.
4. The cheap packaging in a standard case instead of slim cases in a cover box. (This one is the least of the problems.)

  I have not bought either of the My Three Sons volumes and its gonna stay that way. I have been reading the other customer reviews for these sets and can't believe that some people would say something like ""We'll it's better to have this than nothing at all"" UGH, UNBELIEVABLE! We'll it's their money that is being thrown away. Also reading about the music being changed, still doesn't make sense to me why that happens. Now it's been 10 months since this volume came out and their is NO SIGN of season 2 yet. So just maybe people might be getting the hint.

  Personally, I want all the seasons of MTS to come out (the right way) because I liked the show and thought Fred MacMurray played one of the best TV Dads. In the later seasons I thought Uncle Charlie was a kick. Also when Rob and Katie had the triplet boys, I still remember all the Douglas men showing up at the hospital claiming to be the father (even a young Ernie).

IT'S A SHAME what has happened to so many of the TV shows released through CBS/PARAMOUNT (GARBAGE) HOME VIDEO. I'm not gonna list any show titles because that could take a while. If us the consumer QUIT BUYING PARAMOUNT PRODUCTS with the junk their doing to it, then maybe they will put it out the RIGHT WAY or not at all, which would also be TOO BAD!",1257206400,29,1632,4.252427184466019

I love how their house is always messy-just like in real life. I ordered both DVD sets. Wish they were a little cheaper and weren't divided into two volumes. Hopefully they won't do that if and when they come out with season two. Also, the 'new' background music was a little too modern for a show from the early 60's. And the DVDs could have had a few extras, like cast commentaries. But the show itself is a gem and I hope more seasons are released soon.",1242172800,5,624,4.2521008403361344

3616092,1,B001GMH8UQ,After seeing the review for this product I have decided not to buy this. I only look for complete series TV shows. It is a shame that the studio jerks in hellewood don't have the common sense to give what the buying public wants.

3616093,1,B001GMH8UQ,"This is and was a great show 50 years ago. And it should be priced at a more reasonable rate like other programe of this era. Putting it in a vol. 1 and vol. 2 isn't going to work for me. The companies that use this Idea to up their profits are only killing their product. Most of these shows I would buy if they only kept the price down. If a product is priced right it will sell and sell alot and profits will be what you want but when greed becomes the high point we all lose so for these companies your cutting your own throat. As well as keeping these gems from the public. To name just a few ""Streets of San Fransco"" ""The Untouchables""and the very good show"" The Fall Guy "" all have this practice which has killed the production of others. This to name a few their are more.

3616094,4,B001GMH8UQ,"The first season of ""My Three Sons"" was incredibly innovative for it's time. Episodes could alternate between breezy sitcom fare and the dramatic. One great example of this inventiveness contained in ""My Three Sons: Season One, Volume Two"" is ""Small Adventure"" which revolves around the family dog, Tramp, bringing home an explosive. We learn that the bomb can easily explode when met with even mild impact. The bomb makes its way around the Douglas house (unknown to all the family members) with one close call after another. Meanwhile, out of town on a business trip, Steve is desperately trying to call home because he has uneasy feelings that his family is in some kind of danger. Wow, this is not your typical 60's sitcom episode!

Okay, I am just as annoyed as the others about the music changes and the double volume seasons BUT I am still extremely happy to have the next 18 episodes of ""My Three Sons"" on DVD. Yes, I am frustrated by CBS for not trying to keep the original scores and for their greed in making us shell out $26+ for a half season. To be honest though I am kind of over all of it. The important thing to me is that they are releasing these early ""My Three Sons"" shows at all.

I don't find the altered music as annoyinig as in the first ""My Three Sons"" release. I am pretty sure too that some episodes retain their original scores as I noticed ""music by"" credits for Jeff Alexander and Pete Rugolo (two early TV composers). I wish they didn't change anything but I'd rather have them like this than not at all.

I really miss these early B&W episodes of  ""My Three Sons"" and there is absolutely no channel in my area that is presently broadcasting them (in fact, the last time I them on TV was on Nick-At-Nite about a decade ago) and I have no hope that they will pop up anytime soon. With few exceptions (maybe ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Honeymooners"" and ""The Twilight Zone"") old B&W TV shows have virtually disappeared from TV. It's amazing to me too considering we now have so many channels to choose from (and there's still nothing on!). All we fans of classic 50's and 60's TV can hope for is a new nostalgia channel to come along and offer great old shows like ""My Three Sons.""

So, in the meantime, I will continue to buy ""My Three Sons"" on DVD even with the alterations. I doubt we'll ever see this series released on DVD again (especially if fans boycott the DVDs because of the alterations) and I know people outraged about the music alterations will rate my review negatively but I'm just being honest.",1234483200,12,2532,4.471861471861472
3616095,1,B001GMH8UQ,Well I was all set to buy these dvd sets of My Three Sons until I realized the original music was gone and replaced- I wanted this show in tack and not edited - espeacilly the music score- that was alot of its charm .

This series is being released with all of the original music intact.  It seems that several reviewers don't remember these shows in their original forms.

3616111,1,B001GMH8UQ,"It is a real shame that a juggernaut like CBS/Paramount is taking advantage of consumers with releases like this. For fans of these old series, it is a no-win situation. If you buy this DVD, you're telling CBS/Paramount that is okay to release a half season of cut episodes minus the original music and charge full price.  However, if you don't buy this DVD, you run the risk of CBS/Paramount not releasing further seasons due to poor sales. Probably the best thing to do is write to CBS/Paramount and let them know that you are interested in the DVD but do not appreciate that they are charging full price for a half season's worth of episodes which have been altered from their original format.
NOTE: This rating does not reflect the quality of the show which would warrant 5 stars. It reflects the horrible decision of CBS/paramount to break up the first season and overcharge the customer.",1227916800,46,893,4.687898089171974
3616112,1,B001GMH8UQ,"Well, let me say first you totally rip us off by not releasing FULL SEASON sets, splitting the shows into usually 2 volumes per season Times are tight man, we just can't afford split seasons anymore at the prices you charge! How come you don't do it to all the shows? It seems Mannix, Hawaii Five- 0, Gomer Pyle get full season sets, yet the Streets of San Francsisco and The Fugitive are split? What's the deal here? Second you rip us off again replacing the original music with, well let's be frank about it - it's JUNK!
My Three Sons had a fairly sophisticated soundtrack for a sitcom, and it played along with the characters, although the music in a sit com is not as imperative as a drama like ""The Fugitive"" which was horribly butchered musically, for the ridiculous amount we are paying for these things why can't we get the original music? AND ... why is this problem prevalent for the most part only to Paramount/CBS DVD products? Obviously there is a problem with your company's legal department - they are either too lazy to do the research to get the needed clearances for the music OR they are too afraid of SOMETHING... In any event whoever is in charge of the music NEEDS TO BE FIRED!!!! They should have been FIRED after the first part of SEASON 2 of the Fugitive was released! What a PR fiasco that was for you Paramount CBS/DVD! I mean come on a cheesy synthesizer? GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER OVER THERE and release titles with music intact, and full season sets --- then it would be a no brainer for those who are interested in your releases - we would just pre order them without wondering what sort of surprise is in store for us this time??!!! With the economy in such bad shape, nobody is going to take their chances anymore buying your products without knowing what they are getting ahead of time. OH, by the way *****(FIVE STARS for the the show's original content, but I am giving MINUS FIVE stars to the music replacement!)",1227398400,122,1945,4.466292134831461

3616114,5,B001GMH8UQ,"I received my DVD's the day they were released. I had no problem paying the price for half a season. I am disgusted with the stuff coming out of Hollywood, so have boycotted going to the movies for the past 5 years. Since I don't have to pay $20 for two of us to go see a movie every few weeks, I can easily justify spending just a little more than that to enjoy My Three Sons anytime I want to.
As for the DVD's - I'm of an age that I remember the later years more than the early ones. So I don't miss the original music, because I don't remember it! And I didn't realize how slapstick the first season was! I know the later ones weren't, but this one definitely is. The quality of the DVD's seem fine, and I watched all the episodes in less than a week. So much better than what's on the tube now days.",1225929600,5,804,3.9691358024691357

3616118,5,B001GMH8UQ,"Well be greatfull that the studios are putting out anything from this time period of golden tv. In those days tv wasn't looked at for future runs or reruns. now that there is an interest and dvd technology more shows are popping up. Its a shame but some times the original elements are lost and yes you have to deal with music changes of something else in order to get the product out at all. Don't you think if all was intact the studios would definetly put it out but somtimes its just not possible to get a clean copy of every segment even from the actual archives. I enjoyed season one volume one very much I was too small to remember any of the William Frawley episodes and truly delighted to see him in something else besides I love Lucy. I am 47 and have finally seen the first half of the season and enjoyed it very much. Yes there lots of people delighted to see it with or without original scores, only the original audience the first time will be annoyed but new generations of fans won't mind. As I said the elements may not exist anymore hence the changes in music etc.one example MPI researched hard to find every episode of ABC gothic soap opera Dark Shadows from 1966 to 1971 unfortunately quite a few of episodes were lost and replaced with black and white video copies of even color episodes. It would be stupid to boycott a show because some of the original color shows are not there, lost by the actual archives. Just be glad the studio did its best to bring you the series as complete as possible. Boycotting a series for these technical differences will just ensure that no future volumes of long running series will come out, after all are you taking your money to your grave, live it little and enjoy whats put out cause there may be none after that in our lifetime. Examples to this day still Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman  and Batman Adam West series may never make it to dvd because of contract and litigation. So be gratefully your favorite has made to dvd at all. MONTHS LATER IT IS July 2010 AND NO CHANGE",1223942400,13,2045,4.36745406824147
