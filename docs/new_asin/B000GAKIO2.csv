8129734,5,B000GAKIO2,This video brought a few tears to some homesick pittsburghers.  Excellent documentary by the masterful Rick Sebak.  Dont miss it,1355443200,,128,5.35
8129735,5,B000GAKIO2,"Rick Sebak continues to delight this Pittsburgh native with his documentaries about our shared hometown.  Sebak allows his subjects to tell their own stories uninterrupted, and by blending those narratives deftly together, conveys both the history and contemporary flavor of Pittsburgh's people and neighborhoods in a fresh and captivating way. I remain amazed that cities the size of New York or Chicago, with their much-ballyhoo'ed ""art cultures"", have yet to produce a hometown video historian who can match Sebak's skill.",1172793600,4,525,5.5625
