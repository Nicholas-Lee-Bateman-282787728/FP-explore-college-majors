1746858,5,B00006FDCQ,"If you love musicals, MGM, and in particular, the magic of Gene Kelly, this DVD is for you!  Highlights his musical numbers and also lends a personal side to Kelly that is seldom seen.  Completes any film library and is a great source of information.",1138665600,5,250,4.533333333333333
1746859,5,B00006FDCQ,"This documentary provides real insight into the man, Gene Kelly, behind the dancing shoes, flashy choreography and ""leading man"" status in countless musicals.  It opens with two men discussing the meaning of life, and one of them refers to Kelly's ""Singin' In the Rain"" sequence as being one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed in the movies.  I think it is safe to say that many of us will agree.........and those of us who don't agree, probably haven't seen the movie yet!  (and they should!)

This film takes a look at Gene, through the eyes of his daughter, his first wife, his co-stars, film critics, and juxtaposes these views with clips of some amazing dance numbers.  There was even rare footage of Gene Kelly, before he became the star he remains to be today, preserved in film and in our hearts and minds.  This was of his footwork in a staged version of the musical, ""Pal Joey.""  This young man, who started out as an Econ major, and then went on to fluorish as an accomplished dancer, and even taught lessons, was brimming with talent from the beginning.  What made Kelly so accessible as a dancer and performer, was his universal, down-to-earth appeal.  He was truly the ""every man.""  This is made reference to on several occasions, as the documentary progressed. Gene made dancing masculine, and something that men should not only feel free to do (like a sport), but also something they should take pride in.

This is definitely a ""must see.""",1123113600,35,1461,4.71259842519685
1746860,5,B00006FDCQ,"I have been a Gene Kelly fan ever since I can remember.  Gene symbolized the era of the great ""American Musicals"" and his legacy continues to influence new generations of dancers and artists.  Gene was ""one of a kind"" an amazingly spirited individual whose zest and drive for perfection produced some of the most ""memorable moments"" on film!

This documentary is a fascinating glimpse into the life of a genius who truly cared about his work and listening to his fellow actors and choreographers talk about their association with Gene is wonderful!  Gene was also very human and this documentary points it out very well!  Seeing all the clips of Gene dancing is a treat and hearing him being interviewed gives quite a bit of insight into what Gene thought about dance and life in general.  This is one of the best film documentaries I have ever seen of a Hollywood celebrity and is a ""must see"" for any fan of Kelly's or for anyone who has ever seen one of his great films!

I think I have practically seen all of Gene Kelly's movies and whenever I'm down and need a little pick me up I'll put one of his movies on and immediately I feel better!  Gene had that effect on people..His bright smile and enthusiasm and the glorious songs that pepper his musicals are all classic reminders of a joyful time!

My hats off to the producers and directors of this wonderful program!  Thank you for bringing us closer to Gene and the people who loved and cared for him!  Gene was a true genius of cinema and his wonderful films will always be a legacy to the legendary artist that he was..God Bless you Gene..",1119484800,5,1599,4.498269896193771
1746861,5,B00006FDCQ,"I enjoyed this documentary more than any book I've read about Gene Kelly, simply because it was visual.  I think it was extremely well done, especially the interviews with his co-stars, first wife, eldest daughter and colleagues.

I really enjoyed watching clips from some of the movies which aren't really as prominent as Singin' in The Rain & An American in Paris, but no less enjoyable.  I'm using it as a basis to widen my DVD collection.",1090886400,6,442,4.714285714285714
1746862,5,B00006FDCQ,"Another top notch documentary from American Masters. This biography of G Kelly is just incredible. An excellent review of his life and films. The big ones, like Singing in the Rain and American in Paris, but also many of the lesser known films.  Will leave you shaking your head on how anyone could dance like this. As pointed out in the film, his dancing appealed to men as well as women. His physical abilities made dancing look both artistic and athletic. He created dance numbers never tried before, and not seen since on the silver screen. In addition to all this, the film quality is  unbelievable.  Nearly every movie clip was restored to better than original condition. The colors and clarity, especially on a high def tv, are so sharp you will not believe these are 50+ year old movie clips.

1747016,5,B00006FDCQ,"Gene Kelly is arguably the greatest and most innovative dancer in American history, with a career spanning the period from the mid-1920s almost until his death in 1996.  During that period he performed as a singer, dancer, actor, choreographer, and director; and is credited with creating the American style of dance and for starring in what is generally considered to be the greatest musical of all time, Singing in the Rain.

Trained by his mother as a child, Kelly teamed with his brother, Fred, on the stage in the 1920s and honed his skills as a dancer and choreographer while working at his Mothers dance studio during the first great depression.  His big break came when he was signed to play in the original Broadway production of Pal Joey.  This led to the motion picture career which made his a household name.

This DVD tells his story primarily through selected dance routines from his more popular films; but also through interviews with his first wife, his children, his dance partners, and friends and associates who knew him.  Its a great story about a great personality, told in words and film.  If you appreciate great dancing, I think youll have to agree: this is the best.",1390348800,2,1192,4.785365853658536

By far, in my personal opinion, he was the best, the other movies I ordered, ""King & I"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", ""The Three Muskateers"", ""George M"" and others were all favorites of ours from a wonderful era of Classic movies. I gave these to my husband for our 50th Wedding Anniversary on March 23, 2012.  He was always trying to record them and running out of space on our tv, and now we know where and when to find others.

The case, while a tad flimsy, displays some nice graphics on the inner flap. In addition, the inner flap also displays a nice little scene index - a luxury that has long since left recent DVD releases.

He came in and gave a wonderful talk about his work and then openned it up for questions.  He answered them all, the silly fawning questions and the more serious questions about dancing, movies, being a movie star, his masterworks everything with charm, erudition and consideration.  It was impressive that a man of his caliber would come to a free to students lecture.
This DVD is definitely a keeper.  I am so glad it was made.  You can own the DVD's, but the commentaries are invaluable.  They not only tell the story of the man, but also an important part of American culture, cinema and dance.  The ""good"" image that America had throughout the world is because of the Gene Kelly movies that really did not need translation.
This DVD adds not only valuable information about Gene Kelly, but it enriches your knowledge and appreciation of Fred Astaire, Judy Garland, Stanley Donen and other luminaries who created these works of art.",1259884800,6,1069,4.648936170212766

1747128,5,B00006FDCQ,"""Gene Kelly Anatomy of a Dancer"" is the DVD edition of an American Masters program narrated by Stanley Tucci.

For those that don't know, Gene Kelly (along with Fred Astaire) was the leading film musical star of the 1940s and 1950's.  He is known for the films ""An American in Paris"" and ""Singing in the Rain"".  In the latter film, Mr. Kelly's single greatest solo performance is dancing to the titled song.

This is a masterfully done retrospective of Mr. Kelly's career as actor, dancer, choreographer and director.  As you probably know, Gene Kelly made enormously popular and classic movie musicals during the 1940s and `50s.  This DVD covers his life and career using interviews with former associates (Cyd Charisse, Adolph Green, Betty Comden, Debbie Reynolds, etc.) family and film critics.

It starts with a brief biography of Gene leading up to his arrival on Broadway.  It is there he meets Betsy Blair his first wife (one of the commentators) and achieves success as the lead in ""Pal Joey"".  (They even show a bootleg film of Kelly's stage performance.) Eventually Hollywood calls where he is mentored in his transition to the by screen by Julie Garland.

One of the things I liked about this program as it discusses the film musical as an art form separate and distinct from a Broadway musical.  Like all other art forms, the medium is significant in how it affects our senses.  Gene dancing with himself or with Jerry the Mouse  requires considerable technical cinematic skill.  The finales from ""American in Paris' and `Singing in the Rain' involving  lighting and instantaneous costume changes impossible to implement on Broadway.

The documentary also discusses the collaboration between Stanley Donen and Gene.  Gene handled things in front of the camera, Stanley behind the camera. The collaboration lasted through Kelly's most productive years.  The intense creative process caused their professional and personal relationship to suffer.  The former Mrs. Kelly's comments are especially insightful.

If you are curious about Gene Kelly and movie musicals, this DVD is essential viewing.",1200355200,,2105,5.153392330383481
1747129,4,B00006FDCQ,"Most people know that Gene Kelly was a gifted dancer. This DVD certainly gives plenty of evidence of that fact.

However, he was more than ""just"" a dancer. As this DVD shows, he was a skilled choreographer and director. He had a great eye for camera shots.

The biography doesn't pull punches or gloss over his faults. I came away with a much deeper admiration for his abilities...and a thankfulness that I never knew him. He took competitiveness to extremes and was intolerant of some groups, such as amateurs; he was also a perfectionist. Granted, he had to push his dance partners to get them ""up to speed"" if they weren't dancers when hired on...but making them keep at it until their feet were bleeding was going beyond the line.

This is an excellent and balanced biography.",1189728000,,780,4.678832116788321

1747133,5,B00006FDCQ,Superb DVD which told me more about this genius than I thought knew.  Gene Kelly is one of our American treasures and the honest portrayal of his life and contributions to dance and film is outstanding. Hope I can meet him in heaven and thank him for making life a better experience for all of us.,1162771200,7,297,4.303571428571429
1747134,5,B00006FDCQ,"Just this week, Time Magazine cited this 2002 documentary as one of seven must-see films for any lover of dance, and I agree this is an extremely well-done feature on an indisputably gifted practitioner, Gene Kelly, by filmmaker Robert Trachtenberg (who did a similarly insightful film on Cary Grant, ""A Class Apart"", two years later). Originally aired as part of PBS's ""American Masters"" series, the film follows Kelly's life and career chronologically with an obvious emphasis on his golden decade between his 1942 film debut co-starring with Judy Garland in ""For Me and My Gal"" to his career peak as star, choreographer and co-director (with protg Stanley Donen) of 1952's ""Singin' in the Rain"".

While his artistry and perfectionism are well-known with the results proving as much, Kelly is also portrayed fairly for his ego-driven decisions, intolerance for others who did not uphold his standards and an almost obsessive need for attention. But his intentions were clear, and his first wife, actress Betsy Blair, who provides the most cogent and insightful comments among the interviewees, shrewdly observes Kelly's desire to democratize dance for the masses. So focused on this idea was Kelly that he even produced a 1958 TV special, ""Dancing: A Man's Game"", excerpts of which are shown in the film showing how dance and professional sports were akin to one another.

The film spotlights memorable moments - his newspaper-tearing dance in ""Summer Stock"", the impressionistic ballet finale from ""An American in Paris"", the roller skating number in ""It's Always Fair Weather"" and of course, his effusive turn in a downpour in ""Singin' in the Rain"". His failures are also documented - an all-dance film, 1956's ""Invitation to the Dance"", held back from release for four years; 1955's ""It's Always Fair Weather"", the cynical flip side to ""On the Town""; his leaden direction of 1969's elephantine disappointment, ""Hello, Dolly!"". Several of Kelly's surviving colleagues are interviewed in brief though telling clips - Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse, Leslie Caron among others.

The inevitable comparisons with his only comparable contemporary, Fred Astaire, are here, but the analysis of their individual styles is thoughtful and respectful to both. For me, Kelly is undeniably brilliant but somewhat aware of it in his onscreen persona, which comes across at times as abrasive and preening. His last years are given just a cursory glance as he was beset with illness, but it would have been nice to see his valedictory turns in 1967's ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" or even the soft shoe he does in 1980's execrable ""Xanadu"". No matter as Trachtenberg has made an exemplary record of a most accomplished career. Actor Stanley Tucci narrates.",1152316800,17,2743,5.201357466063349

1747136,4,B00006FDCQ,"This is a fine look at Gene Kelly. Some of the footage used is miraculous - the duet of Kelly with Astaire is amazing. The reminiscences from a number of people work well, the pace of interview/footage is well crafted. Some of Kelly's career gets glossed without much attention, but for a 90 min. documentary, this is about as good as it gets. The tone of the piece is never cloying, for all the admiration Kelly engenders, and rightfully so. He was an immense artist. Stanley Tucci narrates, and there's ample enough coverage of his private life, especially with his children, to whet your appetite for more. The presentation of his art is first-rate, even as you want more. Gene Kelly's admirers won't be disappointed.",1141862400,69,720,4.768

It is hard to reconcile, however,  that Gene was deeply competitive and
probably not so nice to work with - That realization is
disappointing, because he is such a joy to watch.
