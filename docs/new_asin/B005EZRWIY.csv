8481210,4,B005EZRWIY,He's lovely and  charming. He doesn't push the philosophy at you... it's rather like sitting in a room with him and he's just conversing with you.  The question and answer was a little tedious as he had longish discourses with his translator in Chinese before he could answer. The quality of the film was not too good... but it was done in the 90's I think. I'm looking forward to watching the other talks.,1419638400,,406,4.472972972972973

8481214,4,B005EZRWIY,"This is a lovely video of HH Dalai Lama giving a 1993 public talk in the UK, the topic being ""compassion.""  This older film footage does not have the same crisp clear look of more modern films, but is still pretty good.  Geshe Thupten Jinpa (still in robes) is also on stage as the translator for the talk, but HH speaks mostly in English and as usual does a wonderful job of communicating with the audience.  At the end of the talk, there is a brief period of questions & answers with His Holiness, followed by a beautiful performance of Mongolian folk music by a father and son duo.",1327104000,10,584,4.339449541284404
