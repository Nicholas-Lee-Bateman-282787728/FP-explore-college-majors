Specific problems: (1) extremely amateur video production, no chapters (so you have to watch the entire DVD all the way through every time you want to look at a specific section), weird junk footage, intrusive music; (2) no clear sense of how to instruct - you mostly just get to watch two people do rather extreme x-c ski training without skis; (3) ugly, technically distorted footage used to attack ""other kinds"" of nordic walking - whatever those are. I'm pretty sure this is the worst instructional DVD I've ever seen, on any topic.",1254182400,,707,4.7560975609756095
8121187,3,B000FDK74G,"This may be a good tutorial if you are a skier or skater, but the small walking portion of the DVD at the beginning lacks any verbal description of proper form and technique.  For example, one should push off with the poles and then on the forward motion loosen the grip.  The people doing the walking are using proper form, but there is no explanation of the kinds of subtle movements that are important to getting the best workout.

During the intro portion of the DVD, the narrator takes pains to portray using poles for walking (what I would refer to as nordic pole walking) as inferior to ""Nordic Ski walking"" and calls the former ""newfangled"".

There is also a long interview with a biathlete in the middle of the DVD that doesn't serve any tutorial purpose that I could see.

Be aware this DVD has no chapters, so there is no easy way to skip around.",1194566400,14,857,4.43312101910828
8121188,5,B000FDK74G,"Editorial: The xczone.tv Nordic Ski Walking DVD starts with an introductory lesson to simple Nordic Walking with a lesson by a International Nordic Walking Association instructor. The subsequent chapter progresses with Nordic Ski Walking demonstrations Olympic and Skiers that cover striding and bounding in both classic and skating styles on much steeper terrain and at higher heart rate zones.

""Cross-Country Canada enthusiastically endorses XCZONE.TV as a key resource for beginning and experienced skiers or coaches looking for clear, correct and easily-understood guidance for improving their skiing technique. As the National Ski Team coaches collaborated on the technical narrative, we can confirm that the theory and practice as depicted are carefully aligned with current and evolving doctrine."" -  Executive Director, Cross-Country Canada",1155168000,2,849,6.008264462809917
8121189,5,B000FDK74G,"I really liked the way this DVD demonstrated the real applications and benefits of nordic walking, ski walking, ski striding and ski bounding in a progressive format.",1146873600,,166,5.185185185185185
8121190,5,B000FDK74G,"The DVD is split into two parts: Nordic walking for beginners and traditional ski walking for more serious training.  The program starts by `walking"" a beginner through the new activity.  I found this easy to follow and replicate outdoors.  The format has been well thought out. Even a long time skier will learn new tricks to improve dry-land training in the second section of the disk.",1146614400,7,387,4.833333333333333
8121191,5,B000FDK74G,"I never thought that such a simple concept as walking with ski poles could enhance my cardio and muscular fitness, without risk of injury.  The Nordic Walking DVD by xczone, gave me a clear entry into this new activity with simple progressions, anyone can pick up in minutes. When your health is concerned, this DVD is well worth the price.",1146441600,7,340,4.666666666666667
