8027228,1,B0002EPSY2,Oleg Yankovsky was Russia's greatest actor and was in many Russian classics but this must be his worst. It is slow and draggy and goes nowhere. Cannot recommend in any way.,1340150400,,172,4.580645161290323
8027229,5,B0002EPSY2,"Grief and bewilderment are not emotions that move quickly. This film allows us to follow a husband's emotional and physical demise because of a discovery after his younger wife's death. Finding a half-completed love letter in a book begins a frantic spiral of attempting to find answers and the ""lover"". Uncovering secret after secret only leads to more questions. Obviously the ""why"" can never be answered, and speculation will not satisfy the need to know. Oleg Jankovskij becomes the husband in every sense and nuance of a man in extreme frustration and agonizing emotional distress. We are watching a tragedy unfold.",1284163200,,620,5.148514851485149
