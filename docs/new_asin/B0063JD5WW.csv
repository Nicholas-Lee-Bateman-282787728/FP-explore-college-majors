8492102,5,B0063JD5WW,"bought this for my boyfriend who is a huge deniro fan, but hadn't seen most of these films.  It's a good collection because the movies in here are not as mainstream as most of his others.  Raging Bull and Men of Honor were my favorites",1357776000,4,235,4.2
8492103,3,B0063JD5WW,"It seems to be a pirated version of the movies.  I got it because I like DeNiro, and I especially wanted to see Stanley and Iris again.  Several scenes were ""jumpy"" or seemed to be pasted together from film that might have broken.  I played it on my computer, which might have been part of the problem, however.",1356912000,5,311,4.327586206896552
