Avoid buying any volumes in this set, or anything else from this company (Partners In Motion, Harmony Entertainment, History Television, all Canadian companies) especially if you want to complete a set of all 26 episodes, which is simply not possible.

Vol. 11 doesn't even have the two episodes that are described on the artwork cover, and instead repeat two completely irrelevant episodes from two other volumes.  (I went thru four copies, all defective, before I gave up buying any more copies.)

On top of that, the entire series are DVD-Rs and not quality copies.

The sampling rate of the entire series is very low, so the technical quality of the image is very poor, even for its day.

I tried for over a YEAR to get them to provide a PROPER (Corrected) copy of Vol. 11 to complete my set and they just don't give the least damn about fixing it, so the entire series is big waste of money and time and should be entirely avoided.

A total rip-off!

Stay away from these and anything else from this company by all means.

Not worth the plastic they're made out of!",1488412800,,1106,4.545454545454546
