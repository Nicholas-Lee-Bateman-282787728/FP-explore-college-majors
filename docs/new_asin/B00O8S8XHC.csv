8682614,4,B00O8S8XHC,Interesting adventure tale of a insurance investigator who is interested in a woman he meets that is engaged to a man who just took out a 2 million dollar life insurance policy and then is supposedly washed overboard on a ship in a storm.  Thinking something is up he travels to Africa to follow the girl and prove the man is faking his death for the insurance money.  Entertaining movie.  Dana Andrews does a good job and Jeanne Crain is beautiful as always and also does a good job.  The one distraction is that the sound track music doesn't fit the movie.,1416873600,,558,4.4411764705882355
