2155805,2,B00031TXC2,"The movie concentrated on the acerbic, immature and utterly repulsive relationship between Chopin, George Sand, her son and her daughter.  It would have made more sense to delve a bit into Chopin, his motivations, and the draw between Chopin and his muse.  Snippets of his music were the only saving grace in the film.  I came away without sympathy for any of the characters in the movie, unable to identify with any of them, and disgusted with the lot of them, from Chopin's hatred of chicken thighs to Sands being oblivious to the impact of her affair on her family, to Selange's throwing herself at Chopin and to Maurice's immaturity and hatred of Chopin.  Talk about a dysfunctional family!  And how did Chopin put together his magnificent music and maintain his irrepressible talent throughout all of this?  A very disappointing movie.",1104710400,22,840,4.921985815602837
2155806,3,B00031TXC2,"The music in this film is exquisite, with Chopin's compositions primarily played by Polish virtuoso Janusz Olejniczak, and other musicians in the soundtrack are Emanuel Ax and Yukio Yokoyama (piano), Yo Yo Ma (cello), and Vadim Brodsky and Pamela Frank (violin). The music however, no matter how glorious, didn't keep my interest throughout this rather overlong film. Not only does the film need editing in length, but some of the cuts are peculiar, and don't flow well.

It's an uneven tale of Chopin's relationship with novelist George Sand and her children, and Chopin's destructive self-obsession that turn the family into the ultimate dysfunctional scenario. The scene about the chicken leg versus the breast meat descends into the absurd and humorous, and though I realize there are people as silly and petty as how Chopin is portrayed (and I know little about his history), 134 minutes of this sort of petulance gets very boring.

Piotr Adamczyk plays Chopin with a remarkable physical resemblance, and Danuta Stenka fares the best in the thankless role of George Sand, as she tries to keep the sun revolving around Chopin, while keeping her children from doing something unhelpful, like committing suicide.

Filmed in Warsaw, Paris and Majorca, the cinematography is nice (by Edward Klosinski), with a lot of meadow scenes and wildflower picking.

If this film resembles Chopin's life, then perhaps it is best to just listen to his music. Self-absorption tends to become exceedingly tiresome...and one wants to yell at the screen ""get over it !"".",1104451200,86,1554,5.154761904761905
2155807,5,B00031TXC2,"After so many musical biographies being made to the big screen, a film about Chopin was long over due. Now it finally has arrived. And the waiting was all worthwhile.

Chopin: Desire for Love is an exquisite film about Chopin's life.  Chopin's music is played throughout the film and the director's musical selection for each scene is most appropriate and touching.  The entire cast, all Polish, is great.  Piotr Adamczyk as Chopin is fantastic.  In the second half of the film, his portrayal of a lonely and ailing Chopin just breaks your heart.  The story is very close to history.  I'm a huge fan of Chopin and have read every version of his biography that I could get my hands on.  Many scenes are based on true stories, including some of the dialogues and letters quoted.  Chopin and George Sand's last meeting in the film is almost identical to what actually happened, according to many Chopin's biographies.  The part about Chopin and Solange, George Sand's daughter, is a little further than the truth.  Still, this is the closest version to Chopin's life, compared with Impromptu and A Song to Remember.

The film runs 134 minutes long and you just don't want it to end.  It is made with limited budget, but completely satisfying for its story, music and fine acting.",1104278400,32,1276,4.745454545454545
2155808,5,B00031TXC2,"finally, this DVD is here on Amazon.  simply a great movie.

please buy it or see it, if only to hear the astonishing 57 pieces of Chopin's great piano music, it will leave you breathless.....you will know most of the music by heart.

Chopin: Desire for Love is directed by the famous Oscar nominated Polish director, Jerzy Antczak (best foreign movie- Nights and Days, Noce i Dnie, 1974), currently professor at UCLA.

the music is sublime, played by the famous polish pianist one and only- Janusz Olejniczak, winner of the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Olejniczak also played piano in The Roman Polanski movie, 'the Pianist', playing piano for Szpilman. wasn't he amazing?  just like in the Pianist here you will hear simply the best piano works by Chopin played by a legend.  only here you will hear different works by Chopin....some of it fun, like when we see Chopin playing with his puppy, very cute, :)

if you loved the other Chopin movie, 'Impromptu' with Hugh Grant, you will find this movie equally engaging.

i only wish that the historical events were better presented in the movie. not all people today understand what Europe was like in the early 19th century.  but, the director gives us some credit for our own intelligence and does not bore us with facts but instead creates a movie about Chopin and Sand's 'Desire' for love.

i am so happy that this movie is available here for general distribution along with other movies about great composers such as Mozart or Beethoven. Chopin deserves to be remembered by a great movie. thanks to Jerzy and Barbara Antczak for giving us this masterpiece.",1104192000,17,1631,4.83453237410072

2155829,2,B00031TXC2,"Some of the 5 star reviewers said this move was historically accurate. No. No. No! Did anyone review this movie actually studied Chopin?

In the beginning of the movie, Chopin's father was pushing him out of Poland and Chopin was reluctant to leave. Inaccurate. At the time he was merely touring and in less than a month the November Uprising of 1830 happened. He contemplated going to several places, but eventually settled in Paris. However, he couldn't go there directly due to political reasons (he did not want to have a Russian passport), but with a help of a family friend he found a loophole, which I will explain later.

At around ~12min, there's a scene where the newly arrived (1831) Chopin tried to sell his Etudes to a publisher who tried to play Etude Op. 25 No. 12 in C minor (aka No. 24, the Winterwind). In reality, Op. 25 was written between 1832-1836, and not published until 1837. Also, it was rarely the case that the publisher rejected a composer. More often, it was more about settling payment (Chopin in his private letters wrote about Schelinger's difficulties several times, for example).

Around ~17min, Chopin says he hates Paris and wants to go to America. In reality, he couldn't go directly to Paris for political reasons, and thus a family friend got an approval to go to Paris with the intent ""In transit, from Paris to America"". Chopin often joked in his personal letters that he has been temporarily placed in Paris permanently. Also, Chopin actually loved Paris. He loved what Paris offered -- operas, fine cuisine, and the amazing and wealthy clientele base that allowed him to a lifestyle that he so desired.

At around ~18min, Liszt plays Chopin's Etude Op. 10 No. 12 (Revolutionary). It's a beautiful scene of a salon with a beautiful music. While I couldn't see the brand of the piano, it is clearly played on a modern (20th century) piano-- loud, crisp, with heavy bass overtones (resonances). In contrast, a 1830s Pleyel or Erard (Liszt's favorite) have very different sound characteristics. In general the mid 19th century piano bass has a much clearer, soft, and distinct sound. Much of this is attributed to the single stringing at the time (whereas late 19th century started cross stringing). Also, earlier pianos have very soft felts on the hammers, and the sounds is more gentle than the loud, crisp sound of the modern piano as played on the DVD. You can go to YouTube to check out what a mid 19th century Pleyel and Erard sound like.

At around ~22min, Chopin plays the Nocturne in C# minor at the Salon (written in 1830 for his sister, not published until after his death). I suppose it is plausible that he plays this very private piece to people in the Salon. But then soon after, he plays the Heroic Polonaise in A flat Op. 53. Note that at this point in the movie, he hasn't met Sands. Here's a kicker, Op. 52 was written in 1842! This is very much historically out of place.

At around ~30min, Chopin imitates Liszt. This part is very much accurate, as corroborated by countless personal letters from Chopin and Liszt's friends. But to nit-pick on timeline, the Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody was written in 1847. How does one imitated music that hadn't even been written yet?

At around ~33min, Sand complains that Chopin doesn't want to come to Nohant. In reality, they spent much of the time getting to know each other in Paris first (amongst their common artists and intellectual friends). And in reality, they spent several years alternating Nohant (summer) and Paris. Nohant was a retreat for Chopin, and Paris was a place where he could earn his living as a piano teacher for his wealthy patrons. Many people today don't realize this but almost all of his income was from teaching his wealthy patrons. At 20 francs per lesson, Chopin was charging twice as much a doctor's visit, and he had no shortage of wealthy patrons during the good period.

IMHO there is too much more hanky-panky in the film than reality. Sand complained (in private letters throughout the years) that she sacrificed the joys of sex just to be with Chopin. And obviously, complained about having to take care of him in later years. What the movie should have showed was that Sand was a sex addict and had affairs that would end as soon as she published a book detailing their private lives. Some historians surmised that she had to have many affairs in order to publish, as publication was her main source of income.

I think the other parts in the movie were in the right spirit. Yes, Solange sided with Chopin, Maurice sided with Sand, Clesinger was a drunk with financial problems and Chopin didn't like Clesinger, but Chopin tried to help the couple anyways. The main points were there. But in the end, I'm very shocked at the lack of research done, and considering that it came with high expectations, directly from Poland. Overall, a disappointment.",1428364800,2,4886,4.73207990599295

It adds sooo much to the enjoyment of their music by portraying the life and times of these famous people who so rudely  died before our time.  But their music will go on forever as tribute to the love we all feel for each other.  So often great performers and composers are seen as ""unstable"", ""deranged"" or ""plain crazy"", but are they.  Perhaps we are the odd ones seeking stability and harmony with a moment of calm afforded by the timeless beauty of music.

Though we enjoy the music from these great minds from long ago, we have amazing composers with us today.  I am not sure I am aware of all of the current Masters, but many stand in today's music as did Chopin, Mozart and Bach.  Let's include Willy,Waylon  and Williams in the group of ""modern"" composers; yes, both Hank and John Williams.",1402358400,,847,4.483660130718954

In addition, there is something peculiar going on with the dubbing. Sometimes, most of the time, it seems like the actors are speaking and gave their performances in English, but there are other times it seems more like a traditional European movie dubbed from another language.

  However,if you were a serious student of Chopin and his quite wonderful
music; one would frankly describe it as rubbish!

  I would like to take this oportunity to make two comments:
1. The piano concerto in E Minor is NOT the first concerto that Chopin wrote;
it is,in fact, the second cocerto that he wrote.

  The first concerto he wrote is the F Minor concerto. It was lost in the post for sometime. In that time the second concerto was published.

  Why hasn't this gross inaccuracy been corrected ?

2. Chopin did not die from tuberculosis. He was examined by all the leading
  physicians in Paris who declared that he did not have tuberculosis.

  I refer you to J,A,Kuzemco in Chopin's illnesses. Journal of the Royal
Society of Medicine,Vol. 87,December,1994,pp,769-72,Kuzemko suggests that
the symptoms of both Chopin and his Sister Emelia are more compatible with Alpha 1 Antitrymsin Deficiency;and I agree entirely !

  There are a number of biographies of Chopin. In my opinion,the best is by
Arther Hedley in The Master Musicians series.

  Another rather good one is by Jim Samson;Oxford University Press.",1342828800,5,1202,4.954545454545454
2155852,1,B00031TXC2,"I love Chopin.  In fact, he is one of the few classical composers I enjoy listening to on a regular basis.  That being said, you must realize I sincerely wanted to love this movie as I did Amadeus, Immortal Beloved, and The Red Violin.  The sad truth, however, is that Desire for Love comes across as a C effort by a student in film school; as I had deducted enough points by the halfway point to graciously award such a grade it might possibly be lower by the bitter end.

Here are a few of my reasons for this one star review:

1) The movie is more about George Sand during the period of her affair with Chopin

2) Halfway through the movie there has still been relatively little Chopin music played (about one etude, some runs and part of a march)

3)  There is almost no character development of F. Chopin except we have a vague idea of his ""desire for love'

4) Choppily (a play on the name ""Chopin""?) moving from scene to scene using none of the conventions good filmmakers use to let us know we're going present-to-past or present-to-future.  In one instance, the faces of an audience at an evening concert were literally whited out then brought into focus sitting in a similar drawing room, women now wearing white dresses instead of dark to signify it's a daytime scene presumably in the future where we are now!

When I recover from the minor financial catastrophe of buying this movie trusting that it would be as good as other movies about music and composers, I'll definitely be looking into 1945's A Song to Remember.  Ironically, it's a pet peeve of mine to watch movies about authors, figuring if their work is compelling enough it can be made into a film or play and their life details available on Wikipedia.  Yet, here I've wasted almost an hour watching close up after close up of George Sand parading around in men's clothes or otherwise being masterful.  Did I mention that her pet name for the physically fragile Chopin is little one?  I hit STOP then EJECT on a scene of a shawl-clad, conflicted-looking Sands sans Chopin wandering out into the rain it what must be Mexico. For minutes on end I had been treated to rock climbing, sex (this time with Chopin involved), Sand family drama and rain through the roof though no piano playing for minutes on end except in the soundtrack.

Someone please tell me Desire for Love really isn't as bad as I think it is, that I've dreamed of a C student's work getting packaged and sold to unsuspecting movie fans because I ate pickles too close to bed time or something.  Otherwise, this film is unbelievably bad.  Don't buy it.  Don't watch it.  Don't even touch it.",1325721600,2,2630,4.520084566596195

The acting & production was superb, and this Film portrayal felt much more authentic than the American version ""Impromptu"" with  Hugh Grant (Poor casting for Chopin) which was more theatrical & superficial. The music in Desire For Love was also superb and magnificent. The many scenes from the European salons where Chopin performed were portrayed with great detail and authenticity.  One of the most impressive things in the film was the actor  who played Chopin who was an excellent choice to play the part. A much more passionate and romantic, artistic portrayal of Chopin than Hugh Grant. Desire for Love focuses more on Chopin's relationship with George Sand and their tempestuous romance and how it impacted them both and her two children.  There is also more emotional intensity to this film, which reveals the pathos and struggles of life and love during an era that most Americans don't know about or understand.

Unlike previous films and other biographies, this one is less expansive but somehow unusually personal, leaving one wondering if one actually really knew all that much about the private life of Chopin. The costuming is lovely but the characters are not given as much context as in other biographies.  For those who love Chopin and his music, this film challenges one to look deeper into the man while simultaneously indulging in wonderful performances of his music.

Not having read all the comments by other reviewers, it might be worth noting that what does seem faithful in what the producers did choose to portray is the refinement.

If the film had instead been called ""A Chapter in the Life of George Sand,"" it would also have been fair because there is a tremendous focus on her juggling act between children and lover(s).  If the depictions are historically correct, the film gives us a glimpse of the private persons whose public lives were so much better known.

The film has entertainment value and is visually gorgeous.  The acoustics were a bit more maddening as the music seems much louder than the voices and twiddling with speakers and balance and settings did not help all that much.

I do not regret buying this and will surely watch it again and eventually pass it along to someone else.",1287273600,3,1468,4.7976190476190474

2155857,1,B00031TXC2,"I had high hopes for this movie at the beginning, based on beautiful art direction, costumes, period hair styles, street scenes, etc.  The CD's problematic sound forces constant volume adjustment if you are at all sensitive to sudden blasts of soundtrack music or screaming and shouting.  As usual, the impression is given that George Sand lost her femininity entirely every time she put on a pair of pants and a top hat or lit up a smoke.  She wore what were then exclusively men's clothes (at least in the higher society through which she moved) because they were comfortable and she was cute and attracted attention, not so that she could act like Jimmy Cagney in a ganster movie!  I doubt that she was any less feminine in a suit than Ms. Hepburn or Ms. Loy were in slacks.  Unfortunately, here Sand is depicted as a publicly leering and too-forward female roue, whether in pants or skirts.  The acting is over-the-top melodramatic, the screenplay needs a lot more craft to eliminate the indulgence of noisy, boring, forced family cavorting about the coutryside among Sand, her son and daughter, and Uncle Frederic.  Continuity around the casting and aging of Solange is particularly lacking.  The movie also provokes my usual beef with depictions of George Sand which is that she is is rarely shown as the maxi-capable work horse she was, writing through the night, fueled with coffee and chocolat, to support herself, her children and Chopin, after her day spent running a grand home, managing the staff that was required to keep a houseful of people comfortable by providing food, lodging and entertainment for her artist guests at Nohant.

That said, the depiction of what went wrong between Sand and Chopin, and among them and Sand's understandably messed up children is fairly drawn, i.e., the hexed weather and ruinous housing conditions in the unfortunate excursion to Mallorca, Chopin's illness stifling Sand's and his erotic life, her boomerang-style of overindulgence with total dismissal of her children.  In most biographies of the people involved, it is clear that no one behaved very well as their golden ages passed.  Having enjoyed biographies of Sand and Chopin, Liszt and Marie D'Agoult and their own messed up children, etc., I stuck with this movie based on some sense of loyalty to the subjects, but my husband gave it ""six rotten tomatoes"" ten minutes into it, and left the room!",1280016000,10,2406,4.945409429280397

2155859,3,B00031TXC2,"This movie was not terrible, but it was not unwatchable. I found the interpretations of Chopin's music to be very accurate as well as entertaining. The characters within the film, however, were not all too accurate.  The real Chopin had dark hair and the real Liszt was blonde to light brown in terms of his hair. The character playing CHopin was blonde and the character playing Liszt had brown hair. This was a very slight inaccuracy, but it kinda bugged me when watching the film.
Furthermore, the portrayal of Chopin presented an open character who said what was on his mind and was not shy about shouting out his emotions. Additionally, the Chopin portrayed in the film seemed to be a hedonistic character constantly seeking sexual gratification from Georges Sand when in actuality the situation was vice versa. From what I have read about Chopin, he was incredibly shy and instead of shouting out his emotions he used his music as the outlet for emotional release.  There is a scene where Chopin plays part of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2 in a very animated fashion playing out to the crowd in a charismatic fashion. This did not seem to mirror what I have read about the real Chopin.  The Liszt character, although a minor character in the film, was too much of a wallflower in the film. The real Franz Liszt would have been the center of attention at any appearance and would make his presence clearly known to all in attendance.
I have to admit that the George Sand character was VERY similar to what I have read about the real George Sand. She was rugged yet feminine, and she was the only character in the film who possessed a physical resemblance to the actual person.
Keep in mind that I did not loathe this movie, but I wouldn't encourage it either based on historical accuracy. Instead, I would encourage it as a movie to enjoy for mere entertainment.",1276473600,8,1870,4.66060606060606

The cutting process was obviously a mechanical affair, with little feeling put into it. And because there is also very little atmosphere throughout, I would say this movie has no soul that we can resonate with. The actors are not bad, but they certainly lacked direction, like the movie itself. And occasionally the lips of the actors do not follow the words.

The subtitles are only in Spanish, which helped a little, but the language wasn't always accurate.

There wasn't much story there at all.  Chopin and Sand catch each other's eye in a courtyard, later she sees him play, and sends him a note.  Although she was speaking English, her accent made it impossible to understand her - she was one of the whisperers...except when she was shouting that Chopin drove her crazy with his refusal to answer her questions...anyway, I did not understand the attraction on either's part. They meet and immediately move out to the country, together with her children (they screech - sound DOWN). They get kicked out of one house, I forget why, and find another. Sand's son Maurice skulks around spying all the time, this gets on Chopin's nerves.  Sand wants everybody to get along, but it's like having three kids instead of two...Chopin does not see why her children need any attention from her and he resents them.  Maurice is sick with jealousy of Chopin, and Sand tries to soothe him.  Chopin appears to never have shown any interest in the children...so Sand is running between her children and him and trying to please everyone (for what?)...Chopin is diagnosed with TB, and the doctor tells Sand it is very contagious and to get her kids out of there.  She makes no comment...later daughter tells her suspicions that Chopin is consumptive and they shouldn't be around him...Sand ignores her.  Chopin doesn't start coughing (loudly - sound DOWN)until the very end of the movie.  Chopin and Sand have an argument and he tells her to get out.  End of scene.

Next scene ""Years Later"" we are told....how many years, or what transpired in those years, we are not told.  Chopin and Sand are living together with the kids...daughter Solange has grown and now considers herself in love with Chopin because he is a ""genius.""  Tries to seduce him, accuses Mom of hiring a maid to have sex with him because she no longer wants to...Sand just wants to be ""friends""...huh?  What happened to their great passion?  Chopin's stupid butler is loudly clanging pans together and laughing (sound DOWN) which drives Maurice crazy and I don't blame him...too much noise already in this freaking movie. Maurice says he has the authority to throw Chopin out....maybe this is Maurice's property?  We are not told.  There's lots of running through the field, running down the road (fast forward!) and much screeching with laughter (sound DOWN)for no apparent reason. Also lots of closeups on Chopin's face looking all gooey-eyed, remembering times with his family.

The messed up sound was an extra annoying punishment on top of a completely dull movie.  I cared about no one in this film, and I saw no motivation for Sand to to kowtow to the spoiled, whiny Chopin as she did.

I think the kids are the ones who desired love.",1222041600,14,3082,4.793560606060606

The music is exquisite, of course, but I have several CDs of Chopin music to listen to without the talking. And there are visually beautiful scenes. But in all, it came across as a cheesy soap opera in an aesthetic setting. There was almost no attention on Chopin's creative process, thoughts about music, etc. It was all about the craziness of Sand and her children in relation to him. One thing I found distracting and annoying is that when we first meet Sand's children, there is a little girl and a son who appears to be in his 20s but behaves and is treated like a 12 year old. Then the story jumps to ""years later"" and the daughter (different actress) is a young woman and the son (same actor) looks and acts the same as before. It adds to the obsurdity of the story.

2155873,5,B00031TXC2,"I own most of the major videos celebrating major pianists - from the 1940's Katherine Hepburn portrayal of Clara Schumann to this 2002 Polish production.  There are two that I frequently rewatch (at least my favorite scenes/music) and they are Amadeus and Chopin: Desire for Love.

I lent this Chopin movie to my piano teacher from the Peabody Institute (America's oldest world-class music conservatory), a concert pianist on three continents. She was a major student of Laires who studied under Philip who studied under Mathias who was Chopin's most famous student. She missed the credits then asked me, ""Who played the music for that movie? Those were excellent performances played the way I was taught Chopin wanted them played.""

Most of the piano music is played by a prize winner of the great Warsaw International Chopin Competition and other instruments are played by world class artists including cellist Yo Yo Ma.

There is a lot of Chopin music in the film, sometimes as background music or sometimes as the focus of a scene. There are several interspective moments where two or three minutes of beautiful music play continuously - including a scene where Franz Liszt plays Chopin's ""Revolutionary Etude"".

The Chopin: Desire for Love storyline has weak moments but flows well and is relatively historically accurate (I read Chopin biographies/letters extensively and play Chopin on the piano) and the acting is excellent.

2155875,3,B00031TXC2,"This is one of the two or three movies made that portrays Frederick Chopin - whose music enthralls the senses and whose personality is of easy prey to theatrical play.

The reviews presented here have brought out the most obvious flaws of the movie which I need not discuss further, though I would have to commend the rather admirable acting undertaken by the leading actor and actress.

That Chopin was described as a selfish boor here I must quite agree, and the film certainly reiterates the stereotype of Chopin as a narcissistic, withdrawn, idiosyncratic and insufferable man, in spite of the ethereal qualities of his music. Rather than bridging these seemingly irreconciliable aspects, the film sought to present them ""as they are"".

The quality of the image leaves much to be desired - despite being a rather recent production, the clarity of the image is inferior to say, Impromptu, shot more than 10 years earlier.

Speaking of which I would like to say, Impromptu has a wholesome lot more of entertainment than what the dry satire of Desire for Love, intended or otherwise, could have afford. Impromptu's comical approach, though perhaps historically less accurate is clearly more successful than Desire for Love's quasi-epic and biographical attempt.

The reason for awarding three stars is the rather disjointed sequences and dialogues that do not seem to leave the film with any clear sense of direction, making it appear to be rather  stiff, stifled and lengthy.

The amusing segments that adversely up-ed the viewing pleasure, though in a slightly ""perversed"" manner, had to be the farce-inducing, heated argument over the chicken parts (which may very well be a real issue for heated debate despite its ludicrousness) as well as the older Solange's irritatingly obsessive behavior, somewhat of a miscast for an actress who seems obviously too old for the role and unfortunately does not possess the physical features that endears the audience to her plight.",1155427200,12,1974,5.111801242236025
2155876,1,B00031TXC2,"Antzcak's direction is inexplicable and the film is weighed down by a directionless, melodramatic script and technical shortcomings. The ADR (dialog overdubbing) is incompetent and terribly distracting, making the film sound like a radio drama recorded in a basement; all the more odd considering that in all other respects the project seems well-funded and professional -- great sets, superior costuming and impeccable lighting. The gorgeous cinematography is brutalized by a directorial style characterized by long, tedious dialog punctuated by frenetic, fast-cut flashback and dream sequences that contribute neither to our understanding of Chopin's character nor the events driving the plot forward. Non-sequiturs abound; Antzcak seems to have been attempting to create a mood piece to accompany the brilliant musical performances, rather than a sustained narrative. But the only moods sustained are bewilderment and boredom.

Chopin comes off as a selfish boor of a prima dona; perhaps historically acurate, but hardly compelling on screen. What does it say about this movie that, in a crucial scene where a wagon carrying Chopin nearly topples over a precipice, you find yourself rooting for the precipice?

Unlike the vastly superior Amedeus or the merely pedestrian Immortal Beloved, you learn nothing about the connection between the composer's life and his music. Antzack seems singularly uninterested in the historical signifigance of Chopin's acheivement, the nature of his talent's development, his freindship/rivalry with Liszt, or the musical environment of the day. Desire for Love actually has more in common with a film like Jules et Jim, in that it dwells on the inner dynamics of a doomed and disfunctional romance; unfortunately the characters aren't one tenth as compelling or sympathetic.

Desire for Love ends with the composer's protracted death, like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved did with Mozart and Beethoven, respectively. But it fails to evoke the tragic mood of the latter two; the film itself seems infected by a consumptive, cinematic analog of the protagonist's malaise, eating itself from within and finally wheezing to a merciful termination.",1148860800,20,2177,5.590909090909091

2155878,5,B00031TXC2,"So far this is the most historically correct film on the life of Frederic Chopin I ever seen. Why do you say is George Sand a central figure in this? Simple-Chopin's most poetic and expressive works were created when he had his ""sinful laison"" with this Sand woman. (What the movie failed to show to viewers when Chopin first met Sand, he was revoted by her....Chopin commented ""Is this George Sand really a woman? I tend to doubt it!"") Interesting to note--despite all of the wonderful musical compositions he created while living with her, NOT A SINGLE PIECE OF MUSIC WAS EVER dedicated to Geoge Sand.  Perhaps Chopin was just using George Sand for a stable place to stay, bed and board (I'm not certain of the financial arrangements between these two, but I tend to think she paid most if not all the bills!). Chopin also most likely viewed Sand as socially inferior, and there is evidence he thought her inferior to him, but was equally extremely jealous and possessive of her; remarkably, Chopin was considered an aristrocrat, and not merely a performer of music, among all social circles. So, he never felt her worthy to dedicate a single composition to her.

I tend to think Chopin viewed George Sand as a strong motherly figure who took care of him. As he was very sickly, and possessed an obsessional personality.

True Chopin created his Etudes while he was 19 years old, but never in history was there more beautiful and heavenly tones ever penned during his years with that Sand woman. George Sand cared for him, but her incredibly spoiled children drove a wedge between them. Maurice, the son of Sand, was jealous of his mother's attention to Chopin. Solange--well--she wanted Chopin for herself, and tried to seduce him. Sooo...can you imagine how things went in the family.

Despite all of this perhaps due to the caring of Sand Chopin felt ""settled"" thus produced his most remarkable works.

I would say his film far exceeds the movie ""Impromptu"". Chopin: Desire for Love, if you want to have a pretty good idea of Chopin's personal relationship and how it affected his works, please see this movie. I'm not saying it's 100% accurate, and things historical should in my opinion have been included. (For example, a main reason why the couple took off to Majorica is to escape the SCANDAL.) Still, it's a pretty remarkable work. It's VERY WELL acted. Chopin had a lot to blame for the breakup--he was emotionally cold, easily roused to jealousy, and to add to this Sand's spoiled children. Add years of this sort of behavior. The movie SHOULD have included-Just before the Sand and Chopin breakup, Sand wrote a novel entitled Lucrezia Floriani. I truly believe this was the ""final straw"" that broke up the relationship for it is a thinly disguised account of their rocky relationship. Everybody in social circles, including Franz Liszt, recognized Prince Karole as Chopin, and Lucrezia Floriani as George Sand, even reading to her distingued guests this most back stabbing novel, revealing to all quite shamelessly a thinly disguised account of their own relationship to the world. While Chopin himself listened to the novel being read to her guests, he kept a quiet exterior. It was a kind of revenge George Sand had.  It was not far after this reading, Chopin left Nohant and Sand's life forever.  THAT should have been included in the movie, as I feel it was extremely important contributing to the breakup. Drama Trauma. Can you imagine how it must have felt for Chopin, who is socially conscious, to have his dirty laundry aired before the world?

The Sand-Chopin affair is reflected in Chopin's music-some creations most sublime and highly emotional; others dark and turbulent. Their relationship was the sum total of Romanticism: Emotion, and huge quantities of it, and extreme.  (It was fashionable at the time, for example, to threaten suicide, because it represented emotional turbulence, and anything emotional was....art.)

Did Chopin and this Sand woman really have sex as the movie depicted? To be honest I tend to seriously doubt it. He was infected with tuberculosis, and it's short of a miracle the whole household didn't die of it.

You gotta see this movie! I absolutely worship Frederic Chopin and practice only his music, and I have read many biographical sources of his life including his letters, and George Sand. This movie is closest to the actual relationship that I can think of. I think it's pure genius.

But George Sand should never be seen as a villian, for she was a remarkably liberated woman who was ahead of her time. Remember she existed when the slave trade was going on in the United States in the 1800's. She viewed woman as equals to men, and nothing wrong with being independent. And her contribution of great quantities of love and care toward Chopin that inspired the most sublime works for the pianoforte ever in history that far exceeds the complete powers of an entire orchestra and chorus combined, was undeniable due to the influence of Chopin's love for George Sand.",1146182400,100,5029,4.86214953271028

It was anoying, disgusting and upsetting.",1127692800,8,245,4.857142857142857
2155883,3,B00031TXC2,"This is not the first treatment of the Sand/Chopin love affair. It is the second of the lot that I have seen.  What intrigued me about it was that it was firstly a Polish production and it was mostly from Chopin's point of view.

The costumes and the music were fantastic as was the casting/make-up of showing the dispairity in age and health between Sand and Chopin.  Sand looks more mature but exceedingly healthy while Chopin is clearly younger and weaker.

The movie is a little drawn out, as far as I am concerned. And while it does attempt to explain what went wrong in Sand and Chopin's relationship it never really does much beyond a few Florence Nightengale scenes to show what went right--why they stayed together for eight years, as far as the movie is concerned it was mostly intolerable.  It also wasn't the best at introducing new characters or certain plot points.  I  was only able to figure certain things out from all of the reading about Sand that I have done.

Not only is the movie drawn out, but it also seems disjointed in places. Especially the leap from Majorica and a 12 year old Solange to Paris where Solange is now a woman, in love with Chopin (something that is not a proven fact--only a bit of lore--thought it is true that in his last days he was closer to her than her mother).

I think my favorite scene in the whole of the movie was the moment on the stairs when Chopin informs Sand of her grand-daughter's birth. It was as if it was right out of time, it so captured the awkwardness and lingering pain and longing of what their relationship had degenerated into.

All of the actors do an amazing job. Especially the leads (Chopin and Sand) she is feminine and strong and he looks amazingly like him (though he doesn't play any of the comedy that Hugh Grant did) caputuring that delicacy that Chopin always seemed to  be known for.

Not a bad movie, but probably confusing to anyone who is unfamiliar with the story of Sand and Chopin.",1121299200,11,1970,4.472067039106145
2155884,3,B00031TXC2,"If you've read George Sand's novel Lucrezia Florizani everything about this movie makes perfect sense including its unusually melodramatic style.  Chances are though you haven't unless your a Chopin/Romantic history buff.  It is my understanding that Lucrezia Florizani , though it never mentions Chopin directly is George Sand's scandulous appraisal of their relationship after their breakup. Seeing, that the story is told through her eyes,  and that she was such a writer of taudry novels, makes this movie kind of stylistically facinating. The melodramatic style is taken to a squirmingly edgy extreme.  I can see what thedirector was trying to do. If you are a fan of the Romantic period in history you would probably like this film on one level at the same time it might push on and possibly even disgust your modern sensibilities.",1113868800,8,837,5.132352941176471

Both seemed to be terribly full of themselves - if Chopin was like this, I could have been in the same room with the whiny, spoiled ninny for about 5 minutes. Same with her - what an absolute pretentious, self-involved B----H. Horrible people. It was hard to sympathize with anyone enough to care about the story.",1523750400,,490,4.620689655172414

This is a big movie. And looks shot on film. Yep, film. Film really captures many more emotions. Digital is not here yet.
Music is truly outstanding and pieces are not cut to the bone.
Danuta Stenka as George Sand really deserves a shout out.  Danuta Stenka brings a depth and reality to George Sand that makes our American actor Judy Davis look like a whining, weak, fawning caricature in ""Impromptu"".",1522022400,,658,4.771929824561403

8035899,3,B00031TXC2,"Frederic Chopin, the son of a French teacher and a Polish noblewoman, was a musical genius like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, only that he didn't have a composer father to take him all over Europe when he was a young child. Unfortunately Chopin, the greatest piano composer of all time is still waiting for a movie biography that can do some justice to his life. In 1945 Cornel Wilde played very nicely the role of Chopin in the film ""A Song to Remember"", a beautiful production with exotic beauty Merle Oberon as Georges Sand. The cast is great but, unfortunately, since famous actor Paul Muni was playing Chopin's first music teacher, Josef Elsner, they ""sent"" Professor Elsner to Paris with Chopin and he becomes the center piece of the story, but in reality, Elsner never went to Paris with Chopin and he disappeared from Frederic's life completely. This Polish film completely skips Chopin's colorful childhood, and is nothing more than an imaginary soap opera between a French female writer and a Polish pianist and composer. The music doesn't play an important role except for brief fragments of some of Chopin's gorgeous compositions. I would watch this movie again only to enjoy the beauty of Bozena Stachura, who plays Georges Sand's daughter Solange!",1487289600,2,1256,4.957345971563981
