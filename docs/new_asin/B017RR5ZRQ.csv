7512861,2,B017RR5ZRQ,"Great acting.
Ambiguous ending well done can be good.
In this case it felt like the last 5 pages of the script were missing. Otherwise a semi-powerful experience of an insufferable twenty-something white guy going through a difficult situation with a parent. There's one excellent scene with said white guy and said parent. The rest is meh.",1459641600,,340,4.982456140350878

7512863,1,B017RR5ZRQ,"I'd give this no stars if it weren't for Nixon's transcendent performance as the dying mother of the miserable mope referred to in the title.

Look, I LIVE two blocks from where this is supposedly set, I love ""avant garde"" anti-Hollywood films, and I lost my own mother in very similar fashion at a similar age to the title character.

BUT MY GOD this writer-director makes Jane Austen look like Karl Marx when it comes to social consciousness/awareness, ESPECIALLY in the year of ""Black Lives Matter."" POOR lives matter too--I was a college professor when my parents died and I KNEW I was lucky enough to have three months paid leave to care for them.  Why the fk do we give a bleep about this whining wackamole whose consciousness is bounded by the dimensions of his own navel?

THIS fkn self-pitying, over-educated, unemployed whiner?  HE complains that he NEEDS A BREAK from his ONLY job, which is that he's fortunate enough to care for his terminally ill mom in their palatial Upper West Side apartment, all expenses paid for YEARS.  I had to return to work two weeks before my father died of brain cancer, as it turned out, and I would have KILLED to have been there. THIS FKN JERK ACTUALLY WHINES THAT HE'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH CREDIT FOR A PHARMACY RUN.

The writer-director almost literally throws in Kid Cudi as the most overtly token race-bait move I've seen in years.  This Uncle Tom character is so laughably underwritten that I almost needed an oxygen mask I was guffawing so hard. You talk about a liberal white fantasy of  the black man loyal to his massuh!  I's'll clean up yo messes, Massah White! I'se'll pay fer yo drugs and drinks, Massuh White!  I'se'll stay behind and take care uh yo mammy's corpse while youse goes and smokes you a cigarette!!

The title character begins and ends as a total spoiled punk who redefines narcissism.  I guess he's ""redeemed"" because he doesn't actually smoke crack when his mother is actually dying? Wow, that explains the halo.  I wonder why anyone would waste time, film, and money on such a waste of skin,bone, space, and oxygen?  UNLESS IT IS MAYBE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL???? HMMMMM.",1458691200,2,2135,4.716981132075472
7512864,4,B017RR5ZRQ,"James White is presented as a twenty something young man with leanings towards hedonism and is currently living on his mothers couch whilst looking after her  this is along with the news that his father has died.  The film tracks his life over a number of months and it soon becomes clear that his mother is seriously unwell and needs him to step up to the plate.

What this is though is a reflection of his journey and how he deals with it. His hedonism is shown as someone who wants to go out and have a good time  sometimes too much of a good thing turns bad and that is also the case here. It is all parts of lifes rich tapestry. Christopher Abbot as White (A Most Violent Year) carries the role perfectly; he has smouldering good looks that are underplayed by his apparent lack of panache. This leads to an enigmatic and at times powerfully realistic performance.

Anyone who has had to deal with great personal loss will find it easy to empathise here and also the understanding that it affects us all differently and at different times. That raw essence of feeling and emotion is captured extremely well here. Having said all of the above this is still a hard film to watch in places  and that is a good thing in many respects. If you like your films to be more honest and deal with things too often glossed over then you may very well find something to like here.",1458259200,3,1371,4.356862745098039
7512865,5,B017RR5ZRQ,"One of the best independent films of recent years, if not THE best. Brilliantly performed, written, made. Excellent all around, well worth your time.",1454803200,5,149,5.25

First-time writer-director Josh Mond has fashioned a cinema-verit style drama based on his own experiences of losing his mother to cancer. During a recent Q&A, I learned that he bonded with noted actress Cynthia Nixon who plays the mother of the title character James White, and who also lost her own mother to cancer.

What I liked about Mond's protagonist James White, is that he's no sad sackhe's a character that basically likes himself despite tussling with a few demons deep down inside. One critic described James White as an ""antisocial delinquent."" Others might refer to him as a ""Ne'er do well"" but I think ""sociopath"" is a more appropriate moniker.

I've met a few people like James White in my life and I'm struck by their narcissism, aggressiveness and almost complete lack of a sense of moral responsibility or social conscience. Still, as we see in Mond's somewhat compelling portrait, James has an honorable side too, manifested in his devotion to his mother, who leans on him for support in her last dying days.

When we first meet James, his father (who left the family years ago), has just died and his mother is holding Shivah, the traditional Jewish mourning period, for the family of the father's second wife at her apartment. James appears disheveled after a night of carousing at a nightclub and inappropriately throws everyone out after taking offense at his non-relatives watching a video of his father's wedding to the second wife.

Soon afterward, to make matters worse, Nick, a friend of his, gets into a fight at a bar and James also joins in and almost provokes a complete free for all. James promises his mother Gail that he'll look for a job but he needs to take a break first, so he goes down to Mexico with Nick, who recently obtained a job as a clown at a resort.

You might wonder how a guy with no prospects like James can so easily find a girlfriend but he has no troubles picking up a woman who he meets down in Mexico, employing a series of glib and subtle pick-up lines. It's a sad commentary that women often are attracted to ""bad boys,"" all the while ignoring the obvious signs that the guy they've become interested in, has little moral conscience.

At the midpoint, James suddenly gets a call from his mother that she's experienced a relapse with her cancer, which is now Stage 4. Dutifully, James returns back to New York City where he becomes more unhinged due to his mother's rapid decline and it appears that he's now taking some kind of drugs (he almost gets into another fight, this time with Nick, and accidentally cuts himself).

James is unable to fool Ben, a family friend, who interviews him for a job as a writer. James comes to the interview again disheveled and hands in his poetry, scribbled on loose leaf pages, as a writing sample. Ben tells James that he can come back and interview again, if and when he gets himself together. Nonetheless, James tells his mother that he got the job.

The rest of the film focuses on James' noble effort to assist and comfort his mother as she succumbs to the ravages of cancer. Despite James' unhealthy co-dependent relationship with his mother, his actions reflect a positive side that we haven't seen earlier. In this respect, we find that James attains a measure of redemption in the good deeds he performs for his mother. Mond's unflinching portrait of a cancer victim (as well as Nixon's startling performance) is quite commendable as there's no sugar coating of this terrible disease.

Christopher Abbott's performance is also quite convincing. Nonetheless, Mond's script feels truncated and the denouement, abrupt. I wanted to see what happens to James Whitehow he turns out. Despite the underdeveloped nature of Mond's story, he's a talent to watch and I'm convinced there are good things to come with future offerings.",1453507200,3,3868,4.76831091180867
