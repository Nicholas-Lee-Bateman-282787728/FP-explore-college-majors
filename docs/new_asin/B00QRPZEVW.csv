6877709,3,B00QRPZEVW,"Oh, my, wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this DVD for my granddaughter. This was such a disappointment. The oryline is wonderful, good Barbie, Kara has magical powers to fight wrong, and her nemesis tries to undue everything good.

What we have here is some sort of replica Barbie who does not measure up. My 7 year old granddaughter could tell something was very wrong. You cannot fool children. She told me she did not like this video, and we put it away. Too bad to spoil a Barbie film, but that us what we have.

Not Recommended. prisrob 08-21-16",1471737600,3,563,4.509803921568627

This particular one we rented at the kiosk, and didn't actually purchase when it was available in the stores.  I luckily remembered to check Amazon, and she was thrilled to the core when it arrived!

6877743,3,B00QRPZEVW,Of all the Barbie movies this is probably one of my least favorites. I rented this for my daughters because they love Barbie (especially the Rock N' Royals)...but this one didn't really grab their attention. The story itself seemed to jump from one idea to the next like first Barbie is flying in some contraption then all of a sudden she is a princess. It was disjointed and not very magical to watch as other Barbie movies. I am glad I rented this rather than buy it.,1454198400,,469,4.402298850574713

6877749,1,B00QRPZEVW,Just a heads up that I wish I would have known before purchasing......the book has over 10 pages (front and back) dedicated to scary legos.  Its a large section of the book.  We don't do scary and we are going to get rid of those pages but I wish I would have known.,1451433600,,266,4.0

6877752,3,B00QRPZEVW,"Ugh, barbie!  But my daughters love these movies.  We started with Barbie and the Secret Door and have watched at least five others now.  Really, the Secret Door one was loads better than the rest of these.  Before this they loved (and still do) the Tinkerbell movies.  Thought those provided good lessons about making mistakes and owning up to them, friendship, etc.  I would say these Barbie movies are a few notches below that level in terms of storytelling and WAY below in terms of visual quality.  Hope this helps!",1450137600,,520,4.711111111111111
6877753,3,B00QRPZEVW,My 5 year old got hooked on Barbie movies after seeing Barbie and the Secret Door.  The music is great in that movie!  We were excited for Princess Power but it just doesn't quite have the same appeal for her.  She got the doll along with the movie for her birthday.  The Barbie doll looks nothing like the character in the movie! It's a cute movie but I wish we'd just Redboxed it.,1449532800,,382,4.191780821917808

Cannot beat the convenience of ordering instant videos online - we had no time to go to video store, suddenly needed something to keep 7 year old occupied and distracted from feeling bad.

6877821,3,B00QRPZEVW,"Ok, the 3 stars are a compromise. I thought it was pretty lame but my girls loved it. However, and this is the part that shocks me, I usually really like the Barbie movies. I never saw it coming that I would prefer Barbie over Disney, but I've seen Barbie evolve into a show where the emphasis is on CHARACTER, as opposed to Disney which is increasingly shallow, distressed on princess and there's always kissing....not to mention how they always kill off at least one parent. Wth? I finally banned all Disney princess movies after my youngest daughter asked if she was pretty enough to be kissed by a prince. I don't think my 4 year old needs to be thinking about prince charming and being kissed. So while this wasn't my fave movie, I'll still be a Barbie convert and stay away from desperate princesses and bratz dressed like street walking ho's.",1437436800,,849,4.555555555555555

6877837,1,B00QRPZEVW,"As a parent, I cringe at the idea that I actually purchased this for my daughter. Weak plot. Animation is definitely sub-par. Barbie is animated suspiciously mimicking the style of Elastigirl in Disney/Pixar's ""The Incredibles"". I agree, she does not look like your traditional Barbie as portrayed by the doll and other movies. While on ""The Incredibles"" subject, watch the trailer for this movie. Note the music in the background? Sounds similar to ""The Incredibles"".  In general, when a movie promotion compares itself to a blockbuster, it's a bad sign.  Not worth the $14.99 spent on it. I learned my lesson when it comes to these Barbie movies: Each one really is an uncertain matter aka ""crap shoot"". Some are great, some are just complete garbage. For now on, I will first rent, then decide whether I will purchase for my daughter.",1435881600,2,837,4.887323943661972

6877873,1,B00QRPZEVW,"Barbie is disrespectful, jealous, spiteful, and no longer a good role model in Princess Power. What happened to the old Barbie who was graceful and poised when faced with danger? When she didn't childishly mock them, but eloquently explain the lesson of the movie? Nope. Barbie is jealous of her sister for trying to compete with her, disrespects her parents, and is mean and sarcastic towards her friends. This is NOT a good role model for young girls, but an example of how NOT to act. Stick to almost any Barbie movie prior such as Pearl Princess or the Mariposa series. Those Barbies are fabulous role models.",1433030400,3,613,4.738317757009346

Barbie looks sickly and it gives the impression this was a quick production just to get another movie out and make a few bucks.  It was so distracting that it lost my attention quickly, but my kids still seemed to enjoy it.  My 6 year old daughter did mention that Barbie looked unusual as well.  Unfortunately, I think they missed the target with this movie in a lot of ways.

She tried to watch it, but it just didn't hold her attention as well as ""Island Princess"" or ""A Mermaid Tale"" or ""The Princess and The Pauper"" Barbie movies did.  I also didn't like the way she treated her cousin.  I felt like the creators were trying to make a more 'flawed' Barbie character, but I like that Barbie is always unfailingly happy and kind to everyone, even if they didn't deserve her kindness.  Those are qualities I want my daughter to have.  I did not like seeing her openly compete against her cousin, rooting for herself to succeed and her cousin fail.  I also felt like this just wasn't as interesting of a story as some of the others, and I kinda missed the catchy music that the older movies had.

6877929,1,B00QRPZEVW,"I have two little girls and we like many of the Barbie movies, especially the films with Barbie and her sisters, Princess and the Pop Star, Secret Door, the Nutcracker, and the surfer girl/mermaid movies. I was really excited that Barbie was finally in a super hero movie as the heroin, but this movie was disappointing for so many reasons. First of all the animation and character design is HORRIBLE! All of the characters look like weird aging aliens. I am not saying that everyone is supposed to be beautiful and flawless, but I really can't stand watching these anorexic alien type looking characters! Please don't continue this in the future Barbie films! They seriously remind me of an extremely skinny person who tans too much and turned their skin to leather and had one too many facelifts.
Also I feel like we have seen this villain before, he really reminded me of the villain in Pearl Princess. they could have done something way cooler and more entertaining. Why not try a villain who is as cool and complex as the villains in the My Little Pony show? Princess Luna, the changelings, and Discord just to name a few are so interesting and fun for children to watch, we don't always need to see the safe approach of the bad man who is greedy and obsessed with power. The other Barbie movies had better villains than this movie, like Malucia, Eris, and the Mouse King (voiced by Tim Curry!), but this is a Super hero movie, the villain should have been AWESOME!
I also found this movie to be less interesting than other Barbie movies with a storyline that was really lacking. Our children deserve better than this! As I said, we are fans of the Barbie movies, can't wait for the next movie, but not if they put out more like this one!",1429747200,2,1743,4.554140127388535

This movie was just awesome! I loved almost everything, I loved the music and really liked how Addison and the other girl were smart, but fab. It had just a couple of things I did not like:
1. Barbie looks SO weird. Her body, arms, and legs are way too small, making her look puny and not at all like a Barbie.
2. Her hair is way, way too perfect!
3. Her cousin is a total snob; I hated her part!

The colors on this movie are bright and graphics are beautiful but Barbie doesn't look anything like she did in any of the other DVDs.  Her voice is the same, but she looks......strange.  To be quite honest, it looks like superhero Barbie needs to eat something before flying off to fight crime.  Her cheeks are sunken in and she looks skeleton-like with huge blue eyes.  Kind of creepy.  I'm all for a ridiculous story blot and side kicks with blue and hot pink hair but the inconsistency of the actual Barbie character I found annoying.  I really liked all the other Barbie movies where that character had a sweeter, more natural appearance.

6877973,3,B00QRPZEVW,"while I understand due to the fact that Barbie has superhero powers in this movie & needs to 'save the day', I forgot that also means that there is A LOT of violence in it (beating up the bad guys).  And there is A LOT. Constant.  There is one scene with barbie as a superhero racing in the air through a burning building carrying out a bad guy and dumping him at the police station. It was pretty graphic (as barbie movies go, at least).  I sat there with my 4 year old cringing & clinging onto me due to the realistic looking fire.  My daughter is an avid barbie movie lover but this one she's just not ready for yet.  Maybe it's ok for the 7-8 year old age bracket, but not for the 4-5 year olds. Luckily I rented this movie via my library before I purchased it.  Ironically the next week when we were in TRU she rec'd begged for the barbie superhero costume and said NO THANKS when I pointed to the movie (I posted a pic of her in the costume...it's made well)

side note: one of her favorite Barbie movies is 'Diamond Castle' and there are a bunch of reviews on how that one also has a few violent scenes, but for some reason - having Barbie almost fall off a cliff into lava is less threatening than seeing bad guys constantly get beat up. Also Diamond Castle has a lot of singing in it - this one is not a musical.

Lastly - just as others have pointed out, the animation in this movie is off.  Barbie looks unrealistic stick thin....not a healthy girl like she does in her other movies (Princess & Popstar, Secret Door, Mermaid Tale, etc). Thin is one thing, but the animation in this one is definitely off.",1427846400,8,1615,4.200647249190938

It seems like they rushed this movie just to get it out and bring in some revenue for the first quarter because I don't know much about movies but when it doesnt flow smoothly or has a story that doesnt fit in, and stands out to me, I am sure many other people will notice many more flaws than me.",1427587200,,595,3.925619834710744

She treated her so called friends more like geeky servants (she probably forced them to do her homework when she was in school). Her helicopter parents were completely ridiculous, and it's no wonder they didn't allow her to do anything. She didn't give them anything to work with. Not to mention their sudden change of heart and they allow her to continue being a super hero, even though the whole kingdom knows but suddenly conveniently forgets. The only thing that was half way believable was how big headed she got after she got her powers. But please, could they have come up with a better name than 'Super Sparkle and Dark Sparkle'?

6877981,2,B00QRPZEVW,"Now I am not one of those who is anti-Barbie for body image.  I think the previous animated Barbies were just lovely.  Yes, Barbie has always been thin, but in previous movies she looked healthy and trim, not as though she was starving.  I love the animation style (body and face) of the previous Barbie movies such as ""A Mermaid's Tale"" or ""Fashion Fairy Tale"".  Even last year's offering ""Secret Door"" was better than this.

In this movie, ""Princess Power"", Barbie has toothpick legs and arms, as do her friends.  Her hair is an ugly brassy blond, as opposed to the previous gold or platinum.  The hair was animated as a thick mass of helmut, with no movement to it or stray pieces.  The facial features are unrealistic and cartoony, with ugly shading to make her appear even more gaunt.  She does not look at all like a powerful superhero, and she doesn't even look like the Barbie doll.

We own over 10 Barbie movies.  But if they continue to be put out with this style and fashion, we will no longer be purchasing.

6877993,4,B00QRPZEVW,"Well, after reading some of the reviews on this movie, I decided to rent this before buying it.  My girls, (age 4 and 6) absolutely LOVE it.  Their 8 yr old brother secretly watched it with them, too.  We have enjoyed almost every other Barbie movie, but this one isn't my favorite.  I really wanted it to be, because super heroes are awesome!  The story is a little silly, even for Barbie.  And I agree with some of the other reviews about Barbie's new look in this movie, she looks freaky!!  Very skeletal face and way too big of eyes.  Over all, though, its super clean, cute and fun.  And I will probably buy it, along with some of the dolls for upcoming b-days, because my girls can't stop being Super Sparkle!",1426550400,,715,4.356060606060606

6878001,3,B00QRPZEVW,"My daughter enjoyed this movie a lot, as we enjoy many of the Barbie movies. This one seems to move closer to the inevitably temper of contemporary popular stories. Even the wider-set and larger eyes Barbie sports in this film, as compared to her others, cause the face to appear slightly deformed. The storyline lacks the classical grace of the early Barbie movies or the substantial vigor and originality of some of the more recent ones. Once again we are treated to the King/Father who doesn't understand his independent and adventuresome daughter. However, I understand why this storyline resonates for the up-and-coming generation, raised by helicopter parents who are over-stimulated by the constant terror of highly-publicized acts of predation.

Overall, though, nothing objectionable.",1426204800,4,793,5.4471544715447155
6878002,3,B00QRPZEVW,"Yikes, what happened to Barbie she looks like one of those vinyl bendy dolls. I thought the comments about her getting skinny were exaggerated until I saw the movie,  I am a skinny person and thats not skinny she looked distorted. We love all the Barbie movies because of all the vivid colors and beautiful animation but this didn't have the same look and feel at all. Overall, my 6 year old liked it, not as much as the other ones. I did like the idea of Barbie being a super hero. I just wish they made her look stronger and healthier, it didn't even look like Barbie and I wish in general the animation was better in general. Worth a watch but nothing special.. Hopefully they go back to the old look and feel next movie",1426204800,,723,4.2773722627737225

6878015,3,B00QRPZEVW,"While this has the typically mind numbing Barbie movie plot and dialogue, having a female superhero was really great. But Barbie, normally thin, looks painfully gaunt in the movie. Worth a view if you have a child looking for any excuse to run around the house in a cape, but keep your expectations low.",1425945600,3,303,4.62962962962963

6878017,5,B00QRPZEVW,"I thought it was a very fun, very different take on Barbie as a heroine. I got the DVD, but if you're a fan and looking for ultra bright and colorful, totally get the Blu-ray. I didn't care so much for the animation--nothing like the Pearl Princess or The Secret Door--Barbie was a little too thin and her facial features weren't quite so pretty, but I can get past that. The story was fun, bright and cheerful. It's excellent for feminine empowerment for little girls, and has a good message about team work, prioritizing, and finding your inner strength. I recommend it to every Barbie girl.",1425859200,,593,4.60377358490566

6878020,5,B00QRPZEVW,"I've been a fan of Barbie movies since I was a child, and have enjoyed seeing the films evolve over the years.  When I heard about this superhero one, I was psyched!  I bought the Blu-ray the second it came out.  I love all things superhero, and I knew just from that alone that this movie would rock.  However, this movie went way beyond my expectations.

The animation has stepped up, the music is catchy, and the plot is clever and fast-paced.  It doesn't lollygag around with tea parties and giggling animals. This movie is proof of how far Barbie movies have come over time.  It's empowering.  It's feminist.  It's fun.  I've found the latest films rather refreshing.  Overall, I was extremely impressed, and I'd go as far as saying this is my favorite Barbie movie to date.  I guess it goes without saying that I'm looking forward to the next one!",1425600000,3,853,4.5394736842105265
6878021,5,B00QRPZEVW,"Barbie is back in Princess Power, a fresh, lively and highly entertaining installment to the Barbie series of movies.
In this movie, Barbie plays Kara, a princess who gains super powers after being kissed by a magical butterfly (no need for radioactive creepy-crawlies here!) With help from her two friends, Madison and Makalya, she learns to use and sharpen her new abilities with often humorous results (especially since she can't seem to avoid crashing into the same tree every time she tries to fly). Before long, she has the skills, the equipment and of course the snazzy costume to go forth and fight crime in her kingdom as ""Super Sparkle.""
But as we soon find out, you can't really have a super heroine without a super rival, in this case brought about by her cousin Corrine, who is jealous of Kara's position and powers. Corrine becomes aware of Kara's secret and uses this knowledge to acquire super powers of her own, leading to some great sequences as both supers step on each other's toes in their efforts to be the foremost heroine in Windemere.
But the fun doesn't stop there. While Corrine (as ""Dark Sparkle"") presents a mere rival for Super Sparkle's public attention and acclaim, the real threat, Baron von Ravendale, adviser to the king, is making plans to take over the kingdom with help from his amphibious sidekick, a good comic relief character.
During the story, a local reporter following the exploits of Super Sparkle for his blog, presents a major breach in super hero etiquette when he blatantly reveals Sparkle's secret identity to the public (most super villains wouldn't even sink that low!) and this does little to help Super Sparkle against the ruthless Ravendale's scheming.
Ultimately the super heroines learn it sometimes takes two to defeat an enemy, and they must team up in order to save the kingdom from Ravendale and win the day, showing that true friendship is still stronger than their rivalry.
This movie is fun, light-hearted entertainment for the whole family. If you like Barbie, super heroes or both, this movie is a great one to add to your collection. My family loved it, yours will too! Enjoy!",1425513600,5,2144,4.860655737704918

6878023,3,B00QRPZEVW,"I think the animation was better in some ways, but Barbie and all of the other women looked gaunt and almost skeleton like at some angles with a tiny neck and a strange, too skinny, gumbie like body.  I really hope they go back to the old Barbie style of animation because I don't want my girls emulating a Barbie that looks like that.  I was slightly disturbed the entire time I was watching the movie.
I don't mind seeing Barbie get upset because that is normal in real life and she apologizes for her behavior later in the movie.  Purchasing one Barbie movie like this is ok, but I sincerely hope there are no more animated in this fashion.  We will not buy them if they are which would be sad because we own all of the other Barbie movies and my 4 girls love them!
I hope this is helpful.  :)",1425427200,17,796,4.176470588235294

My 7 year old was looking forward to it.  From the moment it came on, we all became critical.  Their faces do not look the same.  Whoever animated this one, clearly did not do the others or even look at them.  The eyes look more anime like.  Their faces thin in some spots not in others....in other words Barbie did not look like Barbie!  Neither did her friends.  It was also the first time I have seen them showing Barbie getting mad & angry, and taking it out on someone.  Is this the Barbie we know?
My 7 year old who adores Barbie movies said, ""Eh, its OK.  I wish you hadn't wasted your money to buy it!"" Her sister, ""Boy, what is Barbie doing?  They used to make awesome movies.""  They are both right.",1425254400,47,857,4.184049079754601
