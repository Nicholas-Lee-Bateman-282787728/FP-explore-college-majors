1862383,5,B00008UALF,"Complex study of the dynamic effects of various family pressures that affect the characters...

Sean Connery is excellent as the charismatic type who is irreverent, with a criminal side...

Dustin Hoffman gives a very good performance as the Dad who seems to feel somewhat inadequate competing with the charisma of the Connery character...

Broderick does well as the understated son, who is drawn to Connery's 'fun' rebellious personality...

Terrific performances, film creates a unique atmosphere, the action sequences drive the story to a powerful ending...",1167696000,3,561,5.564705882352941
1862384,5,B00008UALF,"You can pick this movie up for a song these days and given that it is over 16 years old now if you haven't seen it yet add this one to your library.

If you want a good drama about a multi-generational dysfunctional family then this movie is for you.

Just buy it, watch it, again and again!",1126483200,8,291,4.0
1862385,4,B00008UALF,"And Sidney Lumet behind the camera?  This had all the earmarks of greatness but FAMILY BUSINESS is what its principal characters are:  under achievers.  But what great fun!  This is Connery chewing scenery ( dinner at Vito's, the prison van, the Pee Wee Grogan story).  Vincent Patrick, who wrote the screenplay from his own novel, knows NYC street people and the landscape is genuine.  There's worse things to waste 100 minutes on than this.",1083801600,5,442,4.905405405405405
1862386,5,B00008UALF,"Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman, and Mathew Broderick play profession-thief grandfather, conservative father, and innovative-genius son. When genius son invites Gramps in on a hiest, Daddy gets upset and vows to do anything  to stop them. But the sins of the father, inherited from the grandfather,  make piety a difficult sell. Terrific crime caper with many unexpected  twists.",962496000,,376,5.56140350877193

1862403,4,B00008UALF,"The main characters are the reason this movie is as good as it is. Connery, Hoffman and Broderick are a family that is involved and evolves thru crime. The movie moves thru a major heist the youngest family member decides to involve his father and grand father in. The twists and complications make the movie evolve. Good cast and an ok movie, drags some but does have enough action to keep the movie going.",1389312000,,407,4.513513513513513

1862406,1,B00008UALF,"Another candidate for greatest waste of money and talent on an artistic endeavor.

If a movie can be summed up in one sentence, to which only a bored reaction is possible, it cannot be a good movie. Hence ""Men in a family botch a stupid crime and ruin their own lives and the lives of their loved ones"". That's it. No humor, no moral insights, no twists of fate, no intrigue, no redeeming events, no nothing. I would have settled for a lame deus ex machina turn, anything would have been better than this boring tripe. Major thumbs-down.",1384387200,,537,4.479591836734694

1862408,3,B00008UALF,"Connery and Hoffman are strong in their respective roles, but the producers seem to have been intent on promoting Broderick's career in this film and they sure failed to impress me. Broderick's character, Adam, hatches a criminal scheme, primarily for excitement, but then acts devastated when he actually get's caught, and is happy to let his granddad (Connery) take the fall while he moralizes with his father (Hoffman) who turned state's evidence to save Adam from a long jail term. Further aggravating is that Adam has no means of support but is always impeccably dressed and waxing philosophic about how best to live life. How can a 23 year old kid who's never held a job advise others on how to live?",1362960000,,706,4.795081967213115
1862409,5,B00008UALF,"Didn't know anything about this movie when another family member brought it home from the library. Had low expectations considering it was a Sidney Lumet film with a stellar cast but I'd never heard of it. The story was very simple but the acting was top grade. Lumet got great performances from everyone, but especially Dustin Hoffman and Sean Connery -- one of the best examples of complete immersion into the characters that I can remember witnessing in a film. With less compelling performances this would have been a forgettable film for me, but after watching the film I immediately went to Amazon to add the movie to my collection. I've watched the film several times since, just focusing on the acting performances (to see if I was wrong) and each time I've been further impressed. Everyone is good in this film, but I felt I was educated on the fine art of acting by watching Hoffman and Connery's performances in this film -- and they made it seem so natural and effortless (perhaps the greatest achievement of all). This movie may not be everyone's cup of tea but I'd venture to say that no one would be disappointed after watching it. In my opinion a passed over gem.",1337644800,4,1179,4.645933014354067
1862410,5,B00008UALF,Great transaction and I recommend seller. Movie is one of Connery's best but not well known performances.,1280275200,2,105,5.235294117647059

1862412,5,B00008UALF,"I own this movie and have enjoyed watching it many time and sharing it with my friends & relatives.  If you'd like to see another side of Sean Connery, and enjoy the work of the versatile Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick, then you'll like this combination of drama mixed with a little light humor. This is a good one !",1240790400,,322,4.366666666666666

1862414,5,B00008UALF,"Connery,Hoffman and Broderick is not the typical cast . Would you in your wildest dreams picture Dustin Hoffman as an Italian named Vito? Not only that but Sean Connerys son? Not only that but Matthew Brodericks father? Watch and you will believe!  Sidney Lumet is a brilliant director and he pulls this one off beautifully!  Its wonderful fun!!!!  I enjoyed it tremendously!!!",1176940800,3,377,5.048387096774194
1862415,4,B00008UALF,"Sidney Lumet has directed some of the best actor (Fonda, Connery, Pacino. Holden, Widmark) and the worst (Vin Diesel). However this cute drama/comedy caper is cute at best and not worth his talents. If not for the three leads (Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman, and Matthew Broderick) who are involved, this film would be forgetable.

Connery plays Jesse, the elder stateman of the McMullin clan who is part irish/part scot. Jesse is also a career criminal who has been out and in of jails. His son Vito (Hoffman) (part scot irish and Italian)was raised in the life of burglary and is trying to go straight with his meat packing business. Vito's son adam (Broderick)  (who is part scot/irish/italian and Jewish on his mother's side) was gifted with a silver spoon in his mouth. Adam  rather join the family business and be a thief like his Grandfather Jesse. The family dynamic works well with these three leads together, it breaks apart with they do not play scenes like a trio

None of the actors are the weakest link in this film, it lays in the script itself. Lumet uses too many two long shots and two shots to make sure at least two of the trio is always together.

The talent is on the DVD. One could wish one of these films giants  or Lumet would have done an audio commentary, but none have come to pass.

So steal this DVD for your collection

7986999,5,B00008UALF,"Another film sadly neglected in its day that deserves revaluation.  The offbeat nature of this work probably resulted in its lukewarm critical and box office reception.  I think what was off putting at the time was its curious ethnic casting.  We have to accept Dustin Hoffman as Sean Connery's son.  In turn we have to buy Hoffman as a Sicilian Scotsman.  Not the least Latina Rosana Desoto plays a Jew.  These are such adept actors, however, that you quickly suspend disbelief.  Vincent Patrick successfully adapts his source novel much like he did with ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"" released earlier in the decade.  ""Family Business"" is essentially an exploration of family bonds.  For better or for worse the bonds that tie the McMullens is larceny.  Ultimately, though, what is revealed is it isn't so much the money its the thrill of planning and pulling off the caper.  Sean Connery is an absolute lifeforce as gregarious patriarch Jesse.  Hoffman is appropriately subdued as the cautious Vito.  Matthew Broderick continues his graduation to adult roles as the bored scholar Adam looking for excitement in his life.  If memory serves Broderick followed this up with terrific work in Edward Zwick's ""Glory"" rightfully considered a masterpiece.  How can you dislike a film that serves up not one but two memorable Irish wake scenes?  Anybody following the trajectory of director Sidney Lumet's will recognize that ""Family Business"" is a piece with his canon.",1518307200,,1465,5.092436974789916
