14881,5,0767817486,"This movie is based on the real-life experience of Brad Davis, a 20ish man who is caught and thrown in prison in Istanbul, Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country to sell to a couple of friends.
It is a commentary on the brutal and inhumane treatment of people who are imprisoned in other countries.  Granted, he broke the law, but nobody deserves to be tortured, beaten, and psychologically devastated as he was.  It brings to home the fact that, when traveling abroad, Americans must always be aware that the laws and enforcement of those laws are VERY different in other countries.
SPOILER ALERT:  ONLY APPROPRIATE FOR ADULTS TO VIEW - graphic violence, torture, nudity and sexual situations.",1516838400,,711,4.859504132231405

14887,2,0767817486,"Unethical film producers, actors, director, Oliver Stone et al: Midnight Express ""uses"" (as a drugie would) a ""true"" situation or story to tell whatever lies they want to.  I watched this with my male friend and at the end we both turned to each other and said, ""Never go to Turkey.""  Others have said, ""Never smuggle drugs in Turkey.""  The movie failed to make a legitimate point, or explore a theme.  It exploited drugs, violence, and sex.  It simple took pleasure in machismo -- whether hetero or homo machismo.  IT FAILED TO EXPLORE THE TRULY HUMAN.

I had hope when I saw the father come to visit the son -- as in the movie ""In the Name of the Father"" a 5 star movie about prison, cross-cultural (Irish-English) life.  But when I saw the father shout threats at the prison warden for no other reasons than sheer anger-indulgence, I realized this movie was probably bankrupt.  The movie reflects immaturity and failure to develop a controlling vision.  There were SO many wonderful ways this material could have gone.  The creative potential was enormous.  The 70's macho culture could only see this?  Slaves to their narrow world view.

The only thing good:  the cinematography, and evocative music and some of the nonviolent prison scenarios.  I was reminded of Dante's circles of hell.  Then a little research was in order.  I was thinking of Turkey's struggles between secular democracy (Ataturk's reforms) and its Medieval past.  There were clearly two power structures and judges (the secular and the religious?) struggling for dominance.  I was thinking of the issue of individual justice and the needs of society to make an example of Billy etc etc etc...But director and producers did nothing to develop any ideas.  I have so many ideas about how this material could have been developed....  it is frustrating to see that too often this type of junk wins out.

I don't trust Oliver Stones movies about ""real life.""  That is a joke.  Real life is more interesting and rich and meaningful than what he ""created"" -- here at least.

Go to YouTube and get the backstory on this movie. That is far more interesting.  Billy is kind of despicable, but if they had honestly told his story, perhaps tweaking it here and there...the movie would have been much better.  Billy claims the experience was the best thing that happened to him!!  Why didn't they run with that?  These guys failed to go deep into the human condition, instead they got hung up on violence and sex and machismo.  Not to mention that Turkey's tourist industry has never recovered -- apparently because of this film.",1509926400,,2590,4.791855203619909

I had forgotten how much the music set the tone of the film. Adding the suspense and fear to the viewer with the sound of the main character's heartbeat. Add in the bleak scenes at the Airport and the grim scenery of the Turkish prison and you're in the element with Billy Hayes. A real lesson for all. Don't ever consider smuggling anything especially not drugs anywhere. Always respect the laws of the land cause it could change your life forever if you don't.

Yuck. Midnight Express opened a whole new world for me, and I am grateful for that. I especially loved John Hurt and Randy Quaid. I loved Brad Davis in some scenes.

15028,3,0767817486,"Four stars for screenplay writing, technical execution and acting:
The well-written Oliver Stone screenplay vaulted him into his screenwriting and directing career. Likewise, the film vaulted Alan Parker who had directed commercials and several short films, into his feature film career. Brad Davis was also a first-timer in a major role and his performance was stellar, with a promising career wasted and cut short by uncontrolled drug abuse and contracting aids. Not surprising it was nominated for numerous Oscars, as the story they filmed was compelling. Unfortunately, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not often consider how a film represented to the public as a true story actually aligns with the real facts.

One Star for Gross Inaccuracy:
Granted, it wasn't a documentary, or even a docu-drama, but it was marketed as the story about William Hayes, his arrest, imprisonment, and subsequent escape. The problem is not ""artistic license"" liberties with minor details and conflation (e.g. combining characters or locations) to reduce scope and run time. The problem is the film doesn't much resemble what actually occurred other than Hayes being arrested for smuggling hashish at the airport, being tried for it, being convicted and sentenced for it, being re-sentenced to a longer prison term, and escaping to Greece some years later. Nearly everything else that fleshes out the story is a fabrication, gross exaggeration, or gross caricature. The Turkish criminal justice and prison system leaves much to be desired, and it does suffer from some corruption, but it's not nearly the kind of capricious judicial decision-making or the level of depraved, sadistic cruelty depicted in the movie. The real story isn't quite as compelling and has a tougher time garnering sympathy for the protagonist. Knowing the factual events of Hayes' arrest, trial and imprisonment, I don't have much sympathy for what he actually suffered in the Turkish prisons. He was 23 years old, knew what he was doing was a crime (and not a trivial one), and intuitively knew the punishment could be quite severe if he were caught and arrested in Turkey for smuggling roughly 2 kilos (4 pounds) of hashish. It's not drug kingpin quantity, but it's way beyond attempting to claim it was a ""personal use"" quantity. He cannot claim 18-19 year old naivety either. Nor was he coerced, cajoled or persuaded by someone else to mule the drugs for them. In short, all William Hayes' suffering was entirely self-inflicted by his own, conscious decisions. Although he had been re-sentenced from 4 years plus some months for possession to 30 years for smuggling, it's quite certain he would have been released within couple years after his escape. Nevertheless, Turkey was then and still is a country with harsh drug dealing and drug smuggling laws. Had the film been represented as a complete fiction, with fictional characters in a semi-fictional mid-east country, it would be much more acceptable. That wouldn't have marketed as well though.

This movie should be viewed as a complete fiction. On that basis it holds up as a very good adventure thriller, albeit with a very flawed protagonist. It utterly fails as any resemblance to the true story about William Hayes.",1432339200,2,3259,5.135593220338983

Unimaginable sadism, violence, starvation, corruption, deliberate and prolonged cruelty, repeated psychological torture and brutality personified, were consistently for 5 years, performed upon this undeserving man. You will be mute with shock and enraged at even the thought that in the 20th century, an  American citizen, a young tourist was subjected to such unwarranted creative savagery by the archaic, Turkish prison system. So much so, that upon his ingenious escape, the American government stepped in. And in valiant defense of one of it's own and in the name of human rights, exposed and forced the Turkish government to treat Americans, others from around the world and even their own who were incarcerated, with humanitarian rights and human dignity. This man exposed a brutal, foreign, dehumanizing penal system which the Turkish government sanctioned and practiced daily. Within the unsanitary, uninhabitable, jail cells of which this young man found himself a part, of. Having almost lost his sanity..., his only thread of hanging on to survival was a visit from his father, his girlfriend, an attorney and the hope of freedom. His daring escape made history and you will undoubtedly be moved to cheering with tears running down your face at this man's courageous battle for freedom and the way that he finally, obtained it. His tenacity in not giving up was not only commendable but absolutely, inspiring. This film is a magnificent portrayal of 'liberty lost and liberty found', as one man breaks through the choke hold of tyranny and the shackles of unwarranted servitude, to obtain the prize of FREEDOM!

15180,5,0767817486,"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS [1978] [Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook] [Blu-ray] Its About Never Giving Up Hope! Brilliantly Made . . . Frighteningly True!

Midnight Express is the harrowing story of Billy Hayes [Brad Davis], a young American tourist condemned to a Turkish prison for his futile attempt to smuggle hashish out of the country. A victim of ineffectual diplomacy, where Billy Hayes is made an example by a corrupt legal system. Sentenced to 30 years and must overcome some ruthless brutality and his own descent into madness in order to survive and hopefully escape.

Midnight Express is powerfully directed by Alan Parker, who inspires searing performances from Brad Davis, John Hurt and Randy Quaid. It is an unforgettable look at one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and one mans fight to get home.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Alan Parker's Midnight Express is a tough, troubling, difficult picture. It's thoroughly unpleasant to watch, loaded as it is with brutal assaults and grisly torture and people losing their minds; it also includes some cringe-inducing xenophobic attitudes and dialogue (which screenwriter Oliver Stone later apologised for). It's structurally wobbly, and full of odd interludes. But you can't deny director Alan Parker's ability to work over an audience; his direction is tight and sometimes unbearably tense, and he manages to draw us in to a story with a serious shortage of sympathetic characters, primarily through the sheer brute force of his imagery.

The film is based on the true story (reportedly much exaggerated, however) of Billy Hays [Brad Davis]. An American on vacation in Istanbul with his girlfriend Susan [Irene Miracle] in 1970, Billy Hays tries to smuggle a couple of kilos of hash back to the United States, only to get busted and sent, indefinitely, into a Turkish prison (the film single-handedly made ""Turkish prison"" synonymous with ""living hell""). With the help of his father Mr. Hayes [Mike Kellin], in a fine performance of deeply felt frustration and an expensive lawyer, he gets a three-year sentence for possession, but fifty-three days from the conclusion of that term, a higher court overturns the sentence and instead finds him guilty of smuggling for a thirty-year stint. This is around the time he starts looking to escape, and by the time that fails, he has gone a little bit crazy.

The strength of Oliver Stone's screenplay and Alan Parker's direction is in its portrayal of Billy Hayes' slow, steady descent into real madness; it's that old saw about how, if you treat a man like an animal, he'll turn into one. When Hayes makes the switch, Alan Parker is ready with a full arsenal of stylistic tricks: slow-motion photography, scary music, abstract sound, and plenty of blood and gore. But it's a slippery slope to get him there; the primary difficulty with telling this particular story is that you're asking an audience to sympathize and identify with a protagonist who is, semantics and connotations aside, a drug smuggler. And at the time he commits that crime that is literally all we know about him, Alan Parker and Oliver Stone parachute into the action at the last possible moment, beginning the film with Billy Hayes strapping the hash to his body and heading to the airport. There's no denying how unnerving the customs sequence is to watch; it's scored with heartbeat percussion and builds up some genuine tension, in spite of the fact that we know he's not going to get away with it, if he did, there'd be no film. But that speaks to the skill of Alan Parker's filmmaking; since we know nothing about this guy, we've got no good reason to want him to get away with it. In the scenes that follow, Oliver Stone's best notion for getting us on the protagonist's side seems to be making Billy Hayes into a dumb, nave kid, and letting us see how he is ruined by this corrupt, foreign, evil system (never mind that the good ol' U.S.A is not exactly renowned for the common sense proportionality of our drug sentencing).

Not long after that, Billy Hayes finds himself in court, having his sentence upped. This is one of the more troublesome scenes in the picture; his big courtroom speech, which includes some of the most obviously anti-Turkish sentiments of the film, is full of the less-than-subtle dialogue and reckless hyperbole that have been a thorn in the side of Oliver Stone's critics in the years to come. For all of its problems, however, Midnight Express is unquestionably effective. Parker seems to see it, first and foremost, as an antsy, jittery mood piece, he doesn't let a lot of sunshine in to his frames, and his handling of the story's violence is demanding and relentless. The direction is particularly compact during a nervy escape attempt; he shoots and cuts the sequence with razor sharpness, made stronger by the choice to go without music. The score itself, by Giorgio Moroder, is a mixed bag; renowned at the time for its innovative use of synthesizers, it was the first all-synth score to win an OSCAR, the dread-filled music works beautifully in the first act, but is alternately bombastic, syrupy, and button-pushy through the rest of the film. We've seen before how nothing can date a film quicker than an inappropriate score, and that's often the case here. But as you will hear from the Extras, that Vangelis was Alan Parkers preferred choice and I feel it would have been a far more of a superior music score and I think Alan Parker was rather miffed at being over ruled by the studio executives.

The performances are interesting, if not altogether successful. A young, thin Randy Quaid is a little over the top, but Paul Smith (later to play Bluto in Robert Altman's Popeye film) is a terrifying presence, and John Hurt turns in a quiet, skilful performance (he nabbed a deserved Supporting Actor nomination). Brad Davis' performance mostly works and he does the turn from in-too-deep bonehead to a slobbering mess, believably and done very smoothly. His only real fumble comes in the scene where he finds out about the change in his sentence and loses his cool; Brad Davis, at least in this film, is better in reactive mode, and he can't quite land this scene where he blusters and yells and must command the screen. But for the most part, he is a fine anchor for this graphic, vivid, forceful film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Midnight Express makes its high-definition debut with a very solid 1080p image presentation. It looks quite good, especially for a film that's thirty-plus years old; skin tones are natural, fine grain is present but not distracting, and the clean 1.85:1 image shows no scratches, dirt, or other age artefacts. Alan Parker and Cinematographer Michael Seresin work mostly in an earth colour palate, heavy on the browns, and some of the wide shots, particularly in the opening sequence, are almost sepia-toned. But within its limited saturation, the colours are rich and full and the same goes for the black levels, a considerable feat in a film this dark and a closing shot, in which Billy Hayes emerges from a dense swath of darkness, is particularly notable, as is a wonderful silhouette shot of Hurt smoking and calling out for his cat. The attention to detail is also marvellous, particularly the grime and muck of the prison walls. With no compression artefacts, edge enhancement, this is about as good a presentation as we could hope for.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Midnight Express is presented with a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD surround mix isn't quite as impressive, primarily because the picture's claustrophobic sound design doesn't present many opportunities to spread the audio throughout the soundstage. Most of the noteworthy environmental sound work comes early in the film, during an Istanbul street scene and subsequent chase. The rest of the audio is mostly geared towards the front channels, with the exception of some distributed music cues. Dialogue is mostly audible and clear; though the entire track is mixed a bit too low and I had to crank my system up much higher than usual. The disc also includes the original mono English mix, as well as a Spanish 2.0 track and French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby TrueHD surround mixes. English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, and Spanish subtitles are also offered.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Alan Parker: Alan Parker delivers a cogent talk in which he reminisces about the production. There is some repetition of content with the booklet essay, but he attempts to focus here more on the production logistics, his directorial choices, and his desire for ""authenticity."" In both the essay and the commentary, Alan Parker is very frank about his difficult working relationship with Oliver Stone.

Special Feature: The Producers [26:00] Part One of the documentary features interviews with producers Peter Guber and David Puttnam. They cover the genesis of the project, the hiring of Stone, the casting and the studio wanted Richard Gere; Dennis Quaid was also in the running, and working off the studio radar with a low budget.

Special Feature: The Production [25:00] Oliver Stone describes writing with a sense of anger and urgency. Alan Parker explains how he got attached to the project, scouting locations, shooting in Malta, and working with John Hurt.

Special Feature: The Finished Film [24:00] More stories about Brad Davis's eccentricity, the decision to avoid subtitling the foreign dialogue, the photography, the score, and the movie's controversial reception at Cannes.

Special Feature: The Making of Midnight Express [1978] [7:27] A grainy, wonderful vintage full-frame behind-the-scenes piece and its on-screen title is ""I'm Healthy, I'm Alive, and I'm Free."" The heavy-handed voice-over introduces us to the real Billy Hayes as he roams the streets of New York, before showing us clips from the film and on-set interviews with Billy Hayes and Peter Guber, plus a New York interview with Billy Hayes' father.

Special Feature: Photo Gallery [13:00] It includes a few shots from the set, but mostly presents images from the film.

Theatrical Trailers: Several SONY Blu-ray titles, we get clips for The Da Vinci Code, A River Runs Through It, Not Easily Broken, Obsessed, Casino Royale and Damages Season One though, unfortunately, the Trailer for Midnight Express isn't one of them, round out the bonus features.

BONUS: Booklet Essay: Part of the fancy packaging is a 32-page booklet with many glossy photos, storyboard sketches, and an in-depth essay by director Alan Parker about his experiences making the film. The essay is so thorough, in fact, that it covers pretty much all of the information repeated in the documentary on the Blu-ray disc.

Finally, superbly crafted and emotionally involving, Midnight Express often defeats the moral quagmire as presented in the film and the controversial aspects of its script through sheer film making brilliance. Managing to turn a drug-smuggling character into a sympathetic figure due to his disdainful treatment in a hellish foreign prison and taking liberties with a true story for dramatic and artistic. Midnight Express certainly deserves the accolades bestowed upon it at the Academy Awards despite the subject matter and controversial depiction thereof makes it a rather unique film in the annals of cinema. No matter one's take on this representation of Billy Hayes' story, there is no denying the artistic merits Midnight Express brings to the table, its superb technical achievements reason alone to watch. SONY's Blu-ray release of Midnight Express befits the film and there is plenty of bonus materials information with this brilliant beautiful ""DigiBook"" and that is why it has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. 30 years after its release, Midnight Express continues to impress. However harrowing and unpleasant, the film delivers a strong sense of dynamic verisimilitude [meaning the appearance of being true or real] and creates a good look at a miserable situation. The Blu-ray offers better than expected picture, acceptable but dated audio, and a few nice extras; the audio commentary proves particularly enjoyable and ever since I viewed this film, it has always burned an amazing image of viewing a great directed film, that deserved all the awards it garnered and on top of all that it also a very character driven film with a stunning script and now it has gone pride of place in my Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

15251,4,0767817486,"This movie is great.  The acting is good, the plot is intense, and the directing is well-done.  In fact, I would have given it a five- star rating, had I not read the book.

I did this backwards.  I first read Midnight Returns (reviewed on 11-14-12, which is the follow-up book to Midnight Express, which is the story of a man who escapes from the brutality of a Turkish prison.  Having been sufficiently impressed, I bought the original book, and once again I was so moved I purchased the movie.

Unlike the book, the movie is unclear in a lot of places, but most of that is irrelevant, since the basic idea is there-- there is no such thing as human rights and justice in that foreign prison, and every man is at the mercy of the whims of his jailer.  So in that regard, it was engrossing, and  it was nominated for six Academy Awards in 1978, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay.  And that's baffling to me, because it's that very thing that disappointed me.

I understand that movies based on true stories often change some details to make for a smoother presentation, but this one went too far.  My basic gripe was with the ending.  Spoiler Alert:  I'm going to compare the two endings, so further reading of this will ruin any suspense as to the final outcome.  On the other hand,  most readers probably already know that in the end, Billy triumphs and escapes.  That's what made this movie such an inspirational hit several decades ago.  But it's the details of that escape that diverged so far from the truth , it ruined the very heart of the story.

In the movie, there is an accident of Fate, and Billy takes advantage of the situation and waltzes out of the prison in broad daylight.  What a lucky break!  The truth is completely different.  Billy carefully plots, studying various avenues of escape, inspecting places to hide, observing the prison routine, and working his body to build up stamina for the Big Day.  After several years, he then makes his move, hiding in a large container, then swimming quietly to a small dinghy, rowing that boat in terrifying seas, nearly succumbing to total exhaustion.  He finally makes landfall, then moves surreptitiously toward the Greek border, all the while looking frantically over his shoulder, knowing there is an APB on him.  The first part of the book is frightening in that it shows the futility of his situation, but the last few chapters are an edge-of-your-seat thriller  because, in contrast, it offers  that  wonderful thing called Hope.  You know the odds of success are not good, and you know the consequences are horrific if he fails.  Billy does a great job of conveying this terror in his narrative, and I found myself drawn in, hardly daring to breathe, lest his enemies hear me.  What a shame to eliminate this rich and gripping ordeal from the movie.

This change from fact to fantasy  not only robs us, the viewer, but it cheats Billy as well.  His escape was not a stroke of luck;  it was a testament to the courage, patience, endurance and single-minded focus of this heroic man.  In the end, it was  guts and perseverance that set Billy free.

Having said all that, I would still recommend the movie.  It's a good story -but the book is better.",1353888000,4,3222,4.587719298245614

15255,3,0767817486,". . . years ago as a VHS rental and I had caught some of it here and there on cable television over the years.  I remember really liking this film when I saw it as a younger man.  It was supposedly cutting edge and ""gritty"" with a ""based on a true story"" aspect to it.  However- the major emotion upon seeing this film in its entirety a second time years later- was one of embarrassment.

The main character, Billy Hayes, along with the rest of the Westerners come off as nauseating egotists that I found myself having a hard time feeling much sympathy for.  The court room speech Billy Hayes delivers at his sentencing is so over the top that it is laughable.  And a later scene when his girl friend comes to visit is moronically uncomfortable to watch. And the film is quite dated.  Frankly- compared to just about any US prison- the Turkish prison presented in that film looks downright comfy and cozy with an anarchic freedom on the inside that one would never see in just about any antiseptic rigidly controlled US slam.

That being said the film is shot well and the story is capably told.  It just doesn't stand up to the test of time very well.  I'd recommend it to someone who hadn't seen it- but with heavy caveats.",1347321600,,1225,4.380530973451328
15256,5,0767817486,"First of all - WHAT A GREAT MOVIE.  I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and was utterly floored.  It actually gave me nightmares, which I'm sure was the intention.  It's remained one of my favorite films since then; although I rarely watch it because of its intensity, I've always held it in very high regard.  The script, the direction, the acting, the production values - everyhing just magnificent.  (And I also have a soft spot for Giorgio Moroder's Super70's synth score.)

Now about those criticisms...

I've never understood the charges of xenophobia leveled at this film.  It's a story told from the point of view of Billy Hayes, a young man sentenced to years in a foreign prison, with no friends or help in the country where his (foolish) actions have trapped him.  OF COURSE he's going to see the people abusing him as horrible monsters - wouldn't you?  And really, the only people I saw that were portrayed as ""evil"" were the big horrible prison guard played by Paul Smith, the hard-line prosecuting attorney, and the rather oily defense attorney who really does seem to be trying to help.  So there ARE no horrible abusive prison guards in reality?  There ARE no hard-line prosecutors who are more interested in coups than justice?  Defense attorneys are NEVER the least bit sleazy?  Seems to me the only reason these characters are deemed ""racist"" is that it's apparently a sin to portray anyone outside America as being other than nice - as if there were no ugly, mean, selfish, violent people anywhere else in the world.  Sorry, that's dishonest.  Bad people exist everywhere, and it's purely self-serving to insist that filmmakers must never allow such people into their films, ESPECIALLY when those characters are based on REAL people in the original book!

As to the differences in the plot, are you kidding?  Do these critics have any idea how horribly mangled a book can get when it falls into the hands of Hollywood producers?  I give this film credit for letting Billy stay male instead of being made into a woman to make him more ""vulnerable"", or getting arrested in Aruba instead of Turkey because it's more photogenic.  And hey, kudos to the filmmakers for wanting to use the story to try and fight a horrible injustice, since that's one of the reasons Hayes wrote the book in the first place!

Re: the DVD - VERY good.  The best edition so far.  A director's commentary, numerous interviews, and a beautiful photo gallery.  I only wish there were a retrospective ""making of"" feature, but as Stephen Wright says, you can't have everything - where would you put it?

(WHEN is Amazon going to start listing the extras on DVD's??  I keep having to go elsewhere to find out what's on a disc, and often end up buying it where I can find the info.  GET ON THIS, AMAZON.)",1334966400,,2802,4.66530612244898
15257,5,0767817486,"Based on a true story, the 1978 film ""Midnight Express"" stars Brad Davis as Billy Hayes, a young American who is apprehended while attempting to smuggle two kilos of hashish out of Turkey in the early 1970s.

Despite his hopes of an early release, Billy is convicted and spends years in a hellish Turkish prison.  When they realize their sentences will stretch on for many more years, Billy and fellow inmates Jimmy (Randy Quaid) and Max (John Hurt) plot escape when they face sadistic guards and an environment so brutal that the law of the jungle prevails and many of the prisoners are driven insane.  A couple of the scenes are absolutely not for the faint of heart, and I can now understand why I was not allowed to watch the film on cable when I was nine years old.

""Midnight Express"" is a Seventies classic--it was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two, and its soundtrack produced a Top 40 hit, Giorgio Moroder's ""Chase.""  The DVD set for this unforgettable film comes with a booklet that discusses the production of the movie, and the DVD itself contains the original preview of the film.

15281,5,0767817486,"This is based upon a real life story! It's been featured on National Geographic's show called=Locked up Abroad!

  In the 70's while boarding an international flight out of Istanbul Airport. A young american named BILLY HAYES is caught attempting to smuggle 2 kilos of hashish out of the country. The drugs were strapped to his body.
Uh-Oh things didn't work out like he planned. While his girlfriend that was with him managed to get on the plane. He got nailed & the story will have you glued from there on.
 He is taken into custody to the powers to be. They laugh & belittle him while stripping him naked{nice tush shot}*For the female fans.

 He is told that he will be released if he cooperates with the authorities in identifying the person who actually sold him the hash. He didn't sell out!
  Billy tries to makes a run for it & is recaptured. He is initially sentenced to serve just over 4 years for possession. With no time for the more harsh crime of smuggling drugs.

 The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense. The prison warden is one mean sadistic animal & he dishes out the worse physical torture as well as mental abuse.
 The other inmates that had been there for a while were zombies from the torture they had been exposed to. You will be surprised @ one of the americans he makes friends with who is still known in hollywood today.
  I saw this movie when it came out on the big screen. I had a huge crush on BRAD DAVIS who sadly died from something close of the content of this movies plot. He did fabulous job & he also starred in SYBIL.It starred Sally Field with JO Anne Woodward.

  This was a gripping story of the real deal{THEN}if you get into trouble transporting drugs overseas. The turkish prison had hellish conditions that unto itself would make any one crazy.
I won't spoil the story line{u have to see it for your self}billy i order to survive had too dig deep into the pit of human strength to grab every oz of fight it took to survive the hot mess he got into. There is a breaking point that had producers in limbo & they walked off set. Billy lost it a few times but that time was a bit vivid be prepared.{BLOODY}
  The movie was based upon BILLY HAYES real life experience who was featured in the highlights in the main menu on the dvd i have & i recently saw his story on Nat/Geo's show called locked up abroad~His account was pretty much close to the same but hollywood amped it up a bit.

 Ive never forgotten this movie!#1 I adored Brad Davis his death was ironic in lue of the subject matter of this film years later. A shame because he had looks & talent. When i watch this movie now i think how sad that he lived a part in this movie that was ultimately his demise in his real life & death.

 It's a poignant look into the world of drug smuggling on an individual level no cartels or glamorized drug rings. He was young it was the 70's sad to say ""everybody was doing it"" here or there. He jus had the foolish guts to do it & it was something he paid for 10 fold.

You are not an American w/freedom if you make those types of choices in a country less than the diplomacy we have in U.S.A.
 The sadistic prison warden i think was harder on him because he was strong fought back & was american. Unlike the native captives under his rule who seemed use to his abuse.
 It was a matter of making an example out of him power trip per say Billy wasn't the only one that got the henoius physical abuse. From the distain the prison warden who i felt like had hatred any way but focused alot more on americans. The famliy notion in the film as touching as his father tried.

It made me think because these things have & do happen to our fellow americans like P.O.W's,Radicals that kidnapp people for political reasons for ransom/& drug smuggling that still happens today.

 A stunning performance by Brad Davis & his determination along with the struggle within was as good as it gets. He had to fight or fall down & live in the hell he put upon himself! It has a well deserved ending & he lived to tell his story & this movie was about his experience.

Be warned: it will make you feel helpless. And hopeless. You may not like the freedom you enjoy anymore. Or perhaps you will cherish it as a gift: each day, every day.

""Midnight Express"" is not a common tale of heroism and Hollywood stunts. Neither is it about a new age youth that believed more in freedom from responsibility than freedom of the ideals. It starts from a quick adventurous act, but slowly starts to taint your values and respect for humanity. In a way it's a good lesson for those who think the world is their playground just because they were fortunate enough to be born to luxury and vanity.

What starts as apathy for a stupid act soon becomes a battle for human rights and freedom. This movie reminds you that you really cannot get away with any wrong deed. More in some places than others, but you will pay the price. Although in all fairness, Brad Davis was exquisite in his portrayal of the strong will and courage of Billy Hayes (did I mention it is based on a true story?:-).

I rate this move 4.8/5.0. It's pungent. But it's a bomb at that.

15287,5,0767817486,"This film is a manifesto in many ways and will remain a classic. A manifesto against drug trafficking. This activity is absurd, silly, only dictated by greed at all levels for something that has no justification whatsoever.

And yet the real cause of the drama is in the tolerance some - like the father or the girl friend - have in front of the moderate use of such substances. But it is also a manifesto against the only answer that is leveled at that problem, in this case in Turkey, but it is not better anywhere else as for that, and that is repression.

Repression makes the activity dangerous, hence all the more attractive because it becomes pure sports. What's more it is a manifesto against the cruelty of the punishment. The only objective of it is to make the person suffer physically first of all and to enjoy the slow and brutal degradation of the person. It also creates a social microcosm among prisoners that aims at developing fear and hatred.

At the same time the surrounding microcosm of the prison wardens is a descent into a sadistic hellish cloaca that cannot in any way be redeemed. It is finally a manifesto against justice, and not only Turkish justice. The representative of the US consulate, or the lawyers, local or not, are not better.

At the end we just wonder what we could do to really avoid the sadistic spiral of that vengeful vision of social management. And the only answer seems to be ""escape"". As far away and as fast as possible from justice, prisons, drugs and all the rest, maybe even humanity itself.

The 1978 film ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" was a film that was known for its controversial story but also seen as a film masterpiece as it was the first major film to depict foreigners inhumane treatment in prison and it was brought alive due to the awesome performance by actor Brad Davis (""Chariots of Fire"", ""Roots"") and a film directed by Alan Parker (""Bugsy Malone"", ""Pink Floyd the Wall"", ""Fame"", ""Evita"" and ""Angela's Ashes"") and a screenplay by Oliver Stone (""Platoon"", ""JFK"", ""Natural Born Killers"", ""The Doors"" and ""Alexander"").  The film would also feature the talents of composer Giorgio Moroder (""Flashdance"", ""Scarface"" and ""Over the Top"") and cinematography by Michael Seresin (""Fame"", ""Angela's Ashes"", ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Step Up"").

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" would be nominated for seven Academy Awards and won an Academy Award for ""Best Music"", ""Original Score"", ""Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium"".

But what caught attention was that the film was based on a true story of Billy Hayes who was convicted for smuggling hash and sentenced to four years in a Turk prison where he and many people were tortured.  To make matters worse, he became a scapegoat to prevent foreigners from even thinking of smuggling drugs in the country by having his sentenced overturned and giving him a life sentence.

Hayes book ""Midnight Express"" details his life behind bars and the inhumane treatment that he and others received in prison and eventually how he escaped from the prison.  The film adaption had gone through so many hands through its screenplay adaption and studio pressure that in order to make it a commercial film and due to budget constraints and location challenges, there is a difference between the book and the actual film.

But despite the controversy (which Oliver Stone and even the real Billy Hayes have regretted the film's depiction of the Turks), the film was well-known for its powerful performances and its powerful storyline.  It's a gritty film that shows the violence behind Hayes experiences at the prison and torture they received.  Including other things that were deemed quite controversial back in the late 70's.

It is important to note that this film is featured in Digibook format (a book format and not the standard blue blu-ray case) as it contains a 42-page booklet with Director Alan Parker writing a personal memoir titled ""Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express"" is included.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" received its 30th Anniversary treatment back in 2008 and in 2009, gets its High Definition treatment as the film is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:85:1).

The film looks incredible on Blu-ray and also compared to its DVD counterpart, the film really shows off the detail and grittiness of the prison and also how bad the conditions were (note: this is one of the controversies as the actual prison was supposedly created in the 1960's but the film makes the prison look like the prison was created many decades before).  But the picture quality captures the grittiness of the prisoners and the overall look, is not exactly vibrant but quite detailed.

The film looks as if there was little DNR (digital noise reduction) was used and overall, you can see grain on the film.  Overall, this is a superb transfer to Blu-ray and another classic film given awesome treatment from Sony.

As for the audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1. (Also in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and the original English mono soundtrack).  For the most part, the film is front channel heavy as it is dialog-driven.  Although there are action sequences, they are very few and if anything comes alive is the music by Giorgio Moroder.

Overall, its great to see the film receive a lossless soundtrack and also include the original mono soundtrack as well.  But you are able to hear the screams of the prisoners while being tortured and overall, the pain and anguish from the talents who just are trying to keep sane in the prison.

As for subtitles, subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" comes with several special features featured in High Definition and Standard Definition in English (Stereo) and Portuguese and Spanish subtitles.  The Blu-ray is BD-Live enabled.

  * ""Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express"" by Director Alan Parker - As mentioned, the release is featured in digibook format and includes a 42-page booklet/personal memoir titled ""Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express"" by Director Alan Parker.  This book is quite thorough in the challenges the film had and also, how Brad Davis was a method actor and in essence became Billy Hayes.  Also, how warden Hamidou (Paul L. Smith) was also a bit rough on the actors during the torture scenes to the dismay of the actors who were to pretend as if they were being beaten (and too get that realism, Smith didn't hold back).  Also, how John Hurt (who played Max) didn't shower for six weeks in order to make his scene seem real and natural.  The personal memoir is quite detailed and those who enjoyed the film will enjoy reading this book filled with photos and storyboard sketches.
  * Commentary with Director Alan Parker - If you thought the booklet was full of detail, Director Alan Parker really goes into detail of each scene and what transpired behind-the-scenes of the making of ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"".
  * The Making of Midnight Express (7:27) The original 1978 featurette with an interview with the real Billy Hayes.
  * The Producers - (25:54) Peter Guber (Executive Producer), Producer David Puttnam and Director Alan Parker discuss the challenge of making the film and the changes that had to be made for the film.
  * The Production - (24:27) Interviews with Director Alan Parker, Producer Alan Marshall and Billy Hayes.  Continuing discussion of the challenges of making the film, which included the studio execs not thrilled of the producers selecting Brad Davis (Richard Gere pulled out of the film) and tried to say he was cross-eyed and thus the producers having to get a medical note that he wasn't cross-eyed and challenges of finding the location and the differences that went into making the film from the original screenplay.
  * The Finished Film - (23:49) Discussion of how hardcore of a method actor Brad Davis was and how far Alan Parker pushed him to achieve that powerful performance of Billy Hayes.  Also, discussing how the film is based on a true story but is not the true story.  And how there are key differences between the film and the book. Featuring interviews with Director Alan Parker and Oliver Stone.
  * Photo Gallery - (12:35) A photo gallery which is accompanied by music from the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" is a powerful film about survival and despite how far low one can be in a situation, the human will to live and survive can lead to amazing wonders.  As it has had in the real life situation for Billy Hayes who had one of the most impressive prison escapes.

If there was any negative of the film, it's that the real story of Billy Hayes and his life in prison has been changed for the film adaption.  In fact, Billy Hayes has commented in regards to the film that he wished there were more positive portrayals of the Turks and even Oliver Stone has come out and talked about their wish that the film had shown a positive life on some Turks and that not all Turks are bad.

But also, the actual escape of Billy Hayes differs greatly from the film adaption.  But considering that there was another planned final for the film that would have been a bit unbelievable, I was content with how the film ended.

The film is ultimately a powerful film and the acting is top notch and Brad Davis just shined in this film.  He was incredible playing the part of Billy Hayes and it was a role that consumed him even when near the end of the filming of ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"".  But his performance made ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" so believable in that despite what he did to receive prison time, we sympathize with him when he is tortured and is told that his four year sentence has been overturned and he would be getting a life sentence.

It was indeed a powerful performance and a powerful film experience that is so visually disturbing and that Director Alan Parker and crew were able to capture the anguish, the anger, the pain and grittiness of the film was amazing.

Overall, ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" is an amazing film and worthy of having in your collection.  But I can understand if the film may be a bit much for some to watch it for a second time or more.

But for those who did enjoy the film, this Blu-ray release of ""MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"" is the definitive version to own!",1248134400,47,8853,4.818663136995367
15312,5,0767817486,"""Midnight Express"" was nominated for 7 Academy Awards in 1978, winning for Best Music, Best Original Score, and Best Writing for Material Adapted From Another Medium for Oliver Stone. Brad Davis stars as Billy Hayes in this true story of a young man who is arrested in Instanbul, Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. What follows are five harrowing, hellish years for Billy as he tries to survive living in a foreign prison, in a country he knows little about, and with people who seem at times unhuman. Billy ultimately has a nervous breakdown and he is sentenced to time in the psychiatric unit of the prison.
 In the late 1990's both Oliver Stone and Billy Hayes stated they were sorry for the film's depiction of Turkish people, as not a single Turk was dramaitized as compassionate. The film has gone on to be hated by the people of Turkey for it's narrow-minded view on a foreign country and its people. Nevertheless, ""Midnight Express"" is an excellent film, one you will watch time and time again for its graphic depiction of prison life and the attempts of those who are imprisoned in trying to survive. ""Midnight Express"" is prison slang for inmates who want to attempt escaping, thus that is where the title is derived from.
 The movie has an excellent cast including Bo Hopkins, Randy Quaid, and John Hurt. Brad Davis is mesmerizing as the young Billy and he should have received an Oscar nod for Best Actor but was overlooked. Maureen McCormick from TV's ""The Brady Bunch"" was considered for the small part of Billy's girlfriend, but the role was cast with another actress.
 This new anniversary edition of ""Midnight Express"" includes the film in widescreen format, which is beautifully restored, a director's commentary by Alan Parker, photo gallery, and a producer's featurette. Brad Davis' widow has written a fascinating book on Brad called ""After Midnight"" which features some great information on the movie. This book came out after Brad died of assisted suicide in 1991. Brad Davis was diagnosed with AIDS.
 If you enjoy this movie three other prison films are worth watching: ""Ecsape from Alcatraz"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""The Green Mile"" are near the caliber of ""Midnight Express"".",1243900800,3,2232,4.912466843501326
15313,5,0767817486,"A young american man in on vacation in Istanbul, Turkey.  He has idea to smuggle 4 kilos of hashish and sell it to his friends in US.  Before even boarding the plane, he is caught smuggling drugs and taken to Turkish prison.  It all goes downhill from there.

One month before completing his 4 year prison sentence, he is called into a court where it is announced by a judge that his sentence is extended to life in prison.  Without anything to loose, he creates bond with other westerners in prison in attempt to escape.  Depictions of torture, humiliation, emotional infliction of pain are so breathtaking that main character's descent into a rage is a natural progression of the conditions he is forced to live in.

15330,4,0767817486,"I apologize in advance this isn't really a review of the movie.  I just can't believe how frequently older reviews say alarming things, and I had to speak up.  Things like:

- the ""spoiled"" guy got what he deserved
- that may have been the way things were in the Turkish penal system of the '70s, but we must abide by their ways; ""when in Rome"" as it were
- jokes about the abuse

These types of comments weren't rare, and I found it disturbing.  With so many people out there possessing that attitude, no wonder human rights abuses are allowed to go on in our world.  And will continue until everyone takes the issue seriously and never makes excuses for it.

Also whether or not the story is completely accurate or not, I'm amazed by all the reviewers who declared the whole thing was a complete lie, because ""I've been to Turkey and people weren't like that.""  I've yet to read a review by someone who said, ""I served time in a Turkish prison and it was not like that at all.""  No, these reviewers are people who simply don't like what they they are seeing/hearing, therefore they unequivocally pronounce that everything in the story was a racist fabrication.  Really?

15331,3,0767817486,"Based on the true story of would-be drug smuggler Willaim Hayes, screenwriter Oliver Stone goes way over the top here with courtroom theatrics, sensational violence, and an overt chauvanism towards Turks in this portrayal of the Turkish prison system as a kind of hell on earth. On the plus side: great locations (Instanbul and Malta), beautiful photography, and good acting, help create a sense of atmosphere.",1228521600,3,410,5.2272727272727275
15332,1,0767817486,"Stone won't make himself vulnerable to anyone or the facts, whether that means eliminating all JFK conspiracy theories other than his own or simplifying a story and people as he has done here in Midnight Express. Stone borrowed Billy Hayes' real story of being held in a Turkish prison for several years after being caught smuggling hashish, and hijacked it to devastating effect. [I focus on screenwriter Stone instead of director Parker because the substance of Hayes' original book was altered by Stone and Parker just created Stone's skewed vision]. Stone was successful in destroying the Turkish justice image in the minds of generations of Americans. Ask most any American [now thirty years after Stone made his movie] to picture a Turkish(or Islamic) prison or court room or justice system, and the one portrayed in Midnight Express is the one that is ingrained. Coincidence or not, it should be noted that this humiliating portrayal of Islamic justice came at a time of increased Hollywood output of negative Islamic images and favorable Israeli ones(the unprecedented and universally viewed miniseries Masada). To this day, Islam's portrayal in movies is considered horrendous by those who study it(Shaheen's 'Reel Bad Arabs').

Instead of having ANY sympathetic Muslim/Turkish characters, they ALL are beasts. It turns out the real Billy Hayes actually made friends with several Turkish inmates but accepting Stone's reality means accepting this truth as a lie. Constantly the Western inmates have more depth,..they play instruments, they sing, they constantly visibly show compassion that the Muslims lack, they even articulate in a courtroom why Western justice culture is superior to Islamic sense of justice. The Muslims in the film are stoic, opportunistic, hypocritical, and, well,..evil. They are portrayed as victims of their own culture, as the judge hangs his head down when Billy is castigating Islamic justice for its lack of mercy, and the judge seems sad when he replies that his hands are tied. There is no reaction or inquisitiveness in the faces of the Turkish prosecutor or the others - the viewer sees them as programmed by their culture. Just so the viewer isn't confused as to the root of what creates such a fiasco of justice, Stone purposefully puts Islamic prayer beads in the hands of reprehensible characters like the Turkish public defender, and makes sure that a mosque is the prominent structure occupying the frame as Billy is driven around the city by policemen. Likewise, he hangs Christian symbols on the victims in the film. The warden never attempted to rape Hayes, as the film depicts, nor did Hayes murder anyone. The raping warden, with his piggish obese kids, is a metaphor for the appetite and stern lack of fidelity/tolerance that Stone seems to want to broadcast about Islam to the viewer. Stone's manufactured murder of the raping warden may have been an effort to implant the idea that the resolution the [mostly Christian] viewers should expect between their culture and the grotesque monster of Islam will take the form of a violent showdown.  The viewer can't help but feel relief at the death of the warden, and then carries away from the movie farmer Stone's seed of predjudice against Islam.

The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a ""true story"" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims. Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: ""The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs."" and, ""I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'""",1205625600,25,3915,5.029275808936826
15333,5,0767817486,"""Midnight Express"" is a true story of a 20 year old American Billy Hayes, who tried to smuggle two kilograms of hashish out of Turkey.  Billy got searched at the Istanbul Airport, and the Turkish police arrested Billy.  In return for cooperation the police offered leniency, which Billy accepted.  Unfortunately, Billy tried to escape while cooperating with local authorities.  Billy now has to face the wrath of the Turkish justice system, which mainly wants to make an example out of foreigners, especially Americans used to getting away with Billy's behavior back in the States.

""Midnight Express"" was an instant classic as soon as it was released in 1978.  Little was known about Muslim countries and levels of freedom, if any.  This film showed just the amount of freedom people in a westernized Muslim country received.  Istanbul is both in Europe and Asia, a large, cosmopolitan city, so it's that more of a shock to encounter a prison like the one Billy ended in in this beautiful city.

Thirty years later, even with the current state-of-the-art films, ""Midnight Express"" still has the same effect.  Some movies are just made to last, and this is definitely one of them.  Movie music has definitely changed since 1978 (and I am glad that it has), but otherwise this film shows us there can still be low budget films that endure the test of time.  Highly recommended.",1203465600,4,1376,4.883620689655173
15334,4,0767817486,"Midnight Express - coming out in '78 - gave us a cinematic view into the Middle East that the three-network evening news at the time didn't provide. The clash of cultures and values in this movie really stood in contrast to the ""malaise"" period in America (as Jimmy Carter put it). The film became more relevant when it was on television a few years later during the Iranian hostage crisis, with the clash of cultures playing out in real life. The idea of hell being a ""Turkish prison"" was popularized with this movie. Also the idea that America's post 60's values had become trivial compared to a world much older than it's just celebrated bicentennial. I think Alan Parker really made his mark with his direction of this movie. I followed many of his later efforts on the strength of this film. It's both brutally real and hallucinatory at the same time. There's a feeling of relief at the end of this movie like no other ""prison escape"" movie. The film is also notable as being one of Oliver Stone's early efforts as a screenwriter. This new dvd effort should improve on the 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, which came out in the ""early authored"" dvd days of 1998. There are few more extras on this edition so it's a worthy upgrade and a definite must have if one is looking for a film that's an insight to the time, the cultures and even some perspective on where we are now.",1201996800,6,1372,4.514056224899599
15335,4,0767817486,"Midnight Express is the 1978 film adaptation to the autobiographical book by Billy Hayes. The book and film tell of Hayes' attempt to smuggle drugs out of Turkey through an airplane flight.

I first saw this film a long time ago in a health class shown to the class as part of a drug lesson. I have always been a big fan of ""Based on true stories films"" so I saw this with an opened mind. I didn't expect it, however, to be this good!

Brad Davis' portrayal of Billy Hayes is one to be remembered. The script is written by Oliver Stone and Alan Parker's directing is excellent. However my only complaint is the fact that the film seems to have a few  differences from the book that are either left out or replaced by something fictional.

I really recommend reading the book as it is an actual account of what happened to Hayes but I recommend also watching the film purely to see great film-making. The book I recommend for those who want to get an actual knowledge of what really happened.

15361,4,0767817486,"Saw this a long time ago and it struck me as a 70's liberal film. (it's always easier to be outraged when the oppressor is a one dimensional third world ogre).

The one part of the film I thought was most thought provoking was William

Haye's statement after he found that he had been sentenced to thirty- rather- than 3 years. The arguement went something like this: crime is only a question of the will of the majority- there are no absolute categories of right and wrong. What is and is not criminal changes from time to time based on popular opinion. The people who administer this so called justice are- in classic sixties and seventies finger pointing- no better than pigs.

The implications of this thought are manifold: had Oliver- who I admire-

stumbled on some good acid; is justice, as in the thought of Michel Foucault- a function of historical power forces; should everything, as in DeSade, be permitted. Is there such a thing as ""victiomless crimes?"" And

most importantly, is there any objective standard of right and wrong or,

in a Nietzchean sense, good an evil.

If we apply this logic to the ""detainees at guantanomo bay,"" they seem much less guilty than Billy Hayes. Also why are all the Turks portayed

as weasals, pedarasts, and, generally subhuman. Billy's impassioned plea about the blatant unfairness of his sentence extence cannot erase the stench of half a millenium of eurocentric cultural and political imperialism. For his time (at the time of this film) Jimmy Carter was a

great humanitarian and inspirational leader who was born to early or late to be fully appreciated.

I don't have have an answer but perhaps this may begin productive dialogue

in our increasingly mindless culture. One thing to be sure, Billy Hayes,

in spite of his trangressions, is still representative of the dark side

of cowboy capatilism and the American dream. Nevertheless, his ""postmodern"" arguement of moral relativism is still with us today.",1169942400,2,1959,4.882175226586103

In a prison of desolation, he refuses to accept one captive's advances; he steals an informer's money for revenge; and gives a harsh lesson in brutality on one oppressor...

Paul Smith plays beautifully the brutal and sadistic head-guard... Being of nature cruel and heartless, this bald man is vindictive and indifferent to the truth... He is cruel, vicious, unjust, and verbally abusive...

The Turkish prison is seen as an environment so dirty, horrific and inhuman, clouded by rape, beatings, stress and punishment... Parker permits the cruel prison guards--characterized by their aggressive, cynical, and inflexible behavior--to speak in Turkish since this situation can easily create hopelessness, frustration, hatred and despair...",1168128000,3,1361,5.587378640776699
15363,3,0767817486,"I am a Turkish citizen with a great love of cinema.  I myself am an amateur film maker.  Like many of my Turkish friends, I liked this movie as a film production.  All the good film making elements had their good ways into this cult film, such as strong performances, cinematography, music, etc.  However, what I find unforgivable for such great film makers, like Alan Parker, Oliver Stone, David Putnam is the fact that they have been a part of a great propoganda for anti-Turkish view.  I don't believe that such avid film makers of Hollywood circle would naively didn't realise this attempt.  It is so obvious that some rich lobbies funded this film as a sheer anti-Turkish propoganda, and very successfully used such names.  This, in my view, is a black stain on all.  I would have respected it highly if they were to use both side's view on the film, and remain totally unbiased to the matter.  For once, there is no Turkish player in the film, not even a decent dubbing artists, who would have eliminated those highly visible broken Turkish accents of non-Turkish actors or dubbers.

The film starts portraying a very negative side of Turkey, showing some crude elements of Istanbul, as if Istanbul is a harsh and unforgiving Islamic town from mid ages.  Then the film moves into the tragic story of Bill Hayes, who got caught smuggling hashish or some kind of drug, which I don't know, because I never dealt with them.  The movie is full of terrible torturing scenes of a so-called Turkish prison, totally created from the twisted memories of Hayes in Malta.  I never have been prisoned, so I have no way of knowing how true was the Turkish prisons at that time.  I bet that they were not much different than of those in Greece, or US, or even from UK.  The actors playing the so-called Turkish figures, like lawyer, judge, attorney, spoke a very very broken Turkish language, full of spoken grammer mistakes.  Even the sets were created with a fanaticly anti-Turk view.  The scene where he curses to the entire Turkish nation, calling them and their mother all as ""pigs"" should be the creations of an angry anti-Turk than an acclaimed writer like Stone.  The film would probably look much nicer without such ultra-fanatic scenes.

The real story of the film was that Bill Hayes was helped for his escape by an officer in American consulate, who was an old lady, working at the Istanbul consulate.  I met her when I was working at the consulate during my college years in mid 80s.  She constructed (probably a well planned strategy with the helps of some political powers) a plan, by which Hayes was taken by the official boat of American consulate (known as Hiawatha) from the semi-open prison at one of the islands of Istanbul, and taken to Greece, and then to US.  Even at this account, Hayes was given a sort of privilidge at his stay in the prison to stay at one of the relatively comfortable prisons of Istanbul.

As I said, I liked the film, as a movie, but, I would still criticise the film makers by being tools for such propoganda makers.  Oliver Stone himself came to Turkey recently and apologised for his mistake.  So, apart from this huge shame on the filmmakers' side, there is one scene, which is probably the closest to the most reality. That was the scene, where Hayes was going thru the security of the airport, and the acting of the policemen was just great.  Apart from these, if you keep this reality in mind while watching, the rest is a very nice film on screen, not a close reality of what you would see in Istanbul.  Oh, by the way, don't mess with any kind of drugs anyways.  You might get into some kind of trouble for fact.  And, for a bit of advice, don't mess with the Turkish police.  You might get into their bad side for once, and......",1166227200,6,3777,4.560830860534125

People suspect of terrorism may due to the actions and regulations of the Bush government face a similar degree of dehumanization. This movie demonstrates the consequences if we allow governments to act as they want, freely and without controll. This concerns both George W. Bush as well as the former Turkey government.

But after they've already changed and twisted every significant event in it anyway, why didn't they just say it took place in the mythical country of Xenophobia, instead of going ahead and viciously maligning an entire nation of the kindest, friendliest, most hospitable people on Earth?

The one TRUE fact is that Billy Hayes was a convicted drug smuggler who got caught red-handed. (Apparently the film-makers think that Hayes being a well-heeled American should entitle him to special exemptions from the law.)  Everything else is a lie.  The girlfriend?  Didn't exist!  The climactic (and inexcusable) ""nation of pigs"" speech?  Never happened!  Our macho ""hero"" firmly rejecting the advances of the blond guy?  Read the book -- Billy Hayes himself says that sometimes they made love.  Even the biting off tongue and escaping scene at the end is nothing like what really happened.  Virtually every detail of it was false, even the location.

Billy Hayes was never raped in the Turkish prison -- but if the real Billy took those blond curls of his into an AMERICAN prison, I'll bet he sure would have been.  He'd never be able to walk again.

I find it utterly contemptible that the film-makers rounded up a cast of ARMENIANS and GREEKS to play Turks as being a bunch of hideously sadistic goons.  Were they really that ignorant of history?  Not to mention that the worst and most brutal one was played by the very American Paul Smith.  There wasn't a real Turk in the pack.

Oliver Stone apologized to the Turkish people when he finally visited Turkey, and he was kindly forgiven -- but I sure wouldn't have let him off so easily.  His self-serving ""apology"" was far too little, and far too late.",1161820800,12,1877,4.7912772585669785

15368,5,0767817486,"As I think back over the decades, there have been a fair number of memorable films that I originally saw in the theatres and which have endured as favorites on DVD. Films like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, DRESSED TO KILL, ALIENS, THE STUNT MAN, THELMA & LOUISE, and THE ABYSS.

But for every decade, I can identify one theatrical release that hit me like a freight train, and which in my mind has become a cinematic monument. In the 1960s, it was BONNIE & CLYDE. In the 1980s, it was BETTY BLUE (37'2 LE MATIN). In the 1990s, it was BASIC INSTINCT. And so far in the current decade, I would give the honor to CHICAGO. I skipped the 1970s, but you know which film it was: MIDNIGHT EXPRESS.

I have read the reviews, and a good many of them deal with political issues, and whether the film is faithful to the facts. But just as I don't judge, say, Madonna's music based on my views of the singer as a human being, or whether the lyrics she writes are expressions of honesty, I don't judge films based on anything beyond what is actually produced on celluloid.

Various reviewers have praised the gritty cinematography, the Oscar-caliber acting, the riveting storyline, the Moroder score, and other aspects of this film. I cannot agree more. To my mind, a masterpiece is born when every element of the filmmaker's art converges perfectly to create a rare cinematic experience. This is the case for MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. When I walked out of the theater on my first viewing, I was shaken to the bone. The impact has since been diluted somewhat due to repeated viewings on VHS and on DVD, but my opinion of the film has not changed one iota. For me, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is still the number one cinematic masterpiece of the 1970s. This is a very personal appreciation, but I'm sure that any serious film student who is able to objectively analyze the film within the exclusive context of cinematic art would have to conclude that MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a true masterpiece.

When it comes to purchasing a film for viewing, there are any number of criteria: the artistic achievement of the film (e.g., MOULIN ROUGE), the extent to which the story is compelling (e.g., JAWS), how well the story is told (e.g., CLUELESS), and the psychological impact the film will have on the viewer (e.g., THE EXORCIST). Notice how the cited examples (I chose some obvious ones) arguably only satisfy one or two of these specific criteria.

Films that thoroughly satisfy are BONNE & CLYDE, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, BETTY BLUE, BASIC INSTINCT, and CHICAGO, and they all achieve masterpiece status in my pantheon. Not that others don't (e.g., MY FAIR LADY). But these are the films, one per decade, that I've placed highest on my altar.

I highly recommend this film to the objective viewer. You may or may not agree with my qualifying MIDNIGHT EXPRESS as a rare cinematic masterpiece, but you will never forget the raw emotional experience of it (personally, I've always found it more uplifting than depressing). In fact, in every way that a film can, this one will haunt you for life.",1154563200,6,3043,4.646840148698884

But on the other hand, it bothered me that this movie's trying to make me feel sympathy for someone who did a crime. In my opinion, he broke the law, therefore he got what he deserved. SOL pal!

It also appeared to me that this movie is trying to show ""US=good"" and ""Turkey=bad"". How irresponsible can people get? If you've paid any attention to current events, guess what? Turkey is now showing a movie called ""Valley of the Wolves"", in which Americans are demonized in the Iraq war. Supposedly it's a big hit over there in Turkey. Hmmm, I wonder why.

I vacationed in Turkey in 2005, and personally, I had a GREAT time. Turks are indeed hospitable (thanks for all the ""tourist tea""!). Not surprisingly, I did not see ONE American tour group. I was with a German one. Even the Japanese vacation in Turkey! But apparently not too many Americans. Hmmm, again, I wonder why.

A bit of advice if you're planning on going overseas and want to avoid that one-in-a-million chance of getting into the sort of prison this movie depicts:

1) TRY to learn the language

2) Blend in (don't wear your ""Proud to be American"" shirt over there

3) Respect/follow their customs

4) Don't do anything stupid (like smuggle Hashish).

If you want to watch a movie about a terrible prison with a lot more merit to it (and also based on a true story, to boot), then I HIGHLY recommend ""Papillon"" and also the book by the same title by Henri Charriere.",1147478400,7,1671,4.506622516556291
15381,4,0767817486,"Midnight Express is a brilliant film that reflects an historical moment that those of us of a certain age certainly remember.  The first time I watched it, I sympathized primarily with Billy.  Regardless of his conviction, no one deserves the sadistic treatment he received throughout his incarceration.  And so what if the film makers changed some of the story?  It's a movie - fiction - not a documentary.

All the same - during a recent viewing, I covered my eyes in disbelief at Billy's unbelievably stupid and oblivious smuggling scheme. That's it kid - smuggle hash out of a country in political turmoil whose laws are arbitrarily and brutally enforced by the nation's military police.

How dumb can you be?

In the mid-seventies, not long after Billy's prison escape, I travelled round Turkey where everyone, Turks and Westerners alike, partook of certain substances.  In Istanbul we frequented the infamous Pudding Shop, location of a cop scene in Midnight Express, never once imagining that anyone could, or would, be busted there.  During a five day stay with Turkish farmers, heavily armed soldiers at random MP roadblocks stopped our car four times.

So who's the dumb one?

Midnight Express is a valuable primer on what not to do when travelling that shows the dreadful consequences of breaking laws in a state that lacks the legal safeguards we have (or used to have till W took office), and that I think some Americans too easily take for granted.  I am not passing judgement on Turkey, or on any country - but the reality is that some prison systems are worse than others.

15385,4,0767817486,"I randomly picked up a borrowed library copy of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS to test a new DVD player.  I was scarcely thinking about what film was actually in there and when the image of Brad Davis standing anxiously in line at a Turkish airport popped on the screen, I thought, ""Oh, it's Brad Pitt (with a dye job).  Of course, I had seen MIDNIGHT EXPRESS before, so I knew better, but sometimes our subconscious makes interesting connections that our conscious minds never would.

If MIDNIGHT EXPRESS had been filmed in the early 90s, say, rather than the late 70s, it would have been easy to imagine Pitt taking on the role.  Whether he would have been as effective as his namesake, the late Mr Davis, strikes me as doubtful--but certainly possible.  Pitt does go for edgy roles from time to time (e.g. FIGHT CLUB).  But I guess the key difference between the two Brads is that Pitt became a break-out superstar after only a few films, whereas Davis created a bit of a splash with this one and had trouble following this success with anything nearly as memorable. (Well, there was QUERELLE--which is certainly, uh, memorable).

Such is the luck of the draw in Hollywood, as well as elsewhere.  Davis, of course, lived only to age 41 and died as one of the film industry's most notable AIDS casualties.  He did, actually, work steadily until shortly before his death.  But true stardom--assuming he actually sought it--eluded him, despite his talent and appeal.

A role like that of Billy Hayes doesn't come along all that often for a young actor, and certainly didn't any more so thirty years ago.  Relatively few young people of that era actually wound up in a Turkish prison, of course, but Billy's attempt to smuggle a moderate amount of hashhish out of Turkey was reflective of the druggie derring-do of the era.  It was,inessence, the classic crazy youthful stunt, and if Billy had pulled it off, he no doubt would have relished having an exciting foreign adventure tale to tell his friends as they turned on back in the States.  One thing's for sure, he never would have expected a life sentence in a brutal Turkish prison.

Screenwriter Oliver Stone and director Alan Parker evoke the era from the outset by throwing in numerous 60s-type references (the frisbee that baffles airport security; the headlines referring to Janis Joplin's death and Nixon's declaration of war on terror).  It's a very canny cinematic set-up: a naive, playful and play-acting young American falls victim to the ultimate grim ""Establishment"" (a labyrinthine, foreign culture--which is even less inclined to show mercy than the most conservative U.S court would be).

Foreign jail flicks all tend toward the Kafka-esque.  From the first day of his incarceration, Billy attempts to learn the codes and signals that will enable his survival in this proverbial hell on earth.  In an early scene, he is corralled into some kind of mug shot which actually turns out to be a kind of grotesque group shot with his captors.  They're laughing and fooling around at first, and Billy almost instinctively joins in, until one of the guards slaps the silly grin off his face.  Billy has yet to learn the code at that point.  As the perp, he's not allowed to share in the hilarity of the moment.

In time, he does learn to adapt better and begins to cope--until he's within 53 days of his scheduled release date for possession.  A sudden legal reversal, however, shifts his sentence to a full 30 years--for smuggling--and he is thrown into a vortex of despair.  And that's when he explodes.  As does the movie.

I understand that Oliver Stone actually wound up apologizing for the film's supposedly ""anit-Turk"" sentiment.  That's an interesting development.  And a point that can be legitimately debated.  Many years ago, I read the book, and  although I don't recall it all that well, I remember realizing that the film I had seen a few years before was largely-maybe grossly?-fictionalized.  No one expects strict adherence to the facts from a Hollywood dramatization, but of course, when dealing with issues like ethnic bias, the slandering of entire nation, the issue of truthfulness becomes all the murkier.  We all understand screenwriters alter facts, combine personages, and streamline the timeline for dramatic purposes.  We also have little reason to doubt that a Turkish jail (at least a 1970s Turkish jail) may not have indeed been hell on earth  The question is just what circle of hell was it really?

So what do you have at the end of the day,  ""essential truths"" or  ""an ethnic smear campaign""?

Well, at the end of my day, I would have to say that it basically comes down to the ""inner truths"" playing in Billy Hayes' (the MOVIE'S Billy Hayes') own head.  Dramatically, the hatred he develops for Turkey and all things Turkish makes a certain sense.  And his worst utterances are delivered when he is in extremis certainly.  Discerning viewers will realize that it is the character speaking, not necessarily the filmmakers.

When it came out in 1978 MIDNIGHT EXPRESS was recent enough history that many members of its target audience could identify with Billy Hayes.  If you look at customer reviews posted in recent years on Amazon and elsewhere, you may find that many fewer people sympathize with the character today.  That says something about our own times too.  Back in the 60s and 70s,  there was a good deal of ""that-could-have-been-MY-kid"" sentiment.  I don't see that kind of compassion-and that's what it is--as much these days. I kind of miss it.",1138924800,5,5536,4.845580404685836

This is a nasty, pig-blood ugly little flick: Alan Parker (who also directed the equally moody, sultry, sweaty, stinky, and scary ""Angel Heart) reaches deep into your cowardly heart and pulls out the true guts of fear: you're young, you're stupid, you're American, and you've really messed the hell up in a brutal, capricious, totally alien land. You're in *their* System, baby, and that System brooks absolutely no tapdancing bullsh*t artists.

So basically we sweep down into the wild, soon-to-be-arrested life of Billy Hayes (the late great Brad Davis, who owns every second of his screen time and is completely astounding in this role), wildcatting young American, strapped up with premium Turkish hash, about to move it and shake it through customs at the Istanbul airport. Hey, man, chill: the dude needs the money.

The problem is, he's sweating like a dog. He's with his girlfriend, who has zero clue: he's all strapped up, ready to drop bombs he thinks, but he's naive. And the Turks are onto him: they send out half their army to block him from hopping his plane, and the fun begins.

Basically: he gets dragooned into Turkish police custody. He gets the baby-kissing treatment from the hapless US embassy guy: he gets hauled into court, he gets jibber-jabbered at by the Judge and Prosecutor. He has absolutely no clue of the deep sh*t he's in. No fine rattling Camaros in the High Green American Summertime for Bill Hayes, no sirree.

He gets life in a Turkish prison.

The rest, really, should be for you to encounter; Bill Hurt (Max) in all his decadent English goodness: Norbert Weisser (Erich) as the prison confidant; the Great Peter Jeffrey as Ahmet, the Really Bad Machine; and of course, the implacable, sadistic Paul Smith as prison Major Domo Hamidou, who has a fat kid and is a total monster.

The film is bitter, and very much alive, very real: Brad Davis is even more astounding, in that he very much dissolves into his character, this modern day Montecristo who realizes that penance is just not enough, and seriously---when does Punishment itself become Crime

When it really comes down to it, you---Gentle Reader---have no idea how narrowly you walk on the right side of the Law. A little too much booze, a second behind the wheel, and you might find yourself in a tank, cuffed, frisked, strip-searched, gutted of dignity, deeply ashamed.

15389,4,0767817486,"Billy Hayes went to my high school, a few years ahead of me.  This was an all boys school on Long Island and when he was in jail at that Turkish prison we used to joke that it was better than being stuck in our high school, and also that on the whole the freshman class did more hashish every day than Billy Hayes was able to smuggle across the entire width of his body.  We encouraged to pray for the soul of our fellow schoolmate William Hayes who was languishing in prison, unjustly convicted.  Good looking guy, though not so sublime as Brad Davis, who plays him in the movie.

Billy's girlfriend Susan, who joins him in a half-baked scheme to smuggle moderate quantities of hashish out of Istanbul, is played by the incredible Irene Miracle.  A year or so later she was to come into her element fully as Rose Elliot in Argento's masterful INFERNO, but here she is more subdued, though still ravishingly beautiful.  She and Brad Davis have got to be the hottest couple ever put on film.  Of course their love gets torn apart once the jail portion of the movie begins, around reel 3.  Giorgio Moroder, whose soundtrack is one of the epochal moments of 1970s cinema, wrote a beautiful love theme for Billy and Susan, it is tender and filled with longing and frustration.  Sometimes I hear that theme played even on elevator Muzak and even now it brings back all the sorrow of lovers violently parted from each other, like Nino Rota's theme from the Zeffirelli ROMEO AND JULIET.

Is the movie racist for depicting Turks as menacing, ugly, brutish thugs?  Maybe so.  Maybe that's the lure of the movie, to suck you in telling you this is a true story and thus letting your moral judgments get go off the hook.  The book on which this book is based shows a different angle on the story (in addition, Billy admits to enjoying sex in prison with men, an element that Oliver Stone excised out completely, later making up for it I suppose by including Jared Leto in his movie ALEXANDER), but while watching MIDNIGHT EXPRESS all you experience is fear.  I'm sure that the success of this movie led to the depressing statistic that only 19 per cent of Americans own or use passports.

But being beaten, tortured and imprisoned in a foriegn country, with limited contact with family and freinds is going to be traumatic for anyone, and the movie dispays that well.

With that said, however, I think the movie deviates WAY too much from the book.  The escape first-handedly described in the book is much more fascinating and would have been better to see than the movies deviation.  The ommision of some the amnesties to prisoners makes the movie fall short as well.

15412,5,0767817486,"Firt off i am 18, remember that. So, when i read the review for this movie i was thinking that perhaps it had something to do with the Hollicost but i was really mistaken. At first when i was watching it i was like OMG what's gonna happen. I was a little confused and somewhat bored but the more that i watched it the more i was entranced by it. I really had a hard time getting up to answer the phone while i was watching it. I don't want to ruin it for anyone but this sadly TRUE story involves a man who is caught trying to smuggle hash out of the country of turkey i belive it is. He is caught and prized for one of the biggest smugglers of all times. He was in the prison for several years enduring cruel tortures and harsh people, he was just trying to live for himself. You tend to find yourself rooting for this person, as he progresses he becomes gradually worse and more troubled. In the end he is found insane or so they thought and forced to stay in an area where the really truly terminally ill reside. I will not spoil and say what the end was like but i must tell you if you really love this movie then you MUST read the book, if your not a reader get it on tape you will love the book as well.

Leaving aside the whole ""Is the film racist?"" discussion that taking up so much space I think what bothers me about it is the way Billy Hayes is portrayed as some sort of tragic hero, a misguided youth victimized by a brutal system. For God's sake, he was a drug smuggler! I think the script should have played up on that angle a bit more and we would have had a much more thoughtprovoking film. On the plus side, though, there are some very good performances and the soundtrack is worth hearing.",1112227200,6,569,4.377358490566038
15414,1,0767817486,Midnight Express has quite a reputation for being a harrowing experience but I find the film quite contrived and lightweight.  If you want to check out some disturbing prison flicks I recommend Scum and Scrubbers.  The film starts of well and tense but then loses all pace and feels as real as a TVM.  Billy Hayes was a drug smuggler simple as that.  I'm sure his time in prison was quite uneventful as the tongue biting scene was totally out of character but one of the rare highlights in this throughly dull movie.  We got his long drawn out build up to the escape and when it happened everything was over in 10 minutes. I also did not see any caucasian Turkish prison guards with 5 days growth and long straggy hair but he managed to fool the twenty guards he walked past. I think the director had reached breaking point as well. Talk about a cheap ending various photographs of family members meeting him at the airport they must have run out of money.  Lowlight of the film the slushy scene in the shower with the hair bear bunch.  Highlight Irene Miracle's knockers.  The reason this whining garbage gets one star.,1110499200,7,1120,4.50990099009901

15416,4,0767817486,"Midnight Express (1978) is one of those few films I heard a great deal about, but haven't had the opportunity to see...until recently.  Based on a book written by a man who committed a crime in another land, went to trial, was convicted and imprisoned, eventually escaped, and wrote a book about his experiences, a lot of controversy seems to be generated over the whether or not various events in the film actually happened.  Given Hollywood's penchant for changing elements in stories so that they may best come across the screen, I decided, even though the film was based on a true story, to take that with a grain of salt and just watch the film as a film.

Directed by Alan Parker (he was nominated for an academy award for this film), screenplay by the seemingly always controversial Oliver Stone (he won for best adaptation of a screenplay from another medium), the film stars Brad Davis (Chariot's of Fire) as Billy Hayes, the man who escaped and wrote the book the movie was based on...also appearing are John Hurt (he won best supporting actor for his role), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie from the Vacation movies) and Paul Smith (Bluto, from Robin Williams' Popeye movie).

The film begins with Billy Hayes strapping packets of heroin to his body, prior to his leaving the country of Turkey.  Tsk, tsk Billy...possession is one thing, but smuggling?  So very naughty...anyway, due to increased terrorist attacks, all passengers traveling by airplane are searched thoroughly, and Billy gets caught.  No big surprise there...if he hadn't, this would have been a pretty short film.  Imagine getting arrested in a foreign country, one where you don't speak the language.  Pretty scary, I would think.  Anyway, things actually don't appear that bad for Billy, but we know different.  Eventually Billy receives 4 years on a possession charge (the prosecutor was looking for a smuggling charge, which carries a life sentence in Turkey).  Conditions are poor, to say the least, in the prison, as Billy suffers many of the things you'd expect one to suffer being in prison.  Attempts by his family, his lawyer, and American government officials are for naught as Billy serves his time.  Shortly before his time in prison is up, Billy learns that a higher court has ruled that the possession charge he was originally convicted on has been reviewed by a higher court, and they have now decided to charge him with smuggling, increasing his term to 30 years, or, basically a life sentence, given the quality of life in the prison.  At this point Billy explodes in the court as the ruling is handed down, and he reacts badly, understandably so, calling the court and its' members a `bunch of pigs' (probably not the words I would have used, as they certainly won't endear you to your captors, but whatever).  Now a matter of life or death in Billy's mind, he decides he has no choice but to escape.  And try he does...eventually he does, returns home, and decides to write a book about his experience, one that becomes a movie one day, adapted for the screen by Oliver Stone...isn't this where we began?

Now first of all, I have to say, for the life of me, I just couldn't develop any sympathy for the main character.  Let's face it...he was a criminal, got caught, and sent to prison.  Here's a tip for the youngsters out there...if you are planning to commit a crime, especially in a foreign country, it's probably a good idea to research the consequences, specifically how much jail time is involved if you get caught (for instance smuggling drugs in Turkey will get you a life sentence).  The film seemed to spend a lot of time focusing on the brutal and sadistic conditions within the prison, and trying to give the audience justification for Billy's need to escape (that was the way I saw it), but again, he committed a crime, and got caught, so I still found it extremely difficult to feel sad for Billy.  Just because he was an American, he shouldn't be bound by whatever laws exist in the particular country he's in?  I don't think so...I did think Brad Davis did a great job caught up in forces he didn't understand.  I thought John Hurt was good as Max, a perpetually drugged out Englishman in prison with Billy, but I didn't feel he was Academy Award good.  I did think Randy Quaid was really good as another prisoner named Jimmy Booth, a constantly angry man whose entire existence seemed to be based on devising a means to escape from prison (his crime was stealing two candlesticks from mosque, a very serious, and stupid, crime, apparently).  So how much of the story was real and how much of it was exaggerated?  I suppose only Billy knows, but I think there is a clear message here, and it's not that people shouldn't visit Turkey.  No, I the message I got was don't commit crimes in Turkey, or any other country, for that matter.  Having to go to prison sucks, and I am sure the quality of life within these prisons varies greatly, but regardless, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime.  Pure and simple.  Ultimately, as far as prison films go, this is a gripping, sometimes harsh to view yarn, but not the best one I've ever seen.  One of the best, in my opinion, is Papillon (1973), starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, which, oddly enough, is also based on a true story.

Provided on this DVD is both the wide screen and full screen formats.  I've only watched the wide screen format, and while the picture is good, I felt it could have been better, maybe cleaned up a little, giving us a better tone throughout.  Special features include a theatrical trailer and a short featurette with the real Billy Hayes (nice perm, dude) on location of the movie shoot.

15417,5,0767817486,"Jeff Shannon's review is nonsense. He accuses ""Midnight Express"" of being manipulative. What does he think film making is? Films--and art in general--are nothing more than manipulation in order to achieve a desired effect, whether to scare us, make us cry, or make us laugh. It's all about manipulation. I read Billy Hayes original book accounting his true life experiences in Turkey; overall, the film holds true to the autobiography, although it shies away from Hayes's own self-professed positive homosexual experiences while in prison. I suppose audiences in 1978 wouldn't be able to handle that. In the film, Hayes is shown as rejecting any kind of homosexual advance, although he does so kindly. Regardless, the film is powerful and has visually stunning cinematography, something that is lacking in today's films. This is one of those films you show friends who have never seen it or heard of it. Almost all will come away awestruck. It is a remarkable film achievement. It's one of the top films of the 1970s--and in the decade of ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and ""The Godfather,"" just to name a few, that's saying a lot!",1097193600,5,1156,4.994818652849741

Watch this as you watch Shawshank Redemption. This isn't and wasn't Turkey. I didn't even understand what those Turks(?) in the movie was sayin' Ah yeah this was Armenians who tried to speak Turkish. Somethings may have happened 30 years ago in that prison but this is not different than what happened in Robert Redford's Brubaker. And what about the court scene in this one. ""You Turks don't eat pig but you are all pigs, your food suck, let me .... all your people women bla bla bla"" Nobody blamed American culture in prison movies. Nobody made any generalizations about any culture in any prison movie but this one. So, from a cultural standpoint this movie is nothing but a manipulation, provocation, scandal, illusion and a total lie. Mentioned earlier, watch this so-called true story as you watch Shawshank.

15440,3,0767817486,"The movie was fairly accurate.  The penalties for drug smuggling are severe and were realistically represented in this film.

However, I do have to object to the portrayal of abuses and tortures occuring in Turkish prisons.  This film seemed to paint the Turks as sadistic and vicious in the running of their correctional facilities.  In isolated cases, this may occur but in much lesser degrees than this movie displays.

I know this firsthand because I did a five year stint in Turkish prison.  Admittedly, I am a little more backboned than the average American tourist who finds himself getting pinched while trafficing Hashish out of Turkey but I could easily have done the entire 5 years standing on my head.

I certainly don't want to be a Turkish inmate again but if circumstances held it in the cards that I was required to serve another 5 year stint, I wouldn't even flinch but suck it up like a man.

I'm not saying it's Disney world over there, kids.  IT'S NOT!  Don't follow my mistakes.  But movies like this severely exaggerate the life inside a Turkish prison.

Turkish prison guards look at American drug smugglers much the same way as American prison guards look at ""celebrity gangsters"" here in the States.  For an American drug smuggler, Turkish prison life would more accurately be portrayed by the scenes in Goodfellas rather than by the scenes in Midnight Express.  In my case, since I am not Italian, rather than making pasta and garlic tomato sauce, they overlooked my contraband of pork chops and mashed potatos.",1094256000,12,1537,4.816793893129771

Most of the movie wasn't even shot in Turkey. The reviews here made me very upset, more than the movie itself. People have the tendency to judge a country and its entire people based on a movie, which was shot in 1978. Midnight Express is not just a movie. Turkey has been fighting with this image for the whole time.

It is a true story, all right. There are a lot of movies based on true stories in which the moral is all wrong. If you've seen this movie and you think this country is a terrible place, I'd say think again.

1. Criminals are not welcome in any country in the world. If you are a drug dealer, do it in your country.

2. Time is passing and things change. For countries like Turkey, things get better and better every single day. In this movie, you are looking at a 30-year-old misrepresented image of a country. A lot of things have changed in the last thirty years, the judgemental system and the police have changed all over. Turkey had a huge incentive to change, the EU. And hopefully it will be a member soon.

3. TURKEY IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. Believe it or not, it is!!! Turkey's biggest revenue is tourism. If it was that scary, tens of millions of people wouldn't go to Turkey every year. Turkish people are known with their hospitality. They are not some kind of uncivilized monsters, like some critics here and the movie itself have implied.

Davis performance is exceptional, yet did not give him the career you'd expect.  An excellent actor, who died at the age of 41.

Randy Quaid is also good in the most dramatic role I've seen him play.  I reccomend this movie to any fan of cinema.  It is a fine dramatic work which is given even more weight by the fact that it is based on a true story.
I don't normally right reviews, but i felt i had to after reading some other reviews.  It seems that some people are looking at this movie as representing an entire nation of people.  The truth is, Turkey is not a barbaric country.  The truth is, Islam is not a barbaric religion.  This is not to say that Billy Hayes was not abused and wronged by a corrupt system.  He clearly was.  But i hope people are not assuming that the country and people of Turkey approved of this.  I assure you that is not the case.  In fact, Istanbul is not unlike any major american city.  I just found myself at a loss when reading a couple of reviews of this film.  It seems to me that we need more acceptance and understanding in these times.  Taking a movie like Midnight Express as an indictment of a nation is a mistake.  This is a movie about the strength of the human spirit against great adversity.  If anything this movie brings up questions of US foreign policy.  It seems that some reviewers missed the point in the movie where it was made clear that Richard Nixon had completely fouled up relations between the US and Turkey.

15448,2,0767817486,"This used to be one of my favorite movies but it no longer is. When I was younger I did not bother trying to comprehend the underlying message of this movie, nor any other movie for that matter. The message of this movie is now perfectly clear to me: convicts in Turkish prisons are frequently maltreated and tortured. Turkish prisons are inhumane and the entire justice system is flawed, corrupt and unjust. Moreover, the director of this movie implicitly implies that all Turks are barbarous, intransigent and uncivilized. This is corroborated by the fact that all Turkish characters in this movie are evil and their intentions are always malicious. Also an attempt is made to defame Islam and to show it as a religion which is inhumane, barbaric and merciless. On the other hand, Christians are depicted as humane and infallible. The principal point of this movie is that the Turkish society is flawed and atavistic as its justice system shows no mercy towards drug smugglers, rapists and murderers. Many of these assertions may be true but it would be a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification to claim that all of this is true and that these injustices are unique for Turkey. The director of this movie should have done some research at home before he set out to criticize an entire nation. Consider some of these facts: U.S.A. still has capital punishment; it has been demonstrated in many cases that the application of the death penalty is racially discriminatory (much more blacks are sentenced to death than whites); in many states, minors and mentally retarded are sentenced to death even though this violates the U.S. constitution; the U.S. government incarcarates people without letting them know what they have been charged with and denies them adequate legal representation etc. (Guantanamo Bay in Cuba). If these facts are not indicative of a flawed and unjust justice system, then what is? In my view, it is extremely hypocritical and cynical not to judge our own actions and transgressions by the same standards we apply to others.

Amnesty International has well-documented cases of such violent acts committed against people that the govt. deems ""guilty"" of even the most minor offenses. Women are subject to rape and forcible vaginal examination at the hands of deranged policemen and young men are sodomized as punishment for their ""alleged"" crimes.
Ignore the claims of racism made by pro-Turkish pundits that this film supposedly displays. This film is NOT racist. If the truth is racist, then let the truth be shown in its' most brutal detail. What we see in the film are real, actual events that happen to both Turks and non-Turks in Turkey, every single day. While it's true that Billy Hayes did not experience every single act of torture in this film, Oliver Stone and Alan Parker simply culled through the records of Amnesty International and gave voice to the countless victims of a brutal regime that has yet to this day to change its' human rights record.
This is a film that should be bought and watched periodically to remind ourselves of the kinds of depraved govts. that exist around the world and how they abuse human rights aimed at not only their own people but to Americans as well.

15463,5,0767817486,"Given our on-line ""Amazonian"" context; this will be almost as much a review of the other reviews as it is about ""Midnight Express"". <G>

Pure and simple.  If you have never witnessed this classic of a movie; it's a must see.  If you have seen it; like a good book, it's well worth periodically revisting.

The controversey about the portrayal of Turks and Turkey is mostly nonsense.  Only a fool would generalize from a Hollywood movie loosely based on a book to conclude that Turkey is (or was) an awful uncivilized place or that the Turkish people are all monsters. Human affairs just aren't that simple.

The kinds of inhumane abuses portrayed in ""Midnight Express"" are happening all over the world all the time...I dare say there are many dark corners in the US prison system in which people are shafted in all manner of ways.

What this movie does as well as anything I've ever seen on screen is to evoke in the viewer an empathetic respose to the hell that the main character suffers.  You are drawn into the inner world experience of horror and mind/heart breaking angst that anyone who is being unjustly imprisoned and abused must go through.

Fortunately, one can also be drawn into the righteous rage and defiance and rekindling of hope that the on screen Billy Hayes portrays so stunningly.  The scene in which he is visited in prison by his loyal loving girlfriend is a wrenching work of Art.

The crtiques calling this film ""manipulative"" are absurd; that's what good movies are *supposed* to do.....otherwise it's just light on a screen.  I suspect that some people can't, or won't, handle the intensity of this masterpiece. There are also those who see it as nothing more than a manifestation of anti-Turkish propaganda.  It's a shame that these poor folk can't get beyond their own fixations and limitations.

""Midnight Express"" is, in it's best moments, a stunningly wonderful celebration of the human spirit of love AND of the imperative toward freedom and justice that is at the very core of human be-ing.  It is *those* moments in the film (and in life! ;-) that make it worthwhile/possible to bear (and struggle with) all manner of  hellacious circumstances.

Contrary to superficial appearances ""Midnight Express"" is a positive uplifting affimation of life that deserves to seen and appreciated for generations to come.",1057881600,10,2341,4.871212121212121
15464,4,0767817486,"After watching this movie a few times, I finally read the book and came to realize the movie is indeed only a partial recollection. The only really bad things that happened to Billy Hayes when he was in prison in Turkey were the incident where he slugged a trustee for self-defense after stealing a blanket and a couple guards practicing their strokes on the soles of his feet. The real Billy also did not call the Turks pigs and instead apologized for his mistake. By the end of the book, he was scheduled to be released in 1978, but escaped from an island in the Aegan sea on a dinghy, not impalling the head guards' head on a hook. From what I heard from Turks who saw this movie, the Turkish characters spoke an incomprehensible gibberish, but also most of the actors playing Turks were Italian, and in one case, the head guard was an American who just happened to play Bluto in the Robin Williams version of Popeye. One thing about the movie I don't quite understand: Who in the world was the American (Bo Hopkins) that takes Billy Hayes into his custody to hunt down the drug dealer, and then has him arrested after he attempts to elude the police, then he and the detectives in the case are not even in court during Hayes' trial?

They were showing how the life like in turkey and asking ordinary turks on street what they think about usa and coming war against irak. It was quite interesting. It looked to me a good blend of moderate midle eastern and western life style. But I noticed most of the calls were about Armenian genocide claims which was not the subject. Another caller said that he went to turkey recently and found people anti western and anti american. He also mentioned about the movie "" Midnight Express""
I watched the mowie years ago it is a good prison mowie I blieved it was a true story.
I just finished reading the book.it looks like oliver stone made up and add  some parts to take more attention. Besides that I started reading about turkey and here what I found
-there is a big anti-turkish propaganda in usa by Armenian and greek origin americans(which hurts american interests sometimes)
-Turkey only prodominantly moslim and domacratic country in the world
-Turkey recently abolished deth penalty (which is still in use in some states in usa) and had some good improvments in civil and minority rights.
-The Armenian genocide has not been  proved by historians yet.
-public opinion in turkey obout America is second best in all muslim countries with % 58 percent

15466,4,0767817486,"The only word I can think of to accurately describe this film. Midnight Express at its' core is an expose not of the Turkish prison system but of the brutality that man is capable of. Based on true events, Midnight Express follows the life of American Billy Hayes, who is caught trying to smuggle a small amount of hashish on to his plane. Needless to say he is caught and sentenced to serve time in a Turkish prison. Billy endures endless torture both physical and mental during his tenure in the prison. There is one particularly beastly guard who looks like James Gandolfini from the Sopranos; anyway this guard loves to whoop up on the prisoners, especially the Americans. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions with plenty of twists and turns. The film score is nothing short of haunting. The use of sound and music in this film add a whole other level of horror to an already hellish situation. Some film buffs might also notice Randy Quaid in one of his earliest film roles as another American imprisoned with Billy. Overall, Midnight Express left me with a sick feeling. It challenges the viewer to endure countless acts of violence and brutality and yet still believe in the strength of the human spirit. A must own for any serious DVD collector.

I was disturbed and totally disgusted with his ignorance. How could a man in his sane mind could make judgements based on hollywood productions?
The Turkish hate this movie with a passion.any other viewers here should try to understand that Turkey is a developng country trying very hard to advertise itself and try to shed off the barbaric image the ottoman empire left it with.a movie like  the midnight express could evoke a lot of prejudice and hatred against Turkey -especially for those who could not even tell f Turkey was a bird or a country.
Leaving my patriotic emotions aside,As an artist I have to be totally impartial. It was well done. The acting was superb, soundtrack above the standards for it's time and the plot,totally striking.
Just remember,this is not a documentary,its an artistic interpretation of someone who has never been to the Tukish Jail at the time of the event-neither have I.

15468,4,0767817486,"Why Brad Davis did not receive an Oscar nomination, I can't understand.  Well, he DID kiss another man and even though Hollywood is filled with homosexuals, the industry is very homophobic.  What a shame.  This was a glorious performance.  Likewise, Davis' bravery in the realm of homosex in ""Querelle"" was also ignored by the Oscars.  In that film, he went ""all out"" having sex with men and tongue-kissing to boot!
Great acting in ""Boys in the Band"" was completely ignored in 1972 by the Academy, so I shouldn't be surprised at this particular snub. Women and homosex is excused, of course.
I recommend this film mainly because it warns people, who might break laws in other countries, NOT to take a chance.  Once you are stuck in a foreign prison, your country might not be sympathetic towards you, an American lawbreaker and embarrassment (remember, they have better things to do).
Americans have this notion that they are ""special"".  We have a warped idea of what it is being American.  People in other countries are NOT impressed by us.  We are considered the most racist country on the planet and we are embarrassed by our toothless racists that expose themselves to the world in the media.

15480,1,0767817486,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen ever. This is a story about a man, nammed Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who tries to smuggle hessise(turkish drug) across the boader to America. But there is one small problem he gets caught. He is sentecenced to serve four years in a turkish prison. Billy leaves a worried girlfriend, father, mother, brother, and sister behind. In the prison he meets durgies and a whole new kind of people he never thought would exsist. The guards beat and tourcher not only him but everybody in that prison and other prisons in that part of the world were just the same. In Turkey who don't have the right to free speech like in America so when he went to court he had a hard time trying to defend himself. Billy is then sentenced to 30 years in the prison which I might add does not really qualify as a prison at all in my opinon. Billy and Rand quaid and one other person try to escape for every day for a whole week but then they are caught by a inmatte who gives randy qaid away. Randy is beaten so bad that he is in a hospital for months with a hernia. Billy gets so mad he kills ruski the immate who gives them away and basically goes insane witth rage and then immeditly after he is sent to a turkish mental institution with pyscos. His girlfriend talks to him and he has a new light os getting out. He bribes then kills a guard puts on his uniform and leaves. Three months later he crosses the boarder into Greece and gets on a plane and goes back to America to reunite with his family.

That does not mean that this is exactly what happened to Billy Hayes or that this is exactly how the prisons are in Turkey. This is Oliver Stone's writing at it's best. I loved this movie.
Brad Davis is phenomenal as Billy Hayes and it's a shame that he couldn't get his own real life together and become the star he should have become. Brad reminded me a lot of James Dean in this film. His acting, his looks, even the way he spoke. It was quite eerie actually. Brad deserved much better than one memorable film and a death, so cruel.
This is supposed to be a 20th Anniversary Edition dvd, which would suggest commentaries, deleted scenes and a host of other extras, but there is none of this. ...It's a real drag that this film doesn't get the proper dvd treatment it deserves. The featurette is nothing more than a VERY SHORT documentary on the life of the real Billy Hayes that was made in the late 70's. If you're looking for new information, you've come to the wrong place. The only thing that's great about this dvd is the transfer. It looks great for the most part, crisp and clean with very few artifacts and very little edge enhancement, though some of the scenes were very dark, which is probably the way they were originally shot. I'm not sure if it's just my dvd or if everyone else's dvd has a problem, but when Billy is meeting his Turkish lawyer for the first time and they are shaking hands they're is a slight ""roll"" in the dvd. Kind of like if you were watching this movie in the theater and the projector got hung up for a frame or two. It's not that bad but I thought I would mention it.
This is a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone who has never seen it. This movie holds up very well for being over 20 years old and it's still relevant today. I just wish it would have gotten much better treatment in this 20th Anniversary Edition. *sigh*",990921600,11,1980,4.2686170212765955
15486,5,0767817486,"Midnight Express is without a doubt, an excellent masterpiece in the art and history of motion pictures. Not only for its fine acting (the roles played by the late Brad Davis, British actor John Hurt - who won the best supporting actor Oscar for the film, Randy Quaid, Norbert Weissler, and Paul L. Smith), its Academy Award winning soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder, and its screenplay by Oliver Stone. But for British director Alan Parker's directorial style, and the clear message of how a foreign country can be very barbaric. Especially when it comes to dealing with prisoners from other countries who violate their laws.
I can understand how the 1978 film caused a bit of controversy. But, knowing Oliver Stone, he was making a very serious point about how Turkish society can be very brutal and how its government and people can be so inhumane. Granted Stone may have taken a few liberties on Billy Hayes' true story, but he ultimately got the point across about how the Turkish deal with prisoners and how inhumane their laws really are. Obviously, the film cut right to the bone and struck a lot of nerves in the Turkish people. The only reason they were offended and had the film banned was because the truth about Turkey came out into the open, and really hurt them. If they were not so barbaric against foreign prisoners, such secrets would not have been exposed.
I'm not defending Billy Hayes's actions. What he did was wrong, and yes, he had to be punished. But not punished in such a barbaric way, and then used as a political scapegoat by a very barbaric and repressive Middle Eastern society. Stone's screenplay and Parker's direction in the film was trying to get that message across. And they both succeeded on all those levels. Everyone involved in the British production deserved an award for making such an excellent film. A film based on a true story that shocked many. You may not feel any sympathy toward Hayes' plight in the beginning, but near the end of the film, you will. And, for all the film's dark, gritty, violent, and depressing subject matter, it will make you think and remember.
Trivia Note - Originally Mark Hamill wanted to audition for the role of Billy Hayes, but due to Hamill's popularity as Luke Skywalker in The Star Wars Trilogy, Alan Parker felt Hamill was not suited for the role and refused to meet him. Think of what it would have been like for Hamill to have appeared in the film?",990576000,7,2428,4.675233644859813
15487,4,0767817486,"Reading some of these previous reviews is quite interesting in that in some of the critiques there is so much speculation as to what really happened to Billy Hayes in Turkey and what's a product of the Hollywood movie/money making machine. I've even read other reviews where some viewers are debating with others about foreign prisoner policies or lack of,etc.,etc. Only the real Billy Hayes knows how much info he has told the public. Some critics see his time spent in Turkey prison as a period of martyrdom. While others just remember his act that got him there in the first place as moronic. All I want to do is review this movie based on,well, the movie itself...No political debates, questions, agendas or issues here.
The movie was very suspenseful right from the get go. Giorgio Moroder's musical score,while such synthesizer work seems so outdated by today's standards now,adds to the intensity;eerie electronic effects,etc. Who can forget the famous Chase theme. The late Brad Davis was perfectly cast. You see his fine acting in the film as he transforms from a wide-eyed and naive, yet intelligent(or not so) American in a foreign land into a  violent, maniacal,and broken down prisoner who reaches subhuman level.  In fact, it's astonishing how another actor 20 some years later strongly resembles him in almost every way;Brad Pitt. Minus the fact one had black hair, the other is blonde. It would be incredible to see Midnight Express re-made with Pitt in the lead role...Randy Quaid was also memorable as the hyper and tempestuous cell mate planning the first escape. John Hurt's character serves as the voice of reason which is a contracdiction since he's mostly stoned throughout the film and in the same prison for his own crime. The cinematography is foreign (pun intended), gritty, grimy and has plenty of shady/sleazy characters from the consolate(actor Bo Hopkins),lawyers, and court system to the other inmates. The prison warden is nothing more than probably a criminal himself and fits every bit the stereotypical prison villain one can expect in a film who abuses his authority and relishes releasing his own personal brand of hell upon the inmates...The ending of the film is something else. Just as I felt the nervous intensity from the beginning, I felt it in my gut at the end !
Again, if the powers that be and Hollywood's listening,re-make this film with Brad Pitt and see what we get. Probably shadings of other characters he's played from the lunatic in 12 Monkeys to what we see now in his latest film The Mexican and other various films...Give me credit for the idea if it get's done (yeah, right).",983318400,11,2634,4.91685393258427

This story of a young American caught smuggling Hashish out of Istanbul goes out of its way to depict Turkey as a brutal, corrupt country, full of ""furriners.""

I would be surprised if anyone of Turkish descent were not deeply offended by this.
As long as you don't take it too seriously, Midnight Express can be an enjoyable non-think action movie.  John Hurt and Randy Quaid contribute superb performances, and Paul Smith does a convincing job of portraying the sadistic prison warden.  (It's a safe bet that no actual Turks were used in the making of this film, which was shot in Malta.)  Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack has dated badly, but is still catchy.

15515,1,0767817486,"April 23, 2000
As you know, Alan Parker is a director and Midnight Express, won two Academy Awards in 1978, was directed by him.  He said that this movie was his most effective movie.  Midnight Express was showed as  based on true story belonging to Billy Hayes and its lead player was Brad  Davis.  Sure, it directed by Alan Parker and written by Oliver Stone.  Shortly, the movie begins with Brad Davis' caught while he is smuggling  drugs out of T&uuml;rkiye.  Then he was sent to prison and he faced lots of  events out of humanity.  The most effective parts of the movie are these  torture scenes thought as horrible by the viewers.  We can see that  Midnight Express, caused many arguments about T&uuml;rkiye and Turks because of  these terrible scenes blame them.  In my opinion, these scenes were  exaggerated and especially included racism, so it does not depend on the  art principles that are to be international and uniting the nations.  Therefore, I can say that if I were Alan Parker with his knowledge and  experiments, I would make a better job for art and humanity than this  movie.
____If I were Alan Parker, firstly I would start to change this  wrong thesis of the movie that 'This movie was adapted from a real story'  (?) because Billy Hayes, has the true story, said that this movie had been  changed a lot and exaggerated very much to make more effective.  So I ask  you that if I had not done that, how could I have been realistic and having  common sense director or human?  Secondly, I would continue to change the  general atmosphere that all of the people in the movie apart from main  character are sadist because this opinion causes to many prejudices about a  nation, Turks and this is not realistic.  So I would show the prison as  extremely instead of showing everything any parts of T&uuml;rkiye.  As you know,  every country can have these unexpected events but certain they are not  general because there is no systems whose aims are to hurt humans.  So I  would have caught a good point for discussing some prisons in T&uuml;rkiye.  Perhaps many actors and actress would have helped me to make the movie and  I could have used the real Turks on the movie instead of their fakes.  In  my opinion, that would have been more effective, more realistic and more  useful.  Thirdly, I would have used some of good character in Turks and  emphasize again that all Turks are not bad people, they have some problems  like all nations.  So I would have behaved universally and not do injustice  to lots of people live and lived friendly and fraternally in Anatolia.  Fourthly, perhaps the most important thing, I would have been sorry for  making mistakes because I could not have done all of them and turn my  movie, full of the prejudices and racism, to more objective and humanistic  way.
____In my opinion, all of the people whose goals are to be universal  and uniting of whole humanity like art's would make better if they were  Alan Parker.  They never hurt any other nations in the world, Turks and  whose unique leader, Atat&uuml;rk who says 'Peace at home, peace in the world'  and presented April 23, written date of this essay, to all children in the  world as a symbol of peace and friendship.",956880000,20,3233,4.613074204946996
15516,5,0767817486,"First of all, I don't believe that a filmmaker should compromise their beliefs purely to avoid annoying a certain group of people. Certainly, Midnight Express does no favours to Turkey and I notice that, not  surprisingly, a lot of Turkish people are upset about this. However, most  people would agree that this kind of treatment of any prisoner, especially  who is not a hardened criminal but a misguided youth, is simply  unacceptable. And then to change the sentence after the trial... Don't get  me wrong - other countries, even the UK, have done this, but I don't  believe the accusations of racism are founded - nobody should draw back  from criticising any country just because they might be called racist;  although it is based on a true story it is not always true to that story -  the liberties which are taken are there to dramaticise events, not to  encite racism. The biggest problem comes when people try to claim that none  of this happened and that it doesn't represent the real Turkey - well, some  or even most of it did happen, and of course it doesn't represent the real  Turkey - it's simply a dramatic and extremely well made film. Of course  it's biased and there is nothing at all wrong with that - it's a film, not  a documentary, after all. The film features some great performances,  particularly from Brad Davis and John Hurt, a taut and well-written story  by Oliver Stone, and an excellent soundtrack from Giorgio Moroder, which  matches the on-screen events suitably.",956361600,5,1499,4.744186046511628
15517,3,0767817486,"On a cinematic level, Midnight Express is an extremely powerful movie.  It has a terrific, moving soundtrack.  The acting is terrific.  The late Brad Davis, who played the lead in this film, threw away what could have been a  fantastic acting career because of his own drug use.  (The actor was pretty  much blackballed after he gained a reputation for showing up to Hollywood  parties and  film shootings stoned.  He eventually died of AIDS.)  Some of  the speeches in the film are extremely powerful.  However, the main  character is simply put, a drug smuggler who got caught.  The movie does an  excellent job of making him extremely sympathetic.  If you purchase the  newest edition, there's a brief documentary on the real life Billy Hayes.  I find his general lack of remorse most interesting.  Additionally, the  movie takes some liberties with the facts.  From what I understand, the  first half of the film is fairly accurate.  He did caught smuggling drugs  out of turkey.  He was sent to prison.  He did get his feet beaten with a  club, and was hit in the groin with the club.  (He was not raped, as many  reviewers have indicated.)  When he had less than two months left on his  sentence, he was sentenced to more time.  However, it wasn't another 30  years, like the movie indicates.  Between time off for good behavior, a  partial amnesty to all prisoners, and time served from his first sentence,  Billy Hayes had roughly 3 years left when he escaped.  The extreme  brutality in the last third of the film is simply the product of Oliver  Stone's imagination.  In fact, Billy Hayes has said that he'd like to make  another movie to properly reflect what really happened.  (Personally, I  think he's just trying to profit more from his crime.) Many reviewers have  complained about the brutal way the prisons are portrayed.  This movie is  certainly exaggerated.  However, prisons are brutal places.  Additionally,  the Turks do beat prisoners on the feet.  As another reviewer commented,  it's worse than the U.S., but not as bad as other countries.  I'd like to  refer you to a previous customer review in which the reviewer hypothesizes  what would have had happened if he hadn't been caught.",955843200,18,2211,4.801075268817204

15520,5,0767817486,"Yes, everyone is entitled an opinion. This is a story or Billy Hayes who got caught trying to smuggle hash out of Turkey. Yes, he got caught and yes, he was punished. Should the punishment fit the crime? I don't think  that the punishment fit the crime.  I don't think that this movie was  bashing any country in general. It let us know that one country's  definition of crime and punishment may differ from another.  Rent or buy  this movie---watch it a couple of times---did the punishment fit the crime?  He was initially sentenced to 5 years-his case was then reviewed 3 years  later and he was sentenced to 20 years. Isn't this punishment in itself?  The fact that they could ""play with his sentence"" and punish him  for the same crime more than once.  I think that Billy paid his dues by  just knowing this fact.  This move defines the meaning of MERCY.",953683200,7,859,4.5

A ""must see"", which grabs your attention from the very first minute, with its extraordinary sense of realism, and a good DVD image quality (dubble sided  disc, for two aspect ratio's. Nice idea) But what made this movie so well  known even amongs those who never got around to see it, is its famous, and  highly original sound track, made very succesfull issue as LP (and the  later CD). That is where the DVD dissapoints.

The actors used in the film as Turkish authority are not Turkish which is the  worst part of the movie. If you are going to make film based on a true  story , you must do it properly first! This film could not have achieved  its goal , no , it shows Turkey as Iran which is not. I accept that there  were many things which were wrong in Turkey 20-30 years ago but the film is  especiialy puts Turkey like an Arabian country , all in dust and every  thing. I think Oliver Stone should put his hand on his heart and must think  what he has done 25 years ago.",951523200,10,700,3.9148936170212765
15523,5,0767817486,Mignight express is a great movie. I don't thimk that it exaggerates a lot because we all know what was happening in Turkey some 20-30 years ago. If you havn't seen it buy or at least rent it.,951004800,5,192,4.078947368421052
15524,4,0767817486,"This was my first time seeing the movie, and I didn't read the book, although now I plan to. I found the movie fascinating and also difficult to watch for long periods. I had to leave the room a few times for several  minutes before I resumed watching. I don't think I'd want to go through the  horror and gut-wrenching experience of seeing it again, but I'm glad I did  at least once. It was unlike anything I'd ever watched.
The reviews that  dismissed the movie simply because they believe it casts a bad light on  Turkey are missing the point. Is the tale true or not? It's nearly  impossible to refute anyone's personal experience unless you've gone  through the same thing. By the way, I was in Istanbul and other parts of  Turkey last year as a tourist, and while the country is the most physically  stunning I've ever seen and the  individual Turks I met were kind, I didn't  care for the culture and I can remember thinking I wouldn't want to be on  the wrong side of authorities there.",947980800,5,995,4.406593406593407
15525,2,0767817486,"OK, if you can sympathize with an idiot who would strap several kilos of hash to his body to smuggle them from a country where penalties for such crimes are often met with DEATH, then you can go with this slick,  atmospheric and incredibly violent movie.  Admittedly, it gets under your  skin, and Brad Davis was mightily effective in the role of Billy Hayes, and  John Hurt embodies creepily the stoned out prison mate Billy befriends  during his harrowing odyssey.  But this movie, directed with typical  stylish flair by visual master Alan Parker, never places the blame squarely  on Billy's shoulders, poor dumb guy.  And while his torturous stay in the  Turkish prisons practically smells, it is so dense and well-captured, it  did nothing for the image of Turkey, the country -- it is uncompromising  and brutally vicious in its depiction of virtually every Turkish location,  character and idea, for that matter.  If Turkey was such a pit of despair,  why did Billy decide to buy his hash there?  This movie revolves around a  character who is unrepentant and foolish, and while no one should have to  endure such human indignation, it is hard to escape that simple fact.  Parker's movie, taken on its own terms, has an almost poetic quality at  times, though Billy's dismissal of the Swede's advances actually made me  laugh out loud, and, by the way, was consummated in the book.  With so much  depravity at every turn, and hellish imprisonment your destiny, why  wouldn't Billy seek another human, even if he happens to be a man?",945993600,18,1539,4.8084291187739465

The first half hour of the film  is great movie making. When he tries to smuggle the hashish,gets  caught,thrown in prison. As I kept watching I couldn't keep thinking of all  the rascism directed towards Turkish people. There's not even one nice  Turkish person in the film. In the end I found the film biased, racist, and  not even engrossing because honestly,I did not feel sorry for the main  character. I heard that half of the factuality in the film was exaggerated  and twisted for dramatic effect. I returned the film the next day.

15558,4,0767817486,"Finally got around to seeing this and was very impressed.  The story is compelling, the performances are excellent, and the score is haunting, but ultimately it is Stone's tight, effective screenplay that makes this movie  work so well.  No, it does not give a very favorable impression of the  Turkish people, but given the circumstances of the prisons there at this  time, it is probably realistic.  The ""pigs"" courtroom speech is  absolutely true to how Hayes would have felt at that point.  A perceptive  viewer would understand the context of his speech and assume that in  reality not all Turks are pigs.  Context is everything.  Ultimately,  though, that doesn't have much to do with the point of the movie.
