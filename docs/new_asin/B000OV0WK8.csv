8389462,5,B000OV0WK8,"This DVD gives you so much more than a regular concert. You get sneak-previews of many beautiful songs, a few complete songs in videos, the pre-concert's arrangements, and then the complete repertoire which is extraordinaire.
Jorge Rojas' voice is simply beautiful, flawless, full of strength and passion as he interprets his music.
Jorge is native of Argentina, he is the author of most of the songs he sings but he also interprets other song writers' creations in majestic performance.
I recommend all, not only Spanish speaking, music lovers to add Jorge Rojas to their collection and be filled with genuine joy for life and love. Knowing his life will change you into a better person. Get this DVD as a foretaste, then get all his works as a must, you won't want to not have some of his released works.
