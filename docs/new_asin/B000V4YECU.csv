This DVD is worth every penny!

The babies are cute too.

2929206,5,B000V4YECU,"This DVD is GREAT because it let's me see Helen in action (also lets me hear what she means in ENGLISH - I'm in Japan). She's really clear about what to do and what not to do concerning the age or infants. She has sections maked ""Yoga for newborns"" and yoga for the older babies. After watching a baby massage seminar here in Japan and then watching her dvd, I can see a clear difference (and sometimes overlap) between baby yoga and baby massage. I also recommend her book Itsy Bitsy Yoga as a vital supplement to use with the dvd. Reason being a lot of valubale information and explanations about the poses she does in the dvd is in the book and not the dvd.

Hope this helps

2929207,5,B000V4YECU,"I had done Itsy Bitsy Yoga with my first child and was unable to go with my second so I was so happy to get the video.  This video was great for both the newborn and the older baby.  My child was in the Newborn part and when she saw the baby on the tape she started talking to her and then when she heard her name on the name singing she was laughing and standing in front of the TV.  This was such a great way to bond with my children and connect with them.  My older son still does the yoga poses and when he saw his sister he took her hands and said ""I love baby"" like her learned in Itsy bitsy. i waold recommend this to all new moms",1190937600,,637,3.7669172932330826

8216440,1,B000V4YECU,"I was so excited when I got this as I loved mommy and me yoga classes in person. This DVD got used maybe twice. There is a ton of annoying talking among the moms and yoga lady and it was no fun for me or my son to sit through it or fast forward through each time. Unfortunately, this one had the best reviews of those on amazon. I suppose it could be useful to sit through once and write down the moves then do them on your own, but surely that could be done easier searching the web for moves. Don't waste your money.",1347148800,,518,3.942857142857143
8216441,3,B000V4YECU,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, there's just too much down time in this DVD.  When you cut out all the commentary from other mothers, there's a grand total of 15 minutes of actual yoga.  I don't want to have to sit and listen to moms introducing their babies and telling about their fussy times of the day every time I sit down to watch the DVD.  I definitely enjoy the routine once we finally get down to it, but I decided to type out the routine and print it out so we can put on our own music and move it along without so much down time between the sections.",1296086400,,566,4.127272727272727
8216442,2,B000V4YECU,"I love the Itsy Bitsy Yoga concept and take classes by a Helen Garabadian trained teacher here in DC so I thought I would love here DVDs.  But after buying two Helen Garabadian DVDs I discovered that basically you were getting 11 minutes of yoga routines on each DVD and I was pretty disappointed. She provides variations on the same program for toddlers, for a class of infants and a ""bonus dvd"" which was just a one baby version of the same class offered, I felt a bit ripped off. Helen could have easily combined the two videos into one DVD and it still would barely be enough to merit a video or [...] bucks. It takes almost as much time to put the DVD in and fast forward the repetative intros as it does to do the whole routine. I do love the routines, but I certainly expected more for my money. It takes almost as much time to put the DVD in and fast forward the repetative intros as it does to do the whole routine. Also there was very little discussion of technique and or benefits of the different poses.",1255824000,11,1015,4.259067357512953
8216443,4,B000V4YECU,there are many good poses and playful interactions  you can add to your bag of mommy tricks.  my newborn doesn't always tolerate doing a whole routine at a time so we just incorporate poses into  our day and changing time.  divine drops truly is magic!,1251158400,,252,4.533333333333333
8216444,3,B000V4YECU,"The video has a set of routines for groups, newborns and the lone mom, but they are all the same, so if you plan on going through the entire video, it will get a little repetative.  There are also lots of comments from moms about why they love baby yoga which I found long and unnessary; kind of like an in video advertisement.  That said I did like the routine and found the content very age appropriate for my child and I have had trouble finding dvds that fit this bill for children under 6 months.",1249948800,,501,4.208333333333333
8216445,1,B000V4YECU,"This yoga dvd requires you to hold your baby and move them back and forth from one arm to the other. Now... my baby is around 15 lbs. Having to move her back and forth from one arm to the other is very tiring. I hold her enough as it is and it wears me out [all new moms should know what I am talking about]. I turned this dvd on once and that was the last time I touched it. DO NOT PURCHASE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1238716800,,416,3.7386363636363638
8216446,5,B000V4YECU,"I absolutely love this video! I did Itsy Bitsy Yoga with my daughter using Helen's book, and she just loved all of the poses. They really helped us during any fussy moments. I bought the DVD to watch Helen in action do some of the poses in her book, and it was so helpful for us! My daughter loves to watch it even when she's not doing yoga. We loved it so much we found a class to attend. This is such a great program for all mothers with babies/tots and especially great to bond with your baby. It is my new idea for a shower gift!",1220400000,,533,3.9906542056074765
8216447,5,B000V4YECU,"Starting yoga for myself before my second child was born, I discovered its many benefits (don't want to get into this, but you can research & read for yourself) & was excited to find out about the Itsy Bitsy Yoga classes for children.  I did the live classes with my second child, used Helen's book for my third child (which I also highly recommend), and now am using this great DVD for my fourth!  After all, one can only afford to pay for so many yoga classes :) (although they are definately worth it).  I like the DVD, as I am visual, and I feel like I am back in the live class.  What's also great is it has sections for newborns & those for older babies.  Provides great bonding for you & your child--recommend for new mommies & even experienced ones.  Looking forward to getting the book for my toddlers & can't wait for a toddler DVD to come out!  (Helen, are you reading this?)",1216425600,3,886,4.301204819277109
8216448,4,B000V4YECU,"I bought this because I like to do yoga and I thought it would be a good way to get in shape and play with my newborn son at the same time. While I don't get a workout for myself, I have found that it's wonderful for my son! Whenever he starts to get fussy, we do a few of the exercises and he calms right down.",1203292800,2,311,3.656716417910448
