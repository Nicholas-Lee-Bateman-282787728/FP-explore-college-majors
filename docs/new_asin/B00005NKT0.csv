1635093,3,B00005NKT0,"Guilty, guilty, the guiltiest of pleasures. I have to admit (and I'm not in any way shape or form proud of this) I love this movie. Yeah, the plot is contrived. The acting, when it isn't over the top is almost painfully stilted and forced but it is just great fun. However, on the up side, Gail O'Grady spends half the movie in a tight fitting swim suit.

Don't expect a masterpiece. This movie is straight off the Lifetime Movie Channel so, of course, the schmuck husband (Midkiff) is a no damn good cheating liar. This guy has almost no redeeming qualities at all. And his stupidly transparent efforts to juggle a clingy wife (O'Grady) and his new girlfriend (Rinna) are so inept you just can't help but get sucked in.

This movie is good fun to watch, especially on a rainy weekend when you have an hour or two to kill.",1154649600,26,822,4.401315789473684

I'm glad the two woman remain friends. not all woman would stop themselves if they were seeing their friends husband. but this woman (rhinna) didn't know and its not her fault.

1635104,4,B00005NKT0,"This is a better movie than I expected it to be.  Liso Rinna who has turned into  a sort of joke referred to as ""fish mouth"" over the years actually does a good job in this movie. It is before he lips took over her face totally.  It's a good story about two women who meet and become friends.  Both of them have trauma of different kinds in their childhood .  The man in question, the husband of one and the boyfriend of the other just seems to have gotten caught in a situation that could not possibly work out well.  I had to admire the fact that he was trying to get out of the marriage and she was just clinging like a suction cup. By the time she finds herself mostly thanks to the new friend, she no longer can abide being in the marriage and the woman he'd also lied to wouldn't have him either.  I think it's really good that a movie could end where the man has to go off by himself and the two women still have each other.  It was a good movie.",1407974400,2,953,3.9789473684210526
1635105,4,B00005NKT0,"I just love a good LIFETIME movie (the network for women.... Who hate men. Hah!)  This movie is just like all the others on LMN, slightly cheesy, but entertaining, nonetheless.  Good for those girls nights or lazy Sunday afternoon movie marathons.",1404172800,,247,5.0

1635108,4,B00005NKT0,"Laurel (Lisa Rinna), a psychologist, has finally decided to confront her paralyzing fear of swimming and enrolls in lessons with Susan (Gail O'Grady), a swim instructor at the community center.

Laurel & Susan become fast friends as they share their dreams and secrets with each other--as Laurel learns to swim, Susan learns to face her crumbling marriage head-on, but unfortunately they face the ultimate test in friendship when they discover they share something else: the same man.",1390521600,,484,5.285714285714286
1635109,5,B00005NKT0,"Saw this movie on the lifetime channel years ago.. All three of the main actors play excellent rolls..

1635111,5,B00005NKT0,"Once again, Lifetime proves that their movie collection is much better than Showtime's--which you pay handsomely for. Exs Include: This movie, Going Broke or [for] Broke(starring Delta Burke), Wicked Minds(Angie Everheart), The Craiglist Killer, Everything She Ever Wanted(Gina Gershon ),Unthinkable, The one where a manipulative man controls his sister-in-law and daughter for his own selfish purposes(getting the daughter to kill his wife and raping and later marrying his former sister-in-law), the one where Jennie Garth had AIDs, the one where the Big Bang Theory's  Cuomo--the tastefully sexy jockette--is playing a fat girl for a classroom project and for her own issues she has with her family, etc. There are so many. Often times, they allow you to look and see what not to do or wonder how in the world people can mess their lives up that way. There are also twisted and thrilling movies. There are true movies. Also, the type of movie is many times better than Showtime plus all of them are watchable with your 13 year old. You don't have the movies distributed by the big time production companies--which do not offer Denzel; Gibson; Russell; Van Damme, Snipes, Superhero; horror; etc., but you get family movies in return and don't have to worry as much about blocking them.

A man--in which life comes too easy for and in which life is really good for--gets bored with what he has. His wife(Gail O'Grady) is really beautiful and--in modern times--is the equivalent of June Cleaver all wrapped into one. On top of all this, she works as a swimming instructor, so she has sexual prowess, too. All the mental and emotional qualities that make her a good wife make her boring to some. Roxy, her mother--who has always felt entitled as a mother due to simply giving birth--makes her shell house size. That's her only unfixable problem in a woman a good man wants as a wife and it rubs him the wrong way. So, he opts for the woman that is every thing that she's not. Looking at the other woman--shrink by trade--she would make someone a good wife, but she's not as good of a woman as his wife. He lies to this woman about his name(an important detail later on) and some other details, too. It's not clear at first to her, though, and she accepts his Bahaman trip offer. If it was not for the facts that her little brother drowned when she was just a little girl; she's been scared of swimming ever since; and she wants to swim for her trip, she would never have met her beau 's wife. Opposites attract and they become really good friends, while one relationship crumbles and the other sizzles. The irony is that it's the same man. The other woman doesn't even know that he's married, bc he lied to her what his name is. If she knew that his name was Johnny, she would have known. By this point and via his own choice, he's virtually separated from his wife and something causes him to do a 180(my guess is that he had to fess up to some of those lies that he's told and figured that she wasn't going to have him). Anyway, his uxorious doormat is waiting to catch him and they make up. They're back together when the 3 are together at church and the other woman leaves, knowing finally who he really is! He finally knows the tandem's friendship. The wife doesn't know yet about their relationship, though. A chance encounter when she finds a picture of them together changes everything; now, she knows who the other woman is. Her life crashes around her. Unbeknownst to her--her new friend offered her some great probono shrink work in her life, bc she is stronger now than ever before. Therefore, they were helping each other. She stands up to Johnny and her neglecting mother, Roxy. She's free and that's not the end, but it's good for this kind of movie! 5 Stars Out of 5.",1359504000,,3782,4.618127786032689

1635115,5,B00005NKT0,"This is a wonderful movie about true friendships and empowering yourself (as a woman) to stand up for yourself. Lisa Rinna does as excellent job a a psych and a friend by giving Gayle O'Grady the power to stand up for herself against her non-loving poor excuse for a mother and give her the courage to walk away from a loveless marriage. The friendship is put to the test but when a friend is true, its just like true love, it conquers all. This is a must see for all women everywhere.",1272412800,4,485,4.282608695652174
1635116,5,B00005NKT0,"I found the relationship between Gail O'Grady's character and Lisa Renna's character
to be highly erotic. Most people will see this film as a boy meets girl, girl meet boy,
they fall in love, he cheats, she confides in best friend and..........I can't give
away the rest of the film. Sorry.",1266796800,,290,4.705882352941177

7947416,2,B00005NKT0,"Just saw this movie on tv and had to vent. Gail O' Grady and Lisa Rinna give typical performances,but the storyline is terrible. What I believe is meant to be the standard fare about a devoted wife and a cheating spouse ACTUALLY comes off as a husband stuck with an emotionally unavailable wife who expects her hubby to wade through that mess and read her mind. Gail O' Brady's character is combative,sullen and hostile,and while the viewer gets insight into why she has self esteem issues,you can't exactly blame Dale Midkiff for wandering. Lisa Rinna's character is not so much the other woman as the woman who had no idea anything was wrong until hubby felt guilty. She did the right thing by ending it once she knew he was still married,and felt it was better if her friend never knew what happened. Even when faced with the revelation that her husband had cheated on her with her friend, the wife refuses to accept that the friend was just as much deceived. SPOILER ALERT! The end was just some dry declarations of independence that the wife could have made any time over the years by taking stock of her own bad attitude. Sure it's a lifetime movie and you don't expect Masterpiece Theater or anything, but inconsistencies made this one die on the table.",1447804800,,1260,4.629464285714286
