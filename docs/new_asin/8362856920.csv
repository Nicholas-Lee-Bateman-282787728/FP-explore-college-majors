7901093,4,8362856920,"colorful quirky romantic comedy about an ugly duckling woman who wonders thru Nagasaki thinking of Lisbon - filled with manga inspired dreams of princes and princesses and romance - and yearning for the attractive man who once said something encouraging to her

well acted - especially by Miki Nakatani as the duckling who we watch evolve - i gave the film an extra star becuz of her

funnily - its set during the Christmas season and the soundtrack is full of Xmas music sung in English - the only odd note coming at a wedding scene with the bride and father marching down the aisle to ""O Christmas Tree""

it starts out fast paced - but slows appropriately as the emotions deepen - the plot turns more conventional towards the end - but by then - the spell had been cast",1314230400,,771,4.453900709219858
