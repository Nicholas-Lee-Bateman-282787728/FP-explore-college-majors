2652873,5,B000I3ONLG,Good family show.  It is about life and choices which is a good show to have discussions on.,1439596800,,92,4.111111111111111

2652876,5,B000I3ONLG,I have always loved Jane Seymore in the Dr Quinn series. Its also a very wholesome movie as well. One that you can sit down with the whole family and not worry about being embarrassed about certain parts.,1331251200,2,204,4.394736842105263
2652877,5,B000I3ONLG,"I'm so sad that I have completed the show, because now I have nothing good to watch. I loved how it was clean and family friendly, but didn't hesitate to talk about problems or situations within family life. This show made me worry, cry and laugh with the actors. After every single episode, I wanted to watch another one (sometimes I did  watch more than 1,2, or 3 in a row). I absolutely recommend this show!",1500508800,,410,4.394736842105263
2652878,5,B000I3ONLG,"Perfect for pre-teen girls!

I LOVED this show growing up but now that I've watched it as an adult, I can see how it shaped my perception of family values, and strong, honorable women.  I have two boys now and their interest was a little piqued as they saw me watching as well... Good stuff!",1499990400,,291,4.2727272727272725
2652879,5,B000I3ONLG,"I would just like to say I Like Dr. Quinn and her show , but IT IS A SHOW ! I have read reviews about people saying how we as America stole the lands from the Indians. THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH TO THAT ! The reason I'm writing this review is to let people know that the main cause of the Indians death and disappearance was when Columbus and the Spain settlers landed in central America and began to spread the measles within the Indian tribes. Then when the English settlers came to north America they spread the measles as well. This killed over 80% of the Indian population , and it was accidental not genocide because the Indians had no immune defense to this disease. Now, I will state that Columbus  did some things to certain Indians down in central America such as enslave them, massacre them, and take things from them, but not on the same level that we did. He went way to far; he was trying to get things with conquest. I will admit as well that we shouldn't have done some of the things that we did to them such as, make them march the trail off tears, to move west, and in some cases our army did some things that they shouldn't , but if you look back; the different tribes stole land and fought amongst  each other. They would massacre each other for land and power. They would practice the conquest ethic ,whichever  tribe was more powerful would conquer the others. We gave the Indians reservations. They could be prosperous and build stores or farm, or continue there way of life like they still can today. WE were very generous to the  Indians and not cruel to them all the time there even were men fighting in congress for them such as David Crockett. So, I hope you do your homework , like me , and really get the facts of history. America is a great nation and country and people need to read there history book to find what really happened. I enjoy Dr. Quinn ,But, I still keep in mind that it is a TV SHOW FOR ENTERTAINMENT. Thank you if you read this I hope you enjoyed it.",1490400000,,2007,4.2460732984293195
2652880,5,B000I3ONLG,My family & I Absolutely love the complete series. Lifes Trials & Tribulations packed into all seasons and very well done. So sad to see it end.,1487721600,,144,4.37037037037037
2652881,5,B000I3ONLG,This was a very welcome change to all the trash on tv now a days.,1477612800,,65,3.4
2652882,5,B000I3ONLG,"This season (6) was one of the better ones, not that the others were bad.  Overall the show has stood the test of time. More dramatic episodes in season six was something that kept me interested.  It was nice not having Sully in every episode.  Nothing against the character...well that's not true.  I think his character is so unbelivable.  While the show continuously vents it liberal views, changing history as it does, it's usually done with good taste.  After all its a tv/movie entertainment show and it is entertaining.  A few liberties are allowed.  Except the ridiculous Sully character.  So as I said, it was good having a break from him this season.",1464998400,,660,4.769911504424779
2652883,5,B000I3ONLG,"You know, television isn't like this anymore.  I remember watching this show when it aired in the 90's and didn't fully understand the stregnth of the episodes.  Great acting and storytelling.  Quite refreshing.",1460246400,,211,5.333333333333333

2652890,5,B000I3ONLG,"As the series last season I was struck by how much I enjoyed being with the people of Colorado Springs.  This season did not leave me hanging as it ended, but I did want to hear more.
The writing was wonderful and the actors made the characters seem alive.
It is a wholesome series for the whole family and I strongly recommend it to all.",1448236800,6,338,4.2

2652896,5,B000I3ONLG,"I enjoyed the six seasons of this series and the two movies that followed.  I especially liked the comment feature at the end of some episodes in which the events of a particular episode are tied in with real historical facts such as the voting rights for women, evolution from stage coach travel cross country to trains, updating of medical procedures like a tracheostomy, how lands were systematically stolen from the Indians, Indians purposely given disease-carrying blankets, etc.  Excellent show with interesting characters.",1447891200,2,529,5.36144578313253

2652898,5,B000I3ONLG,"Great series.  I watched every episode of all six seasons.  Nice to see a clean family friendly series, you don't have many.

2652902,4,B000I3ONLG,Dr. Quinn took a hit the last season. Sully was not highlighted in many episodes.  The show was ending because CBS would not allow any more seasons so many things had to be crammed into one season. Still a great family TV show.,1447632000,2,227,4.27906976744186

2652904,4,B000I3ONLG,This continues to be a good family show. The plot lines are starting to run a bit thin and starting to feel as if the writers are running out of ideas. The new age mind set is becoming more noticeable which puts me off quite a bit. There are two times when I turned off the show due to the heavy atmosphere of new age thinking.,1446940800,,327,3.9696969696969697
