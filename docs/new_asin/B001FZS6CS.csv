8303182,5,B001FZS6CS,"What can I say? To me Gene Barry was one of the best dozen actors of the era.

  He was casted perfectly for the roll of Bat Masterson, and when it aired in Australia I knew the title song by heart (still do) and never missed an episode.

  Dispointed that the boxset was only TV copies, but I'm glad to be able to see the show again after all these years.

  The way that Bat wore his gun on his waist instead of his hip made the character very intresting, but in real life, I always belived Bat wasn't very fast on-the-draw, that is why he used the cane most of the time.",1292889600,,573,4.0
