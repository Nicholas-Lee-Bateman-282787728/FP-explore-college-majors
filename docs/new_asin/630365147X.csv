707995,4,630365147X,"Goldfinger is the third film in the Bond series and starring Sean Connery. Goldfinger just may be the most exciting Bond adventure. It has its full of heart pounding action and humor. It also has some very good music in it.  Sean Connery is excellent in it as 007. Also it has one the very best of  the Bond enemies in it Oddjob. He is truly evil, but he is likable evil. He  is a great character in this film. If you want Bond it doesn;t get much  better than this.",934502400,,466,4.087912087912088
707996,5,630365147X,"Only the sound quality is not comparable to more modern movies - probably due to master audio limitations.  However, the DVD when viewed on a 50 inch projection via S jack - has extraordinary sharpness and color - faithfully  recreating the original movie experience - once only available for those  fortunate enough to have seen this movie in its original form back almost  35 yrs ago.
Let the critics rave about FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE as an art  form.  Sorry but GOLDFINGER is the essence of James Bond. In fact -  GOLDFINGER athough number 3 in the lineup - is the breakaway hit that made  the James Bond Series a world wide phenomenon.
When Jill Matterson  (Shirley Eaton), perched high above the Fontainbleu Hotel swimming pool, -  says to Bond ""and who are you?"" and Connery replies ""Bond,  James Bond"" -  THAT IS BOND in all its glory.

707997,5,630365147X,"""Goldfinger"" offers us the best of everything: the best Bond (Sean Connery, in his best performance as 007); the best villain, Auric Goldfinger, with the best plan: namely, setting off an atomic bomb in the  bowels of Fort Knox, destroying Western economy for decades and increasing  the value of his own hoard of gold.  Oddjob (Harold Sakata) is the best of  the villain henchmen seen in the series, with his deadly derby hat. Bond's  Aston Martin DB-5 (""With modifications,"" as Q so eloquently  understates) is the best of all the Bond cars to date, as well as the most  stylish.  Honor Blackman is irresistable as Pussy Galore, with the most  obviously suggestive of all the Bond girl names.

The second half is so shockingly bad that it belongs on MST3K.  From such gaffes as Bond electrocuting one piece of metal to kill a person holding another, to consistency errors between cuts, to terrible pacing and overall directing, the second half of the movie detracts far too much from the first half to recommend.  If you do decide to watch it you will roll your eyes so frequently that they may fall out.  It was difficult to get through because it was just so poorly directed.

How did Pussy Galore have time or knowledge of the technology involved to switch the gas to a different gas that would enable the U.S. infantry surrounding Fort Knox to wake up? And are we to believe that one spectacular roll in the (literal) hay with 007 was sufficient to effect a total reversal of both her personal agenda and personality?

What needs to be cautioned is that the Sean Connery version of James Bond is sexually aggressive. This is disappointing/ frustrating to see. What the character does is wrong in how he ""convinces"" women of his charm. Be aware of this beforehand when you watch it with anyone who is younger and impressionable.

708237,4,630365147X,"By the last couple of decades of the 20th century and into the first decades of the 21st century, action films became the highest grossing offerings from Hollywood. Prior to circa 1960, period dramas were more often the pictures which brought movie-goers into the theater seats with their popcorn: ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"", etc. A few action-suspense films, such as those directed by Alfred Hitchcock and film noir, did also bring in the box office bucks. Westerns were probably the most prevalent action movie prior to James Bond but many of them were lower-budgeted B-films. In 1956, the only action movie among the top-10 grossing films was ""The Searchers"", a western starring John Wayne. All others in the top-10 were epic period pictures and dramas. However, by circa 2000, the reigning king of film genres became the action film. By 2014, 50 years later, all the top-10 grossing films were action-oriented including science fiction, fantasy and/or superhero. Unlike decades gone by, the highest-grossing films and best picture winners are almost never the same.

The original James Bond films of the 1960's, particularly ""Goldfinger"", paved the way and included so many of the elements currently found in the genre. Firstly, the James Bond films were the first action films outside of detective films/series and Westerns to feature a recurring character in multiple offerings. Secondly, much of the genre's formula was established with ""Goldfinger"" and other Connery-Bond installments. The action doesn't begin with the main plot but instead begins with Bond engaged in another mission as a kind of ""prelude"" to the main story. This device has been used ever since ad infinitum, such as in some of the later Die Hard films with Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) which began in the late 1980's and even up to the Mission Impossible films starring Tom Cruise in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Thirdly, Bond makes little funny comments which has become such a trademark in entertainment action films. Often these comments are in the wake of a kill. For example, in ""Dr. No"", Bond kills a man with a bow and arrow and says, ""I think he got the point.""

""Goldfinger"" became the second-highest grossing film of 1964 behind ""My Fair Lady"" and is probably one of the two best Connery/Bond films, the other ""From Russia with Love"". The plot is typical of many of the Bond stories: a kingpin criminal magnate, called simply Goldfinger, is suspected of smuggling large amounts of gold out of first-world nations and possibly reselling it to third world nations who pay more. (This couldn't happen today since international markets constantly track the price of gold.) James Bond (Sean Connery), Agent 007, is sent on a mission to find out about Goldfinger (Gert Frbe). Turns out he's vacationing at the same hotel in Miami Beach as Bond! Then Bond turns up at a golf course where Goldfinger just happens to be playing. The informal gold, I mean golf competition, is worth the price of admission alone.

The trail leads to a complex in Switzerland where Bond finds out about an operation called ""Grand Slam"". Bond doesn't know what Grand Slam is but is apprehended by the baddies in which Bond is shackled to a table and going to be sliced into pieces for 007 sandwiches by a laser. Bond must find out the nature of Goldfinger's scheme, but if he doesn't somehow get off the table, it will be Bond mince pies. Eventually he also meets Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), a beautiful blond who knows automatic weapons, judo and airplane flying. She is part of Goldfinger's operation for the money and immune to Bond's ""charms"".

A very enjoyable installment in the Bond canon and does uphold relatively well. Some of the sequences were a bit unbelievable by today's standards, such as Goldfinger puts only one guard on Bond initially. Of course the guard is not given reinforcements and Bond easily subdues him! (Goldfinger should be smart enough to use a lot more manpower to guard a hired assassin!) Although we may expect a bit more from action pictures (or may we don't!), the Bond cycle was the original blueprint which has influenced so many action films for over the next half-century. The series itself has continued at this writing with Daniel Craig as 007, for my money the best Bond since Connery. Still the Connery-Bond installments still provide good escapist entertainment. Pass the popcorn.",1504569600,,4426,4.960916442048518

708271,4,630365147X,"Goldfinger (1964)  the third in the James Bond series and the third to star Sean Connery as an MI6 agent.  It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman  and Gert Frbe as the villain Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was directed by Guy Hamilton.

Bond is investigating gold smuggling by gold guru Auric Goldfinger and eventually learns of Goldfinger's plans to contaminate the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox,  called ""Operation Grand Slam.""  Photography took place from January to July 1964 in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the US states of Kentucky and Florida.

The release of the film led to the promotion of several offshoots including a toy Aston Martin DB5.  The Aston Martin DB5 in the film is uparmored by Bond's armorer from Q section  and is stunning.  Also, of gold-painted Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson appeared on the cover of Life Magazine.

Much of the formula in the film appeared in subsequent James Bond films, such gadgets used by Bonds,  and pre-credit artscapes not part of the main storyline,  foreign locations, and dry humor.  What interested me the most is Goldfinger's attempts to financially hamstring the U.S. for his own gain and his use of Chinese worker bees.  It seems somewhat similar to two adversarial countries in East Asia today and their unhelpful actions towards the US today.",1503532800,,1484,4.92741935483871

708274,5,630365147X,"Yes, my love for Honor Blackman is the only reason I purchased this.
This is an exhilarating film made during the time of cinema storytelling without perverse and tiresome CGI.
The freedom of contemporary technology seems to have eased the pursuit of spying in the year 1964.
There are a number of great attractions in this film, a beautiful woman painted gold who unconvincingly dies from it, a ruthless Korean henchman named Oddjob with a trick killer hat, a gadget filled Aston Martin supercar, a plot to wreck the American economy masterminded by a German and Chinese nationals (imagine that) and the Pussy Galore Flying Circus!
The Galore character, I believe, was an essential spearhead for the Sexual Revolution and the Feminist Movement.
But this started of course with The Avengers' Cathy Gale.
Only the exquisite Honor Blackman could find a new way to alter stereotypical perceptions.
In fact I feel she was just being honest, an authentic person.
Her onscreen presence is overwhelming, everyone else just falls away.
The success of The Avengers, series 2 & 3 was more than enough for Blackman to be cast as Pussy Galore, a mainstream cinema milestone.
I think it's interesting that her and the actor Burt Kwouk (1930-2016) appeared in the final Cathy Gale episode of The Avengers, Lobster Quadrille and then here in Goldfinger.
This is a somewhat silly and cartoonishly sexist film overall but exhilaratingly fun!
The only real gold here is Honor Blackman, a tremendous talent and historical figure.

A lovely human being.

708337,5,630365147X,"The Bond movies from the 1960's, for the most part, achieved something later Bond films did not.  They stayed very close to the actual Bond novel of the same name.  Of all these movies, Goldfinger, was the closest to the novel.  In the novel, Goldfinger was going to actually steal the gold, but the bomb aspect made it more fun!  In the later years, the movie had little or nothing in common with the book.  Movies like The Living Daylights and Octopussy, took their titles from short stories, and not even novels!
If your interest is in history, these early Bond films, especially Goldfinger, take you back to a time of great innocence.  The cars, the actors, the stories, all take us back to a time, years ago.  The novels do as well.  They tend to get wordy, because they go into detail of times and surroundings that slow them down.  But from a historical standpoint, they give a background not seen today.  The same with the movies.  They shine a light (naturally bias) to the Cold War, and all the fears of that time.  Also, our morals show through in these movies, especially Goldfinger.  This film was rated M for Mature Audiances (before our current rating system).  Mature meant 21 or older.  Scenes like Jill in her underwear and in bed with Bond (after having sex, of course!), while tame today, were quite risque!  Bond's sexually charged comments were also too risque for underage viewers ( Bond to Felix, ""Dinner?  Oh sorry, SOMETHING BIG CAME UP).  These movies, and especially Goldfinger, are just fun to watch, and a great look into the adult life in the 1960's.",1487548800,,1581,4.625899280575539

Compared to today's action films the weapons, special effects, and fighting sequences are all simple, yet they work because the film as a whole is well constructed and the villain and his dastardly plan are quite brilliant (hint: physically stealing all of the world's gold isn't necessary to control it).

That said, here are two of the film's flaws that are really annoying to modern eyes:
1. Five small prop planes cannot disperse enough nerve gas over such a large, open-air target
2. Ian Flemming's insistence that the ""right man"" can seduce any woman, no matter her sexual orientation

And some of my favorite moments of the film:
1. Bond: ""Do you expect me to talk?""  Goldfinger: ""No Mr. Bond. I expect you to die!""
2. The lengths 007 has to go in order to shave in privacy
3. 007's mistakes get people killed and him captured. The best Bond films acknowledge the pathos that stems from all the collateral damage",1486771200,,1055,4.691891891891892

708779,5,630365147X,"Goldfinger is the gold standard for James Bond movies, to which all other Bond films should aspire to be. The structure of the film is perfect, it has the best villain of the franchise, the best Bond of the franchise and the best car of the franchise.

When most people think about James Bond, they think about Sean Connery in the 1960's, they think about vodka martini's being shaken not stirred and they think about Goldfinger. John Barry and Shirley Bassey make every musical number unforgettable, from the title song to the closing.

In addition to the villain Goldfinger, we see great use of the Bond 'brute', who is usually the toughest henchman working for the main villain. Oddjob is probably the most recognizable brute of the series with a signature hat throwing maneuver everyone knows and remembers.

I've always come back to this film as the definitive Bond film. I particularly liked the integration of high-tech gadgetry into the fold, with very clever and amusing scenes throughout the film. I'm a fan of Sean Connery as James Bond, though I like all of the actors who've portrayed Bond through the years. Where there's Bond, there's a girl, and this film has a very interesting and believable sidekick. Goldfinger the villain isn't anything overly special, but he's effective in his role as a solid villain. Overall, Goldfinger is probably a great starting point for those getting into the Bond film series.

This iconic feature is widely acknowledged as the best of the series and is certainly the most important, introducing as it does the basic template that the series would follow going forward.  Connery is at the top of his game, and director Guy Hamilton with screenwriters Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn construct a narrative that is so entertaining and exciting that it breezes right by several lapses in logic.  The action-packed prologues, the suggestively named Bond girls, the outrageous villains and their colorful henchmen, the arsenal of inventive technology, and the firm tongue-in-cheek tone were all perfected here and have sustained the series to this day.

I think I'll be able to call up Amazon and talk them out of charging me for the Starz channel; but I shouldn't have to do that. Does Amazon think it has become Comcast or AT&T recently?

This behavior seems to have carried over into the Amazon shopping area. I had put a Norelco Shaving Head into the Cart and then I accidentally added another of the same thing to my cart. I could not find a way to remove one of the two shaving heads. I suspected that I would have to purchase the two items and then I would get the chance to remove 1 of the items from the shipping quantity. This cost me too much time to find out how to do this.

709543,5,630365147X,"I have very much enjoyed that Amazon has put most of the James Bond series online. The series defined a generation of spy thrillers and suspense storytelling that has influenced much modern filmography. Dr. No is certainly a classic, but Goldfinger refined and perfected that James Bond has become, and Sean Connery defined 007. Gert Frobe played an Auric Goldfinger, providing an almost believable villain in a way that was not over the top as some more recent villains. He didn't overact. One of my favorite exchanges:

Bond: Do you expect me to talk?
Goldfinger: No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.

One of the fatal flaws in evil overlords is the tendency to monologue while the hero gets ready to escape. Goldfinger didn't do that, preferring to get rid of his potential competition, whether a shady Mafia character or a British Secret Agent. I still enjoy the professionalism of Bond in this movie. While there's some humanity in him, there is not the angst over people dying. It's part of the business, and we don't need to see what comes after the movie is over when Bond goes off to hibernate for several days after a harrowing adventure.

If one were to view only three movies in the Bond franchise, it would be to watch Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Thunderball, probably in that order. These movies provide great classic entertainment.",1464739200,5,1340,4.767241379310345

Bond is a cartoon character (I guess in a sense he is supposed to be) and I'm not comfortable with stories that have female characters who are disposable entities.  Some of the male characters are disposable, too, but Bond doesn't treat them as toys for his diddling pleasure.

It probably would've been a 5 star in it's time, but movies from that era just don't compare to today's movies, with their lack 'excitement', what with all the action and Special FX we've grown used to.  But it was still a good movie, and certainly a classic.  And it had a plot!  Actually, no FX or CG was kind of refreshing... almost made it MORE realistic.  It wasn't slow or even predictable (except that you know going into it that the good guy wins).  The movie was also interesting from another aspect... it showed how respectful people were of each other back then (gee how the world has changed!).  Sean Connery's performance shows what a great Actor he was even then... simply timeless... that's greatness!  Most older movies lose their edge as time goes on... camera angles, scripts, and carrying out the 'dramatic scenes' making the actors seem more rigid or not as talented as they once seemed to be when compared to modern performances.  Not Mr. Connery.  He's spot on!  This movie was not 'action packed', but still very much enjoyable.  (And I'm not an old movie, nor a '007' fan!)",1464739200,,1125,4.626262626262626

And a plethora of drolly executed lines, such as ""No, Bond, I expect you to die!"". Thoroughly enjoyed this, although I've seen it many times before.

Nothing against the newer Bond films but they just don't feel like Bond Films they borrow too much from newer action films and the overall suave demeanor is lacking and the modern setting makes the plots fell less far fetched and the villains are just not as good as Dr. No, Stavro Blofeld, and of course Goldfinger.
Great nostalgic film love the classic Bond films.  I almost feel like the newer films would be better if they followed the old formula and were set in the 60's and 70's those are the best spy films IMO.",1463443200,3,645,4.322314049586777

Yes, I realize it was a time of ultra naivet and, to a young boy eager to download his operating system, it seemed like a real rush at the time. Too bad they forgot to mention that Fort Knox was empty. Nixon would take us off the gold standard for good four years later. Oh well, gold has no intrinsic value anyway. Maybe some electronic parts or whatever. Saturn wedding rings? And those good ole CIA boys workin along with MI6! Protectin' and spyin' and killin' the last righteous president the USA ever had.

710842,4,630365147X,"The third James Bond film and Sean Connery's third.  I saw it when it was released originally in 1964, when it created a minor sensation among some immature souls that the blonde's name was Pussy Galore.  Connery is his usual perfect self for the part, and it is difficult to decide who has been the best of the 20th century Bonds, Roger Moore or Connery.  Oddjob, played by Olympic weightlifter Harold Sakata, remains a memorable villain to all of us who have seen Goldfinger.  Lasers were very new then and were the object of much interest; it had been only two or three years previously that I had tested a somewhat less powerful laser in my own laboratory.

For the millennials, you should see this one as a matter of film history. It was also the first Bond film in which gadgetry began to play an important role.",1463356800,,818,4.5

After just now watching Goldfinger again, I can honestly say that this really captures the classic Bond feel more so than probably any other bond movie. This has the total package. With probably the best story, villains, and Bond girls out of any other film in the series it's easy to see why so may hail this as the greatest Bond flick ever. I feel that the acting, story, and occasional classic Bond wit and humor really shine through and leave you with a big smile on your face from beginning to end.

It's easy to see why they were able to make so many Bond films since this movie really helped to set the picture for what was yet to come.

Pour yourself a martini and kick back and enjoy the movie that helped start the craze and love for MI6's beloved 00 Agent!

711606,5,630365147X,"The gold standard for all the Bond movies.  Surprisingly enough I have only seen Goldfinger 3 or 4 times.  But I can see why so many people think this is the best Bond film.  The plot and story is very good.  The opening is awesome probably the best out of all the Bond films.  Sean Connery is confident and does an awesome job in the movie.  the film just seems to work even when the film gets a little far fetched.  I loved the part where 007 catches Gold Finger cheating at cards and tells him to loss it all back to the other card player.  The film had a lot of wit, style and humor. For a film that came out in 1965 how shocking it was to see a lady named Pussy Galore.  everything about this movie had a classic cool factor about it.  The only downside to the whole movie is how quickly the film wraps up with the a radar crash of the plane and an escape parachute with Bond and Ms Galore.  I thought that part seemed a little rushed.  The studio probably could have come up with an airplane explosion at the least with Goldfinger in it.  Overall though Goldfinger is highly entertaining movie.  I would rate it at 5 stars.

Looking back on this film. I see how the film did really well deviating from the main storyline of SPECTRE just like in the more recent Skyfall.  That film I believe to also be one of the best in the entire series and seemed to be a separate storyline altogether than the other films connecting the Spectre organization.",1449705600,,1451,4.221818181818182

711858,3,630365147X,"Goldfinger consistently rates as the favorite of Bondophiles of the early 007 films and maybe of all the Bond films. But consider me among the tiny minority of dissenting views. Somehow I never warmed to its apparent charms, and rank it as the weakest of the first four Bond films, which for me are still the best of the entire franchise. I do confess that I rather enjoyed the film more in a recent viewing than in the past, but as before, my enjoyment is pretty much limited to the early scenes in Mexico, Miami Beach and London.

Some of my issues include the highly implausible story (especially the major lapses in plot logic), focus on gimmickry, and the lack of a true Bond girl (the luscious Shirley Eaton notwithstanding, who, alas departs much too soon). The Kentucky and Switzerland locales don't have the right touch of the exotic, and finally theres Guy Hamiltons workmanlike, uninspired direction. My personal favorite Bond film is still Thunderball, with a new appreciation of Dr. No and a nod to From Russia With Love as maybe the best Bond of them all, and overall the best of the early Bonds. Three stars, then, for Goldfinger, mostly for Connery, the title song/credits sequence, John Barry's score, the depiction of early Sixties sensibilities, and the aforementioned first twenty minutes or so.

And despite my lukewarm reaction to 'Goldfinger', I admit it has my favorite two lines in all the Bond movies:
Bond: ""Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?""
Goldfinger: ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.""",1438905600,,1522,4.805343511450381

712001,5,630365147X,"GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.

The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.

Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.

Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.

Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well-honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.

Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE in some respects. But, in GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character.",1428537600,,2129,5.141618497109826

712067,4,630365147X,"Watching Goldfinger after all these years, I'm struck that the film is not at all as good as I remembered it. Bond's pestering of Goldfinger, which costs Jill Masterson her life, seems petty, and the demise of Jill's sister Tilly (the world's worst sniper assassin) is similarly miserable. Bond's attempt to infiltrate Goldfinger's lab in Switzerland is also quite pathetic, and the collapse of the Fort Knox soldiers seems pretty lame indeed. Or how about Goldfinger telling the mob bosses all about his plan, before gassing all of them to death (convenient plot-wise, though, as it gives Bond an opportunity to overhear the plans). Weird, how Goldfinger keeps Bond alive, but kills everybody else...

But Goldfinger himself is interesting, as is his evil plan (extreme wealth, rather than global conquest - maybe it's the same thing...), and the cat and mouse he and Bond play is intriguing in some ways too (Bond has never spent as much time with any other nemesis without having a gun trained on him - although there's plenty of that too). Oddjob makes a great villain too, and the opening part is clever and silly at the same time. Style!!

Like other 007 DVD sets, this one contains even more bonus material than the film. In the ""Declassified"" section you get a bunch of video stuff: ""Sean Connery from the set of Goldfinger"" (3:12) is a bit of BBC footage that seems pretty scripted in terms of Connery's responses, with his usual blase, and then he's called back onto the set (supposedly). The ""Theodore Bikel screen test"" (5:40) is fascinating, as he's the man who could have been Goldfinger. He's okay, running somewhat clinically through the ""I expect you to die"" laser speech, once without glasses, once with glasses, light rims and then dark rims. ""Tito Vandis screen test"" (4:13) is similar, with the swarthy Italian-ish actor giving a droll delivery of the ""divine heaviness"" speech, similar to Bikel; he does a better job, with great facial expressions and a cool prop wig. ""On Tour With The Aston Martin DB5"" (11:43) shows how an Aston Martin executive toured the world with a copy of the Bond car that included radar in the wing mirrors, a tray under the seat for guns, a phone in a glove box. Footage from the tour is included, including Paris Motor Show of October 1964, to the US via the SS France. An ad for 007 slacks! We find out that the original car was stolen in 1997 and has never been recovered. ""Honor Blackman open-ended interview"" (4:00) is somewhat light and blathery, with a narrator standing in for the questioning part - it was a recording of answers only that was sent to TV news stations so that they could seem like they were interviewing the lady herself. The ""Mission Control"" section contains the usual selected themes, organised thematically, as well as an ""Exotic Locations"" short film, narrated by Maude Adams, that goes around the UK, Jamaica, Florida and Tennessee. ""Mission Dossier"" includes ""The Making of Goldfinger"" (26:04) under a $3 million budget. The idea came to Ian Fleming after he met a gold broker while at a spa and learned points of the trade. Director Guy Hamilton is Connery's friend. Honor Blackman was in the Avengers, Fleming visited the set, but died one month before the film's release. ""The Goldfinger Phenomenon"" (29:16) tells us that the studio execs wanted to change the name Pussy Galore to ""Kitty Galore"". Honor Blackman explains how she delighted in correcting people who said ""Kitty Galore"". ""No, it's PUSSY Galore!"" A bit about Harold ""Oddjob"" Zakota, a 284-pound Hawaiian wrestler. He's shown in a Vicks Formula 44 ad on a rampage. Corgi toy of the Astin Martin DB5 sold 5 million units worldwide! Cheezy promos. ""Double-oh-seven. It spells: Bond!"" Goldfinger was the fastest-selling film of all time up to that point. Plenty of merchandising. Bond spoofs also started at this time, as others jumped on the Bond-wagon. The Goldfinger theme went gold (appropriate), book sales jumped! Pierce Brosnan comes in saying how this was the first film he saw in the theatres after leaving Ireland for England. ""Original publicity featurette"" (2:16) notes the ""kissing and clobbering"" themes of the film, and is full of suggestive talk. ""Before the scene is shot, Sean and Honor get together to run through some other action for Goldfinger, this time with the emphasis on togetherness."" Oh, behave!! ""Ministry of Propaganda"" contains a ""Theatrical archive"" with the ""Original theatrical trailer"" (3:08), three TV spots (2:20), which are basically the same as the trailer, with cheezy lines like ""Miss Honey and Miss Galore have James Bond back for more."" Ditto for the Goldfinger-Dr No double feature: ""If you like him back-to-back, you'll love him face-to-face with his deadliest enemies: Goldfinger and Doctor No!"" The ""Radio Communications"" section contains more scripted answers provided for journalists so that they can seem like they're having an interview, like the Honor Blackman bit, but audio only. ""Image Gallery"" contains lots of pictures: Filmmakers (4), Portraits (11), Pre-credits (16), The Fontainbleu (10), Bond and Jill (8), M's Office (4), Dinner with Colonel Smithers (3), Stoke Poges (31), Andermatt (16), The Laser Table (8), Honored with Honor (4), The Flying Circus (7), Auric Stud (23), A Roll in the Hay (11), Fort Knox (9), No time to be rescued (5), The Aston Martin DB5 (4), Gilding Jill (9), Ken Adams (3), Bond meets his maker (5), ""Goldfinger"" around the world (8). The best pictures are of Shirley Eaton being gilded for her death scene (the actress looking very much alive, of course), Oddjob on a horse, Connery and Fleming face-to-face, movie posters, and merchandising items, like Oddjob dolls (wearing a karate gi!), a Goldfinger-Bond plate, a book gun, etc.",1422403200,,5766,4.980290456431535

712152,5,630365147X,"GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.

The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.

Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.

Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.

Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well-honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.

Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE in some respects. But, in GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character.",1421280000,,2129,5.141618497109826

It is has all the standard fixtures of the franchise, beautiful women, exotic locals, high tech spy gadgets, and possibly the most suave and sexy Bond of them all Sean Connery.

I'll be honest, my favorite Bond is Daniel Craig, as he has had the luxury of following and learning from previous Bond actors.  In a sense, Craig has perfected the roll of Bond into a somewhat believable and yet superhuman persona. Yet, I can't help thinking when Ian Fleming first imagined the character of Bond, his image of the character, would have been closer to the Connery performance than Craig's.  (it should be noted that Fleming was at first against the choice of Connery as Bond; however after Dr. No. Connery's performance had won Fleming over so much that, Fleming included  Scottish ancestry in subsequent Bond novels.)

This film has aged surprisingly well and is a must see if you are a James Bond fan. If you could only see one James Bond film it would be tough to choose from this one and Casino Royale. (sorry Skyfall and Goldeneye your #3&4 on my list.) As much as I admire Craig however, I would still choose Goldfinger as the cannot miss James Bond film.",1418860800,,1304,4.722466960352423

The ""action"" is pretty quiet by today's amped-up standards. Some will say that is what makes this film stand the test of time. Like any cult film, this one will have its die-hard adherents. It plays a bit stuffy. The technology is, of course, highly quaint now. Back then, it seemed very futuristic, I'm sure. I couldn't help noting Sean Connery's wig throughout, now that we know he wore one in all the Bond films. The Goldfinger villain seems staid and not very threatening. He's supposedly British, so why does he revert to some sort of Russian accent halfway through?
The silly crime of knocking off Fort Knox using some sort of
""nerve gas"" sprayed by a fleet of Piper Cubs piloted by women will have you smirking a bit, as the soldiers all pretend to faint or pass out.

The plot is complex but has the 'villain', Goldfinger, an ex-Nazi(played ironically by someone who actually served in WW2's German army, Gert Frobe), planning to use a North Korean nuclear device(this is decades before the real one) to irradiate our gold reserve at Fort Knox.  As usual with Bond films, you shouldn't analyze the plot, as most of them make no sense.

713014,5,630365147X,"The Bond franchise finds its long-term footing in this third installment, striking a masterful balance between larger-than-life characters, silly overindulgence and skilled espionage work - a tricky combination that doesn't usually work. Where Dr. No and From Russia With Love were deathly serious, concentrating heavily on suspense, Goldfinger is far less afraid to kick back and have a little fun when the opportunity arises. There's definitely a healthy dose of the 1960s at play here, from the fashions on display to the attitudes of those wearing them, but in almost every single instance that results in a stronger, more vibrant cast. Despite their appallingly silly names, Oddjob, Pussy Galore and even Goldfinger himself are thoroughly deep, interesting, remarkable characters with a lot going on beneath the surface. The exploration of each villain's unique nooks and crannies, paired with an intensely curvy, unpredictable plot and the unmistakable presence of Bond himself, provides more fuel than any film could reasonably require. Quick in wit and in pace, it covers a lot of ground with admirable efficiency, leaves us with two fistfuls of memorable moments, and raises the stakes to staggering heights.

713073,5,630365147X,"With the third entry in the 007 series, the gold standard for a rollicking James Bond escapade has been forged!  This movie works on so many levels, it makes the previous two films look like simple warm-up exercises. I have long questioned the inclusion of The Spy Who Loved Me (this entry's immediate predecessor) on the short list of AAA Bond titles. I don't think anyone in their right mind would question this movie's credit-worthiness.

If you've seen Skyfall, you will appreciate the latter films nod to this classic. That fantastic car gets a big role here, with its oil slicks, machine guns and of course the ejection seat. Daniel Craig only jokingly threatens to use it; Sean Connery does.

To break down why the movie works so well, I would cite the brisk flow of the film, the masterful technique, and Connery's pitch-perfect gambol which invites us along for an unforgettable ride. Unlike the previous two films, this movie has no issues at all with the pacing. The story flows easily from one scene to the next, punctuated by buxom Bond babes and clever quips that appear just when they should. Even the obligatory banter with the ever-hopeful Moneypenny does not seem wedged into the movie with a crowbar.

The cinematography of this movie is about as good as it gets. The way scenes are framed (a tableau of thugs at Goldfinger's Kentucky estate comes to mind). An early sweep of the Miami skyline focuses in on a high diver, who splashes into a pool with a window in the lobby of a hotel. The man watching on the other side of the glass is Felix, who we follow to his meeting with a relaxing Bond. It feels like one smooth pan all the way. The movie itself is as slick as the super spies who populate it.
This is the movie I would show to any non-Bond fan in order to explain the phenomenon. If they don't love it, there is really no helping them.

The only critsicm I would level at the movie is the fight scenes. As always, they seem a little stilted, as though no one wanted to hurt anyone because after all, it's only pretend. I am sure these were excellent fight scenes for a simpler time, however, so I don't penalize it much for that.

And was that a dig at fellow exports The Beatles, who were soaring in popularity at the time the movie came out? Luckily Sir Paul did not hold it against the super spy, and went on to add a musical composition to the Bond legend years later.",1384646400,,2400,4.455580865603645
713074,4,630365147X,"Released in 1964 (or January, 1965, in the USA), ""Goldfinger"" was the third Bond film in three years. This was the film that pushed 007 over-the-top and is rightly considered a classic. It's very iconic of mid-60's cinema -- the title song, the gold-painted woman, Oddjob's deadly hat and the breaking into Fort Knox. Despite this, the next two films in the series are actually better -- ""Thunderball"" (1965) and ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967). ""Thunderball"" made more at the box office than any other Bond flick from the Connery era and ""You Only Live Twice"" upped the ante with the action & spy stuff and is just more all-around entertaining.

Yet ""Goldfinger"" continues to be the Bond film that's most highly regarded of the 60s and this should be respected. But don't expect the wall-to-wall action that was introduced with ""You Only Live Twice"" and remains to this day. Yes, ""Goldfinger"" has some quality action sequences, but far less than what you'd typically get from a Bond flick post-""Thunderball"". In fact, one clash in the film is a simple game of golf between James and Goldfinger. An earlier scene involves Bond forcing Goldfinger to lose a card game. This doesn't make ""Goldfinger"" bad, of course, just different.

Other positives include a fairly long sequence in the magnificent Swiss Alps, where it was shot, and quality Bond babes like Shirley Eaton and brief appearances by Margaret Nolan and Nadja Regin; Honor Blackman is also cool as Pussy Galore, but she never tripped my trigger.

Despite all the good, there are some negatives. For instance, the gas fly-over by Pussy Galore's girls and the falling-over of the troops comes off very lame. There's also too much ""down time"" that's not all that interesting.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Goldfinger"" is a James Bond classic, full of iconic imagery and scenes. When it was released it was truly extraordinary, but it now seems kind of tame and sometimes even lame. Regardless, it's definitely a worthy Bond flick and has it's own unique charm.

The film runs 110 minutes.

In Goldfinger, Bond faces off against his most flamboyant nemesis, Auric Goldfinger, a German gold collector, investor and exporter who has his eye on cornering the world's gold market.  In this film, James Bond (Connery) is up to his technique of infiltrating the enemy through his women (first, Jill and then Pussy Galore) and uncovering his plot to take over Fort Knox and detonate a 'dirty' bomb. What makes this film is the character of Goldfinger (Gert Frobe who mouthed the role), the Aston Martin's gadgetry, the witty script and lines, the 'golden girl', 'Mr. Oddjob,' and Connery's stylish performance. Guy Hamilton, a stylish British director brings his panache to this film and adds to the persona of Bond by making him more brash, physical and boyish, when necessary.  The whole gang is back (Bernard Lee as 'M', Desmond Llewelyn as 'Q'' Lois Maxwell as Ms. Moneypenny and Sean Connery as James Bond.  In this film, Cec Linder takes on the role of CIA's Felix Leiter.  The new characters are well-acted by Gert Frobe, Harold Sakata, Honor Blackman, Shirley Eaton, Martin Benson and Burt Kwouk.  This is the Bond film that set the pattern of big sets, elaborate car chases, more gadgetry, a bigger-than-life villain, pushing the envelop (Pussy galore is an example) and the sexual energy of Bond.

713396,4,630365147X,"I've always wondered how Honor Blackman kept a straight face when she delivered that notorious line.  Released in 1964, GOLDFINGER was the third James Bond film--but it was the first to really put the series over the top, solidifying the notions of James Bond as licensed to kill, irresistable to women, and at home with an endless array of gadgets.  It is also quite a funny film, and it would set a sly tone, almost parody, for the numerous Bond films to come.

Based on the novel by Flemming, GOLDFINGER gets underway with an entertaining set up followed by a knockout title sequence and Shirley Bassey's legendary recording of the title song.  Once this has settled down, Bond is called to Miami to keep an eye on Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe), a precious metals dealer whose questionable behavior may indicate significant smuggling.  The assignment leads Bond (Sean Connery) to Goldfinger's operative Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton), whose small role is iconic: the girl covered with gold.  Somewhat later Bond encounters a tough-as-nails pilot in Goldfinger's employ, the woman memorably named Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman.)  Add in the amazing car with its various devices, a deadly laser, a lethal Charlie Chan-like assassin (Harold Sakata), and a plot to take over Fort Knox and you have a stylish and thoroughly entertaining production.

The cast is spectacular.  Shirley Eaton and Honor Blackman are easily the two most memorable ""Bond Girls"" in the entire series, Sakata is tremendously lethal, and Frobe is oddly likeable as the dangerous Goldfinger.  But it is Connery who pulls all the elements together and makes it work.  Although arthor Ian Flemming discreetly said that Connery wasn't really Bond as he had imagined him, Connery was none the less instantly believeable in the role.  The James Bond films would put his career over the top and he would be a star for more than fifty years as a result.  The special edition of GOLDFINGER has a number of entertaining extras, including two documentaries on the film and two audio commentaries.  The film is not pristine.  There are plenty of small blips and dings, but fortunately it is not enough to be distracting.  Lots of fun; recommended.

Going back and watching Goldfinger was as cool as going back to watch Albert Hitchcocks ""The Birds."" Maybe I never had a chance to re-watch it since my teen-age days and being a journalist and one time film reviewist, the film shows that adventure does not have to be computer inhanced. The acting was good, the evil man looked evil and of course his girls were, well James Bond hotties.

I watch only films that merit my time and get angry when burned. This was fun, entertaining and though I knew how it finished, still had an edge of seat feel to it. If you have not watched Goldfinger in a few decades, go back and remember sitting in your favorite movie theater with that someone special. Even the music is great.

So nothing is lost -- you see all the picture that the director intended.

Scaling a wall he knocks out a guard and he is in a tank farm but he touches the side of a tank and it opens up a room that is really a drug laboratory.  He plants a large amount of plastic explosive around barrels of nitro and leaves the tank farm.  Slipping off his diving suit he is dressed in a white tux.  He goes into a bar and meets up with a beautiful dancer.  As he attempts to romance her he is attacked from behind and winds up killing the attacker by electrocuting him in a bathtub.  He then travels to Miami Beach.

He meets up with CIA agent Fleix Leiter (Cec Linder) who gives him his next mission from M.  He is to keep an eye on a gold dealer, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe), who is staying at the same hotel as Bond.  Goldfinger plays gin rummy every day with another guest at the hotel.  He is cheating as his assistant is in a hotel room looking at the cards of his opponent with binoculars and telling him what his opponent has.  Bond distracts the beautiful assistant, Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) by having his way with her.  He talks to Goldfinger over a radio communication system and tells him to lose or he will tell the police that he has been cheating.  He tells him to lose $15,000 to the man he is playing.

Bond is knocked out later on by Goldfinger's bodyguard named Oddjob (Harold Sakata).  Bond awakens to find out that they have painted Jill Materson in gold paint and she has died of skin suffocation.

Bond reports to M and finds out that his job is to find out how Goldfinger is smuggling his gold.  The bank of England wants to know what is going on because of the movement of gold is untraceable and its location can change its value. Bond finds out Goldfinger is making body parts of his Rolls Royce Phantom 337 out of 18 karat gold.....

Goldfinger has more plans regarding gold than just his car.  This film involves one of the most suspenseful and intriguing plots of all of the 007 movies.  This is a high action movie and the fight between Bond and Oddjob is just a classic battle royal.  This movie also involves one of the best Bond Girls who is Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman).  She is a key member in the operation known as Grand Slam and Bond has to figure out how to get her on his side and foil the plan that will destroy the world's economy and make Goldfinger the wealthiest man in the world.

This movie and plot are simply spectacular.  I have read all of Ian Fleming's books when I was very young and this is one of the best adaptions to movie that was made.  It is a great story and features wonderful acting that makes the movie one of the best 007 films.  It is outstanding and I recommend it to you.",1347667200,,2761,4.241379310344827

Of course, it all climaxes in the movie's sterling caper, which was quite different than the one depicted  in Ian Fleming's novel. Some may quibble, but the movie's raid on Fort Knox is a much more ""inspired"" idea, just as Connery says in the film. It's amazing to think just how much arose from this mere 2 hours of movie making in the way of `60s culture, and how it defined and helped mold that era. Definitely a must-see.

714246,5,630365147X,"GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.

The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.

Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.

Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.

Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.

Sean Connery may have given his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. In GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character. With 2006's CASINO ROYALE, a level of realism was added to the series that had never been seen up to then. And so we reflect back on what Sean Connery had established. Strictly an observation and a retrospective contemplation on my part.

This movie just drags and drags, Pussy Galore is Goldfinger's personal pilot, and Bond after being captured tries to turn her over to the good side. In the end, she does. But the whole plot of invading Fort Knox, is kind of lame. I could understand flooding the gold market to raise the value of his gold, but noooooo, as a sign of her turning. Pussy Galore and her girls switch out the gas, with fake gas. And Bond squares off against Odd Job, one of if not the greatest secondary villain in a Bond movie.

It came with the weapon outfitted Aston-Martin, a gold-happy villian,a hat throwing karate chopping henchman,a gold painted dead Bond girl, and another girl with a name that people whispered and giggled about in '65. A cover article in Life Magazine and a hit song by Shirley Bassey didn't hurt either. And then there's Sean. Sean trapped in the Fort Knox gold vaults with Oddjob and a ticking atomic device. Speaking of which the bomb originally stopped at 003 untill the producer got the great idea of stopping it at 007.

714321,5,630365147X,"This film was made the way Ian Flemming wrote the books, with tongue firmly planted in check. By the time Goldfinger came out, James Bond had become a household name, and the franchise had not yet become tarnished by too many gimmicks! James Bond was the ultimate male fantasy, (irresistible to women) and even though his character would be deemed sexist, he would protect whomever he bedded with his life. So, he was also a woman's fantasy as well.
Actually, the storyline is rather simple, Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, wants to steal the gold in Fort Knox. His Japanese henchman, ""Odd Job"" likes destroying things and people with his steel rimmed hat! Honor Blackman plays ""Pussy Galore"" and is one of the most memorable Bond women ever. Connery's delivery of her first name still is a crack up and reminds the viewer not to take the proceedings all that seriously. This is where the script comes in, there are so many fun characters and mini plot lines going on that the viewer never really realizes just how simple the idea for this film is! Sean Connery is still the one and only Bond for many of us, and he's at his peak in this.
The transfer to DVD is great and Shirley Bassey's musical rendition of ""Goldfinger"" is probably the most iconic of all of the Bond songs!",1330128000,,1278,4.585152838427947

Auric Goldfinger (Bert Frobe) sets-up the national crime syndicate for a con, inviting them to participate in the unbelievable bank robbery of Fort Knox; a bank that is guarded by 40,000 soldiers and contains the entire gold reserve of the United States.

After Goldfinger has collected one million dollars from each syndicate boss for the right to hear the plan, the bosses believe the robbery idea to be stupid and want the money returned. Goldfinger destroys them all, one in a particularly colorful way.

Meanwhile in England, MI6 has been watching Goldfinger, believing that he is responsible for smuggling an unprecedented amount of gold out of country. James Bond is assigned to the task and watches from a distance, until the sister of a lady Goldfinger is responsible for killing tries to even the score. As she begins to get herself into serious trouble, James Bond intervenes but is captured by Goldfinger.

Only then, does 007 learn that Goldfinger's plan is to detonate a nuclear devise in Fort Know. This will effectively take the Fort Knox gold off the market; crippling western economies, and make Goldfinger wealthy by increasing the overall market price ten fold.

This is by far the best James Bond movie. After ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"", the James Bond character has been honed to the expectations of a growing audiences. Budgeting looks bigger, everything is broader, more elaborate. Best of all is that the James Bond character remains a very realistic portrayal of a secret service agent.

But I still knew all about that cool Aston Martin and built a plastic model of it complete with a spring-loaded ejection seat that actually worked.  There was a rumor at the time that George Mahoney, who alternated between Democratic and third party Maryland gubernatorial candidacies, promised to equip the state police with vehicles of this sort if he were elected Governor.  This was in keeping with Mahoney's campaign slogan ""Your home is your castle--protect it.""  He would certainly have won the election if 6-18 year old boys had been able to vote!

The movie has a simple but engaging plot that a twelve year old boy can appreciate--get the Red Chinese (as we called them then) to set off an atomic bomb at Fort Knox so that Goldfinger's own gold stockpile would increase in value--a sort of straightforward lesson in the law of supply and demand in economics!

I was surprised many years later at the comment that my own 12 or 13 year old son made when he watched this movie with me on TV.  ""He (James Bond) is not very interested in his job--or very good at it!""  This insightful observation comes from that fact that Bond is always being found out and captured by the bad guys (despite his fully-loaded Aston Martin and other fancy equipment)--and seems way more interested in bedding the various Bond girls than in the spy business!

LOL This movie was the first Bond film to change locales around the world several times, moving from Miami to England to Europe and then to Kentucky.

The manner of death of some of the villains is a bit altered from the book, but for a film adaptation of a novel Goldfinger stays very true to the original story.

While some of GOLDFINGER is dated it contains genre defining plot, characters, effects, and stunts, that are still enjoyable over 40 years later. Even though we're accustomed to some of these elements this is still a creative take on the genre, especially considering that the hero is captive for most of the movie, and the villain goes from being powerless to formidable in one famous scene.

The VIDEO quality is excellent, a very nice 4K transfer, colorful, crisp, and vibrant. The AUDIO is fine but doesn't really stand out. The EXTRAS are contained in a unique menu system.

714495,5,630365147X,"When the ""Ultimate Edition"" 2DVD sets of the Bond films were finally released in 2006, most fans couldn't believe their luck or their eyes. It didn't seem to matter which of the 20 films you bought - due to the Pristine Lowry Digital Restoration Process (frame-by-frame clean up that apparently took two years to achieve), they were all jaw dropping - simply spectacular to look at. And each was bolstered up with spiffy new 007 menus and period special features that were informative and actually worth seeing.

It should therefore come as no surprise that this 2009 BLU RAY reissue of 1964's ""Goldfinger"" (directed by Guy Hamilton) uses those same cleaned-up elements and extras - and is an awesome thing to behold.

To put this into an actual context - here's some examples of how revelatory the print actually is - in the pre opening-credits sequence when 007 plants his detonation devices, Connery then peels out of what is supposed to be a wetsuit, but you can clearly see it's black/blue silk outfit to offset his immaculate white tuxedo beneath (then he buttonhole's his red carnation in incredible clarity). When he comes out onto the hotel balcony in Miami and lies down beside Gill Masterson on the sun-lounge (Shirley Eaton instructing Gert Frobe via binoculars as to what the other card player is holding), on the close up of 007's face, you can clearly see applied make-up on his cheeks - it's Bond in blusher!

Or how about this... as Bond talks to Auric Goldfinger on the golf-course before they tee off, you can just about make out the dividing lines between the square tuffs of grass they laid out to make the tee-off area look more lush. Then there's the deep black enamel of the AU 1 number plate on the Phantom 337 as its loaded into a transport plane bound for Geneva... Pussy Galore as Bond wakes up on the Lockheed en route to the USA - her golden blonde hair slowly coming into focus in dazzling sexy clarity... and on it goes...scene after scene of unbelievable detail - leaves in Mint Julep drinks - the two moles on the left side of Honor Blackman's face...yikes!

All the elements came together on ""Goldfinger"" that would set up a template for decades to come - the eye-catching opening sequence, the sexy credits and the new Bond song, the gadgets, the fearsome unkillable bad guy, the leggy molls who may or may not have your best interests at heart, the cars and gadgets, Desmond Llewelyn as the exasperated Q and Bernard Lee as the permanently frowning M. Throw in the Aston Martin DB 5 with its fantastically handy ejector seat and Harold Sakata as the Korean assassin Oddjob and his chop-your-head-off bowler hat - and you're on a winner. And then of course the film's ultimate trump card - Sean Connery - sex on legs  - a man with something permanently lodged down his trousers and we're not talking about starched Y-fronts. He'll kill you, smile afterwards and then flick the bits off of his immaculately groomed Saville Row suit...

You also forget about the great one-liners - ""shocking...positively shocking"" as he fries the bad guy in the bath; ""The President has expressed satisfaction...that makes two of us..."" Bond says as he rolls off a babe and turns off the radio; ""...Unfortunately he has a pressing engagement..."" Goldfinger says as he dispatches Mr. Solo (one of the hoods) off to the car-crusher. It's all so bloody good - and it still makes you tingle.

Luckily the extras have survived intact too - there's a commentary from members of the cast and crew, a revealing on-set interview with a suited-and-booted Connery, the ""Declassified: M16 Vault"" feature which is just so enjoyable. Although I love the outer card wrap, which gives it a classy feel and a uniform look when lined up against the other titles in the series (not all are available yet), it's a real shame that there's no commemorative booklet - it would be such a sweet touch.

To sum up - when Sean Connery pulls the parachute silk over him and Honor Blackman at the end of the movie as and announces ""...this is no time to be saved!"" - you can't help but feel that the dapper British agent has a point.

Bond 3 on BLU RAY is surely up there with the very best restorations ever done - a triumph - and that the movie is still such a blast after 35 years of endless re-watches is a testament to its durability.

""Goldfinger"" is in fact like Sophia Loren - it never ages and will always ooze sex - it's ample chest and tiny waistline will be making grown men go weak at the knees in a hundred years from now. And even if that bad guy's laser beam is getting a little too close to all of our privates these days - you can buy this Martini of a film, put on the tux, pull in the girdle - and cheer yourself up no end.

Love it. Love it. Love it.

714496,5,630365147X,"I can remember clearly when ""Goldfinger"" premiered in December 1964.  I was 14 at the time and was utterly amazed that this film was playing on Broadway 24 hours a day to accomodate the crowds.  (This would be repeated the following December with ""Thunderball,"" which shockingly created even more excitement than ""Goldfinger.)  I'd been a Bond fan since seeing ""Dr. No"" at my neighborhood theater in June 1963.  (Thats right, there were 3 James Bond films that premiered in the U.S. between May 1963 and Dec. 1964: ""Dr. No in May '63, ""From Russia With Love"" in April '64 and ""Goldfinger"" in Dec. '64.  Can you imagine: 2 Connery/Bond classics premiered in the same year.  And ""Thunderball"" premiered almost exactly a year after ""Goldfinger.""  Now we have to wait at least 2 years or more for each Bond film.
Anyway ""Goldfinger"" is probably the most popular and famous 007 film.  It is great, but I don't think it has aged as well as some of the others.  I still enjoy some of the other Connerys more: ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Thunderball.""  But ""Goldfinger,"" like the others mentioned, is still one of my 10 favorite Bonds.
I won't go into most of the positives since you've read them before.  The major flaw that has always annoyed me is, (SPOILER ALERT if you still have not seen one of the most famous films ever made,) how within the few hours, that Pussy Galore has to alert the CIA to Goldfinger's plan, they are able to switch the poison gas and get the thousands of soldiers and residents of Fort Knox, Kentucky to play dead. They even have time to create fake car crashes.  This has always seemed a bit implausible. I know that you are thinking that the Bonds have never been known for plausibility.  Still don't forget that this was still only the 3rd Bond and they were still being played straight at this time, ""Moonraker"" was still 15 years away.  The American soldiers also featured at the end of the film also just don't seem very American.
Anyway, I know I'm being picky.  ""Goldfinger"" is still a great Bond film and Connery is still the best Bond (Sorry, Daniel.)  He is absolutely at his best in ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Thunderball"" and this film.
The picture on the blu-ray is terrific, beautifully clear.  Most of the extras are from the deluxe dvds released in the late '90s.  I love those ""Making of"" features, narrated by the great Patrick MacNee, featured on each Bond dvd and blu-ray.
In conclusion, if you are a Bond fan or a film fan in general and you have not seen this film, I'm quite surprised.  If you don't own it yet, this blu-ray is certainly the way to go.",1262131200,5,2622,4.552238805970149

714498,5,630365147X,"Brosnan, star of later Bond film ""Goldeneye"", told an interviewer that this movie was the first Bond flick he saw as a teenager in Dublin. With me it was the Stoneridge Theater in the Rochester NY suburb of Greece. My brother and I, along with two neighbor friends traveled to this early strip mall movie house in my old Chevy (I was the only one old enough to drive). One thing about Bond flicks that was true even back when this film was released during the mid-1960s was that they were FUN. Even the action stuff where bad guys died were at least partly funny. The viewer was free to crack jokes without getting a dirty look from a fellow viewer. One example was Goldfinger's bodyguard Oddjob, who suffered from a speech impediment (when the burly actor Harold Sakata later played one of Steve's detectives on ""Hawaii Five-O"", my first reaction was surprise that he could talk). Oddjob's only speech in this film was ""Ah. Ah-ah"". A later scene showed Bond arriving at Goldfinger's estate and is met out front by Goldfinger with an ""ah"". He then says ""Mr. Bond!"", but before he got to Bond's name, my brother whispered a quick wisecrack aside; ""He must be the one who taught Oddjob to talk."" Later Bond movies hae tried to maintain this fun aspect, with mixed result. This contrasts with most adventure films nowadays, which dazzle, confuse and bury you in mindless videogame-ish action. So if you don't like to blown away by blurred action that would send an epilepsy sufferer into a seizure, or grossed-out by the gory stuff, come on back to good old 007, the franchise that has lasted so long that no one actor could star in them all. I keep coming back, starting with doubling back to the first two the very next week. The old Stoneridge knew their audience, me and the guys attended a double feature of ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" that they ran for guys like us.",1258329600,,1878,4.559171597633136
714499,5,630365147X,"It's a cliche` but accurate to say this is the quintessential Bond movie, then again it's a cliche` to say ""it's a cliche`"" but what do people want from a review? Unbiased opinion? Well it's my favourite James Bond film but  to be objective - it still lays down the ground rules for most of the entries in the series that followed and ALSO lays them out perfectly, like a painting you have to admire for hours on end. Ok let's steer away from the art world comparisons and onto the film itself.

First it has a solid plot driven by the villain Auric Goldfinger; a ruthless, gold obsessed businessman who is willing to kill, steal and do great bodily harm to men and women to governments and probably horses to increase his stock of the world's most precious metal. That's his thing AND he also has nothing to do with SPECTRE, thankfully rested for one film. So all MI6 are trying to do is prove he is gold smuggler so they can nab him for tax fraud or some such. Having no real clue as to how dastardly his real ambitions are.

Second, Goldfinger is played to perfection by German actor Gert Frobe . He couldn't speak a word of English and had to be over dubbed for the entire movie and phonetically mouthed the words. Connery does his third most relaxed outing as Bond, and walks cooley through the plot. Clearly enjoying himself and oozing charisma, virility and charm and even concern when faced with an overwhelming opponent in the form of Goldfinger's massive manservant Oddjob and no that's not a euphemism. Third - the choice of Bond girl's - the stoic but double entendre named Pussy Galore (more like just a single  entendre) - ""I Must be dreaming"", Goldfinger's pilot played by ex Avengers girl Honor Blackman - is that another entendre?

Then there's Masterson sisters Jill and Tilly, the former Bond steals from his nemesis at the beginning of the film and gives us one of the most indelible Bond images a dead naked woman painted entirely gold, the price you pay for crossing Goldfinger. The fan mail actress Shirley Eaton must have got after doing that scene. Both her and her ineffectual revenge-seeking sister played by Tania Mallet don't bring out the best in Goldfinger.

Roll on the gadgets and `Q' first shows his irritable grumpiness towards Bond while showing him his latest field gadgets that will not return unscathed,  most notable being the gadget laden Austin Martin, complete with machine guns, ejector seat and bullet proof shields among other things. Richard Maibaum returned to adapt the 1959 Ian Fleming novel into the screenplay, with a few additions by screenwriter Paul Dehn and kept a lot of key passages, such as the  golf game between the two main adversaries, the laser beam torture (a buzz-saw in the novel) and the final showdown at Fort Knox.

Guy Hamilton takes over the directing on this one and keeps original director Terence Young's style but makes everything seem bigger and bolder and the pace never let's up from the pre-credits sequence in South America, through Miami, England, Switzerland and Kentucky for the Fort Knox set piece at the film's climax. Credit to designer Ken Adam for making up the interior of Fort Knox from his pure imagination.

Three of the most memorable James Bond moments come out of this movie, the gold painted Shirley Eaton, Bond and Oddjob's fist fight locked in the vaults of Fort Knox with a bomb (special mention to Harold Sakata, former Japanese American Pro Wrestler as Goldfinger's mute and menacing Manservant Oddjob complete with razor edged bowler hat perhaps the only foe that nearly beat Bond) and of course there's Goldfinger's immortal line as prone and tied James watches as a laser beam wends toward his nether regions and asks ""Do you expect me to talk?"", ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die"". Tie these moments up in a package with a title song composed by John Barry sung by Shirley Bassey, who nearly passed out while recording the never ending final note and you have pure gold.

Niggles? Ok, a couple - the drawling  American gangsters and Cec Linder who replaces Jack Lord as Felix Leiter and turns the character into ""Unca Felix"", a curse on Jack Lord for wanting too much cash to reprise the role.
The picture transfer was clear enough on the first DVD release and it improves upon each subsequent edition to become lusher, deeper and crisper from colour's to contrasts reaching a zenith in this Ultimate edition. The dark parts look damn good too, black as black. John Barry's rich and occasional heavy handed score also really benefits from the 5.1 DTS sound mix, this is one Bond film that should've never premiered in mono sound on it's first release.

Plus the usual wealth of extra's from the making of Goldfinger to an extra documentary, `The Goldfinger Phenomenon' which features how Bond's popularity on screen was matching that of the Beatles in music charts for `twas this picture that transformed the Bond series into a worldwide box office action blockbuster series and the star into a household name all the way back in 1964.

The third movie featuring James Bond, Agent 007 of her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service continues to marvel audiences the world over. James Bond is a fictional character created by writer Ian Fleming in 1953 while he vacationed in his Jamaican property by the name of Golden-eye.

The James Bond movies capture the action and romance found in the books by the author and surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars. The success of Sean Connery created an image so powerful that still to today, it is thought as that of the best Bond character.

By the time the third movie ""Goldfinger"" was released most people were already addicted to the smart sayings of Bond... ""My name if Bond, James Bond;"" ""Shaken, not stirred"" and so many others. Goldfinger incorporated unforgettable bits: ""Do you want me to talk? [Goldfinger] No, I just want you to die!""

With Goldfinger, the plot is to take over the ultimate Gold bank, Fort Knox and while the movie is not filmed at that location, a replica is created and we almost believe we are visiting it. Without a doubt, this is one of the best Bond movies.

Living in South Florida, it was fun to see the film open up in Miami Beach as Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, a gold tycoon plays cards with a man while a woman watches through binoculars from his hotel room and tells him what to play.

Bond discovers what he is doing and tells Goldfinger, who does not like to lose, that he better allow the man to recover what he has lost or he will get the authorities involved. Jill Masterson, played by Shirley Eaton, has the role of the assistant who gets killed by skin asphyxiation [body is covered with gold paint] because she helps and allows herself to be seduced by Bond.

Soon, Bond is told that he needs to discover how the gold is transported by Goldfinger but Oddjob, an overpowering mute played by Harold Sakata, who works for Goldfinger, lets Bond know that it will not be easy to come up against his boss. Oddjob has a steel rimmed hat that is a lethal weapon and he soon demonstrates his powerful skills to Bond by decapitating a statue on the golf course they are visiting.

Bond discovers that Goldfinger is planning an ""Operation Grand Slam"" with the ultimate goal of taking over the gold stored at Fort Knox. He plans to have nerve gas released by planes flown over the site while his men are using oxygen masks.

As Bond is transported by Goldfinger's personal pilot ""Pussy Galore,"" unforgettably played by Honor Blackman to his Kentucky farm, another famous line is exchanged because, upon hearing her name Bond says... ""I must be dreaming!""

The scenes are smart, the plot is fascinating, the technology used in cars, airplanes, and weapons... leading edge for the times, thus Goldfinger became a favorite of audiences the world over.",1249430400,,2855,4.714859437751004
714544,5,630365147X,If your reading the review to this than you really have no clue as to the 007 movie series. It's a legendary movie and highly recommended. It sure does make me glad that the movie that are made now are soooo much better in quality though. I'm not sure how much its needed to get it in Bluray but I cant complain,1246233600,,311,4.032258064516129
714545,1,630365147X,"Although some people listed above believe Goldfinger is the best Bond film ever filmed, there are features that in today's standards which are questionable and it is important to examine the film through the critical lens of when it was actually released in 1964.

I would say the film does possess some tricks and allusions, making it unique to view, such as Oddjob's slicing and menacing top hat to the gold-painted woman who is murdered via suffocation.

Then there's Shirley Bassey's memorable rendition of ""Goldfinger"" which follows the unforgettable trademark gun-barreled bullet framed shot that stares the audience down as 007 makes his entrance.

However, I do feel it's important to remember that when this film was released female actresses were subjected to demeaning and stereotypical roles where if a character was written with strong independent and  bold qualities, and was remotely intelligent or educated, she was immediately degraded with the repeated enunciation of her name in the Bond film (i.e. Pussy Galore or Holly Goodhead). And let's not forget that memorable scene in Goldfinger where Bond/007 spanks a young woman by the poolside before engaging in a business conversation, confirming that women in the film were for pleasure, not to be taken seriously.

If you are a connosieur of the 007 films, Goldfinger does take you on a journey back to when directors cast women as voyeuristic delights (targeted sex objects)(i.e. Psycho), as unsatisfied ""Girl Friday's"" (i.e. Money Penny), dutiful housewives/mothers, or women who've lost their mind (i.e. Rosemary's Baby). Routinely casting women in such a degrading manner, film after film, was nothing short of a political and social agenda, by male dominated Hollywood, in response to an increasing voice during the second rise of the feminist movement in this country.

In addition, Oddjob and Goldfinger during 1964 are cast as the Post World War II Cold War nemesis', praying on the fears of the audience during that time. This is nothing new, however. Hollywood has always felt it's alright to catagorize and disparage a variety of ethnic groups depending on current political trends and issues and it's important for viewers to be socially aware of this and recognize how the nemesis in Bond films changes over the years according to world politics.

I do not recommend Goldfinger for leisurely viewing, but only for serious critical analysis in a film studies or sociology course where the issues in it can be discussed and examined at great length.",1245110400,6,2529,5.1838235294117645

714613,4,630365147X,"I hadn't seen Goldfinger in quite some time, but I've been a Bond fan, and a Connery Bond fan in particular, since I was a kid, so I was especially anticipating the Blu-ray release of this movie.  Fortunately, I was not disappointed.
First, the video quality; simply spectacular!  This is due in no small part, of course, to the amazing film restoration process employed by Lowry Digital.  For anyone wanting examples of BD discs that exploit the maximum video quality of which blu-ray is capable, this is the disc to own -- whether you like Bond movies or not.  Color saturation is rich, while still maintaining life-like realism (especially with respect to flesh tones); sharpness is excellent, too.  One drawback common to pristine restorations of old movies, however, is they tend to reveal the weakness of the period special effects, but that is a minor issue (in some ways, that ""weakness"" heightens the sentimental appeal of such movies).
Second, the audio quality; very impressive.  Unfortunately, my BD player can't output the disc's lossless DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack, so I had to make do with standard DTS, but even with that ""lossy"" format, the sound quality was extremely lifelike, clear, and engaging -- especially with respect to the score.
I don't often focus on a disc's special features, but they are plentiful and interesting on this disc.  I particularly enjoyed the ""making of"" featurette.  The Connery off-set interview during the Goldfinger shoot is also worth watching.
The only thing preventing me from granting ""Goldfinger"" a full five stars is that this is not altogether my favorite Bond film, though I appreciate its importance in establishing much of the pattern of the later Bond movies.
In sum, this disc's reference quality video alone would make it an excellent addition to anyone's BD library.  Add to that the fine soundtrack, plentiful and amply engaging special features, and a classic and very entertaining movie to boot, and you have a terrific purchase in this Blu-ray release of Goldfinger.",1240963200,12,2037,5.074850299401198
714614,5,630365147X,"I took advantage of Amazon's Bond Blu-ray deals way back around Christmas of last year, where the first 6 movies could be had for about $6 each.  I had never been a big Bond fan, but after watching Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, my interest grew and having watched the initial run of releases, I knew I had to continue, especially with Goldfinger knowing that it's one of the classics.

First, as with the other releases the Blu-ray video quality is stellar.  For such an old movie, the quality is fantastic and comparing screen caps versus the old DVD's is amazing to see, and watching it on my 50"" Plasma is absolutely great.

The movie is something I had been looking forward to for so long, with the classic villains, classic lines (Do you expect me to talk?  No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die), classic scenes, and everything you love and know about the James Bond character.  It's interesting to see a plot that's still somewhat relevant today, and even cooler to know that it's the first use of a laser and it's no less effective now.",1239667200,,1046,4.478947368421053
714615,5,630365147X,"The film:

""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" are classics in their own rights, but ""Goldfinger"" really has it all. A good villain, Bond-babes galore, lush locales, and Sean Connery at his best. And it's all done at a brisk, entertaining pace which never feels bloated in the way ""Thunderball"" did.

The classic moments in this film are too numerous to mention. The babooshka-granny with the machine gun, death by gold paint, the tricked out Aston Martin, lasers to the groin, Odd Job and his odd haberdasheries... This film has been referenced and spoofed so many times by so many lesser movies and shows that you'll likely not be surprised even if it is your first time watching.

It's all pulled off with such panache and style, it doesn't feel cliched at all (plus, it pays to remember that it was all fresh and new when it premiered.) Goldfinger has the perfect mix of humor, violence, style, and cool. The mix went out of whack with most Bond films after it, and the franchise (arguably) probably hasn't returned to a good balance until ""Casino Royale.""

Anyway, it's pretty nearly a perfect Bond movie. Relentlessly entertaining, fun, exciting, and just darn good.

**************

The Blu-Ray:

This transfer really shines at times, with impressive detail on facial close-ups, mountain vistas, and clothing. There are some soft spots, but this is quite forgivable in a 45 year old film. Overall, the detail is very impressive, and tops that of the previous two films on Blu-Ray. I was surprised by how many little things I noticed when I just sat back and let it all soak in - wood grains, dandelions in a field, pebbles on the ground. Black levels are rock solid, color is very naturalistic and stable. Overall it's just a tremendous job by the MGM studio and Lowry Digital to not overdo it and let the natural film elements stand on their own merits. So many times studios feel the need to over-enhance their older films to have them ""compete"" with newer releases, which usually just ends up introducing new video noise, or ends up washing out actual detail in the image (""Dark City"" and its waxen faces springs to mind.) ""Goldfinger,"" by not going overboard, sets the bar very high for a catalog film restoration.

Special features also shine - several HD documentaries, a commentary with the cast and crew (including Connery), and some original period promotional pieces round out a really top-notch package of extras.

*********

For any Bond aficionado with a good HD setup, this is a no-brainer. This is pretty much the best Bond film of its era (although I am quite partial to ""From Russia With Love,"" as well). The disc is a definite upgrade over a DVD. Action film fans and fans of 60's era thrillers will get a kick out of this, too.

I recommend buying ""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia,"" and ""Goldfinger"" on Blu-Ray. These three films will give you pure 60's Bond without any of the silliness of the later stuff. You can stop there, or maybe pick up the two latest flicks, too, as they are tremendous Blu-Ray presentations also.",1238371200,88,3040,4.727788279773157

714622,5,630365147X,"Sean Connery stars as James Bond once again in Goldfinger (1964). Easily one of the most memorable of all the Bond films for several.

SPECTRE takes a back seat for the 3rd Bond adventure. This time, the villainous Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) who is (rather obviously) greedy for gold, has developed a plan to break into Fort Knox, but not steal anything. Goldfinger is accompanied everywhere by his mute bodyguard Oddjob (played by Hawaiian wrestler Harold Sakata) and his deadly hat. James Bond is on the case and leaves for America, meeting several Bond Girls along the way including Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton), her sister Tilly (Tania Mallet), and Goldfinger's personal pilot Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) who all inevitably fall for 007's charm.

Goldfinger had many classic scenes and lines that impacted pop culture and helped inspire Mike Myers' 1997 parody Austin Powers. The most famous scenes include when Bond discovers Jill Masterson painted gold in his hotel room, and when he is almost cut in half by Goldfinger's laser beam (""Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!""). The film was also famous for its gadgets, specifically Bond's Aston Martin DB5. His car was equipped with all sorts of cool stuff including a smoke screen, built in machine-guns, a GPS-style tracking system, and the famous ejector seat.

Goldfinger had it all. It is still regarded as one of the classic must-see James Bond movies. Highly recommended!",1236556800,4,1473,5.004081632653061
714711,4,630365147X,"I really consider From Russia With Love to be much better than Goldfinger, but this is the movie that really got the ball rolling. This movie went over so well in with the public that the studios new immediately that they would be making many more of these films.
The movie itself is above average. Oddjob is a great henchman, Goldfinger is one of the most intelligent and menacing villains ever. I guess I really like Goldfinger because he was one of the few villains who actually almost killed Bond. He may not have had that big of a part in the action, but his maniacal genius certainly makes up for that.
Pussy Galore...while she's not my favorite she's certainly right up there. I felt she was a great addition to this movie because she added a certain independence to the role of a woman.
I would have to say that this movie is definitely one of the better ones but still a bit overrated. The plot was a little bit convoluted and the cliches really started to pop up in this one. Definitely a classic Bond.
Lastly, Connery's performance is God like in this movie. I feel that he reached the pinnacle of what it meant to be Bond here.

714718,5,630365147X,"Many will argue over which is the best bond movie in the franchise . If you like gadgets, cars with impressive arsenals and catchy names with double entendre than more than likely you're favorite Bond movie might be ""Goldfinger"". As for me, I prefer ""From Russia with Love (1963)"" over Goldfinger, just for the quality that From Russia with Love is more plausible and realistic. Now that does not mean I dislike Goldfinger, on the contraire I think its #2 in the bond franchise, leaving # 3 to ""Casino Royale"".

Goldfinger is the first Bind film to introduce gadgets to the series, aside from the storable rifle in ""From Russia with Love"" here in ""Goldfinger we see for the first time the Aston Martin DB5; equipped with all the necessary gadgets for traffic alleviation, enemy destruction, and why not, impress the girls on the way. Goldfinger is also the first 007 movie to have a title sequence with actual lyrics in it; neither two previous films had words in the music, just orchestra. The famous title song is performed by Shirley Bassey, who would perform songs to the James Bond films Goldfinger (1964), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), and Moonraker (1979). She is the only singer to have recorded more than one James Bond theme song.

The movie begins with an unforgettable entrance, a pre-title sequence that..Honestly really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but hey it works fabulously. Anyways, Auric Goldfinger is a gold smuggler, and a fanatic of gold..Hence Goldfinger. Bond is sent by M to investigate how Goldfinger manages to smuggle gold internationally; Bond later discovers that he is preparing a diabolical plan called ""Operation Grand Slam"" consisting of eradicating all gold in Fort Knox by A-Bombing it, leaving all the gold radioactive for 58 years and useless...except Goldfingers which he plans to keep and let it duplicate or triplicate its value.

While the plot is a bit fantasy, newcomer to the franchise Guy Hamilton, he brings a magnificent touch of believable fantasy. Unfortunately subsequent Bond films tried to cash in on Goldfingers success by borrowing ideas and redoing the plot. Of course all attempts were futile, they were incomparable with Goldfinger. A perfect example would be ""A View to a Kill (1985)"" it presented a reminiscent plot, only difference instead of gold it was silicon, and instead of Fort Knox it was Silicon Valley. It didn't work, Goldfinger is a timeless classic that works perfect and is in my opinion the best of the extravaganza entries.

714719,5,630365147X,"This classic James Bond film, which introduced 007 to the movie-watching world, cleverly uses the reticence required by film-making in the 1960s as an instrument of the plot. Of course, James, handsome and irresistible as always, goes to bed with all the beautiful ladies he meets: Jill Masterson and her lovely sister Tillie, and later the inimitable Pussy Galore (whose name Sean Connery pronounces with delicate and lascivious irony).

But we are not privy to the obligatory close-ups and body shots or the accompanying moaning that make contemporary films so cloying. Skip the pillow talk and on to the next moment of the action: The champagne has grown warm and so James must repair to the kitchen where the mute but efficient Korean blackbelt Oddjob and a rousing fight scene await him. Similarly, when James bests the cocksure Pussy in a romp in the hay in the stables of a Kentucky horse farm, the camera fades out. It's not until much later that we find out whether or not his love-making was transformative enough to have turned Pussy into an honest woman. Thus, modesty is transformed to suspense. Brilliant.

It's difficult to believe that this movie is almost 45 years old (counting from the date of this review).

(Sir) Sean Connery was in six EON (or ""official"") movies with him starring as James Bond.  They were: (1) Dr. No (1962) (2) From Russia with Love (1963) (3) Goldfinger (1964) (4) Thunderball (1965) (5) You Only Live Twice (1967) and (6) Diamonds are Forever (1971).

As you can see from the above list, ""Goldfinger"" is the third spy film of the British Bond series.  As well, it is the third to star Connery as the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (code number 007).

This movie is based on the 1959 novel ""Goldfinger"" by Ian Fleming (1908 to 1964).

The story has Bond following gold smuggler Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe whose voice was dubbed) who plans a nuclear detonation inside the Fort Knox gold depository thus making the gold supply radioactive for 58 years.  This would cause economic chaos in the West and increase the value of Goldfinger's non-radioactive gold (that he has stashed away) many times.

(Look at Goldfinger's first name ""Auric"" closely.  The word gold comes from the Latin word ""aurum.""  ""Au"" is the chemical symbol for gold.)

This was the first Bond movie to use a pop singer (Shirley Bassey) to sing the theme song during the titles.  The lyrics of the title song were co-written by Anthony Newley.  Bassey would go on to sing the theme song in two other Bond movies.

Several memorable scenes frequent this movie such as:

(1) the dead woman painted in gold
(2) Goldfinger's Korean mute manservant named Oddjob (Olympic silver medalist weight lifter Harold Sakata) who uses his Bowler hat as a lethal frizbee
(3) Goldfinger attempting to slice Bond in half with a laser
(4) the modified Aston Martin DB5 car that has a host of gadgets such as a handy passenger ejector seat
(5) the movie's double climatic ending

Another thing memorable about this movie is its witty dialogue.  For example, take the scene where Bond is tied spread-eagled to a slab of gold with a laser beam slowly inching up between his legs threatening to cut him in half:

Bond: ""Do you expect me to talk?""
Goldfinger: ""No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die!!""

Connery brings his characteristic savoir fare to the role.  Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (Goldfinger's personal pilot) does a good job as an independent and strong Bond girl.  Gert Frobe gives an excellent performance as Goldfinger.  (I found it odd that in the beginning and end credits that Blackman is given first billing over Frobe who plays the title character.)

M, Q, Miss Moneypenny, and Felix all appear in this movie.

Filming was primarily in Switzerland, Miami, and London, England.

Some trivia: Burt Kwouk has a small part in this movie.  He became famous for playing ""Kato"" in the Pink Panther series starring Peter Sellers.

Total box office for this movie was about one-hundred and twenty-five million dollars.  In today's dollars, that's about eight-hundred and seventy million making this movie the first official Bond blockbuster.

The DVD (the one released in Feb., 2007) is flawless in picture and sound quality.  The picture has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!) than when it was released almost 45 years ago.  As well, there is one extra in the form of an audio commentary.

Finally, here is some information to consider.  This DVD is actually the first disc of the two-disc ""Ultimate Edition.""  Bond enthusiasts might want to purchase this two-disc Ultimate Edition since the second disc has ""the best collection of special features ever assembled for Bond.""  (Unfortunately, the Ultimate Edition is no longer available but it can be purchased second-hand.)

In conclusion, this movie is the first official Bond blockbuster thus making it a must-see!!!

714802,5,630365147X,"Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond in 1964's superb ""Goldfinger"" has the 007 franchise solidifying its primary thematic elements.  Connerly is smoothly witty and deadly as the British Secret Service assassin.  The exotic villain is one Auric Goldfinger, played by veteran German actor Gert Frobe, out to corner the world's gold supply. His evil henchman is Oddjob, a giant, mute Korean martial arts expert whose special touch is a bowler hat with a steel rim.  The Bond girl of the moment is Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), Goldfinger's pilot, who will fall for Bond, as they always do.

Bond's assignment is to infiltrate Goldfinger's organization, learn his plans, and stop them.  Bond and Goldfinger will play an exciting game of cate and mouse, with Bond repeatedly surviving close calls to stay close to Goldfinger.  The climax of the movie is Goldfinger's raid on Fort Knox, inside the vault of which Bond will have his final confrontation with the seemingly indestructable Oddjob.

Shirley Eaton figures in an iconic scene early in the movie as Jill Masterson, one of Goldfinger's assistants who is seduced by Bond.  Goldfinger gets his revenge by having her body covered with gold paint, causing her death by suffocation.  Bond's discovery of her body helps set him on a collision course with Goldfinger.

This movie is highly recommended as one of the best of the original Bond movies based on Ian Fleming's novels.",1205193600,6,1430,5.046808510638298
714803,5,630365147X,"Appropriately enough the first of the series to have a really imaginative use of colour, Goldfinger is in many ways the most visually sensual of the films, the unforgettable image of Shirley Eaton's golden girl reflected in a golden glow to much of Ted Moore's cinematography. It's oozing with striking and surreal imagery, from Oddjob's menacing shadow on the hotel room wall, to the little old lady with machine gun or Bond making his entry by unzipping his wetsuit to reveal an evening one underneath. Ken Adam's production design is his possibly his finest hour, genuine architecture of the imagination that is at once both fantastic and strangely credible, maintaining a sense of scale and verisimilitude by his use of ceilings on the smaller sets.

It's also the one that set the Bond formula in stone, something that would later become more a hindrance than a help to the series before something more radical was attempted with Casino Royale. Aside from establishing the trend for irrelevant but enjoyable pretitle sequences, it is from here on that the gadgets begin to assume a more prominent role. However, unlike most of the Roger Moore efforts, they are no match for Bond's own wits - even the famed Aston Martin DB5 does not save him. After putting it through its paces, he is left to his own initiative.

There is no getting away from the overtly sexist approach here (""Dink, say goodbye to Felix - man talk.""). Even Blackman's villainy seems inextricably linked to her lesbianism (""You can turn off the charm, I'm immune"") but one good one from Bond and she's on the side of the angels.

As with all Bond films, many of the cast are dubbed - in this case, Frobe was dubbed by actor Michael Collins. Regardless, his Auric Goldfinger is easily the best of the Bond super-villains, and comes equipped with the best line in the series as Bond, strapped down in front of the laser beam (in the novel it was a chainsaw), asks if he expects him to talk: ""No Mr Bond, I expect you to die."" And for possibly the only time in the series, you think that maybe Bond really has had it. Incredibly enjoyable and one of the best-paced entries in the series, it's not hard to see why this is many people's favorite Bond film. It may be formulaic, but then the formula still worked wonders.

While all the extras from the previous release have been carried over, there are not as many new features as you might expect. Most interesting are Theodore Bikel and Tito Vandis' screen tests as Goldfinger, but there are also somewhat awkwardly presented archive interviews with Connery and Honor Blackman as well as a featurette about the Aston Martin DB5, though perhaps the most enjoyable remain the radio spots from the original release.",1202860800,3,2732,4.733193277310924

714805,4,630365147X,"Not the complete success of its predecessor,Dr. No,but aided by terrific photography and one of the best movie theme songs of all time, this film can certainly hold its head up in polite society. The plot is simple enough,to the point of being totally absurd. Mr. Goldfinger would like to increase his world gold deposits' values 1000% by rendering Ft. Knox""s supply useless for 58 years (using a small atomic device). Also, the script puts our hero James Bond (Connery) in a series of situations, including one on a table with a laser headed straight for his scrotum, in which he could easily be killed. Indeed, in a movie that features agent 007, we find a careless agent, one whom Matt Damon as Jason Bourne would eliminate today with a mere hiccup. Bourne is almost always the master of his fate,Bond relies too much on luck, fate, and the adage that good will triumph over evil. Have you read a newspaper lately? What was great entertainment in 1964, is still a good view today. But, as in golf, one is watching Arnold Palmer here, not Tiger Woods.",1198627200,,1053,4.636363636363637
714806,5,630365147X,"I just saw this movie last night on tv  and I had seen pieces of it through the years... like the other James Bond stories but it's still over my head although for some reason it's still my favourite movie that may say a lot about me but may say more about you.

I'm ordering the DVD from Amazon here and can't wait at the price it's going for... I may just buy the whole bunch that is to say Bond, James 007 starring Sean Connery.

It's about this guy that gets an idea into his head and won't take no for an answer so he plans to rob the US for all of it's gold and then it gets a little beyond me but I'm sure somebody could get hurt nonetheless.

Great color and acting and stars and all that but even so it's just a movie and I think the staff did their job well to put out a product that satisfies the curious.

714807,5,630365147X,"I know -- the ad line for every Bond film makes that statement. However, in this case, it's a reasonable claim. Goldfinger was the blueprint for the entire series. Although there have been several great Bond films since, the series never again reached the high point it attained with Goldfinger. The films has the best of just about everything of the series: the best heroine (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore); the best villains (Gert Frobe as Goldfinger and Harold Sakata as Oddjob); the best plot; the best theme song; the best gadget (the famous Aston Martin) and, of course, the best Bond, Sean Connery. When he filmed Goldfinger, Connery had firmly defined himself as James Bond, but had not yet grown tired of the role. The gadgetry is eye-popping, even to today's audiences, but does not overwhelm the entire film as many of the later Bond entries do. This is one of the few films in the series that actually improved upon the original Ian Fleming novel. Goldfinger has transcended the series and become one of the classic cult films of the 1960's. In every way possible, Goldfinger is a true classic.",1196121600,,1107,4.770833333333333
714808,5,630365147X,"Dr. No was a wonderful start to the Bond franchise.  From Russia With Love returned with even more.  Now, Goldfinger has brought the series to the peak.  The highest budget of the three has been granted to Goldfinger, thus creating impressive action sequences and shot in teriffic locations.  But don't stop there.  Goldfinger is packed with memorable moments that places this film in the category of ultimate classic Bond.

While SPECTRE was never referred to in this film, I never missed it or thought about it once.  Auric Goldfinger and his henchman ""Oddjob"" went above and beyond as the villains of this film.  Auric is obsessed with gold, and his ultimate plan is to destroy the gold supply of Fort Knox, so that his own supply can multiply ten times in value.  Oddjob's business is to take care of 007, and takes great pleasure in attempting so, armed with a hat sharp as a knife and martial art skills that are no match for the double 0.

Goldfinger is a great feel good movie, highly entertainig - especially for its day.  Every scene is wonderful, whether it is action, brilliant lines and moves by the villains, chemistry between Bond and Pussy Galore, or sneaky and intellgient games such as the Goldfinger/Bond scene on the golf course.  But the showstopper is certainly the grand finale, operation ""Grand Slam"" where Auric and his men take over Fort Knox.  Oddjob and Bond have a final showdown inside that is a terrific matchup that was accompanied without music, and worked out quite well.

The story to Goldfinger is smart and fun, but maybe not as in-depth as the previous From Russia With Love.  But overall, this Bond film has it all and is possibly the most balanced Bond film ever made, giving us a complete film of entertainment that is unforgettable.

714809,4,630365147X,"Goldfinger opened to huge box office business in 1964,hyped like never before by United Artists. The most enduring image to come out of this film and to stay in peoples' imaginations is the image of a girl laying naked face down on a bed painted totally in gold. It is one of the most unique in movie history.
The movie starts with its' opening prologue right off. We see a rather weather worn sea gull floating up to a dock. A head raises out of the water with the gull on top. A disguised Bond quickly disposes of it. He climbs out of the water in his wet suit and proceeds over to the side of an oil refinery storage tank. He opens a panel and sneaks inside,wary of the various guards walking about. In a room full of equipment he plants a bomb and leaves. He removes his wetsuit to reveal a fine tuxedo beneath. He walks into a nearby bar and very soon after the refinery blows up in spectacular fashion.
The movies' theme music plays,sung wonderfully and most fittingly by Shirley Bassey. It is one of,if not THE, most famous Bond theme song in its' series. If these Connery Bond movies had nothing else they had fantastic and endearing theme songs accompanying them,with top singers of the day to do the honours.
The opening credits shows us more and more flesh than ever before and each beauty is painted in gold,in keeping with the theme. The movie begins in Miami,Florida at a top hotel there,poolside. Bond is catching up on some r&r,getting a massage from a local beauty when a CIA man(Austin Willis) pops by to pass on a tip from British Intelligence that an international ""businessman"" by the name of Murray Goldfinger(Gert Frode) is to be kept an eye on. Even though he is ""clean"" by CIA standards there is something going on that just isn't kosher. Soon thereafter we meet said Goldfinger who has been playing cards with the same gent and beating him for a few days now....by cheating. Bond spys the how of it all and goes to Goldfingers' room. There he spies beautiful Shirley Eaton,Goldfingers' assistant,lying face forward on a recliner looking through binocs at Goldfingers' opponents' hand and radioing it to him. Bond puts a quick stop to this and puts the squeeze on Shirley. Before you can say 007 he has bedded the fair maiden and they are enjoying the after glow. Bond gets unceremoniously knocked out and when he comes to there lies his lady face down on the bed,covered from head to toe in gold paint....very dead.
James returns to London to be debriefed and to have a meeting with some top European bankers. It seems Goldfinger,among other things,is a precious metals dealer and has some legal smelting operations. But the banks have learned he has more than a passing interest in gathering and melting down gold,the very foundation of the world's currency. If he obtains and hoards enough it could lead to financial chaos. Bond is sent off to keep close tabs on Goldfinger.
We are now introduced to ""Q""(Desmond Llewllyn) as he would now come to be known(he debuted in ""From Russia with Love"",but was called Boothroyd).We are also introduced to another famous ""toy"",James' famous Aston Martin,fully equipped and then some. He heads off to the south of London(Goldfinger has a refinery in the area) and to a golf course to meet up ""socially"" with Goldfinger. Goldfinger tries to cheat Bond during play but he has the tables turned on him,much to his chagrin. At this time we also meet another new character by the name of Oddjob(Tosh Togo).He is Goldfingers' assistant and has a nasty habit of throwing his hat at people. Except this hat is steal tipped and can decapitate if done properly!
Bond and his adversary part ways but only as far Bond can see him. He follows him all the way to Switzerland where Goldfinger has another smelting facility. At a look out point along the way a pot shot is taken in Bonds' direction from above(from another lookout point) as he looks at Goldfinger at a lookout point below. A chase ensues and he catches up to the shooter one Tilly Sommes(Tanya Mallet) to whom he offers a lift to a nearby garage. Later that night they meet up in the woods outside Goldfingers' facility only to be chased down by his henchmen. Sommes is killed and Bond captured. He is strapped to a table where a laser beam slowly inches along between his legs threatening to eliminate his ""crown jewels"".Only by bluffing that he knows more than just the name of the plan that Goldfinger is planning to hatch does he extricate himself out of a sticky wicket. James attempts an escape but gets nowhere. He is sprited aboard a Goldfinger jet piloted by one Pussy Galore(Honour Blackman).They land in Kentucky on a horse farm near Fort Knox. James learns that Goldfinger plans to daringly steal the gold from the installation. This is where Pussy Galores' talents as a pilot come in,as she runs a flight school. She has other female pilots with who she will overfly the military troops guarding the Fort and spray a knock out gas. This will enable Goldfinger and friends to enter and steal the gold. In case something goes wrong he also plans to bring a nuclear device. It will detonate and make the gold unusable for many years to come.
James breaks free and tries to botch Goldfingers plans at the Fort. In the meantime the gas wears off and the troops now enter the fight to retake the facility. Goldfinger arms the bomb. Bond works his way down to the bowels of the facility,killing Oddjob along the way. But that nuclear device is ticking down and he is not sure how to disarm it. Will he succeed?Will James beat Goldfinger in the final showdown? Will she and James fly off happily into the sunset? The answer to the bomb...is no,he doesn't disarm it! But for the rest of the answers you'll have to watch for yourself!
So ended another thrill ride of a picture in the now three year series. There seemed to be no place but up for the movies. And Sean Connerys' star was most decidedly on the ascension. Behind the scenes though Connery was chaffing a little because of the vast revenues these  movies were taking in and he was getting just a basic contract salary and no more. He would later challenge Broccoli and company on the disparity for better terms and more money as the series progressed. But as time went by this and other issues would become more and more of a problem between the two parties until eventually Connery left it all together....unfortunately for us all.
However as far as the public were concerned in 1964 this movie was the hit it deserved to be. They loved the film and especially the star who was making it all happen. The most important thing Broccoli and Saltzman(the producers) did NOT do was change his character. If they had then these movies would have never been as successful as they were. They were smart sticking to formula and Connery by now had the character down inside and out.
Goldfinger was a definite improvement over ""From Russia with Love"".It added a new toy to Bonds' stable,the Aston Martin spy car,the music was top notch and its' sung nuances by Bassey were a perfect fit to the film. Also that powerful iconic image created in a short but powerful scene early on in the film,the girl with the gold paint.
All in all a good movie and with the new remastering done by MGM it is a wonder to see and hear. Get your copy today.",1189900800,4,7310,4.5929609793420045
714810,2,630365147X,"I thought it would be fun to see a Bond movie.  Mostly, I've only seen parts of movies on the tv when i was a kid.  The movie started out pretty well, with modest intrigue and pacing as it presented the Bond gadgets and women.  However, the second half really drags and is just one non-sequiter after another.  I mean, there's supposed to be a litte suspense and cleverness, right? Of course, the movie is not about plot, but after awhile the bone head script is really annoying.  Also, the movie feels dated, the action is slow and cheesy, and it's shot in a very clunky and dull style. Just like the duck on Sean's head in the opening sequence, this one is for the birds!",1189641600,2,673,4.309523809523809
714865,5,630365147X,"As is oft quoted, this movie is where all the ingredients came together.  Whether this is your favourite Bond movie or not, probably depends mostly on how you appreciated the change in tone that happened with this movie.  Guy Hamilton took over directing duties, and recognised the whole tongue in cheek potential of the franchise, as exemplified by the opening sequence, and ran with that.  This opening sequence has Bond swim up `disguised' with a duck on his head, and run around setting charges in an extravagant Ken Adams designed set, before suavely peeling back the dry suit to reveal an immaculate white suit, flourishing a carnation for his lapel from who-knows-where, and sauntering in to seduce a lady in a bar.  This mini-story within a story exemplifies all that was to come in the movie and movies to follow.  Suave, funny, action packed, and of course just a little bit over the top.

Much is said of the fact that gadgets came to the fore - the Aston Martin is introduced in spectacular form, and the women are both beautiful and played by talented actresses.  Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore was the first leading Bond lady who actually had previous acting experience (and at 36, the oldest actress to play a Bond lady).  John Barry has also crafted a fully realised score for the movie far superior to his earlier work on Bond movies.  However, two things above all make Goldfinger a success.  Firstly, Sean Connery is by now completely at home with the character.  His comfort in the role without yet being tired of it adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie.  Secondly, the true measure of a Bond movie is in how good the villain is - and Gert Frobe makes a fantastic megalomaniac.  You only have to check out the two screen tests for other actors to realise just how different the movie would have been without his exuberant style.  The character, as well as key movie plotlines, rely on his bombastic enthusiasm for boasting, and Frobe makes this a believable trait.

Whether you like the comedic elements or not, the fact is that Guy Hamilton clearly got the balance right to appeal to the widest possible audience.  Goldfinger was not just a hit - it was a phenomenon.  This is amply demonstrated in the extras, which include all of the Special Edition extras plus various period interviews and feauturettes, including an open-ended interview with Honor Blackman, on set chat with Connery, the aforementioned screen tests and a 10 minute BBC feature on the Aston Martin touring to promote the film.  Despite these additions, the best of all is still the entertaining and thorough half hour documentary and movie commentary from the Special Edition.

In reality, as a film Goldfinger does not deserve 5 stars.  But this is not reality - this is entertainment.  And as the most defining iconic movie of a 20th Century hero, this movie has more than enough entertainment value to override the quibbles and make this a 5 star success.",1186099200,,2957,4.758823529411765

714871,5,630365147X,"Perhaps teething just a tad over the top, Goldfinger, unlike its two predecessors brought to the screen a polished, gourmet spy in James Bond.  No other cinematic spy comes close to Sean Connery's James Bond as portrayed in Goldfinger.  This movie has everything, beautiful and sexy women, cool cars, villainous villains, gadgets-gadgets-gadgets, surprises, and Sean Connery.  The plot became the standard in Bond formulas, much to all of our chagrins, but the story is pretty close to the original novel released by Ian Fleming in 1959.  This is easily the best secret-agent spy movie ever made, and for many reasons.  It is cinematically beautiful.  It has much daring-do for Bond to get in and out of.  The music is incredibly on target and set the stage for all Bond movies to follow.  The women are incredible.  The level of acting is top notch, from all performers.  In fact, one of the great things about this film is that Gerte Frobe, who plays Goldfinger, didn't speak of word of English, and his lines are dubbed in, but you would never know it by watching the movie.  Such an incredible flick.  Highly recommended.  That is, if there is a single person out there over the age of 18 who has not yet seen this masterpiece.",1174780800,6,1231,4.723004694835681
714872,5,630365147X,"""Goldfinger"" is among the most admired of the Bond films.  It has all of the elements that make Bond such a wonderful hero without any of them getting too far out of balance.  There is the usual Bond cool, a certain amount of violence and danger, a great villain and his henchmen, some cool gadgets, and some beautiful girls with outrageous names.

Here, none of them get too far out of balance.  Auric Goldfinger is a manic to be sure, but he is still within the realm of believability (for this kind of fiction).  That is, he is a businessman who is calculating and murderous, but not all powerful in his reach or perfect in his calculations.  Neither is Bond.  The gadgets are there, but don't take over the film as they do in some later editions in the series.  And Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is still strong and up to competing with Bond rather than simply being there to fall in love with him and to be rescued by him.  She has more to do with the plot than that.

And here the villains, while not deep, do have some interesting aspects for adults to figure out as well as being simple enough on the surface for kids to enjoy.  And the Bond films are full of continuity errors that are a hoot to try and pick up.  You can go to IMDB and read about them, if you want to read about them.  They aren't important to the enjoyment of the movie (or the entire series).

We enjoy the opening bit before the titles and are off to the races.  The first collision between Bond, Goldfinger, and Oddjob in Miami is classic, as well as the round of golf outside of London.  The scenes in Switzerland have a classic three level shot that really is quite amazing even today.  And the scenes back in America where the big plan is finally revealed along with Bond's interactions with Pussy Galore build to the big climactic fight.

Sean Connery was the great Bond and this performance is one of the best.  Gert Froebe was physically perfect for the role.  I did not know until I watched the movie with the director's commentary that his German accent was so thick that every word of dialogue is dubbed in by actor Michael Collins.

Terrific.",1174694400,,2133,4.39030612244898
714873,5,630365147X,"Along with its predecessor FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER is widely considered to be the greatest Bond film of all time.  By the third installment in the series, the Bond series had an ever-expanding budget and GOLDFINGER helped to define the series by laying out the formula for all Bond films that would follow.  That formula is perhaps best expressed by its director, Guy Hamilton, for what would turn out to be his first of four Bond films:  ""We're going to take you to wonderful places, we're going to show you beautiful girls, we're going to have some suspense and some laughs.  But let's enjoy!""  GOLDFINGER lives up to this vision.  It is much larger than the previous two films.  The villains are grander and the plot is larger than life.  Furthermore, Bond seems to have a much larger sense of humor, stylishly making his way through the film with unerring confidence in his own abilities to succeed.  Thanks to the success of both DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, not to mention a marvelous advertising campaign, GOLDINGER became the first Bond blockbuster, solidifying the success of the series.

After the ""gun barrel"" sequence at the top of the film, we are treated to the second pre-credit ""teaser"" in the series.  This time, the teaser establishes a well-known device throughout the rest of the series.  We find Bond involved in a mission completely unrelated to the rest of the film.  The teaser is designed to introduce our death-defying & charismatic hero in a spectacular way, drawing us into the rest of the film.  We see Bond destroying a Mexican drug lord's heroin operations before becoming sidetracked by a beautiful dancer who has obviously met Bond before.  Unfortunately, before Bond can properly say ""hello,"" he is attacked by a Mexican thug in a rough and brutal scene that ends in a ""shocking"" manner.  At this point, the opening credits roll and they are spectacular.  Improving upon the credits of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, we once again see the body of a beautiful woman.  This time, however, she is covered from head to toe with gold paint.  Additionally, scenes from the film, along with the faces of the characters, are cast upon her body (in contrast with the text cast upon the gypsy dancer in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE).  The title song is bold and brassy and would later become the first true Bond hit song.

The central plot of GOLDFINGER is quite complex and unfolds over time, making a quick synopsis rather difficult.  Indeed, we do not completely know the plot of the film until the final third of the movie.  To avoid too many spoilers (as if one could spoil a film as classic as this one), I will just paint the plot in broad strokes.  Bond's assignment is to tail a wealthy businessman and jeweler named Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frbe).  An owner of considerable amounts of gold, Goldfinger has been making a fortune by transporting his gold illegally out of the country and selling it on different markets.  This has caused quite a nuisance to the Bank of England, for the price of gold affects the price of the US dollar the British pound.  The health of the Western economy is at stake.  If only Bond can discover how Goldfinger transports his gold out of the country, they can put a stop to his trade.

Bond, naturally, has reasons of his own for getting involved.  In a surprising show of affection, Bond seems to be quietly seeking revenge for the death of his first conquest in the film: Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton).  After foiling Goldfinger's attempt to cheat at cards earlier in the film and stealing his girl, Goldfinger exacts his revenge, killing Jill Masterson by covering her body with gold paint, causing her to suffocate.  It is an eerie image and certainly the most memorable one of the entire film.  Bond is quick to accept his assignment out of revenge, though his thoughts for Jill Masterson will be easily lost once the next beautiful woman comes along.  Bond quickly discovers Goldfinger's method for illegally transporting his gold, but finds that there is a much darker plan in the works.  It appears Goldfinger has been working with the government of China on Operation Big Slam.  Bond must now risk his life in order to discover this new plot before it is too late.

Unlike DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, the plot of GOLDFINGER is on a much larger scale and is the first that actively involves another country (China) in the evil plan of the film.  The evil plot involves introducing chaos into the Western economy by tampering with the price of gold.  Such worldwide plots would become all the more common in later Bond flicks, ultimately resulting in plans to start World War III and destroy the world.

Connery's performance seems to get more and more confident as the films progress.  In GOLDFINGER, Connery seems untouchable.  Even during the film's famous ""laser"" scene, in which Bond is threatened with a modern castration, Connery manages to handle the scene with composure and style.  His performance in this film proves why Connery is considered the best Bond.  No one else can handle the action, charisma, and dry one-liners like Connery can.  Connery has an intensity about him that prevents the film from becoming campy and ridiculous.  Gert Frbe's performance as Auric Goldfinger is also superb.  In fact, Goldfinger is often listed as one of the greatest Bond villains--if not the greatest.  It is largely due to Frbe's creepy performance.  Whenever there is a close-up on him, I get the creeps and am thankful not to be in his presence.  Goldfinger is supplemented by his Korean man-servant, Oddjob (Harold Sakata).  Oddjob is one of the most famous henchmen in the entire series, known for his brute strength and flying hat, capable of decapitating any foe.

We have two women who compete for the ""Bond girl"" role in GOLDFINGER.  At the top of the film, Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) seems the likely candidate until her unfortunate gilding, sending Connery off into a vengeful mission.  Later on in the film, the famous Pussy Galore shows up on screen, played by Honor Blackman.  Subtly portrayed as a lesbian pilot with a peculiar name, Pussy Galore is at first ""immune"" to Bond's advances.  But even she falls prey to Bond's charm in a ""romantic"" scene which is a bit shocking for its violent nature.  Bond really has to force himself onto Pussy Galore which is a bit surprising, but I suppose it works with the play-fight atmosphere of the scene.  Indeed, it seems that no one can resist Bond, heterosexual and homosexual alike.  Honor Blackman's performance is well-done and she holds herself up as Bond's equal--smart, sophisticated, athletic, and in control.  If you don't count the Mexican dancer at the top of the film, Bond limits himself to two women in GOLDFINGER.  Is he slowing down?

Finally, we can't review GOLDFINGER without mentioning the gadget that plays as big a role in the film as many of the secondary characters: Bond's famous Aston Martin DB5.  Q (Desmond Llewelyn) once again makes an appearance, this time given an entire laboratory for developing new weapon technology.  Unlike their two previous encounters in the first two films, Q and Bond now have a genuine chemistry together, one largely based on Bond's lack of respect for Q's work and Q's disgust for Bond's disrespect.  It is here that we are introduced to the Aston Martin.  Complete with twin machine guns, tire punctures, smoke, oil slick, bulletproof glass, rear bulletproof shield, tracking device, radar, and ejector seat, the Aston Martin is the first souped up gadget Bond has ever had his hands on.  Of course, every single innovation in the car will be put to full use later in the film.  The Aston Martin DB5 quickly became one of the most popular film cars of all time and it is not hard to see why.

With such a memorable cast of characters and images, GOLDFINGER became one of the most popular Bond films of all time.  In addition to being one of the best of the series, it is a good action film in its own right.  True to Hamilton's promise, the film is ultimately a joy-ride and quite fun to watch.  Make sure you don't wind up with the inferior Special Edition.  The Ultimate Edition DVD contains a generous host of extra features, including a ""Making of"" documentary, interviews with Connery and Honor Blackman, original screen tests for Goldfinger tryouts, a film about the legendary Aston Martin DB5 car and its publicity tour that made the car famous, and a documentary about the film's release and popularity.  With Dolby surround sound and a beautifully restored image, this is the edition to buy for your home collection.",1173916800,,8628,4.780405405405405
714874,5,630365147X,"""Goldfinger"" was the third movie in the Bond series. This movie set the standard for the Bond genre, and is generally regarded as one of the best Bond films, if not the best.

Gadgetry goes high-tech in this movie and will stay with Bond in every film from this point forward (with the exception of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service). In this movie we have a cutting laser; very impressive technology for 1964 when the laser was still a very new device. A lot of poetic license was used for this special effect since even visible light lasers can barely be seen under most circumstances, and high power cutting lasers can not be seen at all.

Sean Connery appears very confident in this film. His style of Bond is well developed by this point and remains the standard by which all other actors playing Bond are measured. Most men at some point in their lives (and perhaps some women too!) want to be the James Bond portrayed by Sean Connery in this movie.

There are very cool gadgets in this movie. The Aston-Martin DB-5 has to be the best. Everyone needs a car with machine guns, a smoke screen and an ejection seat (which only covers a few of the neat features). Apparently, you do not want an Aston-Martin near a Ford Mustang, as Tilly Masterson found out. Oddjob's hat, while low tech, presaged the martial arts movies of the 70's. The cargo plane with the Boeing 747 style front end was very interesting. Goldfinger's model of Fort Knox was very good. Goldfinger also provided the best way to get rid of a body in the 60's. One detail I had missed on previous viewings of this movie was the license plate on Goldfinger's car. How could I have missed that?

The first portion of the movie provides two pieces of information. First, Goldfinger loves gold. Second, Goldfinger has something going, but what? The second portion of the movie begins when it's revealed that Goldfinger plans to attack Fort Knox. Goldfinger would be very brave, or very stupid, to attack Fort Knox. But even that is not the end of the plot. Goldfinger plans on setting off a nuclear bomb in Fort Knox to contaminate the U.S. gold reserves, making Goldfinger's gold even more valuable. I guess you can never be too rich. Fortunately James Bond is in all the right places at all the right times, though he risks death more than once in the process.

The locales become more exotic with each Bond movie. This time we get to go to Switzerland, England, and exotic Kentucky (well, Fort Knox is pretty exotic). Being on location adds a lot of realism to these films.

The biggest advantage to the Ultimate Edition of Goldfinger is the cleaned picture.  The techniques used to clean the picture were explained in a feature in the Ultimate Edition of ""Dr. No.""  If you are looking to upgrade from a VHS tape or the first DVD release, or you are a first time buyer of ""Goldfinger,"" I recommend this edition.

This version of ""Goldfinger"" has a few extras that are different from the Special Edition DVD.  There are screen tests and a featurette, ""On Tour with the Aston Martin DB-5.""  There is also an open ended interview with Honor Blackman.  As with the other Ultimate Editions, the photographs in the images sections play like a slide show.  I believe nearly all the remaining extras were available in previous releases.

This movie is a lot of fun. Grab yourself a bowl of popcorn, sit back and spend a couple of hours in a world and a time that may feel like long ago, but really was not.

714925,5,630365147X,"The five stars above is for the movie and this clear, digitally cleaned up transfer only. MGM has chosen to keep the second disc of extras for the boxed set ONLY. While I would normally appreciate that if the boxed sets had been broken up either chronologically or by star, I'm a bit frustrated as there are many films I don't want in the boxed set (they were randomly assigned to force fans to buy all the sets to get all the Connery films or Bronsnan, etc.). That's great marketing but lousy customer service.

The good news--To the film itself--""Goldfinger"" has never looked this good on DVD. While we do get the commentary track ported over from the previous release, we don't any of the extras there nor the new extras (as mentioned) produced for the new boxed set. I suspect a double dip will be down the line once MGM decides to release this to Blu-Ray. It's sad really because, of all the Bond films, this one and ""From Russia With Love"" deserve the deluxe treatment. While I like ""Dr. No"", ""Goldfinger"" really established the Bond personna in full mode while ""From Russia with Love"" gave us Bond with minimal gadgets and lots of suspense. Personally, I love all the Connery films (well, except ""Never Say Never"" which isn't ""canon"" Bond)but the least they could do would be to focus their efforts on providing additional extras for some of the best in the series.

The commentary track featuring director Guy Hamilton and members of the crew(if my memory serves here I kept skipping around between regular audio and the commentary) is quite good and filled with some wonderful bits of trivia about shooting the movie.

The scene where Bond comments on the cognac in the meeting with M and the gold expert, and M is plainly irritated by Bond's offhand expertise as to fine liquor, is typical of the film, and hilarious.

Creator and Author of James Bond, Ian Fleming died on August 12, 1964, before the films' release.
 James Bond's mission is to spy on Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) who Bond is keeping a watchful eye on at the Fountainebleau Hilton Hotel Resort in Miami Beach, Florida.  Goldfinger plays a very sneaky hand of gin.  Bond goes up to Goldfinger's hotel room and finds a black bikini-clad Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) looking through binoculars and the opponent's cards and speaking through an earpiece to Goldfinger. Well, James Bond wins that hand and invites Jill out to dinner as it were.  Actually we see Bond kissing Jill in bed with a bottle of Dom Perignon '53 by the bed side.  In the kitchen, Odd Job (Harold Sakata) knocks Bond out cold.  Later, when Bond comes to, he finds Jill dead on the bed with her body completely painted in gold.  The hunt is on for Auric Goldfinger.

714996,5,630365147X,"Whether it's my nostalgia talking or a plain fact, I've always looked at this as the best James Bond film ever produced. It had the most memorable characters and scenes I can remember over these four decades of Bond films. Yes, it's dated by now and not as exciting as when it came out, but it's a treasure among the films of the 1960s.

It has a winning combination of good action, drama, romance and comedy. Best of all, it has great characters that all of us who first saw it years ago still remember: ""Auric Goldfinger,"" Oddjob,."" and - of course - ""Pussy Galore,"" one of the all-time great names in the history of film!

The story moves fast without overdoing the action. Sure some of it - especially today - looks contrived and corny, but that's part of the fun and charm of the film. Meanwhile, Bond's Aston-Martin DB5 sports car will never go out of style. It's still very cool.....like the film.",1145577600,,904,4.472727272727273
714997,5,630365147X,"Goldfinger is one of the most recognized and celebrated Bond films, starring the charming, confident, brilliant, and suave Connery as 007, a man every male viewer wants to be and every female viewer wants to be with.  We've got the over-the-top villians in the form of the filthy rich, despicable, and card-cheating Goldfinger and his bulky henchman Oddjob.  We've got the alluring female (not a pawn, but a powerful woman) played by Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore.  And, of course, the gadgetry, ranging from lasers to the tricked out Aston-Martin with an ejection seat (and more) to Goldfinger's plane to Oddjob's lethal black hat.

Anyone who was introduced to Bond via the movies of the 1990's and 2000's should return to this classic (the third Bond movie in a list that will reach 21 with 2006's release of Casino Royale) to see where it all came from.  The later Bond movies skimp on plot and go for awe-inspiring death-defying tricks whenever possible.  Goldfinger has some great tricks, of course, but also excellent dialogue and a well-crafted plot.",1140393600,10,1059,4.954802259887006
714998,5,630365147X,"The initial filmic foray into James Bonds world, the 1962 DR. NO  introduced a number of key elements in what would become known as the ""James Bond formula."" We have the suave and sophisticated British agent defeating a larger than life villain among an exotic land populated by beautiful, exotic women, some good and some bad, and signature sets designed by the legendary designer Ken Adam. Then a year later came FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, the second entry which further added the elements of a shocking pre-credits sequence, a gadget laden briefcase and a seemingly indestructible henchman in the shape of Robert Shaw's Red Grant. Yet, it is 1964s GOLDFINGER which is almost universally acknowledged as setting the blueprint for all future movies not only because it combined all the previous element, but that it put them all together in one bigger and more fantastic tapestry of overblown action and spectacle. It's not surprising that many Bond fans list this extravaganza as one of the most consistently entertaining of the series.
Based on the 1959 book by Ian Fleming, the main attraction in this movie is the villain, who utters some of the most memorable lines in film history. Who can forget the image of Bond strapped down to a table about to be dissected by a laser. ""Do you expect me to talk?,"" asks 007 nervously eyeing the danger. ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die,"" replies Goldfinger before going on about his business.
We catch our first sight of Goldfinger on Miami Beach immediately after a stand-alone precredits sequence and a main title sequence that features Shirley Bassey belting out the famous title track.
In a quite ingenious manner Goldfinger is cheating at cards. It's not long before Bond has figured out the manner by which he is doing it, but also met a very beautiful blonde named Jill Masterson (played by the impossibly beautiful Shirley Eaton) and turned the tables on Goldfinger - all in a matter of a couple of minutes (this 007 guy doesn't stick around I tell you). However, later that night, as Bond recovers from being knocked out cold we are presented with one of the iconic images of 1960s pop culture with a dead Jill, nude on a bed and covered entirely in gold paint. This image proved so enticing that it became a trademark image associated with the film and the series for years to, come.
Another trademark image from the movie is a giant Korean (the actor was actually Hawaiian) who kills people with a steel-rimmed bowler hat. Oddjob, who would set the standard by which all future henchmen would be measured) makes his first on-screen appearance in a game of golf (although he is clearly the one who knocked Bond out earlier). In what is one of my favorite sequences in the 40-plus years of the Bond franchise Goldfinger is at it again - cheating. This time when a ball is lost Oddjob simply drops another ball in a more convenient location. However yet again Bond manages to turn the tables on him. It's the understated game of cat and mouse set on the lush green golf course that really set the magic for me in this scene.
The book is set into three sections and these are mirrored here in this movie. The first section of the book is titled ""Happenstance"" in that one meeting can be a matter of timing and focuses mainly on the meeting between 007 and Goldfinger in Miami. The second section is titles ""Coincidence"" to explain a second meeting and this focuses on the golf game between the two. The third section is titled ""Enemy Action"" in explaining Goldfingers take on 007s third encounter with 007 and details the confrontation between the two in Switzerland that form the middle-part of the movie.
Another seminal image of the movie is the gadget laden Aston Martin DB5 complete with ejector seat. Pushing the envelope and taking its cue from the briefcase in the previous movie here we have a car that includes among its special features an oil slick, homing system, guns behind the lights and revolving number plates.
Truly this is the seminal entry in the franchise and we are treated here to a nice collection of special features the most impressive of which is a scene specific commentary from director Guy Hamilton.
On a sidenote - work is currently underway by Lowry Digital to restore this movie, if audio and video is of primary importance to you then you might want to wait until that is released in 2006.",1137542400,22,4373,4.701434159061278
714999,5,630365147X,"Dashing spies, beautiful women, criminal masterminds, gadget cars, and unforgettable one-liners.  This is one of the first places to find all that.  The James Bond films of the 60s and 70s were quite different from the more action oriented ones of the 90s and 2000s.  Bond flicks of this age were less about action and special effects and more about solid plots, classic lines, memorable (if sometimes unbelievable) characters, and they had much more clever humor.  The story can get pretty silly at times but it has the spark and charm of the characters and plot to make you completely forget the silliness.

A classic opening with Bond blowing up a criminal HQ with plastic explosives, exchanging clever lines with contact, making out with a beautiful girl, and killing a villian in a dramatic fashion is what your treated to in the first five minutes of the film.  Then the opening credits playing the sexy and classy movie theme and then beautiful overhead shots of a Florida beach resort.  We are then introduced to the villian who shares the title with the film.  Au Goldfinger is a classic villian who set the standards for movie villians in the following decades.  Even more so is his henchman Oddjob who kills his victims by throwing a steel brim hat at them.  In any other movie that would seem to absurd to be credible but for some reason in a James Bond movie it works just fine

Classic scenes include the famous laser heading for the groin with its famous dialogue and tense atmosphere.  Women are no longer treated as sex objects (with the possible exception of the poor soul who dies a rather interesting death right at the beginning of the film). The women aren't invicible and treated with kid gloves either.  No less than two die near the beginning of the film but its balanced out considering that over a hundred men get killed.  Spy gadgets and technology make one of the, if not their, first appearance in this movie.  A car with an ejection seat have become standard in most spy parodies and when was the last time you've seen a cheesy action flick without a 'Q'

Some scenes have no action at all but are nonetheless very effective.  Such as the golf scene where Bond uses Goldfinger's own cheating habits against him to make him lose the game.  Goldfinger's reaction to the lost shows us how demented and wicked he is while Bond's actions show how clever and how he can take advantage of any moment.  Sean Connery displays one of his best Bond performences ever as well as one of his best performences period.  Nobody has been able to bring the character to life like he did and nobody has carried on and passed on a legacy as well as he has done.

During the evening, instead of watching some present day horror flick or overrated teen movie,  put this film on and experience spy action like you never have before",1135641600,6,2839,4.602385685884692
715000,5,630365147X,"GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged. This is arguably Sean Connery's finest James Bond film. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant as established in DR. NO but with a more broader and captivating ironic sense of humor.

Many elements that distinguish and embellish a James Bond film are present in GOLDFINGER. The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public. All these elements add to the mystique of the cinematic world of James Bond.

Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series. Bond has a job to do. Connery's outer cool detachment of that job as seen through the eyes of ""Q"" is a pretense to his inner determination to see Goldfinger and company get their comeuppance. Yes, Bond has fun along the way but relishes in the moment of vengeance over the vanquished villains.

Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement.

715001,4,630365147X,"GOLDFINGER burst onto the scene in 1964 and the Bond world would never be the same.  Though the previous two entries had been well-received, this is the one that touched off the worldwide phenomenon that propelled the series well into our own generation (currently filming Bond movie #21!!)  In fact, it would become the Bond movie that all other's would be compared to (""yeah, I liked the latest Bond movie alright, but it wasn't as good as GOLDFINGER!!)

GOLDFINGER introduced us to so much of what would become trademarks of the series.  It was the first to have an independent opening sequence (yes, FRWL had one, but it was more of a prelude than a stand-alone ""mini-movie"").  It was the first Bond film to have a title song sung during the opening credits (which would also become a fan-favorite Bond theme).  It featured the first souped-up gadget car (hailed by many as still the best).  It introduced us to the first ""larger-than-life"" henchman in the character of OddJob - a silent-but-deadly killer who would be the quintessential Bond henchman until Jaws came along.  And, it featured the first main villain to truly stand on his own alongside of Bond.  Gert Frobe left a memorable impression as the titular nemesis, and is also a fan-favorite to this day.  Finale, it features the first of many double-entendre female characters - Pussy Galore(a very overrated Bond gal, by the way)

Unfortunately, the movie also introduced us to that ""other"" element of the Bond series, and that is the ""over-the-top"" action spectacle.  Sure, it is nowhere near as out-there as Bond in a submersible car, or Bond on the moon, but the genesis of all that followed in the ""unbelievable"" department begins here.  And this is where my criticism of the film really comes in.  Having just watched for the umpteenth time this weekend, I was really able to see the flaws of the film.  For the first time, Bond is placed in an elaborate ""machine-of-death,"" when a simple gunshot to the head would do.  Yeah, it's a lasting image no doubt - that of Connery strapped to a table with a laser inching it's way toward his, ahem, mojo.  And yes, it provides us with the first classic Bond line - ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" - however, it is a really silly moment compared to the series up to that point, and begins to take us into the more fantastic and out of the more believable.

Several other actions by Goldfinger leave one wondering how intelligent he really was.  In the above mentioned scene, all Bond has to do is suggest he knows more than Goldfinger thinks he does about his fiendish plot, and Goldfinger gives in and allows him to live.  Why didn't he simply ask Bond to prove it - tell him what else he knows?  He could easily have exploited how little Bond knew.  Later, GF pitches his plan to a room full of mafia bosses (in one of the goofiest scenes with GF opening all kinds of hidden maps and displays in the room and the gangsters responding with lines like, ""What is this, some kinda merry-go-round?"")  When one of the hoods declines being involved, GF has him taken out and secretly shot.  However, he ends up gassing all the other hoods in the VERY NEXT SCENE!  WHY?  Who knows!?  If he was going to kill them all, why take the one guy out and kill him seperately?  If he was going to kill them all, why even tell them his plan?  Yes, unfortunately, the more elaborate the film gets, the sillier it gets as well.

Which leads us to a bizarre finale.  Having foiled GF's scheme, Bond is sent home on a US Jet, presumably millitary.  This is at an airstrip surrounded by millitary - yet somehow, GF and Pussy have gotten aboard, incapcitated the pilots . . . ah, it's just too much!

Well, I have alot of complaints, obviously, and it mainly because I see the film in its context as being the first to really bring Bond down.  DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE tried very hard to give Bond some street cred as a believable Secret Agent - GOLDFINGER and later films tore that image down and turned Bond into what he is today - another generic action hero.  That being said, there is still plenty of charm in this film - and it is still a Bond classic, if only for its score, villain, and Connery's most relaxed and comfortable performance in the role.  His first, ""Bond, James Bond"" in this film is said with such suave dismissal, that you realize for the first time that Connery IS INDEED Bond, James Bond.",1125964800,3,4417,4.5188916876574305
715022,5,630365147X,"You have to love the sound track, the one-liners, the ladies!!! What more can you say!!!  The action in the movie is excellent and keeps you on your toes till the end.

715023,5,630365147X,"This was the second greatest Bond film (my favorite one being FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE).  The Bond theme song is great, and we have yet another Bond girl with a sexually-suggestive name, Pussy Galore (parodied in Austin Powers as such names like ""Alotta Fagina"" for example).  Bond doesn't play cards in this one, but he does shoot up a lot of things and wins the girl in the end.  The gadgets were great, and even believable to some extent.  And of course, a nuclear warhead is involved.  Oh yeah, and there's a naked lady painted gold.

This is one case where the movie was better than the book.  I thought some of the book wasn't really believable but the movie was more realistic, believe it or not.

This was a refreshing turn from other Cold War spy movies, where they're just going after the Russians.  Something like that would be dated today, for obvious political reasons, but Goldfinger is the perfect, timeless villain who could fit into any evil situation.  Odd Job is a funny character and it's great the way he dies, especially when he deserves it.

All in all one of the best of the Bond films.",1122681600,3,1107,4.5125628140703515
715024,5,630365147X,"I was introduced to the Bond films in the 80's and have followed them since so one would think I would prefer Moore or maybe Dalton or Brosnan. But when I think Bond/007, I only think of Sean Connery and the films from the 60's. I guess it's because the decade was perfect for the character with its look, feel, and music of the times. And GOLDFINGER was arguably the definitive representation of all this:

*Shirley Bassey's great rendition of the title song.

*the classic Aston-Martin DB5 with all the gadgets.

*the strong female lead with that name: Pussy Galore!

*one of the coolest and most beloved henchmen in the series: Odd Job.

*one of the most ambitious, greedy, resourceful villains ever(well played by Gert Frobe-hard to believe he was dubbed in the movie as the audio commentary pointed out).

*classic scenes like Shirley Eaton covered in gold, the ""laser beam"" scene, the rumpus room scene(check out that art decor), and the end fight.

*and great character interaction(love the scene where 007 is figuring out the plot and Goldfinger seems genuinely pleased that someone recognizes his 'genius')

All great stuff. The other guys had some good movies in their reign as Bond, but I think Connery was on a roll with From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, and Thunderball. There was so much style and a special aura that defined what Bond/spy/adventure films should be during that 3-film stint.  And for the record, the other film that ties this is THUNDERBALL imo(which has Largo with the eye patch as a villain, the Spectre organization, Claudine Auger in shades on the beach, the jet pack, the underwater fight, etc). Sorry, back to Goldfinger.  Great dvd with lots of extras(2 commentaries, 2 documentaries, etc).  Fan or not, the film alone is worth the absurdly low price and the loads of extras are what every dvd collector would want. Highly recommended for anyone.",1121472000,,1885,4.877742946708464

My hat is off to the screenwriters: in the original novel, Auric Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox using a system of trains and ships, an impossible and unbelievable task.  That the screenwriters decided to add the A-bomb element to Goldfinger's plan (irradiating the US gold supply to make his own more valuable) is, as Bond says, ""inspired.""

Especially the silent, ruthlessly efficient, seemingly invincible and oddly charismatic Oddjob.

The plot unfolds slowly but steadily, with witty repartee, and 60's style action.

And of course the gorgeous girls bond romances. There is the lovely Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) , who is cruelly murdered by Goldfinger by being coated in gold paint.  The only parts of the Bond movies that I never enjoy is when one of the beautiful girls die.  They actually make me rather sad actually.

The extremely Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) plays another one of Goldfinger's team and a dangerous adversary for Bond, but great to see her come out well and wooed by Bond onto the side of good (even though she claims at the beginning to be immune to charm).

Each of the Bond girls has their own special charm, and Pussy not only knows how to be a smooth operator, she has a body that makes any clothes looks stunning, with a backside that stops conversation.

The plot to Goldfinger is simple enough. Auric Goldfinger has one of the largest collections of gold in the world. He has a plan to contaminate the gold the in Ft. Knox making his own gold more valuable and thus hurting the USA because at the time we still backed all our cash with gold. MI6 James Bond is on the case and with help from a bunch of notable characters it's up to him to stop Goldfingers evil plan. This might not be the best description of the plot ever but it's short sweet and accurate.
Sean Connery gives his best performnce as 007 in this movie. He carries a swagger in Goldfinger that you just absolutely love. No other guy to play Bond really has achieved that. He really turned himself into a house hold name with this performance and he's just awesome. His performance alone is worth the movie.
Auric Goldfinger is an awesome bad guy. Most Bond movies are as good as the bad guys in them and Goldfinger is one of the best ever. Gert Frobe puts a face to the Bond bad guys. Up to this point in the Bond franchise the bad guys hadn't been all that great. Robert Shaw was alright in From Russia with Love but he was stiff and the character was dull. The same thing can be said about Joseph Wiseman who played Dr. No. Gert just took this role and ran with it. He's easily the best bad guy ever in a Bond film. Like Connery you can buy this movie for Gert Frobe's performance as Goldfinger. It's well worth the price.
This was the first Bond movie to put a Bond car on the map. The Aston Martin Db5 is excellent in this movie. The car fight is great and is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.
Goldfinger is the best Bond movie ever. It has the best Bond performance and the best bad guy in any of the films. It's the reason the Bond franchise is where it's at today and is a must for all Bond fans.",1081900800,,2041,4.105

715098,5,630365147X,"According to Variety, the showbiz bible that tracks a film's box-office performance, the first James Bond film, ""Dr. No,"" did well in the U.S. upon its belated 1963 release, but it was merely the 44th biggest grossing film of the year. ""From Russia With Love"" did better when issued in spring 1964, but it wasn't until the Christmas release of ""Goldfinger"" that James Bond became a phemomenon equal to another U.K. import, The Beatles.
The film shows its age with 007's reference to the Fab Four (telling ""Golden Girl"" Shirley Eaton that one should only listen to the moptops while wearing earmuffs), but otherwise remains a sturdy Bond thriller, one that saw the Bond formula more finely tuned than in the previous films (the formula would be perfected in the next film, ""Thunderball""). The pre-credit sequence, like the ones for most of the films after 1977, has no connection to the story, but offers a sort of short hand to what the rest of the film holds: tongue-in-cheek humor that softens the somewhat sadistic violence, and a hero as elegant as he is deadly.
The villains are arguably Bond's best: Auric Goldfinger whose love of gold leads to his outlandish plan to knock-off Fort Knox, and his right-hand man, Oddjob, as silent as he is deadly, an assassin with a surprise more lethal than a rabbit in his hat. They are well played by Gert Frobe, the German actor previously best known for the ""Dr. Mabuse"" series, and Harold Sakata. When it comes to Bond babes, Honor Blackman of the original version of TV's ""The Avengers,"" is one of the best. A woman rather than a girl, her Pussy Galore is as smart as she is sexy, and she's one of the few Bondbabes who you believe could teach 007 a thing or two about self-defense.
A couple of moments do not ring true, and may inspire unintentional laughs. When Goldfinger brings together the leading figures in organized crime, some of them behave too much like frightened schoolgirls to be believed (""I don't like this,"" one squeels, when their host turns out the lights), and the soldiers standing guard at Fort Knox fall to the ground a little too quickly when Pussy Galore's gang drops poison from their planes.
But such silliness does not detract from an otherwise superb thriller, well-acted (along with ""Thunderball,"" this is Sean Connery's best performance as Bond) and brilliantly scored by John Barry whose title song, co-written by Leslie Bricusse and belted out by Shirley Bassey, rocked the top 40 and made the Bond films as notable for their music as for the gadgets and thrills.",1074297600,,2543,4.7687074829931975

Rarely does a film so entertaining and funny as GOLDFINGER come around - of course, this is natural for the Bond movies, but GOLDFINGER surpasses any record previously or later set by the 007 adventures.  It has everything, firmly establishing the Bond formula: explosive beginning (""Shocking""); an attractive female lead (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore); a stunning main title sequence; plenty of humor thrown in with the action; and, of course, Q-Branch's first comedic performance.  Connery is at his greatest as the British super spy; the film also features great performances from it's entire cast.  The score, by John Barry, is one of the finest of the original few films.

Sean Connery is razor sharp in the lead, the supporting characters are varied and occasionally bizarre, and the plot - Goldfinger's attempt to break into Fort Knox - is of suitably armageddonic proportion.  Several of the images in the film are classic - the woman killed by painting her gold, the laser creeping up the table to immasculate Bond, and Oddjob tossing his bowler to decapitate a statue.
However, the film is not perfect.  By having Bond as prisoner in Goldfinger's compound for the entire second half, the momentum and excitement is somewhat dampened - Connery's wit and charm cannot be used by the filmmakers.  Likewise, by today's standards, much of the plot is laughable.  Having said that, the special effects hold up very well, and the giant Fort Knox set is still impressive.
Unfortunately, this DVD version seems somewhat lacking.  The two commentaries, hosted by an expert on Ian Flemming, are dry and somewhat dull.

No other actor has his charm, his innocent facial expression when the bad guy's heroin complex blows up, his wit and timing as he delivers his lines, tongue in cheek. Just the correct balance of charm, wit, humour and deadly ruthlessness. Other actors are too jokey ala Roger Moore, or too serious and bloodthirsty like Pierce Brosnan but Sean Connery is THE best, bar none. In this movie is the classic, immortal line, full of devil may care sadism and sardonic wit and just a wisp of a smile, ""Shocking, positively shocking..."" This is just after the bad guy tries to shoot 007 with his own Walther PPK 7.65mm pistol. Bond, of course is extremely resourceful and throws a electrical appliance into the bath tub which is the coup de grace for the baddie. The stiff upper lip, cold blooded killer personified. Death by electrocution. Very painful indeed. Incidentally, the Walther PPK was the favourite weapon of the Geheime Staats Polizei otherwise known as the Gestapo. Strangely ironic, don't you think? Honor Blackman is in this move, after a few Ju Jitsu throws, she succumbs of course to 007's magnetic attraction. Lots of beautiful blondes add interest including the one who dies of gold paint. There is entertainiing Odd Job, in real life a Karate expert with his lethal steel bowler hat. Shirley Bassey sings the theme song as only she can, with savoir faire and sheer power in her magic voice. The lyrics are beautiful, so poetic, yet sardonic and ironic too. In the beginning of the movie, Bond unzips out of his water resistant wet suit to reveal an immaculate Saville Row tailored white tuxedo complete with a pink carnation. In reality, Special Operations Executive operatives and officers who Churchill sent into Nazi occupied Europe to ""set Europe ablaze"" were equipped with such black boiler suits or jump suits. They would parachute in on a moonless night and then bury their chutes and jump suit. Underneath, they would have all the authentic clothes of a French vineyard worker or whatever their cover was. A case of art imitating life or vice versa? M is splendid too as the chief of MI6 or SIS. He is obviously a veteran of many secret and clandestine operations but has earned his spot as Director of the service. No more night parachute jumps for him or stirring combat rations in some remote jungle with a wooden spoon (no noise to give away your position, old chap), M gives the orders and Bond carries them out, ruthlessly and efficiently. you see the loneliness of command on M's world weary face. At the end, all's well that ends well. I for one like to see the villain get his comeuppance. Gentlemen like Bond and M exist and they are just as charming in real life as in the movies.

715249,5,630365147X,"This is the quintessential James Bond film.  If our civilization wanted to prepare a time capsule to save for the 31st century, this would be the James Bond film we would want to enclose.  Although I personally think that FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a slightly better film, absolutely no James Bond pulls all the essential Bond elements together more perfectly.  In fact, if there is a James Bond formula (and there is), it was completed to perfection in GOLDFINGER.  Probably the best opening song of any Bond film, probably the best Bond villain and villain name, one of the best love interests and names, the definitive car (in the books Bond is attached to a Bentley, but in the films we primarily associate him with his Aston Martin), and best evil henchman (Odd Job).  And possibly the best throwaway line in all the Bond films.  As a laser cuts through the metal slab upon which Goldfinger has strapped Bond, he yells, ""Do you expect for me to talk?""  ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect for you to die.""
This movie has permeated popular culture to a degree matched by few films.  Nearly all the elements we associate with suave, debonair spies come from this film, though some influences are more esoteric.  Extreme Monty Python fans know that that merry band borrowed both their name and the typeface used in on their show from the side of Pussy Galore's airplanes, which read, ""Pussy Galore's Flying Circus.""
Of all the Bond films, this one has my favorite villain in Gert Frobe.  Unbelievably, in filming it turned out that Frobe's English was too marginal for him to supply his own dialog, so in the studio they had another actor dub in all Goldfinger's lines.  The dubbing is seamless, and it is nearly impossible to detect that Frobe's own voice wasn't utilized.
This was also the first Bond film to feature what is now the standard and essential international jet setting.  DR. NO was filmed pretty much entirely in Jamaica, and although FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE had some exotic locales, most of it was shot in Istanbul or on the Orient Express.  In GOLDFINGER, however, Bond earns major frequent flier miles.  He starts off in Miami, and then goes back to a couple of sites in England.  After a channel crossing to Switzerland, he is transported to the US and Louisville, Kentucky and from there to Fort Knox.  This kind of diversity is now an absolute requirement of any Bond outing.  One isn't at all surprised if a Bond film starts off in Mongolia, proceeds to the Balkan Islands, briefly to England, from there to Alaska, with the grand finale in an island in the Atlantic, meeting beautiful women and foiling dastardly villains at every step along the way.",1052352000,10,2659,4.683870967741935
715250,5,630365147X,"When compared to a ""serious"" spy film, e.g. the BBC's excellent adaptations of John le Carre's TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE (both starring the late Sir Alec Guiness), GOLDFINGER is positively silly. But it works, mostly because of the presence of Sean Connery.
Here, Comdr. Bond foils an attempt by Auric Goldfinger to destroy the value of the bullion held in Fort Knox. Gadgets and girls abound. The best of the former is a laser that causes even the redoubtable Commander to wince at the prospect of losing the family jewels. And then there's Ms. P. Galore (Honor Blackman). How is it that modern-day Bond Babes don't have such, um, promising monikers? And the rock-like Oddjob (Harold Sakata) with his lethal hat is one of the most engaging thugs ever to toss 007 into a heap.
Sean Connery will go down in movie history as the essence of Bond. Next to him, all others pale - even runner-up Pierce Brosnan. Imagine Connery, a Scot, in a tux jacket and kilt. Then picture PB in the same costume. See what I mean? Connery has the voice, physical stature, and rakish glint in his eyes to pull it off. Sean should be acclaimed King in Westminster Abbey.
I'm giving GOLDFINGER 5 stars not because it's a great film, but because it's perhaps the best of several with Connery as Bond, and the one that could well immortalize Sean to human history in that role.",1051747200,3,1375,4.639344262295082
715251,4,630365147X,"This is the film that did it for the Bond series. The previous year's Cold War-oriented ""From Russia with Love"" polished the Bond formula to a high gloss, while still keeping 007 a believable detective. ""Goldfinger"" added a big injection of humor and fantasy to the 007 concept. Even today, it's the most exciting ""action film"" in the Bond series, and only ""From Russia With Love"" outdoes it in terms of overall quality.
While there is greater emphasis on technology -- especially that loaded Aston Martin DB5 -- Connery still holds his own very well as the British spy. Gert Frobe as Auric Goldfinger and Harold Sakata as his henchman Oddjob make two of the most compelling bad guys in movie history. And Honor Blackman of ""The Avengers"" turns in the unquestionably best performance of any Bond Girl as Pussy Galore -- feisty, independent, fearless and every bit 007's match.
Scenes like Bond's discovery of a woman gilded to death in his hotel room, his near-slicing in half at the hands of a laser beam, and the ""Operation Grand Slam"" raid on Fort Knox pack some of the biggest punches in the series, aided by John Barry's brilliant orchestral music.
The only downside is that ""Goldfinger"" is where the 007 franchise starts veering from elements of realism into a live-action adult cartoon. There's less of the grit of the first two films and more of an emphasis on the technology and Bond's vaunted suavity -- elements that would leave the Bond series ripe for parody, especially because of its overuse by the Bond producers themselves.
Still, ""Goldfinger"" clicks on a great many levels. It's a riveting, breezy, entertaining movie that set the style for many of the Bond films to follow.",1048204800,4,1692,4.81786941580756

Honor Blackman is the ultimate Bond girl, Gert Frobe, the ultimate Bond villian and Bond's Astin Martin, the ultimate vehicle.  Too bad MGM's DVD isn't the ultimate edition.
The film's transfer is tired, well worn and loaded with digital imperfections.  Color fidelity is inconsistant and faded. Flesh tones are too orangy.  Often whole scenes contain images that appear out of focus, blurry or with a cloudy haze about the edges. Film grain, excessive digital noise and smeared colors also plague this transfer.  The sound is a disappointing Mono, not even offering the movie's killer title track, sung by Shirley Bassey, in 5.1, as the laserdisc special edition did nearly four years before.  Go figure.  The name may be Bond but the transfer is junk, pure junk.

715255,5,630365147X,"While GOLDFINGER is the third James Bond movie produced, it is, in a way, the first ""Bond movie"".  While DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE play out closer to Ian Fleming's vision, they are two plot-driven movies with a relatively realistic protagonist.  GOLDFINGER, under Guy Hamilton's direction, begins the refusal to let faithfulness to the novel, or even plot and character, interfere with the action and special effects, although it never reaches the level of absurdity that some of the later films would.  From Shirely Bassey's title track, through the pre-credits teaser, the introduction of the larger-than-life villain with an extravagantly ambitious scheme, and the beautifully gadget-filled Aston Martin DB5, modern viewers will recognize all of the key elements of a true Bond film.  More importantly, it is James Bond who makes a Bond film, and it is the fact that we know James Bond will win against overwhelming odds because he is so unstoppably cool that makes James Bond who he is.  The James Bond of GOLDFINGER is that slick; he charms his way to victory, too cool to lose.  Sean Connery is at the top of his game in GOLDFINGER, completely owning the role.
GOLDFINGER is a fan favourite; many, in fact, claim it is the best of the film series.  It has a couple of elements to recommend it to that honour.  It does introduce two of Bond's most memorable characters.  Honor Blackman plays Pussy Galore as an antagonistic Bond girl often to be imitated.  Harold Sakata's Oddjob is still recognizable as one of the most silently intimidating and scene-stealing henchmen ever filmed.  Michael Collins, dubbing over Gert Frobe's acting as the title villain, tosses off now-cliched dialogue with flawless timing, making a line everyone has heard a hundred times still seem fresh and menacing.  The movie, however also has its flaws.  The dubbing is as problematic as in the earlier two installments.  There are a couple of plot details thinly-sketched enough to drive a gold Rolls Royce through.  The post-production editing is lacking, with ragged cuts and, in at least one case, inserts footage contradicting the dialogue.  Modern viewers may find a number of elements in the movie tired, even while recognizing that they were, in some cases, first used in this film.
The DVD's introductory menu is the most visually-appealing so far, but, unfortunately, the ""Making of..."" documentary has taken the admirable reserve of the earlier two documentaries into the realm of ""simply dull"".  Along with a number of other goodies, it features a radio interview with Sean Connery.

The exciting Aston Martin DB5, an arresting title song by Shirley Bassey, visually stunning sets by Ken Adam and much more. It has one of the best plots and real gripping excitment.
Goldfinger starts off with Bond blowing up a South American drug area and fighting a very violent fight against Capungo in his hotel room. It's really quite shocking. After that, Bond is in Miami where he learns from Felix Leiter that he has to investigate Auric Goldfinger, an extremely wealthy man who loves gold more than anything else. Bond discovers that Goldfinger cheats at cards and steals his girlfriend Jill Masterson, who in return is killed by being painted entirely in gold while Bond is knocked unconscious. Bond arranges to play golf against Goldfinger, when he meets Goldfinger's personal bodyguard called Oddjob. Oddjob is a mute Korean manservant, whose bowler hat can easily cut apart whatever the brim hits. Bond discovers the Goldfinger cheats at golf as well and turns the tables on him to win. Bond follows Goldfinger by car and meets up with Tilly Masterson, the sister of Jill, where Tilly is killed by Oddjob and Bond is taken captive. Bond awakes to find himself straped to a table with a lazer slowly aiming to hit his body. Bond interrogated by Goldfinger, convinces that he is worth more alive than dead is knocked out. Bond awakes again, this time on a plane, where he meets the personal pilot of Goldfinger, Miss Pussy Galore. Bond is taken to Kentucky, where he learns that Goldfinger is planning to detonate a bomb in Fort Knox in order to increase the profits of his own gold. Bond battles Oddjob in Fort Knox where he gives him the shock of his life. Bond stops the bomb with the CIA just in time. Bond meets up with Goldfinger on lats time aboard a plane where a gun fight breaks loose, a window is shot open, and Goldfinger is sucked out and killed. Bond and Pussy Galore safely parachute out and take a well needed vacation on an island somewhere.

715309,5,630365147X,"This is the movie that pretty much made Bond as a film institution. The car, the music, the cinematography, (for the day,) the casting...absolutley EVERYTHING was perfect for this third film installment of the Bond series, and it paid off. For a time, ""Goldfinger"" was THE highest grossing film in the world before ""The Sound Of Music"" came out. And at only $1.50 a head back in those days, $43,000,000 was no mean feat!

What made ""Goldfinger"" so fascinating was that, as far-fetched as the idea was, the possible attempt by a foreign power to take over Fort Knox was STILL all-too-conceivable! Not much was changed from the book, but it WAS substantial: The inimitable Miss Galore only had 2% of the book, she had 66% of the movie. Tilly Masterson, who had 66% of the book, had only 1% of the movie. Felix Leiter was only in the last 2% of the book, but was all through the movie, and, in the movie, introduced Bond to Auric Goldfinger. In the book, the guy Goldfinger played gin with met Bond at an airport in the Caribbean as they were both leaving the island got Bond interested in Herr Goldfinger's suspected card cheating initially.

In the book, Pussy Galore was actually one of the people brought in by Bond and Tilly FOR Goldfinger to help engineer Operation Grand Slam.  In the movie, she worked for Goldfinger as a pilot and flight trainer...in the book, she headed a troupe of aerialists. (In the book, Bond and Tilly were granted their lives after being captured on the condition that they actually work for his organization AS recruiters and planners!) However, with all these differences, (and there are more!) the ""feel"" of the book is pretty much kept intact.

Another thing, if you are too young to remember: This film, probably more than any other in movie history, influenced pop culture unlike anything you've ever seen! Pop literature, movies, television, manufacturing and magazine publishing all went bananas for the whole Bond aesthetic and lifestyle. TV was awash in Bond imitators on all three networks: shows like ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."", ""The Wild, Wild West"", ""T.H.E Cat"", ""The Secret Life of Henry Pfyffe"", ""The Avengers"", ""The Saint"", ""Danger Man"" (""Secret  Agent"",)""Honey West"", ""Get Smart"", ""Mission: Impossible"", ""Mannix"", ""Amos Burke, Secret Agent"" and ""Blue Light"" started being programmed in as if a sluice gate opened after 1964, the year of Goldfinger's release.

Fan magazines popped up for ""U.N.C.L.E."", Bond, The Avengers and ""Secret Agent"" and commerce, too, dove in, with ""007"" toiletries for men, ""Silva Thins"" cigarettes, ""James Bread from Bond"", ""The Man From G.L.A.D."" and Mattel's ""OM"" line of toys. Nothing...repeat, NOTHING, not even Star Wars or Star Trek merchandising, ever equalled this madness!

Many Bond competitors popped up in pulp novels as well, characters like Matt Helm, Modesty Blaise, George Smiley, Harry Palmer and others too numerous to mention. Movie rivals were ""Arabesque"", Blaise, Our Man Flint, Helm, George Smiley and Alec Leames, Harry Palmer and others, including a substandard comedy duo, Allen and Rossi, doing a piece of swill parody called ""The Last of the Secret Agents"". Even the gruesome, lowest common denominator sitcom, ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", parodied Bond. It was incredible!

BTW, did you know that Auric Goldfinger was Russian and was actually working for SMERSH? Well, now you know! All in all, a movie with few faults in a period when good movie mystery/adventures were actually just getting revived as a genre, (""Charade"", ""Arabesque"", ""Our Man Flint"".) This baby could easily be called the King of Them All!",1041120000,,3609,5.033500837520938
715310,5,630365147X,"It's the third in the series, but this is *the* definitive Bond movie. This was the first movie to establish many of the things we associate with Bond, like the car, the theme song, the crazed villain, and an out-of-this-world plot to eliminate the U.S. gold reserves in Fort Knox. As such, this movie sets the template for all the rest of the movies in the series. Shirley Bassey's theme for the movie is a classic and one of the best from all the movies. This DVD edition has some nice extras that take you behind the scenes as well. If you only have one Bond movie in your collection, this has to be it.",1041033600,,606,4.278260869565218
715311,4,630365147X,"The story has Bond contending with Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy European industrialist who looks to be cornering the world supply of gold.  Only the US reserve at Fort Knox seems out of his reach, but Goldfinger has plans for that problem.  Bond first meets Goldfinger when he catches the super-villain cheating at cards in Miami.  Then he challenges Goldfinger to a friendly game of golf (friendly because Bond allows the cheating to go on), which leads to a break-in at Goldfinger's refinery in the alps.  Captured by Goldfinger, Bonds manages to convince the bad-guy to keep him alive, if only to determine how much Bond has learned of Goldfinger's mysterious ""Operation Grand Slam"".  (Goldfinger's ill-fated decision to spare Bond caps a scene in which 007 and Foe share the most memorable dialog of any bond flick ""You expect me to talk?""; ""Why no Mr. Bond, I expect you to DIE!"").
So much of ""Goldfinger"" was recycled for latter Bond films (especially the horrible ""View to a Kill"" which essentially recycled the plot - only substituting Christopher Walken for Gert Frobe, Silicon Valley for Fort Knox and a blimp for Goldfinger's private jet) that it's easy to take its thrills for granted.  The biggest thrill of all is how the film is like an attempt to film Bond as if it were directed by Hitchkock - the most obvious signs are the score (an edgy orchestral triumph that more than hints Hitchkock's Bernard Herrman), the surprise twist of Goldfinger's (which requires Bond to think fast and w/o the benefit of his gadgets) and a raft of sexually-charged jokes which seem unusually suggestive for the rest of the series - e.g. the laser slowly creeping up 007's crotch; Bond's response when first learning Pussy Galore's name (""I must be dreaming!""); and the famous masculinity-challenging karate-match between Galore and Bond (nowhere else in the series does Bond learn that the way to a woman's heart is found after a total thrashing).  The villain's rotund shape, suggestive of Hitchkock's famous profile, is probably the strongest sign.  The flick jazzes things up with some fun gadgets (including the famous Aston Martin) but knows to keep Bond in trouble (the car doesn't save him from capture) and a wicked-bad henchmen named Odd-Job who lets a razor-edge Derby do his talking for him.  Whether you buy by Hitch-theory or not, this is still one Bond-flick that can't be missed.",1040774400,,2392,4.930348258706467

Later, Goldfinger's name is explained as his interest for gold is revealed, and Bond later learns that Goldfinger is targeting the world's economy and planning to rob the world's biggest bank, along with an ""Operation: Grandslam"".

715315,5,630365147X,"""Goldfinger"" was the third movie in the Bond series.  This movie set the standard for the Bond genre, and is generally regarded as one of the best Bond films, if not the best.
Gadgetry goes high-tech in this movie, and will stay with Bond in every film from this point forward.  In this movie we have a cutting laser.  Very impressive technology for 1964 when the laser was still a very new device.  A lot of poetic license was used for this special effect since even visible light lasers can barely be seen under most circumstances, and high power cutting lasers can't be seen at all.
Sean Connery appears very confident in this film.  His style of Bond is well developed by this point and remains the standard by which all other actors playing Bond are measured.  Most men at some point in their lives (and perhaps some women too!) want to be the James Bond portrayed by Sean Connery in this movie.
There are some of the coolest gadgets in this movie.  The Aston-Martin DB-5 has to be the best.  Everyone needs a car with machine guns, a smoke screen and an ejection seat (which only covers a few of the neat features).  Apparently, you do not want an Aston-Martin near a Ford Mustang, as Tilly Masterson found out.  Oddjob's hat, while low tech, presaged the martial arts movies of the 70s.  The cargo plane with the Boeing 747 style front end was very interesting.  Goldfinger's model of Fort Knox was very good.  Goldfinger also provided the best way to get rid of a body in the 60s.  One detail I had missed on previous viewings of this movie was the license plate on Goldfinger's car.  How could I have missed that?
The first portion of the movie provides two pieces of information.  First, Goldfinger loves gold.  Second, Goldfinger has something going, but what?  The second portion of the movie begins when it's revealed that Goldfinger plans to attack Fort Knox.  Goldfinger would be very brave, or very stupid, to attack Fort Knox.  But even that's not the end of the plot.  Goldfinger plans on setting off a nuclear bomb in Fort Knox to contaminate the U.S. gold reserves, making Goldfinger's gold even more valuable.  I guess you can never be too rich.  Fortunately James Bond is in all the right places at all the right times, though he risks death more than once in the process.
The locales become more exotic with each Bond movie.  This time we get to go to Switzerland, England, and exotic Kentucky (well, Fort Knox is pretty exotic).  Being on location adds a lot of realism to these films.
Added to the film are a variety of extras that you get with the DVD.  As with any of these extras, some you'll find interesting, most not, but they come at no extra charge (other than having to pay more for the DVD than a VHS tape).
This movie is a lot of fun.  Grab yourself a bowl of popcorn, sit back and spend a couple of hours in a world and a time that may feel like long ago, but really isn't.",1037750400,9,2910,4.4517958412098295
715316,5,630365147X,"Oh, to have lived in the 1960s, when a great Bond film came out Every. Single. Year.  ""Goldfinger"" represents the artistic nirvana of the James Bond series, before Connery lost interest in the role, when his powers as 007 were at their greatest.
""Goldfinger"" has an interesting two-part plot structure in which Auric Goldfinger is not actually revealed to be a mega-villain until the second half.  The first 55 minutes involve luscious locales, a couple of shocking death sequences (most notably Tilly Masterson's death by hat mere minutes after her entry into the film), and the funniest golf game in history (until the advent of Tony Soprano).  Once the scene shifts to Kentucky, and Goldfinger's plan is revealed, Bond has little to do except lounge around in polo shirts or say things like ""He blew a fuse"".  Thanks to the new DVD box set, even 40 years later it's instantly understandable why half the world's men want to be Sean Connery.
The special edition DVD is one of the best in the series.  Unlike ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia..."", there are two audio commentary tracks.  The first, produced years ago for the laserdisc, features edited sound bites from director Guy Hamilton and other cast members.  The second, made for the DVD, has clips only from crewmembers (beware the misleading print on the back cover), and thus there's plenty of time for Bond expert John Cork to make some interesting scholarly points about how dated the Ian Fleming novels are, and what elements of Bonds character did not survive the 1970s.  Indeed from this track you learn a lot more about the original ""Goldfinger"" novel, and you'll hear opinions as to why the story works better as a movie.  These are worthy points and they set the commentary track above the cut-and-paste variety.
The two ""documentaries"" are also above-average.  The making-of feature, narrated by Patrick Macnee, features the fall-off-the-couch laughing screen test of Theodore Bikel as Goldfinger... evidently playing the role as a college professor!  The second feature is all about the marketing of ""Goldfinger"".  There are some awesome finds in here, such as the picture of a fat Prince Charles riding in a toy Aston Martin DB-5, or the Vicks commercial featuring Harold Sakata demolishing an American suburb with his persistent cough.  There's also a truly dreadful 1964 US promotional film, with grainy black-and-white footage from the movie and the snarkiest voice-over ever.  ""Looks like he passed the audition.""

The prologue kicks things off as James blows up storage tanks for a drug runner and terrorist financier. He then renews aquaintances with a belly dancer but is rudely interrupted in a shocking bathtub encounter with an assassin.
James is then contacted by Felix Leiter to tail Auric Goldfinger, an industrialist suspected of illegally moving gold bullion overseas. James sabotages Goldfinger's game of cheating at gin rummy, and in the process seduces his employee, Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton). But Masterson pays the price via skin suffocation (during filming extreme care was taken to ensure Ms. Eaton did not suffer the same fate) and it becomes more a personal vendetta for James, despite the disapproval of M.
After getting a gadget-studded Aston Martin by Q - who bristles when James suggests one of his devices must be some kind of joke - James tails Goldfinger to Geneva and spies on his vast, out-of-the-way factory headquarters. But someone else is also in the area - a woman with a lethal grudge against Goldfinger. And when the ensuing wild chase ends, the woman dies and James is strapped on a table with an industrial laser ready to change his reputation as a ladies man.
But James bluffs his way into making Goldfinger think he is better off alive than dead, and thus he is able to accompany the arrogant criminal on his master plan - a plan aided by Red China as well as The Syndicate.  When it is explained to the varied Syndicate mugs who help Goldfinger with the necessary equipment supply, it leads to their death by lethal gas (one of the most effective scenes in the entire Bond opus).
But James plays the charm game on Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore - ""I must have appealed to her maternal instincts."" He must have, for Goldfinger's plan goes picture perfect, then collapses in fragments. But the master criminal pulls a perfect switcheroo and escapes, in time to confront James and Galore one final time onboard a private jet bound for Washington.
The film brims with memorable scenes, including a terrifically funny ""what kept you?"" scene where James is trying desperately to disarm a bomb, and Felix Lieter calmly switches the off button.",1028073600,2,2556,4.985948477751757
715391,5,630365147X,"This is where the James Bond series really began, although I absolutely loved From Russia With Love, Goldfinger made Sean Connery the amazing agent 007, not only is he a seducing character but he's a joker too, in fact in the first 2 movies James seemed much more disciplined but in this one M has to refrain him and keep him under control. This and Diamonds are Forever have to be some of the funniest films of the whole series, but anyways to the plot..
Auric Goldfinger is clean as CIA is concerned but they have reason to believe he's in a criminal plot, his plot as reveiled to James Bond is to break into Fort Knox, but he doesn't plan to steal the gold, he wants to set off a radioactive bomb making the gold unvaluable and his gold more valuable, can James Bond stop him in time? I'm not telling ;-) see the movie!!! :-P",1027036800,,828,4.280254777070064
715392,4,630365147X,"This film starts with James Bond 's trip to Miami to investigate Auric Goldfinger (an exotic locale for many in the audience). The purpose is to examine the suspected illegal trade in gold bullion, which contravenes the official monopoly, and can affect the currencies of the Free World. Gold, like diamonds, is produced in South Africa to benefit their mine owners and political allies.

It starts by showing Goldfinger cheating at cards: he's not a gentleman! This is a sign of a villain. The actor was chosen to match the description in the novel, not for political correctness. Bond arranges a golf match, flashes a gold bar, and out-cheats the cheater (to show moral superiority?). Would any secret agent act in such a manner? Following Goldfinger to Switzerland, Bond discovers the means used to smuggle gold - like in ""The French Connection"". Discovery leads to action, and a car chase, then capture. Like other such scenes, it fills up time but does not advance the plot. This chase is without dialogue, so you can read into it what you will. (I wonder if this chase was copied from the Keystone Kops?) The film then shows an industrial laser, a novelty at the time, being used in violation of Federal safety regulations.

Bond is flown to Baltimore, avoids Customs, then arrives in Kentucky. Normal prosaic life forms a background to villainy, as in a Hitchcock movie. We see the squadron that will play a part in the attack on Fort Knox. While it may be impossible to quickly steal all this gold, there is another way to make it unavailable to America, and cause the price of gold to skyrocket. Manipulating the supply, whether of oil or electricity, can be very profitable when there is no substitute. The criminals who help in this scheme are paid off then their job is done. The vehicles used tell of corporate placement. To reflect changing political relations, the other villains in this film are Red Chinese.

The squadron flies over and releases the binary nerve gas (a proposed weapon of war at the time, like SDI today). The nuclear device is then planted in the bowels of Fort Knox. Of course, this scheme is foiled by the superhuman action of James Bond. The gold supply of America, and the Free World, are saved from economic catastrophe.

Henry A. Zeiger's book ""Ian Fleming The Spy Who Came in With the Gold"" provides a literary analysis in the last chapter. Read it to understand Fleming's novels. These stories only work if you don't think about the plot.
Watching this 1965 film is eerie after 9/11/2001. Foreign conspirators exploding a dirty bomb to damage and terrorize America? Aided by those who learned to fly in America? Controlled by a wealthy and evil foreigner to profit from the disaster? Using a poison gas? How incredible in those days!",1024358400,,2776,4.777083333333334

Connery is more comical and more daring with the beautifull ladies most of all Shirley Eaton in her bathing suit, such a sexy lady and sexy voice, love her facial reactions and grin. The lady pilots are beautifull and Guy Hamilton directs his first and best bond film. Goldfingers obsession with gold, money, power, selfishness and other unconcern for people to the point of killing his own workers to save himself makes him the best villian.

715441,5,630365147X,"Is GOLDFINGER the best of all the James Bond movies? Arguably yes. DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE are better ""espionage"" thrillers, and THUNDERBALL and several others make better use of their locations. Honor Blackman, as Pussy Galore, has the best one-liner of any Bond Girl, but she is also the least feminine Bond Girl ever (except for Grace Jones, as Mayday, who makes Ms. Blackman seem like a blushing debutante).
GOLDFINGER achieves a perfect mix of all the ""Bond elements"" of action, adventure, style, girls, gadgets, and camp, to be the most memorable of the series.
The film flows seamlessly. We KNOW that Shirley Bassey's musical warning,""Pretty girl, beware of his heart of gold"" is for the unlucky Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton), whose gold-paint-covered body provided one of the most dramatic pop-culture images of the 60's. And we can accept the (otherwise ridiculous) idea that a fat man with a laser, a solid gold Rolls, and an atomic bomb is planning to rob Fort Knox in the company of his mute Korean Chauffeur who can crush golf balls in his fists and decapitate statues with his razor-rimmed bowler hat.
Camp is like Tabasco. You need just the right amount. The comedy in GOLDFINGER never detracts from the drama. The silly Chauffeur is a stone killer, and the movie never lets you forget it. The fat man may be a gentleman on the golf links, but he doesn't expect Bond to talk, he expects him to die, after all. You might chuckle at the repartee, but in the end you cheer when Goldfinger gets his.
Sean Connery's martini dry wit is never more evident and never more effective than in this picture:
""Champagne without ice? My dear girl, that's as bad as listening to The Beatles without earmuffs.""
Rightfully so, this picture is considered an early ""peak"" in the Bond canon. Not until Pierce Brosnan has anyone else come close to capturing Connery's off the cuff wit and inbred grace.
This is the first great Bond ""gadget"" movie. It stars the Aston Martin DB5 ""with modifications"" that became the most famous car in the world. Like the camp humor, the gadgets add to the movie.
Sadly, that can't be said of many later Bond films (particularly some of the Roger Moore films), which became self-consciously campy and overgadgeted in bad attempts to recapture the onscreen magic of this definitive picture.

715443,5,630365147X,"Although both 1962's ""Dr. No"" and 1963's ""From Russia With Love"" were both successful James Bond outings at the box office, 1964's ""Goldfinger"" really made the series a smash hit!  Bondmania spread throughout the world and the classic title track belted out by Shirley Bassey topped the charts in both the U.S. and U.K..  No doubt about it ""Goldfinger"" was a surefire hit film destined for greatness and since 1964 it seems that none of the other Bond films  have surpassed it.
""Goldfinger"" has everything the first two Bond adventures had.  Awesome settings, colourful characters, an exciting plot, and several action sequences.  Like ""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"" also has exciting creative gadgets such as Oddjob's deadly hat, Goldfinger's powerful laser, and Bonds high tech Aston Martin.
Connery's portrayal of Bond in this film is as witty and as fresh as ever.  Foreign actor Gert Frobe plays the evil Auric Goldfinger with a bizarre menace and his evil henchman Oddjob (played by Harold Sakata) remains one of the most memorable Bond villians ever.  The Bond girls in this movie are not as attractive as Honey Ryder or Tatiana Romanova from the two previous films.  Personally I never liked Honor Blackman's portrayal of Pussy Galore she was just so evil and not very attractive (in my opinion).  Cec Linder takes the spot of Felix Leiter over for Jack Lord (from Dr. No) and although Cec plays the role well, he is not better than Lord.
Of course Bernard Lee returns as M and Lois Maxwell as Ms. Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q, only in this film he is called Q for the first time.
Goldfinger's plot is very exciting.  James Bond is sent to track down Auric Goldfinger and find out how his company, Auric Enterprises, is smuggling gold from country to country.  When James uncovers Goldfinger's plan to raid Fort Knox and destroy the U.S Gold despository it is up to him toput a stop to Goldfinger's activites once and for all.
Overall I think Goldfinger is the best Bond film ever made the plot is exciting, the characters are interesting and the action scenes are some of the best in any Bond film.

Dr. No was rough around the edges and not very interesting, but From Russia with Love was an excellent follow-up.  By Goldfinger, all the pieces were in place for the best of the Saltzman-Broccoli Bond movies.
The film is surprising in that it takes the original novel and improves on it rather than butchering it for the big screen (maybe the folks who do the Tom Clancy movies can learn a lesson from this.)  The laser scene, which replaces the buzz saw from the novel, is now an immortal part of pop culture.
EON Productions had finally mastered the pre-title sequence and the opening credits with this movie.  You have a short but exciting scene that features explosions and a battle to the death, followed by one of the most powerful and unforgettable songs ever sung for a movie.
Unlike the susbsequent Thunderball, Goldfinger's plot is short and concise.  The movie just runs under two hours, and very little camera work is wasted on building mood or atmosphere.  This movie is all fun.  Gert Frobe puts on a great performance as the over-the-top villain, and Sean Connery is at his best.  Honor Blackman puts on one of the best acting jobs by any Bond girl (although that's not a great feat.)  Harold Sakai is impressive as the villainous Odd Job, making for a formidable foe that could not be matched until the introduction of Jaws in ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""

In Miami, Bond seduces Goldfinger's gorgeous confederate Jill Masterson, who helps 007 humiliate her boss by exposing him as a cheat at cards.  For her betrayal, Jill dies a horrifying death: she is coated from head to toe in gold paint - a grisly warning sign to Bond to stay out of Goldfinger's affairs.  In a high-stakes golf game, Bond - posing as a shady character with access to a fortune in Nazi gold - again humiliates Goldfinger after finding him cheating.  Goldfinger issues one more warning to Bond to keep away by having his manservant Oddjob decapitate a statue with a razor-brimmed bowler hat.
Bond follows Goldfinger to his Swiss headquarters and encounters Tilly Masterson, the vengeful sister of Jill who is determined to assassinate Goldfinger.  Like her sister, she also dies at the hands of Oddjob.  Bond is captured and brought to Goldfinger's Kentucky estate where he discovers that his adversary is planning an outrageous scheme to increase the value of his own gold by using an atomic bomb to contaminate Fort Knox.  With time running  out, Bond manages to seduce Pussy Galore, the personal pilot of Goldfinger who alerts the US government.  Goldfinger's forces are defeated in an intense battle during which Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob and deactivate the atomic bomb with only seconds to spare.  Bond later confronts Goldfinger aboard a plane which the defeated megalomaniac has hijacked.

Sean Connery, truly the only actor to ever emulate every aspect of the James Bond persona, gives a effortless performance as the master spy James Bond.  Connery's ease to go from wetsuit to tuxedo without blinking is a testament to the James Bond appeal and desire that is within the majority of men.

Bond is called in to investigate the unusal movement of gold on the currency market with the only real lead being Goldfinger...
None of the other Bond movies truly are so enthralling as this one is, it is the figurehead of the series and will not be replaced in this reviewers opinion.

This also shows how far the times have changed. For instance, if this were the most recent Bond, I don't think they could've used the belly dancer in the opening.
Most Bond fans already know the story. If you don't, basically, the plot involves a man by the name of Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy industrialist who's bent on one thing - destroying the gold supply in Fort Knox so his supply of gold will reach values beyond limitation. And, of course, the only man who can stop him is 007.

In a recent interview, Connery said his portrayal of James Bond may have set too high a standard for the other actors to match. The same can be said for the early 007 films. With the exception of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969), it's hard to top the excitement and inventiveness of ""Goldfinger."" The villains, gadgets and locales are top notch, with Connery in splendid form.

Auric Goldfinger is one of the best Bond villians and that role was superbly played by Gert Frobe.  The plot, involving Goldfinger's plan to destroy Fort Knox, was a rather good one for an old film such as this one.  Also, Pussy Galore was quite a Bond girl--my favorite of the 60's bonds.

715595,5,630365147X,"""Goldfinger"" is the first James Bond film to become a true blockbuster.  After the first two 007 films, this third Bond adventure cemented forever the style and fun of the series.  Sean Connery is the classic action hero this time.  He gives Bond an invulnerable twinkle this time and gives the character many comic touches which lets the audience know that he's having fun.
What makes this Bond effort much more fun than the previous two films and the many after it, is the producers' effort to focus on a very inventive plot rather than the cold war espionage which was so effective in ""From Russia With Love"", and a memorable villian.  Much of the success of a particular Bond film has a lot to do with the villian in that installment.  The villian must be a challenge for Bond, and maybe even smarter.  Goldfinger is the best villian of the Bond series.  He's incredibly inventive, rich beyond our wildest imaginations, greedy, intent on world dominance, a sore loser, and a cheater at golf.  Much of the success of this film has to do with this character, so much in fact that many Bond films afterward have had a villian very close to Goldfinger's describtion, especially in the Roger Moore era.
Goldfinger wouldn't be a great Bond villian if he didn't have a wild scheme for domination of the world.  Goldfinger's scheme is so preposterous that if this weren't a Bond film we wouldn't buy it, but it works very well.  Connery's Bond is so busy fighting deadly assasins and escaping deadly traps in this installment that the movie almost feels like a roller coaster event film.  Bond's quips and amusement with the events in the film make the film more entertaining than it would be if he were playing it completely straight.
""Goldfinger"" has the best villian in the series and has been the blueprint for many Bond films since but the fun and humor here is genuine.  I don't think Bond has had a better time since.",975715200,,1920,4.631268436578171
715596,5,630365147X,"A phenomenal DVD package! In addition to a beautiful widescreen print of the most famous Bond film, you also get a DVD loaded with enough extras to keep you busy for days on end. For starters, you get a pair of entertaining  audio commentaries, two very informative documentaries --""The Making of Goldfinger"" and ""The Goldfinger Phenomenom"", dozens of still photos and the original preview trailers. Whew!! Wouldn't it be great if all DVDs were as loaded as ""Goldfinger"".
The film itself is not only the best known of all the Bonds, it is quite simply the Grandaddy of all Action Flicks. While ""From Russia with Love"" (1963) is technically a better movie (stronger plot, impeccable cast,etc.), ""Goldfinger"" blasted the Bond series into the Stratosphere when released in '64. Hollywood, of course, caught a severe case of Spy Fever and immediately spewed out a succession of imitations.(""Matt Helm"", ""Our Man Flint"" and the ""Man From U.N.C.L.E."") But ""Goldfinger"", with its rogues gallery of cartoonish villains, beautiful women, and mindblowing gadgets--most notably the Aston Martin DB 5 ""with modifications"" --- set the precedent for all that followed.
Of course, the film stars the invincible Sean Connery, who was absolutely born to portray the World's Greatest Spy. Sean hits his stride in ""Goldfinger"", but he's not alone. Gert Frobe  nearly steals the show with his over the top portrayal of the title character. No Bond villain has ever come close to Frobe's gold-thirsty meglomaniac.(Observe the documentaries or listen to the commentaries and you'll be stunned to learn that Frobe spoke little English and therefore had his lines dubbed!) Harold Sakata's Oddjob, with his deadly bowler hat, is the series' greatest henchman. Honor Blackman is truly mesmerizing in the role of Pussy Galore. (The name was almost changed to suit American audiences!) Ironically, Shirley Eaton, who had less than 10 minutes of screen time, provides one of the most everlasting images in film history. Eaton plays Jill Masterson the famous golden girl, whose semi-nude body sprayed with gold paint from head to toe, stunned film goers in '64. And last, but not least, is Shirley Bassey who belts out the most memorable of all Bond songs. What a performance! Bassey doesn't merely sing, she growls with passion.
""Goldfinger"" has aged remarkably well. Younger fans, who have grown up with the Brosnan films, will probably be satisfied with ""Goldfinger's"" generous action quotient.

""Goldfinger"", the third installment in James Bond series and the second I've ever seen, certainly lives up to it's commendable reputation. The DVD does the film splendid justice with it's slew of extras including several documentaries, a still gallery, radio spots, TV spots, original theatrical trailer, and much more. When you add in the incredible interactive menu, you've got a package sure to please.
Auric Goldfinger, the top bad guy in the film, is supposedly one of the best James Bond villains, and I can believe it. His gang of dangerous henchmen and co-villains certainly give an impressive feeling. As always, there are countless new gadgets, including the Aston Martin DB5, one of the most famous cars ever made. Many action sequences make the pace of the movie fast and entertaining, while still adding in a few scenes of explanation for good measure. Connery is much better as the suave secret agent than Roger Moore from ""Moonraker"". He seems calmer and more sophisticated than the man who would later replace him as special agent 007.
""Goldfinger"" is a classic, not only for Bond fans, but for the genre of action films itself.

715681,5,630365147X,"The Cold War. Cuba. Espionage. Missiles. Sabotage. Spies......
The many reviewers are right on target about Goldfinger being the best of the 007  films by its classiness and style. However I want to point to two things  that Goldfinger does better than any other film.
First, while ""Dr.  No"" has the closest feel to Ian Fleming's Jamaica environment and  ""From Russia with Love"" is the most realistic vis a vis the  Russians with dark realistim, Goldfinger captures the JFK/Cuba mood the  best with its opening teaser of 007 in scuba gear blowing up an  installation and then getting into a fight in a cabana over a girl. This  sets the stage for everything else that takes place---These kinds of things  were actually happening in the early 1960s and President Kennedy wanted  covert operations like this to take place. Goldfinger created a fantasy  that could be a reality for us anywhere in the world, not just in Jamaica  or in Balkans. We may think of JFK's administration as ""Camelot""  but it was actually closer to ""Cuba"", guns, commandos, sabotage,  girls and spies.
The powerful, haunting score of the modern-day Midas  propels you throughout the movie reminding you again and again that you are  in an epic encounter between good/evil and there are dangerous girls to be  had every step of the way!
I'm surprised that a lot of the reviewers  refer to the Fort Knox battle as the ""finale"". We all know it  isn't true. The film sets you up with 007 about to be rewarded by a trip to  the White House in the president's personal jet for saving the West, when  UHHO!  ""You have interfered with my plans for the last  time""--------Goldfinger in General's uniform (we saw him bug-out at  the battle earler this way and shooting some of his own men in the back to  escape, too!) has taken over the Presidential plane. Surprise! A gun  pointed at 007, a plane at 30,000 feet and a fight to the death, now  THAT------is a finale.
This is the way it should be for the mano-e-mano  fight ending--the bad guy is REALLY angered and wants to personally get the  good guy even to unreasonable lengths, Goldfinger is the first, it works,  we all like it. Bond tries to reason with him that a gun going off in a  pressurized plane is not a good idea. Goldfinger has by this time had  enough of Bond and his mouth! But today we see this ending over and over  again, its sickening. I want the good guy to see the bad guy, shoot him, in  the back if need be and stop this silliness, I digress.
Goldfinger's  surprise finale--it isn't over until its over---is what I relish most about  the film. You can't ever lower your guard fighting a guy like Goldfinger.  Then the plane is diving out of control, it drops off radar and explodes.  WOW. What has happened to Bond? Is he alive or is he dead?
We all know  the ending. Switch to the credits.....

715786,5,630365147X,"""Goldfinger"", released in 1964 is the third film of the James Bond series and like the two preceding film in the series, Goldfinger is based on Ian Fleming's novel of the same name. Sean Connery returns as  James Bond and many of the players from the first two films reprise their  roles including Bernard Lee as ""M"", Lois Maxwell as Miss  Moneypenny, and Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"". Terence Young, however,  does not return as the director in this outing, replaced by Guy  Hamiltion.
The storyline of Goldfinger represents the first time (and the  last time until ""Live and Let Die"") that a Bond film does not  involve a scheme from the evil organization SPECTRE. Instead, it appears  that Bond will be investigating what he terms a ""simple smuggling  matter"". The crime is gold smuggling and the target is rich tycoon  named Auric Goldfinger, a man Bond has had a previous and somewhat  unpleasant encounter with. Bond begins to penetrate the world of Goldfinger  and to uncover his smuggling methods, but he discovers that smuggling is  but a sideline to Goldfinger for Bond discovers that Goldfinger is planning  the greatest crime in history, to rob the gold vaults of Fort Knox!  Captured, Bond must play a deadly game to foil Goldfinger's  plans.
Goldfinger can be considered the first big budget Bond film and  the production shows it off with shooting locations in Britain, Switzerland  and, for the first time, America. Director Guy Hamilton gives Goldfinger a  much broader, brassier feel than the earlier Bonds. Shirley Bassey sets the  mood in the opening credits with her award winning redition of the  ""Goldfinger"" theme song and the mood is continued with the film  score.
Several other changes are made under Hamilton's watch. Bond's spy  gadgets make their true debut in this film, topped off with the trademark  Aston Martin loaded with a full array of weapons. The armorer Q's character  is established fully for the first time, displaying his genius for  developing the tools of spycraft and displaying his disdain for Bond and  his antics. One unusual tradition began with Goldfinger when Bond's CIA  contact Felix Leiter, played by Jack Lord in ""Dr. No"" was played  instead by Cec Linder. From this point on (until ""Licence To  Kill""), no actor ever played Felix Leiter a second time.
Despite  the changes, German actor Gert Frobe continued the tradition of ruthless,  driven villians with his excellent potrayal of the title role and Harold  Sakata played what was probably one of the ultimate evil henchmen of the  movies, the silent and deadly Oddjob.
The cast, interesting enough,  contains several actors from familiar British TV series. Shirley Eaton, who  plays Goldfinger's girlfriend Jill  Masterson, was a regular guest star on  ""The Saint"" whose title role was played by a future Bond  star  named Roger Moore. Honor Blackman, who plays Goldfinger's personal pilot  Pussy Galore (could you really get away saying that in a '60s movie?), was  well known as Cathy Gale of ""The Avengers"" a series from which a  number of its stars would appear in later Bond films.
The original Bond  formula created by Terence Young and the new elements from Guy Hamiltion  combined with a suspenseful plot, lots of action and a fine cast made  Goldfinger the strongest Bond effort to date and the results paid off quite  handsomely at the box office. Today's moviegoers will find Goldfinger  rather dated when compared to today's Bond but if one wishes to see James  Bond as he was at the height of his popularity in the 1960's, not to  mention one of the best thrillers of that decade, this is the one Bond to  own.",964137600,2,3629,4.886513157894737

The picture quality suffered a few times due to age, but the colors were fairly vivid.

When he filmed Goldfinger, Connery had firmly defined himself as James Bond, but had not yet grown tired of the role. The gadgetry is eye-popping, even to today's audiences, but does not overwhelm the entire film as many of the later Bond entries do. This is one of the few films in the series that actually improved upon the original Ian Fleming novel. Goldfinger has transcended the series and become one of the classic cult films of the 1960's. Even when viewed on a faded VHS tape, Goldfinger still manages to excite those who have seen it dozens of times.

In addition to the usual DVD extras (language selection, scene selection, theatrical trailers, etc.), this DVD edition includes still photos, TV ads, radio interviews with Sean Connery and not one, but two documentaries about Goldfinger's filming. Also, the DVD has an alternate audio track with commentary from director Guy Hamilton, Honor Blackman and set designer Ken Adam, among others with fascinating behind the scenes information. This DVD is fully loaded and is one of the best DVD's ever produced. In short, if you haven't seen Goldfinger yet, you're in store for an extra special treat when you watch the enhanced Special Edition. If you have seen the film, the DVD will magnify your appreciation of Goldfinger the next time you view it.",956534400,4,1921,4.95046439628483

715827,5,630365147X,"It's a shame that the Special Edition Bonds' were not released in chronological order, but that's about the only complaint you'll read here.
GOLDFINGER showcases Connery in his third outing, and perhaps, in  his most complete.  There are just no weaknesses: from the hot women (Pussy  Galore, the Masterson sisters), the gadgets (Bond's incredible Aston-Martin  DB 5), the villains (Auric Goldfinger, and the ominous Oddjob) to the  killer locations and action sequences, first-time Bond-director Guy  Hamilton delivers.  He not only seamlessly integrates action, comedy, and  super-cool guy-machismo in one 110-minute package, but he strengthens,  while innovating, the spy-action hybrid genre.
This DVD contains 2 very  good commentary tracks, 2 documentaries, photos, radio interviews,  trailers, etc. The start-up motion-menu is high-tech and gets you in the  Bond mood. The mono soundtrack is adequate, buy hey MGM! Remix in 5.1.  PLEASE! Picture quality is the same as the previously released DVD-version  and looks very good, but the trained eye can catch some minor inadequacies  in the print (grit, dust, etc).
All in all, GOLDFINGER ranks among the  top-5 Bond films, while enduring as a ground-breaking action film that  deserves to be called a classic in every sense of the word.",952646400,25,1291,5.4393939393939394

Those of us who made the rite of passage into  (perceived)adulthood on the heels of seeing ""Goldfinger"" must  finally admit that this is the kind of action movie they're just not going  to make anymore. First of all,there's really not that much action---after  the bang-up teaser opening,it's mostly exposition---something quite  unthinkable in today's marketplace. Consider this---after 007 finds Shirley  Eaton covered in gold,there are THREE individual segments in which Bond's  mission is discussed and instructions given---this is in the first act,mind  you. Today,they'd be past the third boat chase and into the second free-fall  from a plane in flight.""Goldfinger's"" next ""action""  highlight is a golf game---Get Out! ---but what humor and suspense it  generates---will Goldfinger discover the ball switch?It still puts me on  the edge of my seat,and I've seen it two dozen times. The greatness of this  movie lies in the powerful visual images it so casually presents---the  Golden Girl on the bed---I won't even try to describe the electricity that  went through the audience when that scene flashed on in '64(and well into  '65)---if you're too young,ask your father to tell you about it. Oh,and the  laser--you know,where it's pointed and all that---need I mention the effect  on twelve-year old boys hitherto nursed on the likes of ""Son Of  Flubber""?---and when Pussy Galore introduced herself---someone might  just as well have set off a cherry bomb in the theatre. What I'm saying  is,you had to be there. The middle-aged among us who like an occasional  express ride back to childhood will want this DVD,with all it's fabulous  extras. For those of you who missed the sixties,here is an opportunity to  understand your elders a little better---order ""Goldfinger""  today---find out what some of the excitement of our youth was all  about---chances are it will lead to a happy Bond-ing experience with  someone you love.",952128000,59,2414,5.3689839572192515
715829,5,630365147X,"""Goldfinger"" is an all-time classic. Here we see Sean Connery at his undoubted best. ""Goldfinger"" has a solid plot devised by gold-obsessed industrialist Auric Goldfinger, one of cinema's most enduring  villains, the fantastic Aston Martin DB5, one of cinema's most enduring  cars, and Oddjob, quite possibly the best henchman in the series. First  Bond girl of the film (Jill Masterson, played by Shirley Eaton) falls  victim to gold paint, Bond has to watch as an industrial laser *almost*  severs his manhood, and the thrilling finale with the Bond vs. Oddjob  battle, and Goldfinger ends his turn ""playing his golden harp"" at  35,000 feet - the most unusual demise of a Bond villain?

7853178,2,630365147X,"Hear me out! Yes, I know, there are loads and loads of iconic moments and characters, and it certainly set many of the conventions which will carry on through the series. That said, there is a whole lot wrong with this movie; furthermore, this is the one I watched most as a kid--so no, these are not the words of some lame social justice warrior.
Villain - Goldfinger. His top henchman, Oddjob, is undoubtedly cooler--and for good reason--but let's face it, that's often the case. Auric Goldfinger is interesting: boyish and conceptually esoteric, he is obsessed with gold (believe it or not). And this brings about one of the goofiest villain schemes in the entire series. Still, the scenes with him are the best parts of the movie.
Bond Girl - Pussy Galore (and two others sort of, but I'm not going to talk about them). Ugh. I'm going to give a spoiler and, yes, it is as bad as it sounds: she is practically useless until she's, well, kinda raped by James Bond...And if it wasn't for his magical penis that somehow turned her straight (in more than one sense, as it's insinuated she's a lesbian), then Goldfinger would've won in the end...
Action and Sets - Pretty good stuff. Stellar opening scene and intro credits; first memorable car chase and briefing in the Q lab. Also the first time Bond is seen doing stuff in the United States. Ah, that reminds me: there is a scene that's supposed to be set at a hotel pool in Miami. Viewing it on a modern TV, it's clearly done in a studio. Same goes for a few other parts, but not many. Beware of distractingly bad edits.
Context - Whereas in the first movie he's sent to investigate the stomping grounds of the villain and, in the second, he's essentially being tracked down by the villains, this one shows Bond actively pursuing the eponymous baddie. He even hangs out with him a bunch of times! So yes, it's a refreshing change of pace for the focus to shift onto the main antagonist in this way.
Ageing - As mentioned, the final step of the rising action is uncomfortably misogynistic, even for James Bond's standards. He forces himself on women many more times throughout the series, but this is easily the worst of it. I would give it four stars (just like everyone else) if it wasn't for that one, seemingly integral plot detail.",1523577600,,2287,4.553398058252427

7853185,5,630365147X,"Goldfinger, the third film of the Sean Connery era truly changed the James Bond franchise.  Based on the seventh novel by Ian Fleming of the same name, this film built up on the momentum of the previous two and added the final motifs related to the franchise in becoming the quintessential James Bond film.

James Bond begins an investigation of bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger in Miami, at first observing and then upsetting his cheating scheme at a game of gin rummy which has deadly consequences for a recently met love interest.  Back in London, Bond learns that Goldfinger is suspected of smuggling gold internationally and is task to figure out how he does it.  After playing (and defeating) Goldfinger in a game of golf, Bond follows Goldfinger and his henchman Oddjob to Switzerland where he discovers how Goldfinger smuggles his gold as well as a meeting with a Chinese agent.  However, Bond is captured and set up to be cut in half by a industrial laser but saves himself by lying about MI6 knowing about his plan with the Chinese agent.  Goldfinger brings Bond to Kentucky, where on the surface he is setting up an operation to steal all the gold in Fort Knox but in fact it is to make it radioactive by setting off a dirty bomb.  Bond persuades Goldfingers personal pilot, Pussy Galore, to notify the FBI and Army about the attack and interrupt it through Bond is locked in the vault with the bomb and Oddjob.  Bond is able to electrocute Oddjob then struggled to disarm the bomb only for a nuclear specialist to arrive and turn it off.  The film ends with Bond on a flight to Washington when Goldfinger comes out of the cockpit, but the resulting gun battle sees Goldfinger sucked out of plane due to explosive decompression while Bond and Pussy parachute safety to some secluded woods.

Though my synopsis of the plot is pretty basic, Goldfingers was clearly the best of these early Bond films.  With a mix of action, espionage, and various locations, the plot was tight allowing both Connery and Gert Frobe (playing the titular Goldfinger) to deliver great performances with the latters becoming the standard future Bond villains would be measured.  This film completed the motifs that would define the franchise: the Bond theme songs introduced over the title sequence began with the classic Goldfinger sung by Shirley Bassey, the Bond quote Shaken, not stirred was first spoken in this film, and Bonds heavy reliance on technology.

Goldfinger is considered the classic installment of the franchise, in fact because of its huge success in 1964 that its script would be the template for films to come as well the reliance on technology that would be overused in installments to come.  However, neither of those factors takes away the luster of his film which is always in discussion for the best in the entire franchise even 50+ years later.",1513296000,,2857,4.8040816326530615
