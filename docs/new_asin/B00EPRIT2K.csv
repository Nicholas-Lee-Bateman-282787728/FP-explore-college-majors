5933672,5,B00EPRIT2K,"I was very glad to buy a recording of Vaughan William's fantasy so beautifully played and recorded on bluray. The concert hall is awesome and is a big plus!
The Pastoral symphony is one of my favorites and have many recordings of it,but this one reminds me of the one I have in LP by Igor Markevitch which I treasure as my best.
A very good buy.",1380931200,5,345,4.164179104477612

8608241,5,B00EPRIT2K,"I find the Ralph Vaughan Williams ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis"" to be a lovely start of this live concert. It's right up there with the best performances IMO. One of the advantages of Blu-Ray Disc concerts is to have your cake and eat it too. So, you can watch and associate a particular sound with the spotlighted instrument, and thus learn differences between various woodwinds, e.g. With BD, you still have the great audio alongside HD video.
The Dvorak op. 99 songs are again lovely, with the option to follow along in English, German, or French (subtitles). The location, Prague Castle is lovely as ever, shown at times throughout the concert. The Beethoven 6th is again quite lovely and well recorded. Still, it is a pastoral walk as led by Rattle, lacking the Sturm und Drang that some prefer. I appreciate it both ways; variation is the spice of life. Technically, the concert could hardly be better, and the Berliner players are wonderful.",1439078400,3,957,4.771084337349397

8608243,5,B00EPRIT2K,"At first I missed the grandeur of a Karajan, but I think that's half the intention.  Instead, Rattle emphasizes lightness, weighting phrases to let them build organically.  It all comes together when the woodwinds leap into action in a blissful evocation of spring.  Did the Tallis Fantasia just slightly miss a touch of awe?  Perhaps.  But it makes up for it with natural musicality-- this is Rattle's gift that he seems to enjoy sharing with us.  ""It can also be played this way.""",1392508800,,482,4.746987951807229
8608244,4,B00EPRIT2K,"This is certainly an enjoyable recording - a concert by artists of the highest calibre in an attractive historical venue, the Spanish Hall in Prague Castle.  It's to be valued more for the sense of occasion that for any individual interpretation, though.  Simon Rattle has not recorded much VW - none of the symphonies, so far as I know - and doesn't seem specially attuned to it - the work comes across rather sectionalised without the commanding arch it should present, and does in the classic performances by Adrian Boult and others - including the great Czech Karel Anerl, though most of the Prague audience would be too young to remember his performances of the work in Prague with the Czech Philharmonic back in the 1960s.  But the wonderful playing by the Berlin strings can be joyfully appreciated.

Eight of Dvok's ten Biblical Songs are presented here, three orchestrated by Dvok and the remainder I assume in the orchestrations by Vilm Zemnek. The complete set of ten, including the two remaining songs, both orchestrated by Dvok himself, were included in a concert the same artists gave in Berlin and issued on CD on Deutsche Grammophon - to get the complete work you should buy this CD as well.  (or just download the two missing songs - see http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007X0TQ32/ref=dm_ws_sp_ps_dp?ie=UTF8&qid=1391342772&sr=8-1)  It seems rather odd that, if they were not going to include all the songs, the two omitted should be among those Dvok chose to orchestrate himself.  The details given with the DVD don't warn that the set is not complete or give details on the orchestrations, while the notes with with the DGG CD imply wrongly that all the songs were orchestrated by Zemnek.  It is also not clear whether the missing songs were given at the concert but omitted from the DVD, or if the concert itself only included eight of the songs.

The Beethoven is quite beautifully played by all concerned, tho again the interpretation is comfortable rather than up with greatest recordings of the work.

The picture is clear, the camera shots of the room constant and maybe stunning.

I think the reservations about the missing songs, the overall interpretation and the documentation take away one star, buy this is a varied and attractive program, enjoyed by the audience in Prague and easy to enjoy for the listener / viewer.",1391299200,4,2349,4.966836734693878
8608245,5,B00EPRIT2K,"I have fallen in love with these. Now, I have discovered that there were several made prior to this one. I want to own them all. Since I live in a small city in the Midwest, I do not have the opportunity to see such elegant surroundings, but I can vicariously participate through the DVDs. Since my family does not like my music, I wear my headphones. I am thus able to shut out my sometimes chaotic world of family and be transported into the wonderful world of classical music.

Need I say it? I crave this stuff!",1387411200,,515,4.255102040816326
8608246,2,B00EPRIT2K,coral section was too long.  coral selections were without any particular merit.  Too much spent photo scanning the hall; too little time on the musicians.,1384214400,,155,5.16
8608247,5,B00EPRIT2K,"Of all the classical Blu-rays I've viewed, this one has to be the most relaxing. I expect it will retain that distinction until a Delius disc is released. (Perhaps that's wishful thinking. Is Delius being performed anymore?)

The program, as disparate as it appears to be, actually consists of highly complementary works by very different composers. All are gentle, introspective and inspired by folk music themes.

The first work, Vaughan Williams' ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis"" starts things off on a magical note with long threads of gorgeous sound, and the spell is never broken. It's beautifully done. Bravo, as always, to the Berlin Philharmonic (arguably the world's greatest orchestra), which here seems to feature many new faces.

Next up are Dvorak's ""Biblical Songs."" If you're familiar with his opera ""Rusalka"" or at least its famous aria, the ""Song to the Moon,"" then you have a sense of what you'll experience here. These songs are much earthier than, say, those of Richard Strauss, even though they focus on the heavens. There are 10 songs lasting about 25 minutes, and they are done full justice by the lovely mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena (who happens to be married to conductor Simon Rattle). She's very expressive, facially as well as vocally, and conveys great warmth.

I should mention here that the Blu-ray's audio balance favors the orchestra, so there are a couple of moments where Kozena's voice is somewhat swamped. Also, the hall (more about it later) is quite reverberant, but one's ears adjust quickly. I'm sure this venue posed a major challenge for the video's sound engineers.

Of course, the likelihood of these songs being captured on hi-def video again is remote, so if they are of interest, there's no need to look further than this heartfelt performance.

The final piece is Beethoven's 6th Symphony. This highly familiar work -- my favorite among Beethoven's symphonies -- receives an excellent reading here.

The setting for this concert is the Spanish Hall at Prague Castle. It's quite stunning, with elaborate ornamentation that goes on for days. The video director is understandably unable to resist lingering over the sculpture-filled, gold-leafed walls and the huge chandeliers featuring busts and cherubs.

This performance was captured in May, only months before the Blu-ray's release. The picture quality is perhaps the best I've ever seen. The technology obviously continues to improve, because just when you think the picture can't get any sharper, it does. The audio quality, save for the couple of minor issues mentioned above, is very satisfying.

Not long before this performance, Rattle announced that he would be leaving his post with the Berlin Philharmonic in 2018, at which point he will have conducted the orchestra for 16 years. It's been a wonderfully symbiotic relationship, and he'll be greatly missed. Here's hoping EuroArts captures many of their remaining performances together and releases them on Blu-ray.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I was provided with a review copy of this particular disc, although I've purchased many EuroArts discs (as well as those of other classical music labels) over the years.",1383436800,12,3219,5.304518664047151
8608248,5,B00EPRIT2K,"This concert from Prague continues the tradition of the annual celebratory concerts celebrating the creation of this famous orchestra. Each year the concert is played in a specially chosen venue and the concert program usually has a significant connection with that venue. In this case the connection is through the music of Dvorak.

The concert opens with a performance of the Vaughan Williams Thomas Tallis Fantasia for strings. The strings are divided into the main body and a smaller body of players which relates back to the concept of the concerto grosso form of construction. This is a very major work from the last century and is an obvious masterpiece although one suspects that the Prague audience may have been unfamiliar with it. Rattle coaxes and receives from his players a performance of tremendous subtlety, a feature which is made apparent right from the opening phrase. The Berlin players respond wonderfully and one wonders just how many of them will have been enjoying the music for the first time. Expressions and glances of pleasure are caught flitting between players during the performance at various points. This is not a red hot emotional performance such as those given by Barbirolli or Silvestri on CD for example but it is more emotionally engaging than some of the cooler versions such as the magisterial Boult. In short, a fine and satisfying performance of some real perception.

The 10 Biblical Songs by Dvorak are a late work and the songs are short biblical settings amounting to about 30 minutes. They are deeply personal statements and are beautifully and radiantly sung with passion and commitment by Magdalena Kozena, otherwise known as Mrs Rattle. This is a section of the concert that communicated directly to the Prague audience which, no doubt, enjoyed the experience of hearing it sung in Czech as written. The subtitles will clearly help to make this an equally enjoyable experience for all those not fluent in Czech. The audience gave this performance the first of the concert's standing ovations.

The concert concludes with an equally subtle performance of Beethoven's Pastoral symphony. This is a traditional performance in the sense that speeds are more relaxed than might be expected with the peasants being on their best behaviour, the storm not being too threatening and with the conclusion providing a comforting glow of satisfaction. This could not really be described as a period aware performance nor as a taut and scaled down BPO performance like Abbado's in Rome, also available on Euroarts. Nor was it as heavy weight and idiosyncratic as Thielemann's with the VPO. Rattle played it straight with much detail of phrasing brought out to satisfying effect. In many ways it was much the same type of performance as that given to the opening Vaughan Williams and with all the same virtues. The audience loved it and rose to their feet for a sustained ovation which was continuing as the recording faded out.

The recording delivers very crisp imaging with good colour. The camera work provides detail without being invasive. The sound is full and satisfying and is provided in DTS 5.1 and stereo.

This is a very satisfying concert with plenty of program interest. It is a high quality production and I would suggest that it would be well worth considering for purchase providing a suitably rewarding experience.
