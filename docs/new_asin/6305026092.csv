951865,5,6305026092,"I've had this movie on VHS for years. I didn't really think anything of it when I brought it home from the library the first time, but within twenty minutes I fell in love with the characters and the plot. There is love and there is redemption. I'm glad to finally find it on DVD here. Good buy for fantasy/magic buffs.",1355529600,,319,4.245901639344262
951866,3,6305026092,"A mediocre modern-version remake of the Jungle Book. The story is rushed through, although actions for the voiceovers for the elephant Bono (Robert Quarry), and the tiger Sabre (Ross Hagen) the monkey Mantoo (Jenny Pulos) are good. Otherwise nothing really groundbreaking here.

They could have made more of the animals in the movie.

The villains where pretty cardboard, but the friendship between Krishna (Asif Mohammed Seth) and Anna (Leah Moreno) was sweet.

All in all an entertaining one and half hours, but one of the lesser versions of the Jungle Book saga.",1101600000,,565,5.119565217391305
