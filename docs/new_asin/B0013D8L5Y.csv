3102996,3,B0013D8L5Y,"First off, I like Marc Dacascos, he's usually pretty good in his movies. He's good in this film too, but Alien Agent suffers from a miniscule budget and a re-treaded plot. The Hidden, Dark Breed, The Silencers are just a few of the movies that have used the ""Alien Cop"" motif; and had bigger budgets.

All in all, Alien Agent is a mildly pleasing diversion, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.",1207958400,9,406,4.561643835616438
3102997,2,B0013D8L5Y,"This movie was good enough to sit through while doing other things, but it wasn't good enough that I'd recommend setting time out for it.  The storyline was good, but it was far too cliche.  It didn't captivate me or excite me.  It was something to do while passing some time and nothing more.  The acting was pretty good, and so were the sets, but much of the writing was far too predictable.

Also, the storyline rules seemed to change part of the way through.  In the beginning, Isis was running from Riker, but halfway through, she was chasing him and knew psychically where to find him.  While his power was draining the longer he was on earth, none of the other aliens suffered that problem.

And finally, the last scene was confusing.  I didn't know where they were and I'd forgotten who this particular antagonist was.  It could have been left out altogether and the movie would have been no better or worse.

So, if it's on the movie channel and you like sci-fi and you've nothing better to do for an hour and a half, go for it.  It'll at least keep you interested.  Otherwise, give it a pass or tape it for when you're looking for a marathon veg-out in front of the TV.",1204243200,9,1179,4.377880184331797

8249851,4,B0013D8L5Y,"Hi Folks, I thought I recognized the 'CHAIRMAN', from the Food Network channels, 'Iron Chef Challenge'. I was correct, his name is Mark Dacascos, and he has a very impressive background in martial arts and has won at least 6 international first place titles. He has quite a few movies under his belt. Albeit most of them 'B' movies but hey, how many of us get to be in any kind of movies? Mark has to be very intelligent also, he speaks 4 languages fluently. So I bought this out of curiosity. He does a creditable job acting. I wonder if he really does those multiple back flips and lands on his feet on the stage in the beginning of the 'Iron Chef America Challenge'. By all reports of his talents I think he probably does.",1401494400,,725,4.338235294117647
8249852,5,B0013D8L5Y,"All of his movies I really enjoy watching over and over again, I truly enjoy watching his movies. He is a great martial artist and very good looking, he has a comical side and pulls that off too. He just a lot of funny to watch in whatever he does. I do wish he'd do some more movies.",1388016000,,284,3.913793103448276
8249853,5,B0013D8L5Y,I  really enjoyed this movie. The acting was good along with the directing and the special effects  in my opinion,1375315200,,113,4.6
8249854,3,B0013D8L5Y,"I missed the first part of this movie; but stumbling across it in the middle of the night on the Sci Fi channel, and liking Mark Dacascos, I decided to give it a try.

There's some good martial arts in this film; and that, and the action, are better than the storyline. It's not a TERRIBLE movie. Interesting premise, in which invading aliens apparently use their superior technology to attack various greasy-spoon DINERS throughout the state. (Note: The aliens might have been vanquished earlier, had they decided to EAT the diner food instead of blowing those establishments to pieces.)",1303862400,,588,4.9393939393939394
8249855,4,B0013D8L5Y,"I watched this on Syfy one night and while I love Syfy they sometimes have cheesy movies with bad, bad effects. I tuned in late so I didn't see the beginning.

Finding it cheap at amazon I figured why not buy it? Althought its not the best movie ever it did have a good plot. I'm a fan of Mark Dacascos and thought he was really hot. Billy Zane also plays a convincing hillbillie who later becomes the alien General and watching his transformation into the other role was just awesome.

But the real reason I like this movie is the fact that the alien agent picks up a teenage girl who has a major crush on him. I think the actress who played teenage Julie also plays on the newest Power Ranger series but I won't swear to that. I don't really care either to be honest. lol

I've always been drawn to older men having a relationship with a younger woman and even though their relationship was just a friendship they did kiss and that was sweet!

The movie's ending felt like it was the set up for a tv show but I guess that idea fell flat. Too bad. I would've watched it.",1301961600,,1071,4.184466019417476
8249856,3,B0013D8L5Y,"Mostly a martial arts film with a beautiful female alien,
all flame tattooed  with a chain whip
and an innocent young girl who fixates on the agent hero
who is trying to prevent the ancient race with the dying sun from
moving in and taking over Earth. Really with global warming
no sane alien race would want this place?
It appears in the end he manages to blow up the gate ...
another 'B' sci fi film that isn't too bad.
I enjoyed it.",1211068800,11,435,4.178571428571429
