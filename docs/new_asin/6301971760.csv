7818484,5,6301971760,"A great collection of four fabulous giant movies in DVD's that will allow endless watching for anyone who cherishes great movie history.

I particularly love the ""The Thomas Crown Affair"".  I liked the remake with Pierce Bronson and Rene Russo, but loved this original movie with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. I was able to relive the moments of watching the movie for the first time as a teenager.

I am glad to see movies, like these, remastered and available for our enjoyment.",1371340800,,482,4.783132530120482
7818485,4,6301971760,"This is the second United artist 4 DVD set I bought. Both were good and worth buying.

All 4 DVDs in this set played perfect with great color and sound.

Rocky won best picture in 1976 and was nominated for ten Academy awards. Rocky is about a Philadelphia non rated club heavyweight who gets his once in a lifetime chance. The heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Kree selects Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone)to fight as all the top 10 contenders are either grossly overweight and out of training or are unwilling to fight. Its the fourth of July and Rocky as a white ""Italian Stallion"" is selected as Christopher Columbus was an Italian.

Rocky has none of the boxing skills Apollo has and is a super underdog but a man with 5o years boxing fighting experience ( Burgess Meridith... was nominated for supporting actor Oscar) asks to be his trainer/manager. Rocky trains relentlessly and gets his body into an iron condition and can spit nails. He gains speed,endurance and devastating punching power as he practices punching slabs of beef in a meat locker. Awesome! He fights Apollo and goes the full 15 rounds. Rocky finally gets a broken nose and his face completely broken/slashed up. Apollo gets so many body blows he is bleeding internally with smashed ribs and kidney. Apollo wins with a split decision and vows no rematch. NOT! There were 5 later Rockies. The first Rocky a classic movie of an underdog making good. A great heart warming ending. I loved this movie. 5 stars

The Great Escape was about a true event in 1943 where habitual escape artist Allied prisoners of war are collected and put into one ""escape proof"" prison. Not! Three tunnels are dug and 76 prisoners escape. However the NAZI SS and Gestapo capture and execute 50 of the escapees. A few are captured by the regular army and set back to the prison camp. Several make good their escape.

Great plot, adventure, color and sound. The viewer gains great empathy with the hardships the prisoners endure. There are great attempted escapes by motorcycle, a German trainer airplane, and train , Successful escapes by row boat and bicycle. Help from the French resistance and a three German officers getting massacred by the French resistance saving an Australian escapee.

Lots of action. I loved the motorcycle scene with Steve McQueen and the German trainer plane scene with James Garner and Donald Pleasence playing a blind escapee.  Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson,James Coburn, and James Donald also star. A super great DVD. I loved it. 5 stars plus!

The Thomas Crown affair was also with Steve McQueen as a multi millionaire who engineers a big bank robbery for kicks. He doesn't need the money. An insurance investigator ( Fay Dunaway)is out to get him but both fall in love. Thomas Crown does another bank holdup and knows his girl friend/insurance investigator will betray him to the police. A super great ending in a cemetery, black Rolls Royce and a jet flying away. I won't ruin the great ending. A great movie 4 1/2 stars.

West side story had great color and sound. The movie won 10 Academy awards including best picture in 1961. Natalie Wood stars.
The movie was about two gangs fighting in the west side of NYC... the Sharks and the Jets and the police getting involved. There is a classic love story like Romeo and Juliet but in a 1950ish NYC  street alley environment. Innocent blood and death is shed. Parts INMO were great but I am not into musicals. 3 1/3 stars. For those who like musicals with lots of singing and dancing around in the early parts will like this movie much more. Many say this movie was the best musical of all times.",1329868800,,3643,4.73186119873817
