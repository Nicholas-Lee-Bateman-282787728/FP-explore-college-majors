Directed by Paul Landres

""Trigger happy"" sheriff Dan Beattie (George Montgomery) is asked to step down by the townsfolk who want to have a quieter, safer town. So Dan reluctantly moves further west to rejoin his old war buddy Curt Warren (House Peters Jr.) in the town of Sundown. At first Dan is mistaken for a railroad agent by Beau Santee (Frank Wilcox), a Sundown businessman who wants to keep the railroad away from his town. Then he discovers that Curt works for Santee and is nearly killed by one of Santee's henchman. Santee considers Dan trouble, even after learning Dan's true identity, and plots to get rid of him. With the help of Curt's son Stony (Kim Charney), Dan tries to get Curt to take a stand on the right side of the law.

This oater has more adult themes mixed with certain conflicts.  It has betrayal, friendship with a cost, renewal and redemption as told through the pen of screenwriter George Waggner, who worked on low budget westerns for Universal.

If you're a George Montgomery fan, this is as good as it gets.
