5657229,4,B00BNADZT4,"The quality and value of the Extreme Rules (2013) standard-definition DVD is consistent with other recent WWE pay-per-view DVD releases.  The entire show is presented as the main title on the disk and there are chapter stops for each match.  The video (enhanced for 16 x 9 televisions) and audio quality are on par with other WWE event releases: It's nothing spectacular, but sufficient for replaying the event.

Bonus features include the pre-show match between The Miz and Cody Rhodes and parts of the post-show are presented.  As WWE makes the pre- and post-show an important and integrated part of the main show, I hope future releases have both, in their entirety, as special features.  The included bonus features are consistent with other pay-per-view DVD releases, but are not as extensive and comprehensive as those in the WrestleMania three-disc sets.

I would rate the pay-per-view as ""thumbs up"" or ""four out of five stars"".  My vote for best match was the tag-team bout between Team Hell-No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) and The Shield.",1371859200,,1043,4.994219653179191

5657231,3,B00BNADZT4,"Chris Jericho vs. Fandango - Before I get started, I have to point out the comment that Jerry Lawler said which I agree with in regards to Summer Ray, ""Look at that dress she's almost wearing.""  Jericho took control early as Fandango was sent to the floor various times with Jericho following up going aerial with a top rope dive to the outside before Fandango was able to take back control grounding Jericho with a side chinlock & springboard legdrop as both men traded momentum with both men countering each other's offense at one point along with both men going aerial with moves like the crossbody & legdrop.  The story of this match was Chris Jericho taking Fandango more seriously than he did before after his upset at WrestleMania which played out well as this was more competitive than their previous match.

United States Champion Kofi Kingston vs. Dean Ambrose - Reigns & Rollins didn't accompany Ambrose to ringside making this match truly one on one as Kofi started out with his typical face paced offense of some high flying moves mixed with various kicks while Dean implied more of a grounded & slower pace with moves such as an impactful clothesline & crossface chicken wing plus showing that he's scouted Kofi at one point backing away from the Trouble In Paradise before both men hit some big moves like the S.O.S., double arm suplex, springboard crossbody, a Trouble In Paradise that knocked Dean to the outside, and one hell of a face plant.  Solid match.

Strap Match: Sheamus vs. Mark Henry - This was held under the traditional strap match rules where you had to touch all four corners without interruption to win the match as Sheamus showcased how to use the strap to his advantage right away by having the strap whip Henry in the face & take him off his feet without Sheamus even touching him while Henry tried hog-tying Sheamus to isolate him when going for the corners before both men tried different strategies to touch the corners such as Henry carrying Sheamus while Sheamus tried touching the corners on the apron as both men used the strap as a weapon to whip each other at various points in the match.  This match was just average as I'll give it credit in that it didn't use the same finish that we've seen in a majority of matches under these rules but their series back in 2011 was more hard hitting & physical than this match here.

""I Quit"" Match: Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger - Originally scheduled to be a triple threat ladder match because a #1 contenders match due to World Champion Dolph Ziggler's concussion as Del Rio started this match off taking it to the outside doing an unusual suicide dive to the outside onto Swagger before he was able to recover hitting a suplex on the floor & choking Del Rio using the barricade & kendo stick but Del Rio came back using the ringside steps to damage Swagger's shoulder & hand.  Both men used whatever they could to inflict more punishment such as the microphone or tying the other in the ring ropes to cane them to the point where Swagger was bleeding from the arm as a result but kept dishing out heavy punishment such as Swagger's powerbombs & the submissions of the cross armbreaker & anklelock.  I really liked the action throughout the match with both men giving & taking some really hard shots across the body with the kendo stick while telling the story of working over body parts with the only thing that may have hurt this match was the ""instant replay"" finish depending on your point of view.

Tornado Tag Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No vs. The Shield - Tornado Tag rules are simply that everyone in the match is legally allowed in the ring at the same time & The Shield was represented by Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns as Dean Ambrose already wrestled earlier in the night.  Bryan & Kane came out strong with Kane hitting a running DDT & Bryan holding Rollins in a surfboard setup for Kane to score a low dropkick but The Shield stuck to what kept working for them in the past using their numbers game by double teaming one individual at a time by beating them down in the corner but offensive moves such as a double suplex before Hell No kept using their teamwork such as back to back top move maneuvers & Kane taking both men over the top rope so Bryan can deliver his suicide dive.  This was another solid match.

Extreme Rules Match: Randy Orton vs. Big Show - Randy Orton's returns to his hometown of St. Louis & attempted to go extreme right away using weapons like kendo sticks on the outside only for Show to easily turn it against Orton & destroy it in the process before repeatedly chopping Orton & working over his shoulder but Orton went after Show's legs to take away the size advantage only for Show to be able to catch Orton on the top rope sending him to the floor followed by setting up a ladder scaffold across two chairs to setup for a Vader Bomb only for Orton to later use a chair himself in various ways in an attempt to keep Show down including resorting to something that we haven't seen from him in a long time.

Last Man Standing Match: WWE Champion John Cena vs. Ryback - Cena came into the match with his ankle taped as Ryback was easily taking him down with shoulder blocks & kept catching Cena whenever he was trying to amount offense such as a bodyslam when he came off the top rope or a powerbomb with Cena being able to keep getting up using his good leg & catching a break using Ryback's momentum against him but Ryback just kept remaining one step ahead of Cena punishing him including going through a table.  Cena was able to about to start mounting offense giving receipts to Ryback with some moves done to him earlier while also trying moves to knock him out like his STF & sleeper hold before both men took this fight to the outside collapsing the timekeepers area then going through the crowd & production area making their way to the stage using tables & fire extinguishers in the process.  The only real negative about this match is the controversial ending but it was the type of match that favored both men as we know Cena's at his best in these type of environments while Ryback is in a similar category as far as ability goes & told the story of Cena taking a beating but not have it be his ""stereotypical"" performance of getting beat down only to make the quick comeback.

Steel Cage Match: Triple H vs. Brock Lesnar - This was the debut of a new steel cage that's more of a smaller version of Hell In A Cell with the reinforced walls (similar to the type of steel cage TNA/Impact Wrestling has been using since they stopped using the six sided ring).  Triple H started this off with a bang attacking Brock as he was making his way to the ring & even giving Heyman a shot for his troubles before going into the cage & sending Brock head first into the cage more than once before Brock was able to use his power to shift momentum his direction easily tossing & ramming Triple H into the cage multiple times but injured his knee when it rammed into the cage to the point where he was screaming in pain with Triple H being able to escape the Kimora Lock by attacking the leg with Triple H continuing to beat on it.  Paul Heyman made his presence known in Brock's favor allowing Brock to execute the F5 on one leg while Triple H was able to use a chair to damage Brock's leg along with moves like various leg submissions to the point where Brock was close to escaping at one point where Triple H attacking the leg to stopped him before Triple H was able to pull out his favorite weapon with bad intentions.  I felt out of their series of three matches, this was the best one they've had with them telling the story of Brock being the beast he's always been but also the most vulnerable we've seen him in the previous year since his return.

Overall this was a good show as Extreme Rules usually is every year but not as strong as the previous years as I would give it a 3.5 stars but since we can't do half stars, I won't bump it up but I would check this out.",1370304000,3,8015,4.416666666666667
5657232,4,B00BNADZT4,"WWE Extreme Rules was held from the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri on May 19th, 2013. Here's a run-down of the matches without match outcome spoilers:
1. Chris Jericho vs. Fandango: A match better than their WrestleMania effort.
2. Dean Ambrose vs. Kofi Kingston for the United States Championship: A stellar outing proves people need to believe in The Shield.
3. Sheamus vs. Mark Henry in a Strap Match: Short and sweet match that was BRUTAL!
4. Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger in a 'I Quit' Match: The match was okay until the instant replay rule was involved.
5. Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns (The Shield) vs. Daniel Bryan & Kane (Team Hell No) for the WWE Tag Team Championships: See above at Kingston/Ambrose.
6. Randy Orton vs. Big Show in a 'Extreme Rules Match': This match had some hard hits, but a once-prevalent move makes a one-off return!
7. John Cena vs. Ryback in a Last Man Standing Match: I was fine with it until it ended in a No Contest, which is stupid because the only way to legitimately end these matches are for the ref to count to 10, no matter whose shoulders are down.
8. Brock Lesnar vs. Triple H in a Steel Cage: It may not have had blood, but it was a brutal war that made Lesnar look like a beast possessed.

5657234,4,B00BNADZT4,"The Chris Jericho-Fandango match was very good with a great ending to boot. The United States title match was Kofi Kingston & Dean Ambrose was not great but pretty nice. The Strap match between Mark Henry & Sheamus was a basic David-and-Goliath battle with some surprises to boot but still good. The I Quit match between Alberto Del Rio & Jack Swagger was ok but nothing really that great or even good.  The Texas Tornado match for the tag team titles between Team Hell No(Kane & Daniel Bryan) against The Shield(Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns) was a very good fast-paced bout. The Extreme Rules match between The Big Show & Randy Orton was a awesome smash-mouth brawl even with a generic Orton ending. The Last Man Standing match for the WWE title between John Cena & Ryback was a ruthless,violent ECW-ish battle even with the no-contest ending. The Steel Cage match between Triple H & Brock Lesnar was a solid,personal & brutal brawl. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1369008000,6,964,4.604651162790698

EXTREME RULES 2013

1. CHRIS JERICHO VS FANDANGO-this was the rematch after Y2J surprisingly lost to Fandango at Wrestlemania. I actually think this is a better match as it is a little more back and forth. Fandango actually looked like he might do it again here in this match. But Jericho was not to be defeated again as he took it to the rookie with a little more seriousness here. He hits a code breaker to get his win back and prove that it may have been a fluke that he lost before.

2.[US TITLE]KOFI KINGSTON VS DEAN AMBROSE-this was one of the matches I was looking forward to the most. I have been a fan of Ambrose since before he was in the WWE so naturally I am a huge Shield fan. This match was fun as Kofi used his speed and aerial ability to his advantage as Dean tried to ground him. They both look good here with some near falls and good action back and forth. In the end my boy Dean takes the title.

3.[STRAP MATCH]SHEAMUS VS MARK HENRY-this match was your classic four corners match with the typical spots that happen in these matches. Still it was not a bad match but it was not the best on the card either. Henry of course used his power in this match while Sheamus just fought back. In the end Sheamus gets the win in a pretty good match.

4.[I QUIT]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS JACK SWAGGER-this was supposed to be for the World title but Ziggler had to pull out so it became a number one contenders match. They go back and forth trading submission attempts trying to get the other to quit. At one point Swagger seems like he has won in all the confusion but the match is restarted. After that it doesnt take long for Del Rio to pick up the win.

5.[TAG TITLES TORNADO MATCH]TEAM HELL NO VS SETH ROLLINS & ROMAN REIGNS-one of the other matches I was really looking forward to as I love all four guys here. This was another fun match with all four guys getting in spots and near falls that get broke up. This is tag team wrestling and I wish that it would be taken more seriously. That match is great and back and forth with The Shield taking the titles after a great double team move.

6.[EXTREME RULES]BIG SHOW VS RANDY ORTON-these types of matches are always fun and this is no exception. They use weapons of course with a few being used creatively. This is a faster paced match then they normally do. Orton of course was the favorite to win this and brings back his punt to get the win. This was a good match over all.

7.[WWE TITLE LAST MAN STANDING MATCH]JOHN CENA VS RYBACK-now this was a great match right here that went all over the place. Ryback of course looked strong here taking it to Cena like he was going to kill him. Cena would fight back even landing a powerbomb on Ryback. Once they started using tables and all kinds of things for weapons the action picked up even more and kept that pace. Once up top we all know what happened that caused this to be a no contest. That of course was Ryback running Cena and himself through the entrance setup.

8.[STEEL CAGE MATCH]BROCK LESNAR VS TRIPLE H-and finally along with The Shields matches the match I was most looking forward to. Lesnar brings that big fight feel with him every time he wrestles as does Triple H when he gets in that zone. Triple H attacks Lesnar before they make it into the cage and controls from there sending Brock all over the cage. Lesnar of course is a beast a fires back until injuring his knee after missing a flying knee and hitting the cage. From there Triple H controls for most of the match it seemed attacking that injured leg. Still the Beast would prove to be too much once again for Hunter and F-5d his way to victory.

BONUS MATCH
1. THE MIZ VS CODY RHODES-this was a good opening match that you could see on any of the TV shows that WWE has. Good pace and action that leads to The Miz gaining the submission victory with the figure four.

We also get the post show with Wade Barrett, Titus ONeil, and Mick Foley and I actually like that they do these. This was a good event over all that had some really good and fun matches in it. I would recommend this to any wrestling fan out there.",1389139200,2,4100,4.258354755784062
