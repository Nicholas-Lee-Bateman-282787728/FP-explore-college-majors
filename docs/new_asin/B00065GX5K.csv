8039040,5,B00065GX5K,"I have to admit that I didn't know anything about ""Soar High, Isami"" when I bought it... but was very pleasantly surprised when I watched the DVD!  The story is primarily for kids, but as an adult I really liked it too.  The characters are great, the animation is wonderful, and the storyline is ADDICTIVE.  I gave this series FIVE stars, and recommend it 100%.  Thanks, Hirameki, for bringing this series over to North America!",1101859200,,428,4.666666666666667
8039041,5,B00065GX5K,"This volume contains 3 new episodes dubbed into English.  You can still hear the original Japanese music and it's great!  Episode 7 is called ""A Woman Spy of Black Goblin""; Episode 8 is ""Good dog, Genbel""; and Episode 9 is ""Forgetful Mr. Spider""

All 3 episodes are funny, silly, and extremely entertaining.  I recommend them to any parent who likes kids humor in the anime style:  watch it with your kids!",1101254400,,406,4.661971830985915
