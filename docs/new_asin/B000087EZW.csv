1827865,1,B000087EZW,"Grand Canyon Trail is the song Roy sings. Actually, the plot borrows heavily on Stan & Laurel's Way Out West. A hotel, a mine a mule... Even the sheriff might be James Finlayson himself! Film connoisseurs will also recognize in Roy and Jane Frazee's performance a hint of John Wayne and Ella Raines in Tall in the Saddle. It's too bad the video quality is so poor it looks like it's raining all the time. Although the box reads 67 minutes, the movie is really 57 minutes long, and you can tell when something is missing.",988675200,10,520,4.427083333333333

7979342,1,B000087EZW,"This was touted as restored, uncut version in color. Even the packaging says ""color""...twice. Don't believe it. What you'll get is a scratchy, blurry, black and white DVD-R version that looks like it was originally recorded on VHS from broadcast television. It may possibly be uncut. I couldn't bear to watch it long enough to see.",1496448000,2,331,4.928571428571429

Men ride into town to find the blacksmith shop closed down. Its owner invested in a silver mine. Mining engineers will dig deeper to find more ore. Cookie recommends others to buy into this mine. But the mining engineer says the mine is worthless and to keep this a secret! Mr. Vander Pool has spent all the investors money. A process server pursues Vander Pool! His secretary Carol decides to go to Sintown and investigate for herself. A rider stops a runaway coach and returns it. He picks up Miss Carol Vander Pool and her luggage, but she wants to drive. Carol meets Mike Regan the mining engineer who sends her to a hotel. Old Ed knows where the silver is but won't talk. Roy arrives and sings a song. He is told about the investment, but cautions the boys. There is humor about the food. Cookie Bullfinch visits Carol to ask for their money back. There is conflict instead.

Mike Regan questions Rogers, then offers him a job. Roy has a plan. Carol visits the mine. Regan offers a deal for Cookies stock, it is refused. An old gun is found, it belonged to Old Ed. They go searching for him, but the bad guys take him away. Regan wants the trespassers arrested. Roy and Cookie ride after them to the Sintown hotel. Is there a ghost? Genevieve the mule climbs the stairs of the hotel. Roy fights three men! The mule frightens Carol. Cookie finds Carol, then Old Ed. But Regan also finds Old Ed. Regan accuses Roy of murdering Old Ed! But Roy rides off, to be chased by Regan and his boys. Cookie finds a piece of silver ore, Regan says it is worthless. Carol takes it, she plans to visit the assay office in the next town. But there is a complication. Roy takes Carol for a ride. There is rain, they seek shelter in a cabin. Roy sings about a Grand Canyon Trail.

Regans boys continue their search for Carol and the ore. Regan finds them, there is a fight with Roy. Regan takes the ore and runs off. Carol tells Roy what she is doing, and Roy tells her of his plan. The newspaper tells of a new silver discovery. There is a song about becoming wealthy. The Sheriff arrives. Regan says Roy is a murderer and he will bring him in dead or alive! The Sheriff arrested the friends of Roy. There is shooting between Roy and Cookie against Regan and his boys. Will the Sheriff arrive to stop the shooting? Yes, and he arrests Roy for the murder of Old Ed. Then Cookie steps into a covered pit, the new silver mine is discovered! Will Genevieve the mule stop Regan? Roy fights, and Carol helps.

This is a classic Western about the search for wealth by swindling people out of their property. But it fails due to the efforts of one good guy and his friends. It includes comedy and music; some of these old Westerns also had dancing. The settings tells of its low budget, but it is still entertaining. It has a lesson in investments, but with a happy ending for the good guys. In the real world things may be different. The version in a 50 pack product is very contrasty.",1482105600,,2997,4.365591397849462

7979346,4,B000087EZW,"A little different than most Roy Rogers movies. It took pretty long for the heroine to figure out Roy Rogers was actually the good guy which was a little stupid, but still a fun movie to watch. I liked that Trigger had a co-star also!",1395446400,,234,4.222222222222222
7979347,4,B000087EZW,"These movies carry me back when I was a kid at the Saturday morning matinee rooting for the good guys. While watching these movies, I can smell the popcorn, drinks and candy. The Saturday morning matinee included comedies, cartoons, a weekly serial and two westerns and it only cost 10 cents. I'm 73 years young, but still a child at heart. The quality of these movies are very good and if you are a Roy Rogers fan, I suggest you add these to your collection. I'm glad I did.

7979349,3,B000087EZW,"Any movie with cowboys, horses, and action is a good one.  Most of the cowboy movies made in the 1930's, 40's, 50's were made in such a short time that the ratings have to be made on it just being a ""Cowboy"" movie.  I loved them all - brings back memories of going to the movie theater for a dime. Too bad that era is gone.",1362700800,,323,3.878787878787879
