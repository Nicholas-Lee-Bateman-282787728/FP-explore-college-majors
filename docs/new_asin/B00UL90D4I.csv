7051950,1,B00UL90D4I,"The acting was horrible and I couldn't tell if it was due to poor writing, poor acting, or both.  There appeared to be several plots but with no real connection.  I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't.",1435449600,,213,4.3
7051951,5,B00UL90D4I,Scott did well in this movie. He will be in many more movies of the action variety. The plot was not so good since they should have had the police arrest the shooter and not be obsessed with a lot of revenge. Fahey was not well suited in his father role.,1434844800,6,254,4.0

7051954,1,B00UL90D4I,Not even a B movie.  More like a C (if there is such a thing).  Horrible acting.,1434326400,,80,3.6470588235294117

7051969,4,B00UL90D4I,"I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival and loved it so I bought it.  Good film, great actors, good story line.  Definitely recommend it.",1452470400,,141,4.384615384615385
7051970,2,B00UL90D4I,"The movie takes place in Seaside, CA. The basic plot of the movie is that one brother seeks revenge for the murder of his brother.
Scott's character is from a low life family. His mom is played by Rita Wilson who commits inexcusable behavior; she smokes pot with her son. His dad in the film is an alcoholic. Scott's brother is a low life womanizer.

Rita Wilson does a good job in spite of a really bad script.

On the bright side there are some really good surf scenes, and of course Mr. Scott Eastwood is a joy to see.
I hope Mr. Eastwood learned a lot from making this movie and will make great movies in the future. Please start with a good script, and at the very least have some characters that the audience can admire.

I just saw a really good movie that puts this movie to shame go watch the movie, Brooklyn.",1448841600,4,818,4.230769230769231

7051972,3,B00UL90D4I,"Dawn Patrol wasn't very good.  I found it difficult to follow with things getting really muddled at times.  But if you've ever watched the soap, the Bold and the Beautiful, you'll see the actress, Kim Matula (Hope Logan) looking as beautiful as ever and in one scene in all her glory.  She's very good in this and for me makes the movie worth seeing.  Eastwood does a decent job with his role, I guess.  Yes, the acting overall may not be great, but when actors are only given so much to work with, then I guess not much can be expected.",1442275200,,537,4.2772277227722775
7051973,5,B00UL90D4I,Scott Eastwood was great in this movie. A group of friends watched it and we all loved it. I don't understand the negative reviews. Loved it!!!,1441670400,,143,4.538461538461538

7051975,3,B00UL90D4I,I'm debating whether or not I like Scott as an actor. I did like this movie even though the plot was cheesy.,1440460800,,108,3.9545454545454546

7051992,2,B00UL90D4I,"Very disappointed with the film. Music over powers a lot of the speech.
Only bought it to see David James Elliott they should have used him more in the film.

8707298,1,B00UL90D4I,I rented this movie because I have seen other movies with Scott Eastwood and liked them.  I was disappointed in this movie from the start.  It was not Scott Eastwood that was the problem.  The movie was filled with obscene language that ruined the movie for me.  I turned it off early in the movie and did not want to continue watching it.  I decided the next day to give it another try.  Once again it was disappointing.,1527897600,,421,4.333333333333333

8707307,5,B00UL90D4I,"Wait for it, the good, the bad and the ugly are shown in the hyper bright sun of southern Cali with all their foibles. I give the writers credit for not trying to make everyone likable but taking great risks by showing the underbelly of characters during the 2008 financial crash. Rita Wilson and husband played by Jeff Fehey let it rip in what intentionally is a raw social commentary about racism, xenophobia and the emotional wreck they lead their son, played finely by Scott Eastwood, to commit. Julie Carmen transcends as the dead boy's mother, in a quirky and original revenge scene that's worth waiting for. Kim Mattula holds nothing back in her troubled sex kitten lost child role.",1464912000,,689,4.75
