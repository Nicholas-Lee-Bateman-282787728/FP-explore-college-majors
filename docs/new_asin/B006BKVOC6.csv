8496149,1,B006BKVOC6,"Review of Hardware Wars Christmas Limited Edition
If I gave it any stars beyond the ONE for this set, it was for my sentimental love for the original HW and what it meant to me as a young film student, in 1978. For others, it would not mean as much. Young people of today are jaded and spoiled by today's digital effects, and do not realize nor truly appreciate the efforts filmmakers had to go through to create watchable, commercial films, using models and physically created and manipulated special effects.

FIVE STARS FOR HARDWARE WARS, THE ORIGINAL; BUT THE SET'S MISLEADING ADVERTISING FOR EXTRAS AND THE DISAPPOINTING QUALITY OF THESE, PLUS LACK OF A REAL COMMENTARY OR AT LEAST A DOCUMENTARY DRAGS DOWN THE VALUE TO A ONE.  MAKE ERNIE CREATE A BETTER VERSION, WITH A REAL DOCUMENTARY, OR PAY SOMEONE ELSE TO DO SO. (BTW, I ""get it"" that he is spoofing extras, etc., but he did a lousy job on spoofing and simply failed. It was less spoof and more of a rip-off. He really put no effort into it. He put quite a bit of effort into his original Hardware Wars, so that is the care that I expected to him to put into his ""extras"" which would not have cost him any more than this stupid garbage. Why cheat us on a genuine commentary track?)

SPOILERS FOLLOW:
****************

First off, I have #82 in this ""limited edition of 500,"" and although it might seem that these would be hard to obtain, I think I can see why Amazon keeps this listing up --because people are likely continually buying these, then reselling them because they are disappointed or through with them pretty quickly. It is sad and a disappointment to me, an original Hardware Wars fan, from its premiere year. Rather, I first saw it in 1978, I think. Or perhaps in Fall of 1977. I saw it before I saw the actual Star Wars film; I had not gotten around to it, until September 1978, for whatever reason. But in those days, I almost felt I had already seen Star Wars, because it was so ubiquitous, all over the TV shows, everywhere, showing film clips, the actors in TV shows, etc.

The ""director's commentary"" on this disc is stupid, annoying and an insult to fans. Instead of a real commentary, explaining how things were done and giving us real background, Ernie does a facile spoof of such commentary tracks, first ""arriving late"" to the set (which actually is something that Seth McFarland did in the commentary track to one of his Family Guy Star Wars spoofs, even there, Seth and his group at times jabbered about things that had little to do with the film we were watching), then doing a spoof of overly-high minded film analogies, which was sort of funny, but then I hoped he would settle in and do real commentary (like Seth McFarland and Co. did for their SW parody), but instead he spent the rest of the film yammering about silly things, pretending he could not recall anything about the movie since it was 25 years ago. It wore thin, and I wanted to turn off the DVD, but stayed.

The ""foreign language version"" is a spoof, with mostly what seems like a few real foreign words mixed in with joke words. It seems like a mix of French, German and Spanish, all together and I guess that is funny. But I got bored. If it was supposed to be a spoof, it could have been ratcheted-up, funny-wise by going more outrageous.

But the set needs something more. The problem is, it is not a ""movie night for a group"" sort of thing; it really needed a non-spoof documentary. Ernie is capable of speaking to film students about how to make a short film on a small budget (although the $8,000 he spent on Hardware Wars was still beyond my own budget at the time!). He could have done that, for posterity on this set. I was a film student at one of his lectures, back then.

I was in a college class on film in the San Francisco Bay area, and Ernie Fossalius was a guest speaker. We first saw the film, then Ernie either ran it again while describing the scenes and how they were filmed, or he ran a slide show on a slide projector (These were days prior to digital computers, so we watched it on a film projector, and it was too dangerous for the film to stop it at each frame on that). He gave us real commentary, telling us how he really created these effects and that --but even then, for some reason, he was obsessed about that steam iron, with its Bakelite handle, it's amount of holes and about it being a limited edition (just like he does in the ""commentary track"" on this disc), and even then, I was wondering why we should care about that aspect of the iron? If he was thrilled with it, that is nice, but did it matter to us, the viewers? He could easily have used a different steam iron and it would have made no difference at all in the look of the film, as any iron would have done as well. Yap, yap, yap about the iron, just like he did, in this commentary. You figure it out. A few more real things about the actual making of the film, in that the laser blasts were created by scratching the emulsion from the negative by using a pin (old fashioned, cheap method of special effect), that the stars in space are created by punching holes in a piece of black paper and shining a light through them; Princess Anne Droid's hair buns being real cinnamon buns (which ""disappeared every day at lunch time."" I have a hard time believing that. Would anyone really eat buns worn as a costume? They looked like they could have been made of plastic. If they were real, they would have broken. But would indeed have had to be replaced periodically). The silly ""merchandise"" he presented during the Creature Features segment was stuff he presented for his talk with us; I was dazed and confused while the other students laughed, getting it (because he stated that the film wasn't very good, but was made to justify the merchandise, which might have been the opinion of some people RE the real Star Wars, which was merchandise-heavy and which did promote the film months in advance of its opening-day in May 1977 with comic books, toys and other things, because George Lucas had control over merchandise). I would have liked more about the film, the actors and where they are now, and how this little film made over $1,000,000 and the thrill and adventure of being a small filmmaker who made good, but Foss does it this way. If he insisted upon this silly version of a commentary at least he could have added a small documentary with the info I wanted, but no.

Disc 2: The Christmas disc is simply a slide show type (you do not have to move the ""slides,"" he does that), with joke rhyming story. After seeing the disc one's wretched ""extras"" this cheered me up somewhat, but it is merely light humor, and short, and that is all that is on the disc. I was hoping he would do a spoof of the Star Wars Christmas Special, which was hilarious (and maybe an unintentional self-spoof), but sadly, no.

I feel disappointed in Ernie Fossalius, and wonder if he was a one hit wonder? When this premiered, I was young, residing in the Bay Area and George Lucas gave us newbies a feeling that we could make it too, in films. There was so much where I felt I could fit in; model making; puppet creatures that moved via one-stop animation, art work for matte backgrounds, like Ralph McQuarry did for Star Wars; special effects --- and this little film inspired me to believe that , too, could make a success with a small film.

I would liked more info on inside stuff --the lady on the beach, when Arte Deco and the C-3PO tin man___ are walking: this lady seems caught unaware, gathers up her towel, bag and stuff, and dashes off screen; the people in the bar scene --which bar is it, and what trivia about that? That song, ""I'm proud to be old Obie Wan Kenobi,"" to the tune of ""I'm Proud to be an Okie from Washkogie,"" --I always tried to find info about that, and never could find anything. Did it just exist for this film? Was it a spoof record? Do the actors have anything to say about this, are they still alive? How much did he have to pay Paul Frees to narrate?

Did Fossalius have a brother, because there was a tall guy with a mustache in our class. But maybe all 1970's-era tall guys with mustaches look alike to me. I found that guy irritating because his dumb ideas ruined our group film. I wanted it to be as good as HW, but it far and away was not! He had us doing a dumb short called: ""Can Man Fly?"" with a shot of his feet, jumping up, then of him stupidly sitting on a tree branch, resplendent in his stupid '70's-era mustache. The original idea was to run the film backwards to make it look like he was flying but I guess they decided that was too hard, so that was it. It stank, My idea was better. I would have used my soundtrack album from ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines,"" instead of the insipid ""original"" music from the friend of a girl playing dull chords on a piano. This was a student film, we didn't need to buy rights to the film soundtrack, dummy!

Just relating this story, because dumb garbage film was about the poor quality of the DVD I bought. It might as well as have been made by no-nothing, sub-grade film students with no talent. You ripped me off, Foss.",1404691200,4,9163,4.382941176470588
