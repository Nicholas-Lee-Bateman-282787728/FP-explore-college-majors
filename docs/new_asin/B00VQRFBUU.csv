8710932,5,B00VQRFBUU,"I liked Van Heflin in this 1942 black and white film more than I liked him in any other film. This was film-lite, but I enjoyed it. Van Heflin plays a criminologist who loves his assistant but doesn't realize it and she is exactly the same. The relationship between the two is humorous, a delight to see. Someone else tries to make the assistant his wife and she is torn. A mayor who is out to stem the tide of criminal activity is killed with a car bomb and after various tries, Van is able to discover the criminal.",1508198400,,517,4.232323232323233

This film is a dated, period movie, but still very entertaining by bringing forth the use of materials science to the arena of  crime detection.  I give it five stars for technical accuracy and for the candid look at government corruption - which has always been with society.",1477353600,2,317,4.625
