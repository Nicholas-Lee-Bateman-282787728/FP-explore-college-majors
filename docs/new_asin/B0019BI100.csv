8631292,3,B0019BI100,"I really enjoyed Somebody Help Me. Some parts were a little corney, but for the most part it was ok. As for April Fools Day this movie needs a lot of help.  The acting was not good at all, the story line was ok at first, but then got boring and stupid.  Not good acting at all.  I wish i could return this dvd back in.",1243296000,,318,3.787878787878788
