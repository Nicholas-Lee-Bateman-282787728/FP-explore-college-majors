2610830,4,B000GG4Y3C,"I am totally in love with the backyardigans. I bought this for my sons 2nd birthday, but now I'm hooked. I would recommend this to any parent who wants their child to learn while watching animation. To me the backyardigans teach children how to use their imagination and children today need that instead of video games or cartoons with violence.",1168473600,,345,4.766666666666667
2610831,5,B000GG4Y3C,"This is the newest DVD of Backyardigans. In fact, we saw them new on the DVD before they were even on Noggin or Nick Jr, though we have seen a few new ones not on this DVD since then (""Swamp Monster"", ""Volcano Sisters"", and one about snow, which I've already forgotten the name of.) I can tell you from watching those three new ones that Nick Jr. definitely offered the best of the new series out first on ""Mission to Mars.""

  My 6 year old son suddenly got ""into"" Space after watching ""Mission to Mars"", which we originally borrowed from the library in November. He absolutely loved ""Scared of You"" and ""Sumurai Pie"" as well. His favorite is Tyrone (while I love Pablo), and we laughed all through the shows at their facial expressions (his serious Master Pie-Maker face)or costumes, particularly Tyrone the Mummy King, with his funny hieroglyphic drawing in his moose-shaped Sphinx-style pyramid.  I grew up on Agatha Christie books and Sherlock Homes stories, so I was happy to see the spoof ""Whodunit?"" which really combines the two well. We were both laughing again at the Moose-antlered shadow of the mystery thief of Lady Tasha's jewels.

  Altogether my favorite collection of Backyardigans so far, as each of them are very funny, and as usual, the songs are always catchy, and I find them stuck in my head long after we finish watching the DVD.",1168473600,3,1354,4.711864406779661

And sing to the Backyardigans (we have both CDs in my car, I am actually worried that they might wear out from use, if that is possible!). This DVD has a great selection of episodes - currently my daughter loves to watch the ""Scared of You"" episode, most likely as it is the one we hadn't seen before.  These characters are cute and the stories are imaginative.  Even Grandma, Grandpa and the Aunts and Uncles have come to love them after watching them here!

We love all the DVDs (don't own them all, yet, but have most on TiVO...) and this is one of the best!",1168214400,,626,4.279661016949152

2610837,5,B000GG4Y3C,"Many, many thanks are extended to Nelvana and Nick Jr. for bringing back the Backyardigans for another season. This DVD has four episodes from the second season (which will reportedly have twenty episodes) and although the musical genres are rather obscure (at least I've never heard of some of them), the quality of entertainment exceeds the first season.

""Mission to Mars"" starts it off with Kenyan High Life music, one of the genres I've never heard of before, but which sounds like a cross between calypso and Latin music. Uniqua, Pablo and Austin are astronauts who head off to Mars to investigate a mysterious audio signal. Tyrone and Tasha remain behind to man mission control.

""Samurai Pie"" is my absolute favorite episode of the whole series so far.  Far East meets Western in this wonderful combination of spaghetti western music (a genre I HAVE heard of before), and kung fu / ninja action movies. The settings are very similar to those in the movie ""Spirited Away"", mixed with some ""Karate Kid"", ""Kung Fu"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  Tyrone makes the world's greatest samurai pies, and is teaching his apprentice Austin the tricks of the trade. Their task is to make the Great Pie for Empress Tasha, and get it to her royal table before the pie-stealing ninjas Uniqua and Pablo make off with it.

""Scared of You"" has Tasha as a mad scientist, with Austin as her henchman. Even though it's his birthday, she sends him out on a mission to deliver secret letters to three monsters, Tyrone the mummy, Uniqua the werewolf and Pablo the vampire. The letters are actually invitations to a surprise birthday ""Monster Party"" with lots of singing and dancing to a `50s small band theme.

""Whodunit?"" is an Agatha Christie-type mystery adventure, set in Mystery Manor, on the Misty Moors of Scotland, with detective Pablo trying to find Lady Tasha's stolen jewels. Is the thief neighbor Mr. Austin Frothingslosh, unexpected visitor Uniqua Underhood, or did Butler Tyrone do it?

Cute, but never annoying; imaginative, but still simple enough for young children to enjoy; informative without being preachy, lots of singing and dancing to new musical genres, plus now (ta-dah!!!!!) with Alicia Keyes on board as a singing mommy Martian - what more could you possibly ask for in children's entertainment?

2610838,5,B000GG4Y3C,"3...2...1...LIFT OFF! Launch into adventure with The Backyardigans as they explore outer space, master the art of making pie like samurai (pie-YA!), go on a mystery caper to find missing jewels, and visit a mad scientist's laboratory!

Mission to Mars features 4 different episodes, and is BY FAR the most engaging and fun Backyardigans DVD! My son watches his other Backyardigan DVD's intermittently, but he just got this one a few days ago and watches it over and over and over...

Here are the four episodes:

MISSION TO MARS: When the Backyardigans receive a strange signal originating from Mars, Uniqua, Pablo and Austin blast off to investigate. They're backed up by Tyrone and Tasha, who remain on Earth to assist at Mission Control. The Backyardigans leave prepared for anything, but encounter some surprises along the way. They don't give up, however, and eventually make a surprising discovery regarding the source of the signal.

This episode features two new characters: Mommy Martian (played by Alicia Keys) and Little Martian/Boinga (played by Shakyra Lipscomb).

SAMURAI PIE: Spaghetti Western music plays as Samurai Pie Maker Tyrone trains apprentice Austin to make the Great Pie for Empress Tasha...while fending off pie-stealing Ninjas Uniqua and Pablo!

SCARED OF YOU: Mad Scientist Tasha sends Austin to bring three monsters (Tyrone, Uniqua and Pablo) back to her laboratory. Tasha's Einsteinian hairdo is *hilarious*. Be on the lookout for special appearances by Mummy, Werewolf, and Vampire!

WHODUNIT?: Detective Pablo (looking much like Sherlock Holmes!) is on the case at Mystery Manor to discover who stole Tasha's jewels. Tyrone, Austin and Uniqua are all suspects! Featuring a mysterious English mansion, hedge maze, and theatrical ""acting"", this episode is my favorite!

Because the last two episodes are mystery-oriented, the Mission to Mars DVD would make an *excellent* Halloween experience for the little ones! As always, there are clever lyrics and diverse musical styles with the songs, so the episodes are not only entertaining, but musically educational.

This DVD also has some special features:

*""Hold Tight"" dance along with Pablo

*""A Message, A Message"" dance along with Uniqua

*The Backyardigans Game Trial on DVD-ROM (only a 1/2 hour's worth of gameplay)

An excellent--and very affordable--addition to the Backyardigans collection!",1160956800,22,2378,5.429347826086956

2610895,5,B000GG4Y3C,"My Daughter is 3 & normally watches Dora or Deigo. Great shows but I wanted somthing different for her.
She saw this show with a friend of her's & LOVED them. We had bought 1 dvd, & she watched when ever I'd let her. I bought Mission to Mars before Christmas in early December or the end of Novemeber for a Christmas present. However it came so late!! It arrived after Christmas!! Not that my duaghter really missed it, but it was frustrating because I had been expecting it for a LONG time.

Pros
The movie has 3 small movies/senerio's: Mission to Mars, The Grand Pie Adventure & The Jewel Mystery.
Lots of easy, fun songs to sing-a-long too.
Very Imaginative.
My Daughter LOVES these characters.
Encourages Imagination play.

Cons
The DVD has no cons. Very happy with my purchase.

The Shipping took about 20 - 30 day get my home. I'm very dissapointed with it. I normarlly don't have this issue with Amazon, but if i could rate my shipping experience on this product i'd have to say it was poor. I wasn't updated & never saw a tracking update on this product. Very Dissatisfied with how long this took. I should have went out & purchased it on my own @ a store here in town.",1357862400,,1177,4.389908256880734
2610896,5,B000GG4Y3C,My son loves this movie. This is one of the movies in his current dvd rotation.

2610900,5,B000GG4Y3C,"We own quite a few Backyardigan videos and watch them frequently on Netflix as well. However, this particular grouping is THE BEST of them all and we find ourselves returning to them again and again. The songs, as well as the musical styles, are simply top notch in this collection.

What you'll find are:

""Mission to Mars"" starts off with the catchy 'We're Going to Mars' anthem featuring all 5 of the characters (Pablo, Uniqua, Tyrone, Tasha and Austin). Later musical numbers give a nod to calypso-style beats. The gang are astronauts on a mission to determine who is sending a mysterious signal coming from Mars. Alica Keyes stars as Momma Martian.

""Samurai Pie"" is a favorite of my 7 y/o son. The musical stylings for this come from the spaghetti western. Pablo and Uniqua are ninjas after The Great Pie which is the demand-of-the-day from Queen Tasha (of course!). Austin, decked out in his own puffy hat, is the chef-in-training under Master Pie Maker, Tyrone. Background settings and fighting scenes are very 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.'

""Scared of You"" is my personal favorite and one we watch every Fall. It's Austin's birthday but the poor guy can't catch a break as mad scientist Tasha sends him out on a monster mission. Fear not, though, as birthday surprises are the TRUE mission of this episode! 50's Big Band-style music highlights this very enjoyable episode.

For you Agatha Christie lovers, there is the final episode titled, ""Whodunit?"". Set on the moors of England (or is it Scotland?), detective Pablo is out to find the culprit behind the theft of Lady Tasha's jewels at Mystery Mansion. You'll have to watch for yourself to see if the butler is behind this one.

Highly recommended family entertainment!",1306281600,,1735,4.90443686006826

2610910,1,B000GG4Y3C,"My kids love Mission to Mars just like they love the other Backyardigans they've seen (and I rather like the Backyardigans as well), but the ""game trial"" seems like an infuriating scheme to get kids crying and their parents spending two to three times the price of this DVD just to finish a game that their little ones get involved in.

The way it works is as follows.  The kid watches the episodes, which are very enjoyable, and then they want to play the game on the computer.  The parent installs the game and finds out that the game is only good for 30 minutes as a trial.  Fair enough, you think.  So you get involved in this cute kid-friendly arcade game that has 10 episodes (for lack of a better term) and you complete about eight of them and abruptly your time is up, and your kid is crying with this ""quit or buy"" screen staring them in the face.

Then, you click they ""buy"" button to see what tribute must be paid to Nickelodeon to get the kid happy again, and you find the game is $32.00!  (This is about what the latest Command and Conquer costs.) This so you can play a few more minutes and finish the game, and most importantly, get your kid to stop crying.

Well, I decided not to give into this scheme for extracting money from me, and instead I let my five year old cry, and then explained what had been done to him.  My slightly older son watched this all unfold as well. They both now say, ""We'll never obey them again!"".  So, this DVD was educational in a way I didn't quite imagine it would be.

2610922,5,B000GG4Y3C,"We love the Backyardigans (we have almost all the dvds) for great music, dancing, stories and characters. Easy on the eyes and ears even when seen more than a few times. My 1.5 year old will pick up her own toys to watch them. She wiggles and dances to the music (and mama sits down for a 20 minute cup of tea). The stories show some great imagination, which carries over into play even after the tv is off.

Our favorites on this dvd are Mission to Mars and Samurai Pie. After Samurai Pie, we gave our 1.5 year old a mixing bowl, pie tin, some measuring cups, a whisk and a spoon. She 'makes' pies regularly and loves to help making real cookies. Mission to Mars must have had some help from NASA.  While being a story written for small children, the scenery looks a lot like the footage from the real Mars rovers, and the 'astronauts' are generally saying and doing things that real astronauts might say and do -- and then there is a 'rover' that barks and likes to play fetch, and a really big underground slide and martian city, singing martians, etc. ...

As a final point, even in childrens' shows there is usually something that is too violent, scary, or inappropriate for a very small child. We have several Backyardigans dvds and I have never had to skip or mute anything. Very kiddo friendly.",1171843200,3,1302,4.416666666666667
2610923,5,B000GG4Y3C,"The creativity that has gone into the creation of the Backyardigans is spectacular. The songs never get old and are a lot of fun to sing with my 4 year old daughter, the cast talent is amazing, the stories never lack for originality. I have to leave the room when my daughter watches Dora the Explorer - annoying, no matter how ""educational"" the program is. With Backyardigans, I find if i walk through the room while its on, I'll sit down and watch it with her - over and over again.",1169683200,2,484,4.329670329670329
2610924,5,B000GG4Y3C,"This DVD includes Mission to Mars and it is just adorable.  The songs are very catchy and my two and a half year old really gets into them.  There is also Samurai Pie, Scared Of You and Whodunit?.  Mission to Mars is the best one but they are all enjoyable.  It also includes two bonus music videos.",1169164800,2,299,4.192982456140351
2610925,5,B000GG4Y3C,"What I love about the backyardigans is that the music isn't just good, it's great: interesting, challenging and funny. The story lines are great unlike some of the thomas the tank or bob the builder scenarios which are truly banal. My son loves these and we often find ourselves in our living room, playing that we are on our own personal mission to mars.",1168905600,9,355,4.5625
2610926,5,B000GG4Y3C,"OK, I'm bias here, I play saxophone on the recording sessions for this show and write the occasional underscore (mission to mars is mine). So I'm quite proud of it. But the thing is, these shows are really cool; they introduce kids to many genres of music (50!), dance moves and promote a healthy imagination. There isn't any pandering, it's not preachy and the stories are fun. My niece (2yrs) loves to copy the choreography and my son (3yrs) likes the stories. The backyardigans are nice kids and they are well defined and smart.",1168819200,6,531,4.659574468085107
2610927,4,B000GG4Y3C,"I expected it to be longer than the usual half hour episode, which it wasn't, and my kids had already seen the other episodes on the DVD several times. So, there was a little bit of a let down, but ultimately, Backyardigans is entertaining.",1168560000,4,240,4.4772727272727275
2610928,5,B000GG4Y3C,"We love the Backyardigans!  Mission to Mars was a huge hit with both my kids (5 & 3).  They get up and dance along with the songs.  And after I turn off the DVD, we have our own Backyardigan adventures together.",1168560000,,211,4.097560975609756

Now I unexpectedly had a new baby granddaughter, and first DVDs I ordered were this entire series.  My 14-yr-old granddaughter was excited to see I had these.  She said this one was always her favorite!  The one-year-old granddaughter is still a little too young to appreciate them.  She will grow to love them, though, just like me and the rest of my grandchildren!",1497225600,,502,4.767441860465116
