8265044,4,B00176I9R2,"This is a well-done documentary. It follows several of the children-students of the Beijing Opera around within the span of the day (dawn to night-time). Nice, interesting portraits of their lives and training at the Opera school. I showed this to my high-school students who are part of an arts high school and though lighter, part of a long-day-at-school music program.",1359072000,2,371,5.098360655737705
