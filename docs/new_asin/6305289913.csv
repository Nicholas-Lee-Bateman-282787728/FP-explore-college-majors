7887518,5,6305289913,"This film worked perfectly for my purpose, My High school art class is working on an ""Undersea"" art project and I allow this to run while the class works. It provides some background music and visual references for the project. I do not see this as a film to just sit and watch. For my purpose, it was perfect, the kids got some ideas and inspiration, I got the nice music in the background as we worked! :)",1444867200,,407,4.230769230769231
7887519,1,6305289913,This is a terrible DVD!  I didn't buy it to see pictures of divers. They seem to want to put each other in this video which is supposed to be about marine life. Save your money there are much better dvd's out there. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.,1405555200,,247,3.843137254901961
7887520,5,6305289913,"My son loves this DVD, it not only keeps him occupied when I am cooking or doing laundry, but he calms down and loves the underwater adventure.  A very nice deep sea DVD.",1243468800,2,170,4.151515151515151
7887521,4,6305289913,"I saw this video at a hotel in Reno.  It was so soothing and mesmerizing that I bought it.  Now, when I can't sleep, I play it. Works great.",1156204800,2,140,3.793103448275862
7887522,5,6305289913,How can anyone dislike this movie? It rules!!!! I especially like the fish jokes section wherein the Naso Lituratus (Of the Blonde variation for those a bit unfamiliar with Acanthuridae...) tells a rip roaring joke which appears inside of a sweet bubble and then...what takes place next can only be described as pure magic...the bubbles begin to retract and as they do you know it's coming...that's right...the most amazing sound of all-time. DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!! It's really impossible to represent with words...sort of like the voice of god. The Naso's voice is just too powerful for the human mind to comprehend.,1142812800,,623,5.303030303030303
7887523,3,6305289913,"I try to spend at least a few hours a week taking pictures of fish, and bought this DVD so my child - who's not yet swimming, let alone underwater - could see what sort of stuff is ""down there.""  The quality of the video and audio is definitely nothing extraordinary, but the subject matter is fine, the price was right, and I'd rather have my kid watching real live fish than cartoons.  Of course, I had to point out which species are, and aren't, found where we live.",1048896000,4,469,4.258426966292135
7887524,1,6305289913,"I expected excellent image and beautifully composed music, instead got a video tape quality image and music very badly composed.
The price does not compensate for such a low quality work. Instead I recommend spending more money buying another title.
The only reason to buy this title is to find out if your DVD actually works.",982022400,9,326,4.839285714285714
7887525,1,6305289913,"While the visuals are generally nice, the video/compression quality is very poor. In particular, the quality is very bad in the above water shots of whales and dolphins. I'm not sure how much it shows on smaller TV's, but  on a large screen it is very obvious. Also, I said the visuals were  generally nice but certain scenes are very 'hot' with poor contrast.
The  music didn't excite me much either. It's much better while listening to  your favorite composer. Be sure to note that it is 2 channel Dolby Digital  as opposed to 5:1. Why someone would encode stereo is beyond me.",952473600,6,579,4.58252427184466
