4686771,5,B005G0919K,"Whether you've read the book ""The Borrowers"" or are a fan of Studio Ghibli movies, you'll like this movie. Its one of those family animations that is intelligent, well directed, features great art, and excellent pacing - the whole family will love it. We were thrilled to find this so inexpensively on DVD. The soundtrack to this film is excellent, and is included in CD form with this set. There's an interesting story about Cecil Corbel, the accomplished lady who performed the entire soundtrack. Apparently she was a huge Ghibli fan and sent the Japanese studio a few of her CDs. They loved it and commissioned her to write the songs for this movie. Great stuff. Excellent DVD/CD set.

4686772,5,B005G0919K,"This is a great little film from Studio Ghibli. It is family-friendly, in the vein of ""Ponyo"", and it is very much one that I hope to enjoy with my kids someday. The plot isn't as grand as say ""Princess Mononoke"" or ""Spirited Away"", but Hiromasa Yonebayashi more than makes up for it with the artwork here. It is absolutely gorgeous. The voice acting is quite nice as well. Mirai Shida really does a fantastic job as Arrietty.

The product itself is really nice. The Hong Kong Blu-Ray edition is a legitimate release (not a bootleg) and it will play on American Blu-Ray players. It worked fine on my Vizio player that I got from Walmart, and I had no problems. The subtitles are very well-done and professional. This is a really nice edition, and it is about $40 cheaper than the Japanese which is a plus.",1318809600,6,805,4.476190476190476
4686773,5,B005G0919K,"As always, Studio Ghibli films are brilliant, creative, endearing and more.  Hayao Miyazaki is the most talented writer of modern history.  My accidental discovery of Ghibli films about ten years ago has led my children and I to become loyal fans.  The development of each character is taken seriously in every film.  This one is no different.  I didn't know about the books.  If I had, I would have bought them and read them to my children as they grew up.  Forget Disney and fairy tales that brainwash girls into thinking that if they are not as pretty and rich as a princess then they will feel worthless.  Forget that those stories make boys feel like they can never be good enough for any girl.  Miyazaki films don't focus on beauty.  They don't preach about ""good and evil"", as the classic American stories do.  In Miyazaki films, you see the grey areas that people struggle through in real life.  Environment is always a present aspect in most films.  The difficulty of balancing protection of the environment with that of modern ""progress.""  People aren't good or evil in these stories.  The characters are so much deeper than that.  The creative mind of Miyazaki is truly amazing.  The level of detail that goes into each character makes them all the more amazing.

Arrietty is the only daughter of a couple that call themselves (and their ""species"") Borrowers.  As always, there is unconditional love between the family.  There is always acceptance of individuality.  No one is ever made to feel ""less than"" like Cinderella.  Or Dumbo being made fun of his unusual and large ears.  Sure, in the end, the ""underdog"" triumphs over the various challenges, however, many main characters are first made to feel worthless and denigrated.  But Miyazaki, he bypasses the self-esteem crushing process that Disney seems to love.  Miyazaki shows that one can live in a supportive and loving family and still face challenges, having come out in the end with knowledge and strength.  Kids, myself included, have grown up being read fairy tales that, essentially, teach kids that it's normal to have your self worth torn to pieces in order to triumph over them.  Not true, I say!  Back to Arreitty.  Arrietty lives a fairly sheltered life under the house of ""Human Beans"" (No, it's not a sub typo) and as she is exploring her environment and learning, she is faced with her desire to allow a human boy to see her, to know that his suspicions of ""little people"" living in his home are, indeed, real.  Arrietty must be cautious, as their family must find a new home every time the Human Beans discover them.  The boy has is awaiting a heart transplant and also faces challenges as he discovers the secret world of The Borrowers.  The only antagonist in this film is that of an employee that, due to her ignorance, tries to capture The Borrowers for her own reasons.  Again, not evil, just not sympathetic to The Borrowers.  I won't say any more on the story.  But if you have never seen a Miyazaki film or even if you have, but have not seen this one yet, you must.

The music is so beautiful, as well.  I can, clearly, never say enough good things about any Miyazaki film.

If you are a parent of young children, I would suggest you throw away any Disney book or movie you have and get every Miyazaki book and film you can.  Raise your children with courage, intelligence and creativity.

On a side note, if your only exposure to Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli is Ponyo.....please don't hold that against them.  It was my least favorite.  It was so simplified for the American audience and the mass market, that it frustrated me.  I didn't hate it, it's still far beyond anything Disney will ever come up with.  My favorites are Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle and My Neighbor Totoro.

I look forward to the UK dubbed version of Arrietty, as Disney's focus is on making money.  Who knows if they will have the actors read in such a way as to change the tone of the characters completely.

Buy this film!  Adults and children will love it.",1316217600,55,4052,4.656779661016949

4686776,5,B005G0919K,"There's nothing in the world like a Studio Ghibli film, and Mary Norton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Borrowers/dp/0152047379/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Borrowers</a>&nbsp;(first published in 1952) is a story that seems tailor-made for the studio's magic touch. Granted, Hayao Miyazaki passed on his usual directing duties for this film, but contributed heavily to the script, making ""Arriety"" another strong installment in the Ghibli collection.

Studio Ghibli films come in two distinct flavours: dark and epic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/dp/B0001XAPZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nausica of the Valley of the Wind</a>) or light and gentle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ponyo/dp/B002ZTQVGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ponyo</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B002ZTQV8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiki-s-Delivery-Service/dp/B002ZTQVLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>). ""Arrietty"" definitely falls into the latter category, with a story that isn't afraid to unfold at a mild pace, taking its time as it establishes the mood, characters and setting, and which foregoes a complex plot for a very simple tale of transition and friendship.

Sho is a young boy brought to his great-aunt's house in the country to prepare for a heart operation, one that he isn't expected to survive. During his stay, he almost immediately becomes aware of others living in the house: tiny people who survive by ""borrowing"" bits and pieces from the inhabitants.

Arrietty is one such Borrower, a teenage girl about four inches tall who lives with her mother and father in the secret spaces under the floorboards and behind the walls. She's a delightful character, and it's very easy to see why Sho becomes completely enamored with her. In many ways she's a quintessential tomboy, one who scampers about the house, wields a tiny pin for a sword, and relishes any adventure that comes her way, but at the same time she's decidedly feminine - always garbed in a pretty skirt or dress, and scrupulously checking her hair every time she scoops it up out of her face with a tiny butterfly clip.

Far from the portly and fastidious Pod of Norton's book, Arrietty's father is portrayed as strong and manly, though her mother Homily remains truer to Norton's vision of a worrisome and rather excitable woman. At the beginning of the film, Pod has come to the decision to teach Arrietty the ways of borrowing since - as far as he knows - they are the only three Borrowers left in the world. Arrietty needs to become self-sufficient if she's to survive, though Sho's curiosity and the meddling of the housekeeper Haru puts the tiny family into grave danger. If there's one thing a Borrower must never do, it's be seen by a ""human bean""...

There are several departures from Mary Norton's book, and sadly many of the charming details of her series have been exorcised, specifically Arrietty's defense of how the Borrowers live their life (they don't steal, they simply borrow things that won't be missed) and their worldview (Arrietty of the book is astonished to hear of the Earth's population, having been raised to believe that humans exist solely to provide for Borrowers). Yet Studio Ghibli adds plenty of its own magic to compensate, reveling in the challenge it sets for itself: exploring how tiny people might navigate and negotiate a giant house.

The first time Arrietty sets foot in the kitchen, the film takes the time to convey its vastness to a girl her size: the echoes, the drops, the loud ticking of a clock, the immensity of space that lies between the bench, the floor and the tabletop. The attention to detail given to perspective and spatial relationships leads to some of the film's most innovative scenes, such as when Arrietty hitches a ride on Sho's shoulder. First we see the event from Sho's viewpoint, as he casually carries Arrietty across the room, only for the perspective to switch to Arrietty, who is travelling so fast that the hair is lifted from her shoulders.

Beautiful animation is a staple feature for any Studio Ghibli film, and here they take full advantage of the opportunities the setup provides for them, looking at the world from a high and low point-of-view. Perhaps my favourite detail is the way the Borrowers deal with water: whenever they pour themselves a drink, they only need a single large drop to sip from. Another fascinating touch is the way Arrietty reacts when Sho sees her for the first time: such is the Borrower taboo against being seen by anyone that her response is what you'd expect from a young girl who has just been seen without her clothes on - and later Sho is perceptive enough to ask permission before looking directly at her.

It takes real skill to fill an ordinary house with wonder and mystery and danger, but Studio Ghibli succeeds, making even the spaces behind the walls fascinating. There's also plenty of variety regarding the voice actors: not only the original Japanese cast, but also a British and American dub. I personally preferred the British cast (including Mark Strong, Saoirse Ronan and Geraldine McEwan) simply because the Borrowers is such a quintessentially English story, but each has its pros and cons. For example, the American dub makes it clear that Sho (or Shawn) survives his operation, whilst the English dub has a few jarring scenes - Sho talks in an oddly pleased tone to Arrietty about how the Borrowers must be an ""endangered species"" who are ""dying out."" Between that and the scene in which he uproots their kitchen in order to replace it with the one in the doll's house, you get the sense that he's actually trying to traumatize them!

As well as this, there is some Celtic music and songs that plays rather too loudly over quiet scenes, but for the most part, this is another winner from Studio Ghibli. It's always hard to know how a child will react to a film such as this, especially since children's films these days are hyperactive and more often than not reliant on a hefty dose of toilet humour. So there's no telling how an average five-to-ten year old will respond to the slow pace and non-eventful storyline here, especially sense the film foregoes the usual beginning/middle/end format of traditional Western films in order to tell a story that plays out more like a slice of life; a transitional phase that concludes on a very open-ended note (in fact, you may be surprised to see the end credits start rolling). You really get a sense that these characters existed long before the film started, and that they'll carry on with their lives after it ends - and we the audience are only allowed a small glimpse into their existence.

There is nothing in the world like a Studio Ghibli film, for they consistently capture the innocence and wonder that used to epitomize the Disney animated franchise (there's a reason Hayao Miyazaki is called ""the Walt Disney of Japan""). In this case ""Arrietty"" takes a very simple premise and creates magic with it, starring a heroine that manages to be as ordinary as she is extraordinary.",1372464000,,7651,5.5372112917023095

And as with most Studio Ghibli films, you're going to have a strong female lead!

This is another breathtakingly beautiful film with a very cute story. I believe this film is based off of a series of English novels about the ""Borrowers"". Each book deals with different families, including Arriety's, but the film in particular is mainly about Arriety and her family. The way in which the Borrowers live has been intricately designed and the film is abundant with sharp details.

The story's a cute one where I can find myself drawn into it, but it cuts short and leaves me wanting more. It's end, to me, was somewhat abrupt and it didn't give me much closure. Also, there's not much depth to the story as I was hoping it would. Don't expect too much, as I had regarding the significance of the story.",1349913600,,1149,4.572815533980583

4686790,5,B005G0919K,"The Movie:
Arrietty is a fine film, faithful to my memory of the book. Like the book, it will leave you wanting to know what happens next, but that's not a bad thing. I loved the little touches: Arrietty petting, then tossing and catching a pill bug; the physics of the shrunken world. At Arrietty's scale, raindrops and tea in teapots don't behave like they do for us. Never called out, Studio Ghibli gets the details right. I'd rank this as not quite as good as _Howl's_Moving_Castle and much, much better than Tales_of_EarthSea.(the other Studio Ghiblis based on English-language books). I think Arrietty is better than Pricess_Monoke.

I got what I paid for, a copy of Arrietty,  2010 GNDHDDTW, with the original Japanese soundtrack, a British English soundtrack, and English subtitles.

4686791,5,B005G0919K,"This movie appealed to both my seven-year-old daughter and I on several levels. We are both ardent fans of stories featuring little people and have watched the classic animated cartoon series from the 80s, The Littles: The Complete Unedited Series, as well as read the books by Mary Norton which inspired Arietty, i.e. The Complete Adventures of the Borrowers. We also love many of Studio Ghibli's productions such as My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Ponyo, among others. The hand-drawn animation with its lush colors, and great attention to details is another reason to watch this movie. The animators bring life to the miniature world of the borrowers, and watching the place Arietty and her parents call home is such a joy because of the minute details such as the decorations in Arietty's room; the wonderful, cozy kitchen; the paraphernalia carried around by Arietty and her father as they go exploring; and many more. I could gush on and on, but you get the idea - it is pure whimsy and delightful!

The story itself captures the imagination of young and old alike. 14-year-old Arietty Clock belongs to a race of tiny people called The Borrowers (they derive their name from the act of 'borrowing' what is needed from regular human beings or 'beans'). She lives with her quiet but strong and gentle father,Pod and a rather neurotic mother, Homily who is prone to panic attacks (her greatest fear is that her husband will not return home from a borrowing expedition after falling prey to a cat!). Life is pleasing and happy enough for the Clocks, but young Arietty dreams of adventure and of going on her first borrowing expedition. Her adventurous nature results in her being seen by a human boy one day. Shawn is a sickly young boy who has been sent to his aunt's house in the country to rest while he waits to undergo an operation that will hopefully help his heart function better. Sean has heard stories from his mother about the little people, and his sighting of Arietty leads to the beginning of a strange but wondrous friendship between the two, even though their worlds aren't exactly compatible, especially since it places the Borrowers' existence in jeopardy.

Like many stories, the plot would not be complete without a villain, played by batty housekeeper, Hara. For most of the film though, the focus is on the daily lives of the Clocks in their miniature world as well as their survival in the greater world, and also on the developing friendship between Arietty and Shawn. It is only in the last 35 minutes or so of the film that the action picks up pace, but everything just falls into place so beautifully, that my daughter and I were sad to see this beautiful animated film come to an end! What a wondrous film that lets one's imagination soar and warm one's heart! This film runs at about 94 minutes, and is rated G (there are some tense scenes when some Borrowers get into peril, but nothing that is overtly scary), and its original Japanese title is Kari-gurashi no Arietti.

other than that, the movie works! its looks pretty good to me, i don't notice any reduced quality from any other DVD animation i watch from my tv. The DVD has BOTH English and Japanese audio! the English voice is the UK version!!!

it frozes for a a few times for a few seconds, but then it continued playing. but overall, it works fine. I wouldnt reccomend this DVD, unless you HATE DISNEY CHANNEL AND DISNEY ruining Studio Ghiblis work as much as i do. Its like 16 bucks.

4686795,5,B005G0919K,"This breathtakingly lovely film from Studio Ghibli is a masterpiece. Based on the The Borrowers series of children's books by Mary Norton, it is the story of a family of tiny people who live in the behind and underneath places of an old house. They call themselves ""Borrowers"" and they pick up the dropped and discarded things that go missing -  a phenomenon familiar to householders - and put them to extremely clever, inventive uses. I loved the earrings used as grappling hooks, the stamps as artwork, and a round head pin that makes a very effective sword for the young heroine.
Arrietty and her parents, Pod and Homily, are the only Borrowers left in a house that used to be the home of many. Arrietty is just old enough to go on her first official Borrow - their sugar bowl is empty - and Homily requests a sheet of Kleenex too. For years the only human around has been a caretaker named Haru, but a boy has arrived, Sho, who is weakened by a heart condition that could kill him at any moment. His mother has sent him to the old family house for rest. Sho is weak, but observant, and he spies young Arrietty as she navigates the garden on a quest to bring home a bay laurel lead and some mint. Arrietty is terrified that having been seen will jeopardize her status as an active Borrower, but over time Sho proves a true friend. Haru, however, becomes suspicious and sets out to trap the minikins whose existence she has long suspected.  Pod and Homily must make the tough call: stay in danger or risk danger to find a new home where other Borrowers may be.
The charm of this movie is threefold: first, the tenderness between Sho and the adventuresome Arrietty: there is a love story here, the kind where love proves stronger than fear or difference, and strengthens the ones who love; second, the details of the lives of the Borrowers as they negotiate an outsize world, liberating cubes of sugar and trekking through dense jungles of grass and shrubbery; and third, the gorgeousness of the garden and other backgrounds, including a dollhouse that was lovingly crafted by Sho's grandfather and young mother for the little people they had once glimpsed. Any child - or adult - who has ever hunkered down to look closely at the world of roots and bugs and the close construction of things will love this movie. Both my 16 year old daughter and my 8 year old son were rapt.
A few hardcore adrenaline junkies who opine that Cars 2 was the ne plus ultra of film-making may be inured to the enchantment of The Secret World of Arrietty, but I'll nominate it for 2012's Animation Oscar over anything Pixar puts forth this year.",1330560000,,2625,4.5358649789029535

First of all, in other reviews, this product is described as coming in a 'shiny red sleeve' over the box itself, along with having an audio cd of the soundtrack. My copy had niether. The dvd is also described as japanese audio with english subtitles, as well as many other languages. It did not - and perhaps stranger was the fact that it DID have an english dub, but not the Disney dub from the theaters, rather a dub that features a set of British-sounding people. Even the vocals of the background music have this treatment. Moreover the menu is a single, static image with no chapter selection (even though there are chapters).
The cover's colors are strange and oddly saturated, and the on the back the synopsis of the movie is in english, yet the info about the disc is in japanese (and speaking of which, that description of the audio indicates a 2.0 and a 5.0 track, but both the japanese and wierd english audio are in 5.0)

4686799,4,B005G0919K,"WARNING: This review may contain some story spoilers.

When I first saw that Studio Ghibli had a new movie, I just had to get me a copy. I have been a huge fan of Studio Ghibli's work since Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso, with my favorite being Spirited Away.

The Secret World of Arrietty is based on a novel about a family of miniature people who call themselves the Borrowers. They live under the humans' home and survive by taking supplies (food, etc.) from the humans' home. Like many of Studio Ghibli's movies the main character is a female and her name is Arrietty. She is a very energetic and curious leading character who is still green in the process of borrowing. I must say that the animation in this movie is the best I have ever seen coming out of Studio Ghibli and I thoroughly enjoyed the borrowing sequence. Watching how the borrowers navigate around the humans' home was one of the best scenes in the movie. During her first borrowing excursion Arrietty was spotted by a human, a boy name Sho (supporting male character). Despite being taught her entire life that humans are dangerous and she should never be spotted by them, Arrietty can't help but be intrigued by them.

Arrietty tries to help her family by talking to Sho and asking him to not bother them but little did she know she was actually sparking more interest in her family by the humans. Sho tries to help them by giving them gifts such as food and kitchen supplies which gets the maid involved and her goal is to catch all of the borrowers. However, the character development here is a little weak because they never really tell you what the maid's motivation was to capture all of the borrowers. Maybe she is being blamed for the missing things or maybe she just felt like it was her duty to cleanse the house of rodents. They merely depicted the maid as the antagonist of the story (although she was also the comic relieve of the movie). The story builds up to Arrietty's mother being captured by the maid and her having to ask Sho for help in getting her mother back. As we approach the ending, Arrietty and her family ultimately decides to leave their home in search of a new home. The goodbye scene between Arrietty and Sho was very touching, made me feel like I was losing a very close friend. I was amazed at how well the story teller was able to get me to invest in Arrietty and Sho's relationship in such a short time period.

If I had to criticize the movie for anything it would have to be the story development. As the movie progress they open a lot of interesting arcs in the story such as; the maid's determination to capture all of the borrowers and Sho's heart condition and pending surgery, but they never really did anything with them. I never read the novel so I can't say how the book ended. But with that said, there was clearly a lot of potential in the story that would have made it a clear 5 star movie for me. I am relieved to see that despite Miyazaki's retirement from directing, Studio Ghibli still have some very talented directors working there. I am looking forward to the Disney treatment of the movie, curious to see if they will do the movie justice.

FINAL VERDICT: (Despite some questionable story directions, it was still a very enjoyable movie) 4.5/5 stars!",1329264000,3,3281,4.498322147651007

4686807,4,B005G0919K,"As a child, I used to spend hours outdoors, in the garden of our house or in the fields. And, in the lazy summer afternoons, during school vacation, I did daydream of many adventures where I was the great and fearless hero. A favorite one was imagining that I was small enough to walk under the blades of grass and the weeds around me, scramble over roots and climb up vines, and fight to the death with monstrous denizens of the underbrush: lizards, toads. Or fly through the air on the back of a bumble bee or a dragonfly.
These are common fancies of childhood: many have them. We grow up, and largely forget about them, unless our own children remind us, if they feel like sharing with us, grownups, their secret dreams.

""The Borrower Arrietty"" is about those same wide awake dreams: it is a children's movie (11 -14 years' old) for imaginative children, and it is a nostalgic evocation of childhood for those who were once so.
The animation, drawing and the colors are a joy to watch: technically and artistically, this is Studio Ghibli at its best. It is also rendered in their classic ""clear line"" style that is so good here it leaves CGI-heavy 3-D movies in the dust.
I have been lucky to see this movie before its theatrical release in the USA, in this excellent DVD copy. No English dubbing, but very good and unobtrusive white subtitles easy to read without being distracted from the action. Excellent sounding Japanese track, with music that underscores well the mood of the scenes.

This is a story of two worlds: those of a family of normal size people living in one big house, and of a family of tiny people living in the crawl space below. The small people live quietly, trying hard not to be noticed, because they have the hard-earned knowledge that, for them, being discovered is most dangerous. They ""borrow"" small items that make their lives easier or even possible: a sugar cube, that will last them months, a sharp pin, to use as a defensive weapon to fight with, or scare away predatory vermin, murderous cats, or attacking crows.
One night, young Arrietty, the pretty thumb-sized daughter of the small couple, goes out with her father in her very first ""borrowing"" expedition. That will lead to her being discovered by a normal size boy who is staying in the house ""upstairs"", and to the adventures that follow.
The whole sequence of the trip by father and daughter from their neat tiny house, disguised under bricks and rubble, to the boy's bedroom, where they are going to ""borrow"" some tissue paper, is outstandingly imaginative. As are, later on, several outdoor episodes.

The characters, both of normal size and tiny, are ordinary people trying to get on with their lives as best they can and know how. In some respects, the movie resembles the early Hayao Miyazaki's work in ""Totoro"" and ""Kiki"". There are moments of suspense or frantic action, punctuated with quiet, meditative ones, where the surface of things is lovingly portrayed while, somehow, the mysterious in them is hinted at. This is one of Ghibli's specialties: ""pillow"" scenes where the eye and the mind can rest on the first drops of rain marking dark circles on a stone, that gradually grow and overlap as the surface goes from dry to soaking wet. (Miyazaki wrote but did not direct this movie: that task was given to the youngest of Ghibli's animators, Hiromasa Yonebayashi.)

This movie differs in several important aspects from the original children's book by the late British author Mary Norton. That is not a criticism, because this is obviously a loose adaptation of the original written tale, one that takes into account the different nature of the cinema as an artistic medium, which is as it should be.
In fact, the main problem with this otherwise delightful movie, is that the script does not follow the original story loosely enough. That limits the movie to only a few characters. These are just ordinary folks, nice or otherwise, but not extremely interesting in themselves, the small people living in self-sufficient isolation, making hardly any contact with others. They are not sure if there are still others like them: they are, perhaps, the very last of their kind. And they live avoiding any contacts with their normal size, and only, neighbors as much as possible.
""Kiki"" is, in some respects, the closest previous Ghibli movie where the main characters are also ordinary people: Kiki was a witch, yes, but also just a girl trying to make a living with the one special skill she had: she could fly on a broom, so she set up a delivery service. However, she was a beginner in a large, colorful and exciting city, and her trade brought her in contact with a variety of unusual people in amusing or scary situations. In ""Arrietty"" there are only five principal characters, plus three or four others that show up occasionally and briefly. Also, leaving aside the unusual size of four of them, there are no magical beings, as in ""Totoro"" or ""Pom Poko"".

Perhaps because of the limitations of the story, the creators of this movie do not offer much by way of character development. Instead, they have chosen to give those of us who once daydreamed of adventures in the small world under the summer grass, a nostalgic occasion to revisit those dreams. And they have given our children the stuff of those old dreams to spin with it their own in their own secret world.",1327708800,3,5378,4.729211087420043
4686808,5,B005G0919K,"The movie itself is amazing. You'll find plenty of praise for it out there, and now that I've seen it, I have nothing but praise for this well-adapted film based off famous literature, but I thought I'd note my personal experience with this version of the DVD itself that non-Asian buyers might like to know.

The box art: I uploaded an image here of the version of box art I received, as it's different than what's advertised with the European text. It's beautiful and to me, is even more authentic. It's in glittery, red Japanese, like Arrietty's dress. Collectors with love it if this is the box they're receiving. It's a solid slipcover, and on the inside, just like a Japanese manga, the box is backwards. On the other hand, you can see it's littered with security stickers. Before I thought of uploading this image, I'd peeled off a giant white sticker that actually did a little pucker damage to the cover's finish on the left. You don't see it here. I didn't risk removing all the other stickers after that... Still, what a great design! But be warned: you might get a load of stickers covering up your lovely box art. The sticker I removed covered nearly the entire ""ARR"" of the original cover shown here.

First-time DVD play: This may simply be my DVD player, but what came on before anything was a non-subtitled ad of a man and a woman that I can only describe as a low-budget Chinese commercial geared towards couples... Suddenly, another seemingly random ad comes on, a movie reel of random events where there is no dialog but poor graphics. It's certainly nothing from Ghibli, as it's live-action. No subtitles again, and there's no way to change the settings or subtitle it to know what's going on. After a bit of this, the movie credits begin. There was no Main Menu screen presented to me. The movie just began on its own.

Subtitles: The subtitles are blocky and amateurish, but unlike Disney's or other companies' subtitles, where the text is too fast, tiny or just fades into the background, these subtitles really stand out, and you have plenty of time to read along. I was very relieved. The dubbing shocked me when it wasn't Japanese though. The movie just played on its own in this course dialect for me. Just get to a Main Menu if this happens to you. This DVD is dubbed and subtitled in three Asian languages, subtitled in English as well. The Japanese voice acting is fantastic and soft, and it's a great departure from what played for me, so make the switch.

Beyond those strange things, my experience wasn't ruined, more like added to. I watched this on a large HD TV, and the quality is amazing. It's not HD, but you don't really notice. Everything looks and sounds very crisp and lovely.

In short, this was a fantastic purchase for the price, and if Arrietty is released with an English dub, I might consider it, but I'd be more than very satisfied to call this my only Arrietty purchase.",1327536000,21,2922,4.590038314176245

4686813,5,B005G0919K,"Mary Norton's The Borrowers--the world in which a race of small folk live near or in houses with humans, taking only small things, like needles,thread, a lump of sugar--things that wouldn't be missed --enchanted me as a child.  Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have remained true to the Borrowers' culture, edited and kept most of the original plot, and set it in a Japanese home (in Koganei, western Tokyo) in the year 2010.  It's fun to spot uniquely Japanese items that grace the Borrowers' home--like the small plastic disposable fish shaped soy sauce holders--and the small clothes pin Arriety uses for her hair. Studio Ghibli unfolds the story and setting with subtlety and grace and although there are some newly created action scenes, there are none of the gratuitous action scenes that made the live action ""Borrowers"" movie such a trite farce. Studio Ghibli presents the characters more ambiguously than the original books as the studio's trademark is to portray characters who are neither ""good"" or ""bad.""  Miyazaki reminds us not to be too quick to judge Sho (the young boy with a serious illness), Arriety our heroine, even the house cat, or in the case of the backyard crow, that judgments are irrelevant. (Note: I suspect Miyazaki is a cat person--witness Jiji in Kiki's Delivery Service and the Baron in The Cat Returns.)

I also admire that in this movie Miyazaki presents yet another strong female lead who doesn't have to be an idealized princess to capture your imagination and heart.  Like Satsuki and Mei in Totoro, Kiki in Kiki's Delivery Service, Haru in the Cat Returns, Sheeta in Castle in the Sky, Sophie in Howl's Moving Castle and Chihiro in Spirited Away, Miyazaki's girls are not Supermodel thin or uncommonly beautiful. They are age appropriate and realistically human/imperfect. (Indeed Sophie is Miyazaki's version of Beauty and the Beast--with her being the beast.) They are smart and brave enough to figure out what is important and rise to meet their challenges.

I highly recommend this DVD edition -- in Japanese with English subtitles--because it has not yet been Disney-ized.  After seeing trailers for the Disney-ized version in the theaters, I can already discern differences in the characters and in the translations between the  soon to be released Disney-ized English version and the Japanese version.  I may Netflix the Disney-ized version after it comes out for comparison, but this version -- which I picked up in a video store in San Francisco's Japantown (the version 3 in Japanese, Mandarin and Cantonese with subtitles in English, Chinese and Malay) is perfect--Japanese audio and pre-Disney-zed English subtitles.

This Japanese animated version is probably its finest film version, created by Studio Ghibli. Studio founder Hayao Miyazaki helped with the adaptation, but, even though this was the directorial debut of animator Hiromasa Yonebayashi, it shows a sure hand and a deft sense of style. The world of four-inch-tall humans is at once believable and fantastic. This particular version features a British cast dubbing the script into English, and I think it's one of the main virtues of this disc.
