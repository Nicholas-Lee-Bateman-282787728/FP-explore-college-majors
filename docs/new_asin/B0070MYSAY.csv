8507796,5,B0070MYSAY,"I converted to B&B several years ago with the destruction of AMC. I tried others, but this one rose to the top. This DVD set is critical for anyone who hasn't been with them for a while or from the start like me. It is full length episodes as opposed to clips of the action. They do a good job of showing the ones that are important to the current story lines and especially relationships between characters. There is also good action. I like seeing Nick  (Jack Wagner of Melrose Place fame another of my faves).",1421020800,2,512,4.333333333333333
