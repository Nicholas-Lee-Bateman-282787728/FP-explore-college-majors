This is an inspiring, moving film, about the origins of a band that's gotten tighter and tighter as they criss-cross the globe.  They still do a great deal for the peeps back in Freetown as well.

If these All Stars ever come around, DO NOT miss the chance to see them live.",1189987200,,281,4.264150943396227
2849911,5,B000QXDD32,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone who's concerned about the situation in Africa today, anyone who believes that the situation there affects us all, anyone who believes that even in the horrors of war, there is hope, anyone who believes in the power of music to heal and help us all find our way.

The makers of this film have given voice to the amazing group of musicians who make up the Refugee All Stars.  In doing so, we're allowed a glimpse into their lives and the journey they've made through some truly inconceivable terrors. Through the unifying power of music, these musicians have taken the experiences of refugee camp life and drained every drop of fear and hate and oppression out of them and turned all that into a message of hope.  Hope for themselves, and hope for us all, if we care to join them in making a better world.

The DVD successfully walks the fine line between showing the evil and horrifying results of the tribal warfare that exists in so many places today and showing that the situation is not without hope and answers.  It's truly an inspiring film and, aside from enjoying the wonderful, wonderful music of the Refugee All Stars, a film that uses this music to give us all lessons to live by.",1189814400,,1227,4.53393665158371
2849912,5,B000QXDD32,"This is the remarkable story of Sierra Leonean refugees who start a musical group in their Guinean camp. The movie documents the band's return to their homeland. The Refugee All Stars eventually make a record and encourage their fellow refugees to return. From the outside, this film may appear to be a downer given the weight of the topic. Contrarily, this story demonstrates how hope and courage can help us to overcome hardship. Beyond the social and political elements, the music is fantastic. The group's musical style alternates between highlife inspired Afropop and reggae. For good measure, light brush strokes of dancehall and hip-hop are employed. While recorded in the new millennium, the music is graced with a 'roots' sensibility. Viewers who are wooed by the songs should acquire the accompanying CD. ""Living Like a Refugee"" plays refined songs that were only rough drafts in the film. Not unlike ""Buena Vista Social Club,"" this film documents an unknown musical group just prior to finding worldwide success. Indeed, this is now a global phenomenon, complete with live tours and film screenings all across the United States. The video production is excellent while the audio options include surround sound. The DVD is packed with bonus features including the trailer and the 'Refugee Rolling' featurette. ""Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars"" is an appealing watch on so many levels. It has music, humanity, drama, tragedy and triumph. Watch this film and experience the Refugee All Stars' phenomenon.",1189728000,4,1513,5.230452674897119
2849913,5,B000QXDD32,"The purpose of art is complex and varied, but it is especially rewarding when art reflects the strength of the human spirit.  When beauty, hope and positivity can be found in the face of abject horror, few achievements could be considered more admirable. The Refugee All Stars represents a conglomeration of musicians intent on finding a reason to believe in themselves against overwhelming odds, and this video documentary of their trials and tribulations is as spiritually stimulating as it is musically rewarding.
The civil war that erupted in Sierra Leone forced much of that country's population to flee into neighboring Guinea, where tented camps provided refuge but little else. This video follows the bandmembers' plight, from their horrific experience in their native country, to the time spent forming a band and rehearsing while in exile, through their trepidatious, but ultimately heroic return to the homeland. In the face of trauma, in the midst of a refugee camp filled with tents that can make simple dignity an effort of survival, the Refugee All Stars provide hope through beauty.
 From a musical perspective, the band betrays an unusually strong reggae influence, combined with rap overtones that fatten the grooves of the traditional African rhythm base. The vocal harmonies are rich, conveying evocative, melodic lyrics that rely on poetry more than political diatribe. Songs are topical, but not specifically political. Astoundingly, the band never lapses into polemics, keeping the emotional content of their plight front and center without taking sides in a civil war that has cost them so much. They bemoan the loss of family members - and body parts - to the most cruel brand of indiscriminate violence, but they aim over the heads of their tormentors, questioning human nature (the nature of violence itself) instead of the specific perpetrator. This isn't fiction, but the DVD plays like an adventure film. Eyes were slashed with a cutlass. Parents were killed. Children were tortured and murdered. Imagine the intelligence and strength of character that must be invested in the souls who can sing of such atrocities without exacting a sense of vengeance.
One fascinating characteristic of the refugee camps portrayed in this film is the unity of the camp population. The music made by the All Stars is celebrated by all generations simultaneously. There is a sense of community, togetherness and unity that results from the music of these remarkable players. As an American, I am almost ashamed to see how, in comparison, our own society is so stratified and distant, even with an abundance of creature comforts. Maybe it is because we have grown complacent while expecting too much from everyday life, or maybe it is because the stress of living on the brink of death causes you to be thankful for any small act of kindness. Whatever the reason, watching this video is bound to move you, but you will also swing your hips. The Refugee All Stars reach for the stars, and in the process they discover that music can quite literally be the language of God.  A  Tom Ryan",1189555200,,3096,5.052837573385519
2849914,5,B000QXDD32,"Zach and Banker have done an excellent job, in their first film-making outing, of presenting the dire conditions under which these refugees from Sierra Leone live and why they have found themselves in a refugee camp.  This might sound like yet another documentary of the bleak conditions in parts of Africa, but these directors have provided another view, one of the strength and perseverance of the African people, in this case, of a group of refugees who have used music to bring hope to themselves and those around them. Their stories of horror and loss at the hands of those who drove them from their homes is very poignant and is told in their own words.  This is very powerful.  The happy news is that this group went on to record their own CD and have the opportunity to rise above what has happened to them and return to their homes.  This is well worth seeing.",1189209600,,869,4.551282051282051

8198038,5,B000QXDD32,"The powerful music of Reuben, Grace, and the other musicians combines with their buoyant spirits in a memorable film. I had to fast-forward past a few short bits where they talk about the atrocities of war, but most people wouldn't have to, and now that I know what's on the film, I could watch it all again okay.

I spent the summer of 1963 in Moyamba, Sierra Leone on a work camp with a group called Crossroads Africa. We helped construct a school, danced with the people of Sierra Leone, and got to know many people as individuals. The music then was Highlife, and I was delighted to hear it as part of the mix with other traditions. Seeing Freetown again on the film was moving.

Most of all, for me this is a film about the amazing resilience of the human spirit.",1391126400,,768,4.363636363636363
8198039,5,B000QXDD32,Every person goes through trials and tribulations in life yet few of us can turn those dark times into something truly positive. This is a story of people who have lost more than I can fathom yet they decide to do what they can with what they have. The effect is beautiful music which undoubtedly helped many of their fellow people overcome their tragedies and also made the world more aware of their situation. It's a truly inspiring story and I recommend it very highly!,1287792000,2,472,4.564705882352941
8198040,5,B000QXDD32,"This is the real deal. To watch this band form in refugee camps, hear their stories; watch them play amazing songs - fantastic! The dvd starts with the band singing a Lucky Dube jam. Any root reggae fan will appreciate this Dvd. Real Real Real ~!",1280102400,2,246,4.369565217391305
8198041,5,B000QXDD32,I am rating this dvd as a 5 dispite the fact that I haven't even seen it. Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars performed today on the Dartmouth common. Their music is a joyful blend of instruments and musical styles and beats. They are simply amazing. I am searching for their cd now. Many thanks to the sponsors of this fine (and free to the public) concert. And kudos to these talented musicians for inspiring us to give peace a chance.,1245974400,2,434,4.4375
8198042,5,B000QXDD32,"This short documentary about a band of refugee musicians is more about civil strife and man's inhumanity to man than it is about music. While hearing accounts of murder and mutilation and seeing images of men and women without hands and arms, we learn of the decade-long civil war in the West African country (and former British colony) Sierra Leone, where hostilities finally ebbed in 2002. And we learn of the flight of refugees to camps in nearby Guinea, where they survive on humanitarian aid from UNHCR.

A group of musicians emerge from this nightmare to tell their story in song, eventually returning home to Freetown, where they meet up with other musicians, old friends who have somehow kept alive in poverty-stricken areas of the ruined city. As the film ends, they are cutting an album that they hope will help launch a career to support themselves. Aspirations take on excited new dimensions as they are invited to perform in the U.S. A follow-up featurette brings them to 2007, and we watch them on stage in an outdoor concert.

The DVD includes a number of their songs, laced with sorrow, anger, and humor. It's especially interesting to watch as their songs evolve over time and take on new energy and musical focus. Like other films about the healing and life-sustaining power of music (such as ""Favella Rising""), this one leaves a memorable imprint on the heart. It's a testament to both the tenacity and the fragility of the human spirit in the face of life-shattering trauma.",1207699200,,1494,4.83203125
8198043,5,B000QXDD32,"This is a compelling and ultimately uplifting documentary about refugees from the civil war in Sierra Leone who come together in a refugee camp in Guinea, create a band, and begin to transform their suffering into beautiful music. The documentary includes images of war torn Sierra Leone, as well as the stories of the members of The Refugee All Stars, so there are some very disturbing segments. If you are interested in learning more about this I also recommend a book by Ishmael Beah ""A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.""",1207440000,5,531,4.720430107526882
8198044,5,B000QXDD32,This film is a must see for anyone who needs a jolt of inspiration.  When all seems grim there truly is something more important; the simplicity of life found in understanding and forgiveness.  I can't recommend this film enough!,1190073600,,229,4.846153846153846
8198045,5,B000QXDD32,This movie is a beautiful film about people rising above a tragic situation.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and have recommended it to all of my friends.  Definitely worth viewing.,1190073600,2,174,4.9655172413793105
