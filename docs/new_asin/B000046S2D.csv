1338374,4,B000046S2D,"The Twilight Zone, Vol. 3 DVD is worth having if only for the episode ""Walking Distance,"" Serling's most autobiographical story from the series, by his own claim. Having watched many a rerun (I heard the Sci-Fi Channel owns the rights to air the episodes, but I never see them on the cable channel...) before the onset of DVD technology, it is quite a treat to see the episodes as the creators saw them: crisp, clear and as nuanced as any great film. I recall being joyfully entertained by almost every episode I ever saw, but ""Walking Distance,"" is the only one to have ever brought tears. The inablility to ""go home again,"" was never more poignantly crafted than in this episode, nor has the truth of those pure feelings of childhood which creep into our consciousness when we least expect it, possibly triggered from a bit of music or a long-forgotten smell.

Jack Klugman demonstrates his range as an actor in the episode, ""A Game of Pool,"" as does his costar Jonathan Winters. Both deliver steely performances with such well-regulated under-the-surface tension that you feel like each is enjoying himself and in agony at the same time, a feeling familiar to anyone engaged in high-stakes competition.

My one complaint about the DVD is that the features listed here are a tad misleading. There is no extra footage or documentary footage included as part of ""Inside the Twilight Zone."" Rather, it is on-screen text plaquards, with most of the information repeated among all 40+ DVD volumes in the series save the reference material for the episodes on the particular disc. These text screens also scroll by themselves and have no ""BACK"" control, so if you miss a word or a sentence, you have to go back to the main menu and start over, which is very annoying.
Buy this DVD for ""Walking Distance,"" and you will understand more about where Mr. Serling was coming from than if you were to talk to the man himself.",999129600,7,1914,4.727544910179641
1338375,5,B000046S2D,"A previous reviewer is quite right:  ""Walking Distance"" is beyond praise.  It is impossible to do justice to this episode in a review.  Easily one of the best, if not the best, episode ever made.  ""Kick the Can"", remade in the 1980's TZ movie, is also extremely well-done.  ""A Game of Pool"" is flawless.  ""Steel"", as the previous reviewer perceptively remarked, takes time to grow on you...I hated it the first time I saw it, and while it's not one of my favorite episodes, it's a solid and well-done piece of work.  If you're not collecting every last TZ DVD, don't miss Vol. 3.  It's easily one of the best.  E-mail me for any comments/questions about the TZ series, old and/or new.",988329600,2,684,4.540983606557377
1338376,5,B000046S2D,"When purchasing a DVD on any of the ""Twilight Zone"" episodes, I think it is safe to say that in the majority of cases the buyer knows those stories by heart. The main concern is one of quality. How does the picture measure up? In this case I have never seen better transfers. The images are excellent. They are sharp, clear and maintain consistent contrast. The laserdisc versions had a problem with black & white contrast. That problem has now been corrected.
Volume 3 contains A GAME OF POOL, KICK THE CAN, STEEL and WALKING DISTANCE. This volume is one of the best containing all solid episodes. WALKING DISTANCE is probably the best episode ever produced. Gig Young acts out Serling's prose so perfectly that he speaks for every man that ever wished he could go home again. Very moving. Bernard Herrmann's score intuitively picks up the emotion and heartfelt sincerity that Serling wrote into this story. This was Rod Serling's, Bernard Herrmann's and Gig Young's finest work for any medium. I think it is the finest piece of work ever put on film. KICK THE CAN is thematically similar and also very moving. Again one of the best. A GAME OF POOL and STEEL pits man against the legends he makes and the machines he builds. STEEL is an episode that doesn't instantly hit you. It has to grow on you and that may take years.
Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. ""The Twilight Zone"" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. However, ""The Twilight Zone"" still endures. WALKING DISTANCE will remain in the heart forever.",972000000,22,1861,4.782608695652174

Kick the Can"" is probably the most popular one of the four especially since it was one in (Twilight Zone-The Movie). But ""Steele"" is my personal favorite of this volume. Lee Marvin stars in this one and in true Twilight Zone fashion it's kind of creepy. Each episode is only about 20 minutes or so,it's kind of a teezer.",1284595200,,385,4.436619718309859
1338413,4,B000046S2D,"I'm so glad the Twilight Zone has been preserved on DVD, because as much as I loved the show, I did not see every episode when it was new, and I was too young to understand some of what I did see.  These four episodes include ""Walking Distance,"" which is from 1959, and addresses the often-quoted line, ""You Can't Go Home Again.""  ""A Game of Pool"" is Jack Klugman and Jonathan Winters in a most unusual game in 1961, with unexpected consequences.  ""Kick the Can"" is from 1962, and has an interesting twist on the concept of second childhood.  I did not see ""Steel"" in 1963, but I'm glad I did in 2009.  Lee Marvin plays a fighter after human fighters have been replaced by robots.

I think it's possible I will eventually collect the entire series of these DVDs, but even if I don't, this is one I will cherish.",1255737600,,811,4.337748344370861

1338416,5,B000046S2D,"Twilight Zone is one of the greatest tv shows that was ever made. Rod Serling wrote brilliant tv and even in the end when it seems his writings were not as good but also surrounded himself with alot of other talented writers. This set is an excellent sampler of what the show as about. Steel is the weakest effort on the set but it doesnt bring the rating down.

Steel- Human's boxing is banned in the not so distant future. A good film but it should have been replaced by a show that had the same themes of the other shows on the dvd.

A Game of Pool- Jack Klugman is an excellent actor and he does a brillant job as a pool player who wants to the the best. He challenges the greatest player who ever lived and he gets his wish. Johnathan Winters does a good job as Fats. With only two actors in the whole show and some great dialogue between the two actors-its a must watch. Klugman is also brilliant in In Praise of Pip and The Passage of the Trumpet.

Walking Distance- Perhaps the finest half hour of television you'll ever witness. Serling wrote a beautiful and touching story based on his youth. While recently viewing this, I noticed a few story errors but it doesnt take away from how powerful this show is. Martin's dad and Martin have some words of wisdom and then Serling's narration in the middle and the end of the show were some of the most touching words ever written for television.

Kick The Can- An old man believes he will be young again if they play the game Kick The Can and believe there young again. I like his roommate who thinks its all rubbish and the ending is good. Then again, all Twilight Zone epsiodes had great endings.

Excellent set with great acting and story telling thru out the set. Steel is out of place on this set and could have been replaced by a dozen or so stories that fit the mold.",1215820800,,1828,4.28695652173913
1338427,5,B000046S2D,"I own nearly all of the T.Z. discs. Today, I made a list of my most favorite episodes and my ""next-most-favorite"" episodes. It turned out that Volume 2, Volume 3, and Volume 9, came out ahead of all of the other volumes. Shown below are my narratives on my favorite episodes. VOLUME THREE has four winners, and these are: (1) Steel; (2) A Game of Pool; (3) Walking Distance; and (4) Kick the Can.  As stated below, Lee Marvin stars in STEEL.  This story provides the best lesson in all of the T.Z. episodes regarding perseverance in the face of adversity.  Also as stated below, if I was required to watch KICK THE CAN every week for the next ten years, I would not mind a bit.  Regarding WALKING DISTANCE, this is a fine story about nostalgia for childhood, though Kick the Can provides a better and more charming story about nostalgia for childhood.  A Game of Pool features Jack Klugman and Jonathan Winters at their finest.  The rapport between these two actors is as great as that found in the scene between Burgess Meredith and Robert Sterling in another T.Z. episode, Printer's Devil.  This is the scene where one man (newspaper owner) signs a contract with The Devil.  FIVE STARS to the wonderful Twilight Zone Vol. 3.

The commentary below provides my overview of the entire black and white T.Z. series. Immediately below is a list of T.Z. episodes that I've watched at least 25 times each. Without these particular episodes, I would not be me. For some of these stories, I provide a reason why the episode contributes to my personna. And below these, I provide the names of other T.Z. episodes that are charming and engaging enough to watch once every year or so.

NECESSARY FOR LIFE.
(1) Kick the Can. This story, along with Walking Distance and A Stop at Willoughby are the most nostalgic of the T.Z. episodes. If I was required to watch Kick the Can every week for the next ten years, that would be quit fine with me. I love Kick the Can.
(2) A Game of Pool. Stars Jonathan Winters.
(3) What's in the Box. This stars William Damarest, Joan Blondell, and Sterling Holloway. Damarest and Blondell are a married couple. They fight with each other just like my parents used to do in the 1950s and 1960s. What's in the Box lends a comedic frosting to my childhood memories.
(4) One for the Angels. This stars Ed Wynn. This T.Z. episode concerns a deal made with The Devil. This movie is soooo charming it almost makes me want to cry. This is one of the many T.Z. episodes that stars a child. THE BIG TALL WISH, which is about boxing, also stars a child actor.
(5) Nick of Time. Stars William Shatner as a superstitious young husband during a visit to a cafe in a small town. Don't miss the other great episode starring William Shatner, namely Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.
(6) Mind and the Matter. This stars Shelley Berman. This T.Z. episodes speaks my own opinion about noisy workplace arrangements, for example, noisy workplace arrangement involving cubicles. For this reason, watching Mind and the Matter over and over and over has become my religion.
(7) Steel. This stars Lee Marvin. More than any other T.Z. episode, this teaches the virtue of continuing and persevering, despite adversity.
(8) Thirty-Fathom Grave. This stars Mike Kellin as the mentally-deranged ""Chief Bell."" Perhaps the reason Iike THIRTY-FATHOM GRAVE so much, is that it concerns a submarine. Some of my favorite movies are submarine movies, e.g., RUN SILENT RUN DEEP, CRIMSON TIDE, 1941, and U-571. This T.Z. episode also stars Simon Oakland as ""Captain Beecham."" I was amazingly and stunningly and pleasantly surprised to learn, this year, that Simon Oakland starred in THE SAND PEBBLES starring Steve McQueen. Simon Oakland is also in the T.Z. episode, A World of Difference, where Simon Oakland plays a director (the man who cries, ""Cut!"") of a television program.
(9) A Stop at Willoughby. This stars James Daly as the overworked advertising executive. The story reminds me of part of my childhood. In this T.Z. episode, James Daly has repeated dreams during his trainride commute of returning to a simpler time, to living in a small rural town in New England. Perhaps that is why I love A Stop at Willoughby so much -- because I was raised in the outskirts of New Haven, Connecticut. At that time, I had some experience riding the same type of commuter train as featured in A Stop at Willoughby. The ironic ending in this T.Z. episode is among the very best of all the T.Z. episodes, and is equal in greatness to that of TO SERVE MAN, NIGHT CALL (old lady communicating to dead boyfriend), and TIME ENOUGH AT LAST.
(10) Printer's Devil. This stars Burgess Meredith, Robert Sterling, and Pat Crowley. The rapport between Mr. Meredith and Mr. Sterling in the scene in this movie that involves putting a signature on The Devil's contract, could be better than rapport between actors in any other movie in the history of cinema. This scene with the contract-signature really cooks.
(11) Person or Persons Unknown. This stars Richard Long in the character of ""David Gurney."" His last name comes from the fact that the character is being committed to a hospital. Get it? Get it?
(12) A Piano in the House. This stars Barry Morse as the cruel theater critic. And who cannot fall in love with Cyril Delavanti. What a delight is the Cyril Delavanti character in this T.Z. story. Cyril Delavanti also plays a delightful character in A Penny for your Thoughts.
(13) A Penny for your Thoughts. This stars Dick York. Dick York has charmed millions of Americans with his starring role in INHERIT THE WIND, starring Gene Kelly, Frederic March, and Spencer Tracy.
(14) Time Enough to Last. This T.Z. episode is so great that I quivver with humility at the thought that I might types few words about it. It stars Burgess Meredith as the incompetent bank clerk, who had the luck to marry a nagging wife. The nagging wife is played by Jacqueline deWit. Her character is strident in the same way as the wife of Gunther Toody, in CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU. The ironic ending is one of the greatest of all ironic endings in literary history.
(15) The Fever. This is about a man who initially harbors the notion that gambling is immoral, but who becomes converted to a gambling addict during a trip to a hotel that has gambling machines.
(16) Cavender is Coming. This stars Carol Burnett. This is one of the ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episodes. It seems that I love the T.Z. episodes that feature ""workplace situations"" the most. The ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episodes include, Stop at Willoughby, Mr. Bevis, Printer's Devil, and Mind and the Matter.
(17) A World of Difference. This is another ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episode. The plot involves a man doing his daytime job, when it suddenly turns out, he is only acting in a play.

CHARMING AND ENGAGING.
(1) Walking Distance. Concerns nostalgia for childhood. I have plenty of that, since my grandma was the best of the best of the best of the best of the best, and because I had lots of friends from the years 1955 to 1960.
(2) To Serve Man. Although To Serve Man is one of the greatest of the greatest of the T.Z. episodes, for some reason I only watch it every three years, and not more often.
(3) The Shelter. This stars Larry Gates who plays a doctor. The plot is about a false air-raid warning about an attack by Russian missiles. Larry Gates also performs in YOUNG SAVAGES. YOUNG SAVAGES is one of the greatest films in history. It stars Burt Lancaster, as well as Telly Savalas (Telly Savalas also starred in the T.Z. episode, Living Doll) and Edward Andrews (Edward Andrews stars in two T.Z. episodes).
(4) Third from the Sun. This stars Edward Andrews, who was so delightfully creepy in another T.Z. episode, You Drive.
(5) You Drive. Concerns a hit-and-run driver and the fact that he is haunted by his own automobile.
(6) Living Doll. This stars Telly Savalas. This is a great ""starter Twilight Zone"" episode that is suitable for introducing children of the age of eight or nine to the T.Z. series.
(7) Mr. Dingle the Strong. Stars Burgess Meredith. Not to be missed in this T.Z. episode is Don Rickles. Don Rickles also has a part in RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, one of the greatest of the greatest of movies.
(8-22) Okay, now I will just list the titles of the rest of my favorite T.Z. episodes. They are, Sixteen Millimeter Shrine, Prime Mover, Mr. Garrity and the Graves, Mighty Casey, Caesar and Me, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, Night of the Meek, Mr. Bevis, The Silence, The Dummy, Big Tall Wish, Night Call, A World of Difference, Judgement Night, Purple Testament, and Monsters are Due on Maple Street.

COLOR TWILIGHT ZONE. Many of the color Twilight Zone episodes are quite excellent. The best of these include, Execution of Grady Finch and Shades of Guilt. The color Outer Limits episode ""Time to Time"" concerns time travel back to Berkeley in the year 1969, and this story is one of my all-time-favorite stories.",1159660800,10,8942,4.688535031847134

Recently, as a result of modern tech., I have been fortunate enough to stroll back in time via the dvd series of TZ.  There seems to be a preference for the episode Walking Distance, understandably so.  The elegiac quality of the music, dialogue, and character depictions is more than evocactive; the episode does for the viewer what the twilight zone does for Martin: takes you right along with him.  How brilliant this show was/is in terms of telling a story. To hear Martin talking about the old proprietor of the soda fountain and then to have the door opened onto him napping strikes a resounding chord in us all who can remember a glimmering of those days. Vol. 3 also has Kick the Can, also pleasurable along the same lines as Walking Distance.  Game of Pool, good, particularly for us Jack Klugman fans.

""Kick the Can"" is the final episode and features a group of residents at a seniors' home. One of them goes on a quest to regain his youth.

Jack Klugman and Jonathan Winters deliver more tension and excitement than any current television drama.  Finally, ""Walking Distance"" is a brilliant look at trying to recapture youth and going home again.

I love this and every episode on it. I'm a kid who loves this series even though it isn't in color because if the writing is good, that will never matter. I love the Twilight Zone. Anyway, here's the review.

STEEL: While this episode is probably the weakest of the four as I don't believe the person in it enters the twilight zone very far (it's one of those where the Twilight Zone exists in a mental state) it doesn't mean it's not still a great story: In a world where only androids can box, a man takes his beaten up robot's place to win desperately needed money.

A GAME OF POOL: A man believes that he is the best pool player and get the chance to play the dead Fats Brown. The stakes: his life. I love this episode especially since it is the second one I ever watched and will always hold a special place in my heart.

WALKING DISTANCE: A man finds himself in the past when he was a kid and even sees himself as a kid. He realizes that you can never go back.

KICK THE CAN: A man in a home for the elderly finds out that children's games are the secret to eternal youth and shares his findings with the other people in the home. 5 out of 5 stars. Please do yourself a favor and get this (if it's a gift though, there are only four episodes and the volumes are cheap, so get one or two other volumes to make a great gift).

7919677,4,B000046S2D,"Volume 3 of the ""Twilight Zone"" collection features some of the best written episodes from the series. Include some of best actors around when TZ was on the air and you.have some outstanding programs to watch.

The first episode is ""Steel"" which is a futuristic look at the sport of boxing. Boxing would be an interesting subject to Rod Sterling. That would be because in his early years, including while he was in the army, Sterling was an amateur boxer with descent results. As a writer it would provide inspiration for some of his best work like ""Requiem For A Heavyweight"" for the silverscreen and ""Big Tall Wish"", another TZ episode about boxing. Produced in1963 ""Steel"" takes place in the future, 1974. Because of the brutality of the sport humans are banned from fighting. Instead robots are used in the ring to compete. Steel Kelly, played by Lee Marvin, is the manager of a broken down outdated robot looking to keep his robot running long enough to make it to the next match. Problem is according to his trainer slash mechanic their robot can't be fixed in time for the match. Sleel's only option to keep from having to forfeit the match is to pretend he is their fighter. You will have to watch the episode to see what happened.

The next episode is one of my all time favorites and has some of the best dialog ever to be written not just for ""Twilight Zone"" but television in general. The title is ""A Game Of  Pool"". Jesse, played by Jack Klugman and one of four episodes he would star in on TZ, is a man obsessed with the game of pool and the thought of what it would be like to play against the late  Fats Brown and beat him. There is an old saying, be careful what you wish for because you just might get it. Especially when it is the twilight zone. Fats is a legend in the world of pool and anyone beating him would become a legend themselves. But there is a price to pay for beating a legend and is Jesse ready to pay it? Fats is played by Jonathan Winters in a serious roll for the famous comedian. He gives a brilliant performance. All the action in the story doesn't take place on the pool table but in the talking between the two players. This episode is a pure joy to watch and is the best of the of the four stories on this DVD.

""Walking Distance"" is a story dealing kind of with time travel, a subject matter dealt with a few times on the series. Gig Young plays a business executive named Martin Sloan. He is a frazzled man who has become disillusioned with the business world. While driving one day Sloan develops car troubles and pull into a service station to get it repaired. While the car is being repaired Sloan notices a small town and decides to walk there. He soon realizes he is back in his home town where he grew up. Soon he sees his parents and then himself as a boy. I won't create a spoiler alert so just watch this charming little episode.

The last episode is a favorite of many TZ fans titled ""Kick the Can"". A resident at a rest home believes he found the secret to being young again. Just play the games you use to play as a child. It takes a little persuasion but before long he has just about everyone at the rest home sneaking out to play kick the can. Again no spoiler alerts. Just see for yourself what takes place next.

All together this volume is a must for the serious TZ fan but even the most casual fan will enjoy watching these classic stories. I highly recommend this DVD.",1387670400,,3431,4.326594090202177
