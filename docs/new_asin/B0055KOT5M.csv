Aside this, I have to confess that I really enjoyed all four volumes which were published as the picture quality (the source was directly from the Japanese masters) was spectacular as well as the Castellano (Spanish) dub which was newly produced specifically for it, though since its cancellation we've never gotten the rest of it.

All of the cast from the Castellano dub did an outstanding job with their voice acting as well as the script accuracy, but all of this was in vain considering they cancelled just as the series was starting to flesh out.

Luckily Discotek is going to release the films later this month of the Dr. Slump franchise, and if the sales prove to be a success then fingers crossed that they can subtitle the 80's series too.",1405123200,,867,4.690789473684211
