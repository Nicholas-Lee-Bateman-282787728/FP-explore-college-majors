8501193,5,B006MW4DTY,My son loves this DVD and our day DVD! He was immediately trying to repeat all of the words on the DVD. I've tried numerous DVDs for speech and my son has been going to a speech therapist for the past two months and this DVD has been the best. Very well thought out. I've recently ordered the flashcards and can't wait to start using them.,1328486400,3,339,4.151515151515151
