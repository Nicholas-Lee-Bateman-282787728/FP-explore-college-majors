8740616,5,B017TCH15S,"Hitchcock and Criterion, it's hard to go wrong this collection. Was able to get it at the great price of $72.19, it is a steal at that price.",1519948800,,141,4.071428571428571
8740617,5,B017TCH15S,"Hitch has and may as well be one of the greatest human directors in all aspects because he mastered the role with an inter level professionalism that most people don't invest 10,000 hrs in. Here in this collection you have a lot of brutal truths about the human experience. Especially with love and sex. But also some murder as well. Hitch know about fear and abandonment. The ruthless hypocrisy about doing  the right thing around the wrong people. The tragedy of emotional smothering and the false sense of security that almost all aspects of society have taking over. The polite sexual rage from an abusing ""loving"" mother or a madmen dealing with abortion without screaming about it. A character placed in an environment of hell and hypocrisy action over faith an the lies that get us to sleep at night.",1490140800,,807,4.764285714285714
8740618,5,B017TCH15S,"Great early Hitchcock films beautifully presented on blu ray.  These are some of Hitch's best works and to have Criterion do their usual excellent job at restoring them and putting them in blu ray format is a real treat - they never looked so good.  If you want these classic films in your collection, then this is a great set at great value.",1472774400,,342,4.412698412698413
8740619,5,B017TCH15S,"An exemplary set of three of Hitchcock's finest British thrillers and one of his first American features.

The set includes:

THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1934) - A crackerjack spy thriller featuring Peter Lorre in his first English-speaking role, The Man Who Knew Too Much is presented on Blu-ray with the following terrific supplements: an audio commentary by film historian Philip Kemp, an interview with Guillermo del Toro, an extensive interview with Hitchcock from 1972 (The Illustrated Hitchcock), audio excerpts from Franois Truffaut's legendary 1962 interviews with the Master of Suspense, and a restoration demonstration. The film's 1.33:1 transfer is beautiful, looking better than it ever has on any home video format.

THE 39 STEPS (1935) - One of Hitchcock's pulse-pounding wrong-man classics, Criterion's Blu-ray of The 39 Steps includes the following extras: an audio commentary by Hitch scholar Marian Keane, a documentary about Hitchcock's prewar career (Hitchcock: The Early Years), footage from a 1966 television interview with Hitchcock, the complete broadcast of the 1937 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation, a visual essay by Hitchcock scholar Leonard Leff, original production design drawings, and more audio excerpts from Truffaut's 1962 interviews with the legendary director. The film's terrific 1.34:1 transfer is a considerable upgrade from previous home-video releases.

THE LADY VANISHES (1938) - A fast-paced, comedic thriller that remains hugely entertaining today, The Lady Vanishes is supplemented by the following extras on Criterion's Blu-ray: an audio commentary by film historian Bruce Eder, a 1941 feature-length adventure film called Crook's Tour featuring Basil Redford and Naunton Way as their characters from The Lady Vanishes, a video essay about Hitchcock and The Lady Vanishes by Hitch scholar Leonard Leff, a gallery of behind-the-scenes photos and promo art, and more excerpts from Truffaut's interviews. The 1.34:1 transfer is stunning, to say the least.

FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (1940) - One of Hitchcock's first Hollywood films, a brilliant espionage thriller, Foreign Correspondent includes these extras: a piece on the film's visual effects with FX expert Craig Barron, an interview with writer Mark Harris called Hollywood Propaganda and World War II, an interview with Hitchcock from a 1972 episode of The Dick Cavett Show, a radio adaptation of the film from 1946 starring Joseph Cotten, the film's trailer, and a 1942 Life magazine ""photo-drama"" by Hitchcock called ""Have You Heard? The Story of Wartime Rumors."" Criterion's 1.37:1 transfer for the film on Blu-ray is about as close to perfect as it gets.

You don't need me to tell you how good these movies are. This is Hitchcock we're talking about and these are some of the most important and enduring works in his filmography. Criterion's presentation of these films on Blu-ray is pure class and probably the best we'll ever see of them on any home-video format.",1456185600,18,2964,5.446623093681917
