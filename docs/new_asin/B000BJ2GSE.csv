8087336,2,B000BJ2GSE,"The Mandarin Mystery, 1937 film

It begins in downtown New York city. There is news about the worlds most valuable stamp. A big ship arrives in the harbor. Two men arrive to escort Miss Temple, so too reporters. A young man arrives with a bouquet. He meets Miss Tempe by accident. The talk tells about the situation of this heiress. A man hides in Miss Temples room. She talks to Inspector Queens son on the telephone. Then that man takes something from her purse! Miss Temple discovers that item is missing and calls the hotel manager. Two detectives arrive. There is a dead man in the next room! The talk adds more humor. More police arrive to watch the rooms. Why was the victims coat put on backwards? Nobody heard a shot. Is that room soundproof?

Can Ellery Queen solve the murder? Miss Temple tells what happened. There is another suspect now. The men and women there will be searched by the police. But nothing was found. A picture is awry, what was behind it? They tell about the racket in counterfeit stamps. There is comic conflict and an overlooked clue. ]Note the two-button light switch.] A man hides in a dark room, then hits Ellery Queen. There is a die for counterfeiting stamps hidden in a chair. There is an arrest and more humor. Mr. Johnson is summoned to verify the authenticity of those stamps - they are counterfeit! Ellery suspects Bronson. Miss Kirk tells what she did. But there is a shot from the library! Miss Temple finds a pistol and gives it to Ellery.

Ellery gives advice to his detective father on solving the two murders. He explains why the jacket was put on backwards and the missing tangerine. Then how the door can be bolted from the inside! [You have to see this.] This doesnt make sense. People are gathered together in a room, the murderer is exposed and confesses. Can he get away? Not if there is an unexpected event.

I never read any of the Ellery Queen murder mysteries where a police detective father and his son solve murders. This echoes the Conan Doyle stories, but with more humor. This movie shows the popular culture of the 1930s. Is there too much humor for a murder mystery? Movies change novels to attract more customers. Humor is added to break any tension in the audience. Did you figure out the solution earlier? Is the expressions on the actors faces a clue? This is based on The Chinese Orange Mystery by Ellery Queen.",1430352000,,2381,4.569086651053865
8087337,4,B000BJ2GSE,I enjoyed watching this rare older version of Philipp Marlowe and clothes and scenary. The complicated story line is something that keeps you interested.,1344297600,,153,5.416666666666667
8087338,5,B000BJ2GSE,"There is a news announcement that soon Josephine Temple (Charlotte Henry) will be coming to this country to sell an extremely valuable stamp called the Mandarin (bet you thought it was an orange). At the dock Josephine shows off her stamp to anyone that asks to see it. The stamp is just loose in her purse and everyone knows it. Ellery (Eddie Quillan) accidentally introduces himself to her. She gets a counter offer from another collector but turns it down due to ethics. So a sneaky third party plans to pilfer the stamp. He ends up dead with his cote on backwards. Ellery points out the obvious; the stamp has a mandarin on it with his coat on backwards. Is this a clue?

As with most mysteries everyone had access to the body and no one could have retreated through a locked sound proof door. Will the most obvious suspect die before spilling the beans? Will Ellery get a date with the stamp owner or go to jail himself?

This is a fast paces story with only 52 minutes it has to pose the problem and hopefully the solution all while Ellery woos Josephine and out guesses his detective father Inspector Queen (Wade Boteler.) Can we keep up?",1338595200,,1145,4.5
8087339,5,B000BJ2GSE,"I loved this movie, I watched it about 20 times already, usually as I go to sleep at night, it is simply great and should not be missed by any detective or murder mystery fan. It is nearly as good as Karloff as James Wong, another of my favorites. Young Ellery falls for the murder suspect as the police try and sort out an impossible murder. fast paced, as mentioned before, but loaded, each scene utterly fantastic and captivating. I wish modern movies had this kind of depth of character, and great acting, quippy dialogue, etc. don't miss this one.",1266364800,,552,4.53
