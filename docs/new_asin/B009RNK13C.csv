5361352,4,B009RNK13C,I found this file very enjoyable.  I bought it because of Jean Harlow and Clark Gable specifically to see how they did in a very early movie.  Both were excellent.  I did not expect much from the movie when I bought it but was really surprised.  Anyone who is a fan of Jean Harlow or Clark Gable whould enjoy this movie.,1365206400,2,320,4.19672131147541
5361353,3,B009RNK13C,"Jean Harlow is my favorite old time movie star. Sadly she passed away when she was only 26 years old. Therefor she only made a few films. I have tried to collect them all.

5361356,4,B009RNK13C,"MGM during the pre-code era - {1930-1934} wasn't known for the Warner Brothers style of crime film but surprisingly it did make a number of  crime and gangster movie's - stylish crime melodrama's such as `Guilty Hands"" and ""Night Court""{1932} and the Ultimate Prison Melodrama ""The Big House""{1930}. MGM also made gangster/crime films ""Beast of the City"" {1932} and ""The Secret Six"" {1931} both depicting a U.S.A. in which criminal activity, political and judicial corruption of American institutions engulfed everything and showing how decent,ordinary Americans could be driven by these circumstances to self righteous suicidal madness.

""The Secret Six"" depicts the meteoric career of a nobody stockyard, meat house butcher ""Slaughterhouse Scorpio"" {Wallace Beery} tracing his murderous rise to become an all powerful gangster/crime boss that will control Central City {aka Cicero/Chicago} including the mayor's office, police, courts and newspapers/press. The brain behind Scorpio is ""Newton"" {Lewis Stone} a shrewd lawyer, full of contempt for Scorpio and his thugs but hungry for power and money and is the driving force to organize and expand Scorpio's bootlegging, extortion and prostitution rackets. Two newspaper men ""Hank"" {Johnnie Mack Brown} and ""Carl"" {Clark Gable} are bought off and play up Scorpio in their newspapers as a hero and ""great guy"" and the gang quickly consolidates its power over the rackets and politics.

Johnnie Mack Brown is the movies nominal ""hero"" leading man but Clark Gable {billed 7th in the credits} ""wipes the floor"" with Brown in every scene they're in together and this movie would be a major stepping stone for Gable in becoming MGM's top male star within a year. Jean Harlow {Ann} is in a supporting role as a moll of the gang who plays up to Hank and winds up falling for him. Ralph Bellamy {Johnnie Franks} 50 years before his role as Randolph Duke in ""Trading Places"" plays a greedy gangster who miscalculates on Scorpio's powers of observation and gets murdered for his error. Marjorie Rambeau [{an outstanding performance} plays ""Peach's"" a aging blowsey call girl who jumps to Scorpio from J. Franks without ""missing a beat"" and after being uncerimoniously dumped by Scorpio - she will eventually extract a well deserved {if improbable} revenge against him.

The Secret Six are a group of masked vigilantes in high government and law enforcement positions that {apparently} work outside of normal government and political channels due to rampart gangster violence and political corruption. Carl {Gable} is contacted and meets ""The Secret Six"" and agrees to become their informant to get evidence on Scorpio and his gang. Despite the movie being written by a top flight screen writer Francis Marion, her screenplay lacks coherence, logic and fails to show/persuade how and why ""The Secret Six"" all of a sudden appears on the scene and that this vigilante group can be considered ""The Greatest Force of Good"" in the U.S.A. - as depicted in the film !!

At the depth of the Great Depression in 1932 the government and law enforcement weren't very popular and ""gangsterism"" was ""chic"" in many circles. It is surprising and significant that MGM {in this film} would take such a bleak view in endorsing vigilantism by legitimate goverment officals, insitutions and the police as the last resort to fight and defeat organized crime.

Despite the flawed screenplay this film is engrossing with excellent production values, sharp dialogue, a tense courtroom scene and a slam bang climax. Lewis Stone gives the movies best performance - ""Newton"" is the brains, guts and heart of the Scorpio gang and his acid disdain for them is evident in his every phrase and gesture AND yet Scorpio and his gang know that he is their indispensible man.

This is an unusual movie that speaks volumes to the frustrations of the U.S.A. populace in 1932 - the ordinary decent men, women and famillies trying to survive tough times with rampant unemployment, organized crime, goverment corruption and the legal and social system all seemly being skewed against them - shades of the political frustrations being felt by many Americans in 2012 - 2013. Despite the less than satisfactory screenplay this is an unusual and very entertaining film if disturbing in it's theme and conclusions. I liked this film and give it a rating of between 4 and 4 1/2 stars.",1356825600,11,4377,5.113286713286714

8543912,3,B009RNK13C,"A rare foray into the genre from MGM, for much of its running time The Secret Six is shaping up to be a superior gangster movie until its let down by a weak third act and the Secret Six themselves. As in so many gangster movies of the era, they're a benevolent bunch of city patriarchs who have taken it upon themselves to rid their city of crime, but despite the film being named after them they're barely in the picture, which is no bad thing. When they finally do appear the best part of an hour into the 83-minute film, they're simply an anonymous bunch of men in suits wearing silly silk Lone Ranger masks at a police briefing who do absolutely nothing, while their only other appearance at the end of the film makes no real sense at all despite being the only part of the film when they have any impact on the plot whatsoever. Cashing in on the name of the real group of anonymous Chicago businessmen credited with bringing down Al Capone and other notorious mobsters, they're just a silly torn-from-the-headlines angle to sell a typical rise-and-fall gangster movie thats much more fun when its following Wallace Beerys progress from slaughterhouse worker to enforcer for a young, scar-faced and duplicitous Ralph Bellamys gang. Naturally its not long before hes taking over both the rackets and the city itself with help from Lewis Stones urbane crooked lawyer. He even gets one of his gang elected as mayor on an honesty ticket even though everyone knows they're gangsters.

Beerys having a ball basically just being himself as the thug with a dirty mug and Lewis Stone provides a memorable contrast in a nicely understated performance as the power behind the throne. First introduced vaguely waking from a few drinks too many but growing in laidback poise and confidence as he sees the newcomers possibilities, he gets to demonstrate his dark arts to keep him out of jail while cleaning house of the less useful gang members with barely an expression of interest: Judge Hardy he is not. On the sidelines are Clark Gable and Johnny Mack Browns reporters, fighting for cigarette girl Jean Harlows affections, who in turn is playing both of them along to ensure Beery gets a good press. Brown may get the higher billing, but Gable gets the better part, MGM beefing up his role during the shoot due to his undeniable charisma and growing confidence on the screen  when he tells Harlow Listen, if you're gonna fall for anybody, make it me youll wonder why shes wasting her time with his leadfooted rival. Playing brassy rather than classy (Sure, I get you. Youre no crossword puzzle.) Harlows still on a learning curve here, but shes at her best whenever the film pairs her with Gable so its no surprise they would became a regular screen pairing in five more films.

At times, particularly the early scenes, it feels like a Warner Bros movie with MGM production values (youd never see anything like Wallace Beerys art deco apartment over on the more cost-conscious Burbank lot), clearly inspired by the likes of Little Caesar and The Public Enemy while anticipating a lot of elements in the following years Scarface, not least Beerys obsession with bettering himself while remaining blissfully unaware of how relentlessly uncouth he is. It wears its Pre-Code morality fairly lightly (though Beery does complain about his moll talking in her sleep) but forgotten and ill-fated wunderkind George Hills direction certainly elevates much of the material, with some striking tracking shots, an effective scene where Beery and his entourage silently search his house for an interloper and the odd virtuoso touch like shooting a car crash from the drivers point of view. Theres certainly enough to enjoy for the rushed resolution and the Pathetic Six not to let down the picture too much.

Warner Archive's DVD-R offers a decent transfer but no extras.",1503878400,2,3851,4.83030303030303

8543916,4,B009RNK13C,"I have a hard time believing that Frances Marion - one of my favorite screenwriters of the silent and early talkie era - wrote this, it has so many holes. It's almost like someone locked Frances Marion in a closet, wrote this script, and forged her signature to it. Let me just say only one paragraph at the end of the review somewhat spoils the film. I try to leave out details in the rest of it.

First off, the film is like two different movies. At the beginning you see ""Slaughterhouse"" Scorpio, so-named because he is working in a slaughterhouse, take up with the gang of his pal Johnny Franks (Ralph Bellamy). Scorpio has an extra ""rod"", actually has it on him, and likes the idea of extra money for what seems like the relatively easy work of bootlegging and whatever violence comes with it. Upstairs to gang headquarters trudges the gang. Then all of the questions start to appear.

There is an older man, Robert Newton (Lewis Stone), in a somewhat drunken stupor, who seems to be in charge and is suspicious of the new gang member. Newton insults the gang freely for ""thinking"", but for some reason he is not afraid of them just shooting him and they just take these insults. Why?

Is Robert Newton head of the gang? Is Johnny Franks? Why are Johnny and Scorpio fighting over a run-down used-up looking woman who is obviously trading on rapidly diminishing if not completely depleted assets (Marjorie Rambeau as Peaches) when the beautiful Anne (Jean Harlow) is working downstairs? Why would Newton or any of the gang think that trespassing on a bigger gang's territory, headed by John Miljan as the tux-wearing piano-playing Colimo, lead to anything but violence and little or no profit - which it does? And that's just the first half of the film.

The second half of the movie, in almost one frame exactly, introduces for the first time three of MGM's biggest stars - Jean Harlow is Anne, who is a cashier at the restaurant that serves as a front for the gang, and Clark Gable and Johnny Mack Brown are two newspaper reporters, Hank and Carl, friends but trying to best each other for the biggest scoop. Anne is enlisted by Scorpio to sweet-talk Hank into not writing so much scathing material about him, and Carl seems to be on the take - but is he? Now more questions, raised not by a good plot, but by plot holes. If Newton has so little respect for Scorpio, why does he just accept him as the new gang leader? Why bother to use the courts to try Scorpio for murder and then, when that fails, that very night just use the Secret Six - who have been introduced some time before as some quasi-legal branch of law enforcement - to flood the gang with legal papers that deport practically the entire gang, disbar Newton, and indict Scorpio for tax fraud? Why the orderly arrest of Scorpio for murder but this no holds barred tommy-gun blasting surrounding and invasion of Scorpio's headquarters over all of these non-violent offenses?

Let me just say I can't even see the reason for putting the secret six in the same room. They never say anything to each other, and those skimpy masks they wear are not going to fool anybody who might know them as to who they are anymore than The Lone Ranger's mask would have fooled anybody who knew him.

And the second from the last scene is just goofy, and the only reason I have a spoiler warning on this review. There is Scorpio and his gang on death row, practically queued up, with ten minutes between the executions of all of them. Scorpio was arrested the second time around for tax fraud not murder...how did he wind up with the death penalty? Perhaps we can lay all of this nonsense at the feet of William Randolph Hearst, whose Cosmopolitan Production company backed the film and a film with a similar tone ""Gabriel Over the White House"". It seemed that when dealing with thugs Hearst didn't mind throwing the law books out the window and just lining everyone up and shooting them. Plus Hearst had so much money and power nobody was going to tell him - your film is goofy.

What's the last scene? Gable as reporter Carl, telling his editor he's going to sleep for a month, he's worked so hard...but, no, there's a big story brewing and he's out to cover it like the energetic trooper of a reporter he is. Huh??? How did this film start out being about gang warfare and end up being about a reporter not introduced until the film's midpoint? Inquiring minds want to know.

I'd watch this for some great acting and the great gangster film atmosphere. Then there is the irony. Plotwise there is the irony concerning how Scorpio is apprehended -I'll let you watch and find out what I'm talking about. Film history wise, there is the irony of seeing Gable and Brown as rivals on film, when in fact Gable's appearance at MGM was curtains for Johnny Mack Brown, because Gable's growly voice is what people expected Johnny Mack Brown to sound like, plus Gable just had such screen presence. I'd recommend it, but prepare to be confused.",1428796800,,4987,4.551839464882943

8543919,5,B009RNK13C,"This is the thinly-disguised story of events in Chicago as the Internal Revenue bureau was closing in on Al Capone. It was gotten onscreen thru legal hurdles by the Alamo Draft house in Austin in the late 1990s. Johnny Mack Brown plays a version of Jake Lingle, Chicago crime reporter gunned down the day before he was to meet with Treasury Agent Frank Wilson. Frances Marion, highest-paid screenwriter of the time, spent months in Chicago researching as Eliot Ness smashed Capone breweries with snow plows. This is also the only movie of record showing a real moonshine still--a huge assembly costing tens of thousands of gold dollars, surrounded by stacked bags of glucose corn sugar, source of 98% of all whiskey consumed in America at the time. Beery, Stone and Harlow were the thirties' equivalent of the Not Ready for Prime Time players on old SNL. Their movies showed how fanatical prohibitionism corrupted and destroyed the entire national economy, and helped lead to repeal. A great movie!--jhenryphillips
