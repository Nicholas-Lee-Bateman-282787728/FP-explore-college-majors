8755481,4,B01DCG7LQE,"The Blu-ray is a definite upgrade from the DVD, although not as much as one might expect. Much of the film, though not all, seems to have been shot with long lenses, low light and/or cheap filmstock. It almost looks blown up (enlarged) in places. Still, it's the best version I've seen since the theatrical release. What I didn't recall was how unusual Wm. Shatner's performance was; note the economy of gesture when he lets Joan Prather escape. A fun film.",1475712000,3,457,4.654320987654321
