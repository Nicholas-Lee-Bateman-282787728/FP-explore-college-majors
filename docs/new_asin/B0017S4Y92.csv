8267043,4,B0017S4Y92,"Lovely venue, fine performance, but I agree with those who say the camera work is obtrusive.  Perhaps under the impression that no one would find an old string quartet concert very interesting all by itself the directer decided to liven things up by constantly zooming and panning, darting restlessly from shot to shot, now looking down from above, now crouching to peep up from below at odd angles.  Luckily, when it gets to be too much you can always close your eyes.",1423353600,,469,4.7073170731707314
8267044,1,B0017S4Y92,"I agree with both reviewers so far (excellent performance and distracting camera), but I am MUCH more disturbed by the latter and cannot give this DVD anything more than a single star (despite the performance).  The filmmaker absolutely ruins the performance with his choppy editing and ridiculous camera angles.  At times, the camera is so high or so far away that the DVD has the look of a concert bootleg (and not a very good one at that).  The most absurd shot is at the end of the fifth movement (presto) of Quartet No. 14.  I would have liked to have seen this part of the performance.  It's a very exciting denouement of that portion of the quartet.  But what does the filmmaker do?  HE SHOOTS THE CEILING OF THE PERFORMANCE HALL!  Fortunately my copy came from the library.  Back it goes tomorrow.",1316044800,8,805,4.573426573426573
8267045,3,B0017S4Y92,"The performance is certainly first rate, but (unlike the previous reviewer) I found the camera work coming between me and the music much of the time.  Many camera changes and self-conscious panning and zooming do not add to the music. The ideal recording, for me at least, would involve a minimum of close ups, include all four performers in frame almost all the time, and little montage or heavy-handed editing. This recording calls attention to the camera placement and movement, whereas the best editing should generally go unnoticed, without artiness, without calling attention to itself.

When you have only 4 instruments, the fact that one instrument is silent is nearly as important as the difficult passage another may be playing, but this video includes a ton of mid shots, medium close ups where you lose track of the group, and even extreme close ups, techniques that may be appropriate for rock video, but are just distracting for a quartet.

In fairness, I have the impression that this sort of nervous, showy technique mars most of the music videos made in the 70's and earlier, so it may be unavoidable in older recordings; and having had my say about the video technique, there is still a good deal to be gained from this visual presentation of the recording.  In and of itself, the video alone is not a reason to pass on this recording, though you may get more from a good stereo CD (this video is mono) than from this visual presentation.",1309651200,10,1456,4.765873015873016
8267046,5,B0017S4Y92,"I've been a fan of the Juilliard String Quartet for more than forty years and have heard their live performances of all the Beethoven Quartets, one of the highlights of my concert-going career. I have heard the group in several of its iterations, going back to when Isadore Cohen, Raphael Hillyer and Claus Adam were its second violinist, violist and cellist. The make-up of the Quartet on this DVD recorded in 1975 is their original first violinist, Robert Mann, second violinist Earl Carlyss, violist Samuel Rhodes, and cellist Joel Krosnick. Krosnick had joined the group only a year earlier but he is clearly completely assimilated. This is probably the make-up that most middle-age and older music-lovers know best. Today only Rhodes and Krosnick remain in the group.

The DVD consists of performances of three of Beethoven's best-loved quartets -- the 4th Quartet in C Minor, Op. 18, No. 4; the 7th Quartet in F Major, Op. 59, No. 1 ('Rasumovsky No. 1'), and the 14th Quartet in C Sharp Minor, Op. 131. They are filmed in the gorgeous baroque Bibliotheksaal, Polling, Bavaria.

The Juilliard has always been known for its incisiveness, technical assurance, deep musicianship and the ability to convey the appropriate atmosphere of whatever they play, whether it be Mozart, Beethoven, Shostakovich or Bartk. Their CDs of all the Beethoven quartets have long been sought by quartet lovers the world over.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beethoven-Complete-String-Quartets/dp/B00006OA6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beethoven: Complete String Quartets</a>. However, as far as I know this is the only easily available DVD of the quartet. One might worry about the quality of both sound and visuals, given that the recording was made in 1975, but one need not make too many allowances for older technology. These are both visually and sonically satisfying. Visually, not much time is spent looking around the gilded walls of the Bibliotheksaal. Rather, we get the players in close-up much of the time, and the director, Hugo Kch, certainly knew his Beethoven: the close-ups match closely what is happening in the music and are not distracting at all. In fact, they enhance the impact of the music-making. As for the performances, I can only say that once again I fell in love with the playing of this magnificent quartet.

So, if you want a visual and sonic representation of one of the greatest quartets of the last half of the twentieth century, and an American institution, this DVD will fill the bill.
