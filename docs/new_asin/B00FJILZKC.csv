8616082,5,B00FJILZKC,"Please refer to the review I wrote for "" The Romance of the Rio Grande"". That review is how I feel about any and all roles in which Cesar Romero played or starred in. I love the confidence he displayed in his characters. He seems to have been that way in real life. I am biased concerning Mr Romero. Any movie he is in will always rate a five-star from me. The movie ""Frontier Marshall""  with Randolph Scott, Romero as Doc Holiday is him at his BEST!",1402790400,,450,4.172413793103448
8616083,5,B00FJILZKC,Ceasar Romero is a great Cisco Kid.  He was also a great actor.  His humor as Cisco makes the movie And as a ladies man he is quite the philospher.  A fun movie.,1393286400,,161,3.8181818181818183
