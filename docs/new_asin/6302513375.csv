477540,5,6302513375,"As Bob Hope reaches his 100th birthday Universal Studio's video unit will release 12 of his classic films on DVD. Among them this boxed set of classic ""Road pictures. The set includes in release order, The Road to Singapore, The Road to Zanzibar, The Road to Morocco and The Road to Utopia. The Road to Singapore the first outing for Bob & Bing and Dorothy (Dorothy Lamour)was originally intended as a vehicle for George Burns and Gracie Allen. It was apparent from the beginning that three had an immediate chemistry with each other and their intended audiences. Although the classic Road formula had not been quite jelled in this early outing there are still plenty of ad-Libs, gags and fun for every fan. The Road to Zanzibar is next it includes one of the most politically incorrect patty-cake routines involving an African Tribe ever put on film. Thank goodness for political incorrectness because political correctness is the death of comedy. You'll laugh till you hurt. Then comes The Road to Morocco considered by most to be the beginning of the true Road formula pictures, includes the now classic ""Moonlight Becomes You"" sung by Bing and incredible interplay and ad-libing with Bob&Bing. It's a miracle Dorothy was able to get a word in edgewise. Look for an Arab character played by Anthony Quinn. Rumor has it that when this picture was made the writer was sitting in on some of the filming, during a scene Bob flippently said to the writer, ""Call us if you hear one of your lines."" This movie is a gem and worthy of any film collection. It is loaded with inside movie industry jokes aimed at Paramount Pictures and of course a there are a couple of talking Camels. The Road to Utopia is an Alaskan adventure with the trio caught up in a gold mine scheme. The departure for this picture is it has an intrusive narration by the famed humorist Robert Benchley. Robert Benchley's intrusions are often insulting but they do capture the irony of the situations he describes. It's sort of like a Road Picture's visual ""Road Pictures for Dummies"". Great music including Bob & Bing's duet on ""Put It There Pal"", talking fish and histerical banter. This entire collection gets not only my thumb up but all the other  fingers as well!",1050537600,29,2236,4.733333333333333

477542,5,6302513375,"ROAD TO MOROCCO is a joke in your face comedy when shipwrecked stowaways Hope and Crosby land on the beach where they soon stumble upon the road sign, ""Road to Morocco.""  Their predictable and unpredictable jokes keep you chuckling from that point.  Small problem that they are travelling through sinister Arabian countryside; they break out singing that, ""Hey audience, we are on the Road to Morocco, we're liable to meet Dorothy Lamour, and if there's danger don't worry, Paramount will protect us because we're signed for five more years.""  Ultimately they reach the City.  That's where the Palace is located; where Princess Lamour searches for a husband.  Crosby sells Hope to pay a dinner check  and a few hundred Kolaks for himself.  Hope ends up in the Palace as Lamour's intended consort. Crosby has a change of heart about double-crossing Hope  and sets off to find and rescue him.  He finds Hope in the Palace entertained by Arab dancing girls who are dead ringers for Arabian clad UCLA cheerleaders.  Lamour, of course, is smitten  by Crosby, but has agreed to marry Hope because the Royal Oracle has predicted that her first husband [Hope in this case] would die in a week after the marriage, but the second husband would live a long life. Through a series of twists Hope learns of the Oracle, gives the job of Groom to Crosby, the Oracle learns that he oracled wrong [there were bugs on his telescope], Lamour jumps at the chance to marry Crosby and travel to the USA for the wedding, Desert Chief Anthony Quinn arrives with his entourage of cutthroats, he steals Lamour and the servant girl who is now infatuated with Hope, Hope and Crosby are banished to the desert, they eventually find Quinn's camp and . . . well, you must see the movie because the plot at this point is too complicated.  I would have to explain that Hope and Crosby find a solution to rescue the girls as they wisecrack, give hot-foots, and use pyrotechnic hi-jinks to end the film. This movie is Comedy Heritage.  I wish Paramount was still making the very funny, very entertaining Road movies.",993427200,10,2081,4.731301939058172

477585,5,6302513375,"Bob Hope and Bing Crosby + Dorothy Lamour made six ""Road"" pictures for Paramount between 1941 and 1953:
1) Road to Singapore - 1940
2) Road to Zanzibar - 1941
3) Road to Morocco - 1942
4) Road to Utopia - 1946
5) Road to Rio - 1947
6) Road to Bali - 1953 (the only one in color)

Paramount's pre-1948 catalog is now owned by Universal, which has a spotty record of reissuing these wonderful films on DVD.
Films 1-4 are available in three different editions:

Best, but most expensive, is the box on this page: 4 movies on 4 DVDs (2002). (available separately).

[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

Worst is 4 movies on 1 double-sided DVD (2004):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Road-With-Bob-Hope-and-Bing-Crosby-Collection-Road-to-Singapore-Road-to-Zanzibar-Road-to-Morocco-Road-to-Utopia/dp/B0001FGBZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Road With Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Collection (Road to Singapore/Road to Zanzibar/Road to Morocco/Road to Utopia)</a>
Double-sided DVDs fail at an alarming rate.

The most recent edition (2012) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bob-Hope-and-Bing-Crosby-Road-to-Comedy-Collection/dp/B008M4C1BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Road to Comedy Collection</a>
Two DVDs, with a double feature on one side of each disc (not double-sided, thank God).
Picture quality is equivalent to the 2002 4 disc version, but the price is a lot less.
Some of the ""extras"" from the 2002 4 disc version were left out. The only important loss was the movie trailers.
All three versions are closed-captioned.
At the price, this is the new recommended version.

Annoyingly, films 5 and 6 were left out of each collection.
Paramount stupidly allowed the copyright to expire on these films, so they are now in the Public Domain.
Lots of inexpensive copies are available on DVD from various cheapo labels.
The situation was somewhat rectified in 2010 when Shout Factory released an authorized 3 DVD collection:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bob-Hope-Collection-The-Lemon-Drop-Kid-Road-to-Bali-Road-to-Rio-My-Favorite-Brunette-The-Seven-Little-Foys/dp/B0042FUHV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bob Hope Collection (The Lemon Drop Kid / Road to Bali / Road to Rio / My Favorite Brunette / The Seven Little Foys)</a>

Less expensive, almost as good:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Road-to-Bali-Road-to-Rio/dp/B0001F0WM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Road to Bali / Road to Rio</a>

I only wish Universal had the sense to issue the six film collection complete in a nice box on 3 double-feature DVDs (NOT 2-sided!).
Maybe even blu-ray.

P.S. Missing from my list is the seventh film, The Road to Hong Kong (1962), but it is owned by MGM, not Universal:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-to-Hong-Kong/dp/B00006L930/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road to Hong Kong</a>&nbsp;- or -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Hope-MGM-Movie-Legends-Collection-Alias-Jesse-James-Boy-Did-I-Get-the-Wrong-Number-The-Facts-of-Life-I-ll-Take-Sweden-The-Princess-and-the-Pirate-The-Road-to-Hong-Kong-They-ve-Got-Me-Covered/dp/B000WC3A08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Hope MGM Movie Legends Collection (Alias Jesse James/Boy, Did I Get the Wrong Number/The Facts of Life/I'll Take Sweden/The Princess and the Pirate/The Road to Hong Kong/They've Got Me Covered)</a>
The boys are a bit long-in-the tooth (Dorothy Lamour is reduced to a cameo).
Not as good as the first six, but still worth a look.

P.P.S. All seven films are available in a boxed set, but its only available in the United Kingdom (issued in 2005).
They are region 2 DVDs, which means American DVD players won't play them.
Available on Amazon UK (amazon.co.uk):
ASIN: B0009W09GE
To view them you will need a region-free DVD player.
These machines are ""gray market"" (not ""black market"" which would be illegal).
Removing the region 1 encoding chip is considered ""tampering"" and voids the manufacturer's warranty.
Most sellers provide their own 30 day or 90 day warranty.

477586,5,6302513375,"Do all 4 films in this set have the 1.33:1 aspect ratio ?

I can't find my answer in any of the 25 customer reviews.

Yes, I know in the ""Product Details"" it says they are, BUT, a number of times in the past, this info has been wrong, especially when there are multiple films in a set.

ALSO, if they are in 1.33:1 ratio, was this their original ratio when shown in theaters ?

The first four Road series movies are all here, and they're all delightful to watch.  I managed to watch all four of them at one sitting on a cold, snowy Saturday afternoon (WITH popcorn and a Coke!) and enjoyed myself tremendously.

No this not the complete set but it does include some of the great trips that Bob and Bing took together. There is nothing like a Bob Hope and Bing Crosby movie and the picture is so clear.

477602,5,6302513375,"Where has the Golden Age of Hollywood gone?  It's available in one box.  Bing Crosby and Bob Hope keep you laughing in this collection of endearing films. Bing Crosby woos the ladies with his Crooning, Bob Hope keeps them entertained with his sly wit. As the series progress they make refrences to their previous adventures, and they even take time to include you the veiwer in on the joke.

  The On The Road series of films revolve around the premise that Bob and Bing are broke knock around guys, that fall for the same woman (Dorthy Lamour) and the antics that suround them as they both try to win the girl and save the day.

  These movies set the tone for all ""Buddy"" flicks that have followed.  A great set of movies for the family to sit around and watch on a Friday night. Don't forget the pop corn. I highly recommend this Box set.",1123200000,3,841,4.374193548387097
477603,5,6302513375,"What to say. As a younger viewer, 18, of the road to series, mostly Bing Crosby, I can only tell you that this is not only funny and sweet.  It's a movie for all ages, without the needed worrying of partial nudity or inappropriate language for younger viewers, or mature viewers.  Bing and Bob, Hope and Crosby : ), have excellent chemistry, they ad-lib mostly because of the fact that they work so well together.  This has great picture quality, and humor for all times.  I recommend this set and all others that follow.  The only drawback of the pack, is that it only contains the first four, (Road to Singapore, Zanzibar, Morocco, and Utopia), it is missing the hilarious other 3, (Road to Rio, Bali, and Hong Kong), and the title being attributed to Bob Hope.  I love them both, but Bing steals the scenes.  For Hope and Crosby fans alike. GREEAAAAAAAAAAT!!!",1071878400,4,862,4.594771241830065

477605,5,6302513375,"Pre-""Call Me Bwana"" Bob Hope!! Is there anything better? NO ONE was better with a one-liner or an ad lib than old Ski-Nose! And Bing playing against him, never ceasing to amaze with his OWN ability to toss off a few!

Of the movies in this collection, ""Utopia"" is the best, with the slyest one liners, some fourth-wall breaking and lots of ""in"" jokes. And ALL the movies, at least on the VHS version, were crisp as could be!

The one thing you'll notice about the ""Road"" movies, is that the humor in them seems WAAAYY ahead of its time....like something you'd see in the fifties or sixties rather than  the forties. Hope and Crosby were to comedy films what ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" were to late thirties drama.... trendsetting and exceptional! You couldn't possibly go wrong getting this set...if only it had ""Hong Kong"" and ""Bali"" in it....! (Not to mention ""Rio""...)

Who is ever going to replace these two guys? George Clooney and Brad Pitt? Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey? I don't think so.

477608,5,6302513375,"This DVD of three Hope-Crosby road movies is of exceptional quality. I've seen these movies dozens of times and have never seen them so crisp, clean and unblemished. The sound quality is also superb. I felt as if I was sitting in a movie theatre in the 40's because the presentation of the films seemed so new. Each DVD contains the original trailer for the three films as well as some trivia and bloopers.
As for the Hope-Crosby teaming, it is a mystery to me why they remain so under-appreciated by critics and fans alike. Bob Hope was a comic master who possessed impeccable timing and was simply hilarious. His character in the road films was always an immature Casanova wannabe who was slick with the one-liners. It's a loveable, irreplaceable part of Americana. Bing was an unconventional yet brilliant straight man. I say ""unconventional"" because he got almost as many laughs as Hope. Their screen chemistry remains dynamic and undated. Dorothy Lamour adds glamour and some humor as well, but the main reason to cherish these movies is because of Bing and Bob.
This set comprises the three best road films, with Road to Utopia being my favorite. The characters of Sperry and McGirk are absolute classics and their swaggering scenes in the Alaskan saloon are the apex of Bing and Bob comedy. Watch for the ending which somehow escaped the odious Hayes office. It's way before its time and a total delight.
