8489684,4,B005ZHZXMI,"This disc consists of two major parts: a documentary by Miguel Vallecillo (51 minutes), consisting of songs from Paris concerts and an extended interview with Camarn; and a complementary programme (35 minutes) of other songs from the same concert series. Extras include a video clip of ""Como el agua"" (5 minutes), and a gallery of photographs.

The documentary consists of a concert at the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris, interspersed with parts of the interview, as follows:

01 Que mala gitana eres (Sole)
02 Interview (Part 1)
03 De la raz de un olivo (Tangos)
04 Interview (Part 2)
05 Soundcheck
06 Interview (Part 3)
07 Vi relucir dos luceros (Alegras)
08 Interview (Part 4)
09 Ay minero (Tarantas)
10 Interview (Part 5)
11 Te lo digo por tu bien (Fandangos)
12 Interview (Part 6)
13 Cante de fin (Buleras)

The video quality, and occasionally the sound quality too, are a bit rough, for which the producer apologises in the notes. But, Camarn is still Camarn, even if apparently singing at the bottom of a well.

The interview shows Camarn at home in La Lnea (with much washing hanging on the line in the background). It has no subtitles available, so if you don't speak Spanish, you're out of luck.

The other programme consists of four cantes as follows:

01 Vi relucir dos luceros (Alegras) (different take)
02 La vida, la vida es (Bulerias)
03 El fondo de los mares (Tangos)
04 T te fuiste al alba (Bulerias)

The video and sound quality throughout are better than in the first programme; although there is a strange glitch in ""La vida, la vida es"" (at 17'05"" into the programme), presumably denoting some sort of edit for whatever reason. The alegras, incidentally, are played in C (or, more accurately, in C-shapes), as is customary in Cdiz.

The guitarist throughout is Tomatito, and the more I see of him, the better I think he is: absolutely solid, incredible punch, never tries to show off, always understands exactly what Camarn is doing. There's just the two of them &mdash; no bass, no cajn &mdash; pure Flamenco as it's always been, which is just the way I like it.

The video clip of ""Como el agua"" is quite interesting too, with Camarn playing guitar along with Tomatito, and shots of him going walkabout by the banks of the Seine.

I recommend this DVD to you even if you don't speak Spanish &mdash; you can always use the Skip button on the interview.",1329177600,,2368,4.670673076923077
