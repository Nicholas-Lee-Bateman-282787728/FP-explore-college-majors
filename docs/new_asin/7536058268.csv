8208053,5,7536058268,"I bought a copy of this movie off of lutatou on eBay. The description says it's region free, but my DVD players recognize it as region 6. Make sure you have a compatible player. The main menu has selections written in both Chinese and English, and subtitles are available in English, French, Chinese, and simplified Chinese. The English translation is okay - here and there, there are a few literal translations that don't carry the same meaning, but you can still understand everything that's going on. The copy I bought came in a cardboard sleeve, and it looks like you could insert the sleeve into a DVD jewel case if you wanted to keep it on a shelf.

Nothing has happened to make me worry so far. The transfer looks decent, audio's fine, the menus work. There are basically no operational problems.

I saw this movie a few years back on IFC, under the title ""Ugetsu"". It's a fantastic film with beautiful photography, awesome traditional music, and a well-developed story (With ghost mansions! WooOoOoOoo!). If you're looking at this product, you probably already know a bit about the film, and if not, information if freely available online. I can't say how this DVD compares to the Criterion release, but if you're looking for an inexpensive copy of Ugetsu, this is a good buy.",1299888000,,1284,4.753363228699552
