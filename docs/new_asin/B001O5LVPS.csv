8329789,5,B001O5LVPS,"In the latest volume of the popular Disney television series, a total of five hilarious and fun ""Hannah Montana"" episodes to satisfy the Miley fans and the entire family!

Having a child that is a big fan of various Disney series, ""HANNAH MONTANA"" has been part of our household family viewing for years.  So, suffice to say that I have watched many episodes of ""HANNAH MONTANA"" to get a good feel of what the series is about and that the DVD releases tend to revolve around a certain theme than episodic episodes in order.  Thus here comes a new ""HANNAH MONTANA"" DVD titled ""KEEPING IT REAL"" showing a lesson to viewers that one should be true to themselves.

For those not familiar with the television show that launched the career of pop star, Miley Cyrus, ""HANNAH MONTANA"" is a popular Disney Channel television series which started back in 2006  and revolves around a family of three.

Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) is a normal teenage girl but when she goes on stage and records an album, she dons a blonde wig and is known as the popular pop idol Hannah Montana.

Her father/manager Robbie (real life father, Billie Ray Cyrus) has given her the dual identity so she can live a normal teenage life.  She lives with her brother Jackson who is a bit of goof off who tends to get himself into some sort of predicament at home or at work at the hot dog stand owned by young entrepreneur Rico (Moises Arias).

For Miley/Hannah, she is fortunate to have her best friend Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment) and Oliver Oken (Mitchel Musso) around at times to be her voice of reason and to help bail her out of trouble.

The ""KEEPING IT REAL"" DVD features a total of four episodes, with a fifth bonus episode included.  Included are:

  1. The Test of My Love - Miley falls for Trey, a song of a rich investor.  Afraid that she may not be classy enough for him, she changes her style to win his attention and going so far to lie and say that she lived in London.  But when she brings Trey's family over to her home, perhaps her lie may be a bit too much for Trey and his entire family.
  2. Don't Stop `Til You Got the Phone - Miley gets a new cell phone but when she's enjoying her current one, the new latest fad for cell phones become the rage and now Miley wants her father to buy her the latest phone.  But because she just bought a newer one, her father tells her no.  So, Miley needs to make some cash without her father knowing.  So, after hearing about how paparazzi make a lot of money taking pictures of her, she and Lilly become paparazzi photographers and their next mission to make a lot of money is to sneak into Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and take embarrassing photos of him.  Meanwhile, Jackson avoids his father's advice and gets a bad sunburn.
  3. Yet Another Side of Me - Hannah Montana visits her fashion designer Dahliano to design a cool outfit for her upcoming ""Sunshine Dolls"" Presentation event but when she meets Isis, the Queen of Pop, Isis tells her that she needs to change her music in order to keep herself fresh and interesting to her fans.  Meanwhile, Jackson and Rico work on their friendship.
  4. We're All On This Date Together - During a celebrity auction for charity with stars such as Ray Romano and Donnie Osmond, Hannah Montana is happy that Johnny (High School Musical's Corbin Bleu) is bidding a lot of money for her but Rico challenges Johnny and thus Hannah must go on a double date with both guys.  The episode marks the second time Bleu has appeared in the series to reprise his role of Johnny.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Hannah Montana"" is presented in Full Screen (1:33:1) and is featured in Dolby Digital Stereo Sound with also a French and Spanish audio track available.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The DVD comes with two major special features:

  * BONUS EPISODE: Ready, Set, Don't Drive - Miley tries to get her driver's license but when she fails, she uses her charm as ""Hannah Montana"" to retake the test.  Unfortunately, without her father knowing, Hannah takes the car out for a spin and gets busted by the police.
  * Miley's Makeover: Hannah Gets A New Look! - A four minute featurette featuring clips from Hannah Montana's concert and Hannah hanging out with her fashion designers and talking about the wardrobe for her concert which is inspired by 80's influences and making them modern.

Also, there is a coupon with a code to obtain a free movie ticket for the upcoming ""HANNAH MONTANA"" movie (in theaters on April 10).

JUDGMENT CALL:

For ""HANNAH MONTANA"" fans or parents with children who adore Miley Cyrus, ""KEEPING IT REAL"" features five episodes about being true to oneself.  The episodes are lighthearted, hilarious and fun and safe for children.

This volume has a bit of star power featured as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Ray Romano, Donnie Osmond and Corbin Bleau make an appearance in an episode.

The episodes are not in any particular order, just episodes that focus on the theme of ""KEEPING IT REAL"" and most of the episodes are from the second season of ""Hannah Montana"" (2007-2008), while the bonus episode ""Ready, Set, Don't Drive"" is from Season 3.

Overall, as a father of a child who enjoys the series, the show definitely had it's hilarious moments and for five episodes for a low price, you really can't go wrong with it.  Fans of Miley Cyrus and ""Hannah Montana"" won't be disappointed.",1238630400,10,5345,4.561385099685205
