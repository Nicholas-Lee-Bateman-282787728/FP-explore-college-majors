8716357,4,B00XNKF2UM,"An entertaining film about Gauguin that I think misses his character somewhat.  The image is DVD quality, a concern I had since I had only a VHS version before and have been burned by VHS transfers posing as factory issue.

But I do have a warning.  The film was a cooperative European project and while most of the film is in English there are sections that are only in Danish.  The optional subtitles are Korean so the Danish sections are understandable only if you know Danish or can read Korean.  I recall the VHS I had - and still wish I had - provided subtitles for the Danish.",1506470400,,583,4.361111111111111
