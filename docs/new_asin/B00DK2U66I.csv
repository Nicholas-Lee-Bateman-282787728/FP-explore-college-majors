8594064,5,B00DK2U66I,"I really wasn't expecting much from this anime, it sounded pretty cliche and I haven't seen a die for anime in ages,however the story, animation and character were splendid!

I don't have the time to type the summary, you can read about the plot anywhere.

No spoilers, the story was interesting, cliffhangers in nearly every episode, awesome art and animation.
A real thriller ride.
Reminded me of Code Geass and Guilty Crown.
If you love action, romance, and being glued to your chair, check out Blast of Tempest.
