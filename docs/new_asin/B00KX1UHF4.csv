6453128,4,B00KX1UHF4,"I thought it was a charming, and touching movie.. I've missed seeing Richard on the screen. Tatiana did a great job along for the ride with Richard. It is defiantly worth watching.",1431648000,,180,4.65625
6453129,1,B00KX1UHF4,"I WAS very disappointed with this film, for various reasons, but first one of all was the bad horrific streaming conditions in which I was exposed to when I decided to initially buy this movie thru Amazon Instant Video. This having nothing to do with my internet provider or and equipment, as I don't and have not issue when playing others within my library.
Now on, to the movie even though It got interrupted at least 6 times thru the streaming and the captions did not work until 45 minutes after movie was on and when they started working they reproducing the dialog of the film ""from the beginning of the movie""!..
Richard Dreyfuss has always been and continues to be one of my favorite actors of all times, from ""close encounters"", to the ""fockers"" to ""goodbye Girl"" among countless others classics under his belt. one of my best favorites he made was something he made long ago by the name of ""the competition"" with Amy Irving. Now this movie ""Cas and Dylan"" was a mislead from the beginning as they first of all do not allow you to rent the film if you choose that instead of buying it, like many others get the option for you to do so. You watch the previews they choose to show you and mostly what you see is the two or three parts within the film with a couple of comedic moments giving you the impression this is a mostly a comedy/drama
which turned out to be it wasn't either. It is just mostly poor written, bad script, direction and there were times when Mr. Dreyfuss felt he had a knife to his throat to spit out his next line through the film. It seems to me, he agreed to make this film for two reasons and those are as follows:
he needed the extra few thousands dollars (I hate when some actors do this and yes they do) they offered him to be in this so it can have name recognition and the other to maybe help with the
hope to success career of ""Tatiana Maslany"" whose timing was really bad during interactions with her new friend ""Cas"" (R.D) whom she framed, conned, call it what you want to get him to give her a ride out of town, doesn't matter  where she was going, where he was headed that was fine by her. I am not too familiar with Tatiana's acting career but I got to tell you this one, did not help her at all. This turns out to be a very bad depressing movie and anyone out there that suffers from ""depression and anxiety"" and has had any kind of ""suicidal thoughts"" I will recommend this one is not for you, so stay away!",1430265600,,2452,4.261802575107296
6453130,5,B00KX1UHF4,"I loved this little movie.  I laughed, I cried, and I got attached to the characters.  Watching their dynamic relationship develop was one of the best parts of this film for me.  2 great actors that made what had the potential to turn out as just  another ""rainy day"" movie into something I'll definitely watch again and recommend to friends.",1429315200,,342,4.65
6453131,5,B00KX1UHF4,Absolutely one of the best movies ever!...Great story and brilliant performances!,1417996800,,81,6.454545454545454
6453132,5,B00KX1UHF4,"This was an incredible journey. I have seen nearly every movie from 2013-2014. I actually watched this three-three and a half times before I got exhausted from staying up so late and went to bed. I highly recommend this movie on a rainy day. This to me reminds me of the capability that Richard Dreyfuss had with making you moved by acting capabilities when he did the famous ""Mr. Hollands Opus"". He goes on a journey with a sprouting, youthful girl that has one path to live while he suffers from the lures of death. Actually, it is incredibly accurate, that he doesn't really suffer, because he was a doctor and knows the visages of death. Every doctor examines how softly life can be taken away. This movie shows the parallel of how death creates easy flow and life creates hard dynamics. Dreyfuss, somehow found one of the perfect subjects to magnet his emotions on screen. This will be added to my DVD shelf when there is ample cash at hand. I usually get my DVD's used, but I'll think on how long I have to wait- because right now the price is near $40.00. I do want to wait until it drops, but I don't want life to pass me by. And RICHARD DREYFUSS, I know you are reading this- I meant it all. My hat's off to you. This film shows me that if there were 197 Countries, you'd be one of them!!! :D :D :D. I'd love to work beside you someday. And I will. Gina is my Amazon psuedo-name. My real name is Nathan Anthony Carter. Hope to see you someday in person.",1413676800,,1462,4.281588447653429
6453133,3,B00KX1UHF4,"I'm a huge Tatiana Maslany fan.  She does not disappoint, however, this movie suffers as her character (Dylan), is not very well developed and is portrayed on one level throughout most of the film.  They should have given Maslany some quieter moments as it would have given a lot more depth to the story.  Also, I found the ending to be a bit predictable in terms of some kind gestures on the part of the Cas character.  If you are a Maslany fan (and if you've seen Orphan Black how could you not be), you will like it, but may be disappointed as it doesn't showcase her acting talent that we all know from watching her on Orphan Black.",1411171200,6,636,4.319327731092437
6453134,2,B00KX1UHF4,"With Orphan Black being one of my favorite shows, naturally I would want to see Tatiana Maslany be in something else between the seasons. And while she does guest star on other shows, unfortunately those are shows Im just not into. So finding out she is in a movie is quite a treat. Though I cant say the movie itself is one.

Characters & Story

Dylan (Tatiana Maslany) is an eccentric girl who is very outgoing and has dreams of becoming a professional writer. Dr. Cas Pepper (Richard Dreyfuss) is a widow, very straight laced and plain, and just wants to spend the rest of his life in some peace. So, how do these two meet? Well, in Dylans pursuit of understanding suffering, she decides to observe the patients at the hospital where Dr. Pepper works at. Then, with her seeing him intently writing something, thinking he is a fellow writer, she decides to force her way into his life, without an invitation, and as many times as he tries pushing her out, or outright abandoning her, something keeps bringing these two opposites together. Leading to, eventually, Dr. Pepper giving up on trying to live the rest of his life in peace, and just learning to deal with, accept, and eventually come to love this odd young lady who has somehow found a place within his heart.

Praise

When the film has perhaps 20 to 30 minutes left and the manic personality of Dylan and depressive personality of Cas start to get balanced out, the movie becomes slightly ok. For with them both revealing what the near future holds for them, you begin to actually get a sense that the characters are finally getting developed. We see Dylans fears for her future and the lack of hope Cas has in his, and after their friendship and interactions stop seeming so forced, you finally get some sense that these two could actually intermingle without Cas trying to abandon Dylan the first chance he gets.

Criticism

But until that point in the movie where both characters seem to become human, Dylan presents herself as a highly annoying character and Cas personality is seemingly made to compensate her nature by coming off as boring as possible. Now, as for how annoying Dylan is? Well, with her being a 20 something year old who lounges around a hospital to try to vicariously suffer; someone who never shuts up, or says anything intriguing; and also pretty much forces her way into Cas life, but seems ready to abandon it when she realizes what he cant give her is fun and games anymore, it makes the majority of the time we spend with Dylan to be a test of patience. Though what makes things worse is that you don't really get any real sort of backstory when it comes to Dylan to even really understand her.

A problem Cas also has for his back story also is ignored. But it is a bigger tragedy for Cas character since we are introduced to his former wife and with him being a doctor it really seems like he could have been given some depth. As opposed to what the film decides to waste time on which is us thinking Cas may have accidently murdered Dylans boyfriend. Much less the constant back and forth of Cas not wanting Dylan around him and then him allowing her to return with him seemingly regretting the decision as soon as it is made.

Overall: Skip It

Though the last half hour or so of the film was far better than what preceded it, unfortunately it isn't a complete 180 degree turn which makes the film worth watching. If anything: the climax of the film leads to a rushed development of the characters, which feels sort of shallow. For after us seeing Cas push away Dylan constantly, him suddenly feeling for the girl, and acting like a father figure because she faced disappointment just seemed a bit weird. If just because they waited so long to turn him into such a figure that it felt a little too little too late. Hence the Skip It label for the film tries to do a last minute save, but it is so below average throughout that to recommend this for anything besides background noise for a nap would mean I was getting paid to write this.",1410652800,,4032,4.504787961696306
6453135,5,B00KX1UHF4,"I'm quite fond of Tatiana Maslany, but don't mistake this for bias - I wasn't a big fan of Picture Day. This film, however, made me cry and laugh. Tat is great in the role of a troubled, aspiring writer on the run from... everything and Richard Gere perfectly captures the pain and confusion of seeing the end of your life on the horizon and suddenly being saddled with a loony drifter.

This unique take on an odd-couple / road movie is worth a view, but not at 45 dollars for the DVD. I imported it from Amazon.ca and it cost less than 30 including the shipping...",1409443200,3,566,4.289719626168225
6453136,5,B00KX1UHF4,"Fun and cute road trip movie. If you're a fan of either main actor, you'll enjoy this!! I'd wait for the price to come down though, $45 is a bit absurd.",1408752000,2,152,3.935483870967742

6453145,5,B00KX1UHF4,"A very laugh out loud film.
Tatiana Maslany carried the movie from beginning to end.
Richard Dreyfuss plays a  man at the end of his life with nothing left to look forward too suddenly caught up with a young woman filled with youth ,energy and impatience  who is simply on a quest to discover everything that life holds for her.
What starts out as a simple act of kindness involving two strangers sharing a ride ends up being much more for both of them.",1459036800,,453,4.380952380952381

Just like Clark, Maslany is showing she is not a one trick pony with film being the next challenge won. She is enjoyable as the never quiet Dylan who is just who Cas (Dr. Pepper) didn't know he needed in his life. Its hard to describe this movie without giving away the plot, so I will end with saying that it is the perfect bittersweet comedy.",1434844800,2,518,4.40625
