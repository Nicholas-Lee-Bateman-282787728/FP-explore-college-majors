He does not have many video releases for how long he has been doing stand up...so that makes this one very special as I think it is his best video release.  I also like his short film at the end.

2741256,4,B000MRA56K,"There are three parts to this DVD. The first part consists of a half-hour+ view of Wright's stand-up appearance at Toronto's Elgin Theater. His act includes some of his signature koan-like observations. ""I'm addicted to placebos. How can I tell when I've kicked the habit?""

The audience's laughter is sometimes so explosive, it blasts away Wright's subsequent one-liner. However, most of his brilliance comes through.

The next section consists of a short film that Wright wrote and co-directed. I thought it was going to be a parody of some somber, sepia documentary, such as Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" series. Although there might be traces of parody here, I eventually realized that ""When the Leaves Blow Away"" was generally meant as a serious reflection on life and death. It ends up being fairly poignant, but a bit misplaced amid the viewer's expectation of comedy.

Finally, there is a clip of one of Wright's early stand-up performances. This is just a snippet lasting only about two minutes.

So the main value of this DVD is in its first section. That segment of classic Wright is too brief, but will make a good introduction to Wright if you've never heard him before - and will be a good addition to your collection of cerebral humor if you're already a long-time fan.",1319673600,,1277,4.844036697247707
2741257,2,B000MRA56K,"Have heard Steven Wright on the radio - hilarious. Purchased this DVD w/high expectations, but am disappointed. None of the funny lines I've heard before are on this SHORT-lived live comedy act. Most of the DVD is made up of a movie he did that I really never understood, nor found interesting or humerous.",1298937600,,306,4.685185185185185
2741258,4,B000MRA56K,"Ok so the title to the review is punny, but so is Steven Wright. One of the smartest comedians ever, He's in top form in his drab, odd offbeat comedy, often saying jokes that take 3-5 seconds to sink in before you chuckle or bust out laughing. Wright is at his best when he's at his drollest and the pacing of this standup is vintage Steven Wright. If you like your comedy to be smart and not need F bombs and cussing the get a laugh out of you, you should definitely see, listen and learn from one of the best.",1246665600,,511,4.069306930693069
2741259,1,B000MRA56K,"I was introduced to Steve Wright's work during an acupuncture/massage therapy session & laughed until the tears were running down my face; maybe it was a temporary euphoria thing (or maybe this vid was not representative of the rest of his stuff - I hope not!), but it was mind-numbingly boring.  I kept waiting for the slyly relevant zingers I remembered from the CD I'd heard, but they were woefully scarce.  I even closed my eyes to ascertain if it was a visual thing.  Not so.  Perhaps I should try a CD or another vid.",1236902400,3,523,4.473684210526316
2741260,4,B000MRA56K,"I bought this because Steven Wright's ""I Have a Pony"" is one of my favorite comedy albums of all time.  I've listened to ""I Have A Pony"" dozens of times and it still makes me laugh.  In this DVD Steven Wright is a little harder to understand because he does mumble as other reviewers have said.  (It's not just me - my husband had trouble understanding him too.)  So you have to pay close attention to really get everything.  His timing is incredible - the stand-up routine is 42 minutes of one-liners timed so that just as you're starting to realize how funny the preceding nonsequiter was, he hits you with another one.  If you liked the song ""Rachel"" from ""I Have A Pony,"" you will find more of the same great comic songs during which Wright accompanies himself on an acoustic guitar.  He seems to be actually a pretty good guitarist, which makes me wish someone would put together a DVD of just his songs (I assume he has more).

The short B&W film on this DVD is inconsistent, however, with the stand-up routines, but the advertisements don't really explain that, otherwise I would have given it a ""5.""  The short film is not only (as other reviewers have said) dark and nihilistic, but . . . well, kind of creepy.  Still, I really enjoyed the stand-up.  I thought the DVD was worth it for that alone.  If you like Mitch Hedberg and Demetri Martin, you will probably like this as well.",1235952000,,1390,4.450592885375494
2741261,3,B000MRA56K,"I purchased this disc thinking that it was an actual stand-up routine.  I does indeed have a stand-up routine on the disc but only about half of it.  The other half is a ""movie"" that is not that funny and makes no sense at all.  Pick another Steven Wright release.",1231804800,2,264,4.24

genius. I bought a vhs of his about 20 years ago that was on a par with
this concert, arguably his best two. His comedy must be experienced about 5 times to fully grasp the nested sublevels of his humour. Glad to see him back in the form he is a master of, instead of those insipid TV appearances.

2741294,5,B000MRA56K,"I've got several of Steven Wright's CDs/DVDs and got to see him in concert/tour/show once too (I'm Bucky Goldstein.) This was more of him at his best. I didn't connect with the short movie as much but it was still funny too. I was trying to explain ""joke grenade"" and ""mental humor"" to my kids and finally just put in this DVD. It was great to watch him tell a joke, look over at my kids and watch that short delay as the joke would sink in (I once worked as a proofreader for a skywriting company). He's always been one of my favorite comedians and I've loved his type of ""confused"" humor, always done in his monotone, disinterested flow (pointing to his shadow on stage, ""this guy's been following me all night."") I love that. Great stuff again.",1209945600,,747,4.381294964028777

2741296,2,B000MRA56K,"My husband and I did not enjoy this particular comedy skit as much as we have enjoyed other Steven Wright pieces. The ending video was very dark and serious: not what we were intending to view within a ""comedy"".",1206576000,3,211,4.435897435897436
2741297,3,B000MRA56K,"The strengths in Wright's early work were that his humor was much smarter and much cleaner than most comics, while being fall-off-the-chair funny.

This work is that funny--Wright's genius for wit is still working. But he relies much more than he used to on vulgarity.

And then there's the short film.  I'd like to watch that with someone who gets it, because I didn't.  It was all Wright's blandness without any of his brilliance.  I didn't even make it through.",1199577600,3,464,4.75

2741325,2,B000MRA56K,"The standup comedy at the beginning was OK, but not the best Steven Wright material that I have heard.  However, most of the video is a movie that he made that was very boring and not funny at all.  The ad for the video did not mention this movie (except maybe in very small print) and it took up most of the DVD.
The jokes in the comedy routine at the beginning seemed more like filler to make a DVD than his original humor.  There is short video of an old standup routine from years ago at the end of the DVD, but the quality is poor and you can hardly understand what he is saying.
I think that Steven Wright is one of the funniest comedians around.  Several years ago, I caught him on a radio station in Missoula, Montana, and I had to stop the car because I was laughing so hard that I thought that I would get into an accident.  However, this DVD lack a lot of the originality and quality that Steven used to have.",1185062400,5,920,4.088888888888889
2741326,5,B000MRA56K,"This DVD special is Steven Wright alone on a stage with his guitar, which he picks up twice to play a song.  Most of his humor is short clever puns, things that people often do not think of by themselves.

The volume is not very loud, and with his low deep voice you will need to crank your surround sound or tiny speakers, whichever you have.

I would recommend watching this with many people who have different personalities.  His humor will really bring out different emotional responses from people, and this can be quite fun to make fun of.

There is a short film included in this DVD - I would suggest watching this in a seperate sitting from the stand up...well sit down routine.",1184630400,,686,4.456
2741327,5,B000MRA56K,"I bought this DVD because I remembered seeing Steven Wright on TV years ago and laughing until my sides hurt. Well, I have to say it happened again. With all of the negativity in the world he is just what the doctor ordered. In this day of trash humor Steven Wright's short, sometimes one liners just makes you laugh. If you want a great time treat yourself yo this DVD.",1184544000,,370,4.3
2741328,5,B000MRA56K,"The stand-up portion of this DVD is the main attraction, and while it is too short (42 minutes), if you're a fan of his dry, surreal humor, this classic material will have you pausing the DVD so you can quit laughing long enough to catch the next jokes.  By the time it was over, my sides hurt.

The short film ""One Soldier"" is another animal altogether.  At first, it appears to be an obvious parody of art-house cinema from Federico Fellini to Jim Jarmusch (with Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"" being an obvious influence), but as it progresses, it darkens, until by the end, you're left somewhat shellshocked by Wright's seemingly bleak, almost nihilistic, and deeply disturbing worldview.  Avoid watching it if you're remotely depressed.

As for the early material, it was good but disappointingly short.  Someone else mentioned the wealth of classic Wright material out there, and why none of it has made its way to DVD is a mystery.  I've got the Comic Relief shows, and his sets are always among the highlights.  So why can't they give fans some of the classic shows from that era on DVD?

Still, even at its length, this DVD is well-worth the price.  If you're a Steven Wright fan, it's essential.",1184457600,5,1195,4.701923076923077

On a good day he can outdo Groucho Marx. Some of the material on this DVD isn't up to his best, but my main beef about this offering has to do with its length. The live set on this disc lasts only 42 minutes. Then there's a half-hour short film that's long on arty B&W cinematography but short on laughs. And then there's a grab from a 1988 performance which lasts - wait for it - a whole 2 minutes and 16 seconds. Given the paucity of Wright material on the market, it's a pity the people behind this DVD didn't put together a far more generous package.

The film ""one soldier"" that was at the end, written and directed by Steven is alright, but I just lost interest about 10 minutes into it, so that is why i did not give this a 5.  However, the bonus featurette of 2:30 seconds of an old show in boston in 1988 is a classic bit of his routine, a fine touch to finish off this piece.

Unfortunately, this DVD does NOT have any subtitles available.  Since Stephen generally speaks in low tones and often covers his lips with the microphone, I miss way too many lines.",1479945600,,303,5.02

Just saw Steven live in Las Vegas last month and although some of the same jokes still being used, every time you hear him, it's like you never heard him before!
