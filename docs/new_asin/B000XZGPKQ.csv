3010168,4,B000XZGPKQ,"This is an excellent documentary on Bleeding Kansas.

The great thing about it was that, unlike other documentaries, the people behind it went as far as hiring actors to play out the roles of actual historical figures and everyday men and women of Bleeding Kansas. The actors were very believable in both interviews and in acting out of major events and battles.

I am doing a lot of researching on abolitionist John Brown, and I was a little disappointed with the way 'Bad Blood' creators treated him couple of times.

The narrator introduced John Brown as a man who came to Kansas not to settle, but to fight proslavery forces. While it was true, the documentary failed to give the context in which John Brown came to Kansas: his sons came there 6 months before John Brown to claim land and to settle, but they were threatened by proslavery forces, so they had to call they father to join and help them.

As for the Pottawatomie killings, the film narrator explains that James Doyle, one of the men that was murdered by Brown, ""came to Kansas simply to work his claim and mind his own business."" However, James Doyle and his sons were avid members of the proslavery Law and Order party, and sat on the grand jury at the court session held by proslavery judge Sterling Cato who issued warrants for the arrest of John Brown and the sons. I would hardly call it ""minding his own business."" Brown's killings are in no way admirable or defensible, but they are explainable in the context of his times.

I feel that most of the film is quite accurate and tries not to be biased, but aforementioned episodes leave a bad aftertaste while watching such a well-researched and well-made documentary.",1264118400,10,1690,4.638795986622074

8230339,1,B000XZGPKQ,"The unwatchable combination of Ken Burns type mournful music, sad singing, and repenetant-looking live actors mouthing the words of past speakers was intolerable to me.

I felt as though the presenters were trying to manipulate me me, rather than just present the very interesting facts.

So, I have no idea what they were trying to tell me. It seemed scatter-shot.

I found the entire production phony, confused, and nebulous.

And I loathe Ken Burns.",1524268800,,452,5.0675675675675675
8230340,1,B000XZGPKQ,"The history of Bleeding Kansas is far less known than that of the Civil War. However, if you expect this documentary to inform you on this period of Kansas' history with an unslanted view, then you are in for a swift and profound disappointment. Its ""both sides"" rhetoric provides the audience with nothing more than a hackneyed apologia for the erstwhile slaveholders and their present day sympathizers. Sure, the anti-slavery side in the Kansas conflict was not motivated by altruistic concerns, and this fact should be acknowledged and critically examined. However, to absolve the pro-slavery side's actions because their opponents were not saints is simply dishonest sophistry. There are aspects to condemn for people who wanted Kansas as a free state for their own economic interests, but let's not forget that one side supported holding human beings as property!",1509667200,4,868,5.251798561151079
8230341,4,B000XZGPKQ,"Bad Blood (along with August Light) are two excellent documentaries about generally less-well-known events that were part of our country's fighting over slavery, which reached its climax in the four gruesome years of our Civil War.

8230347,3,B000XZGPKQ,"The documentary is more balanced than some I've seen, and I think it was because those pursuing a Union interpretation of the Border War are now fearful to get too partisan in this area with our two books out recently. Director Pam Reichart even admitted she changed horses in midstream. I saw a lot of my pictures and some of my quotations used, and I wondered if this was coincidental or if they were borrowing from me and then not giving me any credit for it, which is what I assume they did.

The program starts out with the stilted declaration: ""The truth is here to be told,"" a promise that no one could live up to and talk about the Border War because, as you know and I know, there are two sides to the issue, and the Southern one is usually ignored.

They referred in the program, as part of their narration, about ""the radical theory of 'Popular Sovereignty.' "" This made me wonder: just who believed the theory of ""Popular Sovereignty"" was ""radical"" since it basically states that in deciding for or against slavery being included in a new state or territory, the popular vote, the democratic vote, should decide the issue. I didn't know that democracy was ""radical."" I wondered if this was a case of ""The truth is here to be told"" as they boasted at the outset of the program.

In one narration, while the speaker talked, you heard the cracks of whips in the background, or at least that's what it sounded to me like. So am I supposed to absorb the notion that in the background of these speakers voices are whips being laid on the back of black slaves?? Now, we are talking about ""The truth is here to be told,"" or is this an attempt to subcconsciously affect the listener without him even being aware of it?

Of course, as I expected, the Missouri elites and their colleagues, throughout the program, were described as ""Border Ruffans,"" a typical Unionist propaganda ploy, because this term was coined by master propagandist Horace Greeley in the nineteenth century, and this practice of using this propaganda term continued nonstop from start to finish. The documentary also maintained, without credible evidence, throughout the program, that abolionists outnumbered the proslavery people in Kansas during all periods. At the start, they admitted the proslavery people won the first territorial-wide election, but failed to say that they did so even excluding the illegal votes; then, afterward the narration began pushing the notion that the abolitionists were being cheated out of power in all of the elections, which they clearly weren't. My data, from Kansas State Historical Society publications proves that in 1855 and likely through 1857, the proslavery people clearly outnumbered the abolitionist voters in the territory.

Another questionable practice was using narrators during the program to promote abolitionist propaganda without telling us who was speaking and what ax they had to grind or whether they were even telling the truth. In fact, I was under the impression that it was the program's producers and directors speaking, promoting the abolitionist cause. So I think they were taking abolitionist examples and narrating them without telling who was saying what and making it appear that it was the director and her mouthpiece who were ""telling the truth is here to be told"" once again

The story of the abolitionists in the founding of Lawrence and their heavy-handed, armed intimidation of the proslavery people in the area is left untold. When James Lanes submitted a territorial constitution to the U.S. Congress and it is rejected, Producer Pam Reichart neglects to say through her narrator why it was rejected. That was because all the signatures were forged in one man's handwriting.

When Lawrence, Kansas, was sacked in 1856, Reichart tells through her narrator that Samuel Jones is present, gives him some bad press, but fails to say he was a Federally appointed sheriff of Douglas County and therefore anyone resisting him with arms was committing treason against the federal government who appointed him (although she uses ""treason"" in a heading). She fails, also, to mention that United States Marshall Israel Donalson is with Jones, demonstrating that the invasion is a Fedeally sponsored operation with the proper dignitaries present to enforce law and order in the name of the United States governement.

Reichart et al. downplay tremendously the actions of Montgomery in southeast Kansas in 1858-1861 when he continually raided across the border into Missouri, and when discussing John Brown's killing of the Doyles fails to mention that the reason he chose the Doyles was not an accident. Doyle and his sons carried warrants for Brown's arrest for recently intimidating a Supreme Court judge in the area, a Federal appointee. It is mentioned that John Brown leaves Kansas after the Pottawatomie Masscre, which, incidentally, is never called a massacre. The narration doesn't mention that he left because he was wanted for murder, and it doesn't say that he was harbored in the east by members of the Conspiracy of Six, who funded him, who were also committing treason, but says Brown went east to ""raise money."" The Conspiracy of Six also funded the attack on Harpers Ferry. Absolutely no mention is made of the large scale conspiracy to break John Brown out of jail by some twenty-two Kansas notables, a Who's Who in Kansas Abolitionism. This wasn't worth mentioning, no whips in the background.

My main complaint with the documentary is that 98 percent of it was a discussion of Territorial Kansas, as if telling that would be a history of the Border War, while at the same time ignoring the atrocities and carnage in Missouri in 1861-1865 when the entire border area was destroyed. You can't really write a comprehensive account of the Border War without writing about Territorial Kansas (1854-1861) and the Civil War in Missouri (1861-1865)at the same time. You have to combine the two for a history to make any sense. Maybe this will come later in another episode, but by excluding it in this documentary, it slanted the story immensely. Finally, it is clear there is no neat way to tell the story of the Border War or avoid the natural bias by partisans on both sides. You will notice that when marketing this documentary to schools in Kansas and Missouri, extra material from historians Nicole Etcheson, a professor ardently supportive of the abolitionists, will be added as well as that of a KU professor. Where's the balance there? I don't recognize it.",1327795200,9,6515,4.942465753424657
8230348,5,B000XZGPKQ,"I'm not a fan of Documentaries or Historical Fiction.  In particular, documentaries or books on the Civil War.  I find they are usually so biased, or so loosely based on 'history' as described by some politician or biased person I cannot usually watch or read the entire book or movie.  I was surprised to find Bad Blood is an excellent documentary.  The DVD cover indicates it was produced for Kansas Dept. of Tourism, and credits the Hartwig's for it's production.  When I read that, I expected a very 'biased' account of the now infamous border wars between Kansas and Missouri in the mid to late 1850's.  I was surprised.  Not only is the DVD careful to be for the most part extrememly correct historically, it also gives credit and blame evenly between Kansans, Missourians, politictians, 'Easterrn & Northern' influences (people).  I have literally hundreds of books and movies on the Civil war, and most I bought/own/keep because they cover aspects of Missouri's plight in that time.  The other reviewers are correct, that this DVD should be highly recommended for students or people interested in this portion of the 1800's and some of what the DVD seems to 'indicate' about John Brown, is at the very best, 'slanted'/distorted.  Not that I condone Brown's or many of the groups indicted in the DVD, I feel the director or producer could have been a little more careful in the depiciton/insinuation.  Having said that, the DVD does a great job pulling a lot of information together in an easily understood format for not only the knowledgable but the novice also.  They used actors in period dress to state what some of the 'player's said or wrote and that was a stroke of brilliance.  I'll not get in to the details, plot, or actions/activities shown because I hope based on the reviews you purchase or rent this DVD and see first hand for your self what the Kansas Missouri Border war really was, why it happened, what happened and how it was the prelude to the Civil War.  The picture quality and sound are well done and if it's 90 minutes long, I can tell you it's the fastest most interesting 90 minutes I've spent since I started studying Missouri and her role in the the Civil War.
Many books or movies return to a meaningless formula of 'here's what happened according to sources'.  Unfortunately the history of the civil war was 'created' primarily by the North and East (the 'winners') so the rule is 'don't always believe history is correct'.  Bad Blood delves into not only the historical facts, but in most cases explains why the events occurred.  It would have been easy to just fall back to labeling as many do, the 'jayhawkers', Missouri Ruffians, Bushwhackers, Guerrillas, raiders, etc. but instead these times are explained in context so a true picture of the Kansas Missouri border war is presented.  Bite the bullet and buy a copy, you'll find your self watching again and again as I have.",1291593600,17,2917,4.753968253968254
