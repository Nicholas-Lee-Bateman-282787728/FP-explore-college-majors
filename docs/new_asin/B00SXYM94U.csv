6994455,5,B00SXYM94U,"I'm a huge fan of The Walking Dead, and I think this movie brilliantly parodies a lot of ideas from the show. I enjoyed plenty of laughs from watching it, and would recommend it to anyone looking to check out a fun comedy!",1426982400,8,222,4.186046511627907

6994458,5,B00SXYM94U,"The most awesome spoof of Walking Dead and zombie movies I've ever seen.  The characterizations of the cast of The Walking Dead makes this movie a laugh and a half.

You don't have to watch The Walking Dead to enjoy it but it certainly does help. Also, knowing a little bit about Zombieland doesn't hurt either.

For pure plain fun this movie will get you going and going.  The laughs are there, that's for sure!",1453593600,3,412,4.453333333333333

6994463,2,B00SXYM94U,I actually got only like 45min into this movie before I turned it off. I'm not a fan of spoofs. Some are really funny though I will admit. But this one was beyond horrible. I couldn't stand losing anymore brain cells than I've already lost watching movies like Scream.,1447200000,,268,4.489795918367347
6994464,4,B00SXYM94U,it is a take off on the walking dead but also goes in its own way.  i did enjoy it for fun and like that they used a zombie as a main character and got into what he was thinking and wanting.,1447113600,2,190,3.5238095238095237

6994470,5,B00SXYM94U,"I've got to tell you, I'm tired of all the zombie stuff that is being put out today, but this movie was fantastic.  It is almost reminiscent of the original Scary Movie in that it doesn't just make random pop culture references but actually spoofs and parodies the source material.  Combining The Walking Dead, Zombieland, and Warm Bodies; this movie crafts a fun plot with great comedic timing and acting.  The throne in references to Shaun of the Dead and Dawn of the Dead with a splattering of other classic zombie movies makes this a great time for fans of zombies and is great for a laugh.",1444262400,2,594,4.5327102803738315

6994476,4,B00SXYM94U,"My wife and I watched this on Netflix expecting it to be terrible (it's rated only one star). We were very pleasantly surprised! For some reason this movie is unfairly getting a bad rap. This is actually a pretty good parody, primarily of The Walking Dead and Zombieland, with a little Warm Bodies thrown in for good measure. There's also references to Shaun of the Dead, Zombie Strippers, and Land of the Dead. Hard to say exactly why I dug the dark humor of this movie as much as I did... but I did!

Some of my favorite gags (SPOILERS AHEAD):

-Sheriff Lincoln always insists on referring to himself as ""Sheriff."" Not ""Deputy,"" not ""Deputy Sheriff."" This is hilarious to me because (a) a real Deputy Sheriff would never do this, and (b) Rick Grimes does the EXACT SAME THING on The Walking Dead!

-Sheriff Lincoln murdering that little girl because, ""that's just what a zombie would say."" lol

-Sheriff Lincoln continuing to gun down the zombies even after a cure has been found.

-Sheriff Lincoln always referring to his son Chris as ""Corl,"" because ""it's a coma thing.""

-Darnell insisting on using a child's toy crossbow as his weapon of choice. This is hilarious because, for the first three seasons of The Walking Dead, Daryl Dixon's crossbow was actually a youth bow (i.e. a bow designed for children to use)!

On the whole, I found this movie a lot of fun, very entertaining!",1437436800,5,1385,4.651639344262295
6994477,5,B00SXYM94U,"CARL!!!! A nice spoof on the TV show. Worth a watch. If you like this one try ""FDR American BadAss""",1436745600,,99,4.0
6994478,5,B00SXYM94U,"Funny ,well made sport movie full of stupid humor. A perfect movie for those I just need a laugh days",1436745600,,101,4.1
6994479,5,B00SXYM94U,Love parodies. At approx 39 min I was LMAF during the outside dinner scene then again at 54 min when they were running out of the barn to shoot off fireworks while under the influence. Watch bloopers during the end credits for extra laughs.,1436054400,,240,4.4772727272727275
6994480,3,B00SXYM94U,"it's worth a watch, pretty entertaining actually.  better than I expected.",1435017600,,74,5.7272727272727275
6994481,5,B00SXYM94U,Campy and right on the money with this Zombie craze.  When will they kill all of the zombies so we can move on?,1434499200,,111,3.8260869565217392

6994484,5,B00SXYM94U,Love The Walking Dead and all the Romero movie classics.  This was hilarious I love the zombie genre and this poked at most of them I really enjoyed this,1433376000,,153,4.275862068965517
6994485,2,B00SXYM94U,As with any make fun movie not the best actors.,1433376000,,47,3.8
6994486,2,B00SXYM94U,So best part was the bloopers during the credits. A few funny punchlines in the movie. Chuckled a few times but overall kinda tired humor. Wait for cable.,1433203200,,154,4.535714285714286
6994487,1,B00SXYM94U,Wish I could give it 0 stars. What a waste,1432944000,,42,3.3
6994488,3,B00SXYM94U,Funny ish.. Worth the rent for a mindless evening,1432598400,,49,4.555555555555555
6994489,4,B00SXYM94U,"Much better than i thought it would be. Thought it'd be nothing but slapstick and fart jokes like most spoofs. It was actually pretty funny. Don't get me wrong it's silly, but not a bad way to kill and hour and a half.",1432598400,,218,4.093023255813954
6994490,3,B00SXYM94U,"I am not a fan of spoof movies but I am a zombie and Walking Dead fan so I had to watch this. Huge disappointment! Could have been so much better and had way more potential for it to be a decent comedy. Terrible script. Horrible storyline. Awful actors. I only gave it 3 stars because of the ongoing ""Carl"" joke throughout the movie and the occasional zombie humor which was the only thing that saved it from being a total waste of time.",1432080000,,437,4.214285714285714
6994491,4,B00SXYM94U,"I got such a kick out of quite a bit of this. I don't watch ""Walking Dead"" but do watch a lot of zombie movies. This one spoofs them all from ""The Walking Dead"" to ""Warm Bodies"" etc. Part of the fun for me was that the cast looked to be having such a great time. There were enough good solid laughs to keep me interested and then enough good smile jokes to do the same. Don't try to over examine it, enjoy and just roll with it.",1431993600,9,428,3.875
6994492,2,B00SXYM94U,It is much funnier if you follow THE WALKING DEAD!,1431907200,,50,4.1

6994494,5,B00SXYM94U,"A zombie breakout is caused by a restaurant employee not washing his hands while preparing sushi for the homeless. The film is a spoof of various zombie films, including ""Zombieland,"" ""Warm Bodies,"" ""Walking Dead""  ""Zombie Strippers""and a couple of Romero's films. The first person narrative is supplied by a zombie (Troy Ogletree) whose name is Romeo (""Warm Bodies"" Romeo/Juliet  spoof where ""R"" was the zombie)  and he is often called Romero. A group of them are held up at the mall and opt to go to a Safe Haven Farm, where they believe their hosts are cannibals. Some members take on names of cities like they did in ""Zombieland"". A  zombie performs the narration as opposed to a non-zombie and the two girls are sisters.

Andrew Lincoln plays Deputy Grimes in ""The Walking Dead"" hence Deputy Sheriff Lincoln (Dave Sheridan).. His 12 year old son (Mason Dakota Galyon) has great lines and steals every scene he is in. As the owner/manager of a strip joint the kid was a hoot. I had to laugh. The film also makes pop culture references from the 60's and present. Takes swipes at Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez.

The film is similar to the ""Scary Movie"" genre but the spoofs are not as pronounced. Includes outtakes and deleted scenes.

Guide: F-bomb. Nudity. Blood splatter on camera lens.",1431302400,12,1290,4.757847533632287
6994495,1,B00SXYM94U,"I bothered to include this film in my Netflix DVD queue despite the majority of bad reviews here because I sometimes find humor in things others don't and sometimes bad movies are so bad that they're funny. Unfortunately, that was not the case in this instance.

My viewing of this film progressed as follows: for about 30 minutes I actually watched it, laughing ONCE at the sheriff's call for Corrrraaal - for another 24 minutes I had it on in the background as I did other things  then DVD eject and back in the Netflix mailer. This is probably the most unfunny comedy I've ever seen.

It is absolutely amazing to me that with such an incredibly rich field of material to choose from to parody from the many seasons of the outstanding Walking Dead and the many zombie films the result was such an absolutely horrible script. I beg the completely talent-free hack(s) who wrote this unfunny garbage from such a wealth of potential material to please make this a better world and never write a movie script of any kind again. No TV scripts either. Consider a career in fast food.

I give this film one star because the camera work and lighting was actually decent as was SOME of the acting... and because I can't give it zero stars.",1430956800,,1231,4.531531531531532
6994496,3,B00SXYM94U,"This is better than I expected, of course the bar has been set sooo low recently by parody movies...this one clears the hurdle by allowing time for the jokes to breath and not going for extreme shock laughs.",1430870400,,207,4.473684210526316
6994497,1,B00SXYM94U,"I'm a huge fan of the Walking Dead and I've read the comics, the novels and I've played the games and I watch the show, so when I saw this spoof movie, I just had to pick it up!  However it wasn't what I was hoping for.

This movie is just not something that die hard fans of the Walking Dead will enjoy.  It makes Daryl Dixon look like a complete joke of a man who walks around playing with a toy all the time.  There is one joke in the movie about the main character constantly getting his kid's name wrong, and it's funny for like a second and then it's just lame and repetitive.

Look, if you like the show, this is a movie you probably won't like.",1430092800,,652,3.9846153846153847
6994498,1,B00SXYM94U,"This movie isn't even funny just sad and tired! I could see where they could of done something awesome but instead the jokes are forced and run into the ground and after paying money for it powered through to see the end, which is the best and only good part! Do not buy this RENT if you just have to know but for GODS sake don't spend money on this movie!",1429747200,,356,4.028169014084507
6994499,1,B00SXYM94U,"They fooled me. No captioning. I bought this because I'm a huge fan of the The Walking Dead and like always (being deaf) I check to make sure it has closed captioning and the cover said it does ""CC"". So I bought it and brought it home to watch. Of course, to my frustration, there's NO captioning or subtitles at all. Why would they lie and put ""CC"" on the box and not included closed captioning?

6994501,5,B00SXYM94U,I love the humor. The fact that it doesn't rely completely on blood and gore and used some real writing is a credit to the movie and makes it more than a cut above the majority of the zombie parody or non-parody.,1429401600,,212,4.071428571428571

6994505,5,B00SXYM94U,"This was pretty funny in areas lol. I wasn't looking for a comedy or parody movie, but I'm glad I ran across it. I'll give it five stars just for the sheriff's comments!",1429142400,,169,4.151515151515151

6994507,4,B00SXYM94U,"I had almost given up on parody films due to the large amount of bad ones that have came out the past decade or so.  One of the main reasons is because so many of these types of films cram in as many jokes as possible, hoping 1 out of 100 will be funny.  This is why I truly enjoyed this film so much, it wasn't bashing my brains out with a million lame jokes and overwhelming me with a desperate attempt at humor.  This film gave the audience time to enjoy each attempt to be funny and allow us to stay in the scene a while to decide for ourselves.  They parodied a few different films but didn't try to overdo it, which is a nice thing to see.

The ending was really fun as well, but I don't want to spoil it so I'll make this short and sweet.  We need more better quality parodies like this one, and I will happily purchase this to watch again when it's released to buy on amazon.",1429056000,2,883,3.9886363636363638
