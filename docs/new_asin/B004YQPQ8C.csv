It doesn't seem to be as well known in the US as his samurai trilogy, and a quick search turns up a scathing review by Screen Daily, in which it was called ""insipid"" and accused of ""shamelessly tear-jerking."" I found myself wondering if I had seen the same movie as the reviewer, because I thought Yoji Yamada's portrayal of a long-suffering sister and her exasperating, socially inept brother to be incredibly touching.

The film mostly unfolds through the perspective of Koharu, the daughter of a widowed pharmacist in a placid corner of Tokyo. Over the years we witness some vignettes of Koharu's interactions with her uncle, who never fails to cause familial havoc. Though others look on him with disdain, his sister, Ginko, is able to summon compassion for him from a mostly endless reservoir. At one point, uncle Tetsuro ruins his niece's wedding by getting drunk, giving awkward toasts, and bursting into song (he's a former actor), creating embarrassment for all, but mostly his relatives. Later in the film, and less humorously, we find Ginko being forced to use her savings to repay his sizable debts. One expects initially that Tetsuro may be the kind of lovable ne'er-do-well who conceals a wonderful sense of humor or valuable selflessness beneath his alcoholic exterior. However, he's mostly a very lonely person who takes advantage of the kindness of others, even if, at his deepest, he cares for his family members quite a bit.

Despite the emotional ups and downs, like his other films, Yamada permeates the atmosphere of About Her Brother with calmness. The interior scenes often reminded me of Ozu and I really had the sense of spending a couple hours in Koharu and Ginko's house. It has a way of feeling very much like the slow unwinding of normal life, even though its narrative may sound like the stuff of melodrama. Watching the progression of Tetsuro and his sister's relationship - and feeling her love for him, despite the fact that he was unloved by everyone else and deemed a nuisance to society - is powerful, and the film stayed with me for quite a few days afterwards.",1423267200,,2231,4.807291666666667
