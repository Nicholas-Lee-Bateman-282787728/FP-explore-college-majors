8605195,3,B00005TQ4V,"A fairly slow King of the Cage.  The Heavyweight Tournament is good, except the final match is given away on the cover of the box so you know who makes the finals.  Some big names in single fights.  Muay Thai expert Duane Ludwig.  UFC vetern Chris Brennan.  And rising lightweight star Javier Vazques.  A couple decision and some weak submissions.  And no real good knockouts or anything.
A fairly good King of the Cage, but not the best by any means.",1019433600,2,451,4.493827160493828
