8194712,4,B000Q6RGUA,"Frankly, I don't understand the ""warning"" from some reviewers that this is not the American release.  Noting that is fine, but where is the ""warning"" (as if a fast one were being pulled on a gullible public)?  Mario Bava was Italian, and his movie is in Italian.  AIP, who released the American version, wasn't known as a quality company, but if you prefer the original dubbed into English, it's fine.  It's not ""superior"", just fine.

The original version is what is offered here, and it is only fitting considering it was released as part of The Mario Bava Collection  box set from Anchor Bay.

This is not my favorite Bava film - I personally find Black Sunday, Kill, Baby, Kill, and Blood and Black Lace better movies - but I do still like it.  European directors in general, and Mario Bava in particular, understood that horror was as much or more the creation of mood as the depiction of horrific action. Modern horror films are more graphically violent, but less likely to create and explore mood as a sustaining thematic horror device.  Some of the best modern horror films do, but generally they do not.  It's from masters like Bava that we learn what can be done with this dimension.",1358640000,,1193,4.6380952380952385
8194713,5,B000Q6RGUA,"This is the first scary movie I watched in a theater, I was 8 years old. I still have nightmares to this day about this movie. Second to the Exorcist, this is th most Scariest Movie I've ever watched!",1324339200,,200,4.153846153846154
8194714,3,B000Q6RGUA,"Mario Bava's entry in the Cormanesque compilation horror stakes, The Three Faces of Fear aka Black Sabbath suffers the format's common problem - the variable quality of the individual stories. In this case, in the Italian cut at least, that's somewhat exacerbated by having the best of the three in the middle of the picture, leaving it somewhat anticlimactic. The stories' heritage isn't in doubt, based on stories by Chekhov, Tolstoy and Maupassant, but neither opener The Telephone, about a woman harassed by phone calls that may be from the lover she betrayed to the police, or A Drop of Water, about a nurse who finds herself terrorized by her imagination after stealing a ring from a dead woman she laid out, offer much in the way of surprise or chills. Neither, it's true, does the central and longest story, The Wurdalak, yet that tale of a family gradually picked off by vampires cursed to drink the blood of those they love most in the world is executed with enough panache, striking visuals and unexpected nastiness (a child is the first to die) to keep you intrigued even though you know exactly where it's going. A dubbed Boris Karloff provides the star power for this sequence as well as the introduction and epilogue, which features an initially inept shot that turns into a truly delightful in-joke by the time the end credit is ready to appear (the new intros he filmed for the US version of the film are not included on Anchor Bay's DVD of the original Italian version, although they can be glimpsed in the disc's US trailer, part of an actionably misleading US advertising campaign that included a poster of a headless horseman that doesn't appear in either version of the film!).",1287532800,,1699,4.762711864406779
8194715,3,B000Q6RGUA,"Good music and storytelling, a must see for movie fans. This is the Italian movie Three Faces of Evil, not the North American released movie.
If you're looking for the North American movie with Boris Karloff featured also featured as the narrator, it is sold in a double pack of B is for Blood with these movies Queen of Blood/Black Sabbath.",1273708800,8,341,4.60655737704918
8194716,3,B000Q6RGUA,"Buyers be forewarned.  Unlike the ""also from"" Anchor Bay trailers showing the American AIP version of ""Black Sabbath"", what is on the disc is NOT that version.  Instead this is the European Italian language version with subtitles and even Karloff's voice is dubbed in Italian.  Their advertising is very misleading for the unaware.",1193788800,16,331,5.2075471698113205
