875520,4,6304438206,"I liked the car chase and the shootouts, it reminded me of a john woo film. Then, towards the middle of the film i relized there wasn't much fighting. the ending is really cool! Very cool movie.",958176000,,194,4.27027027027027
875521,3,6304438206,"This is one of Jackie's ""acting"" movies. I think that Jackie can act but I want to see more fights and stunts from him. This one does have a good plot. I did keep watching but I wouldn't want anyone to watch unless  they were fans like I am.",946684800,,241,3.9183673469387754
875522,4,6304438206,"This is one movie that proves that Jackie Chan is actually a good actor and not just your run-of-the-mill action star. It shows a serious side to Jackie which is really good. Great action scenes and good fight scenes even  though they are not like his other fight scenes, having ten thousand hits a  second. I would recommend this to anyone.",936748800,,341,4.573770491803279
875523,5,6304438206,"""Crime Story"" represents Chan's only ""serious"" film since 1989's delightful ""Mr. Canton and Lady Rose"" (aka ""Miracles"").  Unlike ""Mr. Canton and Lady Rose,""  ""Crime Story"" is very dark: dark themes, dark lighting, and dark  locations. ""Crime Story"" enables Chan to demonstrate his  considerable acting ability and range.  ""Crime Story"" tells the  story of police corruption, betrayal, and the ubiquitous presence of the  triads.  The movie also includes some of the best action sequences filmed  in the 1990s.  I have seen most of Chan's films in their original form, but  not ""Crime Story"" (aka ""Police Story IV"").  The  American edition of ""Crime Story"" appears to suffer from  extensive editing.  For example, the female psychiatrist plays a vital role  in the first fifteen minutes of the film, yet disappears for the remaining  hour and a half.  This does not effect the overall entertainment value of  the movie.  Many fans complain about the complete absence of comedy in this  film.  However, I have seen over forty of Chan's films, and the change  afforded by ""Crime Story"" was welcome.",926294400,6,1095,5.131428571428572
875524,2,6304438206,"Even though I really like all of the other Chan movies that I have seen this was a severe disappointment compared to his other films.  There was almost none of Jackie's great comic fighting, making this movie like all of  the other cop movies out there, minimal plot and boring action.",913507200,,285,4.568627450980392
875576,2,6304438206,This was not my favorite Jackie Chan movie at all. It was OK but I found it kinda hard to follow and it really didn't keep my interest. I wouldn't recommend it. Never saw it before and probably not going to watch it again.,1334707200,,222,4.068181818181818
875577,3,6304438206,"A typical Jackie Chan police style movie with all of the Chinese opera style of kung fu and acrobatics and action anyone might want.  All goes well in the movie until the end (spoiler alert!) when we see the kidnap vicitim, a rich industrialist/manufacture, tied to an anchor and thrown over board with virtually no chance of being rescued and then, in the next scene, he is alive and well, with the police and his wife, planning on leaving the country...?, with no explanation...?",1280102400,,481,4.726190476190476
875578,5,6304438206,"The movie is kinda like Jackie Chan's police story but doesn't focus on him as the only main character giving the movie a more traditional realistic feel but still keeping all the things that makes Chan's older movies great. The other thing that makes this movie a little odd is that it's based on a true story meaning Jackie isn't as Immortal as he kinda is in his other moves.
All in all it's just like any other Jackie Chan movie so what more could you ask for?",1278979200,,464,4.284090909090909
875579,5,6304438206,I received the movie very fast.  Like 4 or 5 days after I order it.  That makes me happy.,1234396800,,89,3.6315789473684212
875580,5,6304438206,"Crime Story tends  to be  overshadowed by the Police Story films, but it's  a  very different  animal: while it may  share  a  few  familiar  faces,  it's a straight-up  thriller  without  the need for much  comic  relief and with  a strong  dramatic  turn from Chan. Focussing on  a  kidnapping carried out  by corrupt cops  who figure they  can keep the investigation off track, it's not short on action, but  like  the similarly  comparatively  lesser know Thunderbolt this time the  violence  is played rather  more  for  real - when the punches land, they  hurt. It's a shame  Chan  never  followed it up with  more dramatic roles, but  it certainly stands up as one  of his most memorable pictures.",1232236800,,704,4.732758620689655
875581,2,6304438206,"Filmed in 1993, this film is based on a true story. It is not a comedy, as you'd expect from Chan, instead it is a very serious story relying more on acting than action. I am a huge fan of Jackie's, but this movie is one of my least favorite. Jackie does not even crack a smile in this movie. It is worth having if you are a huge fan, but I guarantee it won't be one you watch again and again.",1230422400,,393,3.8048780487804876
875582,5,6304438206,"This is quite possibly one of Jackie's best films.  It lacks the slapstick humor so many American audiences are accustomed to, but you actually get to see Jackie ACT!  This is the way he should have been been introduced to America.  A great film to see and share.",1224892800,,263,4.4375
875583,5,6304438206,"It's Jackie's most rare movie, it is very graphic, realistic feel to it about a hard life of honest cops. This is not a martial arts flick, although it has that, it is much more, a real detraction from Jacky Chan's usual funny style. It's not a comedy. It is a suspense detective. Enjoy one of Jacky's rarest, but wonderfully made movies.",1214265600,,338,4.467741935483871
875584,5,6304438206,"An excellent well put together package.  The special collector's edition of Jackie Chan's classic 1993 Crime Story.  With added special features including Deleted Scenes (3), Feature Commentary with Director Kirk Wong and Hong Kong Cinema Expert Bey Logan, A Journey to the Underworld: An Exclusive Interview with Director Kirk Wong, From The Page to the Silver Screen: An Interview with Writer Teddy Chen and Trailer Gallery.

If you already have the first edition of this great movie.  I would still invest the collectors edition as it brings more action, suspense and intrigue.  Jackie Chan plays a cop that is witness to a kidnapping of a prominient businessman and his wife.  The wife is forced into giving the kidnappers almost 60 million dollars.  As the movie progresses Jackie runs into all kinds of people out to kill him for what he knows and a secret or two buried right in his own office.  The movie is fast paced and full of classic Jackie battles.  Crime Story won't be one of those movies that disappoint either as it still holds up despite all the time that has passed.",1209686400,,1086,4.795698924731183
875585,3,6304438206,"Supposedly based on true events, Crime Story puts Jackie Chan in his usual hero cop role against a group of criminals and their kidnapping scheme.  Unlike his Police Story movies, this film plays it straight with an emphasis on realism and drama over martial arts and stunts.  Missing here are any of Jackies usual over the top antics and absolutely none of his humor or charm.  It's interesting to see Jackie play this stiff of a role and he does a fine job but I'm not sure why you would ever cast him to be this bland.  I guess they wanted to differentiate this from the Police Story films (he goes by Eddie Chan here rather than his real name like in Police Story 1 & 2)but I for one yearned for those pictures while watching this (in fact it forced me to rethink my original rating on Police Story 2 to 4 stars instead of 3).  This is still worth catching once at least... and who knows, maybe I'm missing something that the other reviewers are seeing?  If you always wanted to see what Chan's career would have been like if he wasn't one of the greatest martial artists ever this is for you... for those who watch Chan movies for unique fights and exhilerating stunts you'll have to go elsewhere.  No matter your feelings on the film Dragon Dynasty has released it in usual top notch form here.",1189728000,,1300,4.391666666666667

875617,1,6304438206,"BEWARE.  This DVD will ONLY play on a DVD player made for SE Asia (region 3), so why is it being sold on the USA website?",1161907200,,121,3.6538461538461537
875618,3,6304438206,"IN ONE OF HIS MORE SERIOUS OUTINGS, JACKIE CHAN PLAYS A COP WHO'S LOOKING TO SOLVE THE CASE OF A KIDNAPPING THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING MASTERMINDED BY THE COP HE'S ASSIGNED TO BE PARTNERED WITH. THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH MARTIAL ARTS HERE, BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTION AND IT'S A GOOD STORY. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF JACKIE'S MARTIAL ARTS-COMEDIES, YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA WATCH THIS FILM. BUT IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE ''DIRTY HARRY''-STYLE COP FILMS, THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. BASED ON REAL-LIFE EVENTS.",1121472000,,480,4.528735632183908
875619,5,6304438206,"No, this isn't one of Jackie's light-humored romps, so don't even bother with this movie if that's all for which you're looking. This movie shows Jackie's acting ability... he can be dramatic and serious, not just a loveable clown. There are many comedies you can choose from in his long list of movies; there are fewer when you try to find a broader range of his impressive acting abilities which is wider in scope than many might expect. As other reviewers have covered the story itself, I'm just going to add a few words here. Now, Jackie took this part because Jet Li walked out on it and Jackie happened to walk into the director's office right after this happened. So, being a pal, he offered himself in Jet's place. Or so I understand the history behind it. Don't let the fact that is in not a comedic venture steer you from this gem of a movie; it is a fantastic piece filled with drama and action. We still get to see Jackie's trademark and inimitable body work in this film. It is a GOOD movie. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. And if you like his dramatic acting, check out Thunderbolt (awesome) and Heart of Dragon (very good and touching). Yes, folks, Jackie is a REAL actor, he has depth and scope, he is dynamic. Don't make the mistake of pidgeon-holing him into one static dimension. It'll be your loss.",1085011200,2,1328,4.469135802469136
875620,5,6304438206,"This film has NO comedy in it. Infact it isn't known to be a usual comedy/action but a crime/thriller/action. This movie is based on a true story. Jackie plays a cop whose emoptional state is shaken by  a recent bloddy encounter with terrorists. When Jackie's assigned to bring back the kidnapped businessman, it's a test of Jackie's emotional stability and Jackie's skills as an officer.",1037059200,2,388,4.969230769230769
875621,2,6304438206,"This movie doesn't really star Jackie Chan.  He is only shoved in in an unrelated clip so as to fool people into buying it.  Otherwise, it is only marginably entertaining.",1029110400,,171,4.666666666666667
875622,4,6304438206,"In Crime Story, Jackie Chan does drama, and he does it well.  The year before (1985), Jackie had been involved in another police drama, a terrible film called The Protector.  Although Jackie was the protagonist in The Protector, he was not a likeable character.  In fact, there were no likeable characters.  In addition, the action sequences, which could have been good, were poorly filmed and much of the visual impact was lost due to poor camera work.
In Crime Story, Jackie seems to be out to prove he can do a gritty drama properly.  Although his character isn't a goofy, affable fellow, he is certainly likeable.  He plays a police officer on the verge of a nervous breakdown, after he killed some criminals in the line of duty.
He's hired on for a high-profile case when a construction magnate is kidnapped.  Jackie's tension and anguish grows more and more, as other police officers are killed or seriously injured during the course of the case.  These scenes show Jackie is capable of more than just goofy gurning, and I understand why this film garnered Jackie the Golden Horse Best Actor Award from Taiwan.
The camera work is vastly superior to that of The Protector, and tense fight scenes upon a derelict ship and inside a burning building (the latter scene bore a heavy influence upon John Woo's Hard Boiled) work very well.
All in all, the story makes sense, except for a ridiculous part in which the bad guys resuscitate a woman with their car's jumper cables.  I once saw a really bad vampire movie where this trick worked, but something tells me it just shouldn't be used in serious films, at least, not the way it was used in Crime Story.
If you like to watch Jackie Chan for his comedy, skip Crime Story.  He only slips into comic relief mode a couple of times in this film.  However, if you would like to see a decent cops n' robbers flick, check this out.",1010880000,9,1876,4.586826347305389
875623,4,6304438206,"I will admit, I watch Jackie Chan movies for two (plus one) reasons, and I am almost entirely watching them one by one at the times.  What do I mean by that?  The three reasons I watch Jackie Chan is: the charm of his character, the slapstick, and the incredible martial arts; for my previous statement, let us simply focus on the slapstick and martial arts.  What I meant by my earlier statement was that when I watch the fight scenes, I commonly watch them over because the first time I was too busy admiring his moves and laughing at the slapstick to care about the content of the fight in itself.  The second time I watch it, it's to pretend I'm Jackie, and the people I don't like are the baddies who're getting beaten up.
This movie takes care of the first viewings for me in the most effective way possible: making it for the most part nonexistant.  While laughing at Drunken Master II, all I can do ussually is feel it being a good thing to see many evil men having their faces smashed and bodies tumbled upon each other; they are built up in which their characters deserve nothing better!  Crime Story fits in that category, and while satisfying, it is far inferior to Drunken Master II in that respect.
How is Crime Story a movie that in some ways works and some ways doesn't?  The reason it works is that it tells a very gritty crime story (no stupid remark intended) extreamly well.  Director Kirk Wong clearly knows his stuff, and if you are unsure throughout the movie as you watch it, wait and watch closely the scene in which Jackie Chan and Detective Hung lead a search on the criminals' ship outside of the city.  The lighting and wind and water-dripping effects are used to incredible effects.  However, the reasons why these didn't quite work was the lack of satisfaction by which these despicable villains were taken out.  The sickest one who hit Jackie with a few solid hits ran off, and Jackie shot him a couple of times later.
The only thing I could think of to say was: ""Hey, that's It?!""  Police Stories 1 & 2 were less gritty, yet the enemies were ussually taken out in an incredibly satisfying way.  One of the big villains in Police Story 2 (which for SOME REASON isn't out on DVD yet!!!) was picked up by Jackie Chan on the second floor of a warehouse, and thrown out the window, where he slid down a giant sign made up of many neon lights.  Now THAT is a satisfying way to take out a villain!  Shooting him and him quickly dying is just too weak, I'm sorry.
Maybe I didn't talk about the movie and break it down enough in my long review, but I do personally believe that my main point is enough to stress everything that should decide wheather you'd love or hate this movie.  While I liked it, it was like a different part of my mind liking it, which wasn't necessarily a good thing.  However, I still enjoyed the movie immensely, as it showed a more mature and darker side of Jackie Chan, as well as a more acting side as well.",1005177600,2,2959,4.360655737704918
875624,5,6304438206,"I have only seen the VHS version (with subtitles) but this story is very good, serious drama from Jackie Chan.  If you only like him for crazy kung fu and comedy, then don't see this movie.  Very little of either.  Jackie gives an excellent performance for which he won the Golden Horse Best Actor Award from Taiwan.  He plays a police officer almost on the verge of a nervous breakdown, who is obsessed with finding a kidnap victim before he is killed.  His efforts are hampered by his partner, who has actually arranged the kidnapping!  The ending in the burning building is great.  I cannot recommend actually buying this DVD, as I am not sure if any scenes have been cut from this DVD release, which usually happens with USA releases.  The 5 stars are for the story and for Jackie's acting.",989712000,,794,4.542253521126761
7871014,5,6304438206,"This is one of Jackie Chan's most brutal and serious martial arts films, but, although it lacks the humor we've come to expect from Jackie's films, my wife and I really enjoyed it.

The text at the end seems to indicate that it's based loosely on a true kidnapping story, and dedicates the film to the police who risk and/or sacrifice their lives rescuing the numerous kidnapping victims in the Hong Kong area.

Perhaps the funniest thing in this film was the public sex scene involving an obese policeman and his girl friend in a mall.

The worst thing about this film is the English dubbing, so you're not listening to Jackie's voice.",1469577600,,636,4.610619469026549
