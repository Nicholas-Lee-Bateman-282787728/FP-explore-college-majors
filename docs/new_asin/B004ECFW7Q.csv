4336386,5,B004ECFW7Q,"I thoroughly enjoyed this performance and appreciated all of it's theatricality. The magnificent costumes ( even Kate Pinkerton is a standout ) and the stylized images bring the viewer into the story.
Patricia Racette is a thrilling actress and her attention to the text is especially commendable.  Although she may not have a super-star voice she does have everything necessary to fill the role and makes a thrilling performance.
I understand now why people call Marcello Giordano 'uneven'. He is mostly a thrilling vocalist but sometimes slips off the voice a little here and there. His support isn't as reliable and we've been horribly spoiled by Domingo for decades now.
Zifchak and Croft are both involved in the drama 100% and sing beautifully.  It's tragic that this was Anthony Minghella's only opera production.  I'm certain I own all the Butterfly's currently out and with just a fond glance at the Ponelle film with Freni & Karajan I reccommend this Met performance as the best of the bunch.",1296259200,10,1002,4.9880239520958085
4336387,5,B004ECFW7Q,"This is one of those opera videos that works on all levels, and because it is very hard to achieve that with this particular opera, and also because this is a very touching piece when delivered well as it is here, I highly recommend the video.

Butterfly is supposed to be small but her voice must be largish, so it's always a bit of a trick to get this opera to both look and sound right. Patricia Racette is wonderful as Butterfly.  Her voice is easy to hear with a nice squillo - she never sounds pushed or fatigued all the way to the end.  She is strong throughout all her registers.  She looks small enough and her costumes help in adding a small look to her.  The Suzuki, Maria Zifchak, is wonderful.  Giordani as Pinkerton is in good voice, and he strikes a very handsome officer.  Croft is in good enough voice to execute Sharpless without problem.

The puppets are wonderful.  You generally have a real little boy playing the child and he's usually a bit out of place because there is quite a bit of stage-time but nothing for him to do as he is never a trained actor.  But these skilled puppeteers have the little boy moving about displaying emotions by the movement of the puppet's body that is completely enchanting, and the child's emotions add rather than detract from the drama.

The second puppet is a representation of Butterfly dancing with a real human dancer representing Pinkerton in a short ballet.  (Yes, the puppets are so charming, they can make a ballet in an opera seem too short. Hopefully, the 'Butterfly' puppet will get larger roles as her career blossoms. ;0) )

The sets are nice and so are the costumes.  Butterfly and Pinkerton could not be made to look better.  The costumes completely compliment all the main singers.  It's just a great show, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.",1296086400,14,1818,4.513761467889908
4336388,5,B004ECFW7Q,"When I first read about Minghella's production I had serious doubts, but everyone I knew (well, almost) who saw it in London, then here, had nothing but raves. I still had doubts going in, but was instantly won over by every element of it.  The lighting, costumes, unit set and the never less than startling use of color is breathtaking.

Racette's Butterfly is one of the finest I've encountered and here she is positively shattering.  (Special kudos go to her for rescuing this performance at the last minute, coming in from Washington, DC where she was in final rehearsals for ""Peter Grimes."")  Yes, she can flat a little, or start a note less than dead center of pitch, but in this performance there is almost none of that.  Several moments are, in fact, so vocally perfect I find myself completely overwhelmed; most notably ""Che tua madre"" and the end of her great narration before the Cherry Blossom duet. In the latter Racette holds the final note for near eternity, the voice growing in a crescendo that nearly covered the orchestra (I've never heard this from her before) and as she let go of the note, she collapsed, fainting to the floor (in an earlier performance,  the house erupted into a huge ovation).

Giordani is having a good day, as well, and always believable as Pinkerton.  In Minghella's stunning setting he and Racette exploit two violently clashing cultures: Butterfly all delicate movement, darting and hiding all over the stage - behind lanterns, in the shadows, etc. creating a shy, excitable child while Pinkerton, barely controlling his passion, hunted her, grabbing her passionately as she jumps into his arms, then catching and holding her aloft, removing her outer garments, etc.  Two vastly different worlds colliding and trapped perfectly in Puccini's inescapable web.  If there is a more erotically charged romantic duet in all of opera than Butterfly & Pinkerton's, I don't know it

The Puppet Sorrow.  I'd adopt him if I could (but would go broke trying to feed and clothe his handlers!)  Racette's interactions with him were infinitely more touching than I've seen with any ""real"" child, lending a certain heightened hyper-realism I've not experienced before.  (During intermission Racette, (unaware the camera was on her)  prepares for the final act, climbing down onto the floor and addressing him ""Okay, Baby . . . sleepytime, baby!"" as she placed his head onto her lap positioning herself for curtain's rise.  (At the HD presentation the entire theatre cracked up here and earlier when Giordani carried her offstage, Racette finally breaking character chortled ""Thanks for carrying me ass first towards the camera, Marcello!"")

Racette is a throwback to the style of singing of generations ago, singers willing to cross the line and ""become"" the character, using ""old school diva tricks"" like whispering, muttering, crying, giggling, groaning - all manner of ""extramusical"" devices which were pretty much all but  eliminated from opera since the late 70's.

Dwyane Croft has grown to become perhaps the finest Sharpless in my experience.  Gorgeous of voice, and offering a richly nuanced portrayal, evoking a worldly, but sympathetic masculinity while remaining impotent - an outsider who understands but is unable to prevent the tragedy he finds himself a part of.

Even the way the bows are presented is theatrical, and when the stage is bare, Cio Cio San appears at the top of the set an absolute ROAR went up from the house - and as she slowly made her way down to the footlights almost the entire house stood cheering. Breathtaking moment and Racette was visibly moved by the response.

This is a unique and special Butterfly and I'm thrilled to see it being released on DVD where it should do well.",1294790400,60,3747,4.980738362760834
4336389,4,B004ECFW7Q,"Anthony Minghella's new staging of Madama Butterfly is a fascinating mix of traditional theater from both Europe and Japan. This new production seems to have finally been released on DVD due to its online popularity and requests. This is the third production of a Madama Butterfly I've seen (I'm still pretty new to opera), and currently stands at my favorite.

The role of Butterfly is rather infamous; it's one of the most difficult roles both on a physical and psychological level (even the great Leontyne Price said she found the tragic role almost too painful to continue). The physical element requires a much more mature voice and powerful voice, thus nearly all people who play the role will have to be older than a 16-year-old girl. Racette may not be 16, but her body language, costume and makeup certainly make her look young, naive, and innocent. Though she doesn't look Japanese, this is definitely not the first opera I've seen in which a particular ethnicity is not matched by the performer (others include Otello, Turandot, or Atilla). Turn on the suspension of disbelief.

Her acting, body language and emotion were all there, but as another reviewer pointed out, her voice was not entirely there. As she went higher, her vibrato got too wide and even wobbly to the point that the center note was not as distinguishable. I found Act I to be the best part while Act II (sadly including Un bel di) to be the most wobbly and thin. Though it was a bit of a let-down, I was still fully immersed in the story and could see (and hear as the case may be) past the issues. Act III improved from Act II, though yes still the top notes wobbled. All in all though, I cannot say I was disappointed; it still shook me up.

Marcello Giordani's Pinkerton had a different sound and interpretation as others before him. It appears his Pinkerton is not necessarily cold or evil, but rather he's totally ignorant of exactly how terrible a thing he's doing. Giordani's interpretation has Pinkerton entering as a man filled with pride, thinking his culture is simply better while taking advantage of another culture guilt-free. He only suddenly feels guilt when he realizes he has his son, in which case he almost goes in for self-pity. Having interacted with people with similar vain self-pity issue, I found this interpretation very believable. It's different, but still a psychologically fascinating and realistic approach. Like Racette, his upper register was a disappointment. His voice was full, but the sound itself didn't seem to match his current emotion; the first act he sounded tragic too soon, which made his guilt and self-pity in Act III a little less powerful. Still, his acting and performance was enough to make him believable and conniving as any Pinkerton.

Dwayne Croft's Sharpless was probably the best I've seen and heard. Voice, face, emotion, acting, all of it was there. He's the only voice of reason, and he really shows his character as feeling a deep guilt for not speaking up or doing more to prevent the tragedy from happening. Maria Zifchak's Suzuki was the only real let-down for me. I don't know enough of her singing to know whether this is normal or just a bad day, but her voice seemed to have a lot of problems centering on a note. Though her character is a pessimist, I found her acting a little over-the-top and hard to believe. Still, her character still provides a good contrast to the naivety of Butterfly which Racette displays very well.

The use of puppets in this production seemed to stir a lot of controversy, especially with the role of Dolore (Butterfly and Pinkerton's son). I simply am confused with the controversy, perhaps I'm missing something because it is not in the least bit tasteless. The suspension of disbelief allows us to accept that Japanese and American people are singing back and forth to each other in Italian. Further, the portrayal of Japan in this opera (and the original short story and other adaptations of the tale) has a warped vision of Japan. The fact that the leading character has ""san"" at the end as an actual part of her name (rather than the fact that it's a title, thus not part of her name) shows some ignorance. If the suspension of disbelief allows this, then it can allow us to accept that the puppet is the boy. Perhaps the controversy was because of the West's image of puppetry. In Japan, puppet theater is essential, and it was done here accurately; three people shrouded in black control the puppet.

Traditionally in puppet theater the whole show is puppets rather than a single character. But I found the juxtaposition really fascinating and above all: tasteful. I've seen a lot of obnoxious regietheater productions (all of which claim they're trying to bring in a new audience, yet I'm in this new audience and they confuse me more than anything. Of course when I say that, they immediately change my position and accuse me of conservative snobbery! Cognitive dissonance in the artistic world). Nothing was over-the-top in this production with the one exception being the end of Act I (the ""long duet"" as it seems to be referred to) where Pinkerton and Butterfly were surrounded by floating, dancing lanterns. The addition of short mimed moments were also nice touches. It begins with a woman dancing with a pair of fans to pure silence on an empty, red stage. It immediately immerses you in in this foreign world.

All in all, I found this to be an astounding performance. Madama Butterfly is not a personal favorite show of mine (perhaps I am biased because I studied a lot of its history and art). Incidents similar to the events in Madama Butterfly though did happen, and certainly show a shameful moment in the West's History. The visually stunning production with an accurate mix of traditional theater from both a Western perspective (proper costumes and acting) and Eastern one (proper costumes, puppet theater, mime/gestures, and certain uses of props) make this a unique treat to watch. The voices were a let-down at times, but it didn't stop me from enjoying it by any means.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone. It must be entered with a bit of background information on Puppet Theater, but that could be something as simple as a search for a video on Youtube. If the idea is foreign to you, give it a try. Traditional Japanese Theater has some fascinating elements, and perhaps this interesting production will spark some more interest in it. The performance was believable nearly the entire time, and the singing throughout was mostly perfect. There may have been rough patches, but it definitely didn't ruin it for me.",1292889600,65,6635,4.798775153105861

Also, the thing that I found most BIZARRE is, instead of casting a real child (her son) in this play, they used a PUPPET, with 2 guys moving it around the stage with Butterfly as she was singing her woes. This really did it for me.  Couldn't take it. That's why only 3 stars. But, if you want top notch opera singing and don't care about the other stuff, purchase this rendition of the Opera.

4336397,3,B004ECFW7Q,"a rather disappointing performance. Butterfly was sung with hardly a distinction between love, hope and despair; so not the best interpretation of this part. The voice itself is not steady and sounds to heavy.  Better go for Moffo or Freni.
Sharpless is OK. Rest of the cast is not toplevel. The Met should be able to contract better acting and above all better singing artists. I know, there are no Domingo's, Pavarotti's, Bergonzi's, Valetti's etc anymore, but Marcello Gordani would not be my first choice. Maybe a matter of taste, but still......
Introducing the puppets is a very good idea and the decors, lightning re excellent. But the costumes etc. are ""shouting"" and cheap looking. Unfortunately the chorus looks very middle aged and atcs tiredly.
I have 7 performances of Madama Butterfly on DVD; this one does not rank very highly. As said: go for Freni /von Karajan on DGG ( if you can afford it: get Moffo also).",1446595200,,925,4.817610062893082

4336404,5,B004ECFW7Q,"Madama Butterfly is without a doubt one of the great operatic masterpieces.  This MET production was quite a revelation and makes justice to the great Puccini work.  It looks bare and simple, but serves perfectly the story, the characters, and the emotions, while maintaining a visually stunning interpretation of this love-tragedy story in every scene.  Anthony Minghella achieves so much with so little: theres no fluffiness, excessive props, or elaborated sets that could drown the production; the striking simplicity makes the audience focus on the music, the libretto, and the voices.  The theatrical aspect of this production makes it fresh and effective.
The cast is great.  In the title role, Patricia Racette achieves moments of greatness.  This role is a tour de force for any soprano, and she keeps the voice in top shape throughout.  I particularly loved her dynamics and pianissimi in Act II and of course, the suicide scene sung to perfection.  As Suzuki, Maria Zifchak is great.  Her voice and interpretation of the role makes her Suzuki take a more important role than typically presented in other productions.  Marcello Giordanis Pinkerton is alright, I feel his voice is not as sweet as I imagine Pinkerton to have, but he sings the role well.  Dwayne Croft is in top form for his Sharpless.  With Patrick Summers at the podium, the MET orchestra and chorus sound glorious.  This, to me, is going to be a production that will remain as one of the best in history, and will be difficult to match its beauty and accuracy to serve the composers music.",1417651200,,1566,4.931297709923665

4336409,5,B004ECFW7Q,"This first-rate production of Madama Butterfly is a somewhat minimalist setting on the traditional side so that the staging does not get in the way of the music. Singing and acting are up to Metropolitan Opera standards, even the minor roles, but two performers stand out. Patricia Racette as Cio-Cio-San again showed what a fine dramatic soprano she is with a performance that gripped me from her entrance to her death. Her rendition of ""Un bel di"" is heart-wringing. The portrayal of a 15-year-old Japanese maiden by a singer in her early forties is a tad jarring at first, but her performance was so effective that after the first few moments the age difference disappears. Dwayne Croft again gives a strong and sensitive performance as Sharpless, a role he practically owns by now, having performed it at the Met fifty-four times since he first sang it at the Met in 1992.

Maria Zifchak gives her usual fine portrayal of Suzuki, having performed it seventy times in her fourteen years at the Met. Marcello Giordano plays Pinkerton as the shallow and insensitive character that he is. Conductor Patrick Summers hits Puccini's emotionally-fraught music on the nose.

Portrayal of the child Sorrow as a puppet is an interesting and (to me) innovative technique. After all, his role is that of the focus of his mother's emotions, and for that a well-manipulated puppet, as this is, works better in some ways than a live and docile child.

I have only two quibbles. For one, I could do without the ballets before and during the preludes. They add nothing; Puccini's music can speak for itself. Second, the brief pantomime of Cio-Cio-San and Pinkerton at the beginning of the second act was confusing. Clearly it is meant to show the passage of time, but we already know that this act takes place three years later and Pinkerton is long gone, so it takes one aback for a moment. Those small trespasses aside, this is a performance of Madama Butterfly worth owning.",1393027200,3,1963,4.836309523809524

I wish you can bring the old version back...maybe a couple of times a year...I know this cannot be done...just a dream... too much money!

Maybe someone can go into the MET or another House archives and provide a choice on DVDs of the old ""Little House on the Hill"" that we used to enjoy so much.

The minimal scenery is fine, and the puppetry with the child is astounding.  I did not even notice the 3 puppeters!

Many people do not like Butterfly for the story; however, the music is too beautiful to miss.  The story is only one of many following any war!  It is life.  Thank you Puccini for providing such a contemporary opera for us to enjoy repeatedly.

I remember seeing many operas where the soprano and tenor sang to the audience with little emotion.  Today, especially at Met Movie productions, in addition to a voice, you have to be able to act.  You have to demonstrate emotion with your facial expressions and acting ability.  Opera has come a long way in a short time recently.  This is one example of an opera everyone should see.",1370217600,3,993,4.419889502762431
4336418,3,B004ECFW7Q,"""Madame Butterfly"" by Puccini is one of the great operas. The audio history of it goes all the way back to the first performance casts, with Krushelnytska (May 1904 version) Zenatello (May 1904). (This was the 2nd of the 5 versions of the opera).  Both these singers recorded music from their roles.  At the Metropolitan in New York, the major Butterfly of the time was Geraldine Farrar. Her usual partner was Caruso. They recorded plenty of their music, too.  In fact many of the early great interpretors of the roles were recorded using the acoustic process and later the electrical process.  The 1956 version with Anna Moffo, Renato Coni, Afro Poli (127 mins b&w) is better sung, better acted and better than the current version.  Butterfly is a role that has been sung by Destinn, Callas, Price, Tebaldi, Scotto, Freni and every soprano of vocal weight to match the huge orchestral climaxes. Patricia Racette while very nice is simply not in the class of the abovementioned great ladies of opera. She is adequate in the role, adequate on stage, an adequate actress--that is to say--she moves around on stage without breaking anything. Her version of the music is unidiomatic. This is to say this is NOT ITALIAN!  The cast, dragged in from all over the world demonstrates the weakness and strengths of the ""international"" system of opera as it is worked today in leading opera houses.  If the singing is mediocre at best, the production is wonderful, exotic, modern and beautiful. However, anyone who goes to an opera like ""Madame Butterfly"" and comes out talking about the scenery, has witnessed a failed performance.  It is the singing, ""pace"" stage directors, that is the most important thing in opera. This is why such pleasure can be derived from a recording with no visuals.  If you want a great audio only of Butterfly, Price and Tucker will change your life. If it is Italians you want, Tebaldi and Bergonzi or Scotto and Bergonzi with Barbirolli, or Pavarotti and Freni from 1974 for a more recent example. Too bad the sung side of this DVD doesn't match the production side.",1369612800,4,2087,4.823529411764706
4336419,3,B004ECFW7Q,"While I like this performance It lacked some of the tension that I have seen in other productions.  The role of Pinkerton was not terribly good,but really just passible",1363651200,,168,4.793103448275862
4336420,5,B004ECFW7Q,"So incredibly sad.  I have just begun my foray into the operatic world, and having seen this before I knew it would be great music.

4336421,5,B004ECFW7Q,"""Madame Butterfly"" is one of Puccini's greatest operas, which says a lot considering most of his operas are so utterly brilliant. It's loaded with emotion from outrageous passion to unquenchable grief. I cannot imagine anyone seeing Butterfly, especially this production, keeping a dry eye. It's just heart wrenching. No one since Puccini has been able to evoke such emotion in music.

Of course, he had a whopper of a tragic story. And it is the story that I find annoying because the tragedy is so blatantly the result of utter selfishness on the part of a lead love interest. None of it had to happen. But then, Puccini wouldn't have had such a great vehicle for his outstanding talent.

So I love ""Butterfly"" and hate it at the same time! It is totally bittersweet.

I've seen several performances, and I think THIS one at the Met is absolutely outstanding. However, you have to get used to some very innovative and emotionally unsettling theatrical approaches.

Since most people know the story of Butterfly and its strengths and weaknesses, I'll forgo that to focus on why this is a great DVD to own of this amazing Metropolitan Opera Production. It's all about the production!

Not only is it an exciting live stage performance, it also takes advantage of  striking videography. I don't know how the production must have looked to the live audience (we get a few glimpses from the audience perspective perhaps for reference), but to me, watching the DVD, and getting the benefit of the close ups and excellent camera work and direction, I felt I got an excellent video performance designed to be a video performance, not a record of a live performance.

So it is a two in one production, showing great sensitivity on the part of the producers. It raises the bar for all other performances because these days, with the importance of video (i.e. going straight to DVD), theater is challenged with staging in a way that moves a live audience, who cannot see in closeup, and a video audience who CAN see in close up-- at the same time. It's one thing to pop a camera onto a tripod and point it at the stage, it's another to move with the performance, zooming in and out as needed while never interfering with that performance. The latter takes added direction, and improves the quality and outreach of the production to a wider audience. Bravo MET for this production's video direction and quality, you got it all right! It is thrilling to watch on DVD.

Now let's talk about some really spectacular stuff, the singers and the orchestra!

They are amazing! All of them. No question. Very moving. Not only are they beautiful to hear, they are wonderful to watch. They make this opera performance a feast for the eyes as well as the ears. Even if you don't like the staging, this version is worth it just for the fantastic musical performances and the acting.

Opera can fail when it is a bunch of people standing on stage not doing anything, or it can soar when even in their ""off time"" while still on stage, characters are interacting or showing emotions and responses to what others are doing and singing. The cast of this production get it all spot on, making the opera much more intriguing. You sometimes aren't sure just where to look. That's what's great about having the DVD, I can watch over and over, shifting my focus each time. Re-play value counts!

The music would fail if it didn't have the power of a grand orchestra and a sensitive conductor. No worries in this MET production!

The brilliant Metropolitan orchestra delivers with a one-two knockout punch. The dynamic range and control is excellent, moving, and deeply emotional. Timing and pacing seems perfect. The singers are never overwhelmed by the full orchestra, and yet when the orchestra diminishes, it never becomes weak. The sound is crisp, precise, and exciting. Absolutely top notch. Another Bravo.

So sonically, the opera is a big hit with me, it represents all the power and passion of Puccini with a great deal of impact. Puccini, like Wagner, needs to be driven, loud and in-your-face, because that was what he was going for. The Met Orchestra and singers deliver and then some. Spectacular!

Now on to the staging, the production. Personally, I loved it, but not everybody may.

This is very controversial among reviewers. Yes, it is minimalist, but I think I understand why. By reducing the sets to screens and using traditional Japanese treatments, they kept the focus on the emotions of the characters (and could they POSSIBLY be MORE emotional?) Puccini's music is all about emotion, gobs and gobs of it. So I think they gave the music the lead and the sets were to follow. The use of the minimal sets also allowed the brilliant costumes to shine, and gave the actors and singers plenty of freedom of movement. I thought it was a great way to stage the opera.

The costumes are absolutely outstanding. Not only are they traditional Japanese (and let's face it, nothing compares to a well decked out Kimono) they are very colorful and dramatic on stage, a feast for the eyes and inspiration for the imagination. Naturally, the hair and make up are of the same quality. This whole production is top notch quality.

There is SO MUCH to see and enjoy, again and again. Total re-play value.

There is one thing that I found utterly fascinating and a bit of a conundrum. It's a point of some contention among some reviewers -- and that is the use of traditional Japanese puppets, and some unexplained ballet.

For example, the opera opens in silence (except for the noise of the audience - who are very noisy for some reason) as a Japanese fan dancer slowly comes down the stage. That's one of the ""Huh?"" moments of the production, but one heck of a way to start things off. John Cage would have loved it! I'm still trying to figure it out. I appreciate it, it's beautifully done, and an amazing way to start things off. I KNOW there's a message in it, but I haven't quite got it. I shall have to watch it again and see if I can figure it out. Innovative? Absolutely. Risky? Definitely. Memorable? Obviously.

The second outstanding innovation in the production is the use of traditional Japanese Bunraku puppets.

What? Puppets?

YES, and they work brilliantly. The direction and performance of these silent characters is haunting.

They show up in the most unexpected places.

First we see a pair as house servants. These puppets have little to do, but are probably just a way of introducing the audience to the idea that there will be puppets in the performance.

We get a very touching puppet performance in what I think is a type of puppet ballet/dream sequence during an extended intermezzo. It is a tableau and encapsulation scene.

There are two main characters; a strikingly handsome, stylized bald dancer who represents Pinkerton, and a puppet who represents Butterfly.

The Butterfly puppet is expertly managed by the puppeteers and she (they?) are dance ""partners"" to Pinkerton's dream surrogate.  These great performers convey deep emotion through movement, and their dance really tells us, in a nutshell what we already know.

They drive home the point, that Pinkerton is an indifferent betrayer as a lover, out for his own interests and lusts, while Butterfly is a hopeless romantic, desperately in love and dependent upon him. The power of dance.

Of course we know this to be the case, but to have it so graphically displayed through such simple and elegant dance adds to the impact of the whole story. It's so tough and moving to watch at the end of the sequence when Pinkerton rejects Butterfly and in a swirl of brilliant blue satin, she is drawn off and away into darkness, lost to him and to us. Really heady stuff and brilliantly done!

They could have done only this and it would have been outstanding, but they did even more in the production with the puppets.

There is the final uber puppet - almost the star of the show - and the least expected character of all, ""Sorrow"", Butterfly's child.

The directors and producers decided to cast the role of ""Sorrow"" as a Japanese puppet. It's brilliantly done, if totally unexpected, especially for an American traditional audience. And that's the conundrum.

""Sorrow"" has no lines, and a mask for a face, yet he (like his Butterfly puppet counterpart in the ballet) is the one of the MOST expressive characters in the opera, almost overshadowing the wonderfully powerful lead singers! It's ironic that in an opera, the one character who never sings a note, moved me to tears with his silent emotions. He steals the show!

I have seen performances using live children who just can't touch what goes on here. How can a piece of wood out perform a live human being? What do the producers of this MET performance know that everyone else is missing?

Much of the credit for ""Sorrow"" naturally goes to his brilliant puppeteers. Working in traditional Japanese style, they are hidden, yet present. They are the shadow, and the soul, of the silent child.

And what a soul they display. It's all about body language and intense intimacy. It is deeply moving, emotionally disturbing and total cognitive dissonance. I cannot figure out why this performance moves me so deeply, but I see the mechanical child as desperately fragile, a perfect reflection of his doomed mother, who herself is a ""puppet"" dancing to Pinkerton's manipulative play on the strings of her innocent and naive heart.

Here's where having the DVD or a video copy of the performance comes into its greatest strength. You really have to watch these talented artists closely as they work the puppet. THEIR faces and THEIR eyes give the child expression. I doubt that the live audience was able to catch this. And if the director was only concerned with them (the live audience), the puppeteers probably would have done well enough manipulating the boy and remaining truly anonymous.

But the fact that they ARE so emotionally involved and brought INTO the performance on the video level, and that we can SEE it on the DVD makes me feel that the directors and producers of this opera were very sensitive to a wide audience and delivered on all counts. BRAVO!

At the end, in the final scene, this magnificent performance is so heartbreaking, I dove for the box of tissues.

The puppets were made by Blind Summit Theater, but no credit is given to the exact designers, (although the puppeteers are identified on their website). So it is impossible to know who to thank for these wonderful creations. Whoever made these puppets was (were, are?) a genius, from sculpture through costume. These ""little people"" are very much alive!

When Patricia Racette is singing and holding the child, DANG, it seems more alive than a REAL child! Tragically so, heartbreakingly so. The same is true of the dream ballet. Gosh, it is so mind blowing!

There is a scene during another long orchestral intermezzo (actually just after the dream sequence, when Buttrerfly and ""Sorrow"" are awake) where Racette (Butterfly), ""Sorrow"", and his puppeteers look with wonder at a flock of birds, which are also puppets.

I have had to watch that scene over and over because it amazes me so much. The birds are so simple, origami in style, yet so well managed by their puppeteers that they look like they really are in flight. And Racette and ""Sorrow"" are absolutely convincing as a mother sharing the wonder of her child discovering this simple beauty of nature. She plays off the puppet like he is a real boy and he plays off her like he is a real boy in a way I have never seen a real boy do on stage. Shades of Pinocchio! It's brilliant.

Stuff like this doesn't come along every day. It is true art.

Now, for some this may be too much, too much in the abstract, too much mixture of Japanese puppet theater with Italian grand opera (yes, it is grand). But for me, it raised the already high art form of opera to a new level, which I think is very hard to do.

I admit, there is plenty of the ""Huh?"" in this production because it is so daring, innovative and different. It takes some getting used to. I found it easy to do so, and discovered it to be deeply disturbing on an emotional level. I think it really does match what Puccini was doing with his music. It isn't just tragic, it is disturbingly tragic.

For example, in the scene where Pinkerton shows up with his American wife, they play it all for sympathy. That wife could have been haughty and proud, arrogant, rude, demanding. But instead she is tender and touching as she looks helplessly upon the tragic scene as Pinkerton demands his child in spite of what it will do to Butterfly. She, like Butterfly, is a victim of this terribly selfish and arrogant, indifferent traitor of a man. The feeling I got was that she will spend the rest of her life living with the guilt of what she was a party to. Of course, there's nothing she can do, and that's part of the tragedy.

The puppet ""Sorrow"" is a significant part of this scene, and we aren't done with him yet! For those who CAN appreciate the use of puppets backing amazing musical singing, I have a warning.

The final scene is awesome, just awesome, and AWFUL - as in AWE - FULL.

Awe-Full because it is so brilliantly done that the tragedy is hideous, almost unbearable.

Get out the tissues, you WILL need them. Here is why:

When Butterfly must release her child to Pinkerton, then decides to commit suicide, and is interrupted by the child ""Sorrow"" -- dang, it is just too much to bear. Once again everything gels.

The brilliant Racette acts and sings her heart out (at this point, she OWNS Butterfly), the puppet, ""Sorrow"" is so masterfully manipulated and she interacts with him so tenderly that it makes intensely compelling theater.

Take advantage of what the DVD provides, those closeups, and watch the puppeteers closely; they are the child's soul and their expressions and body language themselves are fantastic. They enhance the amazing music and the emotional impact is profound. It is actually haunting! I wanted to rescue the pair of them! Of course, that can't happen, ever. No one can rescue these two, they have been doomed by their creator, Puccini, to torment audiences forever with their tragic circumstances.

Sniff.

Conclusion:

B R A V O  M E T!

This is a quality production in very high and somewhat abstract stage style on top of brilliant musical performances, costuming, and acting that offers a unique perspective for video viewers. The singing is top rate, the orchestra is outstanding, the costumes are brilliant.

If you can work with the unorthodox staging (which I really enjoyed) and can get into the puppets (which I adored), I think you will find new meaning in this greatly loved opera.

It may give you two reactions, as it did me.

I hate it for what happens -- it is hideously cruel. That's not really the MET, that's the story and Puccini. Always was. It's a tear jerker. What the MET did was kick it up so high, it is in the artistic stratosphere. That's a major accomplishment with such a well known 100 year old opera. Totally new life!

I love it for how this MET production makes it all unfold, how it drew me in, how it captured me and my heart as much as Pinkerton captured Butterfly's heart. The ""feel"" is amazing, the sense of ""theater"" - even in video - is pure magic. It is hauntingly beautiful on so many levels, even though it is so painfully tragic.

The production is pure inspiration, food for thought, and the images and performances will haunt me for quite some time, especially ""Sorrow"" and his puppeteers.

My mind is reeling from the experience. I feel I have been to another world and come back.

When a production can pull that off, it is a major success.

Oh, and I needed a lot of tissues!

4336423,5,B004ECFW7Q,"I wasn't going to write a review but after reading some of the ""bad"" reviews here, figured I would put in my two cents.  In my opinion, this is will probably be ""the"" Madama Butterfly against which future productions of this opera will be rated against.  I have to say I am not a huge fan of minimalist productions, but sometimes they work and sometimes they dont. My biggest problem is when those productions take liberties with the libretto in order to make it fit. This production though I must say it worked perfectly.  How can you not be moved when they were singing the love duet at the end of the first act!  All I kept thinking was God I need to go to New York and see this live!!.  I do have to say that for all her popularity - Patricia Racette might not be ""the"" best Butterfly ever vocally, but she was not as awful as some reviewer here makes her out to be.  You do have to admit her acting was incredible, which is more than you can say for some singers these day that feel that all they need to get by on the opera stage is hit a few high notes and look pretty while doing it.  One thing I must mention and this holds true of any telecast.  What looks good on the stage while you are sitting a few feet away from it, does not necessarily look good close up.  When they decide to tape these performances,  they need to have some sort of rehearsal and make changes or study screen shots.

I was moved the most by the use of puppetry in the production, particularly with Butterfly's child, which is a groundbreaking idea for an opera which normally relies on a little girl to play the non-verbal boy role.  The child is animated by three people controlling the body, and whose faces are somewhat visible under masks; they seem to transmit their emotions magically to the puppet, and it is so easy to get caught up in the imaginative simplicity of it all that the boy, like Pinocchio, seems real.  Racette and Marcello Giordani are perfect for the lead roles (Giordani in particular, since he plays the good guy role of Calaf in Puccini's ""Turandot,"" this is a polar opposite for him and which he does well).  I couldn't not own this DVD.  The Met is known for making operatic memories, and this is great for any fan's collection.",1355875200,3,1003,4.808139534883721

There is exactly zero background scenery, or atmosphere, throughout the whole opera.  The passion and the drama of the singing are ruined by moving dark shadows in the background.  Puppetry has no place in this opera.  The hideous puppetry destroys the ""Oh eh! Oh eh!"" chorus in the introduction of the Third Act.  It is grossly unfair that the singing in this beautiful opera has to compete with cheap theatrics, which is what Minghella's trash is all about.

4336434,4,B004ECFW7Q,"I saw the summer re-run of Madame Butterfly, having unfortunately missed the original HD broadcast. It was actually rather nice that they did away with the original intermission(s), as this helped maintain the dramatic flow of the evening. Minghella was such an intelligent, thoughtful and poetic director, one of my favorites, and I eagerly looked forward to his production. He did not disappoint. His stagecraft, and what has been referred to as ""minimalist"" style, were potent without being either over- or under-done and made excellent use of the space on stage. The beautiful and vibrant costuming also added much to his visual style. I liked his use of the smooth-moving screens and also the lanterns. I thought his use of a puppet for Butterfly's son was brilliant. The puppeteers expertly gave him fine nuance and gesture and succeeded in creating a credible and dramatic performance. Some reviewers said the black-clad figures operating him were a distraction, but one must remember that opera is a distance medium; it's not likely a viewer in the audience (especially in the cavernous Met) would have noticed their movements nearly as much as the closeup view given by the camera on the lip of the stage gave. I found it amazing that the inanimate face of the puppet almost seemed to take on different expressions according to the subtle movements of his head and neck, in harmony with the rest of his body. It was mesmerizing.

The singing was uniformly good to very good, with Patricia Racette outstanding as Butterfly. Her lovely voice has a clarity and thrust which allows her to be heard at any dynamic, but one never sensed her applying vocal technique for emphasis on top of her touching characterization. When her voice bloomed in arching phrases, it was always with expressive emotion. Singing and acting were absolutely fused together in her performance, and she was rightly rewarded with a huge ovation at the end. Yes, she is nowhere near fifteen hears old, and she is neither trim or slender; but when she sang in a voice like springtime, those details mattered much less to me. She really captured the spirit and naivete of a young girl coming into adulthood under tragic circumstances. Maria Zifchak was a solid and sympathetic Suzuki, and also offered a voice of beauty and clarity, blending well with Racette. The men's roles were slightly less satisfying to me. Marcello Giordani is one today's front ranking tenors and Puccini's music suits his soaring voice well. However, I found his characterization a bit pale in comparison to Racette's, and at times his top notes sounded rough and oversung. Dwayne Croft as Sharpless was a sympathetic actor and dramatically held his own with the rest of the cast; sadly, his voice seems to have the lost some of its point and sheen, although he always phrases with beauty and musicality. Greg Fedderly as Goro was sharp in both characterization and voice. The steely quality of his tenor would probably serve him well in a Wagner role such as Mime.

The theatre audience to seemed genuinely enjoy the performance, often joining the Met audience in moments of applause. For me, it was everything I'd hoped for. I have seen Butterfly at the San Francisco Opera house with Catherine Malfitano, another fine singing actress, as Butterfly, and I've come to realize how crucial it is to have a singer of these qualities in this demanding role. When you get artists of the caliber of Racette and Minghella, you can be sure you will experience a performance of superior quality and artistic excellence. The world of cinema and theatre lost a treasure when Minghella passed away in 2008. I look forward to having my DVD of this wonderful performance.",1308614400,5,3710,4.924920127795527
4336435,5,B004ECFW7Q,"I don't agree with some of these reviews.  My dad and i just saw this in HD last night at the theater and we were both blown away.  Rachette's clear soprano voice was amazing, she caught me at the word go.  I was tired and didn't feel like going, but was i glad i did.  This was worth my time and money, and i think some reviews are incorrect.  I'm a singer myself, and while there was a couple of flat notes here and there, in no way was this a distraction to the performance.  I doubt people really noticed anything amiss.  No matter how professional a singer is, sometimes your voice is going to do what it's going to do. I found not the puppets a distraction, but the puppeteers.  While they were good at expressing Sorrow's emotions through motion, the many people it took to maneuver to do this got to be a little too much at times.  Seeing the hands of the puppeteers i found the most distracting, because it just brought home that this was a puppet and not a real child (paging pinocchio?).

4336436,5,B004ECFW7Q,"Just a few minutes ago I came back from the Met Hi-Def Encore presentation of this Butterfly, which I also saw when it was originally broadcast in 2009.  Okay, Patricia Racette is not 15 (born in 1965).  In fact, in her interview with Renee Fleming between acts, she even joked about that, saying it was difficult to play a girl ""half"" her age...knowing full well that she was 44 when she performed it.  The look on her face when she said ""half my age"" was priceless.  And she is not Japanese.  But if you want to see a spectacular Butterfly who combines singing with acting in the best Puccini tradition, look no further.  The production may not be everybody's cup of tea but it *is* thought provoking.  I'm neutral on Marcello Giordani but Dwayne Croft's Sharpless and especially Maria Zifchak's Suzuki were spectacular; apparently Zifchak has turned this role into a franchise for her.

4336438,5,B004ECFW7Q,"Since I generally prefer traditional productions, I was somewhat skeptical as I sat down to watch and hear Anthony Minghella's production of the most performed opera in the Unites States, and perhaps the world - Madama Butterfly.  Adding to my concern and curiosity was the advertised use of puppetry in this Metropolitan Opera HD series event. Let me come right to the point in this critique: this opera pulls you in! I was totally mesmerized and after three beautiful hours, felt like I should feel after hearing and viewing an opera. My reaction is not surprising when I review the different facets of this production:
  (1) THE SETS: yes, they are minimalist, but, when you think about it, this is one opera which doesn't really need elaborate sets; most of the drama occurs inside a Japanese house, which does indeed make use of sliding screens. The use of these screens in this production was actually quite clever and did reinforce the notion that the setting is Japan.
  (2) COSTUMES: credited to Han Feng; just a glorious display of color. Easily, the best costuming I've seen in any production of this opera, at least, those available on DVD.
  (3) THE MUSIC: Maestro Patrick Summers conducts a flawless performance of the Met's Orchestra; the music never overpowers the singers and yet, reaches our ears with the power to move us as the composer intended. Puccini would have applauded.
  (4) THE SINGERS: Let's begin with the title role. Cio-Cio-San (Butterfly) can be compared with that of Juliet in ""Romeo and Juliet"". Ideally, one would cast a mid-teen young lady, and yet, to date, there has never been a young female actress/singer capable of expressing all the emotions that their character calls for. In the PAST world of opera, one had to be content with a soprano up to the demands of a role such as Madama Butterfly, that calls for an almost continuous stage presence from the middle of the first act until the end of the third and final act. Historically, singing ability was the criterion, making factors such as age and appearance, irrelevant.  (Examples: a grossly overweight Pavarotti as a ""handsome"" Radames in Aida; a sixty-year old Sutherland as ""the Daughter"" of the Regiment in an Australian Opera production.) BUT, in TODAY'S world, where operatic productions are being filmed as well as recorded - where the visual aspects of a production will be important to the sale of DVDs and Blu Ray discs - singers are being groomed who cannot only sing but who are believable as the characters they represent. Thinks of handsome tenors such as Florez, Villazon and Kaufmann; beautiful sopranos like Netrebko, attractive mezzos like Garanca and baritones like Keenlyside, etc. I submit that Patricia Racette strikes a good balance between youth and experience and is here a very convincing Butterfly. I do not agree with those reviewers who found some faults with her voice; I, for one, did not detect any, and indeed, of the seven DVDs I own of this opera, her death scene is the best both vocally and dramatically.
  All of the principal singers were in good form the day they recorded this production.  Tenor Marcello Giordani, whose rendition of ""Nessun Dorma"" in the Met's last production of ""Turandot"", compared with Pavarotti's, impresses me here with his clarity of tone and ability to portray Pinkerton, not as a villain but as a flawed human being who does not realize the tragic consequences of his amorous affair with his Japanese bride. Dwayne Croft, a veteran of the Met, as Sharpless, is a good example of why baritones today are being afforded the prominence once reserved to their tenor colleagues.  As Suzuki, Maria Zifchak, another Met stalwart, is able to bring out all the nuances in her character; she is not just Butterfly's servant, but companion in suffering. I was particularly impressed by her actually coming to tears when she is about to inform her mistress of Pinkerton's new wife.
  (5) THE USE OF PUPPETS: Easily, this is the most controversial aspect of this production. It shouldn't be. A cardinal rule in criticism is that one shouldn't condemn a work one hasn't read, seen or heard. That rule applies here. Even though several puppets were employed in this production (several servants and one of Butterfly in a ballet scene), the one puppet who manages to captivate the audience is Butterfly's young son. Of all the child actors who have been cast in this part, THIS PUPPET IS THE FINEST OF THEM ALL! No three-year old would be capable of portraying awe, happiness, wonderment, sadness, and affection in the way that this three-foot tall ""artificial child"" has managed to do it. Great credit, of course, must be given to his three black-clad handlers, but after a while, they seem to disappear in the viewer's eye and mind. Please do not let the idea of puppets deter you from experiencing this magnificent production. You will be captivated by their use and might just forget that they are in the production.
  (6) BUTTERFLY'S DEATH SCENE: has been described by other reviewers. Such a simple idea: use red cloth to symbolize blood. But add light effects and I could have sworn that the entire stage was covered with Cio-Cio-San's blood. Very effective, and coupled with Puccini's dramatic music, a powerful ending.",1307232000,125,5276,4.902356902356902
4336439,1,B004ECFW7Q,"I think this production, like so much of the new, austere stuff, is woeful.  Here is an opera which brings me to tears, just relating its plot, but watching this incisive, dehumanized treatment does not get any tears from me.  Not a solitary tear, and I tried it two times live.  This opera is like onions, I always cry.

Why is there a puppet for the child?  I know ..  authentic Japanese art form.  Come on man, this is an Italian opera.  This is Puccini.  He's trying to make you feel for the woman and the child, and sympathise with their plight.  This is an opera where you are supposed to feel, and to think about feelings, and to think about people you love.  How am I supposed to feel about a puppet with three guys running around it, administering its movements?  I wind up marveling at their dexterity, and totally distracted.

They've done a nice job with the pretty dresses.  Very colorful.

The Met has gone downhill so fast.  Why couldn't they take out the failed productions, instead of overrun the successful ones?

The previous production of this, as for so many operas, didn't distract me with cleverness or starkness, mixed media, or other overwrought random surprises, but focused my attention on the drama by faithfully and natively creating a visual for me which I could sink my mind into and asborb the plot.

Another mindless extravagance is the new Traviata, w bare wall, the oversized clock, and staring man bearing down on us, signifying 'Time'.  Every bit of these things serves to isolate my compassion, and beat it like a slave to be mastered.

It would be appropriate to pair sets like this w Lulu or Die Frau Ohne Shotten, or something from Reich or Kraftwerk which suggests a disconnected, dehumanized society.  Not this opera, a sensitive human drama.

Clearly, WW1 really got into Europe's nerves.  The Dada movement, and ever since, it's been about desecrating, destroying, stripping down, reassembling.  Meanwhile, these Europeans will fret about 'authentic' instrumentation, while they're reimagining Carmen as a gas station attendant.  Gratuitous novelty, intellectual immaturity, and cynicism.

On top of that, we have the Met now pushing for some more Broadway flavored shtick, for people w attention deficit disorder or simpler standards.  They're trying to wow the crowd w affects.  I'm not going to waste my time or my money until I hear about a change.

The Met used to be a good bargain.  You can't put a price on garbage, unless you're recycling.  Maybe they can use the dresses in a new set?  And they can use the puppet in Central Park.

Lousy, lousy, just {expletive} lousy.",1307145600,21,2624,4.811659192825112
4336440,2,B004ECFW7Q,"I listened to the radio broadcast of this performance, the day it was streamed to theaters and recorded for television and DVD release.  I found it satisfactory, but not particularly outstanding Metropolitan fare.
I have only today seen the production, and I found that the music was sacrificed in favor of gimmickry.  I have no great problem with minimalistic stagings, in general.  The Met's ""Romeo et Juliet"" and ""Eugene Onegin,"" for example, were quite believable.  But, in this case, the constant moving of screen panels back and forth, often without apparent reason, became very confusing as well as distracting.  Black shadows behind the screens, sometimes of characters about to appear, but often with no rhyme or reason, also drew attention from the play's action.  Black clad ""stage hands,"" sometimes waving flying birds, lanterns, or whirling streamers, sometimes moving the screen panels, and sometimes just there, further took attention away from the story.  I will grant, however, that the arrivals of characters from back stage was a good touch.
While Patricia Racette's Butterfly was neither great nor terrible musically, I did feel that dramatically her interpretation missed the boat.  If I had not been familiar with the sense of ""Un bel di,"" I would have presumed from her actions and facial expressions that she had given up hope Pinkerton would ever return.
The biggest disappointment to me came in Act II, with the entrance of the puppet Trouble.  I felt that all of this section was designed, not for the music or the story line, but to display the artistry of the puppeteers.  Much of the movement was unrealistic and jerky, distracting from the reality of Butterfly's dilemma.  The visibility of the puppeteers added to the lack of believability.
I recognize from other reviews that this was an attempt to simulate Japanese theater.  If so, why was it not sung in Japanese? If I want Japanese theater, I will look for it in other places than the opera house.
Just a year before this production was recorded, the New York City Opera televised a production with Shu-Ying Li and James Valenti, which was at least the equal musically to this one, and far superior in realism.  Perhaps someone will provide this on DVD.

Addendum December 17, 2011:  I just listened to the Saturday broadcast with Liping Zhang and Robert Dean Smith.  Far superior musically to the Racette/Giordano.",1305936000,9,2402,5.027777777777778
4336441,4,B004ECFW7Q,"This innovative staging of Madama Butterfly was the first staging of Peter Gelb's tenure as general maager of the Met. Staged by Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) set the tone for much that has followed: bright colors, stripped-down sets, and above all, a Big Name at the helm of a much-hyped new production of a repertory staple. But whatever weird turns the Met has taken in the last five years, this remains the visual record of an important Butterfly that marked the start of a new artistic era.

This two-disc set, released on Sony Classics earlier this year, preserves the Met Live in HD broadcast of Butterfly, starring Patricia Racette as Cio-Cio San and Maria Zifchak as her faithful housemaid Suzuki. It also serves as a fitting memorial to Mr. Minghella, who died one year before this telecast was filmed. Happily, this is a brilliant rendering of Puccini's opera, with dramatic and scenic focus on the tragedy at hand.

Rather than some attempt to recreate the landscape of pre-atomic Nagasaki on the Met's vast stage, Mr. Minghella took this work back to its Japanese roots, incorporating elements of Noh theater. Butterfly's hillside house becomes a ""zoned"" acting space, cut through with small, sliding shoji. Black-clad kuroko stagehands move, ghost-like through its movable walls. Colorful, authentic Japanese costumes are very much a feature, from the elaborate kimonos to Goro's bobbing kanmuri hat, worn to inappropriate, (and hilarious) effect by this glorified pimp. The most famous effect though, is the controversial use of bunraku puppets, most notably to play Butterfly's son, ""Trouble.""

This is a high-level performance of the opera, anchored by the veteran soprano of Ms. Racette. She understands every aspect of the character, creating a Buttrfly who rapidly travels the downward slide from innocent geisha bride to unwed mother and suicide. Her potent ""Un bel di"" is the keystone of the entire performance, but it is the seemingly spontaneous moments like her Act II interactions with Sharpless (Dwayne Croft) and Yamadori (David Won) that help this Butterfly soar.

Mr. Giordani is in good voice as Pinkerton, portraying one of the most ungrateful louses to grace the operatic stage. The Act I interactions with Goro (Greg Fedderly) and Butterfly's large family show the character's blithe ignorance of Japanese culture, which contrast with his noble, ringing tenor with just the right amount of squillo for ""America, Forever!"" Mr. Fedderly is just right as Goro, an absolute sleaze, decked out an overdone costume complete with bobbing kanmuri hat. As Sharpless, Dwayne Croft is a fine actor, although his once keen baritone sounds faded and dull.

When Butterfly's child is unveiled, the performance jumps to a higher energy level. Ms. Racette draws on new reserves of power as Butterfly's downward skid gets steeper. The fact that she is focusing all her maternal and musical energies on a puppet makes the scene even more moving and disturbing. The flawlessly sung flower duet with Suzuki acquires a demented, surreal aspect as the flowers are plucked from silent, black-clad stagehands. The image underscores the difference between Butterfly's forced optimism and the harsh reality of the final scene.

When Lt. Jerkwad (excuse me, Pinkerton) shows up with his wife in tow, the bottom drops out of Butterfly's heart. Ms. Racette sings the hollow realization with dark, dusky tones, undercut with terrible resolve as she sings her farewell to Suzuki. Patrick Summers is particularly good here, letting the silence speak for itself after leading two hours of stellar music in the orchestra pit. Finally, the anger and despair comes out as Butterfly chooses her honorable end. The ending is devastating in its power, as all performances of this great Puccini tragedy should be.",1303689600,2,3840,5.22564935064935
4336442,5,B004ECFW7Q,"This is quite simply one of the most moving opera DVDs I have ever seen.  Other reviewers have highlighted almost everything worthy of being highlighted so let me just say: Racette is vulnerable and convincing, the son/puppet so subtle you want to back up and watch him look another way again, the production incredibly striking from an artistic/visual point of view, so touching, so well composed and thought out.  I can watch this one again and again and still end with wonder and tears.",1301270400,4,489,4.809523809523809
4336443,4,B004ECFW7Q,"After purchasing two earlier DVDs of Butterfly, both of which were very disappointing as visual productions - this one finally succeeded.  Patricia Racette was wonderful as Butterfly - however - she came across (in my opinion) a little older than the way I usually visualize Butterfly, as did Maria Zifchak as Suzuki.  However, I soon looked beyond that as I heard their wonderful singing and saw their fine acting.  Giordani also gave a fine performance as Pinkerton.

The use of Japanese puppets and some interesting use of lanterns and interesting sets made it a very engaging performane.  It is a delightful production for this opera.",1299974400,,638,5.038095238095238

I have also seen the two from Verona (on video), but they only fall into the fair to good category. The karajan/Freni held up for the above mentioned time very well, despite slow conducting and a grainy picture. Still, if you don't like the new one, it is probably still tops on the video scene. Regarding the Butterfies, Racette outdid herself, and is very close to Freni in performance. The supporting cast is also very good. Also, some viewers complained about the puppet(s) being employed in the latter part of the Opera. If you were the director, who would you rely upon to carry out instructions, the puppeteers, or a three year old?  RCZ",1298246400,7,789,4.635714285714286

4336449,1,B004ECFW7Q,"I have always been a fan of the Metropolitan Opera and watch almost everything they put out> I also have become a fan of Mr Gelb. I think his insight is very good. I  also forgot that this was the production that Cristina Gallardo-Domas had to pull out of. Had I remembered that I would not have even purchased this dvd. Well I bought it and slipped into the player and by the end of act 1 I was in the state of shock. Never in my life have I heard such poor singing at the Met. Giordani's ill fitting costume made him look more like Sir John Falstaff instead of Lt. Pinkerton. But the looks are not so important it was the swooping to the high notes and then going flat that shocked me
I thought maybe he's really old so I looked him up and he's is only in his late 40's. To have vocal problems this early is tragic. Miss Racette was a substitute, so her performance should not be held against her. But when she went up for the High Note at the end of ancora un passo  I saw her mouth contort into that sad clown face and I said this isn't going to be good. The house singers were fabulous and I want to know why some young singers at the Met that probably know the role backwards and forwards could not have been given the chance of a lifetime? I'm sure that there are  flat performances every now and then,even at the Met but do we need to immortalize them into dvd's when they should have been quietly forgotten. There I said it.
