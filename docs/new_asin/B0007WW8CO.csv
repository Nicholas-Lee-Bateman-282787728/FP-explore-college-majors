8053069,5,B0007WW8CO,"I've been a diehard ""Digimon"" fan ever since I was either six, seven, or eight years old, and I love this DVD! This DVD has the first six episodes of the classic first season of ""Digimon"", such as the first episode, where the Digi-Destined Kids meet their Digimon, the episode where the kids and the Digimon find Devimon's Black Gears and try to stop them from controlling and turning good Digimon into evil ones, and the episode where the Digimon and the kids have to fight against a Black Gear-controlled Togemon ( giant teddy bear-like Digimon). All of those episodes lead to the rest of season one, which I hope will be made onto a non-bootleg DVD and released sometime in the future. Also, since this DVD has the first six episodes of the first season of ""Digimon"", the first episode introduces the Digi-Destined Kids, Ty, Izzy, and the rest, and their Digimon(Digimon stands for Digital Monsters), such as Motimon, Agumon, Patamon, Palmon, and the rest of the first Digimon, and some of their Digivolved forms, such as Motimon's: Tentomon and then Kabuterimon, Agumon's: Greymon and Wargreymon, and the rest of the original Digimon's Digivolved forms. I love and own this DVD and I can't wait to, hopefully, get more ""Digimon"" DVDs in the future! Finally, I think that ""Pokemon"" and ""Digimon"" are both awesome anime cartoons that I grew up with! (An interesting fact about ""Digimon"": Although ""Digimon"" is similar to ""Pokemon"" in some ways, ""Digimon"" was created a few years before ""Pokemon"" and thus, it probably aired on TV before it in Japan.)",1249603200,,1552,4.860377358490566
8053070,3,B0007WW8CO,Ok the american version is ment for kids and was totaly redone for kids in america.  If your an older person who is a fan. You might want to eather pirate the japanese version or go to japan and buy them.,1142640000,2,204,3.975609756097561
8053071,1,B0007WW8CO,"The orginal japanese version of Digimon was a very cool show.

unforutanately, when saban entertainment dubbed it in english, they decided they had to change ALL of the musical score, change all the characters names to make them american-like, and completely re-write the script to include extreamly lame diolog. the only things that are the same in the 2 versions is the animation and some sound effects.....OTHER THAN THAT ITS LIKE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOW

simply put, THE ENGLISH DUB SUCKS.

try and find the original japanese version. if u cant speak japanese, try to find a subtitled version (trust me, its better than this POS.).

COMPANIES LIKE SABAN, 4KIDS, DIC AND NELVANA SHOULD BE BANNED FROM LICENSING ANIME CAUSE THEY ALWAYS BUTCHURE IT!! enough said.",1135641600,11,768,5.071428571428571
8053072,5,B0007WW8CO,"I used to watch digimon many years ago. It was an awesome show, and a decent merchindise to back it up. At my school, people would always claim that Digimon was a Pokemon Rip-off. Thats not true at all.

Digimon has a more deeper story line. There are several themes on conflict not only between the forces of good and bad, but internal conflicts. All the episodes were linked together and progressed smoothly (unlike Pokemon where they had the same plot every episode was similar).

If you are a fan of Digimon, but haven't seen Season 1 yet, I strongly reccomend you to buy this DVD. Season 1 is by far the greatest season of Digimon. It's very dramatic (for a cartoon) and action packed.",1130544000,9,690,4.512
8053073,5,B0007WW8CO,"Many people often lable Digimon as a simple Pokemon clone when in fact it is much deeper. The characters (digi-destined) deal with real issues that normal adolescents face daily, all the while trying to save 2 worlds. This dvd introduces the series as it contains the first 7 episodes. I give this dvd 5 stars for the content alone (the quality of the dvd itself is superb). I guarantee once you put aside the ""kiddie"" fascade prejudice, you'll realize that this series is a jem.",1127606400,10,479,4.647058823529412
8053074,5,B0007WW8CO,"For years I have been searching and hoping that a new Digimon dvd would be released. Well my search is finally over thanks to Alliance Entertainment. After buying the Twentieth Century Fox Season 1 release back in 2001 (mind you, it was not the complete season 1...rather just random episodes), I was hoping some company would finally release Season 1 in ""order."" Well this disc does that and more. The disc contains the first 6 episodes of Season 1. The Video & Sound quality on the dvd are absolutely perfect. Unlike the 2001 release, the video quality wasn't compromised aka no pixelation. Here are the discs contents:

Episodes 1-6

1.""And So It Begins,""

2.""The Birth of Greymon,""

3.""Garurumon""

4.""Biyomon Gets Firepower,""

5.""Kabuterimon's Electro Shocker,""

6.""Togemon in Toy Town""

Extras Include

*Tai Bio and motion gallery

*Augumon Bio and motion gallery

*Matt Bio and motion gallery

*Gabumon Bio and motion gallery

*Original Japanese Ending

Ultimately this dvd is a dream come true for any Digimon fan as most consider season 1 as the best. Hopefully more volumes will follow in the future. I recommend this dvd for any animation collector as Digimon is one of the rare series that can be enjoyed by children and even adults. Truly a MUST HAVE DVD!",1112140800,40,1267,4.943127962085308
