3695358,1,B001MEJYAK,"In the realm of horror movies there is no paucity of lame, shallow, gratuitously violent flicks with characters acting so dumbly and irrationally as if they are racing to win the next Darwin's Award.. but I have got to say Martyrs manage to redefine the word ""lame movie"".
You have it all at the nth power.. victims with the common sense of a moth, blood splashing everywhere, assorted torture for every taste... and what makes it all the more irritating is the totally irrelevant, lame , dumb motivation for it all. I will just say one thing to the poor ignorant sadistic chap who came up with the brilliant idea for this movie: martyr means witness because it originally meant just that, a witness in a trial, and later also a witness of the faith or cause in which he believes. It has nothing to do whatsoever with witnessing life after death. Please, stop abusing culture  and history  besides sheer common sense).",1237766400,11,918,4.660493827160494
3695359,5,B001MEJYAK,"I freely admit I had dangerously high expectations going into this film, having read SO many positive reviews (and some rabidly negative ones as well -- as this is one of those love-it-or-loathe-it experiences), but I'm happy to say that, for me, 'Martyrs' lived up to every bit of the hype, and then some.

The problem is that, for most people, they are simply NOT going to be anticipating what this film actually IS, as opposed to what they've been led to BELIEVE it is. Namely, though it contains many ASPECTS typical of the genre, 'Martyrs' is NOT really a ""horror film"" in the usual sense.

Don't get me wrong, though -- the film certainly IS horrifying at times, on a number of different levels. And it has a kind of nightmare poetry which continues to haunt me.

'Martyrs' also manages to convey an overwhelming sense of cumulative dread and a hellishly pervasive sense of cold, heartless, systematically calculating evil. But it actually has a lot more in common with Gaspar Noe's uncompromising 'Irreversible' and the dark lyricism of Franju's 'Eyes Without A Face' than it does with films like 'Saw' or 'Hostel'.

For, while it does have some extremely disturbing violence and gore, it's somewhat less extreme in that respect than either 'High Tension' or 'Inside' -- two other notable examples of the new wave of French horror cinema.

But 'Martyrs' affected me far more than any of the above-named films (excepting 'Irreversible' and 'Eyes...' ), because of the IDEAS being dealt with and because of Pascal Laugier's remarkably artful handling of his material, aided tremendously by the harrowing, raw-nerved excellence of the acting, as well as the superb cinematography, editing, music, and make-up effects.

Indeed, 'Martyrs' is an ""art film"" in many ways. In fact, at a couple points it actually elicited tears from me -- not my typical response to most horror films -- as well as a few genuinely appalled exclamations of ""Oh my God... Oh my God..."", such was the level of my empathy and identification with the main characters and their ordeal.

In fact, it was this aspect of the film which enabled me to get past what would otherwise have been a big stumbling block for me, in terms of conventional movie logic -- i.e. the critical caveat of illogical behavior on the part of the characters when faced with a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation and NOT getting the hell OUT of there! In fact, at a very key point in the narrative, not only do the two main characters refuse to extricate themselves from a very risky and potentially dangerous locale, they positively LINGER there for what seems like DAYS!

Now, normally this would have had me crazy and screaming in frustration at the seeming stupidity or obtuseness of the characters. But, miraculously, in the case of 'Martyrs' I hardly even registered any of this because of the particular relationship dynamic of Lucie and Anna and their unique personal/psychological histories. In other words, given the very particular qualities of these two women, a specific case could be made for what would otherwise have seemed infuriatingly inappropriate behavior.

I find it both apt and reassuring that Laugier has referred to his film as the ""anti-'Funny Games'"", referencing Michael Haneke's deeply unpleasant, repellently grueling exercise in audience participation/endurance. For while 'Funny Games' was also not a horror film in the exploitative/commercial sense, neither did it have, for me, the inherent spiritual aspects or, dare I say, compassion, which make me willing to return to 'Martyrs', whereas I never feel myself eager to play more 'Funny Games'.

But, more than anything, 'Martyrs' lingers in my mind as a deeply sad, disturbing, and ultimately moving meditation on the theme of pain and transcendence. And though I can see many viewers recoiling from the experience, disgusted by its brutal savagery and depressed and offended by its seeming nihilism (with the emphasis on ""seeming""), I find that the film's intriguing ambiguities and moral questions make for a rich cinematic tapestry, reflective of both heaven and hell. And yet, paradoxically, it is perhaps the film's unnerving ability to convey a world of bottomless evil and merciless cruelty that kept me from giving 'Martyrs' a full five stars. Almost as though a part of me would feel guilty in doing this -- as if that would be akin to giving my implicit endorsement or tacit approval of the film's pitch-black heart of darkness.

Perhaps, Mr. Laugier, you did your job a bit TOO well!

Be that as it may, clearly this film has a lot more on its mind than simply grossing out or traumatizing its audiences, though it certainly managed that, as well, during some of its controversial festival screenings. Yet I would still hesitate to recommend it to most people I know. 'Martyrs' is, decidedly and emphatically, NOT a film for everyone.

But, for those looking to be challenged as well as shaken -- for those willing to be taken to deeply uncomfortable places and shown terrible things in new and unexpected ways -- for those yearning to FEEL a visceral response again after years of mindless, numbing ""movie-violence""... For all these people 'Martyrs' will be a welcome, if not necessarily pleasant experience, leaving them with something to actually THINK about once the end credits have rolled.

A very sad postscript to a very sad film:

Benoit Lestang, a close friend of the director, and the man who contributed the film's jaw-droppingly powerful special make-up effects, committed suicide shortly after the film's completion. He did get to see the film prior to his death and apparently was proud of his work and moved to tears by the film. As to the specific reasons for his tragic decision, little has been spoken or written about that. And, given the film's specific subject matter, one could all too easily be drawn into the temptation of making inappropriate connections and drawing conclusions, which I shall assiduously avoid.

Laugier himself has been very candid about his own personal feelings, both in regard to the emotional devastation of losing his friend, as well as the fact that the creative genesis of 'Martyrs' sprang from a long period of Laugier's own depression. And he has indicated that, in some ways, the film was perhaps his response to that depression -- partially expiating it through channeling his own darkness and pain into that of the film's theme and characters.

Suffice it to say, 'Martyrs' will provide a lasting and worthy final monument to Mr. Lestang's extraordinary gifts as a supremely talented artist and craftsman. And it is precisely that artistry, in conjunction with that of Laugier and the rest of his remarkable team, that resulted in startling images of strange and terrible beauty. Images which, like the film itself, continue to linger in the mind long after the final curtain.

Peace be with you, Benoit.",1237766400,251,6918,4.995655951346655

3695370,3,B001MEJYAK,"Summary:

As a movie, I give it 3/5 stars. Very well acted, story leaves something to be desired but well-paced and intriguing (especially the first 2/3 of the movie), and some scenes are just very very powerful and I thought was worth the experience. I said ""as a movie,"" because I know that certain fans of the genre would see this motivated by the torture scenes.

Blabbering review:

Okay, so the curiosity got the best of me and I finally came around to watching this today. In hindsight, I should have read about it less. My expectation that I would come away from the movie jaw-dropped and shaken up was.. completely unmet (not that I WANTED that to happen).

So, the impression I got before watching the movie was that this was visually at the most extreme end of the ""torture-porn"" genre, while managing genuinely psychologically disturbing (unlike B-movie gore-fests).

In the end, I'll agree that it's quite a disturbing movie, but it could have been so much better. As far as the torture-porn is concerned, I mean I have seen more blood and gore (of people still alive) in an episode of The Walking Dead. The final imagery I do have to say was quite something else. But that too, the most frightening aspect of it happens in the viewers heads rather than on screen.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

So, I said that this could have been so much better. These are the reasons why (please do share your thoughts too):

1) What makes Anna such a special person that she successfully becomes a martyr? I mean I doubt the ""organization"" randomly brought people in to see if they can be martyrs, at lease some sort of evaluation would have been made to identify who might succeed.. and they usually failed. So Anna must have been pretty darn special. Sure, she took Lucie in when nobody else would and she seems exceptionally compassionate. I do not see how that relates to what became of her. Basically, we were not given enough of Anna to build the expectation that, yeah, Anna could endure this.

2) The top-secret-clinical-dungeon-under-the-house trope.. I could have done without.

3) Movie ham-fists the introduction of ""the organization"" and their rationale for doing what they do in like 5 minutes. This is really where the movie lost me. I was like Uh-huh, you foreboding lady of apparent top-level position in a religious sect, whatever.",1488585600,,2343,4.7346437346437344

3695375,5,B001MEJYAK,"Lucie (Mylene Jamponoi) is a very traumatised young woman.  Fifteen years ago, as a child she narrowly escaped the clutches of sadistic abductors.  Now grown, she arrives at a rural family home - presumably the home of her former tormentors - and opens up a full out assault.  Later joined by longtime friend Anna (Marjana Alaoui), the two begin to explore what secrets the house holds.  Once you've made it this far into the movie, you may be surprised to know that the really intense horror isn't done but is just beginning.  The house does indeed hold a few surprises, and they may not be what one expects.  Martyrs combines the extremism and vibe of movies like The Killing Gene and the Saw saga with a large dose of haunting, thought-provoking and weird concept horror as it makes its way towards its genuinely shocking final minutes.  Martyrs is a horror movie almost exclusively for die-hard horror fans; if you're a newbie to the genre welcome, and there's tonnes of great films out there waiting for you, but you may want to put off this particular horror movie until you've seen some others and are somewhat insulated from the truly horrifying sadism of Martyrs.  It manages to be one of the most violent movies out there while still leaving the viewer with the jarring knowledge that even worse is taking place offscreen.  That's quite a feat considering the graphic nature of the movie: often times the victims don't even look like human beings, more like moving masses of scar tissue.  It does all this while taking some unexpected psychological and metaphysical twists and turns.  Wholeheartedly recommended for horror fans, but newcomers may wish to proceed with caution.",1478217600,,1686,4.86013986013986

3695397,5,B001MEJYAK,"Nine Things About the Film ""Martyrs""

1. One of the best horror movies ever made, this film is considered part of the French New Extremity movement. It's a masterpiece that takes no prisoners, and is on almost every critic's list of most disturbing horror films.

2. This movie is savage in every sense of the word. It's also extremely divisive - people love it or hate it.

3. The movie combines supernatural horror, psychological horror... and the absolute pinnacle of torture porn.

4. The movie starts with a traumatized girl running screaming through the streets. That's the happiest part of the whole movie.

5. Without giving too much away, the main plot is about a girl named Lucie who survived extreme child abuse. She becomes best friends with a girl named Anna, who wants to help Lucie heal. Things don't go the way Anna planned.

6. There are hardly any men in the movie. The few male characters that do appear are not nice. But it is noted several times in the movie that this is not about rape. There is no sexual abuse in the entire film.

7. The movie directly challenges religion and faith at the deepest, most fundamental level. This makes a lot of people uncomfortable, if not downright angry.

8. The sadism in this movie is something only the French can approach. America doesn't have the guts to make a movie like this (even though they tried).

9. If you are wondering whether you should watch this movie or not, that means you probably shouldn't. It's not a film for casual or beginning horror fans. It's a philosophically devastating, existential atom bomb that calls into question the very purpose of existence.",1440720000,5,1637,4.71578947368421

I thought it combines a good story, along with loads of grisly and gory stuff to make it a really well crafted film. A lot of the film takes place indoors, it may considered depressing, and the directing and acting are both very good; it's well made exploitation. It isn't slow and delivers some nasty shotgun blasting within the first 15 minutes. For a little over an hour, it deals with stuff like razor slashes, brutal murders, a disturbing and grotesque looking woman who is barely clothed and covered in slash marks and is insane, and plentiful amounts of gore; the practical gore effects are excellent. It then turns into a brutal torture film, at over the one hour mark into the film, that's far more extreme than anything in the SAW movies. If you want sex and nudity it doesn't deliver, as only some topless stuff is shown. It has a dismal atmospheric type quality in many parts, and there isn't anything really nice to look at. It's a really grim and graphic for those who are looking for serious and disturbing horror that's also well made.

You get a directors into, teaser, a trailer and a making of the film for extras. The quality on this standard DVD is very good.",1431043200,4,1294,4.577586206896552

The sheer torture techniques in this movie reflect back to a war type torture, as they slowly break your spirit in a philosphical way. So one may stay in the material world and transcend into the other world as well. This movie is one of the goriest I have seen in a while; it has an interesting view on the point that the atagonists portray.

At first the initial response is to pray for the victims, but I almost feel more pity for the people who are so broken and wicked that they enjoy all this S&M crap that is a part of this dark hearted culture. It is like they are mortgaging a few fleeting years for an eternity lost. Abuse is a horrible sickness that Jesus knew to well and I wouldn't want to be the most powerful Mafioso, human trafficker, occult practitioner, or corrupt government official when the wrath of the lamb takes place.

It does not come anywhere near Hostel, which had a sick plot and was interesting.

3695453,5,B001MEJYAK,"Let me start off by saying that this film contains some of the most graphic and brutal content  I have ever seen since the slave movie "" Goodbye Uncle Tom "" which by the way I emplore you to go and watch. The film "" Martyrs "" It is not for the faint of heart. But if you can look through the layers of brutality, what you will see is an extremely powerful and profound spiritual message, one of the most profound and pronounced ever in a movie. It was somewhat the same message that was delivered in the Movie "" Fight club ' and also the ending of the movie "" The Messenger: The story of Joan of arc "" with Milla Javovich. I am not condoning the torture of anything. But I totally understand the message the makers of this movie was trying to relay to the audience. Trying to find a human being in this day and age or a Modern day "" Christ/ A Martyr "" who has the ability to endure what appears to be a moment or life of endless pain and suffering without psychologically, emotionally or physically breaking down. The characters Lucie and her friend Ana represents two types of Hue-man. A Martyr, one who has the ability and the willingness to endure, perservere in extreme pain and suffering whether for themselves or for others without the expectation of any reward or Blessing. The other a non Martyr who does not have the ability, resolve or the vision to see the necessity of suffering and will most likely have a physical, psychological or emotional break down if faced with prolonged pain and/or suffering. One last thing I want to mention. This movie exemplifies the power of "" Letting Go "". We spend our entire lives putting up defense mechanisms because we are afraid to endure, we are afraid of pain and suffering and therefore are emotionally, spiritually and psychologically "" Blocked "". The pain and suffering only exist because like Lucie we're trying to hold on to things that are not permanent and are therefore not able to adapt and change when face with life's different circumstances that requires us to do so. We must be like  Ana who finally realized , the pain and suffering ends when we decide to let go. Excellent movie Five stars Easy !!!!!!",1425254400,2,2167,4.46969696969697

3695475,5,B001MEJYAK,Great movie,1424476800,,11,5.0
3695476,5,B001MEJYAK,"Making any type of a movie is a formidable challenge, but I always felt that the horror genre carried an extra burden on its shoulders. Not to say they don't get made. They do. Many many many of them, and to be blunt, most of them are crap. Some are victims of bad production values, poor acting, and even worse writing. Others aspire to be something more, but are competing in a field where seemingly everything has been done, and an audience even halfway knowledgeable can see what's coming every step of the way. This is often combined with a misunderstanding by the filmmakers on what effective horror actually is, and how it works.

""Martyrs"" is one of those very rare horror films that manages to get everything right. The makers of this nightmare have an EXTREMELY good understanding of what horror is and how it works. The writing, acting, directing, and special effects all come together like clockwork to present something truly original. The plot developments of this movie cannot be anticipated. The experience begins as one thing, rapidly shifts gears, and then becomes something else entirely, just when the audience is beginning to get a footing in this twisted little landscape. The violence is graphic, brutal, and relentless. The relentless aspect is always a gamble in that the risk is run of desensitizing the audience, but that isn't the case here. If anything, one's sensitivity to the unfolding carnage actually seems to increase. Perhaps most remarkably, it's genuinely thought-provoking. It's images and ideas have a way of haunting the viewer long after the story has concluded, and I found myself feeling a deep and genuine sadness for the two primary characters. They are sympathetic, entirely believable, and ensnared in tragic circumstances far beyond their control and understanding.

Those who have read this far will note that I have said absolutely nothing about what this film is actually about. If this currently summarizes your knowledge of the story, try and keep it that way. Trust me. Don't even read the promotional blurb on the back of the DVD box. The less you know, the more of an impact this masterpiece is going to have on your psyche. That isn't necessarily a good thing, because this horror offering is the real deal. It intends to shock and disturb, and it does. Does it ever.",1424131200,2,2325,4.898477157360406

3695510,3,B001MEJYAK,I watched the directors comments before the film started.  He apologizes on more than one occasion for what you're about to see.  I wasn't sure what he meant.  At a point I thought I had things figured out early on in the movie.  But I think that was the point.  To mislead the viewer.  What happened next I never would have expected.  In the end it left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Only certain characters experience resolution in this film...not the viewer.  Personally at the end of the film I felt a void that made me question humanity...or lack there of.  This movie will leave you speechless in the end and keep you thinking for days afterwards.  Don't get too attached to any characters.  If you like gore for the sake of gore this one will be up your ally.  I wanted to give this film four starts but I just couldn't do it.

Matter of fact if my daughter didn`t want to see the end so bad I would have turned it off way before the end. This is a extremely brutal movie that shows severe beating to a young girl that is just to over the top for me. It is extremely realistic. The beating alone will make most even Horror fans turn the movie off. This is not a horror movie in the traditional sense but it is horrific.

Lucie and Anna are inseparable. They met as children in an orphanage and became fast friends. Lucie was horribly abused before this and still experiences attacks by an emaciated creature. Anna was also a victim of child abuse and she works to protect and support Lucie. Fast forward fifteen years, and Lucie kills an entire family with a shotgun because she believes they were the ones who abused her. Anna is understandably shocked by the news. She has her doubts that Lucie killed the right people, but frantically tries to bury the bodies anyway. After finding a hidden room that leads to an underground torture chamber, Anna is plunged into a bizarre world of torture, agony, and transcendence.

I have conflicted feelings about Martyrs because it feels like two disparate films stuck together. The first one is focused on Anna and Lucie's relationship. At the orphanage, their relationship dynamic was created where Anna is Lucie's strength and protects her from others and herself. Unfortunately, Lucie is beyond the help Anna provides. No amount of love or compassion can stop the violent hallucinations accompanied by Lucie's extreme self mutilation and other breaks with reality. These episodes started after the abuse and never stopped. I can understand Anna's urge to help and protect Lucie, but cleaning up her mass murder and acting like it's ok is a bit extreme. Keeping Lucie's severe problems secret may make her happy in the short term, but actively keeping her from authority figures who can actually help her creates the toxic circle of codependency and destruction. This relationship dynamic is rooted in reality. Plenty of people find themselves in relationships with those like Lucie who will harm and eventualy destroy them. Their love for that person makes it impossible to turn away and abandon them. Lucie and Anna's relationship ends when Lucie realizes that nothing can stop her hallucinations and she kills herself. I would have liked to seen entire film about these two women's relationship. We only get to see a small sliver it and then fifteen years are skipped over. Why didn't Lucie get the mental health services she obviously needed? Why does Anna's mother hate Lucie? This part of the film is underdeveloped and unfortunately the part I found the most interesting.

The second film is about a twisted organization that tortures young women in an effort to get them to a state of transcendence, allowing the members to find out what is after death. It starts when Anna finds a hidden torture room and attempts to save the horribly scarred chained woman she finds there. It reflects her relationship with Lucie because this woman is beyond help, but Anna can't turn away. This effort is futile because the woman is too psychologically damaged to realize Anna is trying to help her. Because she stayed in the house trying to save the woman, the goon squad from the organization captured her and put her in the torture room to hopefully get her to transcend. Thematically, this part is solid. An aging woman heads the organization and sacrifices young woman after young woman to essentially feel better about her own mortality. It's an older generation destroying the younger generation to continue their agency and power. In actual practice, it's kind of boring. The organization is explained by the leader, followed by a seemingly interminable torture scene. After a while, it just gets dull and takes up way too much of the film. It ends when Anna is skinned alive and magically survives the procedure. This scene is surprising and shocking, but ruined by the fact that Anna would have died of shock, blood loss, or infection before she ever got close to her moment of transcendence. I just couldn't maintain the suspension of disbelief needed for it to be truly effective and the ending fell flat for me as a result.

Martyrs is undeniably a unique film that tries to tackle deeper issues to ascend about the torture porn genre. Unfortunately, the film is really two not very well developed ideas trying to be one. I would have loved to see more of Lucie and Anna's relationship and how it developed over time. The second half depends too much on the repetitive, mind-numbing torture that is essentially wasted space. The ending is beyond ridiculous. The film unfortunately falls short for me. The performances are amazing, especially Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi who make Anna and Lucie's relationship intensely interesting with very little development. The cinematography makes even extreme gore and blood look artfully beautiful. I would urge fans of more extreme horror to watch it at least once, but others would probably do well to avoid this one.",1393545600,,4710,4.980940279542566

This movie is a movie that I own and I own very few.

3695657,5,B001MEJYAK,"What an experience. I'm a big horror fan and am happy watching and enjoying 'popcorn' slasher movies for what they are but really the genre is crying out for more pictures that truly assault the senses.

The French are particularly adept at painting bleak, unforgiving landscapes as well as thrusting you right into the action but rarely have I experienced anything quite so memorable as Martyrs.

Comparisons will (and have) been drawn with Hostel, Saw, Hellraiser and others but this is really rather misleading. Further comparisons have been drawn with Inside, Frontiers, Funny Games etc. and while slightly more credible in that atmosphere and psychology play a far greater part, none come close to Martyrs.

I'd challenge anyone not to be affected by this movie. It's gory, but you won't laugh. It's shocking, but you won't be able to look away. 24 hours later it's still running through my mind and if I see a better horror movie than this this year, I'll be truly amazed.

As much as I'd love to write more this is most certainly a film you should watch knowing as little as possible. Suffice to say the acting, cinematography, score, atmosphere and unbridled tension combine to create one of the most engaging films in this genre of the last two decades.

Watch it. Recommend it (it won't be easy) and let's hope Martyrs gets the credit it deserves.",1389398400,14,1357,4.8068669527897

3695679,4,B001MEJYAK,"Where does one begin when trying to explain a film like ""Martyrs"" without giving away major spoilers?

In the opening shot, a young girl, Lucie, is seen running for her life. She is clearly traumatized and appears to have been abused. Lucie (who is portrayed by Mylne Jampano as an adult) is taken to an orphanage and is discovered she had experienced years of physical abuse although there are no signs of it being sexual. At the orphanage, Lucie befriends another troubled girl, Anna (portrayed by Morjana Alaoui as an adult). Fifteen years later, Lucie, who is still severely scarred from her childhood experience decides to take revenge on the people who abused her and one day she storms in to the home of her alleged perpetrators armed with a shotgun and a mind full of vengeance. When Anna is summoned by Lucie for help, Anna's world takes a drastic turn and the minute she steps foot inside that house, she is one step closer to becoming ... a ...?

""Martyrs"" is indeed a rare horror film. It is not the only film in the genre to display shocking scenes of human depravity and human suffering and outlandish gore but somehow it stands out amongst the many in the unpleasant torture genre. The film has multiple layers. Just when you think you know where the story is going, it takes a steep turn, and just when you think you have it figured out again ... nope, there is yet another turn and despite the outrageousness depicted on screen, the characters, specifically the 2 female leads, are fleshed out enough and likeable enough that we are totally immersed in their story and their survival and it makes their on screen misery that much harder to watch. The performances from the 2 female leads is riveting. Both Jampano and Alaoui show strong, gut wrenching emotions, never losing focus and the film's tone is consistently dark. So much so that there is very little room for humor here and even the 2 leading actresses' obvious physical beauty takes a back seat to the absolute brutality taking place on screen. This film is an overwhelming and brutal showcase of how ugly and visceral life can be for some and how rarely, is life's journey a pleasant one. Not to mention how destructive and diabolical man can be. The film is outrageous, however when reading about missing women who have been held captive for years, the most recent case involving the 3 missing woman in Cleveland, you come to the realization that this type of monstrous evil does exist and makes these types of film far more frightening than those slasher flicks with a walking dead killer holding a machete as the villian.

I have to admit that I read most of the reviews of this film. Considering its reputation, I felt I really needed to prepare myself for what I was going to watch and although I do not recommend this approach to all, I am really glad I did. I went into this expecting hell on screen, and although what I got out of it met my expectations, I did expect far worse so it lessened the punch. I guess the point of this is, if you go in expecting more, you may end up not being totally blind-sided by the disturbing images displayed and like some reviewers noted, you really have to be in the mood for this piece as it digs really deep into the darker side of the human condition.

Did I enjoy this film? I guess ... maybe? ""Enjoy"" is not an appropriate word here since no one can really claim they enjoy watching the suffering of others. I watch horror films because I like venturing into the darker side of things, I like exploring the unknown and unraveling mysteries and sometimes I want to be sucker punched. However after the light comes back on in a darkened movie theatre, or I turn off my DVD/BluRay after watching a horror film, with the exception of a few, most don't usually linger at the back of my mind for countless hours or days after viewing or leave me questioning the sheer brutality of man. This film did so I guess it is safe to state the film did its job. It is not for everyone but for those who want to witness something out of the ordinary, even by horror standards, and have a high tolerance for on-screen violence and torture, ""Martyrs"" is recommended but be warned, you may not be prepared to handle the tale it tells.

3695699,1,B001MEJYAK,"I am so ashamed of myself. I have a 3 digit IQ but still fell for the old film company writing there own propaganda as the first reviews and then publishing them as if they were the public who had watched the movie. This movie didn't cause even the slightest ripple in my nerves or mind. It didn't bother me, upset me or disturb me for months as they claimed. They actually wrote over and over in at least a dozen company reviews that I read that it is the most disturbing movie ever made. I went over all the reviews again and realized that they all sound the same, what a dummy I am. They all start out with, ""well I'm not going to give away the plot or spoilers but this is seriously the most disturbing movie ever, still bothers me six months later. WHAT!!!! PLEASE!!!! They even made references to the movie,"" hostel ""while trying to make one believe the torture scenes are bearable if you can handle the torture scenes in, ' Hostel ', which are very graphic. Well guess what THERE ARE NO ACTUAL TORTURE SCENES, JUST IMPLIED unless you consider being chained up and punched in the stomach 7 or 8 times torture. Unlike all the studio execs who wrote the propaganda,  I am going to tell you the plot . It's about a bunch of old geezers who have decided that they can't die unless they have proof of life after death so one old nut decides that  the best way to accomplish this is by kidnapping little children and torturing them until they see God and then the little tykes can tell the old geezers what heavens all about. Living Martyrs so to speak. It's nuts to know that to be martyred one has to be dead in the first place. The movie actually plays out like 2  separate short screenplays shoved together with some of the dumbest filler I have ever seen in a very transparent attempt to link what I consider 2 separate short stories into a complete movie  I have to admit that the first short,  that I could call, ' Lucia's revenge ', was very well done and very exciting to watch,  this is the only good part of the movie where one watching feels justified, it takes place 15 years after Lucia escaped from the clutches of her kidnappers. She tracks them down  and goes to their house with a shotgun, rings the doorbell and without hesitation blows away one by one every one in the house including blowing the heads off the children as they ate cereal mixed with a little bit of brain matter and she does it with the same sense of mercy that they showed her when she was 8 years old. The filler is absolutely unrealistic and just plain too stupid to believe. After Lucia blows the entire family  away and then takes her own life. Her friend instead of leaving right  away, she decided it's better to stay at some strangers house  with all the dead bodies for three or four days, just long enough for the old geezers to show up and capture her. This was so corny to me that it reminded me of the coed, ax murderer movies like one I just had the displeasure of watching were in one scene a coed is screaming running around the house with the axe murderer hot  on her trail, the coed turns a corner and starts screaming  louder because on the floor in front of her is the dead body of her friend, a dead friend who just happened to have a loaded 38 revolver in her cold dead hand . Now this is the part that reminds me of the filler used in, ' Martyr's' . The coed instead of picking up the loaded pistol and blowing away the axe murderer decides it's safer to start screaming even louder and takes off running around the house again. Come on guys you can do better than this. This is the kind of filler that the, Martyr's screenwriter thought was sufficient to tie one great short story with a lesser second short. Dumb, just dumb. But my guess is that all the 14 to 17 year olds are going to love this movie. Their is no deep or subtle spiritual meaning here as their reviews like you to believe, just a guy short on words and ideas when he wrote this screenplay.",1381881600,5,3969,4.270306258322237

I personally love French ""horror"". It explores the human mind more than the sheer need to see blood and guts and gore. If you like a thrill and a thinker in one, definitely get this movie.",1378339200,2,792,4.697841726618705
3695703,3,B001MEJYAK,"I was recommended this movie along with ""Inside"" I watched Inside first. It was stupid. So my expectations for this one was not too high. I have to say. I' glad they proved me wrong. This movie, unlike Inside, actually has a plot. It's about a girl named Lucie who was being tortured and she escaped. She was then place into an orphanage where she meets Anna and the two become best friends (with one wanting more). years later Lucie tracks down the people responsible and well, things doesn't end too happy for them.

I won't spoil much but the movie was very good, the acting was top notch. The pacing was good. It kept us interested for a long time. No one was falling asleep on this one.

However, this movie does suffer its problems. It makes characters do stupid things to push the plot along. For example, One girl wanted to hurry up and leave the house, yet after certain events she just lingers and lingers and lingers because the plot needs her to stay.

The last maybe 30 mins of the movie was a nightmare, but not the good or scary kind. it was boring as hell and went on for far too long. We didn't need it, it was pointless, it was trying to make a statement that was stupid. It's like I was watching a bunch of filler crap. And honestly, the whole ""it's an organization"" plot shock isn't much of a shock when the reason behind this ""organization"" is retarded. it's like the last 30 mins tried to be Hostel but was too afraid to just take the idea so they had to come up with their own excuse for this organization which was not nearly as good or even well thought out as Hostel. We were all sitting there going ""Really? That's what this is about?"" Honestly, before the last 30 minutes I was ready to give it five stars but those last minutes that dragged on and freaking on with pretentious religious babble and torture was mind numbing. The person who recommended this movie claimed people walked out the screening cause they were so affected by what they saw but honestly I think they walked out ont he last 30 mins of this movie cause it freaking sucked.",1378080000,,2072,4.362694300518135
3695704,5,B001MEJYAK,"Pain and transcendence paint the theme of this intense, cruel, relentlessly brutal film that will lead you to dark places free from the moral burdens of compassion.

Other Amazon reviews offer a friendly piece of advice: ""Avoid, if you can, reading anything about Martyrs before viewing--this ultra-intense Canadian-French shocker benefits from discovering its horrors cold.""  I followed that advice.  I haven't even seen a trailer.  What follows is my account of this film which was revered by some as being among the ""10 most disturbing horror movies"" and by Amazon as only advisable to ""the most hardcore patrons of 21st-century torture cinema.""  I find over-hyping to be symptomatic of the breeding grounds of mediocrity.  Does this film follow suit?  No.  Does it break free from the over-played mold?  ABSOLUTELY!  So I suggest you STOP READING THIS REVIEW UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE.

We are introduced to an underage Lucie escaping an abandoned building where she was kept captive, beaten and malnourished under destitute conditions presumably as a sex slave.  Lucie ages through adolescence exhibiting damaged antisocial tendencies and self-destructive proclivities.  15 years later, Lucie (Mylne Jampano; Hereafter) pays a visit to her to childhood captors.  She finds revenge, but no true satisfaction; only utter mental breakdown exacerbated by her surrogate tormentor, her demon-like anthropomorphized self-loathing and guilt.  Anna (Morjana Alaoui) has been watching out for Lucie since they met in an orphanage.  She arrives at the scene of Lucie's revenge.  It's bad.  Really bad.  And Anna tries to help clean up the mess and keep Lucie out of trouble.

Just when you thought you knew where the story was going, another weird story arc falls in your lap...over and over again.  This film is beyond bonkers, but executed intelligently.  You find yourself caught between wanting to laugh at how senseless it all is and wanting to scream because it's frustratingly insane.  But, by the end, everything feels well-linked together in hindsight; in fact, brilliantly so.

This film is rich in gore, visceral brutality, intensity, violence (against women; not sexual in nature), torture and desperation.  There is also a fair bit of nudity.  But it is presented more to embrace humility and vulnerability than perversion.  Artfully handled, the nudity is an effective device that will elicit many feelings, none of which being arousal.

Pascal Laugier, the man to blame for The Tall Man (2012), wrote and directed this film.  The Tall Man was an indecisively written film featuring an unreliable story, making for an unsatisfying waste of time drowning itself in too many loose plot elements.  Did that happen here?  Well...sort of but not really.  Yes in the sense of the complete plot-based pandemonium, but which somehow neatly tied together in the end.  No in the sense that I actually LOVED this film--whereas I hated The Tall Man.

Organized madness best describes Laughier's storytelling style.  If you crave brutal intensity, let this film impress you.",1377993600,7,3080,5.2804123711340205

3695706,5,B001MEJYAK,"A champion swimmer and her family are having a quiet meal when someone tries to break into their house. The story  is comparatively straightforward, but there are several flashbacks and nightmares, many of them ugly, and enough different focuses of action to make this movie seem really varied. If you can concentrate on it for 90m or so and keep telling yourself that it's only a film, it's quite possible you will enjoy it because it is so well made and substantial. The three young female leads are very attractive, and one of them physically exploits the camera expertly during scenes which must have been very hard to play. The villains and heroes are eventually very well defined, and the action is extremely gory and jarring, so much so that if you are sqeamish some scenes may make you feel sick. It is not as violent as The Hills Have Eyes but it is much scarier, and could have been made even worse if the makers had decided to show a key scene onscreen. As a result I am not entirely convinced that the film makers were paying close attention during their How To Frighten An Audience course.  You will want to leave several days between viewings of this extreme film, but repeated showings do get rewarded. The best print has the faces at the very top with the title in red letters on the front cover, and Eurocult Uncut on the back cover. The brief yellow English subtitles disappear quickly from the screen and do not get in the way. 16/9.",1376611200,4,1452,4.538167938931298
3695707,5,B001MEJYAK,"Making its Stateside debut, Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films. ""Martyrs"" however, is not like a ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" in which there are creative forms of torture served for your viewing pleasure, this film has an art house feel to it that leads into the bowels of depravity. It's demonstrates how evil man can be for the share pleasure of scientific research. It reminded me of a brochure that I received depicting the horrors of how animals are slaughtered for human consumption. If that is a brochure you'd rather not digest before dinner, ""Martyrs"" is the type of film you may not want to view on a full stomach. Brilliantly executed in ways better described only as experimental, Pascal Laugier takes us to the end of the tunnel, the last stop, to a place where there is no longer any separation between humans and animals, predators or prey, it' a place so dark, you will no longer have to imagine for now it has been recorded on celluloid. All the ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" or any other torture porn created to date has nothing on ""Martyrs"". Why? Because they French know their cinema business like no other. They leave nothing up to the imagination and nothing is too taboo for them whereas here in America, filmmakers tend to like to draw certain lines when it comes to making horror films for shock value. ""Martyrs"" is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival, as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay & lesbian festival alike. It covers the gamut in storytelling and that is what makes this film so powerful and so inherently haunting ,it will carve many putrid memories in your phsyque long after viewing. I would not recommend this film to folks with weak stomachs.",1376352000,,1775,4.674121405750799

Based on what I'd read about the film, I was actually afraid to watch it.  I didn't want it to be one of those films you wish you could ""unsee.""  In my humble opinion, it was handled with great care and I didn't feel that there was  ever ""too much.""  Likes:  original, likable main characters (I actually cared about them), genuinely frightening, powerful, thought-provoking (had a long conversation w/ my friend afterward), GREAT effects, GREAT story, and in general, just a way better film than I thought it would be and I had pretty high expectations going in.

It is extreme--maybe the most extreme movie I have watched, and there is not one time the viewer can relax and sit back to enjoy.  The film is very sick, but it does have an objective: who can endure pain more, men or woman? Can women survive torture beyond belief (beatings, skinning, and other horrors)?

3695733,5,B001MEJYAK,"I thought it was excellently done in terms of direction, cinematography, storyline, script, acting, and production.  But this is a hard film to get through - both for the violence in the first half, and the truly uncomfortable torture sequences in the second half.  I thought it was an extremely well-done and original film, but it's definitely not for everyone.  Both of the lead actresses ( Morjana Alaoui, Mylne Jampano) were fantastic, as were the supporting cast.  But I would not recommend this for anyone who doesn't have an extremely strong moral constitution - it stays with you for a long time (think of Videodrome X 10).  Very bleak, and very gut-wrenching, but outstanding film if you can tolerate this kind of thing.  Think long and hard before you order this one - but if you do decide to order it, you won't be disappointed.",1373500800,4,839,4.751724137931035
3695734,1,B001MEJYAK,"""Martyrs"" is a 2008 French horror film about a young woman named Anna attempting to help her childhood best friend, a disturbed woman named Lucie who, as a child, escaped from a group of unknown people who were torturing her mercilessly. 15 years after her escape, Lucie has found the home of a seemingly average family and sets forth attacking them, insisting they were the ones who had held her prisoner and tortured her. When Anna shows up and is horrified by what Lucie has done to the family, she soon gets caught up in the mysterious truth of Lucie's nightmarish existence and finds herself suffering far more than even Lucie had.

This is one of those times you say, ""I just saw a seriously messed up movie,... and I'm not sure I'm glad I did."" I have never seen misogyny in filmmaking like this. That's not the ""idea"" of the movie, and maybe it wasn't even the feeling behind it, but it was the impression that comes across. Never has the term ""torture porn"" seemed so appropriate. This is literally a lot of horrific torture of women with a very simple conspiracy plot around it. Now, normally, that conspiracy plot would be enough to make it interesting for me, though I am not the type of horror fan big on gore and torture. I will admit, I like the ""Hostel"" films a lot (well, I`ve seen 1 and 2, I don't know if there are more). The idea behind them is horrific, yet they also are engaging characters and stories. The storytelling here is so thin, since watching the graphic torture really seems to be what this experience is about, and I just don't get that, myself. Is it well done? Yes, in terms of effects and all. However, it is a detestable viewing experience. Look, I've even seen ""A Serbian Film"", which I thought was the worst thing I'd ever seen. It's been a while since I've seen that one, and there are concepts in that one that, yes, are.. at least equally disturbing, but there is also something cartoony about that film. Maybe it's just so ridiculous. And still, it was a more interesting plot, too. This film, it is just a ton of graphic and horrible violence, some of the worst I've ever seen, with not enough of a plot to make it worthwhile. I've seen this film on web-lists of movies you ""Have to see but will never want to watch again,"" but honestly, there is no reason you have to see this. There are better conspiracy horror films out there that are more fun to watch. Heck, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is more enjoyable in that respect, say what you will about it. There's just no pleasure in this sort of ""entertainment"" for me, and I'd be concerned about anyone who enjoyed watching this.

However, if you must own a copy of this, my review is for the DVD ""Unrated"" version. Though, my copy has a different cover image, but maybe that's a slip-cover I didn't receive.

Its not the gore that makes this movie stand alone, its the plot, acting, directing n most of all the subject matter. The story is truly humanity at its worst.

If your overly sensative or have had a traumatic experience involving abuse I do not recommend this movie. I am a horror, true crime n thriller buff n this movie is in a class all its own.

I bought this on a recommendation with the warning that, while it was a good movie, it was hard to watch.
I was not lied to.

This IS a well made film with a compelling story. It lost me on a couple of points but not enough to detract from the whole movie.
  The brutality is uncomprimising. I thought I was jaded to excesses in violent movies but I've met my match. Perhaps my tastes have matured, been elevated or I've softened - whatever.
I may not have ""liked"" the unfolding and building brutality, but that 'fault' lies with me, not what was finally produced by the film makers.

Somewhere beyond the darkest depths of Hell lies MARTYRS, a film of such unspeakable horror that it becomes unbearable to watch. It is not that the film is shocking, graphic, or repulsive, but that it is all of these things taken in the extreme. MARTYRS rapes the senses and apologizes for nothing. It begs the questions: Why? Is this art? Who could have conceived this? What is there to gain in the making of this film? You continue watching as things go from bad to worse to worse to worse, until finally you realize that this film was not meant to entertain. In fact, it probably wasn't meant for human consumption. It only exists because it had to. What makes MARTYRS that much more unacceptable is how well the film is made. MARTYRS is well cast, well shot, and very well acted. The visceral screen violence is ultra-realistic, and nauseating at that. Pascal Laugier reduces his characters to a level far below humanity. The man is a genius, but he is also wildly insane. Once you have seen MARTYRS, you cannot unsee it, so prepare yourself. Things will get ugly.

Knowing as little as possible is important here.  As such, I'll focus on what it is in a broad sense and not what it consists of. I'm going to write in short sentences to avoid revealing anything about the story.

Martyrs is a character-driven story and deeply personal.  Violence is not especially prevalent, but when they do use violence it is for a specific purpose and it happens to characters you will likely care about.  The tone is absolute despair and it evoked a great amount of empathy from me.  The directing style is very intimate and professional.  The cinematography is beautiful: stark, clean, and perfectly suited.  The set design is unique and the talent used in creating these locations greatly contributes to the film's ability to linger in my mind.

3695834,5,B001MEJYAK,"Whenever I've mentioned this movie to my friends I've always told them that ""I've seen it, I love it, and I would never watch it again."" I'm more then willing to lend them the DVD, but I won't watch it with them. I've been a horror fan for years, and when you love the genre enough to step outside of the American schlockfests that get wheeled into theaters it's a delight to find the trends that are occurring in foreign horror. I'm not entirely sure why France has lent itself to such good horror, but the French New Wave is like a graduate school for those sick of the tedium of Paranormal Activity and Saw, willing to redefine the limits of horror in a truly inspired and creative way unlike the dull nihilistic extremism of something like The Human Centipede films. A lot of people cite High Tension, Frontier(s), Inside, and Martyrs as the hallmarks of the genre, and for the most part this is true. Martyrs is different because more than all the others it is an endurance test of a film, and while it could absolutely be categorized as so-called ""torture porn"" it chooses to use the conventions of the genre to enhance the structure of the film rather than wallow around in gore (although there is plenty of that).

  Its really difficult to proceed much farther in the review without dancing into some kind of spoiler, but I assure you that I will stick to plot events that occur in the first ten minutes of the film. We have Lucie, a young girl who was violently tortured for weeks as a child who managed to escape but is pursued by a mysterious demonic creature who seems to want to inflict pain upon her. Years later Lucie believes that she has found those people who were responsible for her torture and bursts into their house with a shotgun, killing a couple and their son and daughter. She then calls her childhood friend Anna, who is panicked that Lucie might have found the wrong people, to come help her. That's as far as I can go, and I believe that its all the information that you should have going into the film (if you're curious enough to look up the trailer on Youtube, don't, it spoils everything and makes the movie look like its something that it's not).

  Director Pascal Laugier approaches his material with relentless, cold efficiency and interlaces his plot with a sense of real mystery that is intoxicating as a viewer. Even at the film's most harrowing points, when you have to look away from the screen (if this honestly doesn't happen for you, see a psychiatrist), you can sense that the scene has a purpose and you find yourself saying ""it'll be over in a minute, I have to see what comes next."" Every character has a motivation that is understandable on some level (even some sick levels), every actor enlisted performs their job in a masterful way (especially Catherine Begin, who's midpoint monologue is among the most chilling in cinema) and nobody is simply evil for evil's sake. In the film's second half the plot takes on philosophical overtones, which climax in a gut-wrenching ending that left me staring at the credits trying to collect myself for a good five minutes.

  I don't have nightmares from slasher movies anymore. Jason and Leatherface can brandish as many knives and chainsaws as they want and I'll usually just eat popcorn and forget about it once I leave the theater. I had nightmares after watching Martyrs. It's a kind of movie that gets under your skin, and if that sounds like a good time for you then its a movie that's worth your time. It is rumored to be gearing up for an American remake under the hand of Daniel Stamm (The Last Exorcism) and from the producers of Twilight. With those clues alone it feels like they might try to cram it into a PG-13 box (as it is, its pushing NC-17), and Stamm has stated that he will be changing the ending if the movie does indeed get made in order to make the movie more upbeat. I can absolutely assure you that doing that will ruin everything that makes this movie special, and so I highly recommend watching this before the American remake spoils it.",1350691200,4,4060,4.543091655266758

3695836,1,B001MEJYAK,"Spoilers, yadda yadda yadda....

Well, if ""Martyrs"" has achieved anything, it has finally ruined my interest in extreme forms of the horror genre.  In fact, I think we need a moratorium on labeling films like ""Martyrs"" as horror.  It's not a horror film.  I won't call it torture porn, because I doubt anyone is really getting off on it, but it's nothing more or less than torture cinema.  (Fine - call it ""torture art"" if you must.  I won't disagree.)  Excepting maybe a minute of the entire film, there's nothing scary about it.  Being scared - what I think of as a Lovecraftian ""atmosphere of dread"" - is necessary to a horror film, and is not the same thing as waiting for the next beating or scene of abuse.

But what's worse, this movie isn't even tense.  You know what's coming the moment the ""protagonist"" discovers the HIDDEN PASSAGE to the SECRET TORTURE DUNGEON - in a moment so absurd that I was even compelled to tell MY DOG that if he ever discovers a hidden passage to a secret torture dungeon to STAY OUT OF IT!  The last half of the film takes a ridiculously long time to get to the inevitable ""shocking"" reveal of not-particularly-gory gore.  (I don't understand people who say they fainted or got sick or even felt sick watching these movies.  What is supposed to be the goriest moment movie is almost laughably over-the-top - I would have laughed if I hadn't already had the realization that I just lost 85 precious minutes that could have been better spent on ""Anchorman"".)  Maybe it's just the fact that after ""Audition"" nothing on film is particularly shocking anymore, but there must be something more than ""ooh...our heroine is getting punched repeatedly!"" and ""a[...] getting her skin cut off!"" to make a film interesting.

The official reason for all the torture just doesn't work for me. It felt tacked on, like the last three seasons of ""Lost,"" as if the filmmakers realized that once they got the girl into the aforementioned secret (and stainless steel equipped!) torture dungeon, they actually needed to explain it in some way.  Who put it there?  Why?  And why do they have an elite force of armed French people all dressed in black to kind of keep it secure - but who are apparently on break for the day or so that the heroine and her girlfriend are busy shooting and burying everyone living in the house - innocent children included!  It seems to me that a lot of reviewers (not necessarily here; I don't feel up to browsing the reviews) are too quick to attribute ""depth"" and ""seriousness"" to any movie with a weird old woman talking nonsense about the meaning of life or death or whatever.  Many of these reviewers are likely the same people who announced that ""The Matrix"" ""really makes you think.""  (Wait a minute - wasn't there also a weird old woman in ""The Matrix"" who talked nonsense about the meaning of life and death???)  But I just don't buy it.  Thinking about THE BIG REASON for more than few minutes should make clear to almost anyone that it just doesn't add up.  By the admission of the leaders of the SECRET INTERNATIONAL CULT OF OLD PEOPLE (forgot to mention that too - another head-shakingly absurd moment), they have no good reason for doing any of this.  I'm not even talking about the moment that the weird old woman offs herself in a blatant last-ditch effort to give viewers something to talk about afterwards.  (Ooh!  What did she know?  It bottles the mind!  Yeah, you read that right - this film is NOT mind-boggling.  It is, in fact, mind-bottling.)  It comes a moment earlier when it is announced by cult leader #2 that no one before our heroine had even been able to talk about WHAT THEY SAW IN THE GREAT BEYOND.  So...cult leaders...then how exactly do you know that all of this torture can be justified by the effort to send people to the great beyond?  IF NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT?  The film would have made a lot more sense if the torture was being perpetrated by people who were simply insane.

Sigh....

3695857,3,B001MEJYAK,"""MARTYRS"" Unrated, The Weinstein Company #1000146

The Film:

""Martyrs"" is a fast-paced, well-crafted horror film, intense and harrowing. But it's nothing original. So I see no problem with offering up spoilers.

Nothing original, did I say? That's true, but it is many many other films. It starts with a pre-credit prologue from 15 years earlier (Hallowe'en, 1978; My Bloody Valentine, 1981; many many others). In the present day, Lucie, escapee/survivor of horrific child abuse, goes gunning for the ""parents"" who had chained her in a dark room and beat her daily, with the assistance of her friend Anna, who is unusually fond of Lucie (Heavenly Creatures, 1994; Havoc, 2005), despite not quite believing Lucie's tales of being tormented by an unseen stalker (Terrified, 1995). Lucie tracks down the erstwhile parents and, in the film's bloodiest scene, exacts revenge (The Virgin Spring, 1960; Death Wish, 1974; countless others) with a shotgun. Or was she mistaken (Death and the Maiden, 1994)? Either way, Anna and Lucie toss the corpses in a handy pit out in the yard (Kalifornia, 1993). But one of them, the purported mother, is not quite dead (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 1975; Single White Female, 1992). Anna tries to save her from Lucie's wrath but cannot. When Lucie realizes Anna's distrust, she cuts her own throat. The end.

Of the first half.

Now we reach the point where everyone seems to think there's some big surprise. There is, but it's still nothing new. The big surprise is, it becomes a different film. But still not an original one.

Anna pokes around the house and discovers a hidden door in a kitchen cabinet. It leads to an elaborate torture dungeon (Saw, 2004; Saw II, 2005; et cetera). Therein Anna rescues a current prisoner, horribly abused and tortured. Anna tries to help this pitiable creature, but then a SWAT team shows up and shoots the captive and seizes Anna. A middle-aged woman (who even looks somewhat like Ruth Gordon) confronts Anna and spouts some folderol about the eyes of those who are near death (The Asphyx, 1972), throwing in the observation that ""women can endure more"" (Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS, 1975). To prove it, she and her black-garbed cohorts toss Anna in the dungeon, chain her up, feed her gruel and have a thug beat her every day.

Time passes. Anna suffers. The dead Lucie's voice comes to her and tells her to just ""let go"" (Star Wars, 1977). Eventually, to provoke Anna's ultimate suffering, they skin her alive. This works, apparently, and Anna becomes (in their eyes) a ""martyr,"" one who sees beyond death (Flatliners, 1990). The whole coven is summoned for this momentous event. Coven? Yes, you should have known by the presence of Ruth Gordon, you're actually watching ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968). The whole thing has been a plot by some nefarious cult.

With the clock winding down, the film now cops out. What did Anna report from the realm beyond death? Only the Ruth Gordon lookalike (Catherine Begin) learned, and she sticks a gun in her own mouth rather than share. The end. Again.

The DVD:

Single disc packaged in a standard case with no inserts. Matted widescreen presentation, enhanced for widescreen TVs. Film and sound quality are both fine, as you'd expect from a modern film. Languages include the original French and dubbed English (which is well done). Subtitles available in French, English, and Spanish. Region 1 disc. Special features include teaser, theatrical trailer, and a quite lengthy (40+ minutes) ""Making Of"" featurette, in French with English subtitles. Most of this latter is on-set during the home-invasion scene (when Lucie shotguns those she thinks abused her, then is attacked by her phantom stalker), interspersed with an interview with director Pascal Laugier in what looks like a hotel room and some footage with the special-effects crew in their workshop. As ""Making Of"" featurettes go, this one is pretty good, very informative, and a bit more than the usual promotional fluff.",1336348800,10,3989,4.984962406015038

3695869,5,B001MEJYAK,"I rented this many years ago when Blockbuster was still around and I found it very disturbing for various reasons.

Young girls are kidnapped and tortured, specifically girls, towards the end the movie provides its own theoretical reason; remember, its fiction.
What appears to be truth on the surface, isn't necessarily the truth. And that groups of evil are integrated into normal society, where family members know what is happening, the evil that occurs in their residence - not to them, but to others, and it should provide insight as to how far people who really believe in something will go to accomplish a goal.
In my opinion, the french are notorious for delivering something cold and clinical, but that is deeply disturbing. This movie is about how a large organization kidnaps and tortures people in order to put them in some kind of waking state where they are in the afterlife, but are still alive (thats what i figured), and that the organization hopes to glean information or a knowing from their victims. Any organization that does this is evil.

The content of the film is deeply disturbing, but it opened my eyes to the possibility that such things might exist and in that way it increased the view.

I did not watch the un-rated version; based on previous comments, much of the torture was graphically shown, I watched the short version where whatever happened was after the fact...wouldnt have been able to stomach the graphic version.

Gave the film 5 stars becuase it was deeply disturbing, and it showed what evil people are willing to do to gain spiritual knowledge.",1334188800,,1590,4.834558823529412

Did I have a problem with the violence?  Not until the last third of the film.  Those parts were extraordinarily troubling to me.

Did I have a problem with the plot?  No, it made sense.  But I did have a problem with the ""premise"" - although the way things were told was great, the plausibility wasn't there.

I enjoyed the last five minutes very much because it tied everything together.

This movie is not bad.  This movie was not enjoyable.  This movie troubled me.  But this movie was well done.",1333843200,,792,4.214765100671141

3695872,5,B001MEJYAK,"This is a very well-made movie.  It has an excellent and thought-provoking story-line.  It is also extremely disturbing, and will take a while after seeing it to fully digest what you had seen.  I bought this on DvD at first.  I watched it (and I did need a few breaks) and let it sit for a few days.  Any movie that is original, provokes an emotional response and causes me to think about it for a long period of time goes to near the top of ""my list.""  I later bought it on blueray and gave my dvd copy to a friend.

I heard somewhere that Fox is remaking this and changing the ending.  Sometimes it seems like all we do is remake movies.  I am never going to see our remake of this.",1330992000,3,685,4.052238805970149
3695873,4,B001MEJYAK,"First off, if you are planning to watch this film, I recommend that you do not read any reviews as it might give away the story. Also, it might change your expectations of the film and you don't need to go into it thinking of it a certain way. And finally, this review does not contain any plot spoilers.

Yes, I would consider this a horror film, but not in the traditional sense. There is bloodshed, killing, and lots of brutality, but honestly, nothing that I would consider too difficult to watch if you are a seasoned horror movie fan. If you have maybe heard about ""the ending"" of this movie and you are worried you won't be able to watch it, let me just say that it isn't as bad or sick as you think.

I came across the title of this movie while looking up ""top horror movies"" lists and this one caught my eye. Based off the reviews I read (which I regret doing), I thought this film was going to be something completely different. ""Bloody, disgusting, hard to watch, heart breaking, sick, most disturbing movie ever"" as people like to describe it. At first, I thought this was going to be a torture porn film, but I did read that there were some philosophical and spiritual ideas in there, which intrigued me. I'll admit I am fascinated by torture in the philosophical sense, that some people are completely void of empathy and do some very depraved things to others. It excites me and terrifies me, knowing that people out there are suffering greatly everyday and the fate of humanity in this cruel world.

Moving on... admittedly, I did have very high expectations going into this film. After I was done watching it, I realized it wasn't at all what I expected and I actually felt a little disappointed. I decided I was going to be one of those people who thought the movie was overrated and over-hyped, etc. It had some scary scenes and there was a lot of hopelessness, but nothing that exceptionally moved me. But then for the rest of the day, I just couldn't stop thinking about the ending of the movie. I was annoyed with it. I wanted to make sense of the ending and I wanted to understand why some people thought it was so brilliant. I kept thinking about it and eventually decided to watch it again.

This time around, I didn't feel more or less scared but I felt something different from it. I'm not quite sure how to describe it. I feel like I 'get' the meaning this movie was trying to convey, despite the vague ending. And when you do, you will realize it too. You might feel horrified or you might just feel hopeless. Yet, is there a point to it all anyhow?

Horror fans who are expecting something like Saw or Hostel... it's NOTHING like it. Watch it anyways. It really is kind of poetic although it may not be apparent at first. As far as the violence level in it... if you can watch Saw/Hostel, you should have no problem seeing this. The people who think this is super disturbing and sick... I don't think of this movie that way at all. Yes, it is disturbing and sick but it is not the feeling I got in the end. I just feel sad. You might feel differently. I guess it depends on how you look at the ending. And for people who are not into horror... I think this might be too much for you. I wouldn't recommend this for 'fun Friday night horror with the family'.",1330819200,6,3286,4.353996737357259

Unrelenting torture of a female is not intertaining or interesting and this is certainly not a ""masterwork"" by any rational definition of the term. When the Director introduced the movie with an apology I thought he was doing it tongue and cheek, until I watched the film.  He should apologize and think about seeing a therapist along with the writer of this agonizing swill.  Why anyone would make a film like this is beyond me.  The positive reviews are almost as disturbing as the film.  I am no prude about violence in films, and am totally against censoring or banning of films, but fair warning is another thing. This movie is garbage of the lowest order. (It does not even deserve one star, but that is the lowest rating in this system.)",1328313600,13,864,4.590909090909091

By the time that I saw the credits roll, it felt like I had been hit with a brick.  I both love and loathe Martyrs.  I am never going to forget it, and I may never be able to watch it again, but it will always remain in my possession.  PoeBoy's review is better than anything that I can compose.

Wrong, wrong, wrong!  Watching this movie all the way through was akin to getting loaded and testing to see how many times I could punch myself in the face until I broke my nose. (Okay, so I tried it once already.  Cheap tequila; what's to do.) This flick would best serve as a conversation piece in showing the most obscenely tasteless and despicable film on hand.  SPOILER ALERT: take what used to be a beautiful, young, defenseless woman and she gets her face and body beaten up by a man twice her size. The plot thickens!  It happens over and over and over and over again.  To be fair, though, this movie's artistic merit and its meticuluosly crafted impact on its intended audience should not be underestimated.  If you happen to be one of those who ceremoniously take an inkling to ""self-gratification"" while watching flicks depicting real life footage of heinous acts in a concentration camp, then this movie should definitely hit the sweet spot.

Yes I have seen August Underground films, I have seen Men Behind the Sun, and I have seen a number of other just as graphic.  What sets Martyrs apart from the rest of these is the emotional connection to the main characters I felt, the sheer horror at what is happening to them.  I tend to be a clinical viewer of horror films....this film ripped straight through my normal detachment and truly FORCED me to feel the raw horror and anguish of the evil taking place.  I actually had tears in my eyes at the end, totally and with full empathy FEELING what she must have been feeling...not only the desolation, terror, and pain, but what I can only describe as acceptance and serenity with her situation.

There were moments when I could just stare at the screen, to afraid to actually try to understand the reasoning behind some of the scenes.  The story was sad, suspenseful, traumatizing and depraved.  Without saying too much and really spoiling the film for everyone, it left me in a dark place trying to figure out how I had gotten there.

She ends up going after the family/parents who tortured her. Also her friend ends up joining her there.

You really don't know whats going on in this movie for the first 40 minutes. Its hard to tell who's nuts, who's not, whats happening, etc- As the movie progresses you find out more information and it just gets stranger and stranger. Then we come to find out what Martyrs means...

I won't delve too much into the plot to give out anything but this was a sick piece of work. As in, the people who were the villains are one of the worst i've seen, but you find out they did it for a purpose. A purpose but still sick.

 I am greatly disappointed by the end of this film. At least let me know what the ""big secret"" is if you're going to subject me to a movie this disturbing.

The back of the dvd says "" it will make you question the world as you know it""- well, yea it did make me question it but i've already thought of things like this, what length some people will go to to gain something for their benefit.

4 stars for general all around goodness and concept. 3 because they didn't tell me anything at the end. As in they leave it a ""mystery"", which I don't like. If they were to reveal this secret I would have been impressed... but no, we get nothing but left without the big answer. Probably because the writer couldn't even think of what to say if the big secret was revealed, he couldn't even dream up something that good so he left it open ended... which disappointed me.

As far as purchasing this, It depends what you value in a horror film. If you love gore and a disturbing plot then you'll enjoy it. If you like some explanation to a huge ""secret"" then you won't care for that part. I think I am correct when I say they didn't reveal the secret, if not, then whatever but it left me disappointed. I really hated the villains in the movie towards the end, then I was confused, then questioning, then disappointed.

3695908,5,B001MEJYAK,"I watched this review from an interesting viewpoint. I'm an adult female, early 30s, who happened to be very alone in a dark house in the mountains when I saw it. I knew what was coming because I read the synopsis before viewing. It STILL changed the way I look at the genre.

**moderate spoilers**

""Torture Porn"" is a perjorative term.  I think there's no way you can separate having to see the torture. It's effective. We're not talking about a pack of savages or thugs a la I Spit On Your Grave - the protagonists in this movie were executing this nastiness from the same pedestal Eli Roth's hostel elite operate from. That's what makes it terrifying. Old, rich European people are supposed to be eating crumpets and passing their grandkids off to nannies. But I say that because I'm American. That angle actually makes this movie more terrifying for me.

**spoilers over**

This one will stick with you. If you have a problem with torture, gratuitous violence, force feeding - don't watch it. If you have a high moral compass to the point where you find watching something you don't agree with is going to make you have a Billy Graham hissy fit Amazon style, don't watch it. But if you decide to, know this movie is going to push your boundaries and - if your experience is anything like mine - it'll keep you looking over your shoulder when you walk through the yard at night by yourself. It's profoundly challenging, hard to watch, and extremely disturbing.

That being said, I made it through the whole thing while sitting by myself, alone in a house in the woods on a dark night. If I can do that without fast forwarding through the worst scenes, you know you're not really dealing with A Serbian Film or anything. But regardless of how you feel about Martyrs at the time, it will absolutely stick with you. It's haunting. Don't say I didn't warn you.",1310342400,4,1860,4.553892215568863
3695909,5,B001MEJYAK,"Wow. No, I mean WOW.

First things first: this is positively THE most graphic, disturbing movie I've ever seen in my life. The way I felt after seeing this film was the way you'd feel after waking up from a particularly vivid nightmare. It felt like, ""Whoa, did I just see that?"" The monster in this film is not some deformed creature in the basement, or a supernatural hellish thing coming out after dark, or even a prowling psychopath with a taste for human flesh. The monster is very human, and very normal, and it's in a place you're least likely to find, and its motives are nothing like what you thought.

Some people compare this to Hostel. Let me tell you... Hostel doesn't hold a candle to this. Hostel is boring, trashy torture porn. This is a masterpiece that looks deep into the human psyche, and reveals a picture that's both horrifying and intriguing. The first part is a bit predictable, but the second part... Boy oh boy. You think you know where it's going, and then it hits you over the head, makes you wish for a different turn of events, makes you want to look away over and over again, and yet you can't...

This is a masterpiece. A gruesome and mind-bending experience, to be sure, but an unforgettable one. Watch it. If you dare.",1310169600,174,1252,4.482456140350878

This brilliant film is going to haunt me for some time.  I had planned to watch a second film tonight but what can follow this magnificent masterpiece?

About the blu-ray...  I don't know if it's region locked but it plays on my region 1 player.  It's in French but English subtitles are available.  French is the only audio language and French and English are the only subtitles.  There is a spartan menu but the only other menu option is scene selections.  No other extras.  The sound is 5.1 DTS Master Audio. The aspect ratio is 16x9.  The video is 1080p.  Coded for 5.1 or not, it really sounded more like stereo... not a lot from the surrounds.

3695912,5,B001MEJYAK,"Prior to viewing Martyrs, I had come across many reviews which obviously I would ignore. After all, I love the Horror genre as lately French Horror films have really stepped up to the plate & delivered the goods. Martyrs isn't an exception to that rule although I believe this one may have surpassed even my expectations.

Forget the slasher genre before watching Martyrs. I can go ahead & tell you this in advance. Irregardless of what glimmer of hope you may detect in the initial chapters, Martyrs will crush your very soul after it settles inside your skin. Don't expect any heroes/heroines but brace yourself instead for a very extreme & morbid film which may be anything but predictable as far as Horror films usually go.  A happy ending to satisfy consumers who only watch Horror films as a means of escape may find themselves way out of their comfort zone and I strongly urge them to steer away from Martyrs.

On second thought, try to avoid reading online reviews as many opinions may contain spoilers. Martyrs is perhaps most effective if experienced without an prior introduction. Even so, only the most hardcore fans should even attempt viewing this psychological masterpiece. If you somehow feel you've lost your edge after watching Saw or Hostel, I would highly suggest you pick up something else instead.

Martyrs is the unforgettable story of a young child who manages to escape from a house of enslavement & torture only to find she can never truly escape her past. The film skips ahead 15 years & we find the child now grown & hell-bent on a violent rampage in hopes of killing her captors. Her lifelong friend arrives at the scene of the bloodbath only a bit too late & then the real horrors begin.

Throughout the next 45 minutes, we are then subjected to a series of terrifying images which are even more devastating & unpleasant than anything witnessed in the initial opening. Laugier doesn't cater to the faint of heart nor does he wish to join the ranks of other film-makers who specialize in the so-called torture porn films. (As one reviewer has already stated,I think we need a new name for films which normally would fall into that category.) Instead, we are presented a deeply moving study of trauma & it's emotional effects on the human heart. Martyrs easily gets my vote for the most macabre work of art bequeathed in many years.

Actually, I've not seen anything like it before or after watching this French film. Now, the actors speak French  with English subtitles, but it doesn't take away anythig, as there is not much talking during most of the bloody carnage. The first half of the movie moves along at a fair pace with some pretty good violence, the when you think the movie is just about over, watch out, things kick into high gear and don't stop. This movie is a wild ride, the likes you may never see again in a movie. So, treat yourself while you still can.

That said, this is an extremely harsh and graphic film, with a lot of unsettling subject matter and visuals.  Not recommended for the faint of heart.

One could argue that this is just an artsy exploitation flick.  To that, I counter with the simplest of arguments: exploitation films exist for the visceral thrill, whereas art continues to live with you after the experience on emotional and intelligent levels.  Martyrs will stay with you for a while, will make you think and remember the characters, and for that alone, this film rises above pure exploitation.",1302048000,,832,4.823943661971831

I went in expecting psychological tension, nothing supernatural, and extreme graphic violence. Well, I got all that, and I got something else: a movie with a lot on its mind. There are spiritual questions raised here about the meaning and value of suffering. There are class issues flayed open in ways I didn't expect. And above it all, there is a running critique of American foreign policy, particularly as it relates to our ""detainees."" What would it be like to be stripped of every right, for all time, and handed to people whose only job was to torment you? Martyrs gets into that space.

This is one of the most uncompromising movies I've ever seen. Every frame dares you to watch it, and the only hint of catharsis is contained in a whisper you don't hear. If you are faint of heart, weak of stomach, or looking for an easily enjoyed piece of entertainment, stay far away from this film. But if you seek out art that moves you to think, art that moves you to rage, film that challenges you to think about what the limits of film really are, Martyrs does all that.",1300406400,3,1221,4.426666666666667

Coincidently i had been reading a book about how thousands of modern day near death experiences, NDE's have masses in common with eachother and with accounts written in the 2'500 year old tibetan book of the dead and the 4,440 year old egyptian book of the dead. Also the reason women are more responsive to this is because they are close to the source of life since they bring it into this world and are therefore closer to next world when you leave this one, just so you understand why i found this film so realistic and effective. its details like this that made this such a memorable film for me.",1300060800,,1528,4.28719723183391

3695931,4,B001MEJYAK,"Martyrs (Pascal Laugier, 2008)

Pascal Laugier's first feature film, Saint Ange, is one of those movies that you watch and simply can't believe it's a first feature film. It's absolutely stunning, a fantastic piece of atmospheric supernatural horror easily on a par with Amenabar's The Others or del Toro's The Devil's Backbone, and it made my list of the hundred best movies of the past decade. I had no idea what Laugier's second feature was going to bring to the table, but if you'd asked me in 2008, when torture porn was already dying on the vine, what directors would be able to bring something fresh to the table, Laugier would have been on my short list.

Enter Martyrs, Laugier's second feature, and quite possibly the best torture porn film ever made. I gave Hostel and Saw high ratings, but as I explained during a debate on the subject back in 2006, it's more because those are important to American cinema (vis-a-vis us finally getting to where the Asian film market was twenty years previous) and them being enjoyable than any sort of filmmaking brilliance. This, on the other hand, is flat-out brilliant, and it would have gotten an even higher rating had I been able to figure out what the hell was going on in the first half-hour of it.

Plot: We begin with a look back at two girls, Anna and Lucie, in a facility of some sort (orphanage? group home?), then fast-forward to the present day, where the bulk of the film takes place. We begin with Lucie (Hereafter's Mylene Jampanoi) breaking into what seems to be a typical suburban family's house and killing them. She then calls Anna (The Three Loves of Daniel Shore's Morjana Alaoui), and we begin to get the backstory: Lucie is convinced these people held her captive, torturing her, for years. Anna is not entirely sure, but is willing to help Lucie get rid of the bodies, at least. Until they discover they're not alone in the house...

If the movie were just this, given Laugier's ability to make the air in his films practically shimmer with suspense, he would have come up with a solid, if relatively unremarkable, suspense/slasher/monster/what-have-you flick. (While I don't want to give it away, I will say that the ""not alone"" that they're in the house with is played by a Cirque du Soleil contortionist, Isabelle Chasse, and she is terrifying.) But that's only the first bit. It takes up about two-thirds of the movie, and that is, indeed, a solid-f-relatively-unremarkable suspense/slasher/monster/what-have-you flick. But then Laugier throws us the ultimate curve ball: one should assume Laugier wouldn't take on a straight torture porn flick and that he was playing the genre's conventions and our expectations of them, but one didn't, and one felt entirely stupid. But just because Laugier is playing the genre, and playing you, and looking at the situation he's created (he also wrote the script) with profound sympathy and even a hint of sweetness, that doesn't mean he doesn't realize he's still making a torture porn film. The last half-hour or so is empirically less ugly than the first bit, but because of the way he's set everything up, he's created atmospheric horror at its best; your mind should be able to fill in all the blanks, save the one blank he wants you to not fill in until the Big Reveal. (There's a great deal I want to say about the Big Reveal to folks debating it on various movie sites, but it would all be major spoilers. I'll just say this: it's quite obvious Pascal Laugier is familiar with the work of Georges Bataille, especially The Tears of Eros.)

Also worth noting, because he's suddenly exploded: the film contains Xavier Dolan, albeit in a rather small role. (Dolan is getting major press as the director and star of Heartbeats as I write this. I've heard the word ""prodigy"" attached to his name three times this week alone.)

One of the things that separates movies like Martyrs and Hostel from the run-of-the-mill torture porn flick is character development. You can identify more with a three-dimensional character than you can with the cardboard dummies who populate films like Train, released the same year as Martyrs, or The Collector (the 2009 film from the Saw-franchise guys). This is what makes Martyrs truly effective, and it's also what makes it art, as opposed to cheap exploitation. Something like The Collector is obviously there for the sole purpose of making money. Martyrs exists to explore something deeper. This has, inevitably, made it a disappointment to the audience who most expected to like it (and the ambiguous ending has the typical torture porn viewer in fits, as I noted a couple of paragraphs ago), and the torture porn label has probably kept away the people who would most appreciate it. I'm telling you not to make that mistake--this is a serious piece of filmmaking, not a quick-buck-out-the-door fly-by-night production. If you're squeamish, you may not enjoy the experience, but Martyrs is a movie you should definitely see. ****",1299542400,4,4984,4.857647058823529

The premise is utterly stupid - this is torture porn of the worst kind, because it attempts to have a point.  There is no sympathetic character here, there is no fight... the main character simply gives in to whatever is happening.  This movie attempts to glorify submission in the face of abuse, like saying oh no ladies you just have to learn how to transcend it when your husband is beating you each day don't bother fighting, and degrade humanity in any form (such as being traumatized or reacting like a caged animal when finally freed from years of torture instead of attempting to stay alive... I mean honestly, if you've seen this piece of trash, who the hell would want to?).  The only saving grace is that nobody is raped.

The whole martyr twist was obviously an excuse, and does not feel like it had anything to really do with what happens.  This is just BS that is dangerous because it is riding in the disguise of being ""philosophical"".  After watching I had to really work on not letting this movie get stuck in my head, I felt like I had to wash my brain, and it made me sick that anyone would make this let alone watch it and think it was ""thought provoking"".

Lots has been said about the plot or lack there of so I won't go into it. Lets go straight to the point. If you want a movie with extreme torture scene after torture scene then this is the movie for you. This being an horror movie there's nothing wrong with that.

3695960,5,B001MEJYAK,"Wow. Where to begin with this one. This is what American horror movies should strive for! The story, the acting, the cinematography... everything adds up here to nothing short of a horror masterpiece in my opinion. Let me start off by saying that this film is dark to the core and not for the casual movie fan... so if you're not on the adventurous side, don't even think about this one!

Its so shocking and real because as you're watching you realize this could really happen... and probably has happened in some way in real life, which makes it all the more scary and shocking. The actual meaning of the events you see on screen aren't revealed until much later in the movie, but once they are the whole sick affair reveals a concept that should inspire endless discussion and pondering after the film is over. I really can't recommend this enough if you can take the extreme subject matter of the film. It's been a couple days after I've watched it and I still can't get it out of my head... shocking to the core; honestly one of the most hard hitting and conceptually brutal movies I've ever seen.

It's one of the few films whose message and underlying plot are actually darker than the actual violence on screen (not that it's not violent, trust me there is plenty of brutal violence here). If you've forgotten what it feels like to be moved and emotionally jarred by a movie, here is the answer. Must see. 5/5 stars.",1294358400,4,1424,4.515503875968992

For most of the movie you were watching a very large man violently pummel a small, chained woman. It felt like I was watching a snuff film. The beatings went on and on and on until they had almost killed her and then they skinned her alive. I will not even go into why they said that they were doing this because the reason is so absurd.

Though there is definitely violence and gore, it is not gratuitous, and actually needs to be included (Although, the graphic nature of KNIFE is also necessary).

3695979,5,B001MEJYAK,"martyrs is your typical horror movie: people get tortured, people die, people seek revenge, there's blood everywhere, blah blah blah. but what set this movie apart was the stellar performances by the actors and actresses, and the graphics of the movie.

the movie moves fast, which i loved since my attention span is worse than a goldfish's. a tween-age girl, lucie, escapes a basement after being tortured for years by her adoptive parents, and falls into the arms of an orphanage who nurse her back to health and send her on her way once she turns of age. at the orphanage, she makes a friend, anna, and tells her everything that happened in that horrifying basement (which the viewer is not told). lucie convinces anna to aide her in seeking revenge on the family that abused her, so they both go back to the house to do the devil's work. lucie lays out the family with an elephant rifle in their own home, which anna tries to bury the evidence in the back yard. meanwhile in the home, lucie is haunted by her past of abuse, and begins to go insane. not long after lucie turns the tables on herself, anna is captured, and this is where the REAL story behind the movie begins...

now don't think i spoiled anything about the movie, because all of this happens in about the first 30 mins. i will spoil the plot a little bit, and say that the movie doesn't really revolve around lucie, whom you are introduced to in the beginning and is thought to be the main character. the movie is actually about her friend anna...why, you will have to watch to find out. but the relationship between these two girls is so loving, caring, and sincere. you see these characters as people, with emotions and thoughts just like you and i. martyrs is extremely graphic and realistic, none of this asian horror crap where someone gets a tiny cut on their finger and magically there's a blood geyser spewing out of them 10 ft tall. there are many graphic scenes of abuse, with eyes swollen shut, balding/hair loss, and just all around frail victims. but what really put me under was one of the very last scenes in the movie of anna. i never saw it coming, and when i did i almost threw up all over myself. i love horror and i love gore, but you saw anna as a character, evolve as a person, a friend, a lover, a fighter...and to have this happen to her...i had to put on cartoons before i went to bed because that image was burned into my retinas!

Second of all, I've read some reviewers claim there was no suspense in this film, which really could not be farther from the truth.

If you claim you did, I can't be 100% sure, but you're probably a liar.

Third, this was not gratutious torture like some would claim it to be.  You want to watch gratutious torture, go see rest stop, or Turistas or other assorted films.  This was an intelligent film.  I can't really explain more without ruining the ending for you who haven't seen it.  If you're looking for a torture porn flick to satiisfy yourself with, move on.  Don't watch this.  If you're looking for a movie that has a meaning, that requires you to think, that will horrify you, and that WILL make you open your eyes to the true criminals of this world.

Placed in a specialized institution later on, she grows up troubled but relates to another girl, the two of them forming a solid, mutually supportive tandem which quickly focuses on retrieving the family of kidnappers and taking matters in their own hands. What none of them could imagine, though, is that by getting too close to fire, they could get burnt...

In Martyrs, horror and shock don't come primarily from blood, although there is some, or first-degree violence but from the fact that, like Inside, the movie dares attacking what's normally off limits, in this case innocence, the thirst for revenge, love, womanhood, religion and more.

Also, the theme's simplicity enables the film-makers to focus and avoid the dispersion of the narrative: it's about torture as a way to reach a ""higher plane"" of human consciousness, the rationalizing of torture (by some) as a justifiable means to a (superior, mystic) end with complete disregard for human free will.

On top of it, the theme benefits from a flabbergasting final twist. For most of its duration, the movie looks very much like a colder, less gory, more intimate version of Hostel... until something turns it upside down, revealing the disturbing aim of the whole horror and giving it a totally unexpected, mad-like-hell, that-can't-be-true, ""higher plane"" conclusion.

Finally, the theme is supported by impeccable acting and filming that together shade a powerful and clinical light onto the movie, conveying a desperate sense of isolation: cold colours, cold characters dressed in dark clothes, cold materials such as shiny (marble?) floors, concrete walls, steel, glass... there's no warmth and no hope here except when the camera occasionally depicts naked human bodies.

In short, a very powerful, jaw-dropping, eye-opening horror movie and another top-notch proof that good ideas, creativity and risk-taking, which are -and have ALWAYS been- at the core of all forms of arts will always get the upper hand on big bucks, brainless, risk-adverse creation.",1282003200,3,2128,5.321428571428571

  What makes this movie so fantastic is not only the visual gore (which is pretty wild), but it's perfect blend of psychological terror - both within oneself and of others - amazing cinematography, a pretty excellent soundtrack, and of course, the acting (primarily the two main characters - both of whom are pretty smokin', in my opinion).

This is not to say that it's a bad film, because technically speaking it's superior from just about every angle. And while it is sometimes is the violence that startled me, it was more about the relentless tension and fear the film builds so well. It simply never lets up. The first half of the film sets the stage for a completely surprising plot twist that gudes the story to film's ultra-disturbing second half and ultimate conclusion.

I have no plans of getting into the plot too deeply, because ruining this movie's surprises would be tantamount to a cinema crime.  Would I would like to focus on are some exceptional elements.  This movie delves into realms not normally touched by the horror genre.  The violence is extreme and over the top, but it has a reason behind it: Albeit, a twisted and sick reason.  However, it is not mindless violence without cause just for the sake of ""goring"" someone to death.  I am not a huge fan of gore.  However, this film uses it properly to convey its intended message.  MARTYRS is very successful in making the audience think hard about the questions it puts forth.  I find it terribly interesting that the ""bad guys"" seem to all come from the upper class of society and for some reason they felt distinctly Nazi-like.  The film is still tumbling around in my head as I try to come to grips with its intended message.  I find much ambiguity, but I also find pointed questions and fearful revelations.  Another issue of note is the near absence of curse words.  American horror is filled to the brim with ""F-Bombs"" and all other variety of offensive language.  MARTYRS seems to have no use for such language.  It does not need it.  It is also proof that superior suspense and horror films can be made without the need for constant cursing.  I found it very refreshing.  There is some mild nudity, but it is not sexual in any way.  The focus of the film is its stunning and shocking visuals and the message it is trying to convey.  The truth is:  This is not a ""happy time"" film experience.  If you want to feel good, do not watch this film.  (Watch THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE instead)  If you want to be spoon fed, do not watch this film.  If you want to think and test your analytical powers and your ability to pay attention to nuances, this is the film for you.  NO WAY SHOULD ANY CHILD SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

I live in australia, and i went out of my way to order the unrated region 1 version, because it was 1 minute OVER the running time, and the region 4 (australian) copy says 97min, which is 2 minutes UNDER the running time.
And as a result i end up with a version thats could very well be cut by either 3 or 4 minutes? Not cool amazon..

I'm one of those horror/slasher/sci-fi movie addicts who you hear screaming the loudest for something fresh and original.  Well, the French-Canadinmade Martys, hit me square in the face and all I can say is that I will never ever watch this exercise in sadism/horror again.

Yet,I'm not urging others not to see it since they may be able to figure out the logic behind this gorge-inducing orgy of sadistic torture at its most extreme.  It makes the Hostel movie look like The Blind Side.

Pascal Laugier is the writer/director behind this grim creatio. The story follows a badly beaten young girl who has escaped a home prison where she has been beaten, sliced and tortured for months. Fifteen years later, she returns to murder the family that enslaved her.  The girl dies, though, and her girl friend then becomes a prisoner of a cult of your everyday German torturers.  Their reason for trying to torture her to death is  see if she can see what lies ahead in death>

The beatings and torture of the frail girl are nonstop. A man keeps visiting her to beat him violently and kicked her as hard as he can. She's demoralized in everyway.

At the end, there's no justice or relief. The sadists and killers all go their merry way after the girl--who has been skinned alive by the male sadist--finllly dies.

To me, Pascal Laughier wanted to make a violent, sadistic movie that would push it over the edge.

There are no heroes. There are only human monsters.

I had not read any reviews or anything beforehand either, I do this because I've been burned by going into movies like this before with high expectations and just being utterly dissapointed, so nowadays I try not to form too much of an opinion before seeing something.

So all that said, when I did finally get around to watching this I was quite pleasantly surprised to find a movie which I really enjoyed. There is of course some violence and gore but I didn't feel that was really the focus of the movie, and I thought the story and reason behind the situation these girls found themselves in was the interesting part. This is of course not revealed fully until late in the movie.

And I also found that since watching this I've spent a fair amount of time thinking both about 'filling in the blanks' in my interpretation of the ending, and about the lengths some people will go to for the sake of knowledge.

However, don't expect to be entertained, nor have your intellect challenged. I wouldn't go so far as so say that this movie glorifies violence, even though the violence is brutally realistic (i.e. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, where the drug use that is depicted should make anyone think twice before sticking a needle in their arm).

3696004,1,B001MEJYAK,"""Martyrs"", is a movie that is designed to offend you to the max.

What is it about?...
Its about glorifying >torture<,  in High Def.
Its about some whacked out scientists who want to fulfill their ambition, which is to  create an actual ""Martyr"" by torturing young teenage girls till they  turn into a Martyr via this ""scientific"" process...
In the beginning of the movie one victim escapes, meets a friend, and 15 years later (flash foward) the victim finds the  ""Martyr"" house where she was tortured and returns with the friend and kills a couple of the scientists with shotguns who are there.....
To make this more interesting for engrossed lovers of spurting shotgun wounds, she dramatically shotgun blasts the 2 young teens who belong to the scientists as well.
She lingers a while in doing this so as to make the gorefest as brutal as possible.
In an odd side note, it is a flaw in the script that the young teen girl (daughter) who is sitting at the table with the Scientists, is not already being used in the experiment, but, no matter, coz that would not make this gory mess of a film any better..
So after the revenge scene, our 1st Martyr victim eventually  ends up killing herself when the friend (suddenly) does not believe that she was ever tortured and thinks this ""family"" was killed needlessly...
So, she slits her own throat...she >Martyr's herself< (clever screenplay;-) for the cause, to prove she is telling the truth..
Then of course, the confused friend is trapped in the house by other scientists who swarm in right on cue, who then chain her and  torture her more and more as the film winds down,... and eventually they skin her alive while she's awake in hopes they have FINALLY created their Martyr masterpiece so that they can experience her ""Transcendent Transfiguration into Martyrdom"" vicariously....and they do, sorta, as the ""2001 A Space Oddessy"" Lightshow suddenly takes over the movie.. but you wont...you will just be disgusted that you sat there nearly 2 hours  and watched mindless, soul numbing, conscience searing, bloody torture porn, marketed as ""philosophical gore-art""....",1266710400,13,2117,4.893854748603352
3696005,5,B001MEJYAK,"I just watched the movie today.
It's horrifying what they went through and you sympathize with the girls.
Theres many reviews giving you the basics and they are spot on.
Watch and read the whole thing. Don't just expect for all those horrible things to happen just for the sake of being shocked. Which you will be anyways, but it's relevant and you will understand why towards the end.

While the movie played i didn't know what to expect next. It did make me sick, scared and it even made me cry a bit seeing what those horrible people did. They had no sympathy, they were souless, they wanted truth and would torture people just for it. At the end i got it all now. It hit me at the end, i felt great impact with all sorts of emotions and for some strange reason it made me feel good after taking it all in.

I'm still amazed from it, even after hours of watching it and if a movie makes you feel like that then it cannot be dismissed as anything less. A brilliant film that i am now proud to say it's my favorite of the horror genre!! Many people will never understand why, but those of you out there who do, you know the power of films.

I recommend Martyrs for people that are looking for a meaning, a story, instead of just plain entertainment out of girls being tortured, but if thats your thing then hey who am i to stop you? Also for people that have strong stomachs, and are horrorfanatics such as myself.

3696006,5,B001MEJYAK,"A quest for retribution spins horribly out of control in this unrelentingly brutal, gut-wrenching and emotionally devastating French stunner. A modern masterpiece, not for the easily disturbed.",1263859200,2,193,6.185185185185185
3696017,3,B001MEJYAK,"""It will polarize audiences!"" scream the reviews.  ""Brilliant!"" say some.  ""Grotesquely bad!"" moan others.  It's been called shocking, relevatory, revolutionary, unsettling, profound, and even genius.

Let's not get carried away.

First of all, unless you yourself are a mass murderer or life-hardened torturer, this movie WILL probably bother you.  That is, without question, one of its goals.  The film excutes a little soft-shoe at the end to make you believe that goal is secondary -- to convince you that the movie (and its heroes and villains) had a higher purpose -- but I'm not sold.  Not at all.  I'll get to that.  In the meantime: be prepared for some gut-churning violence.  Lots and lots of it.  So much so that, yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is gratuitous.

I'm going to harp on this for a bit.  I've read many, many reviews that argue that the film is in no way gratuitous, that the overwhelming amount and quality of the violence is in service of a greater point.  These people are, at best, unaware of what the word ""gratuitous"" means.  At worst, they are willfully and gleefully unaware of the film's point.

IF the film's goal were simply to horrify and unsettle, then the violence is by no means gratuitous.  ""Let's make people puke!"" the director could've announced.  ""Let's cause them to choke up bile into their sinuses!""  IF he'd said this, then the violence would've fit the film to a T.  Children being beaten and flayed.  Various implements hard bolted into bones.  Knives, shotguns and hammers.

This is not the film's goal, however.  The first half of the film shows us a young child escaping from some kind of torture chamber and undergoing extensive recuperation, during which she befriends another girl.  Fifteen years later, the two girls set off on a quest of vengeance, which doesn't take that long, really.  Up to this point, most viewers will be excited to know what happens next, will be intrigued and (if not slightly sickened) happily disgusted.

Then the film spirals into a philosophical black hole.  The story suddenly veers away from the (so far) compelling revenge plot and enters a world of weird and wealthy people who have sinister and stupid goals.  I wish I could go into it, but I don't want to give anything away.  I'll just say this:

Most people struggle, at their most basic, with one question: what's the point?  People find the ""point"" in lots of ways, but throughout human history, the most popular explanations have had to do with the world outside of the human realm.  With that ""sleep"" that Hamlet was so uncertain about (""perchance to dream?"").  People have used lots of things to legitimize or discredit or dis/prove the purposefulness of the human experience: drugs, war, religion, meditation, and logic.  This film is, basically, about a, shall we say, unique way of discerning the validity of the human experience.

Does that sound pompous or self-indulgent?  That's because it is.  Especially the way this film goes about it.  Hence the gratuity.  Needless to say, this film demonstrates a rather macabre way of sussing out the existence of a Higher Purpose.  As soon as it becomes clear where the film is headed, as soon as the film reveals the bunny in its hat, the magic trick is over.  And yet this movie goes on for about fifteen more minutes, showing the same violence, the same torture, the same ridiculous excess.  It is, in effect, trying to make martyrs out of the audience's sensibilities.  Understandable, but not clever.  It's like the child who does the old ""knock knock"" joke that involves the following exchange dozens of times:

Child: Knock, knock.
You: Who's there?
Child: Banana.
You: Banana who?
Child: Knock, knock.

This goes on and on, with you checking your watch and indulging the child.  Finally, the kid says, ""Orange.""  ""Orange who?"" you respond.  The punchline?  ""Orange you glad I didn't say banana?""

Ah, it's punny.  There's an element of wit to it.  But it's freaking annoying.  Gratuitous.  This film is that joke, but it's not funny, and although its final line has the same spirit of word play and snarkiness to it as ""Orange you glad I didn't say banana?"" it is nowhere near as decisive or illuminating.  Instead, this film plays off obfuscation as if it were the same thing as brilliance.  That's not bad all by its lonesome -- other films have done the same thing with far greater pinache and beauty -- but coming at the tail end of so much nauseating wickedness and hell, it's very much a cop-out.  It's as if the filmmaker couldn't conceive of any straight-forward way to justify the movie he just made, and so he aborts the whole thing with an incoherent mumble.

Five stars for the first half.  Zero stars for the last half.  I recommend you stop the movie at about the forty minute mark.  (After the ""monster"" is dealt with once and for all.)  You'll have watched an artfully filmed and coherent vignette of a film.  Everything past that is worthless.",1262476800,10,4963,4.782762691853601
3696018,5,B001MEJYAK,"Martyrs was one of my first delves into French horror and it seems to have set the bar remarkably high.  What appealed to me most about Martyrs was the cinematography and the overall appearance of the film.  While the immediate appearance is clear and clean the atmosphere which is presented is very dark, disturbing and hopeless.

The movie can really be split into two halves with each containing their own great moments.  The beginning of the movie will draw attention quickly as it transitions into the core of the storyline.  The blunt, brutal and fitting violence is mildly underplayed by a creepy and frightening ghost/demon that accentuates the despair and hopelessness captured by this film.

The second half emphasizes the repetition of the abuse inflicted upon the girls.  A day-in-day-out approach begins to wear on you, as the viewer, and I personally began to feel helpless and taken back by the pain and abuse that I had witnessed.  And while the ultimate reasoning to the punishment inspires some thought, it leads to an ending that is as dark as the rest of the film as it exemplifies the entire movie in just a few moments.

The violence and gore contained within the movie are not what a modern 'horror' fan may expect.  The scenes in Martyrs are not over the top with gore and blood.  The movie is well done and the gore is done tastefully and the amount is deserved and fitting to the overall film.  This is not a movie that is bloody or gory simply to be so, the violence contained fits what the movie needs which adds much more to the movie than what excessive violence takes away.

Martyrs is an amazing movie that I have undoubtedly given five stars.  The acting, atmosphere, cinematography, concept and score are all notable by way of invoking several emotions from the viewer throughout the movie from the hopeless and painful abuse to the unsettling and frightening demon to the dismal, Pyrrhic ending.",1259625600,3,1930,4.756756756756757
3696019,4,B001MEJYAK,"Let me start off by telling you my own view on some feelings/comments this film has drawn from other viewers: I don't think Laugier's Martyrs is anywhere near as pholosophical and thought provoking as Irreversible (to give an example). It's beautifully shot and intense, but there's nothing to really think about here. The thing many viewer's note about the plot is that it deals with existence itself -or the moment where it runs away from you. But it never really goes deeper into the subject, which is fascinating by itself. We get a lot of nightmare-inducing beautifully shot sequences which make up for a brilliant experience. This is not a movie, it's a thrill-ride into some places not everybody is ready to dwell into.
Now, onto the film itself. Here you have one of the most intense and explosive experiences in terror. It is not Eli Roth's crap or Saw or Haute Tension. This is something else. This is a road where everything is thorn-covered and those thorns turn thicker with each extra minute. You will not get any pleasure from it as you do with regular slasher fare. This is the equivalent of a cinematic nightmare and it delivers some impressive images. Yeah, I've seen gorier and more bizarre stuff, but the way Martyrs is presented grabs you immediately by the throat and never lets go. There's no resting points in this picture. Once you go down the stairs you'll have to take the 1,000 steps without any time to breath. And that's one of the things that makes it so fantastic.
If you like your films to take your brain into the darkest of forests, then you're in for quite a rush. It's horror the way it's intended to crawl beneath your skin.",1258934400,,1662,4.63728813559322
3696020,5,B001MEJYAK,"So I just got watching Martyrs and I came to Amazon to give my seller negative feedback.  When I ordered this movie I was under the impression that I was getting an American film with a foreign cover.  Well I got the foreign film that it is.  Obviously I did not pay attention to the site when it told me it was in French.  Now that I got my stupidity out there, you might not want to read any more of this review, as I am apparently not all that bright.

I won't relive the story as many other reviewers like to do.  I read the product description (minus Language: French).  I am sure you have done the same and don't need me to repeat it here...like so many other people like to do.

And now we are to the whole review part.  Umm, yeah, different.  Wasn't expecting that.  Waste of my time?  No way.  Good flick.  Well printed. Well acted.  Not a slasher movie by any means.  Yes there was some killing, but not the typical, ""I'll be right back..."" kind of stuff.  Blood was abundant, but appropriate when used.  I found myself getting caught up in the images so much that I would have to rewind the movie just so I could read the dialog.  I saw someone write that the ending was less than acceptable, and I would have to agree.  It was almost a comical ending.  I think the writers got tired and were probably pressured by a deadline for them to cut it short the way they did.  The movie did drag on at times.  I had to check the timer to see how much movie was left...""What?  It is only at 45 minutes?  Seems like it has been at least an hour!""...Not saying it was boring.  It kept my attention.  I was just so wrapped up in it that I lost track of time.  Kinda saw one part of it coming near the middle, but, for the most part, I just let the movie take me where it wanted to and sat back to enjoy the movie(as much as a normal person can ""enjoy"" a torture film).  No it wasn't easy to watch but that is what makes this movie such a good buy.  People don't buy torture movies because they want to laugh or cry or even be scared.  They want to be disturbed.  They want their bubble to be popped.  They don't want to be comfortable.  They want their views of the world (as well as life in general) to be challenged.  Or they make a mistake and buy the wrong movie.  After a few minutes the mistakers (I just made that up...you like it?) should turn off the movie as quickly as possible and press on with their lives as if nothing ever happened.  There is no need to review a well made movie simply because you are not comfortable with the subject.  Wait that sounds like I am into torture.  I am not.  Hmm...where was I going with that?  So anyway, I am now bashing people that bashed this movie so this review has taken a turn for the worse.

My movie is over and I am left with the feeling of what now.  What am I supposed to feel based on what I have seen over the last 90 minutes?  Am I outraged?  Am I saddened?  Am I supposed to feel intensly sorry for the women tortured?  Am I supposed to want to save the world or am I just supposed to know that this kind of weirdness is present in the world?  I am left with this cloud in my head...not sure what is in there.  I will just have to feel around for a while to get my bearings.

BTW, I saw on this page Amazon says there is an intro.  I didn't get that on my version of the DVD.  Hope you enjoy it.

Bottom line: Would I buy the movie again?  I have bought duplicate movies (let me refer you to paragraph 1), but if I had lost my copy of this movie or had rented it, the answer is yes I would buy this movie.",1258502400,24,3568,4.014265335235378

It is brutal, cruel, sadistic, and yet very real.  We hear about these kinds of things happening, yet rarely have 1st-hand experience (thank goodness for that).  I guess it goes to show that, in the lack of a soundly edified social structure keeping a close eye on one's actions (or better yet, when micro-societies possess the power to recreate their own set of rules), the ideal excuse for releasing the primitive beast inside is rendered.  Could we all be seeking silently for that one instance in which all repercussions are lost, and sadistic impulses redefine our very course of action?  Within the context of a very well encapsulated delusion envisioned by an obviously deranged person, the breath of existence is reduced to satisfying the whims of ignorance.  Now, the most important thing to resonate, no matter how utterly humiliated and physically/psychologically fragmented one becomes, the absurdity of reality will obviously take care of everyone, but one can still muster up the power to have the last laugh, as is evident in this film (without giving anything away, especially since this conclusion is highly subjective).

3696025,4,B001MEJYAK,"...not the faint of heart or mind.

Not to give any plot points away, ""Martyrs"" is--succinctly--good.  It's one of those films that you watch with your hands cupped over your mouth, tears pouring down your face... At no time did I ever lean back in my seat with relief.  Not even at the end.  In fact, I started at the credits dumbly until they finished.

It is a powerful film.  The narrative unfolds slowly and halfway through it one is left wondering where this could possibly be going and how on earth can it get any worse than it already has?  Then it does.  The main character is plunged into a situation that I will not delve deeper into to save those who may watch.  As a warning, you may only want to watch it once (as I did).  While the characters resonate deeply with me and I am invested in both of their stories, I don't think I can watch this happen again.  But I do recommend it for it's dramatic narrative.  As far as story-telling goes, ""Martyrs"" weaves one hell of a tale that leaves the viewer thinking about the outcome for hours after you have turned the DVD player off.

As an avid horror film watcher, I am a poor gauge to measure how ""gory"" something is (after seeing so many I've gotten rather desensitized to the imagery and this, frankly, worries me).  I'll put it this way: emotionally, by the end of it all, I felt like curling into a dark corner and crying for a while (and I did end up bawling for a some time).  And yes, it is violent.  The images in the last twenty to fifteen minutes were hard for me to watch, but I was just too transfixed (in the ""Oh God, Oh God, Oh God"" sense of the word) to turn away.",1257552000,4,1640,4.208333333333333

I thought ""what is it with the French films lately?"" After 'Frontiers', 'Them' and 'Irreversible' I thought they'd gone as far as possible in assaulting the audience with truly unsettling stories and imagery, but this took the cake. This is not to say this is some mindless Hollywood gore-fest. This film is as deep as it is gut-wrenching. But as good as it is, I'm not certain I could handle another viewing.

The film opens with a young girl, bruised and bloody, running down the street of some dilapidated industrial park. She's rescued and healed (physically at least) but we soon find out she'll be screwed up and haunted for the rest of her life due to the brutal ordeal of torture she was subjected to during her kidnapping. As her parents are never found she is relegated to the care of an orphanage where she is befriended by another orphan. The two form a close bond and we hope this will lead to some degree of emotional healing.

Shift into the future where our heroine enters the home of some seemingly quiet, well educated, upper crust(ish) family, and proceeds to murder them. She phones her friend and tells her she has located the people who tortured her those many years ago. Her friend joins her and we now find out what all this was about.

That's as far as I'll go with the plot. The direction the story takes from this point on is even more peculiar. It's certainly original but not for the sake of originality in it's own right. There is method to this madness. As things unfold and the plot points come together (all the way the ironic ending) the viewer hopefully realizes this is a true cinematic experience. No warm fuzzies. No quick kill at the box office. This movie is made to endure.

Whatever others have said in regard to the brutality in this movie is totally correct. But buyer beware: This violence is accompanied by some true gravity. Until I saw this (and the other aforementioned films) I'm not certain I realized how truly pornographic the violence was/is in most mainstream movies.

This is a great piece of cinema for any who want to see that envelope pushed. But you may want to make sure you have the fortitude to see it through.",1257206400,4,2340,4.5224586288416075
3696042,5,B001MEJYAK,"France, 1971: Battered minor, Lucie Jurin (Mylne Jampano), is found wandering the streets after apparently escaping a sustained period of confinement and sadistic and systematic torture at the hands of mysterious captors whose motives remain unknown. Luci becomes a ward of the state and a resident of an orphanage where she befriends Anna (Morjana Alaoui), who slowly brings her back from a state of near catatonia to something like a sense of normality, despite the fact that Lucie is repeatedly visited and attacked by a nightmarish spectral figure who seems to be capable of inflicting actual physical harm upon her.

Fifteen years later, the Belfonds, an affluent family of French suburbanites, are settling down to breakfast when there is a knock at the door...unbeknownst to them, they are about to cross paths with an older and progressively more unhinged Lucie Jurin and before the day is done, they will understand the true meaning of obsession...

To go into further detail of the events that occur in Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" would be to rob the potential viewer ot the twists and turns of one of the most compulsive horror films of recent years. Whilst the film bears a vague similarity in tone to the ""Grand Guignol"" genre mined by the likes of ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"", to write it off as just another lurid exercise in torture and sadism is to do it a major disservice. Laugier himself has described it as the ""Anti-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Games/dp/B000EHQU3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Games</a>"" and it is a fair statement. It is the complete antithesis of Michael Haneke's detached, voyeuristic observation of the torture and murder of an Austrian family. There is no detachment here - as a viewing experience, it is visceral, shocking, emotionally draining and unremittingly brutal; but there is also a shockingly touching element of humanity which runs throughout the narrative. As a film it also goes off on tangents which are completely unpredictable and which are so cleverly plotted and paced that you cannot help but concede that you are in the hands of a cinematic master of suspense. It's genre-defying stuff. And in common with its predecessors and contemporaries in the French 'survival horror film' genre,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Tension-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000ARFPMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Tension (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontier-s/dp/B0014VPFVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontier(s)</a>&nbsp;it is, at it's heart, a film about how personal obsession can become so all-encompassing that it destroys lives. However, unlike those films, ""Martyrs"" is also a film about attempting to force personal redemption and spiritual epiphany as well as the lengths to which a person will go to protect someone that they love.

Make no mistake - this is bleak, nihilistic stuff which has more in common with the likes of Gaspar Noe's brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B00009W0U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>&nbsp;than Eli Roth's ""Hostel"" (and in common with Noe's film, the overwhelming emotion that I was left with as the final credits ran was of a profound sense of sadness and loss).

This is not the best horror film of the 2008 - for me, personally, that accolade still goes to the very different, but similarly transcendent, ""Let The Right One In"" -  but it runs a very, very close second and is a film that I recommend unreservedly for those that can stomach its harsh vision.",1255305600,3,3708,5.91044776119403

At this point I'm watching a girl relocate a body from the shower into the hallway. This is pretty intense. The gore is realistic for sure, no CGI.

The gore is top-notch. the storyline isn't bad as I'm watching this flick unfold I wish that the basic story were a little deeper than what is presented. 4 stars for the gore, 2 stars for the acting........otherwise a 3 stars flick. I've seen comparisons to ""Inside"", and yeah, while the gore level is about on par, the basic story, while interesting and at times pretty intense, is not on the same level as ""Inside"".",1254441600,,766,4.536231884057971
3696044,1,B001MEJYAK,"A very hard movie to watch.  Thoroughly unpleasant.  It is not, however, a horror movie - there is no real nervousness, or tension to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.  I think it gets classed a horror movie as it's so incredibly gory and has so many murders and torture scenes, but it's probably more accurate to say it's of the Transgressive genre.

I was told it was a challenging movie, this is true.  I was also told the story was great and the ending made it worthwhile, this is untrue.  After watching it I read some reviews in which the reviewers raved over the film and I must say I don't understand where they are coming from.  If torture is central to the story and is done artistically, then I can handle it.  But when the torture of children and young women is gratuitous, and goes on and on with no payoff then I feel I've been made to watch something that is very emotionally trying for no reason.

Without spoiling the plot I can only say the end of the movie is very weak and feels tacked on.  I kept waiting for the few frames that would pull the whole movie together and justify the previous hour of mutilation but it wasn't there.

As far as good horror movies go, get The Descent (I'm looking forward for The Descent 2).  For a good transgressive movie get Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer.

Several people working on the movie have expressed regrets that they were involved and one of the principals even committed suicide.  Overall a dark and disturbing movie, made by disturbed people, with no payoff.  Although I support freedom of expression and am glad this movie was allowed to be made I can honestly say I wish I never saw it.",1254096000,37,1665,4.395424836601308
3696045,4,B001MEJYAK,"If the past few years have taught us anything, it's that you can never underestimate the French when it comes to delivering top-notch horror movies. Like ""High Tension"" and ""Inside"" before it, ""Martyrs"" is the latest film to be subjected to a wealth of internet hype and to gain significant notoriety in the states, especially for a foreign film. But as director Pascal Laugier states in his introduction on the DVD, the film was merely an experiment in cinema and subsequently will evoke a reaction in any viewer, whether it's a positive or a negative one.

That's pretty much the story of ""Martyrs,"" a tricky film that is part revenge, part cerebral thriller. While it lacks the visceral punch of other films it's been compared to, the film is perhaps one of the most ambitious in recent years. In his film, Laugier shows many influences ranging from the works of Stanley Kubrick to even ""Hellraiser"" (a film which the director was briefly attached to remake recently), but integrates them all into a film that is unmistakably his own. Blatantly going out of his way to avoid typical film clichs and over-done visual-effects, Laugier's film presents itself as bluntly and realistically as possible. The way the film is shot is very matter-of-fact, showing the extreme violence exactly as it is. The lack of stylization is a style all its own, giving the film its own unmistakable and dreadful atmosphere. All of this is driven home with intense performances from its two leads - Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi -- who go a long way to invoke sympathy in the audience and establish a very human factor that is important to the film's credibility, especially when it reaches ridiculous heights in the third act.

Where ""Martyrs"" is heavy on the violence and dread, its problems stem from its severe lack of focus. The film shifts gears very sharply in its final act, and the build-up that precedes it is nearly destroyed. The very visceral first two-thirds of the film seem to have been forsaken for an ending that will leave many scratching their heads, wondering what kind of film they just saw. The ending itself is bold and will incite conversation long after the credits have rolled, but doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie. To put it simply, ""Martyrs"" is two movies in one, and unfortunately, its final act doesn't do the film justice. Having said that, however, ""Martyrs"" is still a bold and very unique experience in film, one that any horror fan (or anyone in general) should see for themselves in order to develop their own opinion. This is truly one film that will be interpreted differently by everyone, and in spite of its obvious flaws, won't soon be forgotten.",1253491200,4,2700,4.791845493562231
3696046,5,B001MEJYAK,"""Martyrs"" is one of the most shocking films I've ever seen (I'd rank it in the top 5 most shocking - - along with ""A Serbian Film"", ""Irreversible"", ""Salo: 120 Days Of Sodom"", and ""The Human Centipede"").  You know you are in for a shocking film when the director records a personalized DVD intro where he apologizes for making the film. If you enjoy the torture horror genre, or if you just love the feeling of impending dread, you will enjoy ""Martyrs"".  Otherwise, steer clear if you are faint-hearted or inhibited at all, because this movie is brutal and disgusting all the way through.  In fact, the plot really revolves around torture as opposed to anything else (and that's not me just being lazy in my review; the ENTIRE FILM is torture, beginning to end).  I actually felt really uncomfortable throughout the movie (in a good way). There is no protocol that this film follows, so don't expect cool party scenes, dumb teenage behavior, excessive and/or gratuitous nudity, or happy endings. You have to be tough to even get through this film. If you've got the moxie, I recommend this movie for horror fans and gore hounds alike, but brace yourself, because ""Martyrs"" is vicious, nasty, and harrowing. If you're a gore hound like me, this film definitely delivers the goods, but that's not all you get here. There's a great movie underneath all the nastiness... a movie with a deeply nihilistic rhythm that will stay with you through the next day after you watch it. Highly recommended!! 5 stars!!

***UPDATE*** - There is currently a remake of ""Martyrs"" in the works. It will be an American remake. I don't like to judge films before they are released, but seriously, this ""Americanized"" remake sounds like a bad idea. The director, Daniel Stamm (the filmmaker behind ""The Last Exorcism""), says of his upcoming remake:  ""Martyrs is very nihilistic. The American approach [that I'm looking at] would go through all that darkness but then give a glimmer of hope. You don't have to shoot yourself when it's over.""  I'm just saying, if that's the way they approach the remake, they will be betraying the original film too much. To purposefully tone down the grittiness of this film sounds like the definition of selling out to me. I say don't remake it. It's good the way it is.",1252800000,4,2279,4.754430379746835

So we had to check it out (over pizza and Little Kings).

It was not what I was expecting . . . and I mean that in a good way.  The writing, acting, directing, and even the sets were top notch.  All of which were a surprise.

********** SPOILER ALERT **************************

The movie starts out with the one girl running away from the scene of her torture as a young child -- and there are flashbacks to that time throughout the film.  There is a brief interlude at the institution where she makes a lifelong friend.  Then, ""15 YEARS LATER"" she pulls a home invasion on some nice family's home and starts executing everyone with a sawn-off double-barrel.  But then spiders chew her brain and the invisible monster girl that only she can see starts chasing her.  So she telephones her bestest friend.  ""Hey, like, can you come over?""  ""Where you at?""  ""I'm at the place.""  ""Whatcho doing at the place?  You said you was only gonna LOOK at the place!""  ""Gotta go, invisible monster girl is beating me again."" click.

So her friend gets to the place, and apparently she's never seen someone blasted with two rounds of birdshot at pointblank range before and is somewhat upset about it.  ""Hey, you think I'm crazy just like the doctors!""  ""But lookit you, cuttin on yerself and tellin' me invisible monster girl dunnit.  Yeah, yer crazy alright.""  Then she goes and offs herself.  ""Boo hoo, noooooooo.""  Then she takes a nap on the couch.

Waking up, she discovers a hidden door, which leads to a very expensive metal hatch, which leads to an underground chamber that looks like it cost more than the 2 milliion dollar home atop it.  And then things get weird.  Google ""Monarch Project"" and ""Satanic Panic"" for an idea of the theme of Act 2.  Similar in concept, but different.  A wealthy elite who control the guvmint decide to turn young girls into portals to ""The Other World"" in hopes of getting a description of it.  Even though they've had no real success with their hypothesis they continue to pour millions of dollars into it -- sorta like SETI.  Then, after systematically torturing the remaining girl until she sees ""something"" they call a big meeting and the mean turban wearing lady has her whisper secrets to her for a while.  ""Great description, let us summon the stockholders!""  And then the ending, which was confusing and nonsensical, but I suppose the writer can't go off revealing the ""secret of secrets"" to the unclean massess when he doesn't know it himself.  Realistically, it couldn't have ended any other way, but I'm still disappointed.

Yeah, there is some brutal imagery, but it was integral to the plot and for the most part understated, unlike the ""slasher porn"" of garbage like Hostel and drivel like Saw (as well as their numerous imitators).  This was a well made and thoughtful production.  Watch it in the original French with English subtitles.  Just don't watch it with the kids and Grandma.

To be honest, I haven't watched a movie that put me on edge like this in a long time. It's clearly not for the faint of heart, there is alot blood and gore. But the setup, plot and acting in the movie itself is incredible. It's defintely not predictable which is a relief to see with movies today. That being said, if you can't deal with the gore or torture, don't see it! Movies like this aren't for everyone. And it is not torture porn at all as I have heard it described. There is nothing remotely sexual in this movie. No rape, no sex, nothing. The movie explains why women are chosen. And the word martyrs does not only apply to people who willingly give their life for a cause, but also derives from the greek word Witness.

The movie is great, it's a very rare, different piece of work. Of course it's violent but it needs to be, the violence is justified anyway, the justification is certainly not an excuse... and the result is not that violent because it's always tempered with much empathy and emotion. And Laugier's direction is close to perfection.

DVD rate: ** out of 5

As a French citizen I have the original French version of this film and I can say this version released for North America and UK is NOT complete. There are many plans missing, especially during the painful bathtub scene, with the mask.
Actually the film's been cut from the beginning to the ending, with a great number of short bloody plans been taken away so nobody (especially in the US) can really notice.
Another thing, the dubbing on this English DVD is very bad, making the two girls sound hysterical, kind of out of their heads, when they're not. So I'll advise you to watch the film in its original French version.

And if you wanna check the complete version of the movie, with a complete image (because the image's been slightly reduced too), get the French DVD release on amazon.fr. There won't be no subs but what the hell... enjoy!",1248307200,,1226,4.584474885844749

From the beginning to the end of ""Martyrs"" your treated to an all out blood bath, from shootings to cutting, etc you get it all...very nice and very graphic.

The movie its self is great, its got a really creepy atmosphere, and the subject matter it pretty involved (meaning its not just a hack and slash teenage horror film)  You actually feel for the characters, and the twists and turns are very nice and unexpected.

All and all this is a great film, with an awesome story!  I wasn't disappointed and if your into suspense/foreign horror, you will love this one!",1248048000,2,907,4.52760736196319
3696073,5,B001MEJYAK,"Note: Though this review won't disclose anything after about the first third of the film, the film is sufficiently twisty that some may consider even these early points to be spoilers.

Though I'm less pessimistic about the state of horror than most fans, it's a pleasure to finally see a new movement in the genre. It's a quite a surprise, however, to see the new inspiration come from France, which has produced little of note in the last third of the twentieth century apart from ""Baby Blood"" and Jean Rollin's bizarre oeuvre. On the downside, while more than a few high quality films (Them, Inside, Sheitan, Malefique) have been produced, few have really expanded on the genre. Fortunately, this gap has been filled by ""Martyrs,"" one of the most inventive, unique horror films of the last decade. Much has been made of the film's graphic violence, but director Pascal Laugier displays true boldness in his refusal to submit to viewer expectations or to compromise his surreally bleak vision. Unsurprisingly, ""Martyrs"" is also amongst the divisive horror films in recent memory, disgusting mainstream critics while irritating the less adventurous, more gore-obsessed horror buffs. Nevertheless, for a certain portion of the horror cult, ""Martyrs"" is an experience like few others.

""Martyrs"" opens with a grainy compilation of scenes from a truly bizarre crime, where the young Lucie was held captive in a small room, chained to her chair and endlessly beaten and abused. Lucie eventually escapes through unknown means and is taken into custody, where the authorities hope to reach the disturbed child through another young girl, Anna. The film then leaps forward fifteen years, where the still disturbed Lucie (now Mylene Jampanoi) bursts into an isolated cabin home and massacres a family of four, believing the parents to be her former captors. A panicked Lucie soon calls Anna (now Morjana Alaoui), who is horrified by Lucie's rash acts and rushes to the house to determine precisely how the mad Lucie can escape this horrific situation.

Though that synopsis may seem quite straight forward, this covers only a small part of the film. As a whole, ""Martyrs"" displays a remarkably wide variety of influences and styles which are combined seamlessly. The early home invasion is blunt, classic 70s exploitation horror at its most intense, but the film soon veers of that path. Note the inexplicable naked woman that haunts Lucie (ghost, hallucination, monster? We don't know initially) whose scarred form, contortionist movements and lank hair recalls contemporary Asian horror. Similarly, after the initial massacre the story quickly leaps in bizarre, almost surreal directions before settling into a slow, agonizing final act. (The torture quotient in contemporary horror is massively overstated, but the final act of ""Martyrs"" delivers more than a little.) Most impressively, the twists and changes in tone flow organically from one another before concluding with one of the ambiguously unsettling finales in horror. This is not to say that the film is terribly plausible, even by horror standards, but the film doesn't cheat either.

Equally significant, ""Martyrs"" is sharply made in all respects. Laugier debuted with the elegant but dull ""Saint Ange,"" and here he crafts an impressive mix of style and raw brutality. Gruesome though it can be, it is also quite somber and moving, particularly during the final act. Moreover, the small cast is uniformly capable. Jampanoi generates real sympathy in a role that could easily have been terribly overwrought, while the beautiful, staid Alaoui is the heart of the film, and endures the various horrors of the film with surprising dignity. Also of note is Catherine Begin as the nameless Mademoiselle, who crafts one of the quietest, gentlest human monsters in film.

In the final acts ""Martyrs"" attempts a sort of existential and metaphysical depth rare to horror films. The film provides no real answers on this front, and many will see these attempts as pretentious, but for me these angles give the film a sort of impact beyond your average horror pic. In short, few films I've seen in recent memory have impacted me so forcefully, and demanded to be watched again immediately. Occasionally such shocks wear off, but watching the film again a number of weeks after my first viewing proved every bit as intriguing as the first time through. Few films can manage this, and if there's any justice in the horror world, ""Martyrs"" will be inducted into the canon of horror classics. Either way, it's in my canon. . .

After all, it has all the elements that make up a great horror film - there's a lot of blood, it's filled with perilous situations, and the acting is great, which is a plus.  The only problem is (and it's a big one) is how the film makes the viewer feel afterwards.  It's not a good feeling.  I, personally, felt mildly depressed.  It's like reading Nietzche, or watching ""Salo,"" or looking at a Bruegel painting - some great works of art are not meant to make a person happy, but they should make a person think.

The middle losing all pace and drags on with seemingly endless fade-ins and outs and in the process turning the viewer numb to the violence.

3696078,4,B001MEJYAK,"I'm finding it difficult to properly and sensibly review this film. No film in recent or past history has left me as disturbed and almost confused about how I feel about it as Martyrs did. I felt the film was exceptionally well made with a very original and VERY dark storyline. I'm a huge horror and gore fan, but I'm not quite sure this film fits in that category. Its something more, something that is nearly in a class by itself.

Its hard to review a movie like this, at least for me. Did I like the film? Yes. But I'm almost not sure why. Its a brilliant film, so original, so well made, but its almost like those factors are also what makes this movie so disturbing. Martyrs has taken disturbing and depressing to a whole new level. Its violent and bloody sure, but there are worse out there. But its not just the violence or blood that leaves the uneasy feeling, its the movie as a whole. The subject matter, storyline, darkness, combined with the violence and blood created probably the most disturbingly original, nearly disgusting, yet brilliantly made film I quite possibly have ever seen. See the problem trying to review this film? Its one of the most original, yet horribly disturbing films I've seen.

Unfortunately, I cannot see any replay value here. After seeing this film once regardless of how wonderfully made it is, how original it is, how different it is, I simply cannot see myself ever watching it again. Although watching it once has truly been an experience, it is just so bizarre, dark, and depressing that I would never sit through it again.

I've never felt this way about any film before, which says something for the quality and originality of it. If you've ever wanted to see one of, if not the most disturbing film ever made give this a try. Its a great movie that is almost hard to comprehend that will disturb you many days after viewing it.",1244678400,13,1878,4.550295857988166
3696079,1,B001MEJYAK,"You've read the reviews.  By now, you've probably seen the movie.  ""Martyrs"" is France's latest gorefest.  Last year, they gave us ""Inside;"" before that it was ""Frontier(s)"" and ""Haute Tension.""  This movie has caused a little more fervor because if you read most of the reviews (which are surprisingly good), you may mistakeningly lead yourself to believe this movie might make some kind of statement.  You'd be terribly wrong.

First of all, I'm confused by the title.  I thought a martyr was a person who WILLINGLY suffers death rather than renounce his/her beliefs.  This movie would have you believe that there's an organization who are intent on making martyrs out of people so--if they live--they can tell them all about the ""other side.""  Right off the bat I'm conflicted because NONE of these women did anything willingly.  They were all kidnapped and had all manners of unspeakable horrors done to them; their beliefs had nothing to do with anything.  If that's your cup of tea, (the gratuitous torture) then you'll probably need a towel to watch this movie...  But, I digress.

I decided to start the movie with the director Pascal Laugier's introduction.  I knew immediately I was in store for something bad.  Any director who will tell you to feel free to hate him for his movie certainly won't have done you any favors while he made it.  The movie starts with the escape of a 10-year old from some sort of warehouse.  This became confusing, too, because the police are shown in the movie of going into this same warehouse, yet its occupants managed to go ""undetected"" for years and continue with their tortures.  Makes perfect sense to me.  What happens in the first 15 minutes of the movie is tame compared to the last 85.  Let's just say it appears that violence against women in cinema has made another comback.  Oh, the director tries (very lamely) to add a ""twist"" to the ending, but all that did was have me laugh out loud.

Was I shocked?  No.  Was I nauseated?  No.  Was I scared?  Hell no.  Do I hate Pascal Laugier?  No.  This movie is just another staggering look at what ""horror"" means to most people now.  They don't want horror; they want blood, torture, and degredation--and LOTS of it.  I'll close by paraphrasing from William Shakespeare:  ""This movie was made by a silly man, full of sound and fury, and signifying absolutely nothing.""",1244505600,26,2367,4.737100737100737

3696092,5,B001MEJYAK,"Being so disillusioned with American cinema, I find myself resorting to foreign horror films for my fix. America has become obsessed with the thought that remakes are the way of the future, and I never can support a remake, even if I like it. What's the point? I enjoyed The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. I enjoyed the Friday the 13th remake. I enjoyed the My Bloody Valentine remake. But the same question always popped into my head- what's the point? You don't see authors taking books and rewriting them. Sadly, you do see bands going back and rerecording songs or remixing them, and it always leads me to the same thought, not to mention blatantly points out the lack of creativity in pretty much every entertainment outlet, especially in America.

What's a horror fan to do?

For some time now, I have found myself drifting to foreign cinema. I loved Audition, but I was never a big fan of Ringu or The Grudge or any of the stuff. But French horror- there was my bag of tricks. After the outstanding Brotherhood of the Wolf, I sought out more French films, and landed on the amazing Inside. And it's this broadening of my horizons that ultimately led me to Martyrs.

To be honest, I had read a lot of reviews about Martyrs, some good, some not so good, and I am kicking myself for having done so. I already knew some of the plot points and scenes... but for some reason, I was still surprised by them when they came.

Why?

Pascal Laugier has an excellent screenplay and does an even better job of getting the most that he can out of his actors and actresses. There are times in Martyrs where you will just want to break down with the characters, because it feels so REAL. It doesn't feel like you're watching a movie, it feels like you're actually right alongside these people as they go through what they do. The duo of Lucie and Anna is brilliantly constructed, and the two actresses have an amazing level of chemistry between them. The rest of the cast, which there isn't really too much of, have a lot to hold their own against.

The camera work is also nothing short of spectacular, as every shot just seems to have a life of its own, at least in my opinion. There are some shots where it looks there might be hope, only to be dashed by a completely gloomy shot. There is no room to breathe here. It's straight forward for the first half, and then the film evolves into something different, something that gives justification to that graphic violence and torture we as the viewers are subjected to.

The violence. I had heard people raving about how gory the movie was, how f'ed up the movie was, blah blah blah, but did it live up to it? In terms of brutality, oh yes, the movie was certainly brutal. But gory? Well, if you're comparing it to Prom Night, it's the equivalent of Inside. But comparing it to Inside? Not so much. There are several very bloody parts, but the movie isn't as gory as it is straight up violent. But there are reasons for it.

The film was not only scary at times, but it was also truly emotional. Not for the actors, but for the audience. I have NEVER been affected so much by a film. I felt myself wanting to cry along with the characters, because everything was just so hopeless for them. I have never had any emotional connection to a film like I did with this one, and there was just such power in it as a whole, and I was even scared by it at times, another thing that hasn't happened to me in a long time. There is one particularly sad scene where I knew what was going to happen, and I found myself not wanting to see it. THAT has never, ever happened before. This movie evokes something from the viewer, something truly relatable, even if the majority of people never go through what these poor girls do.

In the end, this film is definately not for everyone, but if you want a horror film for all ages, go see Prom Night. Martyrs is the horror fans horror film, but will more than likely appear to fans of truly moving and dramatic films as well.",1244160000,4,3996,4.389189189189189
3696093,5,B001MEJYAK,"Martyrs is an exceptionally violent, gory, gruesome and emotionaly charged movie that would leave you searching for answers behind its premise long after it's over.

Let's start with this question - what causes one to question the meaning of life? Is it the joy of living, the fear of suffering, or the anxiety caused by the fear of death? I didn't ask these questions before I sat down to watch Martyrs, but I walked away with them.

The movie starts with a scene of escape. We witness a seriously hurt girl running out of a very shady warehouse in The-middle-of-nowhere, France. The girl is semi nude, barefoot, very scared and very hurt. Yet it isn't so much the disturbing image she portrays, but her cries of desperation that draw our attention. Just this scene is enough to lock its self into one's mind and cycle in search of its meaning, but the director doesn't allow us the time to think. During the next few minutes, we are exposed to a quick run through years of the girl growing in a home for abandoned children. We see her attempt to make friends with other and her emotional struggles to cope with a secret locked deep in her mind. We can only dares to image what it may be.

Then the movie takes a sharp turn into the dark alley of the unexplained. And this is why I'm writing a review for this movie and not for one that bores its viewers with the first 15 minutes. The turn is so sharp that I found myself glued to the screen until its final scene despite the abundance of brutality and violence.

Over the next 30 minutes, viewers witness the shocking murders of a four-person family. This is where we meet the girl again except she is now grown up. And rather than seeing her well adjusted in life, we see her carrying a double barrel shotgun blasting away what appeared four innocent people. The director doesn't spare the viewers the ugliness of a murder. One can almost imagine what the students of Columbine must have felt when the two insane individuals blasted their way throughout the school.

But there is a reason behind the senseless killings. Later we discover that the mother and father were the torturers from the girl's past. And if viewers can find some justification for the gruesome killings, it soon diminishes as we discover the girl's depth of psychological disturbance. We see her slash her own body and tear at her own skin as if possessed by an unseen forse. Except we can see the force, an image of a twisted human shape (this one worse than the one in The Ring).  At that point the only way the director can bring us back to sanity is through the eyes of the only sane character in the entire movie. A friend arrives at the scense, a compassionate and courageous girl who shines with her devotion to help the lost. Her compassion is contagious, yet devastating as it becomes the leading cause of her own demise.

A lot more can be said about this movie, but I'll leave it with this: Martyrs' is unique in that it actually has an encoded meaning in the suffering of its characters. This meaning is partially revealed in the last sentence of the movie, when viewers uncover what remains after death arrives. You have to discover for yourself what the movie really means.

Highest grade for acting, exceptional characterization and twisted premise. Movies in similar fashion:
) High Tension
) Them
) Inside",1243814400,3,3348,4.568333333333333

3696095,5,B001MEJYAK,"'Martyrs' is one of those movies that slips along once in a while. You catch word of it, believe the hype about how extreme/ how shocking, it is - how it's going to make you re-evaluate horror movies forever - and you get a rush from it. The moment the film starts the rules are out and anything goes...
'Cannibal Holocaust' was maybe the last movie i saw to elicit such a response, probably because it was all i dreaded it to be and more. But most of the time the hype doesn't catch and you feel let down, not with this movie.
Playing from every sub-genre of horror from the torture gore of 'Saw' and 'Hostel', to the clinical realism of Michael Haneke and David Cronenberg to the illogical stylism of Dario Argento - film makers not only know how to work with the genre but effortlessly play with the rules - not for the sake of it but, much like Orson Welles with 'Citizen Kane',because they CAN!
 From beginning to end you have no idea what might happen next. OK so maybe a few things remind you of movies past, but seriously, the ultimate message is way behind normal horror fare and, in another sense, it's hard to find a movie so gut-wrenchingly twisted that has a point. anybody who would give this an average/ below-average review is not a horror film lover and is therefore biased. they cannot appreciate a movie within the context of it's genre and therefore have no right to an opinion.",1243814400,4,1398,4.4186046511627906

It starts as a somewhat run of the mill - if extremely bloody - example of the torture porn film genre - a seemingly deranged woman enters a home and kills all the members of its seemingly nice family. But as the movie progresses, it turns into something else - the woman was kept by this family when she was a child in a dungeon - and it has a stunning and very original twist in the final and brutal last half hour - not going to reveal too much here, but this family was part of a sect seemingly trying to decipher some of life's existential mysteries. Overall, one of the best horror films released in the last few years.",1243296000,3,776,4.25
3696097,4,B001MEJYAK,"WARNING: Pascal Laugier's film ""Martyrs"" is extremely difficult to watch.

Not since Gasper Noe's 'Irreversible' (1997) has a viewing experience been so candid and uncompromising in its brutality. That said, ""Martyrs"" is definitely one of the best horror films of 2009. With other notable ultra-violent films like High Tension (2005), Them (2006), Inside (2007) and Frontier(s) (2008), the French have been dominating the international horror scene for quite some time and ""Martyrs"" is the latest offering in the new era wave of French horror cinema that has undeniably set a new standard for the genre. The problem with these films, however, is that they're such sick cinematic puppies that lavishing too high praise could be misinterpreted by others as tantamount to endorsing necromancy, child abuse, cat-bashing, torture and rape. While ""Martyrs"" did remind me of the 'Hostel' films and could quite easily be categorized under the same 'torture-porn' sub-genre of movies, it somehow manages to find itself marked out from the rest due to its challenging and through-provoking subtext. Although I believe Laugier went a little too far with his subject matter (which many will find graphic and taboo), the film, writing, direction, and acting are superb. Unlike a lot of other movies in this genre, ""Martyrs"" creates its dread not in its controversial images of the abuse and suffering of individuals (which the 'Hostel' and 'Saw' films were notable for doing) but in the knowing that the people who perpetrate these crimes do so for transcendental reasons: there is an undeniable existential sadness that permeates both the film's plot and visuals. This is where the real terror comes into play. Without revealing too much, ""Martyrs"" (as the title suggests) has a sense of philosophy that elevates it into a league of its own dealing with interesting notions of human nature, life after death, and the will to survive. Definitely not for everyone, this film has a very powerful premise that will have most people reeling long after they've seen it.

*It's interesting to note that the people behind these crimes are often portrayed as the stuffy old Vaudeville types who drive around in European cars and congregate in large mansions in the middle of now where.",1242950400,4,2264,5.166212534059945
3696098,3,B001MEJYAK,"Every time I see a movie like Martyrs, I think about Alfred Hitchkock and his aversion to show bloody murder scenes. Was all the blood necessary? I think the gore takes something away from the movie. I give this film more credit than a film like ""Seed"" due to its plot and its theme of the nature of evil.

The movie centers around a girl who was escaped from a kidnapper after being tortured. Years later, we see her graphically shotgun an entire family, believing that they were her captors. She calls a friend for help and she is horrified when she walks into the bloody scene.

The question: How crazy is she? Later in the film, the friend finds out when things get worse and the friend becomes the latest kidnapping victim in a diabolical scheme to, well, I don't want to give it away.

In between all the blood and torture there is something more going on in this film. The very last scene, if you make it that far, is very interesting. Some critics may also indicate that this film is totally unrealistic. To them I would suggest they google ""European Children found in basement"" sometime.

Now, a lot of independent movies get lots of fan love at film festivals but only marginally live up to it's reputations.  I, however, and very satisfied and find it easily to be the equal of last year's Inside, another amazing French import.  Sharp and brutal, it is certainly not a film for everyone.  I can even understand the reported walk-outs it supposedly elicited at film festivals.  That being said, any estimation of its ferocity should be measured along side its potential audience.

The first part, the main story arc, was very good.  Also, I was surprised by the . . . departure . . . of one of the main characters only an hour into the movie.  And I liked the direction the movie went in after that.
(Sorry I'm being vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.)

However, the whole 'Martyr' aspect- the motivations, the reasons behind it all- it seemed like a stretch.  The metaphysical aspect was jarringly unnecessary.  Plus, it ground the movie to a halt.

It concerns a group of people who torture young girls to the point of death so they can try to see what's on the other side. One girl does make it, after they skin her alive, to tell the old biddy behind it about the special effects, only to have said biddy kill herself for no apparent reason but to provide a ""twist"" ending. I'm not adverse to strong movies - I highly rate ""Salo"" and ""Irreversible"", but it's nice if they have some genuine thought behind them.

No, you won't be having much fun with this one, in fact, nausea may even take hold by the time you reach it's final act.  It'll leave you in near catatonic awe, disturbing thoughts and imagery floating in the back of your head-- making you actually rationalize with yourself that ""it's just a movie.""  The regret of sinking hard earned money to torture yourself with a film that was hardly bearable to watch once-- let alone own(because you know you won't be revisiting it anytime soon, no matter what you try to tell yourself)-- becomes as shameful as the thoughts of neglect you give your grandparents in the nursing home they were forced to reside in(okay, maybe that ones a personal demon).  So why the five stars?  Because, THAT'S what a horror film should do to you!  And I haven't been absolutely destroyed by a horror film like this since The Exorcist-- which is pretty high praise considering most(including myself) feel it's the pinnacle of the genre.  The story follows two young women on a quest for revenge with nothing quite as it seems... and that's all I can say, because the less you know going into this movie-- the better!  Pascal Laugier shows why he's already one of the most sought after horror directors around right now(and has been tapped for a Hellraiser remake... I don't agree with the remake BUT, if it's gonna happen at least they got the right guy) with tight, suspenseful direction and an unflinching lens for both the highly macabre and the emotionally dramatic.  Here, Laugier and his film Martyrs is comparable to the finest designer in the world creating the most beautiful bridal gown ever seen-- the only catch is that it's made entirely from human entrails!

This is what that film failed to accomplish. Many people here have complained that the second half of this film is not that great and I admit it is a little slow, repetitive and not so violent as some may expect it to be but I believe that it was done in the best way possible which is to attack you in psychological terms, not necessarily in a physical way that many torture-porn films have come to be (not that I dislike them, quite the opposite!) Anyhow, if you've enjoy the recent French trend, I believe this is the ulitmate one, next to Inside, both which won't be topped in a long time to come.

Although I prefer Inside to Martyrs it is right up there in the greatness factor. Some individuals feel as though you have to be sick or twisted to watch movies like these I feel completely different on the subject. I do not enjoy watching others get tortured. It just seems to bring out emotions and senses that we do not get to use in everyday life. The first part was highly intense and very frightening while the second part was just extremely brutal and over the top disturbing with a high amount of gore. Fortunately I love all horror so as long as it's great I can watch anything. Martyrs is definitely not for everyone. This is only for people who can with stand anything and I mean anything. It pushed far beyond the envelope and should not be taken lightly when going into it. If you don't like Torture Porn at it's finest then stay away from this one. In my opinion this is what Saw should have been like, even though this probably wouldn't have been made without Saw. I am not usually a fan of these types. However Martyrs is an exception to the genre. With a very small plot they still made this film very interesting. The main characters were outstanding in their roles. They never over or under acted throughout the entire film. I actually think that I can't find one thing wrong with this. Overall it was perfect. I might have toned down the severity of the kills and torture, but then again it might have made it less then it was. Sometimes over the top works well and sometimes it doesn't. In this case it worked very well.

 A young girl by the name of Lucie gets kidnapped and tortured but somehow manages to escape the hell physically but never mentally. She befriends another young girl Anna in an orphanage who takes her under her wing. Fifteen years years later they go to pay revenge on Lucies perpetrators not realizing what hell is in store for them. You learn what it really means to suffer mentally and physically. What extreme measures people will go to to get answers.

 I highly recommend Martyrs. Only to those who can handle extreme and over the top gore. Do not try and watch this if your not a fan of these types of films, because I guarantee you won't like it.",1241654400,3,2344,4.444186046511628

Brutal and powerful horror thriller from France and Canada is a unique and nerve-wrecking shocker at it's best. Last year there was the excellent ""Inside"" and the quite good ""Frontier(S)"" as the tradition in French horror continues with this brand new masterpiece of the macabre. It's not just any mere torture porn movie then some would say, it's a movie that grabs you with emotion even suffering through some of the unfortunate victims they go through in hell in their eyes. It has one punch of a first half with the slaughter of a family including a young girl with an angressive second half that puts you into the pain of a sufferer going through Martyrdom even with a small bit of child abuse in the movie, it's better then your typical ""Saw"" wannabe for it's a movie about some of the horrors that the world can really be like secretly. This is half a feel-good and half a feel-bad kind of movie that never lets go in one intense ride you won't ever forget.

3696111,4,B001MEJYAK,"French horror films have been outshining Hollywood horror for the past few years. Writer/director Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" is an ultra-violent, harrowingly brutal and disquieting film about human suffering; both mentally, physically and emotionally. At first glance, one would think that this film has religious undertones but no, it takes a different road as to how it makes its point. I've read that the film was rejected by a number of large French studios, and has been rejected by a lot of French actresses. ""Martyrs"" is the new ""extreme"" in European horror and makes the French horror film ""Inside"" seem like a regular horror film.

15 Years after Lucie Jurin (Mylene Jampanoi) had escaped from an icy torture chamber in an abandoned building, this woman is bent on tracking down the instigators to her past suffering. She enlists the aid of her long-time friend, Anna (Morjana Alaoui) to find the family who tormented her and exact her revenge. Lucie seems to be haunted by violent visions that may or not be real that puts doubts about her sanity. Now, as Anna and Lucie investigate the mystery behind this family, they find that things are more sinister than they had expected and they stumble upon a secret organization bent on creating ""martyrs""...

""Martyrs"" is extremely brutal and violent. The direction by Pascal Laugier exudes a very bleak atmosphere that complements the very graphic violence onscreen. The film has a great amount of blood and gore that never lets up. At first impression, I thought it was just going to be another ""gore show"" but the film's script offers a coherent plot and all the blood and gore just revolves around its screenplay. Laugier managed to keep the proceedings grounded and interesting, while the violence gets more brutal with each second, the plight of our protagonists becomes worst and worst, I became even more enthralled by the film. The film displays the VERY dark and twisted side of human arrogance, thinking that we can have answers by sacrificing morals and stooping to acts of brutality.

The screenplay by Laugier is divided into two acts. In the first act, we would be privy to Lucie and Anna's past. Lucie is haunted by visions of an eerie and frightening naked figure, who seemingly has been tortured, abused and bent on hurting her until she finds her tormentors. The viewer challenged to question the depths of Lucie's psyche, whether her wounds are self-inflicted or done by an unseen force. It was a wise move for the direction to seed the audience's impressions and instill doubt. We also see the depths of Anna's and Lucie's budding friendship, there are subtle hints of lesbianism as well as guilt. The two characters' development mostly come in the form of flashbacks. Fear, guilt, confusion and anger are the emotions taken into exposition. The film carries a lot of emotion and surpasses the clich&eacute;s' of ""torture porn"".

The second act goes into the secrets and goals of the highly organized group obsessed with the secrets of life beyond death. The second half of the film (the last 40 minutes) goes into the experiences of Anna and the harrowing fate that Lucie had escaped from years past. Anna is beaten, forced-fed, beaten again within an inch of her life. The film also has the grand-daddy of all gore scenes that make the ""skinning"" scene in Argento's ""Pelts"" seem like a Disney flick. This half of the film is actually the part that got under my skin, as it contained disturbing sequences of violence against women. I have a strong stomach, and while it may not be the bloodiest cinematic experience I've been privy to, it certainly was one of the most brutal. Director Laugier exposition of Anna's suffering will no doubt generate sympathy from his audience.

For a film like this, the two actresses would have to perform admirably and they do; Mylene Jampanoi and Morjana Alaoui gives the performance of their careers. Amid all the brutality and violence, it would be easy to dismiss their performances and just let it all just wash over you. The two actresses manages to display all the needed emotions and if you look closely into their eyes you will witness the fear and major discomfort that they are experiencing. The film is nicely paced and has a fitting running time. I thought Pascal Laugier made the best of what he had. He did set the necessary groundwork and does give the film a satisfying climax, although I have to admit some viewers make scratch their heads as to what exactly happened.

Just what is ""martyrdom""? Is it a state of suffering in the name of religious faith or can even non-believers be martyred? Is it a mere state of catatonia? Well, the film does give you an answer but it is left to the viewers' own comprehension. It challenges the viewer to question what they have seen, and if you paid attention to the film's entirety, the answer is staring right at you. Violent, bleak and disturbing with some thought-provoking ideas to instill our emotion, ""Martyrs"" is one great horror thriller that puts Hollywood to shame.

Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]",1241136000,2,5075,4.858959537572255
3696122,5,B001MEJYAK,"I have no other choice but to give this five stars, although I feel sickened in my bones by doing so.  My hat goes off to the writer/director as he really pushed the envelope and crossed the line to the world that is completely unspeakable and horrifying.  For years I have studied horror and have watched every horror film and read every horror book I can get my hands on.  Never before have I witnessed such a piece of work that has crossed such boundaries.

I understand that one of the points for creating this, as mentioned at the before the film started, was to express freedom.  All I can say is the Marquis De Sade would be quite delighted with this work.  As much as I desperately do not want to call this art, technically it is, as I believe the art of the film is the gore and torture.

Regardless of what I have witnessed, I'm nervous but excited to see further works from this specific creator.  With Martyrs I feel new ground has been covered and I really feel like I can say I've seen it all now.",1241049600,2,1011,4.2565445026178015
3696123,5,B001MEJYAK,"This is a much better movie not knowing anything going in.  I won't spoil anything directly but some observations might guide you along enough to assist more than you may want in revealing this film's shocking and impressive series of twists.  There is your spoiler warning.

The title of Martyrs was perplexing to me until the film wisely justified its use in its final moments.  Early usage of the term meant a witness, and by that fact, combined with a strong theme of torture, the film carries its title quite well.  Martyrs even uses famous real life photographs of people's faces in a state of bliss after suffering greatly.  One that I noted was a slow slicing execution; one of the few photographed and the last actually performed in imperial China.  The execution was of a man who assassinated a Mongolian prince.  The film mistakenly, or perhaps wittingly but carelessly, indicates it was a woman who stole a hen.  I recall that those photos fascinated one man and even drove him mad.  I remember staring at them myself and feeling an odd mix of terror and interest.  I mention this because a little more than halfway through this very effective, scary, and suspenseful horror film, I suddenly became more seriously interested in its subject matter than any horror film I've ever seen.  I'm curious; what happens when we die?

I like to think of Martyrs as having four different levels.  One that introduces us to the two primary characters; Lucie, a young girl who was kidnapped and tortured in a small room without windows, and Anna, who we only know as Lucie's roommate at some kind of institution.  Lucie is tortured by a ""dead girl"" who may or may not be the driving force and cause of Lucie's masochistic behavior.  Well, at that point the film's title hasn't even been introduced to the audience.  From there the film goes forward 15 years later and we get to see Lucie's rage on full display.  That's the second level and I'm not revealing the next two. Just keep in mind, that is not really what this film is about.  It just sets the stage for something far scarier and far more compelling.  And believe it or not, far more visually gruesome.

Martyrs is actually an outstanding horror film.  I can only think two other horror films since Miike's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>&nbsp;that ran up my spine like this one did (i.e.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000IHY9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside/dp/B00125WATQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside</a>).  It is one of the few recent movies that actually justifies most of it's violence, and please trust me when I say this movie is extremely bloody.

It is written and directed by Pascal Laugier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saint-Ange-or-House-of-Voices/dp/B000ASATY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saint Ange or House of Voices</a>), a visionary I am hesitant to admit I had not previously heard of.

It is a cult classic I watch every Halloween.  I've heard that Laugier is directing a remake.  I normally cringe when my favorite films are remade and it happens all too often with horror lately, but Laugier is worthy and more than capable of handling the task.  Needless to say, I'm recommending this, but it is hardcore horror which for me makes how clever it is that much more worthy of praise.  Martyrs is a rare treat; a quality movie that creeps under your skin.",1240963200,10,4014,5.918402777777778
3696124,3,B001MEJYAK,"As a young girl, Lucie was able to escape certain death as she was held captive and tortured onto the brink of death. Now, fifteen years later, she seeks revenge on those who hurt her emotionally, physically, and mentally. The only person she's ever been close to is, her friend, Anna. As Lucie leaves a path of destruction and mayhem on her quest for revenge, Anna is dragged along to help pick up the pieces. In an odd twist, Lucie is haunted by a woman whose sole purpose is to hurt her, but only shows up after Lucie unleashes all of her built up pain and anger. Anna begins to question Lucie's sanity as things take a turn for the worst. That is until Anna discovers the chained up woman in the basement...

Martyrs wasn't really what I was expecting at all. I was expecting something along the lines of Haute Tension and  l'intrieur since it's classified as a French horror film. I was left with something completely different as Martyrs tends to be on a level all on its own. It is extremely brutal. I've heard it is more along the lines of Irrversible, but since I haven't seen that I can't really elaborate on it. It left with me with the same feeling The Girl Next Door did. This uneasiness that made me question sitting through the movie again any time soon. Yet, at the same time, not many horror films are capable of making me feel this way. So I'm not really sure if I should view this as a flaw or a virtue. It also reminded me of Hostel, at times, especially the closing act of the film. Before people grown or anything, let me explain. It reminds me of Hostel if it was done correctly and focused on young girls the entire time. For me, Hostel had an excellent idea but was executed the wrong way. Martyrs pretty much brought what I had in mind for that film to life and did it better. Martyrs is definitely its own film, but its influences and/or homages seem to stick out like a sore thumb to someone who watches a lot of films and/or reviews them.

On first viewing, I can't really say if I liked why this was being done to these girls. It is explained and as it makes sense on one hand, it seems a bit farfetched on the other. It may grow on me during repeat viewings, but it didn't really sit well with me this particular time. The brutality in the film isn't always what is shown on screen either. There's a scene where this bulky guy is just beating the snot out of this girl. Just punching her in the face repeatedly as hard as he can. You can't really see the damage he's doing to her, but you can hear it and you can tell he's giving her quite a beating. During one of the more gruesome parts, the sound almost completely fades away and the shot relies completely on the girl's facial expressions as you see her begin to shake. As disturbing as it was, it was interesting seeing anguish portrayed a bit differently as the film went on.

Martyrs definitely delivers in more than one department. Those who are looking for another sick, twisted, and brutal French horror film won't be disappointed and let's just say the film lives up to the meaning of its title. While the film is done well and I do plan on owning it, it's not exactly something I can just pop in at any time and watch it. Just be advised that this is probably the most brutal and disturbing French horror film (since Haute Tension anyway) to date. There's plenty of scenes to cringe at and scream at in this film.

I had heard alot of hype about this movie for almost a year before actually being able to see it, and it definately lived up to all the hype and more! Very intense, fast paced, and ultra violent.

3696128,5,B001MEJYAK,"First I have to say that all the hype about the violent nature of this movie was far too exaggerated. I`m an horror film fan since the tender age of 16 (now I`m 37) and I`ve seen hundreds of films that were more grotesquely and perversely violent than this one. On the other hand I have to admit that I saw the German rental DVD and I`m not quite sure if the film was cut or not. There was little information on the net and from the film itself it was not possible to tell if the German censors had again a field day with that movie, because even after 60 years after the Nazi regime art has no free right in this country to tell, or to show what it has to show, but that`s a different story. In May I can tell you more about the nature of the film, when I get the unrated American edition on DVD from Amazon and can compare it to the German one. Even if the movie I saw was cut, it`s still a far cry from things like Saw and Hostel, especially when it comes to term of the quality and the story of the film. What started with Alexandre Aja`s film High Tension in 2005 and found it`s following with Alexandre Bustillo`s and Julien Maury`s Inside in 2007and Xavier Gens` movie Frontier(s) in 2008 French horror directors have delivered films that stand mountain high above the genre outings from the States. I hope I allowed to quote from the DVD review of that movie from the Fangoria home page that these films are ""...a shining artistic beacon to the rest of the genre world."" There is nothing more to say about this.",1238630400,6,1519,4.205479452054795
3696129,1,B001MEJYAK,"AS AN ADDENDUM: My review contains some serious spoilers. Read at your own risk. I use the term ""torture porn"" not as a pejorative, but as a commonly accepted term used to describe films of this genre.  I'm not going to waste time here discussing the merits or value of the term.  I'm not a ""professional"" critic - nor do I have to be.  And I'm not trying to prove how hard I am by listing my repertoire of violent films watched.  The following is simply an unpretentious opinion, nothing more.

The horror genre is my favorite film genre. I've been watching them since I'm a kid. I can remember seeing mainstream movies like ""Halloween,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and a host of other more obscure films - some of which were thought of as extreme in their day. But after watching a number of ""torture porn"" films lately, I can safely say that I know I'm not desensitized to violence. Torture porn seems to be the nouveau chic, avant-garde subgenre of horror films lately, but these films really have very little to do with horror.  I shouldn't even call it a subgenre.  This is a mistake.  I follow many horror movie sites and magazines, all of which covered this film.  It has about as much in common as Poison does Slayer, if talking about metal bands.  To be honest, try as I may, I absolutely hate the genre! I like my horror films to have a story with a bit of violence thrown in. Torture porn has violence with a little bit of a story thrown in.... maybe... probably not...but just maybe.

I was really looking forward to this film.  So to be fair and to develop an honest opinion, I actually watched all of this film, and I can honestly say it's the most repulsive film that I've ever seen. Seriously! I'm about as liberal as it comes with art, but I thought for the first time that I was watching something that borderlined the obscene. It was really that grotesque - and not in the fun way. For the only the second time in my 35 years, I felt truly disgusted and sickened by a film - the other during the rape scene in ""The Last House on the Left "" remake (during which time I never heard an audience get so quiet... I suspect they were all shocked, too).  I've since seen other shocking films, too, but my opinion of this film still stands.

The movie spends the vast majority of the time shocking the user first with extreme violence and then endless amounts of torture, only to throw in a Shyamalan-esque ending at the very end.  To me, it did nothing to redeem the film, which spent too much time on the torture and violence.  ""High Tension"" did the same thing.  There's a formula here apparently:  throw in as much extreme violence as possible, and at the end, give the viewers a twist as a chaser.  I thought ""High Tension"" was bit cleverer with this, but after watching a woman get tortured for so long in this film and so graphically, the ending failed to outshine what had preceded it.  I've seen other films that used the violence as a plot element.  In this genre, it has become the main element.  It's the centerpiece, and makes all other element seem ancillary.

I have a hard time seeing the artistic value of movies like this. It may be there (I'll give it that much), but I just don't see it.  I'm of the opinion that the violence simply overpowers the movie's story. It's a subtle as a sledge hammer to the face. It's so shocking that people talk more about the violence of the film than its story, which, I think, shows the holes in the argument that the violence helps to move the plot along. What ever happened to subtlety in films? Apparently we all have the attention spans of 2 years olds and have to be constantly shocked into paying attention. The ending didn't leave me with any epiphany. I thought...wow...the violence is finally over....roll the credits....get me back the horror of the real world!  There' s nothing life-affirming, enlightening, or beautiful about ""Martyrs"" that hasn't been said elsewhere in more eloquent ways - either in print or film.  Making excuses for the gratuitous amounts of violence seems to be a poor attempt at rationalizing.

SPOILERS BELOW!!!
""Martyrs"" has a bit of a plot, one that is placed in between the blood, cutting, beating of women, flaying people alive, force feeding people, etc. The plot is this, and only this: a cult believes that martyrdom is possible outside of religious belief and that a person can have visions of the afterlife if they suffer martyrdom. That's it. Period! A cult that wants to know what's after death tortures people to the point of martyrdom to find out what's after death. This might sound like a cool idea, but it is overpowered by the extreme level of violence of the film, which is so incredibly realistic that it's amazing! The French have a knack for producing the most realistic and bloody torture porn films - for good or for ill.

I've seen plenty of real life violence and bloodshed, so I'm not of a delicate disposition.  I just honestly don't see the appeal of the genre. To me, it is a proof of the law of diminishing returns. People are constantly looking for new kicks. Surrounded daily by real horrors, people are no longer scared by traditional horror films. In comes torture porn to fill the need and to push the limits. It's S&M film, taken to deadly and grotesque limits. To me, there's nothing scary about seeing someone skinned, repeatedly beaten, force-fed, or cut over and over - especially women. To me, ""SAW"" started the modern incarnation of this genre (I liked that film, btw), and now people are trying to outdo each other with the level of gore and shocking violence. I expect more than violence in my horror films. Maybe this is your film; it wasn't mine. I'm sure it will appeal to fans of ""Salo"" and other examples of cultural detritus - although I think this film has more in common with ""Saw"" than ""Salo.""  I don't see the art in any of these films. Would people say the same thing about, let's say, a realistic depiction of death camps, one that shows everything from internment to the actual mass murder? What's next a torture porn movie about Mengele?  Instead of capturing the terror of horror films and distilling it into its most primal form, it looses its focus and produces a film that stands solely on the broken legs of extreme gore and violence without having a soul (a sound plot).

These films are pushing the bounds of hard ratings.  At the rate that they are going, I suspect they'll be in the 18-only section before too long.  These films are utterly doomed to serve a niche market, if not fail altogether.  I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of people, even horror fans, don't want to be traumatized by what they see.  Horror is great because it's fantasy, it's not real.  It provides escapism, a little bit of fear, some excitement, maybe even some humor.  But films that provide true repulsion, the totally grotesque, and even the vile stand as stark contrasts.  They blur the line between entertainment, which is what horror is, and just plain disturbing imagery.  Try as I might, I have a hard time seeing the beauty in violence for violence sake, in any medium.  It's too real and too disturbing.  I feel like I'm strapped into a chair undergoing the ""Ludovico Technique.""",1238544000,49,7269,4.547198772064466
3696130,5,B001MEJYAK,"This is truly a remarkable horror experience. A very rare catch that could only be made in Europe.

Young Lucie escapes from captivity and grows up tormented by her experiences. She is continuously haunted by a creature that preys on her. At the institution where she lives, she befriends another girl, Anna. Fast forward 15 years and Lucie discovers the people who tortured her as a child. She gets her revenge with the help of Anna... who's in for the discovery/experience of a lifetime.

It all seems pretty vague, I know, but I do not want to spoil the ending - which is by far one of the most fascinating endings I've ever seen - because it is, perhaps, the most ironic ending ever for a horror film!

The philosophical nature of the plot - that becomes clear halfway through is beautifully written and calculated and the Mademoiselle character is truly frightening! Contrary to what people may say, the violence and gore presented here - although over the top - is NOT gratuitous. They serve the narrative. The violence and gore are essential to what the characters in the plot are trying to achieve. And it is up to the viewer to endure it.

The ending will simply leave everyone with their mouth open... and make clear the ultimate irony.

This is a film that, somehow, could never have come up in Hollywood. The Europeans have done it again!

3696131,5,B001MEJYAK,"Terrifyingly harrowing, sickening, hopelessly bleak, and very cruel, this French bad boy is an evil, evil film that, I promise non-believers, will utterly destroy the foundations of their pre-assumptions, biases and expectations. In that case, one should proceed with great caution in regards to viewing it. I believe Pascal Laugier, who was apparently depressed and suicidal while directing this, has achieved what could be the ultimate point of horror cinema, or any material that deals with horror for that matter: utterly dark without any single trace of snide mockery or humor, let alone a single ray of light; unflinchingly looking at human depravity, misery and cruelty by virtue of effectively capturing what could be every single pain known to mankind without any remorse and apology, and abandoning any concept of hope and redemption; indeed ugly pessimism at its finest: and doing all of that on philosophical and humanistic terms: what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to truly suffer? How does one can transcend material life? How does death look like? Is there a way to find truth? Good god, Nietzsche would be proud. With the abundance of gore along the veins of ""Clive Barker's Hellraiser"" (which is now understandably a film that Laugier is currently remaking) and gut-wrenching violence that is plain razor-sharp and thoroughly ugly, but that of which leaves a surprising emotional resonance and sadness on its sufferers, unlike the cold detachment from the characters in American torture porn films like the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" series, ""Martyrs"" works far differently from its aforementioned counterparts: it actually has something to say, albeit from an existential angle, and it is cathartic and emotional. Nonetheless, witnessing it is a very satanic experience, though that is the point: horror that is highly effective transgresses beyond showing superficial pain, flimsy terror, nonsensical idealism that is tired and realism that is made up of mere platitudes. In ""Martyrs"", every single drop of blood is significant down to its transcendental, even ethereal, moving conclusion.",1237852800,12,2114,5.332335329341317
8321038,2,B001MEJYAK,"After so many reviews of this being the greatest horror picture ever, or most gruesome, and having seen the director Pascal Laugier's ""The Tall Man"", which I absolutely loved, I spent a bundle and bought a DVD of Martyrs.  Disappointing!  Not much of a story.  Just a lot of blood, guts, and torture, seemingly endless.  I need a better story, with some twists and turns.  ""Night of The Living Dead"" was  a hundred times better, as was ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Last House On The Left""  (all the originals, not the awful remakes).  You can keep your torture porn.",1516838400,,572,4.65
8321039,5,B001MEJYAK,"Horror, noun: an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust.

No film on the planet embodies and captures the true essence of horror better than the French-Canadian film, Martyrs. You'll be hard-pressed to find a film more difficult to sit through than this one; it is truly horrifying, shocking, and disgusting. Everything about this film is brilliant, from its writing to its acting, directing, music and sound design, special effects, makeup, set design, literally everything.

Martyrs starts off making you think it's going to be a ghost story. Then it turns a 180 and goes in another direction, seeming like it's going to be a story about rescuing a victim of incredible torture. THEN it flips THAT on its head and goes in an entirely other direction and becomes a film about torture itself and the boundary between complete, total pain and enlightenment, exploring the barrier between life and death. The film keeps you guessing constantly and offers one gut-wrenching surprise after another.

Stringing all this together are some of the most brutal, twisted scenes of any horror film to date. The acting, special effects, and directing come together to create a sense of utter hopelessness. It's hard to say more without spoiling things.

The culmination of all this is an ending and overall underlying concept that will make you question your very existence and what is really lying below the surface of our reality. Not only is this film beyond words when it comes to how truly horrifying and crushing it is to experience, but it also has running through it a spinal cord of high-concept intellectualism that challenges our understanding of life itself.

As a quote from Mad Movies on the blu-ray case reads, ""It is simply the perfect movie... We call this a masterpiece.""

If you watch this film, I guarantee you it will leave its mark on your psyche and scar you for months. It's earned itself the title of my favorite horror film of all time, because I will only be able to stomach watching it a handful of times within my lifespan. I saw it around seven years ago and I'm just now working up the nerve to watch it a second time to show it to a couple of friends who have respect for true horror as I do. Martyrs is a true masterwork, the ultimate example of what horror is capable of in the right hands. I guarantee you will never forget it.",1515369600,3,2354,4.7153284671532845
8321040,5,B001MEJYAK,"I loaded up on discount movies at the local Blockbusters that were going out of business, and this was one I bought. I had rented it once, watched it twice, and had to own it.
A lot of noise gets made about how brutal this movie is (violence-wise), and it IS a very violent. And it's a fair warning to anyone on the fence about seeing this movie. If you're squeamish at all, Martyrs is probably/definitely a horrible choice for you.

I like movies that leave room for viewer interpretation, because it allows me to experience and analyze the movie on two grounds: the actual actions in the movie, and my personal interpretation of the events of the movie and the emotions it evokes. This is one of those movies. I've seen a lot of reviews (especially American reviews) that equate this movie with being nothing more than an endurance test for the viewers ability to sit through brutality. Personally, I found more meaning in watching this movie than a simple ""torture porn endurance test"". For me, watching this movie was a very personal and emotional experience. At the risk of over-sharing/TMI'ing..I definitely experienced a lot of abuse (of different types) through out my childhood-to-teens & even some into my 20's. Watching this movie was a (surprisingly) cathartic experience. It delves into the hopelessness and the feelings of being completely trapped in a violent/abusive atmosphere. I felt, more than any other piece of art I've experienced, this movie really nailed the essence of being trapped in an abusive environment. It accurately depicted the cold sociopathic behaviour of serial abusers who lead otherwise normal, socially-acceptable lives. If you've lived through those kinds of extreme circumstances, this movie will draw out any emotions you thought you had buried (and some you may have even forgotten you had buried).

For people who grew up in (or lived in) abusive environments: If you can stomach some very violent imagery, and you need a good, cathartic experience to help you get some of those bottled emotions out...this is a good piece of art to help achieve that end. I watch Martyrs a couple of times every year, when memories get to be too much and I need something to help me coax out bottled up emotions. Watching the movie doesn't necessarily make me feel like the world is some great place, or that there's an end to suffering just over the horizon (indeed, the ending of Martyrs is VERY bleak), but it DOES help in the sense that it puts words/images to emotions that can feel otherwise impossible to deal with.

This is one of my favourite movies, precisely for the reasons I stated above. My opinion of it is very personal, and very biased because of that. It IS very hard to watch. But I think the therapeutic value is second-to-none (or can be, depending on the viewers intent going into the movie).",1512950400,,2843,4.809815950920245
8321041,5,B001MEJYAK,"Not as disturbing as I had prepared myself for it to be. I started this movie thinking it was going to be torture porn or some B-movie going for some shock value. Turns out this is just a really good movie and the ending is incredible, one of the best I've seen in awhile.",1512950400,,272,4.055555555555555

8321044,5,B001MEJYAK,A rare gem.  Far beyond the pale.  Ferocious in its lack of sympathy.  Exceeded my expectations in its spiral into darkness.,1506556800,,124,4.809523809523809
8321045,1,B001MEJYAK,This makes me mad. This isn't the original film. This is a remake and a rip off of a truly amazing movie. Find the ACTUAL movie. 100% better.,1504828800,,141,4.071428571428571
8321046,2,B001MEJYAK,"This movie was a huge waste of my time and I was so bored while watching it, I had to force myself to get through it. As another reviewer wrote, this movie is nothing but torture porn. It's not scary. It's just gruesome. Even though I don't have an issue with torture in horror movies, there wasn't much depth to the movie and the plot didn't make much sense.. There was very little dialogue and the second half of the movie is basically ongoing torture scenes and not much else. Maybe I am desensitized to torture in horror movies, but just seeing someone getting repeatedly tortured without a clear reason why doesn't do much for me. And the ending was very ambiguous. I'm only giving it two stars because of the realism of the torutre scenes, but other than that this movie was trash.",1503619200,,787,4.472222222222222
8321047,1,B001MEJYAK,"I was so excited to finally get the courage to watch this film. I thought it was a major let down. I did not connect with any of the characters or storyline. I actually think it was more humorous. The plot was all over the place, not believable or relatable. The gore was pretty bad but everything else was underwhelming.",1496188800,,321,4.366666666666666
