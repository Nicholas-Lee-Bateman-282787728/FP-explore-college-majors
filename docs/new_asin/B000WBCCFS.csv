2963888,2,B000WBCCFS,"This film had so much potential.

Think of the plot: a madman is threatening to blow up a nuclear bomb in Washington D.C. unless a group of brillant men and women can solve his riddles.

They have until sun-up.

Sounds like a nice thriller right?

All night the bag guy asks questions and if the group answers correctly, they win points. They have to earn so many points to stop the bomb.

The first mistake was casting Stephen Baldwin as one of the geniuses.

The second mistake was writing a script that has almost nothing to do with the plot.

Even Tom Sizemore as the villain couldn't save this low-budget fiasco.

So much promise with nowhere to go.",1248912000,6,654,4.483050847457627
2963889,2,B000WBCCFS,"I didn't know what to expect from ""The Genius Club"". It seemed to be something of a ""love it or hate it"" movie, judging from some reviews and its IMDb rating. Knowing it was made by Tim Chey, who made the amateurish rapture movie, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone/dp/B0001EQI7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone</a>"", I feared it might be another badly made evangelistic movie. On the other hand, the premise, some of the world's (or at least the USA's) smartest people gather to find the solution to world problems in a day, sounded intriguing. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do much with the premise. Not much happens in two hours except for the discussions of the ""genius club"". The riddles start out easy (why is toner ink so expensive?) and progress into questions of war, famine and the existence of God.  Movies based on dialogue can be great, if they're smart and well written, but ""The Genius Club"" is rather pedestrian, the answes to the riddles often obvious. None of the characters come off as geniuses, nor does the screenwriter. The discussions are more like those of a randomly selected group of reasonably intelligent people. Towards the end there are some character development and some of the actors do a good job (Baldwin is surprisingly good) while some don't. The question of God's existence gives a hint there's Christian money and ideas behind this film, but it's not too preachy. On the other hand, the arguments on both sides are the same old, same old, including the tired old Descartes and C.S Lewis arguments, not exactly the stuff of genius. It certainly doesn't ""prove God exists"" as the DVD cover would suggest.

So, it it worth watching? It's hard to say. I think ""The Genius Club"" wants to be, tries to be and thinks it is, smarter than it really is and that if you're interested in philosophy the film offers nothing new. On the other hand, some people loved it, so you may want to give it a chance. I would have given it 2 stars if I could but since I can't, and three stars seem to much, it gets two stars from me.",1237680000,6,2093,4.827298050139276

However, I felt that there was too much going on and not enough focus. The cover said prove God exists, but that didn't really seem to be the theme of the movie at all.  It was more about why do bad things happen to good people? I think the movie could have been better.  It was almost as if they had a great idea but failed to edit the script before arriving at the final product.  At the end of the day, I'm not sorry I bought this movie.  I will continue to buy anything Stephen Baldwin participates in.  I was a huge fan of his before he became a Christian.  As I got out of college and began developing my faith, Stephen Baldwin also became a Christian and starting making Christian movies.  It kind of was cool to witness that and see the difference it not only made in his life but even the movies he makes.  I love Stephen Baldwin and feel he is making a difference in Hollywood .

This is a wild and smart film. I ended the film feeling exactly what others felt that I've discovered something very important. How often to do we ever discuss the meaning of life in a profound way.

What I loved the most was the breaking of taboos and the internal struggles with each character and how that related to the question posed by Armand (the terrorist or revolutionist or whatever they call him).

The acting was insanely good, especially the actor who played the American President. Really loved each of the character's unique take on the world's problems. And the actor who played Armand was brilliant. Everyone did well.

The discussion on God was phenomenal. When does a discussion on Hume ever take place in a movie? The film really draws you in and, for everything it's worth, never lets up. Every viewpoint is shown and discussed intelligently and rather remarkably.

2963893,5,B000WBCCFS,"I would recommend this to anyone because it is challenging and you might learn from it.  Most of this dark movie had intense scenes; I found it to be overly profound since it discussed a lot of serious issues and conspiracies.  Here's what I can recite from memory:

Why hasn't there been a cure found for cancer?
Why does toner ink cost so much?
Why are there starving people in the world?
If you were a dictator, what is the first thing you would do?
What is the meaning of life? (they mentioned God a little here and that was it for the whole movie)

There were so many characters to keep track of, it might be overwhelming for some, but they all contributed equally and you got to see many shades of their personality.  I enjoyed this movie very much and cried a lot at the end (good actors).",1229385600,4,796,4.28
2963894,5,B000WBCCFS,"This movie is amazing!  A must-see for anyone!  Although the film consists mainly of dialog, it held my attention completely.  People portrayed as average citizens except for their high IQs are brought together by the government at the request of an unstable man threatening to blow up Washington D.C.  They are forced to answer questions he asks, all of which are questions all humanity seeks answers for.  It challenges all of us to not settle for mediocre lives, but to rise above, face and be the answer to the problems of our world, emphasizing love and forgiveness.  The film's cast did an excellent job portraying people from all walks of life with whom any viewer could identify.  This movie challenged me to examine myself as it went along, and I must say that by the end of it, I was changed to the point of knowing where justice was due and yet feeling compassion for the man who was threatening evil.

2963896,4,B000WBCCFS,"I have to admit to being an emotional person and this to better explain why I liked this movie. The premise of this movie is quite weak: a scientist with an IQ of over 200 builds a bomb and threatens to blow Washington DC to smithereens unless the President brings together all the people he can find with IQs over 200 to an abandoned building in DC to play a game. The game consists of a Q & A with questions all relating to solving the world's problems. If the participants can amass 1,000 points before dawn the next morning, they can walk and DC is safe. At times, the discussion was reminiscent of university lectures I've attended but as the questions progressed to being more moral, the feel of the movie changes.

That said, I can say that it is the argument that really shows the intelligence of ""The Genius Club."" The second half definitely clinched it for me as the story progresses into the lives of each participant, woven into the Q & A session. The majority of the stories are emotionally charged and ranges from the woman dying of cancer, confronting the President on why he cut back on cancer research spending to the discussion of faith in God and being atheist.

I truly underestimated this movie and I have to say that when I walked out of the theater, I was a pleasantly surprised, sopping mess.",1220486400,20,1316,4.479166666666667

2963899,3,B000WBCCFS,"This movie had a great potential plotline, some great actors and what looked to be an adequate budget, but ultimately failed to live up to its potential. Anyone who is a Tom Sizemore or Stephen Baldwin fan won't be disappointed with their performances. Jack Scalia's character was written to be rather one-dimensional and he did the best he probably could with the script he had to work with. Although she doesn't get top billing, Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) puts in a short but decent performance as well. Jacob Bonnema was one of the main characters in the movie, but hardly has any lines at all, despite the fact that he portrays the only identifiable Christian in the room (this was obviously made and marketed as a Christian themed movie). A Google and IMDB search for him shows nothing, although he does share the same last name as the producer of the movie (Arch Bonnema) who himself has a bit role in the film as the President's Chief of Staff. Just a coincidence, I'm sure.

The lead role in The Genius Club is actually portrayed by Huntley Ritter. His character is some sort of Homeland Security Agent with an IQ that he hints is higher than everyone else in the room. Honestly, his performance fell rather flat in my view, and his occasional regression into a Southern accent was bad enough to trash what little believability that existed for his character. His performance was awkward and even difficult to watch at times, and that ended up being a big part of the reason this movie doesn't score higher in my opinion.

As for the plot, Tom Sizemore plays an evil scientist turned game-show host, where the big prize is NOT getting blown up by a nuclear bomb. A group of Sizemore's hand-picked ""genuises"" are rounded-up by the government and whisked-away to a dingy wharehouse in Washington, D.C. at Sizemore's insistence (first rule of terrorism... Never bargain with terrorists. Oops!). The ""contestants"" are then asked a seemingly random list of questions, most of which are philosophical in nature. Few of the contestants seem to agree on anything most of the time, and the whole fiasco quickly breaks down into more of a battle of egos than a battle of minds.

I won't give away the ending, because it represents one of the more redeeming qualities of this movie. The ending has a great concept behind it that I wish had been brought-up earlier in the film. For those of you expecting for some sort of evangelical sermon about Jesus Christ to break out, you will be sorely disappointed. Very little of the debate in the movie centers around God, let alone Christianity. It really is more philosophical in looking at man's inhumanity towards man and why things in the world are obviously unfair. It is definitely thought provoking, almost exciting at times and will stimulate your mind long afterward, whatever your particular religious beliefs are (or aren't).

One correction to the ""official"" description given of the movie... There actually ARE some ""extras"" on the DVD, including a director commentary audio track and a behind the scenes short that runs about 20 minutes long. There are also some outtakes and other stuff from the cutting room floor that was left out due to time constraints. Also, there are the inevitable trailers for other movies the same studio has made. Probably worth watching, if you enjoyed the movie. I consider this film worth watching, although I was definitely hoping for more from it than it actually delivered though.",1355097600,,3478,4.85016835016835
2963900,3,B000WBCCFS,"It is a good movie to talk over with unbelievers. It is kind of slow to begin with but if you stick with it , it is worth it and is a good conversational starter. Beware of where you purchase this. This disc was damaged but there was no one to contact to exchange through amazon. Was not worth paying the shipping costs.",1350691200,,320,4.095238095238095
2963901,5,B000WBCCFS,This message of the movie is deeper than many realize! We are so wrapped up in the day to day life of earning the dollar bill (the issue of capitalism) that we have forgotten what the purpose of life is. None of us is taking anything with us when we leave this world. The writer is brilliant in asking us to think about why we are here on earth. The mad man is actually quite right in the power of the military and the pharmacetical industy. We as human beings can spend our lives getting along with each other instead of killing each other. We haven't learned from the past because we keep repeating the same nonsense. We blow things apart and then rebuild. If we truly go forward as the message of the film and help each other what an incredible world it would be.,1338940800,5,766,4.2534246575342465
2963902,1,B000WBCCFS,"I will say one thing, the unintentional laughs I got from this movie did make it worthwhile. It's by no means a masterpiece by any stretch of the word and and that hammy acting and cliched line readings are clear evidence of that. No, this movie fails miserably because of one thing, there were no geniuses involved. A note to the producers, extremely high IQs like those shown in the movie aren't possible. The entire IQ test fails once you reach 200 and literally you can't go any higher but for the normal everyday Joe Sixpack it's more than adequate.

After the chess scene I knew this movie was a winner. It's a pretty poor example of a chess champion that gets caught in a fool's mate. But I guess that's because he wasn't a genius. After all, even novice players learn about that move and how to block it. That move is practically part of the learning process.

But no, we're faced with unconvincing characters, poor examples of geniuses and some of the worst questions ever devised. At best the questions and solutions sound like the ramblings of some conspiracy nut or somebody that doesn't know how most things in this world actually work. In the end, we're left with a jumbled mess that gets praise simply because it's a ""Christian"" movie. This movie failed when first shown, then the producers played up the Christian message and suddenly you're left with a movie that every Christian I've spoken to loves and praises the message.

I'm sorry, but this movie is simply not a good one. Take away the, admittedly very thin, message and you're left with something that should be regulated to the $1.00 bin at your local Wal*Mart.",1296950400,,1637,4.637931034482759
2963903,5,B000WBCCFS,"I loved this film. I was also taken by surprised by how good it was. It really draws your attention. At first the beginning seem boring, but after 15 mins, it gets good.

2963905,1,B000WBCCFS,"I find it ironic that the homeland security guy waxed eloquently on the dumbing down of our society to his doctor while his wife was dying of cancer.  This film is beyond dumbed down.  The dialogue is so cliched as to be a caricature of itself.  The acting is so abysmal that there isn't a believable character in the bunch.  The premise is just plain stupid.

I wanted to like this film.  I couldn't get past the first fifteen minutes.  My entire family concurred that we couldn't waste another minute of our lives, regardless of what the message of the film turned out to be.

Sorry, Cloud Ten, but after the Left Behind fiasco and this, perhaps film production isn't really your thing.  Take note of the work the Kendrick brothers are doing to see how to create a film that much more closely approximates a quality that you can be proud of.

Perhaps the film would go over with an immature crowd or young kids.  Though my fifteen year old daughter was the first to verbalize her dislike of the film.

The Genius Club is another sad example of poor Christian production values. We deserve better.",1272326400,5,1098,4.517766497461929
2963906,3,B000WBCCFS,"This movie has a lot of potential and seems very interesting, but I got really bored watching it. So frequently it was just an angry guy screaming at a bunch of people who were just arguing and wanting to leave and the asthmatic lady going into yet another asthma attack and falling on the floor while the economics professor has some random cigarette in his mouth (unlit). I think the script was awful, generic and, at times, cliche and uncomfortably sentimental. I think the group would have been a little different if they believed it with some more tension. I'd certainly imagine they'd get a little more focused and down to business than bicker the entire time, but it is a theoretical situation so... I'll give them a break.
The beginning could have been set up better as well as a better sense of real time throughout, especially toward the end when apparently they had only 2 minutes left yet definitely over 2 minutes of dialogue transpired. This is certainly no '24.'
What I do still like about this film is the premise and that the questions are thought-provoking, certainly more so than some of the latest trash out there--issues about politics, religion, business--basically everything NOT to bring up on a first date. While no issues really have good answers even outside of the scope of this film, there's not enough time within it to explore even one of the issues presented let alone all of them that were broached. There is a decent balance between viewpoints, I suppose. Decent enough, at least.
Overall, I recommend it as something to casually watch, or maybe for a Philosophy Club meeting.",1261699200,8,1610,4.774193548387097

3198396,3,B000WBCCFS,"This movie had a great potential plotline, some great actors and what looked to be an adequate budget, but ultimately failed to live up to its potential. Anyone who is a Tom Sizemore or Stephen Baldwin fan won't be disappointed with their performances. Jack Scalia's character was written to be rather one-dimensional and he did the best he probably could with the script he had to work with. Although she doesn't get top billing, Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) puts in a short but decent performance as well. Jacob Bonnema was one of the main characters in the movie, but hardly has any lines at all, despite the fact that he portrays the only identifiable Christian in the room (this was obviously made and marketed as a Christian themed movie). A Google and IMDB search for him shows nothing, although he does share the same last name as the producer of the movie (Arch Bonnema) who himself has a bit role in the film as the President's Chief of Staff. Just a coincidence, I'm sure.

The lead role in The Genius Club is actually portrayed by Huntley Ritter. His character is some sort of Homeland Security Agent with an IQ that he hints is higher than everyone else in the room. Honestly, his performance fell rather flat in my view, and his occasional regression into a Southern accent was bad enough to trash what little believability that existed for his character. His performance was awkward and even difficult to watch at times, and that ended up being a big part of the reason this movie doesn't score higher in my opinion.

As for the plot, Tom Sizemore plays an evil scientist turned game-show host, where the big prize is NOT getting blown up by a nuclear bomb. A group of Sizemore's hand-picked ""genuises"" are rounded-up by the government and whisked-away to a dingy wharehouse in Washington, D.C. at Sizemore's insistence (first rule of terrorism... Never bargain with terrorists. Oops!). The ""contestants"" are then asked a seemingly random list of questions, most of which are philosophical in nature. Few of the contestants seem to agree on anything most of the time, and the whole fiasco quickly breaks down into more of a battle of egos than a battle of minds.

I won't give away the ending, because it represents one of the more redeeming qualities of this movie. The ending has a great concept behind it that I wish had been brought-up earlier in the film. For those of you expecting for some sort of evangelical sermon about Jesus Christ to break out, you will be sorely disappointed. Very little of the debate in the movie centers around God, let alone Christianity. It really is more philosophical in looking at man's inhumanity towards man and why things in the world are obviously unfair. It is definitely thought provoking, almost exciting at times and will stimulate your mind long afterward, whatever your particular religious beliefs are (or aren't).

One correction to the ""official"" description given of the movie... There actually ARE some ""extras"" on the DVD, including a director commentary audio track and a behind the scenes short that runs about 20 minutes long. There are also some outtakes and other stuff from the cutting room floor that was left out due to time constraints. Also, there are the inevitable trailers for other movies the same studio has made. Probably worth watching, if you enjoyed the movie. I consider this film worth watching, although I was definitely hoping for more from it than it actually delivered though.",1355097600,,3478,4.85016835016835
3198397,3,B000WBCCFS,"It is a good movie to talk over with unbelievers. It is kind of slow to begin with but if you stick with it , it is worth it and is a good conversational starter.

3198398,5,B000WBCCFS,This message of the movie is deeper than many realize! We are so wrapped up in the day to day life of earning the dollar bill (the issue of capitalism) that we have forgotten what the purpose of life is. None of us is taking anything with us when we leave this world. The writer is brilliant in asking us to think about why we are here on earth. The mad man is actually quite right in the power of the military and the pharmacetical industy. We as human beings can spend our lives getting along with each other instead of killing each other. We haven't learned from the past because we keep repeating the same nonsense. We blow things apart and then rebuild. If we truly go forward as the message of the film and help each other what an incredible world it would be.,1338940800,5,766,4.2534246575342465
3198399,1,B000WBCCFS,"I will say one thing, the unintentional laughs I got from this movie did make it worthwhile. It's by no means a masterpiece by any stretch of the word and and that hammy acting and cliched line readings are clear evidence of that. No, this movie fails miserably because of one thing, there were no geniuses involved. A note to the producers, extremely high IQs like those shown in the movie aren't possible. The entire IQ test fails once you reach 200 and literally you can't go any higher but for the normal everyday Joe Sixpack it's more than adequate.

After the chess scene I knew this movie was a winner. It's a pretty poor example of a chess champion that gets caught in a fool's mate. But I guess that's because he wasn't a genius. After all, even novice players learn about that move and how to block it. That move is practically part of the learning process.

But no, we're faced with unconvincing characters, poor examples of geniuses and some of the worst questions ever devised. At best the questions and solutions sound like the ramblings of some conspiracy nut or somebody that doesn't know how most things in this world actually work. In the end, we're left with a jumbled mess that gets praise simply because it's a ""Christian"" movie. This movie failed when first shown, then the producers played up the Christian message and suddenly you're left with a movie that every Christian I've spoken to loves and praises the message.

I'm sorry, but this movie is simply not a good one. Take away the, admittedly very thin, message and you're left with something that should be regulated to the $1.00 bin at your local Wal*Mart.",1296950400,,1637,4.637931034482759

3198402,1,B000WBCCFS,"I find it ironic that the homeland security guy waxed eloquently on the dumbing down of our society to his doctor while his wife was dying of cancer.  This film is beyond dumbed down.  The dialogue is so cliched as to be a caricature of itself.  The acting is so abysmal that there isn't a believable character in the bunch.  The premise is just plain stupid.

I wanted to like this film.  I couldn't get past the first fifteen minutes.  My entire family concurred that we couldn't waste another minute of our lives, regardless of what the message of the film turned out to be.

Sorry, Cloud Ten, but after the Left Behind fiasco and this, perhaps film production isn't really your thing.  Take note of the work the Kendrick brothers are doing to see how to create a film that much more closely approximates a quality that you can be proud of.

Perhaps the film would go over with an immature crowd or young kids.  Though my fifteen year old daughter was the first to verbalize her dislike of the film.

The Genius Club is another sad example of poor Christian production values. We deserve better.",1272326400,5,1098,4.517766497461929
3198403,3,B000WBCCFS,"This movie has a lot of potential and seems very interesting, but I got really bored watching it. So frequently it was just an angry guy screaming at a bunch of people who were just arguing and wanting to leave and the asthmatic lady going into yet another asthma attack and falling on the floor while the economics professor has some random cigarette in his mouth (unlit). I think the script was awful, generic and, at times, cliche and uncomfortably sentimental. I think the group would have been a little different if they believed it with some more tension. I'd certainly imagine they'd get a little more focused and down to business than bicker the entire time, but it is a theoretical situation so... I'll give them a break.
The beginning could have been set up better as well as a better sense of real time throughout, especially toward the end when apparently they had only 2 minutes left yet definitely over 2 minutes of dialogue transpired. This is certainly no '24.'
What I do still like about this film is the premise and that the questions are thought-provoking, certainly more so than some of the latest trash out there--issues about politics, religion, business--basically everything NOT to bring up on a first date. While no issues really have good answers even outside of the scope of this film, there's not enough time within it to explore even one of the issues presented let alone all of them that were broached. There is a decent balance between viewpoints, I suppose. Decent enough, at least.
Overall, I recommend it as something to casually watch, or maybe for a Philosophy Club meeting.",1261699200,8,1610,4.774193548387097
