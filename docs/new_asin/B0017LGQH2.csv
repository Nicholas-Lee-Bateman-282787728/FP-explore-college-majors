8266377,1,B0017LGQH2,"I don't let my 3-year old daughter watch a lot of TV, so when she does get to watch a video, she's all over it like a drugged-out hyena.  This is the FIRST video that she has ever asked me to turn off.  She said, ""Mommy, I don't really like it.""  and started wringing her hands in distress.  Luckily, we checked this out from the library.  No one should ever buy this video, and only the courageous few should ever watch it.  It did make me laugh, and I even had to call my husband over to see it before I popped out the disk and put in something better.  If you've never seen pitiful animation superimposed on a blue screen narrated with the voice of a scary ice cream truck driver, maybe you should see if your local library has this.

The other reviewer does a great job of explaining what goes on in the video, so I won't elaborate.  Suffice it to say, it's bad.",1302825600,2,866,4.137724550898204
8266378,2,B0017LGQH2,"Once again, the Look and Learn series implies more than it delivers. Glad we checked these out at the library and didn't waste money on it.

This disc is entitled: Bear Friends - Learn to Read, which would lead reasonable people to think there might actually be some learning to read involved, but this would be incorrect. Essentially the show is carried on by a puppet who narrates two short stories, rather in the style of Reading Rainbow - the ""animation"" is merely a zooming in and out and basic manipulation of static illustrations. And for what it is, it's fine. If only the disc had been called: Bear Friends - listen to stories.

There is no text at all on screen during the stories. The puppet carries out a two-minute ""word game"" at the end of each story, in which a word is shown on screen with an illustration, and a brief verbal description to try to get the viewer to guess the word, which is then highlighted and repeated a couple of times. Each game introduces three words, for a grand total of six on the entire program. Six words, shown for a few seconds apiece, with no explanation of phonics or even the letters making them up, hardly qualifies as teaching reading. I don't think these even qualify as sight words, given a child's attention is going to be on the image and not the word in every case.

Two stars for entertaining my three-year-old reasonably well. Big fat LAME label for claiming to be something it isn't.",1276041600,2,1441,4.513409961685824
