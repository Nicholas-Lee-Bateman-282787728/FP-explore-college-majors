4719343,3,B005LAIGLO,"""Contraband"" presents a small conundrum. On the one hand, just about any new film released in the first few weeks of January is a film the studio has little or no confidence in. They are simply too busy concentrating their efforts on promoting their Award hopefuls. January is a dumping ground and they play films hoping to make some money and earn some promotion for the future DVD and download release. That's why the month is typically filled with horror films (""The Devil Inside"") and bad action films (""Underworld""). While ""Contraband"" would seem to fit this theory, it has a pretty respectable cast. Mark Wahlberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Ben Foster, Lukas Haas and J.K. Simmons populate this incredibly predictable action programmer. Ultimately, it isn't as bad as you might expect because the cast is much better than the material.

Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) and his wife, Kate (Kate Beckinsale in the first of her two films released in two weeks. Why does this woman keep working? See my reviews of ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Click"", and ""The Aviator"" for arguments against her further employment in Hollywood. If you need further evidence, watch ""Van Helsing"" and ""Whiteout"") are happily living in Algiers, a suburb of New Orleans. Chris, a former smuggler, now owns and runs a security company, installing alarm systems in people's homes. One night, Kate gets a call from her brother, Andy (Caleb Landry-Jones) who is in the hospital. He was smuggling drugs into the country when Customs boarded the freighter he was working on. He dumped the cargo and now Briggs (Ribisi) insists he is still owed a lot of money for the missing drugs. If Andy can't repay the money, Briggs will come after Chris, Kate and their kids. Chris decides to do one last run, to pay off the debt to Briggs, and gets his best friend, Sebastian (Ben Foster), also a former smuggler, to keep an eye on Kate and the kids. Chris arranges for Andy, Danny (Lukas Haas) and some other friends to serve as crewmembers on Captain Camp's (J.K. Simmons) freighter. Camp knows Chris and doesn't like him, so he keeps an eye on him. Next stop, Panama.

Naturally, the plan doesn't go as Chris envisioned and there are many complications. Will they be able to get their cargo? Will they be able to get it and return to the ship in time? Will they be able to hide it from Camp's prying eyes?

Directed by Baltazar Kormakur, who played Wahlberg's role in ""Reykjavic - Rotterdam"", the film ""Contraband"" is based on, the new film is a pleasant diversion, which exceeded my low expectations.

There is an economy to the narrative of ""Contraband"" that seems to insist we leave our disbelief among the puddles of sticky soda and popcorn on the movie theater floor. As the characters move about their business, we should be clicking our tongues and shouting at the screen ""Come on. That would never happen"". But the filmmakers simply keep moving the story forward. Their conceit seems to say, ""If we say it is so, then believe it."" And this is what most filmmakers do, they are creating the universe, they have the right. The success of the film depends on how well they make this work and how much we are willing to go along for the ride.

Fortunately, the caliber of actors helps us make this leap a little faster.

As soon as Chris finds out about his brother-in-law's situation, he goes to talk to Briggs, who he finds completely unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate; he wants the entire amount he is owed. There seems to be an unspoken code among the community; Briggs states Chris is responsible for Andy's debts and that seems to be law. This is one of those ""aw, come on"" moments. But I overlooked it and went along for the ride.

There is a brief throwaway moment when someone says to Chris, ""don't tell me you aren't enjoying this"". This statement helps establish why the reformed smuggler would go to such great lengths to help Andy. He is bored playing the respectable businessman and needs the thrill, the adrenaline to keep going.

Wahlberg is good, earnest and believable. He doesn't really have to try very hard because he has played this character, this role many times before.

Giovanni Ribisi plays Briggs, a low-life criminal who lives in the Projects with his young daughter. Initially, his accent seems more than a little strange, but then you realize he is supposed to be Cajun and has adopted their dialect. What doesn't quite work is the speech pattern. He has the accent but he doesn't speak like the person he is supposed to be. Read a James Lee Burke book, watch ""The Big Easy"", visit New Orleans. Simply using the accent adds a layer of corniness to a performance that is already hammy and difficult to watch.

Sebastian, Chris' best friend and confidant, is a subdued role for Ben Foster. Maybe he and Ribisi played Rock, Paper, Scissors to see who would play Briggs. Either could. Both have played similar characters in the past. Ribisi apparently lost. The most interesting thing about Sebastian is that he and Chris used to work as a team, smuggling things together. For this last job, Chris asks him to stay behind and watch Kate and the kids. Later, as his character deals with some complications, Foster maintains the character's slow burn persona. He looks like he could blow up at any moment and when he doesn't, Sebastian becomes more interesting.

J.K. Simmons' Captain Camp enters the narrative late but he still manages to create one of the more interesting characters in the film. Camp has experience with Chris and because of this doesn't trust him and keeps a wary eye on the younger man. He also has an abnormal penchant for cleanliness, which is worked into the overall story in a unique and interesting way.

Kate Beckinsale. If you are a devoted reader of my reviews you know I am not a fan. To say the least. Thankfully, she is not in a lot of the film. Wahlberg's character travels to Panama, taking the focus away from her. Then, a plot development ensures she has an even smaller impact on the story. Because of her limited screen time, she isn't terrible.

When Chris begins to put his plan in motion, you quickly realize the plan will follow a pretty standard Hollywood rule that will dictate much of the narrative flow. Because of this, you know how the plan will unfold and the film becomes much less suspenseful.

This problem, and an extremely predictable plot twist, cause ""Contraband"" to falter. But it doesn't falter as much as you might expect.

Good for a bargain matinee or rental.",1327536000,2,6496,4.726148409893993
4719344,3,B005LAIGLO,"You used to be a smuggler, but you went straight.  Now you live in New Orleans, you're married with kids, and you run your own business.  You even supported your best friend's stint in AA.  And then one day, your little brother-in-law tries to copy your act, blows a drug-smuggling run, and ends up seriously in hock to a seriously bad man (Giovani Ribisi)...

2012's gritty thriller ""Contraband"" stars Mark Wahlberg as the reformed smuggler, who must make one more good run to save the life of his brother-in-law.  He puts together a team and a plan to smuggle counterfeit US currency back from Panama on a container ship. His best buddy (Ben Foster) will watch over his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and the kids.

No plan survives first contact with reality, and this one starts to go wrong in Panama, with Wahlberg and his team racing the clock and a gang of thugs to get back to the ship, with the counterfeit currency, before it sails.  But that won't be the end of the bad news.  Wahlberg faces a betrayal on board the ship, and one or two more back on shore in New Orleans.

""Contraband"" has a mission impossible-like conclusion, with lots of action and suspense along the way.  It's hard not to root for Wahlberg and his crew in what ends up being an entertaining movie; recommended.",1326758400,,1285,4.572052401746725
4719345,3,B005LAIGLO,"Not an award winner, but this movie was ok and I enjoyed it.  As another reviewer said, ""Forgettable [movie] but fun while it lasted.""  It is about smuggling/running drugs and counterfeit money.

Scene 1 of this adventure begins in the harbor.  As a cargo ship is coming in, the police and Customs are swarming around in choppers.  Young Andy dumps 10 bricks of coke before the Customs agents board the ship.

Scene 2 switches over to a wedding reception, where we meet Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Kate (Kate Beckensale).  Farraday used to be a runner himself, but he got out of it and became legitimate.  Chris started his own business, Farraday Security Systems.

When the bad guys show up at the harbor for their package, young Andy tells them he had to dump it.  It's a no-brainer that the bad guys bust Andy up, primarily a guy named Briggs.  Andy calls his sister, Kate Farraday, from the hospital.  Since Chris still has ties to the bad guy network, he meets up with Briggs and tries to talk.  But Briggs just wants his money, and tells Chris that the debt belongs to Andy AND his whole family.

In order to make some big money quickly and protect his wife and children, and to try to help Andy, Chris gets temporarily back into the business, traveling to Panama and back to New Orleans.  As you might expect, things are not as easy as Chris thought they would be.

The movie held my interest the entire time.  It was interesting and had a decent amount of action.  Wahlberg was in the typical type role I see him in -- tough guy/protect what's mine/get even.  Beckensale's role was blah.  (Not her fault, the character had little to do except scream.) It is probably a movie I would watch only once.",1326672000,3,1723,4.514563106796117
4719346,3,B005LAIGLO,"Glum Mark Wahlberg sleepwalks through this role as he has in most of his other movies.  He is a retired smuggler of counterfeit money and other contraband (he don't do drugs!)  Now with a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and a couple of young children, he has his own security installation business.  When his brother-in-law gets in trouble with a mobster (a very effective and slimy Giovanni Ribisi) for losing a cocaine heist, Chris (Wahlberg) agrees to another run, coming out of retirement.  Surprisingly, all his enablers and companions are still in place from New Orleans to Panama.  This is one of those heist movies we've seen dozens of times.  You find yourself pulling for the success of the crime even knowing...well, it's a crime.  But of course, there is a noble cause.

As in typical heist films, the plans are terribly complicated and convoluted, yet are created on short notice.  Also every detail must be pulled off without a hitch.  Timing must be perfect.  Yada, yada, yada.  Here's the kicker.  I got caught up in the intricacy and action sequences.  There are explosions and gunfights of course, but they don't overwhelm the film ala, Michael Bay.  If you are worn out from all of the award-worth films of November, December and early January, let this showy film cleanse your movie-watching palate.  You won't remember it in a few months but it's fun while it lasts.",1326672000,30,1388,4.842553191489362
4719347,3,B005LAIGLO,"Well, Mark Wahlberg is up to his neck in another daring heist, except that CONTRABAND comes off as a poor cousin to THE ITALIAN JOB. What's a shame is that Wahlberg gets support from a roster of high profile Hollywood names, and so you'd think the script would've done this casting coup a service. Instead, we're treated - or maybe ""played with"" is a better word - to a routine caper. On doldrum days when the box office is slow, I might recommend CONTRABAND. But, right now, with an assembly of top notch feature films currently holding court? No, skip this 'til the DVD comes out.

Breaking down the plot: Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) nowadays runs his own security system service, and he's content. But not so long ago, Chris used to run something entirely contrary to his current enterprise. In New Orleans, back in the day, Chris Farraday was a world class smuggler, bold and inventive. Today, he has a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and two young sons, and so he's walking the straight and narrow. But you know that old saw about just when you think you're out...

When Chris's screw-up brother-in-law Andy fouls up a drug run and cheeses off the local crime boss (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris must step back into his old life to settle Andy's debt. At this stage of the story, if you anticipate CONTRABAND as a relentless action-thriller, you'd not be right. A huge chunk of Chris's master plan is to board a freight ship and use it to ferry his loot. That he runs up against the ship's suspicious Captain Camp (J.K.Simmons at his growly best) and manages to tweak him in the nose is just a bonus. On the freighter he meets the rest of his smuggling crew, and it's too bad the script fails to give them much to do. As it is, they don't really register on my radar, except for that one really cautious guy. The film shifts back and forth between Chris' onboard machinations and how his wife, Kate, and his kids are faring back home (they're not faring real well, considering they are continually menaced by Ribisi). Chris's best friend, Sebastian (Ben Foster) is tasked with protecting Chris's family. But since when has Ben Foster ever played a reliably straight-forward character? Well, maybe this time. The first half of the film plods along.

The action finally heats up when the freighter arrives at its destination of Panama. Chris and Andy (and their cautious colleague) disembark and here is where I question the timeline. Confined to less than an hour to conduct his business, Chris manages to inadvertently tick off Panama City's current underworld kingpin, get involved in an armored truck heist, evade the policia, and sneak himself and his contraband onboard the freighter just as it's sailing away. This all seems a little too busy for me, but he's not called the ""Houdini of smuggling"" for nothing. Somewhere, Phileas Fogg has scheduled a few minutes in which to be impressed.

This is a remake of the Icelandic 2009 thriller Reykjavk-Rotterdam which starred Baltasar Kormkur, a guy who's switched hats because he ended up directing CONTRABAND. Based on his helm work here, I'm not so enthused to check out the original film. The best thing about CONTRABAND is Ben Foster, which is not at all surprising, seeing as Foster is usually the best thing in whatever film he's in. It's fun to see him gradually melt down. On the other hand, a shockingly blonde Kate Beckinsale takes on a thankless role. Giovanni Ribisi, usually a fine actor, adopts this absolutely grating voice (think a whinier Marlon Brando). Every time he spoke, my hand twitched reflexively to slap him upside the head. But this isn't an awful movie. It has merits. I get a kick out of how a Jackson Pollock painting was dismissed and discarded as tarpaulin. From the Panama City sequence on, I was invested. I'll say this for Mark Wahlberg, he's at his best when he's simmering with righteous fury. You don't want this cat to tell you that he's coming for you. And when he's not thrashing the ef out of them hooligans, he's outwitting them silly. Without dropping any details, I'll mention that his ploy to ultimately confound Ribisi and his henchmen is pretty damn inspired. So, yes, there are watchable elements in this  slow burn action thriller. But I'm still holding out for the ITALIAN JOB sequel.",1326585600,2,4284,4.752688172043011

4719400,3,B005LAIGLO,"Contraband
 I found Contraband to be a well done if conventional heist movie with few surprises.  Mark Walberg continues his career arc from fashion model to rap singer to movie actor to full blown movie star.  He has the lead as a former world class smuggler who is drawn back for one more gig after a family member gets into trouble with the wrong people.  The film is set in New Orleans, so when just about everyone in the film is a crook of one kind or another, we are not surprised.  Walberg is a believable action hero.  When he smacks a bad guy, we really think that he has the goods to do the job.  He is aided and abetted by Kate Beckinsale as his wife.  She is in a decidedly supporting role with little to do save for regular expressions of fear, alarm or concern.  We note once again that plum roles for women are few and far between.  She will be back soon in her accustomed staring vehicle about the eons long struggle between vampires and werewolves. In skin tight latex.  We are so shallow.
 Ben Foster has the best role from an actors point of view.  He plays the best friend of the leading character who sells him out.  Foster does heartless psychopath as well as or better than anyone on screen today.  His character has the only traditional emotional journey, in this case from friend to murderer.
 Both the director and the writer are new to the big leagues.  The producers trusted them with $25 million of their own money to make the film, bravely.  They will be rewarded for their trust in the new comers.  Director Baltasar Kromakur brings his hand held camera right into the action, an immediacy that some do not appreciate but I found effective.  The convoluted script by Aaron Gazikowski keeps us guessing, at least most of the time.  His best effort, or most clever effort, is a subtle attack on modern art which is inserted as a kind of minor subtext in the story.  Art is what those smarter-or at least richer-than we are tell us is art, or a paint tarp, whichever.
 This film cannot compare to the recent heist movie The Town, but it still is a diverting way to spend an hour and 50 minutes.  In three days the R rated film brought in a solid $24 million.  This was enough to put Contraband at the top of the box office for this weekend.  I think people wanted to see some bad guys come to grief after the year end films of a more serious nature.  I know I did.
 Two and a half saw blades make this movie neither great nor terrible.  It is right in the mathematic middle.  It is average.  Average, with at least one memorable performance by Ben Foster is not bad for the first week in January.  I love the movies.",1470268800,,2644,4.33265306122449

4720003,1,B005LAIGLO,"I wanted to like this movie.  I really wanted to like it.  I love these two actors and they are talented.  I have no idea why they signed on for this film.  Even they couldn't save it.

It finally gets good in the last 40 minutes, if one can stay with it that long.

It starts with tough-guy action, right off the bat.  But there is no character development, so we don't care about these people until close to the end.

The dialogue tries to be macho and tough, but it just comes out silly.

Who can take criminals seriously when their disguise is to duct tape their faces?  I mean, really?  And it wasn't meant as a joke, either.  It was serious in the plot.

Now, this next part probably won't interest anyone who is not from Panama, unless you are interested in things being more accurate.  I am from Panama and this embarrasses me.  It was distracting in the biggest way.

They got city names wrong in Panama, in pronunciation.  Does everyone not know that double ll's in Spanish is usually pronounced as a ""y?""  All they had to do was google the names and viola, there is the proper pronunciation.

Mark is wearing a leather jacket outside in Panama the whole time.  Really?

Accents were screwed up.  Mexican accents are not anywhere near Panamanian accents.  They are two different countries very far apart in geography.  It would be like casting someone with a heavy French accent who says they are from Kansas.

Pilots do not take ships through the canal.  Only canal pilots do that.  They board the ship and take it through.  If they hit the side, like in this movie, the ship would be there for a very long time.

I could have overlooked how bad this movie is, if they had gotten the rest right.... maybe.

It's just so bad.",1402790400,,1735,4.39873417721519

4720350,4,B005LAIGLO,"""Contraband"" follows the story of a former world-class smuggler Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg), now a father of two children and happily married to Kate (Kate Beckinsale). When his brother-in-law failed to deliver the goods to a sadistic drug dealer Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris is forced to do one last job: smuggling counterfeit $100 bills from Panama.

The action thriller looks a bit like a throwback to an old-fashioned heist movie, though ""Contraband"" is actually a remake of 2008 Icelandic film ""Reykjavk-Rotterdam"" starring Baltasar Kormkur, who now directs the new version. The by-the-numbers story of ""Contraband"" is filled with stock characters played by typecast actors, but the film is fast-paced and its action sequences are decent.

For all its familiarity, ""Contraband"" is an entertaining action movie that benefits from slick direction, high production value and effective acting.",1372377600,,900,5.610294117647059

4720400,3,B005LAIGLO,Baltasar Kormakur remakes his heist film ` Reykjavik-Rotterdam' as Contraband with Wahlberg in as the main lead.  In Contraband he is a reformed criminal who will do a final heist because his wife's brother is in trouble. Contraband is the typical January film that does not pretend and is a predictable twist driven film that promises some fun but nothing spectacular. A great cast NOT including Beckinsale ( who is actually responsible for the plot happenings) is wasted because of mundane sequences and all sparks but no fire in the script. People are tired of such movie but then there are many takers as well....3 stars. 4/25/2013,1368144000,,635,4.934579439252336

4720563,4,B005LAIGLO,"Mark Wahlberg is certainly no genius, but when it comes to action movies, he's on top of his game. I wish I could say Contraband was an amazing film, but it was your typical, shoot 'em up action thriller, although the plot was better than most. A lot of critics bashed this film because of its predictability, but what do you expect from these types of films? The story, about an ex-smuggler, returning to his old ways to pay off an unexpected debt, was easy to follow and full of cool action sequences. That's really all you can ask for from these films and I rather enjoyed it. If you don't like action movies, don't watch them! If you do like them, Contraband is a pretty good one and few action stars bring to the table the experience that Whalberg has. If you're looking for something that you don't really have to think about, that will hold your attention, and kill a couple of hours, go with Contraband.",1361491200,,911,4.428571428571429

4720637,2,B005LAIGLO,"My foolish baboon of a bride Bessie has always had a thing for Marky Mark.  He's usually pretty good when he's not singing and he's decent in this movie as he does a good job as the duped reformed criminal gone good gone bad gone good to support the Mask lookalike baby brother of the stupidly blonde (and everhot) Kate Beckinsale.  Boom boom boom, but no matter.  The movie is too darn long, too unbelievable, and there is nowhere near enough Kate to make up for the 107 minutes of stupidity and boredom.

The good guy is a bit bad but ultimately wants to do the right thing for his family - wants some kind of redemption.

This story is filled with counterfeit money, art smuggling, drug trafficking and interesting relationships that make for a great story.  Giovanni Ribisi does a great job of playing the wacked out gangster type.  Marky Mark plays a character who has tried to go clean but needs to do some more ""business"" to raise money to solve a family issue.  He moves back into what he already knows ... smuggling and counterfeiting.

I love his I'm bad (in the best way) and I know it, don't mess with my family or else, old-school character and portrayal.  Shout out to Mr. Wahlberg and the writers.  3.

If you've ever, ever chosen to do something because you were trying to save someone you love from reaping the negative consequences of their dumber than dumb decision, or if you've ever seen someone else you know who's done it, you'll get this film.  5.  I love loyalty.  And family loyalty is a beautiful thing -- sometimes had to live with, but at it's core -- beautiful.  ALL these things and more are in the film.  All the actors rock.

4720970,5,B005LAIGLO,"Contraband is truly a different kind of action flick. It starts off with two young men bringing in drugs. They have to dump the shipment because the border patrol invades the ship. They have to answer to goons, who in turn tries to kill them soon after. One of the boys dies, but one lives. Mark Wahlberg's character, Chris, is pulled in to help his young brother in law pay off the debt he owes to the drug dealers. Of course, the movie starts moving at a faster pace, eventually moving to Panama, where there is off the seat action. The Panama portion is the meat of the film, and it was fun to watch.

I loved this movie. I have never seen anything like it. It is the kind of the movie that you can't walk away from because there is a lot going on, and it's all connected in one way or another. It is a well crafted storyline and all of the actors did a great job.

I know there is a lot of reviewers that don't like it. It's not a complete shoot 'em up, car chase at every scene, bombings at every turn kind of movie. It is what I call a smart action film. Things happen you don't expect, and I really liked the refreshing change to the action genre.

Andy's boss, ruthless mobster Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), is infuriated and demands repayment.
The plot was good and the acting wasn't bad but there were too many slow parts for an action/thriller, although it does get more intense towards the end. They went to the extreme with language just to get an R rating, if they reduced the language a bit than it could easily be PG-13.

4721137,3,B005LAIGLO,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

This film has an excellent premise and good acting from everyone, particularly Mark Wahlberg & a sorely underused Kate Beckinsale. An excellent premise and good acting are two key ingredients for a great steak, movie-wise. However, this one is undercooked in the relationship area between Kate and her little brother. I never got the impression that she loved him, apart from one line early in the film. And why do writers feel that it's okay to combine God's Name with a mild curse word, thereby turning it into a strong profanity? That's also another reason I gave this film 3 stars instead of 5.

Rated R (strong language & violence and brief drug use).",1347580800,,704,4.715447154471545
4721138,3,B005LAIGLO,"Chris Farraday (Mark Walhberg) thought he'd left his smuggling days behind him, but when his kid brother-in-law screws up a smuggling gig for a drug dealer (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris realizes he has to head back into the world he knows so well to save his wife's (Kate Beckinsale) drowning brother, but it's not all as simple as it seems.

`Contraband' doesn't disappoint while it lasts, but it's also forgettable after the credits roll and probably serves better as a rental for a night-in. Director Baltasar Kormakur knows how to keep up the tension throughout the film and throwing twist after unexpected twist at us while getting Chris and his crew deeper under water until, mid-way through, they're so in the crap you'll wonder how the heck they'll get themselves out - which felt a lot more like out of bad guy slip-ups and luck by the way -  right down to the double-crossings and shock discoveries. The action, while hardly `an action junkie's playground' (LA Times), is kept very grounded and real and is in keeping with the grittier edge of the film, and it works, I didn't find anything here that was over-the-top or ridiculous.

I didn't watch commentary track but I did sit through `Reality Factor: The Stunts and Action of Contraband', basically a short documentary about how Kormakur wanted to keep the action and stunts real and a walk-through on shooting some of the action scenes in the movie, mildly interesting, but also pretty unremarkable stuff.",1347321600,,1465,4.875502008032129

Things seem just peachy but of course this wouldn't make for much of a movie unless a ruthless drug lord (Giovanni Ribisi, ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"") decides to threaten Chris's and more importantly his family's well being.

This forces Chris to revert to his old ways to protect those that he loves, so the movie does become one chase scene after another as Chris is determined to take everyone down. Its somewhat similar to ""Shooter"" in that this flick is nothing more than a vehicle for Wahlberg who does well in most every movie he's in, even with the limted material films like this provides.

At least its fun to watch at times, cause the story and dialogue are pretty standard as are most of the performances. Having Walhberg in this really does elevate this basic action flick, as its pretty bare bones beyond the action.

The movie had many twists and turns.  Wahlbergs character (Chris Farraday) simply did not want to get pulled back into a life of crime again, but at each turn you can feel him get pulled deeper and deeper into it.

Acting may not have been the best, but this movie definitely keeps you interested until the end. Its not really a full on action movie. It is a part action part suspense movie. The combination works throughout.

There are a few points that seem to give rise to brilliance, but most of those are quickly tossed under the rug by standard cliches of drug, police and action movies.

This time he has to save his brother, who's gotten into trouble because he blew a smuggling job.  Now Wahlberg has to take on a larger smuggling job, which he swore he would never do again, to save his brother.

Wait, does that sound familiar?  It's pretty much the story of Gone in 60 Seconds, but with a better lead actor and part of the story is set in South America.  (It even has Giovanni Ribisi!!)

The reason I don't rate this movie higher is that the plot is lacking a little bit and there is an extraordinary amount of gruesome violence.  Don't get me wrong, I love action movies but there are a few times that I had to look away!

I'm not over saturated by the genre so I enjoy most of the ones I see. ""Contraband"" is now on my list of films I'd recommend.

The Blu-ray release of ""Contraband"" will satisfy movie lovers with the amount of special features and a quality feature that will entertain viewers. There's a lot of pervasive language, a good amount of violence, and some drug use in this. However, it's no more than what fans of these types of crime thrillers are already used to.",1338768000,,613,4.473214285714286

4721589,5,B005LAIGLO,The movie Contraband was very good and well written; many twists in the plot.  Mark Wahlberg was excellent as usual and Kate Beckinsale is hot.  Basic plot: Chris Farraday's (Wahlberg) wife and brother-in-law are threatened by a crime organization; Farraday goes into action in a very unique way to eliminate the problem at the source. I'd give this movie an 8 on a 10 scale.,1338508800,,375,4.753846153846154

4721591,1,B005LAIGLO,I lost interest in the movie in first half hour.  No interest in seeing it through due to being so slow and boring.  There was no belief in the characters or any real interest in the story.  Not even worth spending my time writing a full review.  Better things to do with my time than watch this movie.,1338422400,2,302,4.155172413793103
4721632,3,B005LAIGLO,"In this plot-by-numbers thriller, Mark Wahlberg plays an ex-smuggler who is trying to get his life back on track with a legit alarm installation business. His cozy suburban life is thrown for a loop when his brother-in-law, following in his tracks, is forced to dump a package of CONTRABAND by a surprise border inspection. Now the brother-in-law is in it bad (to the tune of 700Gs) with the roughnecks who were expecting the package. Led by a scraggly and amoral Giovanni Ribisi, these unscrupulous no-good-niks get Wahlberg involved when they threaten to punish him and his family for his bro-in-law's major muck-up. Gosh darn it, now Wahlberg is pulled back into the world he's tried so hard to escape from, forced to pull one last job to keep his wife and kids out of the paws of these vicious thugs.

I can ignore how derivative the plot is. This is an old, old, old story (ex-con is forced back in the biz by thugs who threaten his new life and livelihood), and the addition of a giant boat, huge pallets of ""funny money,"" and a plot twist you can see coming from fifty minutes away do nothing to add a creative spin to the tale. It's so formulaic, in fact, that I promptly forgot every character's name when the movie was over.

Wahlberg is one of the few bankable stars left that hasn't completely alienated his fan base. His pretensions aren't very high, which helps, and he is smart enough to stick with what he's good at: being tough, sharp with a word, and cutting an imposing figure. It's fun to watch him, and even though his character here is as flat as a slice of processed cheese, he doesn't seem to be boring himself, and so the audience has a chance to avoid the same fate. Ribisi, too, gleefully chews the scenery as the movie's token Bad Guy Without Limits, and although his character behaves in ways that would normally get him arrested in seconds, his overall implausibility is dismissed by the sheer volume with which he plays the bad guy.

There's action here, too, although it's equally implausible. Smuggling, it seems, is all about timing and foresight, and although Wahlberg's bunch gets thrown more than a few curve balls, they all seem to have the keenest sense of timing. Count how many times someone avoids detection or discovery by a literal hair's-breadth, and you'll probably hit double digits before the film's half-way mark. This long train of consistently close calls ends up having the opposite effect, deflating whatever tension the story might have built up. ""Let me guess,"" I said to my friend. ""In this scene, one of the smugglers accomplishes his task with half of a second to spare.""

If you're older than thirteen, you've probably seen this movie before. You can guess who will win, how they will, and even what ""surprises"" the movie might have up its sleeve. It's like Mad Libs for movies, these kinds of plots. In this case, it's all done with workable skill and there's nothing glaringly awful about the film. It's just not very impressive or unique, either. It's shrug-worthy, in other words.",1338422400,,3043,4.703564727954972

Although the general plot line isn't original, there were some interesting subplots and twists throughout. The main characters are fleshed out and realistic, not cardboard cutouts of your friendly neighborhood racketeering ring. The dialogue was succinct and there were some funny moments too.

Kate Beckensale does a great job as well and despite her affinity for using the F-word (which sounds so sweet coming from her british lips) is adorable in this movie.

4721721,1,B005LAIGLO,"Movies like this are ugly and not entertaining. In the 1940s, noir movies had a manner to separate the good/bad guys from the bad/bad guys, and keep us from leaving. For example, in 1947s Kiss of Death, Victor Mature is a crook who eventually goes good, while Richard Widmark, as the notorious Tommy Udo, was not only bad, but probably created a role that dogged him his entire career. (Just check out how Tommy Udo deals with ""Rat fink"" grandmothers in wheelchairs.) In Contraband, a vile drama, much like The Departed, Man on Fire, and 52 Pickup, we must endure enormous cruelty and gratuitous violence merely for the sake of a self-indulgent director and badly written script. The stories are not made more clear, the characters more understandable, the dramatic resolution at least satisfying. Instead, Thank God, that's over!

It's a ridiculous movie that, unlike Gone in 60, doesn't know when to have fun with itself but is unwilling to actually commit to being a more realistic movie either. What you get is Mark Walburg being the typical tough guy he loves to play in a movie so gutlessly predictable that you'll actually find yourself wishing you were watching Nicholas Cage or even Jason Statham instead. Towards the end of the movie they have a very real chance to get some emotion out of Walburg's character from the audience, even if the circumstances that lead there are frankly comedic, instead they turn what could have been a very real tragedy into a miracle the defies modern science.",1337126400,,790,4.65

Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is a retired smuggler gone straight as he is happily married and has two children.  Andy is his brother-in-law and now Chris has to go back into the smuggling business to help Andy pay the drug debt he owes before he gets killed....

What follows is a convoluted and multi-tiered plot that is so predictable that you can even guess where the drugs are hidden 70 minutes before it happens.  The storyline basically gives away many of the movies key elements long before they occur and if you listen closely to the dialog you can figure out where the plot is headed before you get there.  I like to be surprised and this movie's events were easily foreseeable.

The acting seems just award at times and this combined with the storyline make this just an average movie.  Overall it is a 3 or maybe a little better but I wanted Mark Wahlberg to shine in this movie as I think he is a good actor.  The movie and Mark never really achieve their top performance that should have been possible to carry this movie to a higher quality.

If you like Mark, watch the movie but don't expect one of his best performances.  I think the script was just too limiting for him (or the Director)!",1336608000,,1462,4.357933579335794

And of course one of his best friends has set him up. As always, Giovanni Robisi is awesome, however even he can't really save the film.

Any C-rated actress could have filled this role (e.g. Lindsey Lohan stoned).  As they say, Kate couldn't resist a payday for 6 days of work, so she took the money and ran.  Even the bad guys in this film are pathetic, non-menacing.

Mark has to stop thinking he's a great producer, actor, and judge of scripts, and fire his agent & manager, and return to being a simpleton sidekick of real A-list actors (e.g. George Clooney in Three Kings).

4721854,2,B005LAIGLO,"2 stars. The amazon crowd has got it right. This is clearly a hastily made money flick. I was surprised to read about great acting and ""gritty"" feel. There is no grit whatsoever in Contraband. In fact I abandoned the movie about 15 min before the end, exactly because there was no engagement or grit. There are few things which are working against calling this a good movie:

1. Boring dialogs. I guess nobody read the script or what? 50% of all dialogs are different characters asking Wahlberg how he is going to pull off his smuggling. He always responds something like ""have faith in me"". The other 50% is Wahlberg invariably asking for more time when on the phone with his accomplices.

2. No attention to details. This is the primary reason why this movie has zero grit. They are pulling their stunts in hot and humid Panama City. Yet nobody is even break a sweat.

Overall, instead of spending money on relatively expensive aerial shots, producers would have been better off spending on better script and actually waking up Mark Wahlberg. Because Mark looks very stiff in this movie. This is a borderline flick which could have gone straight to DVD release bypassing big screen.",1336348800,5,1184,4.7101449275362315
4721855,2,B005LAIGLO,"I've certainly enjoyed some of the amazing films that Mark Wahlberg has done over the past few years. Also, Kate Beckinsale shows us once again that she is not just a pretty face, but is a really talented actress. Overall, the acting in this movie is pretty good. The cast is a strong ensemble of some very talented people. Walhberg and Beckinsale's talent shows through, while others, who I know to be good actors struggled.
  I'm not a picky movie person unless I want to be. That is, when I don't like something, I begin to notice every fault it has. To be clear I love action movies with not a lot of plot and great action sequences. Put together a decent plot and blow some things up and I'll be one happy moviegoer. This movie couldn't even manage that. The Direction was downright awful. The really talented actors were able to make you believe their characters dispite this, but others, who I have really enjoyed watching in other things just couldn't pull it off. This is not surprising considering how truly awful the script was. I felt like there was half the story missing, most movies of this genre start with ""the last job"" before ""retirement,"" then move onto how the protagonist gets dragged into one last job to save their family, friends etc. This movie dumps you halfway into a plot with the characters giving lame, forced explanations of ""the past life.""
  I don't mind a predictable plot, I don't mind a plot with twists and turns. This movie managed to have twists I didn't expect, but was more confused by then surprised. It was predictable in places, but it all seemed too convenient. Instead of those tense moments where you don't know how the characters are going to get out of it, but somehow they do, those moments are skipped altogether, and they are explained later on like a great problem was solved, even though you didn't know there was one.
  Since I'm being a movie snob, the cinematography was sub par and the editing was not much better then I could do with my Mac Book Pro and iMovie. The movie had a strange coloring too it, that I just didn't see any reason for. Yes, I know you can color-balance the movie to look ""gritty"" but at least have a good reason for it.
  My movie standards aren't that high (as I said, when I don't like something, I'll see every problem). I love the Die-Hard tetralogy (which are excellent), movies like ""Shooter"" (which is totally underrated) ""The transporter"" and even ""The Day After Tomorrow."" This movie couldn't even meet my pretty low standards for an action films. Don't waste your time and money on this snorer.",1336348800,2,2587,4.584415584415584

4721857,1,B005LAIGLO,"The movie itself is (arguably) fine; the main problem with this product is the blu ray formatting itself.

Similarly, if you eject the movie, re-insert, and try to select the scene you were watching, it freezes on that scene and will not play.

I fail to see how the Blu-Ray industry can keep shoving the ""Blu Ray is so awesome"" speech down our throats, when I have YET to see a single blu ray that will play from start to finish without pausing for several seconds at some point in the middle of the movie to ""catch up with itself"". DVD never did that. And DVD on a blu ray player looks great! All the industry needed to do was make a better dvd player, not an inferior new movie format.

4721917,2,B005LAIGLO,"Right out of the gate you will notice the goofy camera work. You are not supposed to notice the camera work in a movie, its just supposed to flow. This had to be this camera crews first movie. Weird angles, obnoxious close ups, fuzzy lens filters (by the way, don't pay for the HD version, its blurry anyways due to camera effects) jerky camera movements and zooms.

Second, I noticed the language. I know its rated R and expected it to be an R rated movie, but they forced the ""f"" word into sentences it wouldn't naturally be in or even make sense in and got old very fast. I think producers do this as a way to make sure the movie is rated R and not pg-13 b/c R sells better. Fine, but they did a horrible job of it and was just embarrassing to listen to.

Third, the plot is basically a rehash of every other heist movie. I don't expect every movie to be original when Hollywood cranks out so many movies a year, most movies are plain remakes anyways, but this is a total ripoff. If you think you want to watch this movie, simply watch ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (even has one of the same actors) and ""Italian Job"" back to back, add some goofy plot twist and then you have ""Contraband"" This movie does not have the quality of either of those but rather just the ripped off plot. It also takes two thirds of the movie for any of the action to start even start.

The only reason i gave it two stars instead of one was because of a twist a short time before the end which saved the movie. It made my feel better about wasting the money, however, still a waste. I'll be honest though, I almost didn't make it that far. The beginning of the movie sucked so bad that I almost shut it off regardless of the money I spent just to play Call of Duty, which by the way HAS A BETTER PLOT THAN THIS MOVIE.",1335744000,3,1789,4.1203438395415475

Wahlberg is his usual frowny, muscley self, not much change here- but this is how I like my Wahlberg, full of quiet angst and muted emotions (sans rage of course).

4722063,3,B005LAIGLO,"Perhaps confusing changing plans are part of the heist crimes - who would know - but when those rapid sequences changes in plans and personnel are transferred to a film that is supposed to make sense it rarely works. Perhaps this flimsy film made sense in the original film from Iceland called `Reykjav&iacute;k Rotterdam' which starred the director of this film, Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, in the main role, but Aaron Guzikowski's adaptation of that film written by Arnaldur Indriason and &Oacute;skar J&oacute;nasson leaves so many holes and covers information with fast talking and loud visual and audio effects that the audience is pretty much let to its own concludions about whether or not to care about anyone or any thing in CONTRABAND. As the main character Chris Farrady (Mark Wahlberg) states `I've got to try and fix this. Trust me, I know what I'm doing.'  Well, that didn't work....

As the condensed plot summary goes, `Chris Faraday (Wahlberg) once smuggled illegal items or contraband into the country on freighters. He left that life behind, got married has a wife (Kate Bekinsale) family and went legit. But when his brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) got involved with Briggs (a tattooed and smarmy Giovanni Ribisi), a drug dealer and when he blew a deal, Briggs demands restitution which he can't deliver. So Chris offers to find a way to pay him but the he threatens Chris' family if he doesn't deliver. So he gets on a freighter destined for Panama with his friend Danny (Lukas Haas) and he sets out to bring back some counterfeit currency. Briggs ""goes to see"" Chris' family. When Chris learns of this he asks his friend Sebastian (Ben Foster) to take care of them - big mistake.... He tells Chris that it would be better to bring drugs instead of the cash. The captain of the freighter (J.K. Simmons) is on the take and the strange weirdo dealer in Panama is Gonzalo (Diego Luna). Every other minute plans change and the bulk of the film is devoted to hide and seek and violence.

With all the writers and scripts available it I always amazing how such fine actors as Kate Bekinsale, Ben Foster, Giovanni Ribisi, JK Simmons, Diego Luna and Mark Wahlberg can sign on to be a part of a film such as this.  Completely forgettable movie despite some very fine actors. Maybe the Icelandic version was better. Grady Harp, April 12",1335312000,,2354,4.8049382716049385

4722070,3,B005LAIGLO,"""Contraband"" is a 2011 action film starring Mark Wahlberg as a former smuggler reluctantly drawn back into the game for one last score, this time to help his brother-in-law (Caleb Landry Jones) who got in too deep with the bad guys (Giovanni Ribisi).

For the past few years Wahlberg has been cranking out the action films at a pace that truly amazes. He's been nominated twice for an Oscar (""The Fighter"" in 2010 and ""The Departed"" in 2006) and recognized for ""Three Kings"" (1999), and ""Four Brothers"" (2005), although my favorite Wahlberg role (and guilty pleasure) ""Shooter"" (2007) has been ignored on the awards circuit.

If his awards were not sufficient praise, Wahlberg has delivered at the box office. Seven of his films have neared or topped the elusive $100 Million mark, and most of his films have been among the top 10.

And if awards and box office clout aren't enough, Wahlberg has a second career as a producer, a role he served on this film and on Oscar nominated ""The Fighter"" (2010) as well as several TV series (""Broadwalk Empire"", ""Entourage"").

Unfortunately, Wahlberg is about the best thing in this film, apart from some good action scenes with lots of explosions and a coy performance from J. K. Simmons who apparently got time off from his role as the Police Chief in ""The Closer"".

Perhaps the problem is with the writers (Aaron Guzikowski, Arnaldur Indrioason, Oskar Jonasson) and director (Baltasar Kormakur), none of whom have much experience with American style action films. But they worked on an Icelandic thriller ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" (2008) and that film was the basis of this one. Or, more likely, the problem is that the villain, Giovanni Ribisi, simply carries no menace. Ribisi is a very talented actor (""Boiler Room"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Rum Diary""), but he's out of his depth in this genre.

Reviews were unanimously poor. Roger Ebert referred to the film as ""crap"" and said he was getting tired of violent retreads"".  Peter Travers (Rolling Stone) gave it 2 stars and complained that Wahlberg sleepwalks through the film. The NY Times called the story absurd and referred to the film as ""thrill free"".

Despite the poor reviews, ""Contraband"" earned more than $20 Million in its opening weekend and is on schedule to  hit the $100 Million mark.

Bottom line - if you're a Mark Wahlberg fan you'll enjoy this one, but it is clearly one of his lesser accomplishments.",1330992000,72,2414,4.894607843137255
