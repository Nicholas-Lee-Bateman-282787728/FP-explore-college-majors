2556686,5,B000FA57H6,"This show is so great. I remember watching it as a kid, and thinking it was funny, but now I'm older and understand all of the hidden innuendos and double entendres. I recommend this show to all people looking to sit back and have some fun. I still don't know why it took so long to come out on DVD, but oh well...",1149033600,5,314,4.0
2556687,5,B000FA57H6,"I was older when this show came out (I was a junior in High School), but I absolutely loved it! I remember hurrying home so I could watch it before I went to work, and have many episodes on grainy VHS tapes from the many times I had to work early and was forced to miss it!

That being said, I found my VHS tapes a little less than a year ago and decided to watch them. Was the show as awesome as I remembered or had I been all nostalgic about a show that, as a 28 year old, I would think was lame?

Not in the slightest! While there are definitely some characters that are irritating, they are the same ones that were irritating to me when the show was new. (The Hip Hippos and Katie KaBoom being foremost in my mind)

Animaniacs is witty and cutting, fun and completely crazy. The song bits are wonderful and the Wakko's America song is still the only reason I know that Columbus is the capital of Ohio! ;)  They poke fun at a broad range of people, movies, TV shows....well, they really poke fun of everything! From the hilarious ""Potty Emergency"" episode (who can't relate to Wakko's plight in that one?) to the painting of the Sistine Chapel, Yakko Wakko and Dot were consistantly funny, occasionally raunchy (but in only the most subtle of ways). Many of the jokes go completely over the heads of small children, but there is enough slapstick to keep them entertained.

13 years later the show is FINALLY being released on DVD and it is about time! Now, if Tiny Toons could just get the same treatment!",1148601600,11,1508,4.333333333333333
2556688,5,B000FA57H6,"Well at last! thats all I can say. I used to record these eps on video back in the day. Still remember Yacko naming the countries the world map AND making it rhyme.

It was the cartoon that brought us the famous slogan ""what are we going to do tonight brain?  The same thing we do every night pinky...........try to take over the world'  Yeah!",1148428800,2,343,4.246153846153846
2556689,4,B000FA57H6,"So, is this show as good as these other reviews are claiming? Yes and no.

Certainly this TV-made show, more than any other, comes close to the quality of the classic Looney Tunes cartoons. Unlike Tiny Toons which relied too heavily on the ""look, they look like young versions of the Looney Tunes!"" factor, Animaniacs blasted onto the screen in a flash of originality.

The problem lies with the format of the show. As it featured a number of different characters the quality of the show depended on which characters appeared that day. The Warners (brothers and sister) were the stars and deservedly so. Riffing on the Warner back catalogue (both animated and live-action) without being reliant on it, the wacky adventures of these characters were the spine of the show. Also a highlight were Pinky and the Brain (so good they got their own show) and Slappy Squirrel (""You remind me of a young Scappy Doo!""). The rest of the characters were less successful. Mindy and Buttons was a variation of the tired old 'runaway child and victim babysitter' scenario that has been done by Popeye, Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit to name a few (although one episode brilliantly referenced this with look-alikes of all these characters chasing babies around a construction site). Goodfeathers, although amusing initially, was a one joke wonder that really went over the heads of anyone who wasn't familiar with the films it parodied and Rita and Runt didn't seem to even have one joke to keep it going. The less said about the Hip Hippos the better although Chicken Boo was a welcome sight as long as his segment didn't last more than 60 seconds.

All this said, many of the best moments come when one or more of these characters made cameos in the cartoons of others and one-off's such as 'The Flame' showcased some beautiful writing and characters that would not have otherwise had a forum.

As with Tiny Toons, this show seemed to have various units animating it - with varying quality - and the writing was also a little hit and miss at times. Perhaps I'm just being picky and as I say, this was (and still is) head and shoulders above any other TV cartoons before and since.

The theme tune deserves 5 stars alone!",1147737600,62,2205,4.68733850129199
2556690,5,B000FA57H6,"Animaniacs is the best cartoon ever. I was waiting the longest time for them to release it on DVD. I'm so glad they finally did. Let's hope it sells well, so they weill release the other 3 sets.",1147305600,2,194,4.131578947368421
2556691,5,B000FA57H6,"They don't make 'em like they used to. I have many fond memories of coming home from school and racing to get homework done in time to watch the antics of Yakko, Wakko, & Dot. As I grow older and have invested an interest in films and stars from the early part of the century, I'm struck by how many references there are that just flew over my head as a kid! I now understand that Yakko's character is fashioned after Danny Kaye, and the Brain's Orson Wellian personality just makes me appreciate the depth and nuance that went into this wonderfully funny show. I can't wait to relive the magic!",1146787200,5,595,4.36936936936937
2556692,5,B000FA57H6,"I am so excited to see this DVD!!!.  After watching it, I will put in all the details.  I am a BIG Animaniacs Fan but my husband does not know what I am talking about.  From time to time I quote lines form the series though - my favourite ""Helloooo Nurse""

Bring it on Mr. Spielberg!!!!",1145318400,6,286,4.053571428571429
2556693,5,B000FA57H6,"I am really excited about this and hope it sells really well because I would love the whole series on DVD.

Its been a long time coming.

Its fun for all ages because there are jokes that may go over the kids heads but parents will get it. Fun for everyone.

Even the minor characters are funny remember Katie Kaboom the teen that literally blows up every time a little problem arises ? Take cover!

I'm really looking forward to seeing the Yakko,Wakko and Dot not to mention Pinky and the Brain,etc. Thanks for finally putting this well deserved treasure on DVD.",1145059200,12,563,4.490196078431373
2556694,5,B000FA57H6,"A lot of people remember ""Animaniacs,"" but not many people remember how popular it once was.  In 1993, the year these episodes appeared on the Fox network, ""Animaniacs"" was the most popular cartoon on that network, and one of the most-watched cartoons on TV. It had a cult following like few other shows of its time; alt.tv.animaniacs was one of the most densely-populated groups on usenet.  Adult and college-age viewers loved ""Animaniacs"" as much as, if not more than, the little kids; the obscure cultural references, double entendres, and good solid cartoon violence made it even more fun for an older audience.

Well, that was 1993, and over a decade later, how does this show hold up?  Very, very well.  All the things that made it so popular in 1993 -- the great lines, the imaginative visuals, the music (with the late Richard Stone leading a full orchestra, no computer-generated music allowed), the voices, the cultural references, the violence -- still work today.  The anthology format, with each episode consisting of a mix of different characters and segments, gives the show a richness and variety that most cartoon shows don't have.  And the characters are still as funny as they were in 1993: the Marx-Brothers-inspired Yakko, Wakko and Dot; elderly, amoral cartoon star Slappy Squirrel; Chicken Boo, the giant chicken forever passing for a human; and world-domination-seeking lab mice Pinky and the Brain (whose spinoff series is also available on DVD, separately).

The first DVD set contains the first 25 episodes of the series, out of a total of 99; if it sells well, three more volumes will be released.  It includes some of the show's very best segments, like the encounters with Paul Rugg's Jerry Lewis parody ""Mr. Director""; or Slappy trying to prove to her nephew that ""nobody ever dies in cartoons"" in the short ""Bumbie's Mom""; or the elaborate mini-musical ""Les Miseranimals""; or the Warner Brothers (and the Warner sister) helping Michelangelo ""paint naked people all over a church.""  Plus the famous song sequence with all (or most) of the nations of the world set to the ""Mexican Hat Dance.""",1144800000,290,2122,4.985835694050992

2556739,1,B000FA57H6,"One of the most overrated shows ever made.  All this crap did was teach kids the joys of assault, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual molestation and attempted rape.  Not to mention all kids that became furries thanks to this show.  Lets face it Minerva Mink was the true star of this crap.  Also she's a rip-off of Amy the Squirrel.  From time to time you can see animation goofs where she resembles her completely.  Warner Bros. has pretty much disowned her along with Space Jam Lola Bunny.  The songs are definitely forgettable and not really needed.  The show was crap and there's only one real laugh.  That's when Ralph the Guard gets an F and says, ""Boy my folks are gonna kill me.""  There, for all of you who aren't furries I just saved you the trouble of having to watch all 99 episodes.  For the record Yakko, Wakko and Dot are dogs.  Any idiot can see that.

2557045,5,B000FA57H6,"When I was about 8 years old I decided that I wanted to work in animation when I grew up. Fast forward to my high school years and and its at this point in my life that I made it my goal to work in animation. That notion was cemented by countless weekday afternoons in front of the tv watching the ""WB Kids"" line up which included Tiny Toon Adventures, Batman The Animated Series, Freakazoid! And Animaniacs.

I could write a dissertation on the above mentioned cartoons but seeing a as how this is an Animaniacs review, I'll keep it on point.

Animaniacs was way ahead of its time, and arguably still is for a cartoon. The quality of animation, hand drawn animation (gasp!) is unmatched by today's cartoon series. The writing on the show was Primetime sitcom worthy. The comedy chock full of sight gags, innuendo, puns, pop culture references, and self aware dialogue was the sharpest and had the widest appeal of any cartoon of that time and since. I mean really, how many cartoons can say that they were silly enough to make kids laugh, yet make references to Citizen Kane and Shirley McLaine to crack up adults? And in the same episode!

Thanks to Amazon Prime, I can watch all the seasons commercial free. And I will also buy these on DVD. Though I sure would love it if WB released a remastered BluRay collection. This series deserves it. As Wakko would say ""Fabu!""",1441843200,2,1371,4.520161290322581

I am not a fan of chicken boo (what the heck is that supposed to be about) or Buttons and Mindy (what a spoiled animal abusing brat, or Katie Kaboom.",1440374400,,471,4.269662921348314

2557300,5,B000FA57H6,"Pretty much you either get it or you don't, but if you get it, it's about as clever, witty and funny as television gets. The real payoff comes if you are culturally literate enough to catch the references and puns (some amazingly obscure) and also understand something of the historical characters and settings. But you're totally left on your own to know if something is supposed to be funny . . . I think they smaller the number of people who caught a joke, the better the writers liked it. And the songs and scoring are absolutely first-rate.

I've always believed that The Animaniacs was produced to entertain the people writing, scoring and voicing it, who were having a good time being clever and showing off their talents to their peers. So if the funny stuff sailed over your head, either because you were a kid watching a kid's show, or because you were an adult and thought you were watching a kid's show, or maybe because you just weren't quick enough, well, that was hardly their problem, was it?",1439510400,,1008,4.6

2557526,5,B000FA57H6,"As a child growing up in the 90's, shows like Animaniacs and Tiny Toons were in somewhat decent company with other kid friendly shows. They acknowledged how smart kids actually were while giving a nod and wink to older crowds. Today,  they are an anomaly. Going back and watching an episode or two of Animaniacs, it's easy to see what made it an instant favorite of many a kid in its heyday. It holds up incredibly well,  and delivers laughs with relative ease. When it wants to be smart,  it is. When it wants to be absurd,  it is. When it wants to make a statement,  it does. When it wants you to feel, it does so incredibly well.  When it wants to be an exceptional social commentary for its era,  it is. And I still can't help loving it!",1435708800,,741,4.25

The pop culture references are lost on my kids but I imagine this is what my parents felt when watching Looney Toons with me. They still laugh hysterically at the physical comedy and of course the potty humor. My boys love Pinky and the Brain and Slappy the Squirrel. I still thrill at the sound of Bernedette Peters' voice as Rita the cat and try desperately to stifle my giggles at the musical styling of Wakko as he belches the classics.

Just like the old WB cartoons it emulates the cartoons are short and wacky with lots of parts that kids love, and lots of humorous references for adults.  My children really LOVE the songs--especially the Monkey Song from the very first episode.  The intelligent songs are sometimes amazing in themselves--there's an incredibly catchy song whose lyrics consist of every country in the world, and another with every state capitol, every President (through Clinton when the show was on obviously), etc.  It's an intelligent show that is just perfect in bits and pieces that kids really love.",1410998400,,681,4.947368421052632

2558194,4,B000FA57H6,"I was an ""Animaniacs"" fan from the word go. The Warner Brothers (and the Warner Sister, Dot) update the irreverence of Bugs Bunny by about 50 years. And the early episodes, at least, hold up pretty well.

The Warners are subversively educational. Word-play is key to the humor here... and it's sometimes - maybe often - a little too sophisticated for younger minds. But for the kids, there's plenty of slapstick nonsense. Meanwhile, your kids are learning about history, science, math and who-know-what-else in the most entertaining way possible.

Music is another key here. Wakko teaches all the presidents (through Clinton) in a way kids might actually remember. And Pinky, the lab mouse, sing a song about cheeses that may actually get your kids to try something other than American ""cheese.""

Funny, sharp, and genuinely informative, ""Animaniacs"" was one of the last of the great Saturday morning cartoons. I'm happy to say to early episodes, at least, hold up very well.",1410480000,,975,5.043478260869565

It is in the vein of slapstick comedy similar to Looney Tunes or Tiny Tunes, with several different characters that each have their own personalities and humour. Pinky and the Brain, Good Idea-Bad Idea, the P-psychiatrist, and many others make up a cast of characters that is varied and entertaining. I am glad they offer this show!",1407801600,,397,4.768115942028985

2558252,4,B000FA57H6,"Though I don't always enjoy the slapstick humor, what I loved about this show was that it was educational and exposed you to art.  I was surprised when I discovered that I had quite a familiarity with classical music and art.  I realized years later that the reason for this was that classical music and art was often used in old cartoons--particularly Disney and Looney Toons.  Animaniacs follows in that tradition.  The episodes I've watched did a parody of Les Miserables.  They introduced Einstein, Picasso, and Michelangelo.

What I loved was the other cartoons that were included with Animaniacs.  Pinky and the Brain started out on this show before becoming their own show.  There was also Buttons and Mindy (which introduced some French, if memory serves), the Goodfeathers, and many others.  I also think they had two characters called Katie Ka-boom and Chicken, but they many have been in later seasons.",1406246400,,913,4.993377483443709

2558289,5,B000FA57H6,"I absolutely love the fact that Amazon Prime has started making many of these wonderful shows from the '90s available for Prime Streaming.  Keep the nostalgia machine pumping!

Animaniacs was a mainstay of many '90s kids' television watching choices.  Phrases like ""helloooooooo nurse!"" echoed through the halls of schools and can still be heard every once in a while from people in their mid-20's and 30's when the right situation comes around.  While it primarily focused on the Warner brothers (and sister), Yacko, Wacko, and Dot, the show also introduced characters who were brilliant in their own right, including Pinky and the Brain, who got their own spinoff series.

The show was not only full of zany antics and slapstick humor, but also contained a lot of topical humor, especially for a kids cartoon show.  Watching episodes of this show again as an adult, it has a completely different level of humor that is still fun to watch.  Great show, great nostalgia moments!",1401321600,,978,4.96319018404908

The writing is particularly good.  Quick whit and smart writing all shine forth in this series.  I think I appreciate the humor even more as an adult than I did as a teen.

I withheld one star because there are some themes I don't think I would introduce kids to (the running gag of the brothers ogling the ""nurse"" for example).  But, other than that, it is a solid piece of nostalgia that still hold up today.",1400371200,,524,4.350515463917525

The animation harkens back to the earlier (and glory) days of the Warners animation history--including Termite Terrace--and its setting in the Warner lot.  The shorts, like ""Pinky and the Brain"" are great.  (NARF!)  The humor is what makes it special from the beginnng to the end, there is one joke after another even in the end credits.  The humor is for both kids (the antics) and the sly references to movie stars, politicians, and other strike right at home.  And, by the way, ""HELLO NURSE!""

For all the silliness  and commentary on what was then newsworthy and noteworthy, ( in the same vein of Bugs Bunny In its day), Animaniacs does note push a political agenda.

The best contribution Warner Bros has made to animation since the original Looney Tunes.  Some of the familiar participants made it to their own shows (Pinky and the Brain), while others are just found here. The whole cast of crazies Slappy Squirrel, the Good Feathers and Rita and Runt as well as Good Idea/Bad Idea made afternoon cartoons in the 80's fun. The sets are boxed well and closed captioned...packed for safety I would recommend them to anyone who remembers the  show (and if you don't you should get them and laugh for the first time now).",1392076800,,644,4.591304347826087

This was a show that I loved as a kid and now both of my toddlers love it too.  Their wackiness is enough to make my 2 and 5 year olds laugh out loud, but the thing that I love about it is how intelligent the writing is, something that was clearly over my head as a child.  There are lots of references to the period the Animaniacs were originally supposed to have been created and a lot of trivial pursuit type of commentary that I love and find funny.  I would definitely rate this show amongst so many others created in the 90's that were more of a mature dialogue with a youthful appeal, similar to Ren and Stimpy, and 95% of what the cartoon network was airing.  Another great part about the show are the other characters which I had completely forgotten about, Pinky and the Brain, Scrappy the Squirrel, the little boy who tells adult jokes (""my friends mom was sitting on her porch one time and she felt something lick her foot and she thought it was her dog but it was really this weird guy who used to do that a lot), and countless others.  I get the humor in the dialogue, my kids get the humor in him dropping his ice cream and countless jokes about butts.  Good times for all!",1389225600,,1304,4.130434782608695

Watching them now is just as much fun.  This show is subversive, smart, shiny, and if you missed it before, I envy you finding it for the first time.  BTW, do not miss the Pinky and the Brain spinoff series.  Narf!",1388188800,,508,4.142857142857143

'Pinky & the Brain' are always a hoot, of course; as is 'Slappy, the Squirrel.' I don't really care for 'The Hippos,' and I can't really tell you why ... I just don't care for them. And I always have a soft spot for poor ole 'Buttons.' He has it tough and gets no respect; but Mindy is so sweet in the end of every episode and you know she loves her Buttons. 'Goodfeathers' is always a highlight, as well ... who ever said friends can't disagree sometimes ... LOL! 'Katie-ka-boom' is another one I can't find myself caring for too much ... but, oh, well. And the little snippets of 'Good Idea/Bad Idea,' as well as 'Mime Time' are always fun! Favorite episodes ... Dezanitized; Taming of the Screwy; The Flame; Wally Llama; The Great Wakkorati: the Master and His Music; Bumbie's Mom; Space Probed; among others.

2558436,5,B000FA57H6,"This is an excellent set of animation that lasts for fifty cartoons and one extra over nine hours of non-stop action.

There is no stopping these crazy, zany and fast paced animanics Yakko, Wakko and Dot as they are on the loose, running amok and wrecking havoc across the world. They are joined by your fiendish favorites - Pinky and the Brain, Rita and Runt, Slappy the Squirrel, the Good Feathers and more. Apart from the Warner Bros. and Dot I found Pinky and the Brain, and Slappy the Squirrel were the best for different reasons.

History has put down that Albert Einstein found the equation for the theory of relativity. I can prove that it isn't true, the Warner Bros. and Dot did. If you do not believe me, then watch ""Cookies for Einstein"".

The Warner Bros. push all the buttons possible and the madness is pushed to the limits of sanity, as they liberate a non-stop flow of gags, send ups, spoofs and  plain old insane madness.

I gave this first series five stars as the madness never lets up for the whole nine hours, so you should not be disappointed if you buy this dvd set.",1370304000,,1090,4.457286432160804

I know there are people out there that complain about not having any extras but I'm not one of those people as long as I have the episodes I am fine.

2558462,5,B000FA57H6,"As much as I love cartoons from the 1930s and a bit beyond (Tom and Jerry, Popeye, Mickey Mouse, Looney Tunes), I have to say that when it comes to Animaniacs, there's no need for those other shows, or even shows during its own time. It may seem like a show aimed at kids, but I can easily say it's enjoyable and a lot of fun for ages above.

Way back when (late 90s, I suppose), little SMB Madman once watched the Animaniacs movie, Wakko's Wish, on Cartoon Network. I don't remember how much I liked it back then, but when I recently (Few months ago) revisited it and watched it again, I asked myself: Why wasn't I a fan of this earlier? Then, I went on from there to watch episodes of the show.

Animaniacs is a show that is not to be missed. It has the best sense of humor I've seen from any cartoon series. There are teens/adults that wonder if they wouldn't find the show funny to them, but then they said ""JEEZ this show beats a great deal of crap spewed out on TV today!""
Plus, today's cartoons (Cartoon Network shows, in particular) have jokes that always seem to either be stale or fart jokes. Animaniacs has none of that stuff. No matter how many times I see even a same episode, I'd always end up laughing. (Just so you know, they even sneak in an adult-aimed joke or 2 on certain occasions - Kids are always likely not to notice)

There are also original songs sung in the show. Unlike every other show, in which I just feel they are unnecessary, I actually like how thought-out they are and how well they sound (I'd even wish I was born earlier once I hear Yakko sing in the episode ""A Christmas Plotz"" - His song is classic). Any educational song is also welcome, and it could even help a kid learn something valuable.

The show isn't just aimed at the Warner Bros, though. It's also about a little girl and her dog, who always ends up in hilarious situations, two squirrels (One young - Skippy, one old - Slappy), 3 pigeons, and even more characters come into the scene! Fortunately, they too have skits that are as equally funny and within quality as each other and the Warners.

It's disappointing to see that the show is not on TV anymore, and just when I was really heading back to it...
Today, the Warner Bros company is making episodes for a new Looney Tunes show, but that show is more like a cartoon sitcom that bears little to no resemblance of the original, with the exception of CGI Road Runner shorts. I wish more cartoon shows were as great as Animaniacs is.",1329955200,,2486,4.32618025751073

Yup.  And the show still holds up wonderfully today.  If you have fond memories of this show from your youth, you'll probably enjoy it more than you did then.",1198972800,,460,4.440476190476191
2558493,4,B000FA57H6,"As a child, I remember being sat in front of the television by babysitters to watch Animaniacs in an attempt to prevent me from running around the house causing trouble. My babysitter was most likely sick and tired of dealing with me, and thought it was a good bet that some cartoons would probably pacify me. The Animaniacs did not achieve the desired effect, though. Taking a cue from the mischievous, animated Warner siblings, I began to further terrorize my babysitter, which, of course, resulted in a loss of dessert privileges and an early bedtime.  That's not to say that The Animaniacs is not a quality show that yields laughter and entertainment, but it is not exactly the most appropriate cartoon ever made, especially not for children.
 The basic premise of The Animaniacs is very similar to that of other Warner Brothers staples like Looney Tunes: a series of short sketches starring familiar, animal characters full of slapstick humor, sight gags, and tongue-in-cheek jokes. Tertiary characters, like Slappy Squirrel, Mindy and Buttons, the Goodfeathers, and Pinky and the Brain have their own segments separate from the main characters, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, also known as the Warner siblings. Each character or character group star in their own skit, and there were often three or four skits per episode, much like how Bugs Bunny would have his own skit with Elmer Fudd, and then Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote would be in a separate segment in an episode of Looney Tunes.
 Watching Animaniacs as an adult is extremely different than watching it as a child. All of the jokes, references, and gags land full-on, whereas some of the jokes might go over the head of a lot of children. For instance, in an episode titled ""Temporary Insanity"", the Warner siblings, Yakko, Wakko and Dot, working as temporary secretaries for a Warner Brother's CEO, reference celebrities from a vast array of time periods, like Wayne Newton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Also, there are references to old television shows like Lassie, Flipper, and Gilligan's Island, which would also go unrecognized by the average viewer below the age of ten.
 Also unnoticed by kids would be the constant barrage of references to the Warner Brothers Company. The WB symbol appears in almost every scene in the ""Temporary Insanity"" skit, and famous Warner Brothers films and TV shows are referenced like Batman and Tiny Tunes Adventures. It seems as though the producers of this show are attempting to use the WB symbol to catch the attention of children, so that when a movie preview runs during the commercial break and the WB symbol shows up, a child would recognize it and pay attention to the commercial as they would the actual show.
 Animaniacs was certainly a quality show full of funny premises, gags and characters, and would be perfect for young adults catching up on nostalgia, but it seems like it was not intended for an audience of children. There is just too much violence, adult humor, and references to old movies and shows for children to be the focus audience of the program. Perhaps the Warner Brothers studios were attempting to create a transcedent cartoon that attracted more adults and teens that it did children, because it certainly seems to be aimed at a more learned audience in the realm of pop culture. It's possible that many kids would react similarly to the way I did when I was there age, taking a cue from the mischief makers and terrorizing the nearest authority figure.",1194739200,2,3481,4.893220338983051
2558494,5,B000FA57H6,"Its about time they released these cartoons on DVD. They are hillarious, I love the inteligent comedy and writing that went into these. They don't make them like this anymore. If you are looking for slap-stick inteligent humor this is the DVD for you! I also recommend you buy all the other seasons too to fully appreciate all the humor! Nothing beats slappy squirrel at woodstock! And the wheel of morality is my favorite!",1186099200,,423,4.72972972972973
2558495,5,B000FA57H6,"The 1st volume in the Animaniacs is quite possibly the best. The 2nd volume is either as good or even better. Yakko Wakko and Dot are comic gold in this volume. I remember when I was a kid and this was the ONLY good kids show on WB. Each of the other skits are hilarious as well. I love how they make parodies of real people. I love Yakko's talkative nature and jokes. I love Dot's self proclaimed ""I'm Cute"". I really love Wakko's (my favorite character) goofy personality and enormous eating habits. This show should have won an Oscar. It's better than most of Speilberg's movies. I'm so glad they finally released this show on DVD. They need more shows like this. Bring on the 4th volume already!!!!! ""Goodnight Everybody""!!",1184716800,,727,4.557251908396947
2558496,4,B000FA57H6,"I have been a fan of the show ""Animaniacs"" since I was a kid, and revisiting the show since Warner Brothers started releasing the show in volume sets last year. The show captures the zaniness and unpredictability of the classic Looney Tunes cartoons, while establishing their own identity. However, ""Animaniacs"" is styled like a variety show, with the three Warner siblings (Dot, Yakko and Wakko), Slappy the Squirrel, the Goodfeather, Rita & Runt, Mindy & Buttons and other supporting cartoons sharing the spotlight in each episode.

The first volume set sees the release of the first 25 episodes of the series on five dual-layered discs and are uncut. Unfortunately, this show isn't given the regal treatment that ""The Simpsons"" are privy to -- we get a good 25 minute retrospective interview special featuring the voice actors, voice director Andrea Romano and composers Steven and Julie Bernstein. They're funny, informative and filled with information... one wonders why the voice actors (such as Tress MacNeille) couldn't have sat down to do a couple of commentaries for the episodes, considering that Maurice LaMarche and MacNeille have done so for ""The Simpsons"" and ""Futurama"". There are also trailers for other WB stuff on disc 3 too, but nothing to get excited over.

However, the box set falters on the video presentation. The episodes look like they were transferred from a video source instead of the original film source, with persistent jagged edges, interlacing and occasional blocking glaringly apparent in some episodes. The episodes haven't been remastered, and if you're watching it on a high-end television screen (or on the computer) it won't hold up as well if you were watching it on regular television sets. Still, the colors are fairly vibrant, detail is good for the most part and black levels are good. Had some restoration effort been put into the episodes and been progressively encoded, they'd look better. Still, the video presentation is perfectly acceptable and adequate for a show produced in the mid 1990s.

The audio fares much better. Warner Home Video took care into remastering the audio in full-blown Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (the original stereo audio is included). These aren't demo-worthy tracks, but they give a nice sense of spaciousness and gives life to the orchestral scores (the bass line of the music is really the only thing that tests the low frequencies in the 5.1 remix). However, the side and rear speakers do come to life occasionally, such as the instance where Dot, Yakko and Wakko take control of the spaceship on ""Space Probed"", and you can hear the spaceship zooming past and by you. It's a nice touch on the WB's half to do this, even though the show doesn't really warrant it. In addition to the English 5.1 and 2.0 tracks, an optional Portuguese mono dub is included for all the episodes in this set. All the episodes in here are cut into 4 chapters each for easy access (and come with the helpful ""play all"" option) and there are optional French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles included as well.

If you're a fan of animation in general, have kids or happen to be in love with the Warner siblings, then this set comes recommended. The video could be better, but the audio and extras are surprisingly good. Add to it a fairly low price, and it's pretty much worth it.",1178236800,,3337,4.921847246891652
2558497,5,B000FA57H6,I do not think that Animaniacs was appreciated as much as the cartoon should have been.  From the Warners to Pinky and the Brain this one hundred mile an hour show was more fun to watch and laugh with then any cartoon released in the last 20 years.  A lot of the gags go a little beyond the younger audience and I would think teens and adults would love every minute.,1171929600,2,367,4.154929577464789
2558498,5,B000FA57H6,"Jeezo, what can I say? Animaniacs was a wacky cartoon, with all the classics in it: anvils, mallots, ""Bugs Bunny-ing"" enemies, and even the occasional fallen piano. It's kid friendly, but not completely kid based. Alot of the joke were of celebs, stupid commerials, and fraises a nine-year-old wouldn't normaly get. In my opinion the little shorts like Slappy Squirrel and Good Feathers (Good Fellas) aren't that great, in fact boring. I recommend this to any parent, grandparent, older sib, or old fan. Animaniacs could cancel every other cartoon in this day and age if it was aired again.",1171065600,3,590,4.96969696969697

Also, I find it fascinating how much can be learned from this show. While I wouldn't recommend it as a solely educational tool, it is helpful for sneaking in some information to younger viewers (much in the same way National Treasure teaches history while being primarily entartaining). I especially enjoy Yakko's Countries of the World song.

I bought this as a gift for a friend, and we watched it together, and I'm now inclined to add this set to my own collection as well.",1168300800,,627,4.260504201680672

Anyway, I only got to see a couple episodes out of this, but it's great!  I would definitely recommend this series if you've got the proper sense of humor for it.  If you like silly slap-stick comedies and parodies, then you'd probably like this.  It's even got the little cartoons like Slappy the Squirrel and Pinky and the Brain in it.",1168300800,,617,4.424778761061947

2558507,4,B000FA57H6,"It was everything I hoped for. Just like any show, I'm irked that you have to sit through the credits in every episode, but at least Animaniacs changes it up, and there's something different to see.",1168300800,,198,4.527777777777778

2558509,4,B000FA57H6,"I remember Animaniacs from elementary and middle school.  It was funny, and even my mother liked it!  Now that I'm older (old enough to say ""back in my day..."") and possibly less mature, it's still a blast to watch.  And it's not just from the dynamite...

So why not 5 stars?  The DVD case lists the episodes for 4 of the 5 DVDs.  Not well planned, was it?  Also, they use the same menu for all of the DVDs, which looks nice, but there are only special features on one of the discs.  Speaking of which, the interview is good.  Nothing like photo galleries or shorts, but it was nice to see the actors behind the voices.  Wakko's voice actor really fits the role.  The only other thing possibly worth losing points on is the video quality.  But I guess that's to be expected of something from the video tape era.  It looks much better than when I saw it on TV, constantly adjusting the antenna because my area didn't get the WB very well.

This collection has 25 episodes on 5 discs.  It has the famous episodes including many songs.  I learned my state capitals from Wakko.  ^_^  I really appreciate Slappy the Squirrel, now that I can understand things like, ""Hello, exposition.""

I don't laugh at the cartoon violence anymore, but I smile inside whenver there's an anvil dropped.  As Yakko says (paraphrased), ""It's amazing what they're getting away with on cartoons nowadays.""  I still don't recognize most of the famous people they parody, but I'll leave that to my parents.

2558510,5,B000FA57H6,"Buy these DVDs and watch 'em with your kids. There is so much going on here and while kids may not get all the references to history, personalities (Orson Wells as the Brain), the experience of seeing them will give them a future baseline to refer to as they (hopefully) become aware of the wider world.

Some of my favorite monents include the John Houseman-like character explaining that Michaelangelo, Leonardo, et al, are NOT TURTLES! Also the great songs about the universe, planets (""you forgot uranus!""), geography and the like. Wonderful episodic music, liberally quoting everything from Brahms to Gilbert and Sullivan. Subtle lessons abound, like the ""Wheel of Morality""

Lots of stuff to talk about and enjoy with kids.

Oh yeah, they are truly funny as well. Not watered-down lowest-common-denominator pap.

2558527,5,B000FA57H6,"I remember seeing the ""night time premier"" of Animaniacs with my best friend when I was in the 11th grade. We were hooked on the show and regularly watched episodes together, even if we had to tape them. (You know, that thing we did in the days before TiVO and Youtube.) Regularly we would challenge each other to find the ""strange thing"" in the credits. (Usually Kathryn Page's job title.) So when I found out that at long last the show was coming to DVD I had to have it.

(Funny enough, it was the same friend I would watch it with back in 1993 that got it for me. Friends who laugh together, stay together.)

I'm extremely pleased with this set as it has some of my favorite sketches from the show. For example the brilliant ""Meatballs or Consequences"" - a parody of Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" that also took shots at Obsession ads, Union rules, and Spielberg himself. Or the Disney bashing ""Bumbie's Mom"" that took on trying to explain how tragic cartoons aren't real to a distraught (cartoon) child.

From the first episode to the last there is a smarter level of comedy than one finds on ""Adult Swim,"" yet it is innocent enough that people of my generation can enjoy it along with their children. Though some jokes are dated for the younger generations (i.e. ""That Urkle kid"" or ""Bill Clinton plays the Sax"") it is still enjoyable after more than a (yikes) decade has passed.

Yes there could be more extras, but honestly at the current price of around $[...] [...] it's well worth it as is.

The references made in this show to classical art, literature, and historical events has never ceased to amaze me.  A few or my personal favorite memories are having Wakko recite every single state of the US including their capitals, Yakko attempting to say every word in the English dictionary, and the Animaniacs helping Abraham Lincoln write the Gettysburg Address.

The other thing that has always amazed me was the ability of the artists and writers to tie in amazing musical numbers into a half an hour show.  The amount of work that must have gone into producing these episodes astounds me to no end.  My personal favorite being the episode ""King Yakko"", nothing better than the Anvilanian National Anthem.

2558532,3,B000FA57H6,"First a comment on the packaging: couldn't the color be a little brighter? I mean, SILVER/grey, isn't that a little dull for the Animaniacs?  the outside package should represent the inside package that you're selling....right? The Warner Brothers, and Sister, Dot, is whacky, fun-loving....but silver? that's just a dull vapid color.

ok, now onto the show.

I loved it when it came out, but now I remember why I stopped watching it after the first two seasons.

the only characters worth watching are: Yakko, Whako, Dot Warner (of course) the ""heroes"" of the cast; Pinky and the Brain (at times).

The short-short bits, ""Mime Time"" is quite funny, but over done; the Wheel of Morality if quite entertaining, the bits where in the introduction how Dot always sings something different to rhyme with ""Anamany"" is clever.

the Button-Mindy Team up is tiresome, ""making fun of Lassie's loyalty""...over and over again.  I know it's also a parody of the Tom and Jerry chase to some extent, but....not funny.

Rita and Runt--aside from Rita's singing--not much to go on the Dog and Cat team.  Yeah, maybe it's a homage to a Batman/Catwoman team up, but meh.  I keep waiting for that part to end.

The Goodfellas(the three pigeons and the God Pigeon parody of the Goodfellas) just annoy me...I mean, how many comedies can there be about mobsters/and past successful movies without killing it?  I didn't even see Goodfellas, and I'm annoyed to the point to where I don't EVER want to see it.  Just watching the unhilarious pigeons make me want throw my shoe at the TV when they come on.  Couldn't stand them then, can't take them now. Ugh.

I never understood the Randy Beamum jokes; nor cared much for Slappy the Squirrel, though she could be funny at times.  (like the one about 'Bumbie's Mom dying and how cartoon characters never die')

I must admit, the thing that drew me to the show were the cultural references, like H.M.S. Yakko, or the episode they lampooned the Broadway show, Les Miserables; their cultural references and hidden messages are often like the Simpsons.

Still entertaining and the art is quite fluid and well preserved.",1161907200,5,2138,4.8429752066115705

I'll start on the packaging. The case itself is made of cardboard (I personally hate these types of cases... but that's just me.) and it has lovely artwork. The inside has a little episode guide telling you what episode is on which disc. The discs are nice also. Each features a different character on it and they look really nice. The DVD menus were a dissapointment though. All the discs have the same menu design and play the theme song over and over and over again. The theme was just taken from an episode because the sound effects and such were still there. They could have just put a nice little instrumental to the song or something... Also, only one disc has special features... yet every disc has the ""special features"" option. Just a little annoying. Oh well. I wasn't really expecting anything great, so it's OK.

The actual animation is round and curvy, as compared to the jagged straight style of today, and the characters are classically insane. The ensemble cast gives a great format to the show, mixing it up enough to keep your interest no matter which cartoon team is the focus of each episode (although the Warners appear in every episode, but that is a good thing!).

2558541,4,B000FA57H6,"Animaniacs was Steven Speilburg's last attempt to ressurect the glory days of the old comedy cartoons like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, and aside from those classic cartoons I just mentioned, and maybe the Fairly Oddparents, it was possibly the funniest animated show ever made.  Like Looney Tunes, however, it was divided into many different segments, with many different kinds of characters who each did their own style of humor in their own time.  All of them had a few things in common, however.  They all seem able to survive terrible, crushing punishments except when the plot demands otherwise and all regularly travel to other time periods for sketches involving historical figures like Cleopatra, Pavlov and Beethoven.

To start with, the stars of the show were the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister (Yakko, Wakko and Dot.)  Like the Marx brothers, each of the warners seems assigned a specific style of humor to milk as the cartoon progresses.  Yakko is in charge of most of the verbal humor, Wakko the most intense physical humor and Dot pretty much everything else, but especially jokes involving feminine things like outfits, makeup and pets.  Together, they traveled all over the world and all throughout history, making appearances in the lives of some of humanity's most snotty historical figures, and attempting, seemingly, to add some fun to their lives.  The warners have all the insane, zany, superhuman powers we've come to expect from Bugs Bunny himself, ressurecting such classic cartoon cliches as the anvil, the mallet, the piano, and the painted doorway.  They seem to endear themselves to all the stiffest, most deplorable individuals in all of fiction (such as the pirate captain Mel, the accountant Blowski and the grim reaper) and use their ridiculous sense of humor and vast superhuman powers to make their lives miserable by pretending to be their friends.  The warners seem not to understand that they're making these poor dopes miserable, or if they do, as I suspect, they hide it well, because their main focus always seems to be on having fun and helping others to have fun, while zipping around with enough energy to power a hundred city blocks.  Of course, that's funny enough by itself, but the warners also seem to have an easy time giving viewers the fastest, funniest, wildest mixture of jokes, puns and visual gags and just letting everyone else hang on as best they can.  Undoubtedly, they were the backbone of Animaniacs.

Pinky and the Brain was both risky and brilliant simply because nothing like it had ever been tried before.  It was a show about two gene-spliced mice who try and fail to take over the world in each episode.  When phrased like that, it doesn't sound so great, but not only is physical and nonsense humor implemented better into this show than in an episode of the three stooges, but in the best episodes of the show, (like ""Where Rodents Dare,"") their failure only occurs because of some X-factor that the Brain couldn't have predicted, in which case the show becomes not merely a joke at the expense of the two mice, but also a joke on the world.  A lab mouse with vast intelligence could almost take over our planet if not for our good luck.  What a joke on us!

Rita and Runt is a segment that's something of an aquired taste.  Strictly speaking, their style of humor is the song parody, and they make their song parodies frequently and well.  The problem is that since most of the songs they parody are from classy plays or old musicals, most kids won't have heard them before, and won't get the joke.  For example, in ""Les Miseranimals,"" Rita and Runt did an absolutely brilliant parody of ""Les Miserables,"" but when I first saw the episode, I didn't think it was all that funny, because I wasn't cultured enough to appreciate the jokes.  Likewise, many of the people who are probably wouldn't watch the cartoon show, or might take offense even if they did.  A shame, really.

The Goodfeathers is possibly the single most skippable of all the animaniacs segments, except maybe Chicken Boo.  Essentially, it's three pidgeons named Bobby, Squit and Pesto, who live in some unnamed city and struggle to stay on top.  The entire show is one big parody of the Goodfellas, with other parodies inserted every so often for added accessibility, but most of the kids who watched these segments enjoyed them for the slapstick, which is more pronounced in this segment than in any of the others (although the Mindy and Buttons segments make it an awfully close fight.)  To be honest, I find the characters of the Goodfeathers to be irritating and grating after a while.

Slappy Squirrel, however, is another story.  Like Yakko, Wakko and Dot, she uses mallets, anvils and dynamite, although she doesn't do it with the rapid, youthful energy or childlike innocence that the Warner Brothers have (or at least pretend to have.)  In fact, she'd cynical, sarcastic and overall crotchety, which is what makes the cartoon so funny for me.  Some of her jokes tend to be pretty esoteric, however, so she also is an aquired taste.

Mindy and Buttons was a segment that was probably intended to be a series of chase scenes like the Road Runner and the Coyote.  Now, maybe I'm just too idealistic, but I found myself pitying Buttons too much to really enjoy these shows.  Basically, Mindy is a cute kid who runs off after something and winds up in a whole lot of danger.  Buttons is a dog who chases her and saves her from harm, though he is frequently pounded in the process.  The problem is that there's really no character in this segment who's a bad guy, yet there's plenty of pain and suffering for Buttons, which, to be honest, I don't find funny.

The Hip Hippos are a unique style of humor.  Essentially, there are two rare, endangered (allegedly) hippoes called Hippopotamus Trendolious, who go by the names of Flavio and Marita.  They're allegedly married, although it's not stated directly, and they're big on fresh trends, so they moved their rich estate to the top of a skyscraper in the city, where they live as best they can in a world too small for them.  I find that this cartoon really started to get funny when the character of the nature scientist was introduced.  She wants to study the hippos and protect them from danger, but of course, since they're both not only extremely heavy and strong, but also virtually invulnerable, she's probably just wasting her time, and she usually gets a pounding in the process.  For some reason, I find this funnier than the Mindy and Buttons sketches, probably because the scientist is so foolish and overworried.  Many kids have parents like that, myself included, and wouldn't mind seeing them get a smacking for trying too hard to protect us.

Chicken Boo is probably the least funny cartoon segment I've ever seen outside of action cartoons.  Basically, he's a man-sized chicken who puts on a human disguise and impersonates a human in man's world.  In each cartoon, he's dressed as a different human, but the same thing happens.  He dazzles everyone with amazing feats that most humans are incapable of, then something happens and the disguise falls off, and they're all so mad at him, they usually beat him up.  I guess it's just that there's nothing funny about racial prejudice, which is really what this cartoon is about, no matter what disguise it wears.

Aside from these, there are also two cartoons in this collection that don't feature any of these characters.  One is about a talking flame on a candle in Thomas Jefferson's study when he drafted the Declaration of Independance, and the other about a lovesick flying bug who has to go through some difficult times to win the butterfly of his dreams.  Neither of these cartoons are really all that funny, although the bug cartoon has its own charm and the flame has some adorable responses to its situations.  In general, one viewing of each is enough.

In addition to these, this collection also contains super-shorts, such as the Randy Beaman Boy, in which a boy appears and tells a silly story about a kid named Randy Beaman's family, Mime Time, which features a mime practicing his art and being clobbered, usually in a funny way (example; throwing an imaginary football gets him tackled by half a dozen burly football players) and my personal favorite; ""Good Idea, Bad Idea,"" featuring Mr. Skullhead, who first does something smart, then something stupid related to it (Stopping to smell the roses-stopping to feel the roses...)  You get the idea.

Overall, the Animaniacs is one of the best, funniest, cheeriest cartoons I've ever seen.  It's WAY better than what passes for Kid's shows these days, and it was enough to cheer me up when I was feeling down, even now that I'm an adult.  What more could I ask of this kind of cartoon?",1156464000,6,8811,4.778877887788779
2558542,5,B000FA57H6,"I have been waiting for these collections for as long as I realized such a thing could exist... This has got to be one of the greatest cartoon shows of the '90s, and it has aged remarkably well (though what we say about it in 40 years may be different). Quality animation, hillarious gags, and broad audience appeal. Very  much like the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons from the 50s in pacing and style. Favorite skits from this set include 'HMS Yakko' and 'King Yakko' for fantastic use of music! Can't wait for the other season sets!",1156464000,,540,4.625
2558543,5,B000FA57H6,"This cartoon was the best show since the Disney Afternoon line-up of Gummi bears, Ducktales, Talespin, and Chip N' Dale.  I was in elementary school at the time and had grown sick of Tiny Toons.  When I first saw Animaniacs, I could not believe a cartoon was this dynamic.  I was foolish to originally judge it by the look of the characters and not watch it.  But, after one episode, you realize how much good effort has been put into a kid's cartoon.  The show was very educational too.  And, the writers inserted quirky facts.  This show revitalized after-school cartoons!  The writing is tops.",1156204800,,596,4.663461538461538
2558544,4,B000FA57H6,"Animaniacs was probably the last kind of cartoon that appealed to all ages without having to resort to being overly stupid with their jokes and writing like other shows (er-hem: Spongebob). And the first season has everything that Animaniacs fans young and old will remember; I'm sure even the casual viewers of the show remember its infamous states and countries soungs.

But, as most other reviewers on this site have mentioned, Animaniacs was often very hit and miss with its writing. The main thing attributing to this problem was that there were just so many chracters with minisodes of their own that were so different (yet, subtley similar) to each other. Then again, with this show finally getting a DVD release, the magic of the ""next"" button fixes any problems if you just despise some of the show's erm... shows (for me, this would be those two Hippos with the accents; you can only go so far with fat jokes!).

Now, for the actual DVD content. Surprisingly enough, the discs were released in what some may call ""fold-out-book"" format (like those ""Friends"" boxed sets), as opposed to the thin discs (which tend to take up more room on your shelf) as most cartoons sets have been released in outside of your superhero cartoon sets. Oddly enough, only WB cartoon shows have been releasing their ""old"" cartoon shows like this, which is disappointing, since the ""FOB"" format is way nicer than the thin disc releases. Like other sets, the episodes on each disc are listed on the menu as well as the flaps of the actual set.

Also, outside of the previews in the extras section, there's no other self promotion like slips of ads put in the package or commercials for other sets being inserted right before the DVD menu, which is convenient. Sadly, there's only one real extra-- the interview with the cast of the show, which is as long as an episode of the show (like 25 minutes). Though as short as the collective interviews were, I enjoyed hearing how the cast originally worked on past shows like Tony Toons and Tazmania before working on said show. Strangely, this special is put on the third disc, not the first or last, but whatever.

So to wrap things up, Animaniacs was a hit or miss show, but was a hit for the most part, which is most likely why it was given such a great release, unlike other shows like Inspector Gadget, which can only be found in online stores, and only if you're aware of its release in the first place!",1155600000,6,2439,4.625866050808314
2558545,3,B000FA57H6,"""Spartan"" is the word that comes to mind when I think of this release. While the 5-disc set faithfully captures many of the first episodes of Animaniacs, it is lacking in many (or any) of the features that consumers have come to expect with DVD releases of TV shows. When you buy this set, you get the TV show, and that's all. No audio commentary. No musical features. No unreleased material. No outtakes. The only treat is a 30 minute interview with the major voice actors, and that segment feels awkward and poorly produced.

I was very excited to learn of this DVD, and I'm not sad that I bought it. However, it is evident that WB released this DVD just to see if there was a market for it. I hope that future Animaniacs releases are forthcoming, and that they reward fans with those goodies that we have come to expect from TV-to-DVD releases.",1155340800,16,847,4.464516129032258

Just like the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons from the 40's, these work on so many levels. The innuendo, the cultural references, the style...it's all timeless. I've made it my mission to introduce my wife to the series and this was the perfect way (replacing the VHS copies I made from the shows original airing). This series was the perfect example of what to do ""right"" with an animated series. It's true not all the characters worked well (the one joke Katie Ka-Boom, Favio and Marita) but the show had enough variety to make it interesting. You never knew what you were going to see from show to show. One one episode you may see the Warners at the height of zany, and the next you'd be touched on your heartstrings by the tale of some wrapping paper and it's journey through the world. It's was completely unpredictable and that was refreshing. Most cartoons today are predictable and bland. The unique factor that made Animaniacs work so well was it's ability to take us on strange and wonderful trips. The non-sequiter facet of the humor provided a great springboard for satire and parody. Characters like Chicken Boo are a perfect example of this. I actually owned a rat (white of course) and everyday it tried to escape from its cage, just like Pinky and the Brain. Basically we all wish we had a bit of the Warners in us.

2558553,4,B000FA57H6,"Most people that would buy this already know how funny this show was, or have read the other reviews and see how much this show was appreciated.

But one problem.  The transfer is poor by todays standards.

On my computer, the video playback was fuzzy, speckled, and subject to scanline shift during movement, which when I have seen that in other DVD sets related to a cheap transfer using a used (non-master) copy.  I can live with a low rate transfer, but the speckling is unacceptable.  A clean master should have been used for the process.

When played on my doubleres bigscreen using component input, the scanline shifting dropped considerably, but the picture still showed the speckling and lack of sharpness.

Still wonderful to have these finally come out, but a cleaner copy would have made me happier.  Here's looking forward to the ""Enhanced and Restored version in 2012 (Dot guessed the year for me.)",1154304000,7,912,4.838709677419355

Not one was contacted. No one from WB bothered to involve them in any way(in background info, commentary, interviews, artwork supplements etc.), which makes crystal clear how that company really feels about the huge contributions of the very, very hard-working original staff.  Contrary to what one might think, it wasn't all scripts and ""writing"" that made this show a hit.  While on the air the artists got no attention in the press and it's bizarre that that attitude continues to this day--when in fact some of the original crew still works for WB Animation, in the same building, no less.  Hey, thanks, WB.  Pathetic!

That said--enjoy the cartoons.  Freeze frame the credits if you want to know who enjoyed drawing them for you.",1154304000,11,991,5.0060975609756095

""Are we dead?""
""Or is this Ohio?""

This is obviously a must-have for fans, and I for one am hoping to encourage WB to release more collections by purchasing this one. No, not every single segment is truly fantastic, especially in this first collection when the shows were just getting going and hadn't quite hit their stride.

Each episode has the main cartoon sets, but sadly, they are lacking the neat little in-between skits, so the episodes are not truly full-length.  What happened to Mr. Skeleton Head and his ""Good Idea-Bad Idea"" bits or the little boy who gives quick little oratories on what happened to his friend Randy Beemis?  Those and other short pieces added so much to the fast, mad-cap pace of the show, which I loved along with my kids.  If WB is already preparing the next volume, it may be too late to suggest (or insist) they restore each entire episode.  They really, REALLY need to rethink that.  Even so, I have already been enjoying my first volume.  Some of the best episodes are yet to come, such as their take-off on Star Wars and my favorite ""Slappy at Woodstock.""  Slappy is actually my favorite character.  I can identify with her cynicism.  I don't feel there are any bad episodes among the 99 WB produced, but WB lost one star for not putting in the little skits I mentioned above.  I hope and pray the other sets will be forthcoming.

This show really is underrated.  It's not just funny, I love the Warners as characters too.  The educational stuff is a little lame, but nothing is perfect.  'Animaniacs' is definitely the best American TV cartoon.  Has anyone else noticed that Grim from 'The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy' is a total rip-off of the Grim Reaper in 'Meatballs or Consequences'?

2558561,5,B000FA57H6,"First they premiered on Fox Kids.  Then they moved to the more permanent Kids WB.  Later, they were rerun on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.  Now they're finally out on DVD !

Who or what am I explaining about ?  The Animaniacs, of course !

Yes, Animaniacs is perhaps one of the greatest cartoon shows ever made within the past decade or so.  It's a series like you have never seen before - compared to most animated series today.  It's got lots of funny bits and puns as well as humorous sketches with a little bit of innuendo and other stuff that spawned today's hit series.

This awesome hit series usually centers around three, um..., characters named Yakko, Wakko, and Dot - better known as ""The Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister"".  These nutty guys cause a whole lotta trouble wherever they go; it's no wonder they were locked away in the Warner Bros. studio water tower for many years.  Of course, the Warners couldn't have done this amazing series without their very own supporting cast.

Here's the who's who on these comical characters (for those that don't remember or even seen this series):

Yakko: He's a smooth yet nonstop talker, hence his name.  He's got a nice pair of slacks and a lot of wisdom to boot.
Wakko: He wears a big red hat, an oversized sweater, and, oh yeah, no pants.  He's got a big sack of tricks and an even bigger appetite to boot !
Dot: Simply put, she's cute.  But don't let her dainty appearance fool you ... too much.
Doctor Otto Sratchansniff: The psychiatrist of the Warner movie lot.  Perhaps his biggest case is the Warners themselves.
Hello Nurse: The doctor's voluptuous assistant, a definite portrait of beauty and brains.  Not even Wakko and Yakko can take their eyes off of her !  (Neither can I !)
Thaddeus Plotz: The hotheaded CEO of the Warner Bros. studio.
Ralph the Guard: The overweight, dimwitted security guard who spends most of his time chasing the Warners and locking them back in the tower they came from.
Pinky and the Brain: Two lab mice with one mission - world domination.  The Brain has the smarts and the plans, while Pinky has ... well, Narf !
The Goodfeathers: A trio of pigeons consisting of Bobby, Pesto, and Squit.  They follow thier leader, the Godpigeon, and always stay together, even if they don't get along too well.
Mindy: A precocious preschool-age girl who is curious of almost everything she sees.
Buttons: Mindy's overprotective pet pooch who usually takes the blame in the end.
The Hip Hippos: Marita and Flavio are a happy hippo couple that recently moved out of the jungle to a new way of life in the city.
Rita and Runt: An odd housepet pair consisting of a serenading cat and a dumb dog searching for a home.
Slappy Squirrel: A retired cartoon starlet who complains about her life and just wants to be left alone.
Skippy Squirrel: Slappy's happy-go-lucky nephew who loves Slappy no matter what.
The Mime: He has a few-second mini-series called ""Mime Time"" which he does his thing that ends up totally wrong.

There are five discs in this collector's set with 25 full length episodes and an amazing special feature called ""Animaniacs Live!"" which is an exclusive interview specially made for this set.

I'd go on some more, but I'll be exceeding the review limit; not to mention give out too much info.  So anyway, if you think volume one probably seems enough, I think it's NOT enough !  Look for volume two this December !

Until then... ""Good Night Everybody !""",1154044800,8,3456,4.6430921052631575
2558562,5,B000FA57H6,"First off, I want to answer something from a previous review:

""However, I wish Warner Brothers would of made DVD collections for not just Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain, but for the other characters such as ""Mindy and Buttons"" ""Minerva Mink"" and my all time favorite ""KATIE KA-BOOM"" oh well I guess I'll have to wait till December!""

Um... that idea is stupid. None of those characters have enough shorts to be put onto a DVD. It'd be a waste of money. Besides, they were a part of Animaniacs and their shorts were shown during the full episodes, so they're all on this DVD (and the future 3 volumes).

As for Pinky and the Brain, their shorts are on this DVD. The DVD collection that was released was of the spinoff show they got in 1995 (two years after the premiere of Animaniacs), not of any shorts from their time on Animaniacs.

Anyway, I love Animaniacs and am really glad I bought this DVD. It's excellent and so hilarious! There are plenty of gems from the show on this DVD and I remember several of the shorts from when I first watched the show way back when. I'm glad I own them now. Can't wait for the future volumes!!",1153958400,,1135,4.390476190476191
2558563,5,B000FA57H6,"I am so thrilled that WB has finnally released this hilarious and smart show on DVD.  Animaniacs has enough wacky antics to keep younger kids interested, and enough witty dialogue and pop references to keep older kids and adults in stiches.  I grew up watching this show (in my late teens) and cant wait to get my hands on this DVD.  The shorts between cartoons (like ""Good idea, Bad idea"") are insanely funny and anytime the characters break into song you are in for a treat!  If you have never seen this show, but love cartoons, this is definitly for you.  You will wonder how you ever existed w/o the Warner's and company.",1153872000,6,625,4.495575221238938
2558564,5,B000FA57H6,"I realize Volume 1 was just released, but I've been doing some research about if and when Volume 2 will be released. From what I've read, it looks like December is the target date for Volume 2, which is perfect timing for Christmas!",1153872000,,232,4.4186046511627906
2558565,5,B000FA57H6,"Well Here it is folks 25 episiodes of Animaniacs on DVD for the first time ever! I love this show, but my personal favorite episiode is ""Baloney and Friends"" and I recomend it for people who are into anti-barney humor. Anywhey back to the warner bros. Its easy to see why this show is popular its reallly funny! However, I wish Warner Brothers would of made DVD collections for not just Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain, but for the other characters such as ""Mindy and Buttons"" ""Minerva Mink"" and my all time favorite ""KATIE KA-BOOM"" oh well I guess I'll have to wait till December!",1153872000,,584,4.518867924528302
2558566,4,B000FA57H6,"This is an excellent series and one of the best cartoons ever made in our generation. If you like spoofs, wise-cracking humor, silliness, and cute little furry creatures, you'll love this series.

This is the first volume of a scheduled 4 volume set. The second volume is scheduled to come out sometime between November and January along with the second volume of Pinky & the Brain. I don't know if the volumes will have all the episodes made, but it should make an excellent collection either way.

There really aren't that many bonus features. A little dissapointing, but I didn't buy the collection for bonus features anyway. It's the cartoons that matter, but it would be nice to have more features in future volumes.

The digital transfer of the picture is something I can't quite figure out. When playing on my traditional DVD and TV, the picture quality is excellent. However, when playing the DVD on my computer (which I usually watch movies on my computer), the picture looks horrible, even wavy. I've not experienced this poor quality with any other DVDs or series', so I conclude that it has to do with a certain type of digital transferring technology the studio used with this series. Just thought I'd warn you. For this reason, I give the DVD set 4 stars, but definately 5 stars to the cartoons themselves.",1153872000,14,1320,4.755458515283843
2558567,5,B000FA57H6,"OK, after writing a long review, then being shunted around to give my real name and not wanting to do that, I managed to erase the entire thing (lesson learned? Ctrl-C before you hit any buttons).

Bottom line:

Great series, almost as good as the originals. Lost a bit at the end, started to suffer a bit from Saturday-Night-Live-itis with some overused jokes, sketches and some running way too long (chicken Boo.)

Pinky and the Brain were MUCH funnier on this series (due to their shorter length) and other notables were the squirrel (Scratchy?), the family itself, and I believe Good Idea-Bad Idea.

I just hope this series IS the first 25 episodes, and not what they are doing with the Golden Collection from WB (which I have the first 2 volumes). I would like to be able to get a complete collection, but when the publishers start mixing, that becomes almost impossible.

Anyway, looking forward to this, and IF ANYONE IS LISTENING:

Tiny Toons

the COMPLETE WB collection (including ones you can't show nowadays!)

Freakazoid

The Tick.

They sure delivered here. Animaniacs were a huge part of my childhood. There is something truly magical and classic about these cartoons, like a lot of WB's saturday morning shows at that time, such as Batman: The Animated Series. There is only one extra on the set, but don't let that fool you, it's very lengthy, informative, and funny. It features much of the voice cast of Animaniacs. It is amost surreal seeing what they look like in real life because I associate their voices so strongly with their great little characters.",1153699200,,710,4.827868852459017

2558570,4,B000FA57H6,"There is just so much going on within the laughter of great animation on video. There have been so many classic cartoon series of the past that are getting new lights and to new audiences for DVD. That has arguably been the case with so many great cartoons from Garfield & Friends, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and especially The Simpsons. That also happened with one of Warner Brothers best animated series of the 90's, Animaniacs. The cartoon series was one of the best and zaniest of them all. Following th tales of not just Yakko, Wakko & Dot, it also captured characteers from Buttons & Mindy, Rits & Runt, and the successful spinoff Pinky & The Brain. Now, there is a taste of that great cartoon series now on home video.

Animaniacs, Volume 1 is a reflection of the first episodes of this great cartoon series from 1993. The episodes here were just as fun and looney as they were made a decade ago, and remastered well. The collection incluudes some of my favorite episodes and shorts from De-Zanitized, where Dr. Scratch N' Sniff recalls his psychology analizing of the Warners, and how messed up they really are, to La La Law, a spoof on L.A. Law, where The Warners try to help the doctor beat a misunderstood parking violation, and turn the courtroom upside down, and Les Miseribles, that highlights Rita the cat and Runt the dog on how they first meet, and their beginning on a search for a new home.

About a year ago, the series breathed new life thanks to its run on the Nicktoons network. While there are so many people who are now interested in shows like Spongebob Squarepants, and Fairly Odd Parents, the classics seem to really never die. Animaniacs, volume 1 is a great buy for all ages. It is definitely as cute as Dot is.

2558573,5,B000FA57H6,"I remember watching this show after school and on Saturdays and laughed out loud to the cultural references and bumbling violence. Even though I was around 11 I loved that it made fun of the movies, especially Batman. While I probably missed the double entendres and adult oriented jokes, I was tickled with glee just watching the violence and the slapstick jokes. I recently saw a couple of the episodes and they hold up really well if not better now that I know some of the movies that they were making fun of (ie Goodfeathers). However, the jokes are dated referencing movies and actors that are past their prime, but still funny none the less. They are still funny if you still remember the movies and peoplpe they make fun of which shouldn't be too hard. There were more songs than I remember but they are fun and some of them even teach you GEOGRAPHY. I still love the capitol of the United States song, I believe that's how I remember the capitals for a test.

Just imagine a show that has violence, slapstick comedy, cultural parody, and even a lesson to be learned, (albeit the wheel of morality jokes sometimes feel flat sometimes and were just random and funny the other times) and that is how Animaniacs come off as to someone longs for the carefree days. I still remember the universe song which stated that we're all really small. My only gripe with the disc set is the lack of season, instead they chose to lump shows together, but then again, its better than nothing.  So if one would like to walk down memory lane with a big bowl of sugary cereal and some friends with some childishness, then get the dvd and make it a night, eh, weekend morning.",1152576000,6,1663,4.503311258278146
