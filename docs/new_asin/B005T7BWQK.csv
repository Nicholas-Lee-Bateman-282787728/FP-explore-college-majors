4888243,5,B005T7BWQK,I love rugrats and am so happy its finally on dvd! I just bought this and am very happy with it. Im not totally sure its in the right order though because in one episode chaz and kira own thier coffee shop and in another later on they are just starting it. And according to wikipedia all of season 8 are on here but some of them are actually supposed to be on season 9. I am a little confused to as to why this season is so much cheaper than the others. But over all i am just super happy to finally own it.,1336867200,,507,3.8380952380952382

4888255,5,B005T7BWQK,"While this season is the same length as the first season of the series, also being presented on the same number of discs, don't say it's a bust, as it's a must to have, if you're a huge Rugrat fan, looking to have all of the seasons of Rugrats! In season 8, we get not one, but two holiday specials, a Halloween special to feature both, Dil and Kimi, as the babies go trick or treating for the first time, as well as their first Easter with Dil and Kimi, not to mention, the first Easter episode of the series, as the last time Easter came around, we got Passover instead, back in season 3, but not only is this Easter special with it being their first Easter with Kimi and Dil in Bow-Wow Wedding Vows, but Spike and Fifi have their first litter of puppies, who are later on named Spikfi and Pepper, or at least the 2 puppies the families get to keep anyway are named that. Also, in this season, we see Chaz and Kira make it official to open up a coffee shop in the episode, Sweet Dreams, and we see the official opening of the coffee shop in The Fun Way Day, when the babies try to help the Faun Sway guy makethe shop appealing to the customers. We also meet Harold, in the 22 minute episode, Preschool Days, and see that he becomes an assistant to Angelica in Angelica's Assistant. Also, in this season, we learn that Dil is too little to start walking, but at the same time, we learn how the bulk of the Rugrats started walking in A Step at a Time, and we see Didi deciding to go back to school to get her Masters in the episode, Back to School, which leads to getting a babysitter, Taffy, who's introduced in the final episode of this season, Happy Taffy, where Amanda Bynes, the voice of Taffy, is introduced. We're also back to the 2 episode format per 22 minute block in this season, as seems that 3 episodes per block as presented in season 7 was just, a bit much. No matter, it's an excellent season to have, and a must, if you're a long time Rugrat fan, or you're just getting your feet wet with these toddlers, and want to see more fun with the entire gang. It also features the direct to video episode, Murmer on the Ornery Express, as well as Curse of the Weirwolf, which was also originally a direct to video release when they originally came out. So, it's one I recommend, so don't wait, go get season 8!",1438041600,,2319,4.225225225225225

4888257,5,B005T7BWQK,My son likes the Rugrats series as he grew up with them. He has Autsim and loves to watch the old shows from Nick (the 90's are all that).,1426377600,,138,3.793103448275862
4888258,5,B005T7BWQK,Remember the Rugrats ? They were so popular now not even one airing a week. On the plus side season sets are all the rage so if you miss your rugrat fix grab a season set. Why not season 8 ? The Show has a lot of good jokes for all ages and is such a realistic program. Overall a great show to introduce to your children or to help bring back the joy of your own childhood. enjoy,1420588800,,379,3.810126582278481
4888259,5,B005T7BWQK,"AHHHH, NOSTALGIA. WHEN NICKELODEON CARTOONS DID NOT SUCK
TEENAGE PREGNANCY WAS STILL SHUNNED UPON AND VIRTUALLY UNHEARD OF IN THE NINTIES",1412553600,,137,5.571428571428571
4888260,5,B005T7BWQK,"When the 8th season of Rugrats was starting out, the 9/11 attacks happened. I don't know if it affected Rugrats any, aside from Angelica mentioning ""Sabob Who-zany"" (Saddam Hussein) in the 3rd season episode Tommy and the Secret Club. It certainly affected SpongeBob's 3rd season episode Just One Bite, other than its violently ""gas-filled"" deleted scene, and it definitely affected Digimon's 1st and 2nd seasons when Disney owned them, to the point of several episodes being banned from American TV until 2013, when Nicktoons was showing seasons 1 and 2. Anyway, the 8th season of Rugrats gave us back the show's normal 2-episodes-in-1-show formula, a new 22-minute Halloween special, Curse of the Werewuff (just as SpongeBob's own 8th season had the Halloween episode Ghoul Fools, in contrast to both shows having 2-in-1 Halloween-themed episodes in their first seasons), and the Easter special, Bow Wow Wedding Vows (and I don't mean the rapper Bow Wow); where Spike and Fifi get ""married"" and have puppies, including 2 that'd later be named Spiffy and Pepper, and respectively adopted by the Pickles and Finsters. As the 7th season set contains the real 8th season premiere episode All Grown Up, this set contains the real 7th season finale episode, Pre-school Daze, which was the pilot episode of the same-named, very-short-lived, spin-off series, and the debut of the lovable lisping ""chubby boy"" Harold Frumkin; who reappeared a few more times in the original series, Three Jacks and a Beanstalk, and in All Grown Up. This was also the final season that Christine Cavanaugh provided Chuckie's voice, due to personal reasons, and Nancy Cartwright stood in for her right after the Easter special, and for the rest of the original series, and all of All Grown Up!; Just as Candi Milo did the same for Dexter of Dexter's Laboratory at this time. This season contains all these ""'ventures"" too; like Chuckie getting and losing his new library card, the babies in ""early retirement"", Angelica being a bad radio doctor like the real one Didi listened to, the debut of Chas and Kira's Java Lava shop, a case of mistaken identity between Dil and a talking baby doll, Phil being traded to 2 girls older than Angelica so she can play with them, the babies in an aquarium and trying to teach Dil to walk (and he almost does it for Tommy, as Tommy did for Chuckie!), Chuckie being allergic to Kimi (or to her ""anniversary"" present to him), a train ride full of mystery and robbery, Okey-Dokey Jones (Tommy's alter ego from the first movie) searching for Lil's missing ""ring of the sunbeans"", Didi going off to college after realizing her child-help books only go up to age 5, the debut of Lulu's Great Niece and the babies' new sitter Taffy (played by Amanda Bynes, the star of her own hilarious comedy skit show from Nick), who's famous for calling the babies ""Minis"", like M&M's Minis, along with several other misadventures! When I got my set, Trading Phil had a freezing glitch halfway into it, so I asked for a replacement set; and I got it in just 2 days after my complaint e-mail! The glitch was fixed with the replacement set, but I don't know why I had to send back the defective set; the Warner Archive never asked me that, when I had a buggy copy of Yogi's First Christmas back in '09. Both sets I had of Rugrats' 8th season had a very short picture-and-sound glitch at the end of Hello Dilly. Crazy, ain't it? Better a tiny glitch than a big one, right? This is the last whole DVD season set to use single-layered DVD-R discs and no closed-captioning, because the whole 9th and final season fixed and improved such problems! If you're a longtime fan of Rugrats and want all 9 seasons of the original series on DVD, add this landmark season to your collection today!",1408492800,2,3771,4.767584097859327

4888263,5,B005T7BWQK,"This 3 DVD set has all episodes from Season 8 of Rugrats. I am a bit confused about how the episodes are recorded onto the dvd's, because on one disc the episode where Chas and Kira open the coffee shop comes before the one where they actually buy the coffee shop. But the discs play fine, I have watched every episode and there was only a problem with the disc freezing in one episode and that only lasted a second or two. There are also no commercials at the beginning of any of the discs.",1384041600,,491,4.178947368421053
