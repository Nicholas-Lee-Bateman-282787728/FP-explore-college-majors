What followed was like seeing Santa Claus get shot at Christmas.  It's hard to pinpoint what misses, but it does miss.  Maybe I just built up my expectations.

2201469,4,B00076QNZS,"My wife and I were browsing online for a sex position video and we came across this DVD.  We purchased this DVD to add variety to our sex life.

For the guys out there, I must warn you about what the DVD isn't about.  The DVD does contain nudity, but there isn't any hard core action (Though I doubt if Amazon would allow any hard core DVDs on their site).  I did expected to see more explicit scenes, but unfortunately I didn't.  My wife however absolutely loved this DVD and said that the DVD was tasteful and thought that it would lose it's appeal to the female crowd if the DVD was more explicit.  I guess there will always be a gender gap between the sexes.

However, this DVD did do what it was meant to do.  The DVD did give pointers, tips, and techniques for both sexes.  The DVD did give various positions other than the same old positions that are out there.  One position that you must look out for is the ""Bavarian Brute"".

I also expect that this DVD was made for couples to watch together.  I do admit that when we watched it the first time, we didn't get that far into the DVD before we started making love.  The DVD did get both of us in the mood so the purchase was definately worth it.

Overall, the DVD was great.  It was professionally filmed, the three play modes added to the DVD, and all three couples in the DVD were attractive.  I give this DVD 4 stars since it wasn't as explicit as I thought it would be.  I am sure that my wife would have given it 5 stars.",1108166400,238,1484,4.150877192982456

I can't fault anything about this, and would certainly purchase another in the series. This is the type of DVD that I wish I had as a teenager curious about sex, but is also very relevant as a thirty-something year old. The positions include both regular and advanced, and have tips on how to increase stimulation and cautions to watch for. It has three main series - male superior, female superior, and a beautiful set of positions using seated positions on a kitchen chair.

The best thing about this DVD is that opposed to other DVDs that you watch once, get the ideas and then have to pass along to a friend, this is one that you can keep as something tasteful to play in the background of the bedroom.",1168732800,23,939,4.684848484848485

There also aren't that many different positions in this DVD anyways.  It's too short.

2201485,5,B00076QNZS,"I have purchased a number of adult / sex educational DVDs (of US origin) in the past - and usually been disappointed with either the content and / or the quality of the filming or production of these - sending them straight back and vowing never to order such DVDs ever again!

But this DVD (and its predecessor: `Sex Essentials Videos: Seductive Sex Positions' [2005] DVD) caught my eye whilst casually browsing Amazon. These seemed well made, and -clearly - some thought had gone into their design (for example, having a choice of `educational' spoken-word instruction or `sensual' background mood-music is an excellent offering).

But `why?' buy these DVDs? What do they actually achieve? To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure myself at time of purchase - other than, like some other reviewers - I was simply searching for that illusive `new' inspiration to give (just a little) spice to an otherwise perfectly enjoyable and successful loving physical relationship with my wife over the past 18 years.

But the `answer' came in the first few minutes of the introduction, where our hosts (quite correctly) point out that, whilst many couples have had (and continue to have) successful, loving sex; many (and I am happy to be completely honest when I say that we definitely fall into this category) end-up only employing a small fraction of a vastly greater selection of the possible (and physically achievable) love making positions that are at our disposal (perhaps its lack of time, lack of energy after a tiring day, or simply the hectic pace of modern life which does not leave us enough time for ourselves to indulge in `experimentation' beyond our familiar tried and tested `norm').

These quality DVDs provide a tasteful (but never the less genuinely stimulating) summary of lovemaking positions, usefully categorised into groups such as: `Male Superior' (Man-On-Top), `Female Superior' (Women-On-Top), `Side-By-Side', `Sitting', and `Rear Entry' etc.

Each of these groups is introduced by one of the two attractive hosts (whom I was not personally previously aware of - sorry Ladies! - you obviously haven't broken into the 'UK' yet; but who - never the less - bring a tasteful and professional air to the production, suitably yet sensually dressed, and appropriately scripted). Each group section has a briefly acted `Intro' scene to it - to `set the mood'? - in which a couple prepare themselves for the lovemaking to follow (personally, I did't see the point of these scenes and would have been happy if they had not been included, but that's just my feeling - they may well be of interest to others!).

There are then 5 or 6 individually `named' positions (within each group category), which are tastefully (but not `coldly' or `mechanically') demonstrated by one of three couples appearing on the DVD (a different couple presents a different Group of Positions). Each position's demonstration lasts between 2 to 3 minutes (at the most) before moving on to the next, and each is initially `titled' for ease of navigation / selection. The total programme last approx. 1 hour (each DVD).

After reviewing these DVDs alone (to see exactly what these presentations `were' - and what they `were not'); I then persuaded my wife to view them with me (as she is not usually interested in viewing such material - educational or otherwise).

After a present evening weagreed that - whilst these DVDs will not `revolutionise' our physical love making in one go (we actually discovered that we do actually practice / have practiced many more of these various `variations' than we first gave ourselves credit for!) - these DVDs will most definately provide some fresh and thought-provoking original variants, which we will - with luck - continue enjoy trying in the future.

Only a few `words of warning' (for they are not really `warnings' as such) to prospective purchasers / viewers of these DVDs - which are simply that you should (perhaps) not expect to be able to even attempt - let alone achieve - some of the positions / variations presented here! There is no doubt that - for some - you will need to be very physically fit and have ample stamina (we do NOT!), and also you and your partners' height and physical frame sizes may also be prohibitive (the couples shown are - of cause - `perfect' muscular specimens, in the case of the men, and slim, light, and petit framed nymphs, in the case of the women - far different from many purchasers out here in the `real' world!).

Further, some of the positions / variations shown require (or would greatly benefit from having) certain types of furniture available (as illustrated in the DVDs) - I'm specifically thinking here about a suitably strong low wooden coffee table and a suitably large and robust Kentucky style Wooden Kitchen / Dining Room Chair - you simply may not have such things in your house right now; but (like me) you may soon after be out on a quest to purchase these same items (as shown on these DVDs) after viewing these programmes! (certainly - for me - many of the `best' positions / variations presented on these two DVD programmes involve the use of the `Coffee Table' and / or the `Chair').

Accepting these DVD programmes for what they are and for what you are likely to achieve by owning, viewing, and learning form them; I can honestly recommend these as about the `best' of their type I have seen to date. These will definatley nOT be going back! - they are not only staying in our collection; but are now (quite frequently) played and studied (for both further general 'inspiration' - and also to polish up on our 'technique'!).

These DVDs are offered at a reasonable price, they are well made (filming, editing, and production values are high, these are tasteful - yet incisive), and they will - I am sure - bring something (if only a little) `new' and worthwhile to all - but the most wildly extrovert and physically insatiable - of loving couples (who have probably done ALL there is physically possible to do anyway).

Recommended to all typical, average, normal, and physically fitness-challenged loving couples out there - and may your physical love making find a little more `spice' as a result!",1142553600,88,6191,4.867996201329535

This DVD as well as the Seductive Sex Positions DVD are MUST BUYS for anyone in a relationship.",1141344000,43,2231,4.530612244897959
2201488,4,B00076QNZS,"My favorites are the Reverse Cowgirl, lying opposite / face down, Seated Queen, and my most favorite - 69. You should buy this.",1139011200,13,127,4.565217391304348
2201489,5,B00076QNZS,"At first I was a little skeptical buying a video that deals with sex education.  Since I am not too experienced in the bedroom I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was looking to try something different and wanted to explore new positions and techniques.  Most of all, I wanted to be able to please my partner in the bedroom.

This DVD made learning new sex positions fun and exciting.  First we watched the DVD in ""Instructional Mode"".  This play mode shows the positions while the hosts talk in the background about what males and females can do to make the experience better.  It didn't take long for us to get into the mood.

On a different day we watched the DVD in ""Lovemaking Mode"".  This showed the video in a whole new light.  There were no hosts talking and just had the music playing in the background.  In no time both me and my partner were right in there trying out the new positions playing on the TV.  This play mode will get both you and your partner's hearts racing.

The ""Random Mode"" is perfect for those nights where you feel like seeing if you know the positions.  We let it run in the background, trying to mimic what is showing.  It is more like a game than anything else.  This mode is definitely a welcomed addition to the DVD.

These three play modes and the quality of the DVD are what makes this feature stand out.  The hosts were very personable and the information they provided contained no clinical mumbo jumbo, just useful information for both males and females.  Another major plus is how each of the 27 positions are set in a black background so you can concentrate on how each of the positions are done.

Overall what this video has done as increased the communication lines between my partner and I as well as made sex fun and exciting.  If you are looking to try some new positions, have some fun with your partner, or even pick up a few new techniques, this is the DVD to buy.",1137283200,26,1912,4.375
2201490,4,B00076QNZS,I received this DVD as a gift for Christmas and I must say that it is a perfect gift for any couple who is looking to add something new to their sex life.  There are some great positions to try though some of them are a little harder to do than others.  I am eagerly waiting to see what you have in store for us in Erotic Sex Positions.  Kudos!!!,1136160000,3,346,3.914285714285714
2201491,1,B00076QNZS,"I'm not sure what my husband and I expected.  Maybe some instruction on new techniques, maybe something new and different for an already stimulating and sexually active marriage. Maybe something that would show us new and different ways to stimulate each other. Love making is fun and should be exciting, but this video really was boring - unfortunately.  We really hated to spend this much money and be so disappointed.

We have 2 teenaged daughters and I would genuinely hate for them to see a video like this and think sex is supposed to be like this. I've told them how love should be - they know that love between a man and woman should be tender, loving, but exciting enough to keep a couple interested for years and years.

Making love should be an ""experience"", and if it's not find new ways to make it exciting. The people should be touching, kissing, holding one another - whispering loving things to each other, carressing one another. Not rocking back and forth at the same pace all the time - that's really sad and frightening to be honest. Tell these couples about Tantric love making for goodness sake - I'd rather be a spider and get eaten than have to endure too many nights of what's on this video! I hope it's just for display.

What we got on the video was three different couples in 32 different positions for sex, which would've been fine if:  they actually seemed to be enjoying themselves, there was any stimulation other than the man's penis going in and out of the woman's body at one pace the entire video, there was any reason given for the benefit of any of the positions.  It just looked like, ""Oh gee how can we contort ourselves into one more position...oh yeah can you move your foot just a little to the left darling - maybe an inch or two.""

This DVD wasn't helpful because:
*If you wanted to try one of these positions and you didn't know how to configure your bodies to achieve the position, good luck! There was no instruction whatsoever.  What you saw, once the scene faded in, were the couples already in the position, having sex at the same rate every time, rarely stimulating each other in any other way than insert ""tab A"" into ""slot B"" at ""this rate"".
*The couples had very little expression. Remember ""Stepford Wives""? Same expressions - poor dears!
*Other than the man rocking back and forth, back and forth, back and forth at the same pace...there was very little stimulation - the women seemed like they were just basically recepticles - there was very little stimulation of the breasts, no stimulation of the clitoris, and in some of the positions the men didn't even touch the women with their hands! I can't imagine being made love to in that manner.

My husband and I have MUCH more exciting love making than this on a regular basis. If our bodies looked like the ones in the videos we could make a killing, and this is actually what people think is exciting.

Touch each other, taste each other, elevate the experience, communicate, express yourselves, try new and stimulating things, make love into an experience, try tantra, listen to CD's by Osho, and don't bother with this DVD!  There are plenty of beautiful and or erotic books out there - try one of those.",1135728000,112,3216,4.583623693379791

I picked up ""Seductive Sex Positions"" with moderate expectations. So many of these videos are cheaply done, with little thought to audience comfort level and quality. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised at the time and effort put into this production. The video is hosted by attractive ladies who provide the introduction and instruction for each of the 27 positions presented. Cheesy plots are kept to a minimum, and the actors in the video are attractive, but not plastic: they aren't obviously surgically enhanced or airbrushed to the point where they don't look real. They are in good shape, but they don't look like porn stars. In fact, they do seem like loving couples (and by that, I don't mean ugly and amateur), whether that is because they are in great relationships or are just good actors.

This video is not only a high-quality production, it seems to be a project that they took pains to make accessible to couples-as in both men and women. The focus is on sensual touching and intimacy as well as the varied positions. The positions explored are non-threatening but interesting variations on conventional positions (man on top, woman on top, side-by-side, seated and rear entry). The music is soothing and sensual, but there is no sound coming from the actors. This can be good in terms of reducing the ""porn"" effect of the video, but may disappoint those who are turned on by audio.

The ""extras"" section of the video is also well thought out: couples have the option of turning the instructional track on or off, activating the ""Lovemaking"" mode for visual background stimulation. Also, if you are looking to mix up the positions once you are familiar with them, you can throw on the randomizer and see if you can keep up!

Both Seductive Sex Positions and Erotic Sex Positions (released a year later) are great videos for couples who are not into porn, but who are excited about exploring their sexuality and experimenting with pleasuring each other. I would definitely recommend them both There really is no other product on the market (DVD or tape) that compares.",1124150400,,2104,4.81994459833795
2201495,4,B00076QNZS,The video was very tasteful and professional.  The approach of the DVD was very straight forward and not clinical like most sex education shows on TV or Video.  I found this to be very appealing.  Both me and my wife enjoyed it very much.,1123891200,9,238,4.363636363636363
2201496,5,B00076QNZS,"Purchased the positions video from their website (a trailer is on the website if you want to preview the DVD) and must say that it was very nicely done. High quality production in every way. Sensual yet not overly explicit, informative without being clinical as most others of its kind. The approach in its presentation was welcome. Specifically the dark background to further accentuate the action was quite good. If there is a complaint to be made, I would say that it wasn't explcit enough. More revealing camera angles and shots would have been a welcome addition to the video. As a last comment, the women were of stunning good looks, Kate Wynter in particular. Undoubtedly I'm not alone in wanting to see her included in future projects. Much success.",1123891200,9,757,4.8307692307692305
2201497,5,B00076QNZS,"In my opinion, the material in this video is made for couples. When watched together the video can help intiate conversations about what men and women enjoy during sex. The couples were attractive and portrayed each of the 27 positions on a black background which emphasises each of them as well as what can be done to enhance each of them.

The three play modes are a great feature for a sex education DVD. My partner and I enjoy both the lovemaking mode and random mode.

What I love about this video is that it was made for both sexes. It filmed in an erotic manner for both males and females. Usually when you watch any time of adult video it is geared towards the males out there, but this DVD is great for males, females, or couples.",1123718400,10,739,4.3478260869565215
2201498,5,B00076QNZS,"Overall this DVD is great. It is filmed in such a way that allows you to watch it alone or with your partner and unlike other instructional DVDs, it adds two extra playback features which in my mind make the DVD worth the money: Lovemaking Mode and Random Mode.

Lovemaking Mode allows you to watch the DVD with your partner from start to finish with so sensual mood music in the background and no instruction from the hosts.

Random Mode lets the DVD player pick a position from their set of 27 and then plays it for a couple minutes. Once the position plays, it selects another random position.",1123718400,3,596,4.458715596330276
2201499,5,B00076QNZS,"I bought this DVD as a present for my girlfriend.  If you want instant sex position info this is the DVD to get. The foreplay scenes are stimulating for both males and females, there are some new positions that I seen as well as some challenging ones. Best of all the love making mode and random mode are great for couples.

I do own some sex position books but a video just shows you how to do it the way its supposed to be done.",1123718400,8,430,4.047058823529412

8045081,4,B00076QNZS,"This isn't a clothes on sort of example.  They are of course naked, and very much ""doing it"".  It isn't raunchy but there is nothing left to imagine, they show everything, sometimes up close.  Honestly, its a good thing.  There are some books/videos that try to make do and fall short.  They do explain technicality, they explain technique, they explain who feels what, where, and why.  There are a few ""advanced"" positions for those who are limber or um ""gifted"" enough, but otherwise is for the average couple looking for something new.  Been a while since I seen it but there is no fluid exchange (understand where I going with this?) and they portrait the female as an equal as much as she should be.  Actually I think they focus on lifting her up and giving her more focus, which is good for everyone right?  For what it is, its tasteful.

I like the random positions option the best.",1354060800,2,889,4.534591194968553
