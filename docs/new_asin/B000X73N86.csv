Here, we have Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Land and Mudslides, Ice Storms as seen by the media, and the events are described, mostly by those who lived through them. If one is interested in disasters or weather, this showcases some of the worst of the moment as these things are explained in detail as to how they happened.",1393632000,,443,4.6923076923076925

These weather events obviously have profound effects on people.  That is the true heart of these dvds.  The raw power of nature is awesome to behold, but the ability of people to cope with these events is also pretty awesome.  No matter how hard nature hits people, they manage to rebuild their lives in the midst of tragic circunstances.  The human spirit is the true meaning of these stories, and how it endures difficult situations.  JRV",1366070400,2,592,4.580952380952381

Product also comes with a 28 page booklet giving bios on TWC Storm Team meteorologists as well as different types of severe weather.

Now, for the stories themselves.  Each ""story"" is about 25 minutes long and talks about different experiences involving fatal storms.  It covers a lot of what was put on The Weather Channel through 2006 or so.  It's quite informative and entertaining, though TWC seems to have a heavy hand with emotional impact on families.  Lots of twisters and hurricanes with some floods, landslides, etc., but not as much footage of the storms themselves as I was hoping.

As for the product, be warned.  This is a Madacy product.  I picked it up because, with the price, you can't really go wrong.  But the video is not the greatest, which took me back to the VCR days.  Still, that can be overlooked, but the sound was quite awful in many spots.  Nothing like hearing a Jim Cantore-sounding kazoo.  Still, they do give you direct scene access, which not all Madacy product does.  They rate it as ""G"", but parents, bear in mind that though not on screen, family deaths do occur, and the survivors do talk about it.

For 10+ hrs of storm coverage for the price, it's worth the disc issues, but not by much.  3.5 stars.",1300752000,11,1886,4.792569659442725
2998744,5,B000X73N86,I bought this DVD set for my ten year old who loves this The Weather Channel series.

8227138,4,B000X73N86,"I bought this set as slightly used, but in great condition.  So far, only one episode had some scratchiness in the background, but it did not last throughout the story - only once in awhile, and not that distracting.  There are 5 DVD's with 5 episodes on each.  The variety is good, but most of them are about tornadoes, which I personally like best.  So if tornadoes aren't your thing, you may want to stick with purchasing the individual Storm Stories DVD's that deal only with floods or hurricanes.",1524355200,,501,4.595505617977528
