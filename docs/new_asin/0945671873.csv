172269,4,0945671873,This video is a nice introduction to yoga in a wonderful setting with a relaxing instructor. Easy to follow,1180396800,,107,4.684210526315789
172270,5,0945671873,"I have used this every other morning for 2 years, it is a great way to start the day. I am 61.",1168300800,,94,3.3181818181818183
172271,5,0945671873,"AM Yoga provides a practice so gentle that I've frequently performed it upon first waking up and while still in my pajamas.  It begins with a 4-minute, simple breathing exercise which helps your mind to focus, and then the basic twists and other postures which follow help your body to awaken. The practice is led by Rodney Yee, an excellent instructor who provides flawless cuing and who has an extremely calm, soothing voice--ideal for anyone who is not a morning person! The total time is about 16 minutes, making it ideal to fit in at virtually any time of day.

Although the program is very doable for those new to yoga, it does assume some prior familiarity with the poses (total yoga newbies will find Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Beginners to be an excellent way to learn the postures).  I now consider myself to be at an intermediate level, but I still turn to this video frequently when I want a short, gentle practice; highly recommended.",1116460800,3,953,4.6946107784431135
172272,5,0945671873,"I have tried other yoga tapes in the past and did not like them.  Rodney Yee makes it so easy.  This is an excellent tape for beginners.  I put in the tape when I get up in the morning and have a very gentle workout before I start my day.  If you are looking for stretching exercises, easy instructions, and something short (only takes about 20 minutes), this tape is for you.  I also have Rodney's back and abs tapes.  They are great as well.",1105660800,5,443,4.152941176470589
172273,5,0945671873,"This yoga tape is much better than other ones rated highly on Amazon.  I felt relaxed, calm and happy after doing this tape, although I am a high-strung person.  It is not much of a work out, but there are a lot of stretches and a lot of meditation.  I would definitely recommend it.  Also, I think that this tape is very good for beginners.  This tape is not strenuous, nor are the moves difficult.  It might also hold something for the more advanced yoga students because the meditation piece of it is so well done.  Just remember that this tape is short, only 20 minutes.",1076198400,3,574,4.3584905660377355
172274,5,0945671873,"This tape is much akin to a great morning stretching program for your muscle groups, rather than a true workout.  Truly low, low impact.  The different forms, the pacing of the forms, and the music make this the perfect way to begin the day.  The forms are not difficult to learn and breathing through each form is natural.  I find that I'm more centered, alert, and relaxed.
I also recommend getting the music for the video.  Peter Davison's Adagio: Music for T'ai Chi.  After practicing with the video, you want to just practice the forms to the music alone.",1047513600,6,560,4.606060606060606
172275,5,0945671873,"I recently started exercising religiously and found that my muscles (and entire body) were sore and stiff in the morning.  This is the perfect way to get a deep stretch in the morning as well as calm your mind and body in preparation for the upcoming day.  Before using this tape, I was always tired in the mornings, but now I feel ready to meet the day with a smile.  I love feeling this way (even if if does cause annoyance to the people around me!)  I think that everyone needs to take some special time for themselves each day.  What better time than first thing in the morning?
The tape itself is extremely well-done.  David-Dorian Ross has a calming voice, the scenery is beautiful and the music sets a great tone.  I think that these exercises are accessible to anyone and very easy to do.  Their effect is enormous.
One note:  do not purchase this tape thinking that you are going to get a cardio workout.  The purpose of this tape is to leave you mentally and physically energized all day and is an excellent supplement to an exercise routine.",1030060800,12,1052,4.460732984293194
172276,5,0945671873,"This is a great video for people on the go.  The tape is approximately 15 minutes and easy to incorporate in your daily routine.  ""A.M. Yoga"" offers a very basic and relaxing yoga routine. The beautiful scenery, voice-over, and music will calm your mind, while the gentle stretching poses will relax your body. Rodney Yee's yoga routine mainly consists of seated positions and hamstring stretches.  Please be advised that he uses a yoga strap for the hamstring/leg stretches, but a piece of fabric or belt could work as a substitute.  There is also a nice, relaxing meditation at the close of the routine--which could easily put one to sleep.  =)  My only complaint is that he does NOT hold the poses very long for a thorough stretch and the routine does seem a bit rushed.  In a yoga class, you would normally hold a pose for 2-3 minutes.
I found the routine straightforward and easy to integrate in my hectic daily schedule.  After using the video, I always feel energized and ready to take on the day!!!  After three weeks of practicing this routine, I NOW feel motivated to continue exercising and to seek a more advanced fitness routine.  For me, this video was the perfect starting-place!!  I would recommend A.M. Yoga for *beginners* and those who just want a quick stretch.",1023321600,12,1281,4.725225225225225
172277,1,0945671873,"I have put this off too long. And I'm sorry to shout, folks, and I rarely, if ever, use all caps to so so on the internet, but THIS YOGA VIDEO IS NOT AT ALL FOR BEGINNERS!  Do yourself a favor and read the review of April 5, 2000-keeping in mind that even if you are familiar with yoga from a class, this video is NO substitute.  Inexperienced at yoga, I bought this video a few years ago, and wound up immediately searching for and finding much more helpful, effective and properly instructed beginner's yoga videos, such as: Kripalu Beginner and Kripalu Gentle, Yoga Zone For Beginners, and, yes, Jane Fonda's.  Try one or all of those videos, and after you have learned the things you need to know to ENJOY and benefit from yoga, you can use Mr. Yee's videos for quick and refreshing yoga workouts when you are particularly pressed for time.  I'm sure Mr. Yee must be a very good yoga teacher in person, but he really cut corners in his videos, and if you are able to compare his videos with one or more of the videos mentioned above, you will surely see what I mean. In this video, and at least one of his other ones, I am sorry to say, he's basically on display with very little instruction.",1020384000,8,1196,4.325892857142857
172278,5,0945671873,"This purchase was my first introduction to yoga. The setting and music are beautiful. Rodney Yee provides clear, detailed instructions to carefully lead you through the exercises. Every time I complete this video I feel refreshed and limber. It is perfect for the beginner. Enjoy!",1008201600,3,280,5.2444444444444445
172279,5,0945671873,"*THE INSTRUCTOR: David Dorian Ross is a fantastic instructor! He is very calm, focused and uses perfect form. His soothing voice and pleasant and attractive appearance make this video all the more enjoyable for anyone.
*THE WORKOUT: To me, it isn't as much a physical workout as it is a Meditative, Cleansing, Balancing, Special time I look forward to doing first thing in the morning. I feel the moves physically and mentally. It is wonderful, I'm telling you!
**THE SCENERY AND MUSIC: Top Knotch. David's soothing voice along with the incredibly beautiful Hawaiian waters, breathtaking sky and lovely beach transports me there with him. The music is a soft, slow Chinese and the waves are also crashing so those alone add so much to this video!
*THE MOVES: Simplicity at it's finest but in no means boring. David explains what each movement does for you and gives you things to imagine as you are doing the movements. I love this-great for visualization and insures proper alignment, breathing and form.
*THE FEELING AFTERWARDS: I feel like a million bucks! Relaxed, calm, focused, centered. My mind and body are balanced together. I wish I felt this way all the time! As I continue to do this daily and advance, I know I will feel it more and more. It truly is a cleansing of your mind, body and spirit. It opens the heart so that you are ready to face the day's events with a joyful and peaceful heart. Try it! You don't have to break a sweat to feel fantastic! And just 20 minutes! Yes! You won't believe how great you'll feel!",1003795200,15,1532,4.656826568265683
172280,4,0945671873,"This am yoga tape, starring Rodney Yee, is a real joy.  It is very easy to follow for a beginner.  It makes you feel peaceful and focused.  I bought both the am and pm yoga tapes, but find that I only use the am tape - even at night.  It is good for relaxation anytime.  I found some of the poses on the pm tape a bit challenging, but still reasonable for a beginner.  My one complaint about this tape (and reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that there is not enough time for relaxed meditation afterwards.  I wish there were more music and ocean waves to meditate to instead of Yoga Journal commercials.",993427200,18,605,4.163793103448276
172281,4,0945671873,"I am going through chemotherapy for the second time.  This tape gives me mental discipline, relaxation, and helps me to start my day. The background music and scenery is outstanding.",962236800,6,182,5.066666666666666
172282,5,0945671873,"I am a regular with yoga, I go to yoga class 2-3 times a week, as well as practice on my own and with various tapes. This is a very short and easy tape, so don't buy it if you're looking for something vigorous or if you  want to be a pretzle. This video helps to calm the mind, I like to use it  in the morning before going off to work, but more often I use it when  returning home, or in the middle of the day when I feel stressed and just  need some calming. I bought this as a set with the P.M. tape, and I  actually prefer to use the A.M. tape in the evening over the designated  P.M. tape.  The fact that all the tapes in this series are filmed in the  beautiful Hawaiin islands with absolutely superb camera angles and talented  camera person, certainly adds to the enjoyment of the tapes. I usually do  yoga with eyes closed for a more intense mental workout for balance, but  when I open them and see the ocean waves and virgin beaches, it takes me  right back to that aloha spirit I love. Namaste Rodney , and Pactricia  Walden! Also if you have someone to practice with, check out the yoga for  partners tape with Rodney Yee and his wife.",958348800,42,1148,4.089686098654709
172283,4,0945671873,"A.M. Yoga provides a peaceful and relaxing routine to start your day.  The beautiful setting, soothing narration, and quiet music enhance relaxation while the gentle movements and stretches limber the body.  Most of this  easy routine involves seated or supine positions, with nothing more  ""strenuous"" than the downward dog pose and supine hamstring stretch, so if  you are looking for a more advanced morning yoga program, you would be  happier with a different video.  Also, be aware that you will spend only 12  minutes actually moving, with the other five divided between conscious  relaxation and guided meditation (the video clocked in at 17 minutes rather  than the 20 claimed in advertising).  This brevity is perfect for busy  schedules, but an extended version for those of us with more time would  have been a worthwhile addition.  Finally, although the title says ""A.M.,""  this video would be appropriate any time of the day you need to relax.",955152000,61,956,5.077419354838709
172284,2,0945671873,"For someone who's never done yoga - especially never with a yoga instructor - it's probably an ok video.  However, if you have been taking classes you will be disappointed.  He whips through the poses much too  quickly - by the time I felt I was in the pose properly he was two poses  ahead of me.  He does not explain how to properly position yourself in the  pose, just sort of glosses over what the pose looks like.  I've taken a  seminar from from Rodney Yee before, and this video is nothing like what he  teaches in a classroom environment.",954892800,7,546,4.326732673267327
172285,5,0945671873,"I saw the preview on one of your morning shows, as he gave an instructional lesson.  Boy, I never knew tai chi was so simple!  I've always seen people practicing tai and thought, ""Oh, what a bunch of  wierd-doe's!""  Now, I know what it did for me on that one morning and  the feeling of rejuvenation, it was great!  Now I want to share it with  everyone!  I'm buying the video to share with my family and making it a  morning ritual before we begin our day!",950400000,8,457,4.160919540229885
172286,4,0945671873,I have it and have been using it almost daily for 7 months now.  It is still usable but just a beginning.  You will want to know more; to continue to learn.  However these same movements can be studied for life and still  be beneficial. Give it a try.  It's only ten bucks!,949708800,2,273,4.0754716981132075
172287,5,0945671873,"I  bought this  video about 3 weeks ago.  I didn't know much about chi before this video.  In the beginning I focused more on watching David in the video to make sure I was doing it right, after a while I focused on my  mind and body.  This is an excellent video that has changed the way I start  out my day.  The scenery is beautiful and you feel like you are right  there. I highly recommend this video, it's simple to do but not so simple  that you master the moves, this will probably take years.  the best part of  this video is that you can complete it in 20 minutes.  I look forward to  getting up in the morning and starting out my day with a.m. chi.  Try it!  You'll love it.",945648000,5,684,3.9925373134328357
172288,4,0945671873,I think this tape is fine for beginners. The pace is slow and the instructor doesn't try to cram a lot of poses into 20 min. There are decent segments on meditation and relaxation at the beginning and end (which I  think are good to introduce folks to). I feel the PM tape is better -- a  bit slower paced & stretches you more.,945216000,3,327,4.09375

I missed the old one, but could not find it. Someone suggested that I look on Amazon and there it was. I am very happy to find it again.",1395878400,,290,3.7704918032786887

7793567,5,0945671873,"I already have one that I use at work with the residents. We have completed the program and we are happy of the result. So much, that I purchase one for myself. Unfortunately I have played it yet so I hope the condition is good. Overall this is a great video for someone new at chi exercises. I  would recommend it was well put together and you feel so good all over. The end of our exercise we always feel calm and refreshed.",1368144000,,426,4.132530120481928

7793571,5,0945671873,"This is a great place for beginners to start. This tape starts you out slowly and helps you build the routine at your own pace. Very soothing music and tranquil setting. I was a little intimidated to try yoga at first but this tape walks you through slowly so you are able to keep up.  If you are at all nervous or intimidated by trying yoga, I would recommend this.",1317859200,,366,4.228571428571429
