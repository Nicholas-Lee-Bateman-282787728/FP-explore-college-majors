7996542,5,B0000A9GIE,This is a really fun trip through Pennsylvania's diners and other eateries.,1403913600,,75,5.333333333333333
7996543,5,B0000A9GIE,I am a diner buff and this video is so much fun and very informative about Pennsylvania diners.  It covers every area of the state and goes from interviews with owners to customers to digging up history about the buildings and folks who own them and frequent them.,1356566400,,264,4.5
7996544,5,B0000A9GIE,"We recently saw the special, Pennsylvania Diners and other Roadside Restaurants on a PBS special. The timing was perfect! Christmas was coming and I needed a unique gift for my brother-in-law (who is from Pennsylvania). He love it! And, of course, he had stories to share about other places in Pennsylvania. A great find at the right time!",1295568000,,339,4.862068965517241
7996545,5,B0000A9GIE,"The places in this documentary are pure PA kitch, especially if you grew up in rural PA in the early 90's.",1246060800,,106,4.095238095238095
7996546,5,B0000A9GIE,"Just updated my video format this time.  I've owned the VHS version of this video for years and it's one of my favorites.  But I decided to update to DVD because the VHS tape is wearing out!  See my review on the VHS format...my opinion hasn't changed.  This is one of my all-time favorite documentaries.  Still fun to watch!  And it is still one of Rick Sebak's best...fun, fun, fun!",1244937600,2,384,4.414285714285715
7996547,5,B0000A9GIE,"I have owned this video since it was available and it is one of my favorite .  I have played it so many times, I'm almost due for a new one.  The subject just seems to take me back to my childhood of neighborhood grocerys, milk men and of course, mom and pop restaurants.  Rick Sebak's easy narration style adds the right touch, making the whole documentary feel not so documentary-like.  The soundtrack helps to enhance the old time feel of the subject.  This video is a must for any diner buff or anyone that likes nostalgic trips back to a simpler time.",1166313600,5,556,4.359223300970874
7996548,5,B0000A9GIE,"I've owned the VHS version of this PBS show since it first aired back in 1993 and have watched it regularly since.

I am a diner enthusiast and thank God for Rick Sebak (who sucessfully narrates too). He has captured a piece of Americana that is being long forgotten in the wake of corporate fast-food chain expansions that have the personality and taste of an unlit cigarette.

Once you watch this program, you will want to visit one of these unique and valuable family restaurants for yourself. Good, because they must be preserved.

Remember, before there were the megla-corporate food chains, there were the hamburger stands and diners. They all began in these humble beginnings. Rick Sebak has done a another fantastic job!",1141776000,4,728,4.902439024390244
7996549,4,B0000A9GIE,"Growing up in Pennsylvania, I remember the diner as an institution.  Now, years later, this video brings back the memories of the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes that are unique to the diner experience.  It does a good job of capturing the variety of diners within Pennsylvania, and includes the more noteworthy ones such as the Downingtown, Melrose, Midway, and others.  While it tends to jump around and it tries to do too much in too little time (I would have liked to see more of some and included 1-2 less diners, for example), it is a fine production overall.  Watching this video always puts a smile on my face.",1110412800,4,621,4.618181818181818
