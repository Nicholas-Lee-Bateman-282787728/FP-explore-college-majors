7713180,5,B01DJEAFNA,"Very well done. I have read about Adam Smith's works, but this video gives me a lot more context of his relevancy in today's world and how his ideas were used in the 1770s by the Founding Fathers.

It's too bad that public schools do not emphasis his ideas and what he stood for instead of promulgating the ""virtues"" of big government.",1465776000,2,335,4.403225806451613

7713182,4,B01DJEAFNA,"This is a very well-produced and informative DVD about the man Adam Smith and his ideals. The presenter does a rather commendable job of presenting both to the viewer as well as the books Adam Smith wrote and the times he lived in. I was surprised at how well the videos were produced and the amount of information they contained. However, the one thing I find irritating is when it takes a swipe at Christianity. If you can overlook this example of extremely poor judgment then this DVD should not fail to impress.",1462924800,2,515,4.548387096774194
8756025,5,B01DJEAFNA,"Brilliantly insightful first episode, followed by an encomium on globalization in the follow-up!

Second episode would have benefited from at least mention of the way 'TBTF' & Fed interventions since 08/09 have introduced a toxic moral hazard (the Fed 'put') and how 'un-Smithian' the US economy/market/regulatory environment is today; it's like the East India company has reincarnated in American banking, health care, the MIC etc.

A third episode helping us understand how Keynesianism, the New Deal etc messes with Smith's notions would have been useful too.",1522195200,,562,5.523255813953488
8756026,2,B01DJEAFNA,"It is an advertisement for big business, nothing more.  I laughed during the segment on Whole Foods - which has been swallowed up by Amazon after having a marked decline for a couple of years.  The problem with the politicians who invoke Adam Smith's name while selling their economic policies is that Smith also asserted strongly that for capitalism to succeed, there would need to be always a certain % of unemployment, and those unemployed needed to be provided for.  America certainly does a lousy job of that.",1517443200,,514,4.818181818181818
8756027,5,B01DJEAFNA,Very pleased with this production. All those interested in history and/or economics should try to watch this at least once.,1494374400,,123,5.2
8756028,5,B01DJEAFNA,"This is amazing, and we've watched it multiple times, with different people. Excellent food for thought.",1477440000,,104,5.5625
8756029,5,B01DJEAFNA,I found it to be thorough.,1473897600,,26,3.5
8756030,5,B01DJEAFNA,Great ideas conveyed through an excellent film of only 57 min.  Great photography and excellent audio.  But the ideas of Adam Smith are the most important and crystal clear message of this production.  Every voter in this country should see it and understand how far we  have gone astray from the path that made America the greatest country in the world.,1470873600,,354,4.754098360655738
