And of course, in true PBS style, it's fantastically interesting with outstanding footage, killer interviews, and lots of neat facts.  While we watched it we were constantly on our phones looking up the stars (are they still alive? when did they die? etc.) - so our experience was practically interactive. Love it. :) Will be using this in my mass media class - who knew classroom materials could be such a guilty pleasure!",1359072000,,517,4.7444444444444445

This DVD explains a lot of stuff I could never have figured out on my own.  ""Family secrets"", explained 30 years later.

These actors, shown in color and black & white clips, never seem to get any older.  Their faces are so familiar.  It's kind of freaky to realize that none of them have the slightest idea who I am.",1207785600,8,473,4.2

8228057,5,B000XCZGWC,"This is not history for me, rather many of these programs were what I watched when I was a kid.  There are four roughly one hour programs.  There is a narrative line for each program.  There are many excerpts.  Given the age of the programs and how they were preserved the image quality is excellent.  It was great to relive many of these and the DVD will prove interesting for those with an interest in televison history.",1387065600,,422,4.428571428571429
