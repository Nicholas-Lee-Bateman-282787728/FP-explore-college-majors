3169171,5,B001781JRW,"I was thrilled to find that this film was finally released on DVD. For years, it was my favorite film that I had on VHS. This independent film was shot on a small budget and it shows. But, if you overlook the limitations on the film maker, the plot is so moving and at times cathartic that I often wished I could offer the filmmaker a big budget to reshoot the film. With a bigger budget, the cinematography could have improved. If they had not been limited to a small camera in mostly small apartments for major scenes, a better camera with sets would have improved the appearance. If more money had been available, the soundtrack and score could have been better. But the film maker probably used unknown composers and performers that he knew to provide the soundtrack. The script could use some more work with consultation with a professional. The acting could have been more professional, but the film maker probably cast unknown friends in the rolls. But, when I found that it had a delayed DVD release, it was for me confirmation that I was not the only person who loved this independent film enough to constantly ask for a DVD release. I want to avoid spoilers. But, the two protogonists can be described enough to grab the attention of two potential audiences: Jews and gays. The story begins with the character Emanuel, who is a young orthodox Jew living in Brooklyn with his family. He is forced into an introspective crisis when his parents arrange a marriage with a woman for whom he is merely a past acquaintance. He has a relative (the relationship is not clear) who is a distant cousin. This is our second protagonist, Shai. Shai has left the orthodox community in Brooklyn and assimilated into the gay culture in Manhattan. When Emanuel is struggling with his feelings about the arranged marriage he does not want, it is his cousin Shai to whom he turns for a sympathetic ear. The theme of the film is the reconciliation of being Jewish and being gay. Are they going to be gays who happen to be Jewish? Or, are they going to be Jews who happen to be gay? If you watch this film only once and do not look past the film's flaws caused by a low budget, you may miss the depth of the plot and the significant character development of both Emanuel and Shai. But, if you watch it more than once, and overlook the film's minor flaws, you are drawn into the very real question raised on identity: to be a gay man who happens to be Jewish or to be a Jewish man who happens to be gay. As the film progresses, both Emanuel and Shai learn from each other and both change their views on identity. Both move from polar opposites to a new middle ground that integrates both their Jewish faith and their gay sexuality in a brave, new way that honors both without diminishing the other. As a Jewish, gay man this film greatly impacted how I identified myself. The film presents an alternative to conventional polar positions and offers a compromise of how the two can find a common ground not normally considered. It is a thoughtful, deep plot which due to budget can be missed by the casual viewers. But if you watch this film with an open mind, you can easily be drawn into the plot's thesis of identity, reconciling being Jewish and gay.",1323907200,3,3239,4.500848896434635
3169172,1,B001781JRW,"I really wanted to like this one going into it but unfortunately it didn't turn out that way.  The idea was a good one.  It sounded like it might be a sort of ""Eyes Wide Open"" story.  (I loved that one!).  Oh, I have to admit I didn't finish watching it, so I suppose it might have been better if I had stuck with it.  But I only lasted about twenty minutes before I gave up.  Poor production values are not unexpected in indie films, so that wasn't the real problem.  Bad direct-to-video cinematography doesn't really matter either, if that's all the director can afford.  But there is no excuse for bad writing and terrible acting, and that's what this one had in abundance.

The lead actors are both completely unattractive, and I don't mean physically.  That isn't important.  In fact, it's nice to see stories about ordinary looking guys for a change.  But these two aren't particularly likeable.  The out and proud (sort of) guy, Charlie (by all means let's change our name so that no one knows we're Jewish) is shallow and intolerant (he seems to have rejected his family for their way of life as much as they seem to have rejected him because of his); the conflicted one, (Moshe) is whiny and neurotic.  These two sound like a couple of guys who strayed in from a Woody Allen film, except they can't act.

The best line comes from the Charlie's roommate, who says, ""I didn't know he was Jewish (pause) that's a shame.""  What is that all about?  Is it a shame Charlie is Jewish, or that Charlie was unwilling to tell them he was Jewish, or that Charlie doesn't want to spend time with his family?  I hope it was the last one, but it was a little unclear.

Anyway, I suppose I shouldn't judge a movie by the first twenty minutes.  Maybe things got better along the way.  But I couldn't see spending another hour and twenty minutes with these people.",1312502400,,1855,4.445103857566766
3169173,4,B001781JRW,"After seing the movie, I, an Independent Catholic Bishop, want to keep a traditional home.  The bad: the fellow who played the father over-acted and came across more like an Italian father than a Jewish one. Neil Diamond whould have been great for the part.  Otherwise, I feel the movie is excellent.  It is a great example of the trama a closeted member of a tradition family experiences and the pain of coming out in that environment.  As a love story, it is absolutely delightful. The romance, tenderness, and growing love between the two young men is wonderful and the ""sexual"" scenes are done so tastefully that they simply enhance the romance.  I understand more now about Jewish traditions and frequently went on-line and to my library to learn more. Finally, the video shows how you can keep very old cultural traditions and still maintain your love and identity as a gay may. I even asked my husband if we can keep a kosher home and celebrate sabat.",1294876800,,958,4.678571428571429

The best, and most believable performances are delivered by the broken fiancee and the two brothers.

3169187,4,B001781JRW,"""Next Year in Jerusalem"" is a story about self-acceptance, self-love, and coming out for a Jewish man, Manny.  His family has already arranged his marriage to a ""nice, Jewish girl,"" however, there's just one BIG problem--Manny is gay.  He is laboring a great deal with his own acceptance.  It seems his parents are not any different that a lot of parents:  they are not tolerant of this type of lifestyle.

Enter Manny's cousin, Charlie, who, according to his family, has ""turned his back on his religion.""  The cousin changed his name from Shai to Charlie.  He misses High Holy Days because he just doesn't believe his personal life should be ruled by out-dated simplistic religious interpretations.  Manny confides in Charlie, and Charlie (who lives in the West Village of NYC) introduces him to the new lifestyle.  In particularly enjoyed this part of the film, because Manny really did seemed awed and surprised at every little thing.  Charlie's friends were very accepting and helpful in helping Manny feel at home with his new family.

""New Year in Jerusalem"" is not the best gay-themed movie I've seen, but it surely isn't close to being the worst, either.  The guy who played Manny did get on my nerves a little because he whined way too much, and it seemed his reactions to lines were a second or two behind what they should have been--like he was trying to remember his lines.  What was even more enjoying for me was seeing Georgianna Spelvin playing Charlie's mother.  Georgianna got her start in the porn business, but I ALWAYS enjoyed her acting because she displayed a great sense of humor.  She was very sweet in her portrayal of Shai's mom.  The ending at least leaves you with hope that things can work out, if you set your mind to it and you have the right support group!

Rated R for nudity and some language, I would recommend this one.",1339977600,,1856,4.696594427244582
