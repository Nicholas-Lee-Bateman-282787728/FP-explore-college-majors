3736489,5,B001OVFAA4,"I love this DVD.  It is really helping me to increases the energy flow in my body and has dramatically reduced the amount of stress in my life.  The segments are very well done, not choppy, and the music is very nice.  I have been doing this every day after work and I can as the segments last under an hour.  I would recommend this even to women who are not trying to conceive.  it serves as a wonderful awareness tool for the female body and relaxes you no matter what time of the month it is.",1278547200,10,495,4.061855670103093
3736490,5,B001OVFAA4,I believe this is working my periods are more predictable and I feel better about myself. I could not afford acupuncture so this was my only hope. I will keep you guys posted after my next cycle 7/10. Try it what do you have to lose. Oh yeah it is a basic setup on dvd no frills. However light some candles and they get you really going.,1274140800,,337,4.044776119402985
3736491,4,B001OVFAA4,"They have definatly included the right poses for each section of your cycle. The dvd was produced by a fertility clinic that uses Eastern and Western medicine, this is explained in the introduction. The music is a little annoying, I wish it were more yoga studioish. The sections last from 31-40 minutes and you should do it daily, seems resonable. The directions for each pose are complete and make sense, but they only speak in English, not using the Sanskrit name for poses. I generally like a little more ""spirtual granola yoga"" in my yoga...chanting, inspiration, ect. I think they tried to make the dvd for the masses, not people who have actually practiced yoga. Expect a restorative Hatha style class where you hold poses, not much flow. There are a lot of hip poses and floor work as I would expect in a restoring fertility dvd. I like that the classes are differnet for each phase of your cycle. As a woman dealing with infertility, I would have liked the dvd to have included more verbal focus on the spirtual aspect of trying to concieve, rather than simply going through the poses. Each of the three women in the dvd modify the poses diferently, so it is appropriate for any level of yogini.",1266969600,40,1204,4.630841121495327
3736492,5,B001OVFAA4,"I got this DVD as a gift and have found it to be really easy to follow (i'm new to yoga and wasn't sure if I could do the poses).

The packet comes with 4 sets, to coincide with each phase of a woman's cycle.
I'm not trying to get pregnant, but like most women, would like to regulate my hormones, especially during PMS, and I think this DVD is one way to help my body regulate itself - since it's designed to optimize a woman's hormonal system for the purpose of increasing fertility, it must help optimze your system overall.

What I like best is that the DVD was created by specialists who do yoga themselves, so they practice what they preach!",1264204800,5,647,4.252032520325203
3736493,4,B001OVFAA4,It's nice to have a different yoga routine for each phase of the cycle.  I wish they explained what each or most of the exercises was helping but it is a good dvd.,1257033600,2,163,3.9393939393939394
3736494,5,B001OVFAA4,"Drs. Horn and Yu have created a Yoga for Fertility DVD that surpasses anything I have seen before. This is a must have for couples who are faced with the daunting challenge of infertility.  Watching this DVD will nourish the soul, clear the mind and tone the body: all perfectly coordinated to present a balanced state which, in my profesional opinion will increase fertility outcomes.

I highly recommend this product.

3736495,5,B001OVFAA4,"This video sets the precedent for fertility yoga videos.  Its super useful and well-guided and spares the hoakey factor of other videos in this genre. The other outstanding part about the content is that it is designed by Brandon Horn and Wendy Yu, two of the most knowledgeable Chinese medicine practitioners working in the specialty field of infertility.  The postures are individualized based on the phase of your cycle which lends a supportive awareness and enhanced care to your pursuit of optimizing health and fertility, either on your own or in conjunction with any other treatments you might be pursuing.  Its fun to learn some acupressure points too!",1238371200,34,660,5.092592592592593
3736496,5,B001OVFAA4,"I have been on the fertility journey for some time, and this is a DVD that I would highly recommend. This DVD is very helpful in that it not only explains ""how"", it gives detailed information regarding ""why"". I am the type of person that enjoys learning the science behind something that I undertake, and this DVD provides that information without being too technical/beyond a lay-person's reach.

While I consider myself a fairly active person, yoga is not something that I would say comes naturally to me, and so I found it extremely helpful that, depending upon one's flexibility/ability, you are given options re: how to obtain/transition between the poses. And I must say, you will DEFINITELY feel the effects of the various poses and stretches! It is helpful to obtain a yoga mat/blocks and have a towel and pillow ready when you start, as noted in an earlier review.

One very beneficial thing that to note is that my body is definitely affected by conducting the poses on the DVD. I immediately noticed that my cycle has responded by becoming more regular and, interestingly, I have had the BEST sleep ever! I normally toss/turn during the night, but since I have started using the DVD I have had a very deep sleep without tossing/turning.

In summary, I think this DVD more than accomplishes what it sets out to do. When I go through an IVF cycle, I can put another post re: the DVD's impact on that.",1235692800,31,1409,4.673387096774194
3736497,5,B001OVFAA4,"I'm both an acupuncturist and a yoga practitioner so I got this DVD
to see if I wanted to recommend it to my fertility patients. I have
to say that I am very impressed. The sets alternate through the 4
phases of the menstrual cycle while describing what's happening at each phase.  I  especially like some of the folds they do, which bring blood circulation and energy to the ovaries ... you can feel it.  I think this will help women feel empowered and feel that there's more they can do to enhance their fertility.  By the way, they don't tell you that you will need a small towel for some of the poses,
so be sure to have one handy.",1234483200,85,635,4.223140495867769
3736498,5,B001OVFAA4,I purchased this dvd a few weeks ago and I love it! It is a very impressive integration of medical knowledge and yoga techniques. I found the different perspectives and ways to do the poses helpful because I'm not exactly the most flexible person in the world. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to get pregnant. I'm already looking forward to my next hpt.,1232496000,6,368,4.507462686567164
3736499,5,B001OVFAA4,"I really like this DVD!! It has 4 different practices based on menstrual cycle (luteal, menstrual, follicular, ovulatory). There are some with more familiar ""yoga"" moves and others that focus on rapid breathing. They provide advanced moves and easier modifications, but it is helpful to have some flexibility. This is not a typical yoga practice but I find it very relaxing.",1480464000,2,374,5.147540983606557
3736500,2,B001OVFAA4,"I have to give this company's branding and marketing team props because they really do their job. Don't be deceived by the pretty packaging and the fact that there are doctor's names associated with this product. I have many issues with this product and I feel that I am qualified both as someone who has experience with yoga and as a professional in the media production business.

1) This is just like any basic yoga/stretching DVD you'll find online...except they have you touch your uterus and think happy thoughts. The amount of time in each segment where you're actually thinking/doing anything in regards to ""fertility"" is negligible actually. It's really mostly just very standard yoga breathing and stretching and you can get the benefits from that from any $10 yoga DVD for beginners.

2) The production quality is awful. I produce videos for a living and I know exactly how much it would cost, in the United States at least, to produce a video of this quality. At cost, and I'm being generous, the product couldn't possibly be more than $4 for the company. And, yes, of course the business has to make a profit because that's the point. But, there are literally hundreds of cheaper, more in depth yoga and exercise DVDs that are cheaper with higher production quality.

3) I guess my biggest peeve with this is how clearly the company is tearing at the heart strings of women who are struggling with infertility. Women who have tried everything, who are grasping onto hope, who just want to have a family. While I did not expect a miracle with this product, I at least expected something different than basic yoga and stretching.

If you just need something to give you hope, to get you through the next cycle, then maybe this DVD will be helpful for you. But I advise purchasing any other beggipnners DVD out there for cheaper. There are certainly medical and emotional benefits to doing yoga, but you don't have to spend $40 to do it.

Side note: I did return this DVD to Amazon as I was clearly disappointed with this product. However the company charged me a $20 ""restocking"" fee so after paying for shipping I was only refunded $15. Again, each DVD is probably only costing the company $3-5 so they are even trying to make a profit on people's returns of the DVD. That's just not cool. Because I'm a Amazon prime member Amazon took care of me and refunded the difference out of their own pocket. They have informed me that they are now looking into this company.",1476230400,9,2478,4.648401826484018
3736501,5,B001OVFAA4,"I have been trying to conceive for over a year. I started this dvd on day 1 of my cycle and I conceived this month! It really helps

3736504,4,B001OVFAA4,"It's an okay DVD! I bought it because of the review, but to be honest, not worth the price at all.  I do like that it goes by luteal / menestral etc phases. But to be honest, it is quite not for beginners because they go pretty quickly, but yet again, they do state to do the yoga at your own pace. #1 dvd each phase is about 48 minutes, and the other dvd each phase is about 35 minutes long. I mean typical yoga class ranges to 45-60 minutes at most, been to tons of them in the past, but this does not out beat a class.",1463616000,5,521,3.824074074074074
3736505,5,B001OVFAA4,"After fertility issues, back-to-back treatments, and multiple induced cycles, my natural cycle was shot. I wanted to take a clean break for a few months, and get my body back to its natural healthy state before I resumed any further treatment. Alongside lifestyle changes, I also bought this DVD to get back to some kind of normal state. I've been practicing this yoga for more than a month now, and I'm absolutely elated to state that I started my first natural period in many months! This might seem trivial to most women, but for me, this is a HUGE deal. This last cycle was not perfect, ovulation was later than I thought it would be, but, just the fact that I had a natural cycle without any hormonal medication, and the next one is starting, is an enormous relief. This is very gentle yoga, and I practice it every morning according to whichever phase of the cycle I know I'm in. The lady in the green top in the video seems to almost always do the most advanced poses, while the others do gentler/simpler versions of the poses and they are the ones I mostly follow as I'm new to yoga and not as flexible. I feel like it always gets my circulation going, and I feel calm and refreshed once I'm done. I don't know if this is going to help me get pregnant, but I'm happy that I've achieved the first small step in this journey and this DVD definitely helped me get there. I wanted to deduct 1 star for the price since it is quite expensive, but thinking about it, it feels like a quite a bit of specialized knowledge went into it, since it combines acupuncture channels with yoga poses, and this might be the reason behind the pricing. In any case, considering the amount of money being spent on fertility treatments, this is barely anything at all and decided not to deduct that 1 star. I highly recommend it!",1462924800,6,1814,4.417910447761194

I bought this DVD and a book on infertility. I had no access to special things like herbalist and acupuncture. (We lived in rural Kansas getting organic fruit was a big enough challenge) I did add supplements and herbs that I could rider off amazon and faithfully did this DVD for the different phases for 3 months. The next time I had my 3 day fsh checked it was THREE. (I know they say only consider your highest fsh but read on)
That same month I was pregnant which resulted in a miscarriage. However I had HOPE I could get pregnant again. Three months after the miscarriage I was pregnant again this time with a healthy little boy who is now next to me! Spend the $ on the DVD. Do what you can.

I love that it is separated into 4 practices - one for each section of a woman's cycle. I always feel good after doing them - calm and happy - and enjoy the narrator's voice and the spa-like music. I also like seeing 3 variations of each posture with the three women demonstrating to show how to do each exercise based on your capability. I'm very grateful for this information and practice. We are TTC after 2 years of issues after having an ovary removed. Fingers crossed this helps us to achieve natural conception along with other lifestyle and diet changes we've made recently!,1427155200,2,698,4.682926829268292
3736532,4,B001OVFAA4,"In my line of work I pretty much sit most of the day. Logically, that is not that great for my fertility (although some women obviously get pregnant easily even though they spend most of their time sitting). I'm not athletic, and I don't get any exercise otherwise. I find that this Yoga set helps makes me feel like I'm actually getting some exercise. I'm sure this helps with fertility and overall well being.

Each phase starts with setting an intention for ""today"" which corresponds with your cycle phase. For instance, during the luteal phase the intention is to ""soften any tension and create warm and welcoming environment for the embryo."" The lector also explains that if implantation doesn't take place, the uterine lining will shed. When I first started doing the sets, I found that to be anxiety inducing. I felt pressured to feel relaxed/achieve relaxation, and guilty about not creating a warm and welcoming environment for the embryo. Eventually it was helpful for me to think of them as simply the intentions with which the yoga sets were created, and that because I completed the set of poses and exercises for the day, my intentions and energy were sent in the right direction.

There are three women performing performing the poses in each set, each of the women is representing a different level of advancement. One of them twists herself into a pretzel in every single phase of the set, and the other two hold the poses in a much less advanced way. Watching this one women holding the poses in such advanced way (seriously, she could perform as an acrobat for an audience) can be intimidating and anxiety inducing if you're just starting, or/and are new to Yoga and you are not able to hold the poses the same way (or even close to the way) she does, but keep in mind that you're supposed to pick the level you're most comfortable with, and I suspect you can work from there to higher levels if you wish. It would be more helpful to be able to select the level you are at, and watch only that woman in the video. My advice is to try to challenge yourself a little, but be realistic about your abilities and limitations. The first few times you'll do these exercises in each of the sets you'll find yourself staring at the screen, and you  might feel clumsy and silly (I did). After few times your confidence will increase, you will be able to focus on the exercises instead of nervously glancing at the screen. Now that I know how to hold the poses, and my own limitations, I like to close my eyes, focus on my breathing, and on the rhythm of the exercises, and it feels quite nice and peaceful. Dr. Horn emphasizes in the Introduction, that you don't have to be able to twist yourself into a pretzel to reap the benefits on this yoga set. As long as you're stretching, and keeping the poses as best as *you* can, you will benefit from the exercises.

The menstrual and luteal phases of this Yoga are mellow and relaxing. You will do a lot of stretching (which can be challenging but is attainable especially with the three different levels of difficulty available to pick from) , breathing and some meditation. They last about 30 minutes. If you have regular cycles, these are the phases you will most likely spend most time with. These are my favorite two sets.

The ovulatory and follicular phases are much more intense. You will actually be challenged (unless you are already a Yoga pro) by them more than by the other two phases. You will use the breath of fire (intense breathing technique that you will learn when you watch the Introduction) a lot during these phases. They are also few minutes longer than the other two phases (they are around 40 minutes long each).  I felt more tired and physically challenged by these sets of exercises, and I wish I could do them in the morning because they energized me (they're supposed to energize the ovaries so I guess it makes sense). I have a very mild form of IC (painful bladder), and I noticed that these two phases aggravated it a little.

Each phase starts with some breathing exercises, proceeds to the more intense poses, and follows with a relaxation and then ends with deep breathing again. My complaint is that the relaxation isn't guided. Basically you're asked to close your eyes, and relax for few minutes at which point the lector stops talking and you only hear the music and drums in the background laying on your back for few minutes. It would've been helpful if there was a short guided meditation included at that point. I find that my mind starts to wonder without it.

My final complaint is that there are five (if I remember correctly) true Yoga poses introduced without any instructions. I didn't know what downward dog, tree pose, turtle dove or one other pose mentioned which name I can't even remember were. I watched the women in the DVD, and I figured it out, but it would've been nice if they were also explained in the Introduction the same way ujjayi breathing and breath of fire is.

The instructions say that you don't need to have any extra ""gear"" to perform these exercises, but I strongly encourage you to get a yoga mat (holding the poses is much more comfortable that way), two yoga blocks (they are often mentioned in this yoga set), and a rolled towel. The yoga mat and the blocks, if you don't already have them, are an additional expense (you can probably get them for additional $30 total), but they are nice to have. That being said, you can still perform the exercises without them.

Some people have complained about the cost (I guess we are nowadays used to paying  less for DVDs), but I honestly feel that the cost is minimal because it's just an initial investment. Any gym membership or yoga classes will cost you way more because you have to cover the cost every month (or up front for the classes). By comparison, $40 total seems like a pretty small price for what you are getting. This DVD gives you the option of performing the exercises from the comfort of your home for as many months as you want/need. No one will hear (or worse, smell!) if you pass gas while stretching, loose your balance thirty times before you actually hold the ""tree pose"" or look more like sweaty whale than downward dog. You can simply close your eyes, and enjoy the exercises without any added peer pressure. You have the advantage of choosing time every day that's good for you. Finally, you can have your partner exercise with you (my husband and I do this yoga set together). It's a bonding experience, and (s)he will get benefits from it as well.

3736535,5,B001OVFAA4,"When I first started my period I had extremely heavy and irregular cycles. Almost immediately I was put on birth control, which did give me a regular cycle. Then about 2 years ago things started getting irregular. I went 4 months without a period. I was ready to get off birth-control, but was worried about memories of my heavy, and extremely uncomfortable period pre-pill. I just wanted a manageable, healthy, cycle and I was ready to do so in a more holistic and natural method.
I started taking chaste-berries (seriously look into these), drinking a women's tea, and doing some daily yoga. Two short weeks after changing gears I had a period! After a four month dry-spell I was stunned, but still hesitant and decided to wait before proclaiming success. I've cycled twice more, each cycle quite a bit shorter than the cycle before. I'm definitely trending towards a more regular cycle.
I feel healthier, more in-tune with my body, my periods are getting more manageable, and consistent. I'm a believer and my only regret is not doing this sooner.",1424217600,7,1050,4.838888888888889

I had been struggling with a range of fertility issues for a few years, which can be physically and emotionally exhausting. I had recently cut back on my running workouts and was in search of something that would still provide health benefits - both physical and mental -- but also contribute in a positive way to my reproductive health. This DVD proved to be that and so much MORE. Each phase of the yoga workouts are so intentional, poses and breathing are based on where you are in your cycle, and the instructions are easy to follow. I did the workouts for 30 days straight and while my fertility doctor told me there was pretty much no hope for that particular cycle due to thin lining, blah blah blah....lo and behold, I became pregnant!!! I'm now almost 13 weeks and everything is going really well with my pregnancy. I am confident this fertility yoga DVD was a contributor to our success.",1421798400,13,979,4.568181818181818

I like how there are different videos for each phase of your cycle both because it helped hold my interest by not being the same thing every time and it shows that the sequences are truly designed to target different areas depending on where you are in your cycle. The pace is nice and it was easy to fit it in so I ended up using it a lot. My baby is now 6 months old and I really feel like this video helped me not only physically but emotionally too - with the relaxation and the positive feeling it gave me to be doing something proactive during the emotional roller coaster that goes along with trying to conceive.,1406332800,7,681,4.246153846153846

I decided to try yoga before moving on to any medical fertility treatments, and I did the DVD pretty faithfully for 2 months (I missed a few days here and there). I was still doing the video in the 3rd month until we got a positive pregnancy test.

I have practiced yoga in the past, and these routines are not particularly challenging, but they are deeply relaxing and I definitely felt my arms getting stronger from doing planks every day. Even though the DVD arrives in just a slim cardboard sleeve, the first disc contains an intro segment that tells you about how and why the various poses are used, and how to use the routines in sequence.

The workouts were enjoyable, and at only 30-40 minutes long, they were easy to work into my schedule.

Also, it is a nice addition to my evening and I actually enjoy doing it. I have two children (not biological) and getting 30 minutes of quiet time is a vacation for any parent!  The physical benefits are noticeable too. Ive been using it for one week, this week I noticed (being that time of the month) that it is much healthier and easier on me in general. I feel like my body is really cleaning itself out, as opposed to other months, when I felt like my periods were light and unproductive. I still have cramps but this month I'm not cramming meds down my throat just to function. It is tolerable now. I'm not sure why the drums bother some people....they are hardly noticeable.

I stopped my regular yoga class because I was afraid it would be harmful during those dreaded 2 weeks when you don't know you are pregnant. So I bought this DVD. By the end of the month, I was pregnant! It took me longer to ovulate that month, but maybe it was a better quality egg? I don't know.

Due to prolonged breastfeeding and a recent miscarriage, my menstrual cycle was completely out of whack and 35+ days long- not optimal when you're trying to conceive. The first month using this program, I ovulated on cycle day 21, a full three days earlier in my cycle than I've ever had. I had a wonderful increase in fertile cervical fluid and a light, painless period. The price of this series would be worth it just for that.

Of course, most trying to conceive-ers are following a myriad of different fertility-enhancing techniques (as am I), but I honestly think the yoga is responsible in part for regulating my cycles, and it is a wonderful, stress-relieving ""me time."" Bonus that it is not at all invasive and does not have any impairing or dangerous side effects like more intense fertility treatments.

I have been practicing yoga for many years and thoroughly enjoy the poses, music, and narration. I'm glad that I can do something this intimate alone in the comfort of my home. TTC is a very personal journey and being able to use these DVDS instead of enrolling in a class offers a deeper degree of relaxation and introspection.

I also like that the poses vary according to the phase of your cycle.

There was a move that involves the front of the foot totally facing the floor for Day 1 to 8. That was tough and I endured the ache throughout the 1 to 3 min stretch each day. Should have suggested using the toes for support earlier rather than doing so in Day 9 onwards.

There was an explanation on how the yoga complements well being and fertility of reproductive system at the end of segment. Interesting.

3736575,5,B001OVFAA4,"I've been using this program on and off for about 6 months after being diagnosed with PCOS.  After several failed rounds of Clomid, I wanted to look into Eastern medicine and started doing this along with acupuncture.  This set is divided into 4 phases that correspond with your menstrual cycle - menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases.  While I have not become pregnant, our infertility issues are multi-factorial and I wasn't expecting this alone to do it.  My cycles have become more regular and I'm ovulating on my own now without drugs - I mainly attribute this to my acupuncturist, but I'm sure the yoga helps too.

I mainly use these DVDs to improve bloodflow to the reproductive organs and decrease the stress that comes along with infertility.  The DVDs are very relaxing.  My one complaint is the length of each video, from ~30-45 minutes each.  For PCOS, they recommend you do it twice a day which really adds up.  Before spending money on this, I would get a basic fertility workup done (SA, bloodwork, and maybe an HSG) if you've been trying a while with no luck.  This would have saved us a lot of time and money.  But for those of us who have moved on to treatments, this DVD set is nice for balancing all that stress.  You can continue to do it along with an IVF cycle too.",1355097600,16,1302,4.564655172413793
3736576,5,B001OVFAA4,"I have been using this DVD set for about a year now, and although I am still not pregnant (we discovered we have a male factor issue, hopefully resolved soon!), doing the yoga daily has definitely had a positive effect on my cycle.  My periods were quite light, but after a couple of months of the DVD I noticed that they were heavier, which hopefully means my lining is thicker.  The info that comes with the DVD says not to practice if you are doing assisted reproduction.  I assumed that meant full IVF and continued to do yoga while I took clomid for an IUI.  That cycle I developed an ovarian cyst which went away after a couple of cycles, but that also indicated to me that the yoga is effective (and not to do it with ovarian stimulating meds!).  I enjoy the sessions, they are quite gentle, with the Phase 2 and 3 sessions being a bit more physical.  Sometimes it's hard to get motivated to start, but I'm always glad once I've done it.  Good luck to everyone!

Update May 2016:  I now have an almost 1 year old :-)  I believe what really changed things for me was doing Julia Indichova's Fertile Heart work (I did the teleconference and daily visualizations).

3736578,3,B001OVFAA4,"Okay, so to preface this, I have only done the ovulation and luteal phases of this DVD.

There have been complaints because of the drums, but I actually like the drums. I think they fit the movement being done. I am new to yoga, so I don't know if that factors in, but I temporarly hurt my back doing the movements in the ovulation phase. There are pretty fast movements, and since I had been pretty inactive before attempting the DVD, I hurt myself. So just be aware that there is not a lot of stretching, despite the fact that ""yoga is stretching.""

My biggest complaint is that it is kind of boring. When i started the ovulation phase, it felt empowering, especially the breath of fire portions. But after doing it twice, I couldn't wait for the next phase. And since I have a really long cycle, I was in the O phase for forever! I am having a hard time motivating myself to do the DVD, and I am kind of regretting spending all this money on it. I plan on continuing, because I did spend the money and it is nice to have something constructive to do. But I almost feel that simply exercising 30 minutes a day would be just as helpful. If you aren't into eastern medicine, I would not recommend this DVD. You will roll your eyes at what they say during the exercises, as my husband did.",1346112000,6,1288,4.274590163934426
3736579,5,B001OVFAA4,I had to use fertility treatments to get pregnant with my first two daughters so this time around I figured I would try this also. I was actually on a month break from fertility treatments and I used solely this dvd set. I got my first ever positive pregnancy test without fertility treaments. I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome so this dvd set obviously helped me ovulate.,1345248000,14,373,4.666666666666667

They told me a donor egg was the only way to go and likened my ability of getting pregnant to a ""false glimmer of hope"".  I could not afford a donor egg at this time, so in preparation to receive a donor egg, I changed my diet, quit caffeine, processed foods, all sugars and decided to ""eat clean"".  I bought this cd,(and was kind of pissed off at the price) but figured, what the hell, Ive spent way more on infertility treatments.  I did the yoga everyday, read books about women who overcame the odds, journaled, did hypnosis and acupuncture.  I did this for 3 weeks after my last period, I am now 5 weeks pregnant, tomorrow marks 6 weeks, and my first prenatal appointment.  DO NOT LET the corny allopathic medical world tell you and your ovaries what you can and cannot do. You CAN do it!

I've have this stubborn tiny cyst for a long time. She said it was gone. She was as surprised as I was. Of course other factors could of played a role but the only thing I did differently was this DVD. I've done yoga for 10 years and this DVD is more like fertility exercises set to hatha yoga flow and often similar to yoga poses. It's great. I could totally feel changes happening. I haven't done it this month due to travel and house guests and I can feel the difference. I can't wait to get back into the rhythm of doing the DVD daily. It had a strong enough impact on me that I'm feeling ready to consult with creators of this DVD at their practice in LA. When I discussed it with my doc she was very supportive and said she thinks that they could probably do the same, if not more for our situation than fertility docs (as she handed me the referral to the fertility doc).",1342396800,6,1038,4.043689320388349
3736582,5,B001OVFAA4,"After a devastating miscarriage, my husband and I were ready to try to get pregnant again a few months later. I started doing this series on the second cycle we were trying. It really helped me to relax and just enjoy the cycle. I felt it helped me to relax and have fun with my husband. Feeling empowered by the yoga I was doing, I didn't worry that much and it lead to a positive pregnancy test before my missed period! I am currently pregnant and this purchase has been so meaninful to me. I would really recommend it to anyone, especially those who may tend to stress and/or worry about previous loss or infertility. I actually believe it has set me up for a more relaxed pregnancy as well. I liked that it has four distinct sections for each phase of your cycle. When I visited the restoring fertility web site, I noticed that 2 out or 3 of the women who taped the series became pregnant after taping (and one was not trying). Now that I have experienced this too, I just had to share my thoughts. I very rarely ever write reviews but this was important enough for me to do so.",1332979200,23,1082,4.282926829268293
3736583,5,B001OVFAA4,I started doing this DVD about 3 weeks ago.  My goal is the get pregnant naturally and get my body in balance.  This DVD is geared toward each phase of a woman's cycle which I can see if very important in regulating the cycle.  The DVD is also very relaxing.  There are 3 woman doing the poses and each has a different flexiblity level which I think is very helpful to veiwers.  There are also short sections on breathing techniques.  I hope to update this review in few months and announce my pregnancy and hope that it can help other women to conceive. The Eastern practice is much easier on a woman emotionally and physically and this is a great complementary DVD when trying to conceive naturally.,1328572800,2,701,4.480314960629921

3736585,5,B001OVFAA4,"I used to have unbearable PMS that would keep me from going to work in the morning. Then I heard yoga can help alleviate the symptoms so I gave it a try. I started doing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viniyoga-Therapy-for-the-Upper-Back-Neck-Shoulders-with-Gary-Kraftsow/dp/B000U0FZ0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viniyoga Therapy for the Upper Back, Neck & Shoulders with Gary Kraftsow</a>&nbsp;at first as it was easier and just took me 15-20 mins a day. It helped my back tremendously but no help to my PMS. So I looked again and found this DVD!

I know it advertises for fertility....but then I thought ""it's the same organ, might as well give it a try"" and to be honest it was the only yoga DVD that focuses on the uterus.

Anyways.

The DVD is divided into 4 parts that follow your menstrual cycle. Each part is about 30-40 mins top. I did watch it once first before I started doing it. You will need some blocks, towel, yoga mat and cushion to do all 4 parts. The yoga poses are easy to follow (I've never been to any yoga places before) and they have 3 people showing the poses on the screen at the same time, at different angles.

I must admit, I don't particularly enjoy the process but hey, whatever helps the cramps, I'll do it.

I did it religiously for 3 months (along with better life style i.e. sleep early, eat better, try not to stress over everything) and my PMS has reduced A LOT. I still have the cramps but it's manageable. Before I couldn't even move 1 inch and had to endure excruciating pain for 2 hours a month but now I can walk it off. (A little tip might help for cramps: walk up and down the stairs for 15 minutes or as long as it takes)",1325721600,10,1709,4.721476510067114

This is the first product review I have ever written, but I am amazed with how good I feel today that I had to write. The last 3 days I have been exhausted and I have had a hard time sleeping all week. Even my acupuncture appointment didn't perk me up (I blame holiday stress and holiday eating). Last night I switched from the menstrual to the follicular phase and got my first good night of sleep in a week. I have so much more energy today and the yellow coating that has been plaguing my tongue all week is gone! I feel like a different person today and I really do believe it was the yoga I did before bed that made the difference. I highly recommend this DVD.

I am not a Yogi, though have taken Hatha before, and am not particularly flexible. The DVD is good and relaxing, and is something I look forward to. Just trying to make sure I fit it in daily. I don't find the 2 main breathing techniques easy, and some of the poses are a little challenging. But it definitely makes me feel relaxed and forces me to connect with my body in a new way. I have tried to conceive for only 2 months so far, and I am hoping to have good results. My favorite aspects of the DVD are the focus on my uterus opening up and accepting 'new life'. They tell you to place your hands on it and connect to what's going on. I really really like that.
I find the background bongo drums to be a bit annoying, but tolerable. They also don't always segue seamlessly into each pose, and at times I have to pause the DVD and adjust my pose using 'props', which they don't warn you about, though once you do it one time, you are prepared.
Definitely recommend.",1323820800,5,1091,4.1753554502369665
3736588,5,B001OVFAA4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed using this DVD everyday, and I have hope after reading others' reviews and Dr. Horn's comments.  I had a laparoscopy two months ago to help with Stage 3 Endometriosis.  My left ovary in particular was covered by the endometriosis and surgery removed this tissue, but since the surgery, I have continued to have significant pain near my left ovary during menstruation and ovulation.  Prior to the surgery, blood tests showed I had a Day 3 FSH level of 13.4 and AMH of .62.  Now two months after the surgery, my Day 3 FSH is around the same at 13.2, but the AMH has dropped significantly to 0.17.  I am shocked and devastated, as I have been trying over a year now to get pregnant and had truly been praying that the surgery was our solution.  The nurse said there is no connection between the surgery and huge drop in my AMH, but I find that very hard to believe.  And so, I am truly hoping that applying the principles of this DVD will significantly improve my ovarian reserve and increase our chances of conceiving.  Dr. Horn's comments to an earlier review that it can take up to 13 menstrual cycles for new eggs to emerge gives me hope.  Of course, my ob/gyn says ovarian reserve cannot improve; it is what it is.  My prayer is that is not the case.",1321574400,3,1278,4.423076923076923

3736593,5,B001OVFAA4,"Having not worked out for a while, it took me a month to get used to this DVD and it's intensity.  After the first month, I started getting more used to it and loved it; and now it's the highlight of my day.  I love that it has 4 phases, ie the Menstrual, Follicular, Ovulatory and Luteal Phase.  I was diagnosed with cystic ovaries when younger; have been pregnant naturally last year (prior to finding this wonderfully amazing relaxing enjoyable DVD) but miscarried within a few weeks.  We had been trying for over a year prior to getting pregnant as well, so that's two years off our lives with high stress of trying to conceive.

I get ovulation cramps and pains regularly though since using this DVD, all that has either reduced or gone.  I had to stop using the DVD for a couple of months as I was ill and things happened in my life, and the cramps and pains returned.  I've resumed the DVD this month and within days of resuming it, the pains and cramps have gone and I feel amazing within.

I have been using the DVD for about 5 months (2 months of which I didn't use it).  Within the first month of using the DVD, my cervical mucus changed from hostile to fertile and my libido changed and increased.  I'm using it now mainly for the ovulation cramps and pains.  Initially bought it as we had been trying for a baby for 2 years and age wasn't on our side (we are in our mid 40s).  The continued disappointment of my period coming every month for a year since the miscarriage eventually got to me, and a few weeks ago, we decided to let go of wanting a baby as the heartbreak of having my period come each month was too disappointing.  We'd love it if we did get pregnant though have let go of the expectations as it's very stressful and distressing to keep getting a big fat negative on the pregnancy test.

I have other fertility yoga DVDs though always use this Restoring Fertility Yoga DVD as the sessions last about 35 mins, which works for me and I find them extremely enjoyable, especially as my cramps and aches disappear, I feel more energised, happier, and relaxed and my stomach no longer bloats out monthly and gets more toned, which makes me feel so much better within myself.  I can see this DVD being a part of my life for a very long time.

Getting into a routine is important for me to keep up the momentum and I've taken my yoga mat on holiday with me just so I can keep up my restoring fertility yoga practice.  I'm glad to be resuming it again as I feel the benefits already after only a few days and wish I'd started again much sooner than I did.",1312070400,13,2575,4.287190082644628

It is a fairly simple set of yoga routines offering poses that (my favorite part) you can do most anywhere. This isn't true of all the poses, of course, but there are definitely those that I've employed while standing in line at the grocery store, while on a long car trip, making dinner, wherever. These are not difficult routines, and those accustomed to more advanced yoga might be disappointed. However, for those who are in decent shape--I'm a runner myself--and new to yoga, this works quite well. I use the word ""works"" loosely here, since, while I enjoy this DVD, I am not pregnant after almost four months of following the routines. In fairness, though, the clinic responsible for this DVD clearly suggests it as a supplement to Western methods of fertility treatment (IVF, IUI, and the like), which I'm not using.

So, a worthwhile purchase, good for easing the discomforts of endometriosis, but don't bet the farm you'll immediately get pregnant, especially if you've been diagnosed with something that compromises fertility. If that were the case, I'd have to give it a fifth star, naturally. :)",1306800000,15,1334,4.982062780269058

They came back the next day but before the pain got very bad, she did the poses again and the pain disappeared again.  I do mean, disappear, not just lessened.  She still felt a little low on energy but with the pain gone, it was a liberating experience.  She also did not take any medication.

Although, this was not the intended purpose of the DVD it does show that the yoga poses can restore blood flow to appropriate parts of the body at certain phases.  Also, it made at least one person reclaim her life during her period and women know what a good thing that is.  So this DVD gets five stars.

***Read somewhere that when the uterus contracts to get rid of the endometrial lining during menstruation, this causes blood flow to the uterus to decrease.  When this happens, cramping occurs.",1298332800,14,1130,4.577114427860696

There are so many environmental issues that are affecting so many women's body that has created an increase in 'unexplained' infertility.  The western approach is expensive, unaccessive to many women and involves so many dangerous drugs that I knew it would not be an option for me.  So rebalancing my body and focusing on the cycle were critical focus for me, and there are so few material to help people like me who is seeking a drug free option.  I am also using acupuncture along with this DVD as well as eating organic food, and meat with no added hormones/antibiotics.
The DVD is split into four sections: one for menstrual stage, one for follicular stage, one for ovulation and one for luteul stage.  Each section is under 40 minutes of adapted yoga poses and are demonstrated by three ladies, each with various levels of flexibility.  Thnakfully, one of the lady had the same flexibility as me: inflexible!  I also recommend reading the way of the fertile soul by Radine Lewis, which I think is complementary with this holistic DVD.

I am working on menstrual stage right now and I will update as I go through each month.  The instructions are generally good, but on a few places, the instructor moves on without explaining a few steps!  So it helps to run through the DVD to see if you need the extra props for the less flexible or for those who are not as familiar with yoga poses.  I found this section is very relaxing, the stretches were wonderful and focuses of reminding the body to let go and relase the past as well as release past unnecessary emotions.

In my opinion, you don't need a ton of yoga experience to follow the movements. The only thing is that I wish that they explained how the movements are helping to ""restore fertility"".
