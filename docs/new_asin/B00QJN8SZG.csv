8691737,5,B00QJN8SZG,"Marion Cotillard is - no doubt it- one of the supreme actresses of the world. And she enhances still more the Bressonian tounch of the Dardenne brothers.

A simple decision. Will you renounce to a very juicy bonus for making one of the employers of the company returns to it?

What it might be a tedious film (in case of other hands), it becomes a compelling film with psychological devices and troubled decisions of a crowd of people involved in this thorny situation.

Purchase it and discuss it with your relative ones. You'll be rewarded.",1511308800,,542,4.684210526315789
8691738,4,B00QJN8SZG,"""Two Days, One Night"" (2014 release from Belgium; 95 min.) brings the story of Sandra (played by Marion Cotillard). As the movie opens, Sandra is awaken from her afternoon nap with some startling news. Soon we understand that her co-workers had a choice to vote on keeping their EUR 1,000 bonus and letting Sandra go along the way, or to forfeit the bonus and retain Sandra, and they voted 14-2 for the bonus.  Sandra and a co-worker convince the company boss to retake the vote on Monday morning, this time in a secret ballot. Sandra has the weekend to visit her 16 co-workers one by one to try and convince them to vote for her instead of their bonus. Will Sandra be able to garner enough votes in a span of two days and one night? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from the Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who as usual co-wrote and co-directed the film. Also per the usual, the film is set in Seraing, a blue-collar city near Liege, Belgium and where the Dardennes grew up themselves. If you've seen earlier Dardennes movies, you'll probably recognize some of the same streets and sceneries. Second, the Dardennes are well known for providing social commentary on today's society, and in this movie it strikes me that they succeeded on one level, but I question another level. They succeed in exposing the human condition of these ordinary people, where EUR 1,000 is a life-changing amount of money apparently. At one point when Sandra offers that she needs the money badly too, her co-worker responds ""I didn't vote against you, I voted for my bonus"", wow. But I question the premise facing the co-workers. Let me ask you, have you ever heard of employees being forced to choose between getting a bonus vs. keeping an co-worker employed? In my 30 years of working with dozens, if not hundreds, of companies, I have never heard of this. But if you can accept this premise, it of course allows some dramatic observations. Third, there are several noteworthy performances, none more so than Marion Cotillard, who blends in as a blue-collar woman trying to cope with what life is throwing at her. It is a splendid understated performance and I am thrilled that she scores another Best Actress Oscar nomination for this. Fourth, as usual, there is no musical score in a Dardennes movie, but there are two songs that are placed brilliantly: Them's ""Gloria"" and Petula Clark ""La Nuit N'en Finit Plus"" (the French-language cover of ""Needles and Pins""). Bottom line: this movie is the umpteenth prove that the Dardenne brothers are tops. While it's nice that Cotillard was recognized by the Academy, it is outright baffling that ""Two Days, One Night"" did not get an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Language Movie. Regardless, having grown up in Belgium, I am immensely proud of this film, showing once again that a small country like Belgium can make quality movies (Belgium scored Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Language Film last year and also in 2012).

This movie finally opened this weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was very nicely attended, I am happy to report. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign film that takes a concerning look at the human condition, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Two Days, One Night"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1423180800,4,3504,4.740983606557377
8691739,5,B00QJN8SZG,"The film's very ordinariness is its humanity. The Dardennes's brothers' filmmaking mirrors their philosophy. Film making is a collaborative phenomenon,a collective effort at putting together a vision. Central to the film(Two Days,One Night) is the idea of validation through work. Underlying their cinema is the ideal of equality in the work place against the obsession with performance and violent competition between workers in modern Europe and elsewhere in a global economy,stripped of union rights and lack of solidarity. As craftsmen do,the brothers rehearse their actor's thoroughly before shooting begins,so that the foot fits the shoe,and the shoe holds together. Cotillard,stripped of any starry persona,is integrated into the collective vision. She comes across as lacking energy,forlorn,despairing,but also driven by the ideal figure of her husband as coach to her fortunes. With each encounter to garner positive votes to keep her in the work place rather than take the bonus of 1000 euros each,we feel the rise and fall of her hopes,the ebb and flow of her confidence. This was aided in the film by her taking an overdose of Zanax tablets after getting 3 negative responses on the trot,and in the car when she,her friend and her husband sing along to Van Morrison's Gloria when things are going better.

The tragedy in the story is that the workers would effectively sack a fellow worker to get a bonus. Several of them are doing other jobs or activities to stay afloat. One man is very hostile,the rest are just getting by and desperate for the money for various reasons. This is their tragedy rather than hers. Intially there is very little sympathy for Sandra,but the film gives hope in that taking action can break a vicious cycle and help restore one's self esteem. There is a sense of a loss of humanity in modern work,management-led practises. ""If you don't have a job, you are made to feel like an outcast from your community,"" Jean-Pierre says. ""Possibly in the future people will find another way to be part of the community that is not connected to work but for now that is where meaning lies. From an anthropological point of view, that is how mankind feels a sense of belonging.""

""The absence of collective reaction,"" said Jean-Pierre, ""of any struggle against the principle behind that vote, reveals a very contemporary lack of solidarity."" Solidarity,even when ineffective,can make you feel better:what is grim is also rousing. In the post-socialist world we now inhabit,there is a Darwinian selfish determinism to overcome,where solidarity is not a given,it is a bonus. The bonus that is offered to each worker if Sandra loses her job,is a sellout. Amid the welter of fashionable nihilism and Hollywood's cheap sentimentality, the Dardennes stand for a cinema of hope and humanism and hard won optimism, courage and ethical conviction. Sandra is in effect saying the same thing to each of her fellow workers,making a plea to maintain her livelihood,she has to overcome fear and vote-rigging and a done deal,but the Dardennes's brothers show the subtle variations of responses of each worker. The film is made through each separate sequence being filmed in real time for maximum impact.",1422921600,,3216,5.123809523809523
