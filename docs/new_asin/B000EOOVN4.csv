8315517,4,B000EOOVN4,This is goofy and fun and a little twisted.,1500336000,,43,3.888888888888889
8315518,1,B000EOOVN4,Another over simplistic show that portrays Southern culture as overtly Redneck.  The men are essentially good but bumbling idiots with thick Southern accents and beer bellies.  The women are portrayed as trashy conivers.  BORING!,1420070400,,229,5.676470588235294
8315519,5,B000EOOVN4,"Super funny! This series started out on CMT, but halfway through they cancelled it and I didn't see all of the episodes. It's hilarious!",1412208000,,136,4.708333333333333
8315520,4,B000EOOVN4,I like this dvd very much. and I like the bonus footage. I like the way it the episodes are laid out in order 10 episodes  per disc plus bonus foot on 3 of the four discs no bonus footage on disc 4. Hope they put out a Season 2. this takes the place of Cops not releasing season dvd. I still love Cops though but this show is good.,1391299200,,331,3.7285714285714286

8315522,4,B000EOOVN4,i enjoyed this series a good bit. it was an interesting view of a world i wasn't altogether familiar with. I would reccommend it for anyone who is interested in other points of view.,1194134400,2,182,4.382352941176471
