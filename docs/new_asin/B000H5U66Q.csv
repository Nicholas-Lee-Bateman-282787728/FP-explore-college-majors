The highlight (if that's the right word) of this set simply has to be the Lesbian Vampires. This cast is so bizarre I couldn't resist listing several names, including the film's writer/director, who plays ""The Tongue."" (oh my!)

and

Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires.

Night was okay. It's low budget but done well. It's rather straight-forward where a guy meets a vampire girl who transforms him. It deals a bit with his crossing-over into the world of vampires. There's no fangs in this film. The vampires all live in a normal house, only keeping out of the sunlight. There's a very small amount of erotic content towards the end.

However the other films are a waste of time... several of them are so bad I have to mention them here, as they detract from the package

Vampire Hunter was a complete waste of time; featuring the star in what can only be a movie of self-promotion for nobody Sean Gallimore where he shows off all the fine martial arts moves he can make. At the beginning of this film a vampire defeats a vampire hunter in very poorly done fight sequences, but then Sean Gallimore steps in to show what a man he is where others have failed. The dialogue in this is too corny. Even the vampire is afraid of the macho Sean Gallimore who again appears in a scene where he does a number of posing matrial-arts films - the whole picture is like his own personal fantasy of how tough he is.

Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires has women who aren't attractive and would only be considered 'barely legal' if the age of consent was 30. This is an attempt at a skin-flick/vampire film but with women seldom getting down to anything but their underwear it fails to arouse

Lifeblood is poorly filmed. Unless you enjoy most of the film being in darkness.",1171065600,22,1630,4.544520547945205
