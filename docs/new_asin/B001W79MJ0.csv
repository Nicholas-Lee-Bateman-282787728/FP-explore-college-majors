3824273,5,B001W79MJ0,"This is the best show on television.  I'll spare you the long winded review, you can read plenty on the single season reviews.  This is the absolute best deal.  I saw the exact same set at target for 39.99 and the just the first season for 29.99.  You do the math.  24 bucks is unbeatable for two seasons + bonus a for a show of this caliber.

8347122,5,B001W79MJ0,"There is a lot of mediocre comedy out there.... stuff that is just OK.... but ultimately forgetable and a waste of time. 30Rock however , is one of the best. Really clever writing that stands up to repeated viewings. This is absolutely my favourite comedy from the USA at the moment.

(want a great British comedy? try ""Black Books"" on for size)",1246579200,2,345,4.564516129032258
