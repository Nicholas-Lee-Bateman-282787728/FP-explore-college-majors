8538291,1,B003WL0LD0,"This wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be. It's an instructional video with really difficult dance moves. I was expecting a themed show to watch with actors and a story line and lots of dancing, not a step by step breakdown of professionally choreographed dance routines. If it weren't for the cost of shipping, I would absolutely return it. It did come in excellent condition though.",1405555200,,395,4.6571428571428575
