Although its title is Lisbon, it has few places to visit and I can't get interesting enough information for traveling there again.
Maybe you can choose another one which will let you smile.
Try to search it!
Boa noite!",1188691200,2,283,4.568627450980392
8162345,4,B000LNG3RU,"This is a short video, only about 30 minutes, and it gives a condensed overview of Lisbon. While it does whet the appetite and remind me of the time I lived in Portugal, I wonder who taught the narrator how to pronounce the Portuguese names for places and things. This is so common with well-intentioned people who enjoy travel but who have no ear for foreign languages. His pronunciation of Alfama and fado made me giggle as I tried to figure out what he was saying. All that said Lisbon is a beautiful city and the Portuguese are wonderful people, just don't try to pronounce anything the way the narrator does and you'll be OK.",1179100800,4,630,4.48695652173913
