8159017,2,B00008ZZ9G,"As a ""Revenge of the Wronged Woman"" flick, this is OK.  However, because it's been sanitized to protect us from anything that might be disturbing, including the pivotal rape scene, we never really feel the heroine's motivation. That means almost any other movie in this subgenre is going to be superior.  My suggestion is to either find an uncut version or look for better fare.",1247961600,2,378,4.8
8159018,3,B00008ZZ9G,"A raped woman seeks revenge and combs the Asian jungle in search of her attackers.  Believe it or not this stars Ms. Montgomery(the cheerleader from REVENGE OF THE NERDS) She still has that sexual prowess but now with Bowie knife and Grenades.  Men cover your privates and be very,VERY nice to girls or Ms. Montgomery might be coming for you!",1217808000,2,342,4.683333333333334
