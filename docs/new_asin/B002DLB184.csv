3911583,5,B002DLB184,"""Into Temptation"" is one of those movies that I will watch again to get the other hidden meanings underlying the story, and this is a complex tale that explores myriad issues. Jeremy Sisto plays a Catholic priest in a poor parish, Father John who hears a disturbing confession from a troubled woman, prostitute Linda (Kristin Chenoweth). Linda relates her sexual abuse at the age of 12 by her stepfather, and other intimate details before proclaiming her intent to kill herself on her birthday. Instead of granting her absolution, John tries to get more details from Linda (who does not identify herself in the confessional, and the only thing John glimpses is her crucifix and the sound of her unique sultry voice) but she leaves suddenly, and John is left feeling tormented and guilty, obsessed with finding her and helping her before its too late.

There are basically two main parallel story lines, as John's harried attempts to find Linda plays alongside Linda's methodical approach to her birthday and its significance. John's search for Linda is tinged with humor as he finds himself exploring some rather dubious areas, such as the red light district and a porn establishment. This predictably lands him in trouble with the Archbishop, and his one ally in the church is another priest, Fr Ralph (Brain Baumgartner) from a more affluent parish. John's relationship with his fellow parishioners are also explored, especially with a jobless African American man who is enlisted in the search efforts for Linda. Both Jeremy Sisto and Kristin Chenoweth bring a measure of depth and credibility to their respective roles and the rest of the cast are also well-played.

I felt this was a sad movie - there is some sporadic humor throughout, but what was heartbreaking to watch was the empty soul that is Linda, a damaged soul who is quite certain she wishes to end it all, and who reflects that she would write a suicide note, but who would read it? The beginning of the movie has a group of children at first communion, and the ending of the movie features the same scene but with elaboration, and I have to say that this last scene in the movie neatly tied up all that the movie was - and it packs one heck of an emotional wallop. This is a compelling movie that explores issues of faith, redemption, and absolution. Highly recommended!",1256688000,21,2339,4.8159203980099505
3911584,5,B002DLB184,"I saw it on the big screen in August and was blown away. Don't expect any vampires, robots or aliens. This movie doesn't rely on gimmicks, it is a smart, challenging story. It made me laugh and cry, but most of all think. I wish more movies tried to do that.

Director Patrick Coyle's last film, Detective Fiction (Sundance Selection) was very good, but Into Temptation showcases his enormous talent with a strong and multi-layered script and unexpected, fabulous casting. Kristin Chenoweth and Jeremy Sisto step outside Hollywood's unimaginative casting constraints and deliver heartfelt performances that satisfy and resonate. This is a deep and nuanced film you will want to see more than once.",1256688000,11,697,5.114035087719298
3911585,5,B002DLB184,"This is one of those rare films that creatively blends a serious, potentially depressing topic, with smart dialogue, heart-warming characters, and a sense of humor that draws you into the film.  If you like to have everything all tidy and sewn up for you at the end of a movie, then this may not be for you.  But if you enjoy a movie that leaves you wanting more and invites you to engage in conversations with your fellow viewers, then you will love this movie.  I was also very impressed with how deftly the script, and the acting, managed to create characters that avoided being what could easily have been time-worn stereotypes, and instead made them realistically complex and inspiring.",1256601600,43,691,4.741666666666666
3911586,5,B002DLB184,"The opening scene for ""Into Temptation"", a leap back in time for the character played by Kristin Chenoweth, may break your heart.  This suspenseful movie introduces us to a variety of inner-city characters, foremost of whom is Father John, priest of a poor parish church that is still serving as their lifelong support for older members of its congregation.  However, there is a world of trouble for many inside and outside its doors. Father John finds himself confronting, and ultimately becoming a part of the seedier side of life in his driven and frantic quest to save a life. Your reaction at the end of this film will answer the above question for you.",1255824000,30,658,4.7631578947368425

Before seeing it, I thought this movie might be boring but it wasn't. It was very well written and acted. Despite not being a super entertaining fast paced movie, it kept me interested and held my attention wondering how things would play out. It humanized someone/people who we take as almost God-Like/exemplary; who we sometimes think have no fault, -namely the clergy. The story follows this particular pastor as he garners information about someone and their life and emotional struggles. He works diligently to find this person so he can offer his solace; so he can minister to them; so he can potentially save this person. This however is not done in his official capacity or as a representative of the church. He does this on his own time, and from his own heart, from one human being to another. The ending was unexpected and left a little to be desired, but overall a 3.5 star movie and worth your time.",1413072000,,1028,4.592391304347826

3911601,4,B002DLB184,"First, even though this is a dark movie, and about pain, and loneliness...it is also about doing the right thing even though we have to exert ourselves and may suffer embarrassment and frustration...and because of that...because several of the characters in this movie do that...we are all lifted up a bit, made higher, and encouraged to do better ourselves; so because of this, this movie is also a feel good movie.

But, there IS nudity, sexual situations, some cussing; but not much. In this instance it probably was needed to show the crassness of the environment, the pain of the situations that the people living in the dark live in. It made me uncomfortable, but it was not much.

Basically, you see a poor child at communion. It is obvious she is not well taken care of.

Then the story cuts to a priest doing confessions, and a woman comes in and tells him her awful life story, and that she is going to kill herself. It seems that the priest overwhelmed by the thought of this woman killing herself in a week, did not address her need for confessing all of this...to try to wash herself clean of the pain and guilt.  And either this, or his empathy, or ethics, or humanity set him trying to find this woman who was anonymous to him, having only seen the crucifix she wore through the mesh of the confessional and that she was young, and that she moves in the underbelly of society.

He tries to search for her in these places. When you hear confession, you can not say what was confessed; so he can't say why he is looking for this woman...and the ""people"" assume the worst for the most part. He is beat up, humiliated, afraid; but keeps on trying to find this woman to help her.  And as such, basically resembles the journey of Christ as he wades through the mire, afraid, humiliated, and beat up for us...trying to help us. AND what he calls each of us to do for others.

While the priest is the main character, we see humanity in the sampling of the people around him, and interacting with him. And we see the prostitute try to come to some resolution about her anger, hate, abandonment, loneliness, and greatness of her own spirit (which maybe she never sees, but those watching may.)

We don't know if he saves her...but we know the good he does along the path of trying to save her has a rippling effect, like a pebble thrown into a pond...so much so that even these pebbles reach her. What we see in this film is a person trying to do right, trying to avoid temptation to ignore other's pain or need or even one's own desires; and just like watching a person jumping off the diving board makes those of us who wish to dive think.""maybe I could do that too"", this film encourages us to care a little more about others, and realize even a small effort can mean a good deal to someone.",1403913600,2,2799,4.410852713178294

I liked this move A LOT because it made me think about myself and all I have to give, even when I'm at the bottom...saddest part of my life...I STILL have love and kindness to give.

Don't look to get your jollies. The seedy side of town, in one instance, looks like a Peets Coffee shop. The priest stares out at the dark sinful streets. I'm making fun here because this movie is just okay. The best part was hoping to see Kristin Chenoweth do her thing. That ain't gonna happen in this film. But it did make smile and almost laugh aloud in the first ten minutes. It's quirky. The characters are unique and have depth. The story is so think it ends with a fade to black. Important question never answered. I spent the day watching artful moody films. (I kid you not.) I watched three films in a row that end in..er...um...mystery? A poor excuse for a mediocre script. Each of these films used this tactic. I like a film that makes me think. But pulling the plug without rewarding the viewer with an answer to a key plot question is just mean. Tacky and mean.

The story is heartbreakingly real and explicates a long hidden social issue and problem prevalent, but never spoken about even in Parish affairs.  This is the elephant in the living room!  Sad beyond measure and so realistically portrayed and acted, that my sense of it brought tears to my eyes.  I am not gonna give away the story!  It is a sensitive drama about a real life situation.  I think children would not be up to seeing this.  It is a mature story for adults who have some knowledge of Catholic teaching, theology, the sacraments, and ritual.  Because I do this made the story more moving and familiar to me!  Great acting by all especially Fr. Sisto and his Priest friiend and the girl Linda and his olde flame.  The Boxer was so good and his Pimp Brother that they had to have lived the Life sometime in their lives.  The woman Madam and the woman hooker on the street were completely credible.

It is so rare to find a character who is a genuinely and thoroughly compassionate, yet very ""real"" and down-to-earth -- someone you wish you knew. The actor playing the priest is spot-on -- understated and natural. You forget the actor and believe his character is real. Same for his wise-cracking sidekick and foil. Terrific performances. The story line was compelling and kept my interest, and the ending was so satisfying. I especially like the surprise connections between characters who seemingly had nothing to do with each other. I didn't enjoy seeing a mostly naked dancer in a plexiglass, sound-proof booth, but I realize that it revealed how dehumanizing and impersonal pornography is. Except for that scene, I appreciated a movie that wasn't saturated with sex, violence, and sensationalized drama. Subtly and with integrity,""Into Tempation"" reveals how women can fall into the sex business and how devastating it is to their dignity and identity.

3911620,5,B002DLB184,"After Catholicism has been under attack for so many years due to the abuse of children by some immoral Catholic priest,this is one movie that redeems it.

Into Temptation is an independent drama film that tells the story of a prostitute, who confesses to a Catholic priest that she plans to kill herself on her birthday. The priest attempts to find and save her, and in doing so plunges himself into a darker side of society. Jeremy Sisto stars as Catholic priest Father John,who has become complacent in his vocation until the day that a depressed prostitute, Linda Salerno,played wonderfully by Kristin Chenowith,wanders into his confessional and reveals that she intends to commit suicide on her birthday -- and then disappears. Father John's quest to find and save the woman leads him on a journey into the city's sexual underworld, where he finds help from unexpected sources.

Into Temptation redeems the Catholic faith in the sense that it shows that priests do exist to help lost souls and bring them to God. Aside from that,it also explores the effect of the sacrament of confession. It was wonderful in the sense that it shows that this neglected sacrament does help in bringing people closer to God. Aside from that,it also examines the power of forgiveness and its effect to everyone. The performances in the movie were great especially that of Kristin Chenowith,who is outstanding in evoking the emotional complexities felt by the prostitute,Linda Salerno. She truly was effective in gaining the sympathy of the viewer. Great mention should also be given to Jeremy Sisto,who was good in portraying also the inner struggle that a Catholic priest like Father John does experience inside as a person and as a priest. Although there are many ambiguities in the screenplay as other events of the stories are left for the viewers to decide,this is one film that would truly be appreciated by many Catholics who wants to gain faith in the Church and their religion and people who love great independent movies.",1379203200,,2016,4.961538461538462

He spends the rest of the movie trying to find her in the hopes he can keep her from committing suicide.

A lot of people seemed to like this a lot and it escapes me. I found it all to be very clumsy. The few religious authorities (priests, reverends, etc.) I've met in my time have all been very sharp, articulate, excellent conversationalists. Too many of the conversations the priest engages in here show him as a rather bumbling individual. Granted, he cannot reveal anything disclosed in the confessional but I couldn't see where that was a problem with what he was trying to do. And the way things started to come together at the end bothered me. It was too much like a holiday family movie. I do applaud the producers in one aspect of the ending. They thankfully took the high road. The producers/ director also failed to build any sense of tension. There's a time limit implied and I felt too little sense of urgency, so when the story culminates, I felt it lacking in emotional gravity.

I'm not a big Jeremy Sisto fan and his performance here didn't do anything to help me out. He just seemed miscast, as did Kristin Chenoweth as the prostitute. It didn't help that her part was woefully small, even though the movie was as much about her as it was about the priest. Almost everything here seemed out of sync. The production values were decent enough given the content but the direction was lackluster. The whole thing needed to be tighter and more dynamic.

Not a bad watch I suppose but there are a lot better dramas out there to view.

By the way. There are a lot of 5 star reviews here and a serious number of them are reviews by reviewers where this is the only, or one of the only, movies they've reviewed. Can you say ""stack the deck!?""",1323648000,5,2180,4.453634085213032
3911638,5,B002DLB184,"I really can't remember how I ran across this feature, but I am very pleased that I did.  Being an ordained deacon in the Catholic Church and also having a son who is a priest, this movie really did touch home.  I was a little upset about the language used, but after watching it the third time, I felt, based on the content of the movie that it was necessary to tell the story.  It is very tempting to go too far in some instances, but I was happy to see that the priest in this particular movie knew his limitations.  We catholics sometimes forget that just because you are ordained, that does not also give you the gift of perfection as a priest or person.  I would recommend this movie very highly.

3911640,5,B002DLB184,"Into Temptation is a film that gives you a lot to think about. Things like:

--Isn't it great that there are some priests in the world who are unconventional enough to embrace the ""lost"" souls, even the prostitutes and bums, and treat them with respect and dignity.

--Humor and humanity can be (and should be) an integral part of the priesthood.

--Everyone can get a chance at redemption, but not everyone gets saved.

--Sexual abuse of children changes who they are, and who they become.

--Bullying (recently so much in the news) can have devastating effects that last a lifetime.

This was a great movie that, even with its serious topics, didn't take itself TOO seriously. The story line (and the wonderful actors) made you believe you were right there in the lives of the characters.

This was a fanstastic movie with great characters all the way through.  Jeremy Sisto was simply outstanding as Father John and it helped that he had a supporting cast that was just excellent.  Kristin Chenowith was also very good in her role as LInda, however Linda was more of a large supporting role than being a co-star.  There is no doubt that the ending leaves the viewer with the oppurtunity to discuss the plot with others who have seen it.  The film is about redemption.  The only question is who is the one being redeemed.  It seemed like there was  a lot of redemption going on in this movie.  There was humor throughout and it was well done, being incorporated into the plot with seeming spontanaity that made it so natural for the situations. Don't expect action or nudity or a lot of blood.  Expect a good story with excellent performances by an entire cast. View this movie with an open mind, an open heart and maybe some tissues.

3911649,5,B002DLB184,"A superb movie that makes one think (what a novel idea!).  Multiple themes weave through the story lines:  do we truly understand the underlying power of acts of kindness?  Does it matter if we don't know the eventual outcomes?  Is it more important to ask for forgiveness, or to give forgiveness?  Aren't we all tempted?  What does it mean if one succumbs to temptation while others do not? Does that make one a better person or just blessed with better circumstances?  What is most important in adhering to an organized religion:  following the precise rules of behaviour and belief, or acting out the religion's moral backbone of charity, love and caring; even if that means going out of one's comfort zone and safe personal enviornment?

Jeremy Sisto is fantastic as a priest who may not believe in all of the church's rules but personifies its better aspects of love, sacrifice and charity.  Kristin Chenoweth shows a touching serious side and major league acting chops in a role with relatively few spoken lines but an unforgettable presence.  Brian Baumgartner is comic relief as a priest in a prosperous suburban church who is ""taken care of in the manner in which he is accustomed"".  Mr. Baumgartner is able to use his comic improv talents which are often supressed in his usual gig on ""The Office"".

I highly recommend this movie.",1262044800,19,1340,4.824561403508772
3911650,5,B002DLB184,"Wow!  From the advertising, I hesitantly rented this DVD.  I thought this might be a story about a priest who battles with his biological urges.  While that might have been interesting, what ""Into Temptation"" delivers is a powerful portrayal of a priest as a shepherd who searches for the lost lamb.  Jeremy Sisto came onto my radar screen with the HBO series ""Six Feet Under.""  As Father John Buerlein, he effortlessly moves into the shoes of a man of faith.  This is a powerful performance worthy of Oscar recognition that will probably not be considered because it is a small art film.  But Sisto is amazing.  One of the most difficult of human experiences for an actor to show is faith.  It is such a subtle, subjective and internal experience.  The scene near the end where Buerlein sits in chapel with tears streaming down his face puts an emotional face on faith and connects with the audience.  The shadings Sisto brings to the role of a nontraditional priest who tries to minister to the person rather than a priest who experiences faith as if he were reading from a rulebook make us feel like this is a real person, one we could know and would like to know.  The performance and the subject matter make this a remarkable film.  Kristen Chenoweth who has long been a Broadway favorite and recently was on the series ""Pushing Daisies"" plays Linda Salerno, a prostitute trying to make amends and leave a life in which she sees no value.  While I love the bubbly happy musical comedy side of her talent such as on the recent lifetime movie ""The Twelve Men of Christmas,"" this rather sad portrayal may be her best film work.  It's gritty and real.  Brian Baumgartner turns in an excellent performance as Buerlein's sounding board, Father Ralph O'Brien.  Elizabeth Oas as the pregnant feminist parishioner Maria and Gene Larche as the homeless guy Gus also turn in excellent supporting performances.  Writer/director Patrick Coyle should be complimented on such a real, subtle and moving film.  I want a copy!  Bravo!",1260403200,11,2021,4.752873563218391

8365387,2,B002DLB184,"Meh. Kristin Chenoweth plays a high-price call girl who confesses to a priest (Jeremy Sisto) that she plans to kill herself. Melodrama ensues as the priest violates all common-sense professional boundaries, venturing into the red light district to find the girl. Meanwhile, a fellow priest and friend (Brian Baumgartner, a.k.a. Kevin on ""The Office"") tries to dissuade Sisto's character from his obsessive quest.

I picked up the DVD because I read some positive reviews for this Minnesota-based independent movie, filmed and set in Minneapolis. However, I must admit that my attention wandered during parts of the film when it didn't make me wince outright. Everything in this film is handled in pedestrian style, building to a predictable outcome.

Sisto, a Buddhist and normally a likeable actor, portrays an uptight priest here whose boundary-crossing behavior ranges from unbelievable to inexplicable. Despite the misleading ""Into Temptation"" title, we're never entirely sure if he's drawn to the call girl by physical attraction or by the compulsion of some past trauma in his own life, as the movie avoids any deeper insights into its characters. Chenoweth fares only slightly better than Sisto, offering a variation on the prostitute with a heart of gold that barely rises above average. Baumgartner is amusing and spot-on as the comfortable suburban priest, speaking in a ""pastor's voice"" that demolishes any resemblance to his character on ""The Office,"" but he barely appears in the movie.

Overall, the film's pacing is glacial, the dialogue artificial, and the script superficial in the extreme. As far as B-movies about troubled priests go, there's nothing particularly offensive or anti-Catholic about this one, and the sincere ending aspires to convey an edifying message about faith. But the TV-movie style, inexplicable character motivations, and pretensions of spiritual depth make this film a difficult slog. The whole thing is a sad, dour melodrama that never quite goes anywhere and takes forever to get there. The filmmakers are evidently very sincere about their desire for the film to be about something deeper; they just lack the skill to bring us inside of the characters.

Other than some previews, there are no special features on the disc. That's probably for the best, as I'd like to forget this one.",1436140800,,2330,5.272237196765499

8365390,5,B002DLB184,"A fine film that surprisingly presents a vivid picture of the everyday life of  the pastor of an inner city parish.  There is the believable friendship he has with a fellow priest to whom he turns for advice in his dilemma.  The film also shows his daily routine filled with  various  routine obligations and interactions with ordinary people and their problems.  The center of the movie,  a high class call girl who comes and confesses a sin she is going to commit,  she plans to take her life,  becomes an obsessive preoccupation for him as he tries to find her and prevent her from doing it.  The film effectively captures his inner turmoil in this struggle as he goes through major risks to find her.  The film also gives a poignant picture of the call girl's background and how she got into her lifestyle.  One gets the impression from the publicity that the  film is about a priest tempted and seeking this woman to be in a sexual relationship with her.  But the power of the story is much deeper and more powerful than that,  both concerning the young woman and the priest.  The film gives the tragic sense of the spiritual, painful  emptiness of the girl in the midst of a her successful  ""career"",  and also the torment of the priest whose concern for this woman's situation becomes overwhelming.  The acting was excellent.  A surprisingly  insightful film on many levels.",1419984000,3,1381,4.643153526970955
