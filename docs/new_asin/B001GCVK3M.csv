8304983,5,B001GCVK3M,I could watch these pups all day. What a way to cheer someone up when they are feeling bad. Kitty half time was also wonderful.,1284336000,,127,4.12
8304984,5,B001GCVK3M,This is a wonderful dvd set of a great program from summer 08 on animal planet channel.  The only thing that could make it better would be if there were chapters in the dvd so that you could skip to certain parts of the games.  Zim was my favorite.  It's great background dvd for when your cleaning or if just relaxing.  All of the puppy games are very adorable and entertaining.  The kitten parts were cute too.,1244937600,2,412,4.298701298701299
