1840620,1,B00008DDWQ,"If you wanna watch Kinsi and Alyson Hannigan embarrassing themselves by accepting to work in such a mean, bad and mediocre movie, than this is the right movie...

The history is a joke, direction is floppy, almost non existant, Alyson Hanningan gives her worst performance ever. It's one of those movies that, I'm sure, everybody involved , after watchin the final footage, excclaimed: ""What have we done??""!!

Awful",1122681600,2,416,5.102941176470588
1840621,1,B00008DDWQ,"There's a lot of things wrong with this movie....one being the wasted talents of its gifted cast. Nastassja Kinski (Cat People, One Night Stand), Alyson Hannigan (Boys and Girls, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Jennifer Esposito (Tv's Spin City, Master Of Disguise), Brian McCradie (Speed 2: Cruise Control), Steve Harris (Tv's The Practice, Minority Report), Todd Field (Stranger Than Fiction, Twister) and even the always awesome Alexis Denisof (Tv's Angel, Rouge Trader) are all burned out with a soggy script and its way too familiar and formulaic. It's about what adds up to be a bad bank robbery with everyone shooting each other up at the end. I really thought the accents of both McCradie and Denisof trying to do Russians was bad. McCradie is Irish isn't he and Denisof is like British..no, I'm not buying it for one second. Kinski, Hannigan and Esposito are all sexy but like I said....Not much fun...drags on a long time.",1110067200,6,932,4.942675159235669
1840622,2,B00008DDWQ,"The only reason I bought this movie is because Alison Hannigan and Alexis Denisof was in it.(I'm a huge Buffy fan)  I knew it wasn't going to be the greatest films ever made but I didn't realize how bad it was going to be.  Watching the film I felt almost embarassed for the actors since they were given such crappy material.  The story line was thin and it seemed like the movie couldn't decide from whose point of view it wanted to tell the story from.  It begins and ends with a narration of the ex-boyfriend of Jennifer Episito's character but for most of the film he isn't an important character.  The direction was horrible.  It seemed they tried to make shots that were supposed to look cool but it only looked like they were covering up there low budget of a film.  There were some scenes that made me feel like I was watching an episode of Dawson Creek or Smallville because there were quite a few scenes with songs playing while showing how sad or troubled a character was.  I really wish they had cut that out because it had no point and made the movie drag out even longer than it should have.

The only good thing about the movie was the acting especially from the three female leads.  I actually thought Hannigan and Kinski had chemistry together. I would only recomend this movie to die hard Buffy fans or if you're a die hard fan of another actor in this film and then you should only rent it.",1093651200,6,1409,4.343511450381679
1840623,4,B00008DDWQ,"Though I only watched it once, and I'd NEVER watch it again, it was a strangely odd but pleasurable experience.  The actresses were pretty enough and leading man gruff as expected, not too much chemistry between the leads, but a lot of interesting plots and action.  Good direction, but no sparks, yet i was on the edge of my seat, but for what, no great ending, but still i was on edge, there si a qaulity to the film work here and detail was taken seriously and the film is somewhat relaistic.  I wish i hadn't bough and rented thsi instead but it was overall worth it, but I can't expalin why... it's a troubling mystery",1085011200,,623,4.353448275862069
1840624,3,B00008DDWQ,"..but only because of Alyson Hannigan.
I think she did a FANTASTIC job of showing her talents beyond Willow in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and showing how she can play any role handed to her and well.
I thought this movie was good in most places and had a fantastic ending (which was a great performance by Alyson Hannigan - again!).
I would love it to come out on Region 2 for the Ukers.",1055721600,7,385,4.216216216216216
1840625,2,B00008DDWQ,"I was really excited about seeing Alyson Hannigan in a movie where she's not playing Willow (from Buffy) or Michelle (from American Pie). Unfortunately, Alyson is the ONLY bright spot in this movie and there was not even enough of her. It was truly painful to watch at times. Everyone else's acting was atrocious. Jennifer Esposito should have her Guild card revoked for her performance. The story was awful, the script worse. If you're an Alyson Hannigan fan, watch it once for her performance. Skip through everything else. You won't miss much.",1051056000,12,546,4.945652173913044

7982056,1,B00008DDWQ,"Packaging horrible - plastic overwrap needed knife to open, tape across top would not peel without tearing package.  Sound uneven, no subtitling - from too low too loud, must constantly adjust volume, so unable to watch movie.",1468713600,,226,5.108108108108108
7982057,5,B00008DDWQ,I liked this movie it is a nice little uknown gem bought it for alyson hannigan she was awesome in my opinion,1399939200,,109,4.0
7982058,3,B00008DDWQ,Only bought this Movie because the actor Michael Cole from the Mod Squad was in!  Movie did not keep my interest.,1379289600,,113,4.380952380952381
7982059,4,B00008DDWQ,"This movie was filmed in Hollywood in 2000, released in the Netherlands on DVD in 2001 under the title ""Beyond the city limits"", then finnaly released in the USA under the title ""Rip it Off"" in 2003. This is a very underrated film, it may have its flaws but I found the performances of the 3 female leads good enough to make it a reasonably good film, and viewers should take in to consideration the fact that this is only Gigi Gaston's second attempt at directing. I was glad to see Alyson Hannigan in a role that required more dramatic range than ""Buffy"" or ""American Pie"", I would love to see her in more roles like this but she seems to be mired in ""Comedy"" right now. The main flaw with this film is the poor editing, in watching this film I get the feeling that alot of good scenes were left on the cutting room floor. I would love to see a ""Directors Cut"" version of this film released with all these scenes restored.",1247616000,4,924,4.285714285714286
7982060,1,B00008DDWQ,"I myself am a huge Buffy/Angel fan,  I had read the reviews here and I thought it was worth a shot seeing it.  Well The script was terrible,  the story even worse,  direction - don't get me started.  One reviewer said it,  it was like they didn't know whose point of view to choose.  The soundtrack was awful.  The ending was sooo stupid.  did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them...  they just keep standing there.  Like nothing is happening.  I really haven't seen a movie this bad in... well...  EVER!!  Oh and Alyson Hannigan's acting was way better in My stepmother is an alien. I think she was about 13 in that role.  Don't get me wrong she's a extremely talented actress...  I blame it on the script.

rent it,  don't buy it.  You'll be embarassed to own it.  I am.",1157500800,,842,4.2756410256410255
7982061,1,B00008DDWQ,"One of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie: low budget, unispired performances (Alexis Denisof is particularly bad here), lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon, bad direction, despisable characters, cliched situations... How Kinski chose to act in this one?!",1123200000,,303,5.333333333333333

7982063,1,B00008DDWQ,"Never could have guesse that this movie would be so bad. COuld not reach the end of it, a very rare occasion!! The dialogues are so ludicrous, characters and acting obnoxious, I can't, I repeat, I can't understand how Alyson Hannigan starred this piece of... Shame on me for being such a BUFFY fan and having the bad habit of renting / buying anything remotely related to the cast of BUFFY....",1122681600,,393,4.549295774647887
