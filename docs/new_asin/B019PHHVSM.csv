7578773,4,B019PHHVSM,"Ernest Borgine was good as always, but the android cop was more of a leaning model, though competently acted, and John Amos was good too.  Video and audio were good.",1461715200,2,165,4.5

7578775,5,B019PHHVSM,"Whoa. A Mill Creek set worth praising?!?! Yes I am proud to say Future Cop: The Complete Series is a Mill Creek set worth praising about. Like all film collectors and fans of older television programs I was apprehensive to purchase sets by the dreaded Mill Creek corporation as they are, lets be honest, a bargain company. They are known for cramming as many episodes/films on to a single layer, double sided disc as possible resulting in artificting beyond belief. Thankfully their release of Future Cop has all 6 regular length episodes and its two pilot movies spread out onto two single sided, dual layer discs so the artifacting is/digital blocks are kept to an absolute minimum. The transfers are surprisingly great! No special features but with Mill Creek we shouldnt get too picky ;-)

Mill Creek is also known for packaging discs as cheaply as possible, as in storing discs in paper sleeves resulting in scratched discs with glitches. Not here! Both discs are stored in a normal keep case with swinging drawer in the center. Having a quality release of this obscure, older television series brought a smile to my nostalgic face, especially from a company with such a cringe-worthy reputation as Mill Creek. So don't let the DVD distributor stop you  this quality release is worth every penny! Perhaps they will use this same quality practice for some older television releases in the future we can hope!",1458604800,8,1412,4.879166666666666
7578776,5,B019PHHVSM,"Very entertaining short-lived show with likeable stars (Ernest Borgnine, John Amos and Michael Shannon), terrific music and interesting plots. In the PILOT,  Avery (Ronnie Claire Edwards) states that Haven is a composite of James Arness, Paul Newman and a young Lorne Greene! When Haven is told there is more than one way to skin a cat...His reply 'There are 37 ways'. Familiar faces from other 1970s cop shows like John Larch, James Luisi, Gerritt Graham, Harry Guardino, Albert Salmi, Katherine Cannon, H.M. Wynant, Sheree North, Joan Collins, Philip Abbott and Carol Lynley appear throughout the run. Prints are superb and the entire series is on two single-sided discs. Cover art is excellent.
Mill Creek have done a superb job.",1457308800,14,732,5.151260504201681

**UPDATE** (03/06/16) - The set arrived the other day - it is SUPERB!  The picture and sound quality of this DVD release is absolutely FANTASTIC!  There is very little grain evident in the picture and the Mono soundtrack comes through loud and clear.  Thank you Mill Creek and CBS / Paramount for this excellent DVD set!  For next year (to celebrate the shows' 40th anniversary), how about a DVD release of ""Quinn Martin's TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED (1977) - also owned by CBS / Paramount?  That would be epic...!  :-)",1451174400,16,1492,4.416058394160584
7578788,4,B019PHHVSM,"I was only 6 when Future Cop first aired, but have always wanted to see it. It was actually a pretty good show and kinda fun. Ernest Borgnine & John Amos put in some solid performances here and Joan Collins as a guest star ... always good to see Miss Collins.",1472947200,,259,4.098039215686274
7578789,3,B019PHHVSM,"Very dated and mediocre writing. Unfortunately, 'Almost Human' was vastly superior in every way and it was canceled too!",1470441600,,120,5.368421052631579
7578790,4,B019PHHVSM,"I thought it sounded like a fun concept and it was. I think this show captured a really nice chemistry between the android and human, and Michael Shannon's portrayal of Haven seems like a template for Data on Star Trek: Next Generation. Too bad the show did;t catch on, and run for at least a full season. 8 dollars well spent!",1468886400,2,327,4.377049180327869

7578795,4,B019PHHVSM,"A very short lived show from '76.  The stories are interesting but a little shallow and the plots are usually pretty thin. At the same time this was on there was another show called ""Holmes and Yo-Yo"" that lasted slightly longer but still only had 13 episodes. If you're reading this please try to contact the studio and encourage them to release Holmes on dvd.",1465257600,,361,4.553846153846154

8745668,5,B019PHHVSM,this tv show was ahead of its time and made it a true classic,1521849600,,61,3.4285714285714284
8745669,4,B019PHHVSM,"Interesting view of the future. In the short run, though, you could see that the producers kept trying to tweak things. Borgnine got an increasingly important role, the supporting scientist in the pilot disappeared and later became a cop. They kept changing the main scientist, and thought the Asian woman the best fit. The premise that androids not be allowed to use violence against humans (q.v., Asimov's Laws of Robotics) was generally handled well. The stories were generally formulaic, and relying on the ""gee whiz"" factor for viewership. With the producers tinkering so much, people couldn't get used to the setup, and the music was rather forgettable. If you like offbeat nostalgia shows, you might enjoy this very-short lived series.",1520294400,,742,5.191666666666666
8745670,5,B019PHHVSM,"This series was better than I expected, and I'm a fan of co-stars Ernest Borgnine and John Amos.  70's television has a vibe all it's own, often saddled by low budget productions, but which I enjoy.  Future Cop was a forgotten jewel, apparently.  It's carried easily by the warmth and energy of Ernest Borgnine as a solid, straight-arrow blue collar cop.  It's inexplicable how this veteran street cop almost instantly takes a shine to the robot rookie he is assigned to train.  And there's almost no science fiction action or special effects on par with The Six Million Dollar Man, the most popular series in the genre at the time, though Future Cop deals with the issue of artificial intelligence rather than robotic strength and speed.  The science fiction takes a back seat to characterization, and the series is an effective crime drama.  Too bad it lasted such a short time.",1519344000,,880,4.788079470198675
8745671,5,B019PHHVSM,good,1502150400,,4,4.0
8745672,5,B019PHHVSM,"Future Cop: The Complete Series for Ernest Borgnine is great. I think the show has a lot of good due to Ernest's portrayal with the android Haven. I don't usually like cop shows, but this one keeps you on your toes waiting to see the next adventure of the young rookie with this professional of 23 yrs on the Police force. It was a show ahead of it's time on tv.",1485820800,,362,4.112676056338028
8745673,4,B019PHHVSM,"This is a cute series with little real violence and a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor. A veteran street cop Joe Clever (Ernest Borgnine) gets an experimental android Haven (Michael Shannon) as a partner. A lot of the action involves chases (foot, car) and the violence is mostly guns being fired, although Haven Takes several bullets and appears to be repairable. A lot of the humor comes from the fact that Haven takes everything literally. I would rate this a G show suitable for all audiences. It's not the greatest viewing but I had a lot of fun watching and wish there was more to watch. If you like Ernest Borgnine like I do you'll like this. He plays his usual gruff character.",1475020800,,681,4.590163934426229
