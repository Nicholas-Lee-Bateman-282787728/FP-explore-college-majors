8532539,1,B008YGTE2W,"Warning! The copy we received wouldn't play in our DVD player because it is a Zone 2 disc, which means it was recorded to play in European players (Zone 1 is the United States).",1454198400,,177,4.235294117647059
8532540,3,B008YGTE2W,"Its a good DVD, but just be aware that its identical to ""Holiday Heroes.""  We bought both, now we have 2 of the same thing.  The only difference is that in ""Snow Trouble"" the characters film a safety video in between episodes.  Its pretty funny, so if you have to choose, I'd buy Snow trouble.  I think Snow trouble is for a different region (we have a region free DVD player) so check that before you buy it.",1389052800,,409,4.205128205128205
