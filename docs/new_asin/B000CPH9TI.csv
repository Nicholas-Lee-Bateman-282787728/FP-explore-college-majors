8187544,4,B000CPH9TI,"Add him to the list of  of people who cause Hare extreme stress: Dr. Clive, a lecherous white-haired doctor. And the second volume of ""Hare + Guu"" is mostly focused on that, as well as Guu's ongoing mind-games and superpowers -- it's a bit less surreal than the episodes that precede it (nobody gets swallowed alive) but it's still a hilarious experience.

Suffering from a cold,  Hare drags himself to the nurse's office, only to be threatened and generally abused by the new school doctor, Clive. He hates all boys, likes all girls (""more than the average person"") and seem to harbor a fantasy of seducing a married woman. In the meantime, Hare starts asking Weda questions about where his father is, only to be met by bizarre half-truths that may (or may not) involve the Mafia, alien abduction, and a pokete.

So guess who Hare's dad is revealed to be. It doesn't take much to figure it out.

Then Guu' headgames continue when she tells Hare that the hot new trend is to bathe fully-clothed, and poor Hare can't bring himself to ask anyone -- even when the class takes a trip to the Jungle Bath. And Hare has a perfect birthday of gifts, cake and general niceness from his friends and family... except for a squabble with Clive, who gives him a porn mag. Unfortunately, he ends up waking up in Clive's body, with Clive in HIS body. Will Hare learn to understand the pervy doctor, and will they get their own bodies back?

""Hare + Guu Volume 2"" sees the introduction of the perverted Dr. Clive -- annoy him and he'll pour disinfectant on you, throw syringes at you, and hurl you through the wall. If you're male, that is. If you're a girl, he'll be ""way too friendly"" -- and he has some startling history with Weda.

This new character adds some spice and variety to the show, rather than letting it simply be Guu's Weird Event Du Jour in the idyllic village. Suddenly we have some intervillage conflicts, more weird lines (""Those who laugh at porn will one day cry for porn!"" ""STOP SAYING PORN!""), and more general hilarity. And we have yet another thing that makes Hare freak out, as well as showing some details of Weda's as-yet unexplained past.

But despite Clive's new prominence, the poor over-stressed Hare is still the center of attention -- he's still overwrought and constantly annoyed/manipulated by Guu, and strange things still happen to him on a regular basis. He's also not very happy by the arrival of Dr. Clive and the revelations about the connection between them (oh come on, it's obvious), while Guu sort of floats around causing more trouble.

""Hare + Guu Volume 2"" has a somewhat different vibe from the first arc, but it's every bit as funny and chaotic -- except now Guu isn't the only one causing chaos.",1240531200,,2732,4.604938271604938
8187545,4,B000CPH9TI,"I'll try and be 'straight to the point' about this review, if you want my opinion on the series itself (which I think is hilarious), I'd check out my review on the first volume.

I'd like to point out three different things about this volume, 2 good and 1 bad. The first point, is that this set of episodes is actually funnier than the previous volume (which was already funny as it was). The second point (the bad one...), is that as funny as these episodes were, we were only given 3 episodes in this volume as opposed to 4 in the previous one. I guess the producers thought that since these were so funny, it would be appropriate to take an episode away...

Anyway, the final point I was going to make about this volume, is that they have introduced a new character (on the cover, its the white haired person on the right). This character was a great idea, fits into the show perfectly and is probably one of my favorite characters (somewhere in my Top 2). The character keeps the show from getting repetitive and pointless (which would have surely happened if they continued simply doing random stuff), this character's intro into the series gives the series more of a direction than before and Hare+Guu begins to have more of an overall point. Another pro about the character is that the english voice actor is as good as the rest of the cast. All this and I still haven't mentioned how much fun it is to see this interesting character interact with all the other characters already established on the show.

If you've bought the first one, or are thinking about buying the series, and even though there is one less episode than before, I'd definetely recommend this.",1160265600,,1672,4.548172757475083
8187546,4,B000CPH9TI,"Ok, I decided to try this series again. I think this series is growing on me. I actually liked this volume. It's pretty funny and cute. Not to mention I think I found my favorite character on this volume too.",1147824000,2,208,4.225
