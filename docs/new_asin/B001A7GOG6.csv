3445904,5,B001A7GOG6,Many people will think this movie is low quality all around. It is low budget but I think it's high quality all things considered. Kevin Schmidt is an up and coming creative actor who needs to star in more projects.,1268179200,,215,4.4
3445905,2,B001A7GOG6,"Resurrection Mary (Sean Michael Beyer, 2007)

Resurrection Mary, one of what seems to be a wave of urban-legend-themed films sprouting up in the horror underground these days (viz. Fingerprints, The Gravedancers, etc.), is actually one of the movies in the genre--and there aren't many--that could've shone under the right circumstances. It's got slick production values for a low-budget shocker, a director with a decent amount of experience, and a drop-dead-gorgeous lead. The connections even managed to get Robert Stack to lend them some Unsolved Mysteries footage about the urban legend upon which the film is based. Unfortunately, it's got nothing else.

Mary (Pamela Noble, from the upcoming The Diet Life) is a lovely young lass in roaring-twenties Chicago. After a fight with her boyfriend at a club, she ends up walking home alone. Until, that is, she is run down by a drunk driver. Fast forward eighty years, and the old ""ghostly hitchhiker"" urban legend has sprung up around Mary (as a side note, this is actually the case; Resurrection Mary is called by a number of paranormal sites ""Chicago's most famous ghost"", and even has her own Wikipedia entry). It strikes closer to home for Jeff Pryce (Cheaper by the Dozen's Kevin Schmidt) than most folks, as he picks Mary up one night after almost running her down himself and feels an instant attraction between the two of them. Oddly enough, the feeling seems mutual, and by the time Jeff realizes what's going on, he's in way over his head. Can he be the one to finally break Mary's curse?

The place to start here is with the acting, which is painfully, gloriously, phenomenally awful. Noble, the least experienced person on the screen during this movie, has the kind of flat affect that, in real life, makes me suspect a recent head injury, but her performance doesn't really stand out in this morass of acting stagnation. While Beyer managed to pick up an otherwise solid, if not all-star, cast for this, I've seen movies where no one had ever been in front of a camera before where the acting is uniformly better than this. It probably doesn't help that the script, co-written by Beyer and Ryan Lamaster, is ham-handed and mawkish, trying (and failing) to blend romance and horror. And my oh my, the special effects. The movie doesn't do too much in the way of effects, and after seeing the climax, you'll understand why. Not the movie's strong point at all.

But, you know, it looks really good. Cemetery junkies will love some of the shots in here. Everyone else, well, it's like watching a train wreck; you just can't tear your eyes away, wondering how much worse it's going to get. Trust me, you'll be rewarded when you hit that climax. * ",1233964800,2,2708,4.815053763440861
3445906,4,B001A7GOG6,"I happened to be invited to the filming of this movie for one night and came away impressed with many of the young actors but even more so with the Director, Sean Michael Beyer.  I think he squeezed everything he could out of his small budget-mainly due to the quality of his principal crew and his acting cast of mostly young people.  Budget was likely a little bigger than his debut film, Down the PCH, but as with that film, you see so much more potential that what the production values tied to the budget would indicate.  It is time for someone to step up and invest in this director with a few million dollar budget film.  He would definitely come through for them, I believe, and we could see even more of his talent.",1216771200,4,724,4.340740740740741
8276286,1,B001A7GOG6,"I thought Resurrection Mary would be a lot better than this.  It's about a ghostly woman named Mary who appears and causes problems for a young man named Shawn who's contemplating marriage and his devotion to his wife.  At first we see Shawn at a dance.  Mary appears, and suddenly Shawn finds himself walking to the bathroom.  He imitates banging Mary by rubbing his body against the stall door as the segment goes back and forth from the two going at it to yellow maggots going down a drain.  It's odd and disgusting.

While driving home with his wife Amy, they get into an argument because Shawn doesn't really want to get married yet.  You know how young men are- ""Yeah I wanna get married and love you all the time"" *the next day* ""On second thought the new Call of Duty just came out, so maybe not!""  Amy's insulted.  She throws her ring at him.  Suddenly Mary appears outside the window.  She's a hitchhiker so they take her in.  While sitting in the back seat she reveals the personal things Shawn thought about in the dance bathroom.  He was only thinking about that dirty sexual maggoty act.  Amy automatically believes this woman because who wouldn't believe a complete stranger?  Mary jumps out the door before the car stops.  When Shawn drives in reverse he runs over Mary and causes an accident.  We see Amy in the hospital lying on a hospital bed.  She remains in a coma for the better part of the entire movie.

What makes this movie horrible is that Mary isn't the least bit scary.  You can clearly tell she's a normal psychotic young woman (and attractive too with short blonde hair!) set out to torment not only Shawn, but the people in his life including family and friends.  But every time Mary appears on screen you don't feel scared or fear something horrific is going to happen because she's *way* too tame and normal.  I can't believe how poor her character is.

Throughout the movie Mary torments Shawn such as when Shawn opens an elevator door and sees Mary walking towards him.  Luckily he presses a button and the door shuts in time before Mary has a chance to get in.  But it's not enough!  A moment later Mary appears behind Shawn in the elevator and repeatedly bangs his head into a wall.  He's not really injured though.  At least the story doesn't make it seem that way.  Later on at night Shawn jumps or trips into a stream or river.  Mary appears behind him.  Shawn scratches her face and the scene ends.  Another scene involves a woman named Sophie.  She's at home and it's nighttime.  Sophie feels that something is wrong so she runs and hides in the closet.  Just then Mary walks by.  Sophie runs out of the house scared.  When she turns around the house lights turn on by themselves and Mary says ""Why'd you save him?  I know your secrets too!""  The scene ends.  I hate how these scenes end in the least suspenseful way ever.

This movie has to have the worst ending I've seen in a good while.  While Shawn and Mary are tossing each other around in a graveyard at night, the girl Shawn's with tries to come up with a plan to distract a graveyard worker and take him for a ride.  This enables the conflict with Shawn and Mary to get underway.  After they toss each other around the scene cuts to Shawn's friend, then cuts to Shawn cuddling his now awake wife in a  hospital bed to close the story.  Wow is this incredibly awful in many ways.  Good Lord!

Some of the writing is horrible too.  ""I was looking for a way out due to overwhelming problems"".  ""Would you rather trade those problems for a set of new ones?""  These are some of the lines you'll hear while watching the movie.  The soundtrack likes to enforce piano whenever a scene gets dramatic, but since the writing and story are so weak it comes off like a poor soap opera.

Even the supposed important conversation with an old man at a club was poor.  Shawn bumps into this guy.  He wants Shawn to leave at once.  The old man says ""Try to die a day before the devil knows you're dead"".  He then loses me when he mentions three tokens or coins for the ferryman.  The old man gets angry and says Shawn wasn't supposed to live.  Shawn doesn't know what to do. The old man recommends that Shawn leave Mary alone or Shawn will only give Mary what she wants.  Wow, the old man was supposed to describe the mystery behind Mary's ghost, but it comes off like a big mess.  This was supposed to be the most compelling moment of the story (or second most compelling besides the ending) and the writers screwed it up!

I strongly recommend avoiding this movie.  Mary's not scary and appears like a normal woman.  The viewers aren't scared and nobody feels lured into a compelling story or the ghost of Mary because the story's told poorly and Mary's presented poorly.  The characters are all boring and you don't care about them at all, or the conflict with Mary they have to persevere.  So the best thing is to just avoid this movie like the plague.",1499990400,,4940,4.428730512249444

8276289,5,B001A7GOG6,I bought this movie thinking it was the true story of Resurrection Mary. It turns into a slasher movie. But guess what? I wasn't disappointed. It was a really good movie. I was surprised about their direction of the movie. But I liked it. I Love Horror Movies & Ghost Stories so to me it was the best of both worlds. Buy this movie. If you like Horror or Ghost stories you'll love it.,1445299200,,384,4.202702702702703

8276292,4,B001A7GOG6,"I saw the movie online, and it seems to be a nice story. The movie centers around the main character who was falsely accuse of murder that was committed by a ghost.  However, ""Resurrection Mary"" helps to save him from trouble from the law enforcers and the demon.  Nevertheless, you should watch the movie to enjoy the story.",1395187200,,325,4.586206896551724
8276293,2,B001A7GOG6,"There are numerous places that have a legend of a female ghost killed along a highway, although most involve a bridge. In this story Jeff (Kevin G. Schmidt) who lives with his grandmother (Sally Kirkland) almost hits Mary (Pamela Noble) on Archer Avenue, the same place where his parents died in an accident. They start to see each other and then Jeff's friends start turning up dead.

The film has the same quality as a made for TV film. This is a romance/thriller and not a horror story by any means. I was bored for most of the production as the script and actors puts this film to rest. Might work for Lifetime film fans.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1388707200,,670,4.483606557377049
8276294,3,B001A7GOG6,"I struggled with giving this movie four stars instead of three but ultimately I decided that it misses the mark in too many ways. I am a Chicagoland native and love the Resurrection Mary story. It was obvious this movie was not filmed in Chicago. The filmmakers were familiar with the story, but wanted to add their own twist to it. They should know that you don't need a string of bodies to make a good horror film, and I felt the ""bloodletting"" in this movie was distracting. It would have made a much better paranormal romance. The actors and actresses were not as bad as the other reviewers described. Richard Riehle (Office Space) is a seasoned actor. Pamela Noble is beautiful and was perfect for the role of Resurrection Mary. I think they were just working with a bad script. It seemed like the production was rushed. That being said, I think this film had potential and was a clever retelling of the tale, it just failed in the execution.",1374624000,,947,4.543859649122807
8276295,5,B001A7GOG6,"Excellent story, a bit gory for my taste, but engaging none the less. Very spooky story of a for real ghost.",1362355200,,108,4.190476190476191
