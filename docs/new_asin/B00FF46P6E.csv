5986317,5,B00FF46P6E,"Been a fitness instructor/fitness club owner operator for 20+ years. R.I.P.P.E.D. is hands down best, most effective and FUN workout I've ever experienced!!! LOVE this class!!!",1386028800,5,176,5.8076923076923075
5986318,3,B00FF46P6E,"This workout is great.  However, it does not compete with the classes offered at the gym.  I went to R.I.P.P.E.D. at my local gym for two years and was in the best shape I have been since high school.  We moved away to a location where there are no classes offered.  I was excited to get this as I thought it would be like the classes.  A good workout, yes, but it has lost all the excitement of the classes offered in the gym.  Bummer.",1386028800,4,436,4.070588235294117
5986319,1,B00FF46P6E,I hate this workout. There's nothing worse than a repetitive workout. Couldn't they dream up a wider mix of moves? I wanted to scream from boredom! I'm giving this dvd to my dad to hang from his fruit tree to scare the birds away. Just AWFUL!,1496016000,,242,4.282608695652174

5986321,5,B00FF46P6E,Love this DVD! Did the R.I.P.P.E.D class at local Gym and loved it but instructor left and didn't to find the workout again.,1489363200,,124,4.434782608695652

5986323,1,B00FF46P6E,my husband purchased this for me as a Christmas present without knowing that I change my mind about the DVD. I attempted to return it and it was going to cost me six dollars which is almost the exact same cost as the DVD. Don't buy it unless you plan to keep it.,1482796800,,262,3.9622641509433962

5986327,1,B00FF46P6E,"The music was terrible and the instructors were irritating.  I was hoping it would be more like a R.I.P.P.E.D. class but it wasnt.  If that's what your looking for, don't waste your money.",1471305600,3,188,4.666666666666667

5986329,5,B00FF46P6E,Really like this DVD. The workouts are challenging but not so challenging that you give up on them. Also like that they give both more challenging and easier modifications for almost every exercise.,1468713600,,198,5.03030303030303
5986330,5,B00FF46P6E,"I haven't used the dvd, but my former gym used the dvd to format a workout class with the same name and it absolutely killed me physically. I saw results in one class, and felt like it worked every muscle in my body. Men and women alike had difficulty finishing the course and you can make the exercises as hard or as easy as you need, so it really can't be above or below anyone's level (in my opinion). I would expect this dvd to help tone any muscle set you need if used a few times a week, and will begin using it again myself when cleared by my doctor postpartum.",1468195200,,568,4.080357142857143
5986331,5,B00FF46P6E,I loved the R.I.P.P.E.D. Classes that I took in Hawaii now that I am on the east coast this helps me to keep my fitness going since I can't seem to find a class near me. LOVE IT,1466640000,,177,3.6842105263157894
5986332,5,B00FF46P6E,"I've only done this workout twice but I can already say I'm feeling it all over my body. It was challenging enough to keep me interested and I will keep doing it, alternating days with another workout with more weights. I have a good feeling it's going to be great!",1465689600,2,265,4.32
5986333,3,B00FF46P6E,"I like to keep moving. This video has too many pauses because they are showing you how to use the weights. It's perfect for the beginner but for someone who has experience, it's too slow for me.  Otherwise a good video!",1462838400,,219,4.341463414634147

5986339,5,B00FF46P6E,"I had this DVD for a while but I didn't think I was in good enough shape to do it, (I'm 57 years old - average weight) so I put it away.  But, I've now decided to jump in ... and I loved It!  I followed the modifier during the high impact segments, but all the rest I was able to follow the main trainers.  I love the music (it has vocals) and the good mood everybody is in.  Great workout!!",1450396800,4,391,3.7901234567901234
5986340,5,B00FF46P6E,I take Ripped class with my trainer and wanted to do some on my own at home when I couldn't go. Love that it offers to play with instructions or straight through. Video arrived before time and I started right away. My kids love joining in when I do it.,1447632000,3,252,4.06

5986342,4,B00FF46P6E,"This is such a great workout for me. Even after doing this workout weekly on and off for a year, it still continues to leave me sweating and panting. It has beginner and advanced modifications if needed. In between each segment they have an instructional segment that teaches you how to do the exercises in the next segment, which you can easily skip if you want to. (I watched the instructional videos the first time I did the workout, but I easily skipped them in future workouts.) This workout is fun to do even though it is very tiring and the instructors are very motivating. I did not like the ab workout, however. It didn't work my abs, and it made my shoulders pop because of the towel. Other than the ab segment being a total letdown, this is a great overall workout that you can do again and again and continue to feel the burn.",1444953600,3,838,4.378205128205129

5986348,3,B00FF46P6E,"I've really enjoyed the RIPPED classes at our local gym, so I thought this DVD would be helpful for times when I can't get to the gym.  At the gym, the instructors pump the music, which is usually very nicely choreographed to the RIPPED exercises, and the energy really carries you through the workout.  Unfortunately, on this DVD, the music is at low volume and the instructors spend the whole time talking, so it doesn't come close to replicating the energy I feel when taking the class at the gym.  There are options for playing each section with or without instructions.  So why the creators of this DVD felt the need to explain the entire time when you select the no-instructions option, I have no clue.",1435536000,,708,4.595238095238095

5986355,5,B00FF46P6E,"I love this work out. They are great motivators to work out. Your entire body will be worked out in 45 to 50 minute depending on if you also do the bonus ab work. There are 5 sections to the main work out and then a 5 minute ab workout if you wish to do so. After the main work out, there is a cool down portion which is the best part for me because it's like ending with a prayer without actually praying. To me, this is a body and soul workout and I ensure that I do it at least once a week.",1424044800,,493,3.704761904761905

5986360,5,B00FF46P6E,"Never as good as going to an in-person class. The endurance portion is a little hard to follow right away, resulting in a little bit of frustration. Music is pretty lame. But I was hoping the extra ab workout was the towel workout. It was. Pretty glad for that. Overall, this is a great at-home version of RIPPED to do when a class schedule doesn't work.",1414972800,,354,4.378787878787879

5986362,4,B00FF46P6E,"This is a good alternative if you can't get to the gym for a class and you need a fast fix. RIPPED only has one session on this DVD, so it's not anything more than a single session of the RIPPED workout. It is certainly not meant to be an entire program, but rather something to supplement or work together with another product.  I often use it in a rotation with other exercise programs to give me some variety. It's easy to follow and a good calorie burn!",1410739200,,457,4.193181818181818
5986363,2,B00FF46P6E,"Not a fan.  Tried this for a week and never really felt like I was being pushed during the workout.

I had much better results with P90X and Insanity.  When I completed those programs everyday I actually felt like I worked hard and pushed myself.

Not in the least with Ripped.  I think this may be just a quick cash in program that was not as well researched as the Beachbody brand of home exercise.

I cannot honestly recommend this product",1410307200,,442,4.395061728395062

5986365,5,B00FF46P6E,"This is a great workout! My wife and I both use it regularly and we have seen results. We've both lost weight and toned up more than we expected; over a 2 month period. It really is a high intensity workout and may not be the place where someone drastically out of shape would want to start. That said, anyone that is in at least moderate physical condition can probably do most or all of it right from the start. The key to the best results is regularity.

Personally, when I'm working (say, at my computer), I'll give myself a 10 second countdown. When I reach zero, I go start a RIPPED workout and just do it! I don't allow myself any excuses. Ultimately, it works if you do it!

The people that put this together clearly had a vast knowledge of fitness. The workouts will build endurance, strength, and will definitely help you to lose weight; if that is your goal.

Highly Recommended!",1403740800,,890,4.414634146341464
5986366,5,B00FF46P6E,TOTAL BODY workout!! Awesome music!!! Get your copy NOW!!! My only warning is you will get addicted and feel better!!!,1403222400,,118,4.95

Thhe ab work out, well yea that was a great challenge.",1402272000,,121,4.761904761904762
5986368,2,B00FF46P6E,"I don't like the DVD very much. First, I think there are very silly movements that add duration but don't work your body. Second, most of the movements are very basic (like standing biceps curls). The abs extra session is totally stupid, 80% comprised of lateral bends which have been demonstrated to be a bad movement for the body. I do not recommend this DVD.",1400284800,,361,4.569230769230769
5986369,4,B00FF46P6E,"Usually exercise videos get boring after a while because it's the same thing you're watching over and over again. I've done my fair shair of those and ended up quitting after a week or two.

With the Total Body Challenge, maybe it's just me wanting to actually do this program, but I actually had a lot of fun. I liked that I was sweaty at the end, my face was flushed, and I could feel my heart pumping -- and that's me as a beginner probably doing about half of what the people on the video were doing.

I'm looking forward to improving as the days go by and soon matching the video move for move.

Again, this is not necessarily for beginners. I had a hard time keeping up with the video but I believe that will come in time (it's part of my personal challenge!).

What I really appreciate it that they take the time to show you proper form so you're not just flailing up and down, side to side.

On top of the workout, there's a separate one for abs.

You'll need some weights or resistance band.

I live in an older apartment building so my neighbors didn't appreciate all the thumping and jumping up and down. This would work best if you lived in your own home or lived on the first floor.

Bottom line: A solid workout -- if you do it right!",1400284800,4,1248,4.192468619246862

5986372,4,B00FF46P6E,"I really enjoy the R.I.P.P.E.D class at my gym, so I was happy to see the video was finally made. However, as some have already stated, the music is really what makes this class so fun and keeps you motivated. I was bummed they had different music and played it so low. The routines are challenging and you will get a great workout, I just think they could've tried to give you more of the class experience and toned down all the pep talks and blasted the music to keep you pumped up. Good product, just needs a few tweaks. I also hope they continue to come out with ""Seasons"" so you can switch it up every couple of months.",1398038400,4,624,4.208333333333333
5986373,4,B00FF46P6E,"This exercise DVD is excellent for those already in pretty good shape.  But for beginners, take it slowly.  The exercises must be approached slowly or you will end up with pulled muscles or soreness.  But the directions are easy to follow and I liked that the hosts explained the exercises and made it easy to follow them.

However, working up to their level of fitness is going to take awhile, and this is perhaps not the best DVD for a rank beginner.  That being said, I would recommend it.",1397779200,,492,4.48314606741573

5986377,4,B00FF46P6E,I just moved to an area that doesn't offer RIPPED classes that work with my schedule. I was pretty excited when I saw this listing because this class is pretty addictive. This is a modified version of season 8. I miss the original music!!!! I agree with those who said that it would be nice to have the option of making the music louder. It's hard to get pumped up if you can't hear the music.,1396051200,,393,4.184210526315789
5986378,4,B00FF46P6E,"At around $20, RIPPED is a good intermediate or even beginner workout video.  It's a similar format to Insanity, but is cheaper because its only one workout versus a series of workouts.  They are all exercises you can do at home.  The workout can be done all at once or you can pick and choose what parts you want to do.  It is fairly interesting--it even kept our 3 year old somewhat engaged.  A cheaper and less intense version of Insanity.",1395273600,,442,4.407407407407407

While some of us found it a little annoying - I think that was more an effect of our disdain for workout videos (ahem). I think we all enjoyed it on some level and found it to be challenging and almost encouraging...  ;)

I would recommend this. It was worth the pain.",1395273600,,374,3.769230769230769

Beginner and Intermediate Level, but Advanced Students could still get a lot out of it
Fast paced
Easy to follow
Great instructors
Works entire body
No over-the-top crazy moves
Workout broken into parts for beginners or short on time
Links to Diet & Nutritionbasics on DVD, but refers you to website

Cons:
Full work-out is 48 minutes. I never have that much time!
Single work out

I felt like I was getting a good work out in while doing this in my home. I prefer at-home work outs as opposed to a local gym, so this was perfect for me and my lifestyle.",1395273600,,560,4.375
5986381,4,B00FF46P6E,"I am a home body exercise person: too hectic of a life to join the gym and get any value from such a membership.  hence,  I am always on a lookout for an exercise dvd to create a variety and reduce the boredom when you have to exercise at home.
As a stand alone this is a a good energy and beat and another slant to an 'all body' exercise, or isolated if you have limited time.  the instructions are clear and they demonstrator is fun and encouraging.  The word RIPPED should not put you off if you already like Jillian Michael's dvds ..it is much the same level.  if you want burn energy and tone without heavy weights or afraid of bulking up .. this is a nice alternative to the domination that Jillian Michael's has for women-stay-at-exercise bod.  i would recommend this, but you might still pick the Jillian Michael's dvd for it structure.",1395273600,,844,4.378205128205129
5986382,4,B00FF46P6E,"Since the closest gym is over a 20 minute drive, I like to work out at home to accommodate my busy schedule. I have a library of DVDs and am always looking for something new and creative. As a former personal trainer, I am very picky about which workouts I choose. There aren't any RIPPED classes in my area so I ordered the DVD to test out the concept.

This is an excellent workout and is appropriate for intermediate to advanced exercisers. Beginners could use this DVD with the suggested modifications but should probably just do one or two of the workout segments initially and gradually work up to the entire workout over a period of a few weeks of consistent workouts.

Pros:
- The instructors and likeable and give very clear cues and explanations of the various moves
- The exercises are creative and easy to follow
- Two of the cast members demo modifications of the workouts-- one for beginners and one for an advanced version
- Since the workouts are done in segments, you can pick and choose if you don't want to do the entire workout
- Each segment includes a tutorial which you can skip once you are familiar with the workouts
- The DVD does not include actual nutrition info (a con) but it does direct you to a website with some helpful nutrition tips (a pro)

Cons:
- The music (if you can call it that) is dreadful. Once you get the hang of the workout you can mute the sound and play your own
- At times you can't see the women who are doing the variations of the exercises, so it can be tough to follow if you need to modify
- Most people will not burn over 700 calories in this workout (as claimed on the DVD cover)
- The ""Bonus Features"" link on the menu just leads to two pages of text telling you about the creators of the program
- Not sure why they call the ab workout a ""bonus"" as most DVDs include this important segment. The workout is done while standing (no mat required) but it doesn't really work the abs and is more of a core workout. My lower back was sore the next day but my abs didn't get much of a workout

Overall, this is an excellent addition to a home workout DVD library and is well worth the modest price.",1395273600,,2150,4.262254901960785
5986383,4,B00FF46P6E,"This one really got me sweating.  The routines were not impossible to do for a beginner, though my coordination needs to improve.  The motivational comments during the exercises were cheesy, but I appreciate good cheese.  My only negative comments are that they should have had the lady doing the modified (less intense) exercises for us neophytes closer to the center so we could see what she was doing or included those modified routines in the tutorials.  Overall, I found the workout to be useful and this is a routine that I will incorporate in my exercise plan as a change of pace once or twice per week.",1395273600,,610,4.672897196261682
5986384,4,B00FF46P6E,"These videos are well done, and the workouts are genuine workouts taking advantage of interval training techniques with some light resistance training as well . No matter how in shape or out of shape you are, if you do these workouts as described you will be tired and get a workout. The workout was good.  RIPPED stands for Resistance, Intervals, Power, Plyometrics, Endurance, and Diet. This video covers the RIPPE portion, which provides for a good multidemensional workout. It's sorta like P90X stuff just less intense and less intimidating. I appreciate that this isn't all aerobics, or all dumbbell, or all plyo stuff. It's a good rotation through each that keeps it fresh and tiring. I'm glad I have it on my workout rotation.

The videos are pretty well done, but they do feel a little bit like my mom's old aerobics videos, cheesy smiles and all. I wish that the music was better and louder, instead it is sort of annoying and in the background. For future videos, maybe two optional soundtracks would be better, one with actual loud music to help keep going and another with no music just words so I can use my own.",1395187200,,1125,4.6767676767676765
5986385,4,B00FF46P6E,"This is a good total body workout to add to a home workout rotation.  It's the perfect length at under an hour.  I never stick to just one video, so I can't comment on the results of using ONLY this video for 30 days.",1395187200,,217,3.909090909090909
5986386,5,B00FF46P6E,"R.I.P.P.E.D. stands for Resistance, Intervals, Power, Plyometrics, Endurance, and Diet and nutrition (also included are 2 extra 5 minute segments: Cool Down and Bonus Abs). Each segment is broken up in 5-10 minute intervals. The purpose of this is to ""teach"" the upcoming moves in each section. Unlike other fast-paced workout videos, R.I.P.P.E.D. takes the time to explain the different strength and endurance exercises at a slower pace to give you practice before you are thrown into the actual workout. I appreciated the breaks because it gave me a little time to cool down and also helped to increase my confidence before attempting the actual workout. During each segment, there are a variety of activity levels shown for you to follow, from beginner to advanced. Not all the people in the video are in amazing shape, which again, helped to build my confidence. The video runs 48 mins (including the cool down) which might seem like a long video but it went by really quickly and each section was manageable for a beginner like me. I was quite surprised with the quality of the video, workouts, trainers (Terry and Tina Shorter), and music. Terry and Tina have an infectious positive attitude and it helped to motivate me to continue pushing myself. I really enjoyed the cool down portion where Terry teaches some Tai Chi moves (Tai Chi is said to help reduce stress). I thought it added a wonderful tone to the workout. I give this video 5 starts for the variation in possible intensities, instructional portions, types of workouts, and positive vibes.",1395187200,,1558,4.927756653992396
5986387,5,B00FF46P6E,"I love working out and do a mix of Beachbodys Insanity, P90x, and running. I also like trying anything new to keep myself fit. Its very important to me to mix things up so that working out doesnt become boring. With this in mind I tried R.I.P.P.E.D.

First, I want to talk about the positives of the DVD. It has a lot of variety packed into one workout. Its redundant to go through each letter of R.I.P.P.E.D., but if you do it, youll get a good full body workout and a great mix of cardio and strength training. I am in great shape, but was still a little sore after doing it the first time.

I also like how its a good, medium sized workout that can be broken down into chunks. Its nice to mix and match with ease if necessary. Even if you do the whole workout, it won't take up a ton of your day. Its a fairly intense workout without unnecessarily long instruction time.

There are a few negatives, but they're minor. First, although the music is well done, its not really my style. Also, the incessant smiling of the instructors and fitness models is a little grating. I guess being positive is a good thing, but I like a little more grit to my workout. But, these small complains don't detract from the overall product.

Overall, if you want a quality, full body workout in one DVD, look no further.",1395187200,,1304,4.310204081632653
5986388,5,B00FF46P6E,"This is an excellent workout program to mix in with other workout programs. It's upbeat and definitely does a good job of giving a great aerobic workout. The introduction does a good job of giving a preview of what the program is about. The Workout Options is the main program. it's a 48 minute program without the tutorials. With the tutorials, it's a 65 minute program. There's also the option of an additional 5 minute ab workout. Of course you have the option to run through the program with or without tutorials.

The program is run by a husband and wife team who do a great job of keeping the program interesting and explaining the exercises.  When exercising with weight or aerobic workouts, form is very important. Each section includes tutorials on proper form and movements for each of the exercises. The tutorials add 2 to 4 minutes per section.  The program starts with 5 min warm up to loosen the muscles and then gets into the five different sections, plus the cool down, and then the bonus abs section. The diet and nutrition is just a slide on information, but you can obtain much more information regarding diet from their website.

The only things you need are some light free weights/dumb bells. Even in the Power section, dumbbells are only used for 3 minutes. You also need a towel for the ab section.

The program is excellent. I haven't used too many programs because I like to create my own workouts, so i can't compare with others, but this is just as fun as a few classes I have taken at my gym. The music is generic, upbeat music that helps keep you motivated. This is definitely one workout to throw into the mix each week or every two weeks to keep things fresh.

Any program like this really just keeps you moving for 30 to 45 minutes, while altering exercises. And it's that constant movement that keeps your heart rate up.  If you don't exercise regularly, take classes, or do any of these types of workouts, I highly recommend you really take your time and develop the form correctly. Start slowly and you don't need to keep up the first few times. You can hurt yourself, pull a muscle, or weaken your joints if you do the exercises incorrectly. So just watch the lead in any program and develop your form correctly.  You also need to learn how to breathe properly to be able to last longer without getting tired. Exhale upon exertion and keep breathing steady.",1395187200,,2394,4.564102564102564

I'm not looking for the magic pill but I do want something that will keep me pressing play every day, at least for a while.  I thought this would be a grunt-work production for guys but it's quite friendly.  The instruction might be the best I've seen, they pay very close attention to good form -- almost to the point of slowing down the workout.  The instruction however, is like mini-commercials in between the workouts, and not a part of the workout itself. This way you can either skip over it or get some water.

I actually got this for my husband and for myself I purchased a more basic strength training DVD, but I really like this one and I'm going to use this instead!",1394668800,,811,4.337748344370861

However, I was curious to see how another single disc program compared, so I wanted to give RIPPED Total Body Challenge a try. The full disc is approximately 48 minutes and it'll give you a solid workout. What impressed me most was the detailed how-to section available before each of the exercise regimens. This is perfect for people who are new to working out and new to the RIPPED program. My only complaint is that everybody shown exercising throughout the run of the DVD is smiling at all times. I'm all for trying to help people feel comfortable with their new workout program, but this seemed a bit fake and maybe even a little creepy to me. However, don't let that steer you away from this program. It offers a solid workout and would be a great choice for those just starting out on their fitness journey. My rating is 4 stars.

Power is led by Terry and Polymetrics is led by Tina. The foot work on Polymetrics are tricky, I still haven't mastered them.

Definitely not the same workout intensity as P90x but a decent workout and not as intimidating.",1394236800,,461,4.609756097560975
5986394,3,B00FF46P6E,"I think R.I.P.P.E.D. would be a good addition to most people's workout collection, and fun to bring out every week or couple of weeks until you get bored.

The video is based on a training program by fitness instructors Terry and Tina Shorter and feels like a lighter, shorter program on the same lines as Insanity or P90X - relatively intense, mostly bodyweight exercises designed to work out the whole body.

Terry and Tina alternate the sessions with the help of a peppy music score and some background exercisers.  In all, there are 48 minutes of sessions in the main sequence that followow the ""RIPPED"" acronym - warm up, (R)esistance, (I)ntervals, (P)ower, (P)lyo, (E)ndurance, and cool down.  You can also separately select a 5 minute ab workout, and the dvd encourages you to go to the website for more information on the ""D"" in ""RIPPED"" (which stands for ""diet"").

I thought this was a fun workout, and I can see myself pulling it out every so often.  It's not as crazy intense as the commercials make Insanity or P90X look, and it's not a way of life, but it's a fun 48 minutes.",1394150400,,1088,4.61139896373057

Conversely, when you are working out, if you do the same routine most days.your body gets used to it and there are diminishing returns.  This video is one routine.

This might be good if you want to use it once a week instead of going to the gym.

Additionally, most of these workout programs are more reliant on you change of diet than you working out.  I.e. by doing this workout does not mean you can have that doughnut.",1393804800,,550,4.3431372549019605
5986398,5,B00FF46P6E,"I would probably be classified as an intermediate level exerciser.  I enjoy a good workout that makes me break a sweat but does not leave me overly sore the following day.  Before writing this review I wanted to give it at least three weeks of consistent use.

The program requires about an hour of time if you include some time to set up and a quick shower afterward.  One of the really nice things of the program is the variety of exercises included.  The regular changes keep it from getting boring and the music makes keeping a beat with the exercise easy.

A few of the exercises require weights and you should invest in a set of dumbbells.  You can still get a good workout without the weights but they add strength training to the program.  I have to admit that this was one of the easiest routines to keep doing instead of getting bored and quitting after a week or so.  Most importantly, I felt better and felt that I had a good workout each time but did not feel sore the next day.  This is a truly enjoyable program that works and I recommend it as a sustainable program over the others that I have tried.",1393718400,,1116,4.322115384615385

I like the pace and the fact that very clear instructions are provided between the sets of exercises.  Some other systems also ask you to have a bunch of associated equipment onhand (steps, dumbbells, chairs, etc...), but with this workout you don't really need anything other than yourself and a positive attitude.

Someone else mentioned the music and semi-fake encouragement by the instructors.  Of course, they are there to do their best to motivate you, and they're also there to act for the camera ... a tough job, no doubt.  Some will indeed find it a bit off-putting.

The workout is a full-body workout, and by the time you finish it, you'll have worked each body part.  It comes in a 48 minutes long, and is broken down into smaller segments.  There is also a tutorial you can watch for each segment.  (Other reviews have broken down the segments, so I won't do so here.)

The pacing on this isn't too fast, and the instructors give nice form pointers throughout the workout.

While I liked this workout after doing it once, it doesn't have a lot of ""fun factor"" to me.  The music was just bland (and so next time I'll play my own music), and some of the phrases that get repeated are a bit cheesy.  The background exercisers also seem to have a bit of the Stepford Wives fakeness going on.

Overall, this one isn't bad, but there are other workouts that I would rather use.  It would be good, though, if you're looking for something at the intermediate level to throw into your rotation every now and again.",1393632000,,1125,4.465686274509804

Also, each segment is different, so it's difficult to get bored.  This makes it easy to stay motivated for the entire workout.  The segments focus on strength building (e.g. squats) and also cardio work.

On the downside, each segment is preceded by a long explanation of proper form.  While important for the first time you do the workout, these form segments break up the flow of the workout, and you have to skip through them.

I am hoping this is the first of many releases to come. :)",1387324800,5,759,4.684210526315789

The creators do a great job explaining form and function, as well as alternative variations.  I would recommend this DVD to ANYONE at any fitness level as a great, comprehensive, total body workout!  There's always a higher goal to reach physical when doing this program!",1387238400,4,433,4.8108108108108105
5986449,5,B00FF46P6E,"New to fitness and don't want to join a gym?

This is a great place to begin.  You will get muscle endurance weight training for the arms and shoulders in resistance and then back. chest, and legs work with power section.  Intervals and Plyo will lead you  through some great atheltic drills at your level.  Finally, polish it up with some mixed martial arts and a great workout has been accomplished.

Afterwards, check with your gym to see if they are carrying ""the one stop body shock"".

Good luck on your fitness goals.  We won't stop!  Can't stop!  Don't know how to stop!",1387238400,6,577,4.514563106796117
5986460,5,B00FF46P6E,"After taking this class from my local gym for the past few years, I decided to buy the DVD so I could do the workout if I travel, or my kids are sick, etc.  I was pleased to hear fun music (most home workout videos have really boring instrumental music) and experience just as much fun in my living room as I do on the gym floor taking it live.  I love how each section is defined; you know exactly what you'll be doing (cardio, or resistance training) and the sections last just the right amount of time to leave you feeling worked-out, but not beat up.  I love that I can change the order, if I want, and it'll change the way the workout feels intensity-wise.  Grabbing a few for friends for Xmas gifts.  Hoping they'll have more released because I've not had this much fun in a home workout in a long time.",1387238400,2,809,4.193548387096774
5986461,5,B00FF46P6E,Love this program. You can never get bored because you are always switching among the different fitness elements. Perfect when you can't get to the gym!,1387152000,5,152,4.884615384615385
5986462,5,B00FF46P6E,"I actually teach this program in a gym.  I really don't like working out at home much, but I had sooooo much fun with this workout.  It's a VERY good challenge.  The Power and the Endurance section are off the chain (that's means extremely good lol)!!!!!  Great job!  Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!!  I had just as much fun at home as I do in my class!!!!",1386892800,6,348,4.044117647058823
5986463,5,B00FF46P6E,"I have missed R.I.P.P.E.D ever since the only gym in town that offered it, closed down earlier in the spring. I was so excited when they announced a DVD version, and I have to say I am not disappointed! Although I miss actual classes, this DVD is still full of the 3 things that made R.I.P.P.E.D so special to me: energy, efficiency and fun!

Thanks Terry and Tina!",1386720000,5,365,4.367647058823529
5986464,3,B00FF46P6E,"Lacks the energy and motivation that I get from a live R.I.P.P.E.D class.  The workout routines are awesome(includes some of my favorites from the class), but the music itself is what separates R.I.P.P.E.D. from others like P90x, Insanity, etc.  Lots of coaching on this dvd which is good for beginners.  I think I'd invest in a R.I.P.P.E.D music CD if there is one.",1386720000,2,366,4.777777777777778
5986465,4,B00FF46P6E,"I was attending RIPPED classes at my local gym for the past year but I recently moved and no longer could do that. I was really starting to miss RIPPED and I was happy when this DVD was released. Another reviewer mentioned this wasn't as good as a live class which of course it won't be but I must say it's pretty close. I've been doing a lot of at home DVDs over the past 2 months and RIPPED is so much better. Time flies when I do this DVD. It's intense and I am sweating when I am done. I can't wait until the next DVD is released...which I hope is soon :) Only recommendation I would make is try to highlight the music more. I think that is one of the best parts of RIPPED. Perhaps add a separate section where not as much coaching is needed. After a few times of doing the video you get the hang of it so really you just want the music and a few cues. Overall though, great DVD! I hope you guys plan to release another video soon!",1386720000,25,935,3.978723404255319
5986466,5,B00FF46P6E,"R.I.P.P.E.D. is the BEST workout around. This video will give you a total body workout. There are different levels for those who are beginners all the way to advanced options, it truly is for everybody.",1386633600,2,202,4.8

5986468,5,B00FF46P6E,"As a R.I.P.P.E.D. fitness instructor, this is GREAT for people who cannot attend a R.I.P.P.E.D. class in their local area for whatever reason. I have taught many fitness classes and done many DVD fitness workouts and hands down R.I.P.P.E.D. is for EVERYBODY at all levels. Take it while Traveling too! Although a live session is a bit different, terry and tina shorter and the R.I.P.P.E.D.crew bring you an effective ""body shocking"" workout where you could but up to 700 calories and more. Definitely worth owning.",1386028800,3,514,5.0588235294117645
5986469,5,B00FF46P6E,I started R.I.P.P.E.D with a local fitness company and LOVED it. It is a good workout for all levels. Unfortunately they no linger offer this locally so I SO happy they came out with a DVD. Got it today and loved it just as much as I remembered. I hope they release more in the future to keep mixing it up. :),1386028800,2,309,4.0

8615099,1,B00FF46P6E,"So I am a twice trained RIPPED instructor. and the reason I went back for another training is because a colleague was going close by our house and I needed CEC's so I thought I would attend, even though I knew I did not want to teach this format anymore. I chose not to teach the format for a gambit of reasons, and I have been teaching group exercise 18 years. This was one of my least favorite formats I ever learned to teach. Mostly because many of the exercises are not safe to perform in the manner and timing of which they ask to do it. At this point, I feel they are just trying to be creative just to be creative but forgoing safety in hopes of keeping up with fitness trends around the nation. Furthermore, I have tried numerous times in the last two months to email this company and call them and they have not responded at all to any of my requests. I need some information that I am entitled to, since I paid them for the training and it is in good standing. I guess since I do not pay for their monthly huddle, they must not think of me as worth servicing. So I hope this review will bring cause for the to respond to my needs and anyone else who may be experiencing the cold shoulder from them as well.",1513728000,,1216,4.11344537815126
