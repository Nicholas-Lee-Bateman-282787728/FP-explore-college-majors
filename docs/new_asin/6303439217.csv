chick, Alfred Pig, and Poppycock Rooster.  Your child will also meet Old MacDonald and Joanna. I hope to get this video whenever I can to play along with everyone on the farm.",1072483200,,300,4.537037037037037
646262,1,6303439217,"Maybe I am cynical or jaded, but this video is horrible.  It's uninspired, unimaginative, cloying, and very grating.  The animal characters speak in jokey, ""cartoon-character"" voices, the type that grown-ups with no sense of humor think that kids like.  Furthermore, the animals' dialog is nearly unintelligible because of the over-exuberant ""funny"" delivery.  I found this video to be just horrid, made with no particular joy or flair.",1009238400,2,436,5.462686567164179
646263,2,6303439217,"I found this video at a major dept. store on a ... rack last year and decided to give it a chance. My daughter, who was 4 yrs. old, actually got hooked on it for a brief time, which surprised me, because I found it pretty ridiculous and the quality of the material seemed low-budget in every aspect. I had a hard time sitting through it. However, I've paid much more for popular videos that she showed considerably less interest in. I guess you never know what children will find entertaining, as this somewhat strange video proved.",998956800,,532,4.494845360824742
646264,5,6303439217,"Chris Fesko does an amazing job of integrating videography, music, and FUN into a wonderful depiction of agricultural life today. This is NOT a cartoon!! This is real live animals, machinery, and breath-taking landscape  right from their own farm. I purchased the entire series for our elementary  school library. Kids today need to know where their food comes from! I have  also used this series in Long Term Care facilties. They loved the fast  paced action and close up shots combined with music that just makes you  want to tap your toes! Would make a wonderful gift for any occasion.",939686400,,588,4.84
646265,5,6303439217,"First in a series of farm videos done by Chris Fesko, we love them all! Our children and their friends love to watch the hustle and bustle of the Feskos' busy farm. Even though we use this as an educational video, the  Fesko sense of fun and adventure shine through, making for an enjoyable  viewing experience for the entire family.",939427200,,333,4.533333333333333

7847122,5,6303439217,This is a fascinating series for history buffs and 'back to the farm' dreamers and former hippies...the improvisation and creativity required during the war is impressive and amusing as well.,1492560000,2,191,5.4
7847123,1,6303439217,"Well, the picture quality was fantastic but there was NO AUDIO. Is there any possible way to find a copy with audio?",1473120000,,116,4.318181818181818

7847127,5,6303439217,"The many eras presented in the overall series make it worth buying a region-free/multi-region DVD player.  When any of these arrive, I drop everything until I've watched them all.  This one is somewhat different from their usual as it's sufficiently recent that they were able to interview people who lived through WWII including Ruth's Dad. Fascinating as always.",1428192000,2,364,5.258620689655173
7847128,5,6303439217,I have loved ALL the farm series and wish there were more!  This one was outstanding and so thought provoking.  It would be good for younger people to watch and understand the sacrifices made by that generation!  I also love the cheerful commitment of the cast to really relive the past with authenticity.,1426809600,2,305,4.716981132075472
7847129,5,6303439217,Wartime Farm is a fabulous series!  I'm surprised it's not in North American format.  The region 2 version plays nicely on my old laptop (once I changed the preference) that I've wired to a larger TV monitor.,1418515200,5,208,4.594594594594595
7847130,5,6303439217,"In any retelling of the second world war experience, it goes without saying, that the bulk of historical research, and resulting data, goes into recreating the experiences of the Armed forces. As the United Kingdom, as whole, was involved from the beginning of hostillities, in every conceivable way,in fact, total war. Britain had to re-organise itself in such a comprehensive way, that historians --post war, concluded that Britain had become a virtual Socialist state during those war years. The main worry, was not being able to feed ourselves , and the very real and dangerous risk of being starved into submission, because we were loosing shippments of food--materials, and men, on a colossal scale, in the battle of the Atlantic, by mass attacks from Hitlers U-Boats. Every usable acre of land had to be ploughed up and used for growing food-even the Royal Parks. This TV series is a very accurate and detailed recreation of that period, but as usual, portrayed by the familiar trio of presenters, in their usual easy to follow and humorous way. No area of day- to-day aspects of living the life on a farm, has been left out: from legal obligations to the state,( which was considerable), use of prisoner of war labour ( and local children), to all the technical aids and developments, born out of necessity, that laid down the path to modern post war agricultural practices. The details are very considerable, and it would be unwarranted to try and describe further. I strongly recommend this series--especially if you have enjoyed the previous series/seasons, covering earlier British Rural history .  P G Croft UK.",1384214400,9,1624,4.992619926199262
