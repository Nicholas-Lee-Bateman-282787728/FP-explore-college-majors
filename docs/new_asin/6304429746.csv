872720,1,6304429746,"My friend Judy gets to review this movie for me because I suggested she watch it and this is a condition of forgiveness:

Since I have to give this one star, let the star be a collapsing black dwarf.

Sterling Hayden gives the worst performance in any actor's life.  He might as well be a talking roast beef.  My friend said ""lutefisk?"" but his Swedish accent does not bear up under the comparison.

It isn't just the movie that's bad--the score (guitar, trumpet, ?, etc.?) was obviously written by an escapee from the Insane Musicians' Mexican Rest Home.

Nuff said.

P.S.  I have a friend who says ""blame it on the director.""  OK.  Blame it on the director.",1157155200,6,659,4.508474576271187
872721,4,6304429746,"Dressed in a squared-off bowler, a wool jacket that doesn't cover his wrists, a stubby tie and sporting a painfully off-key Swedish accent, Sterling Hayden is an unlikely western hero.  That ten-foot steel tipped harpoon he carries around doesn't help to buff the image much, either.  Then again TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN is an unlikely western.  Scripted by blacklisted Hollywood writer Dalton Trumbo (Ben Perry received credit), it's ostensibly about a land robber (Sebastian Cabot as Ed McNeil) using means fair and foul (Ned Young as hired-gun Johnny Crale) to buy out the homesteaders in the small community of Prairie City, Texas.  It's also about standing united against injustice, and not letting fear conquer integrity.

  Hayden's George Hansen comes to the Prairie City after twenty years at sea to reunite with his father and help him on the farm the elder Hansen built in his absence.  It was a farm coveted by McNeil as well, and hired goon Crale saw to the ""Or else"" part when McNeil's offer to buy it from the elder Hansen was rebuffed.  The cowed community is too intimidated by McNeil to stand up to him, strength in unity or not.  It's up to the foreign outsider to discover who murdered his father - the McNeil owned sheriff isn't going to tell, and the otherwise good folks don't want to get involved.

  I'm not usually a great fan of the message westerns of the fifties.  However noble it was to fight McCarthyism, it doesn't usually make for an interesting story - too many cowardly and townspeople for my tastes, too self-righteous a tone.  Half the time I find myself rooting for the bad guy. TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN is all that, to be sure, but the acting is generally strong, the musical score is interesting, and the pace doesn't relax too much.  If the movie has to preach at me, at least this one offers an interestingly illustrated sermon.

  If Hayden is a little stony and robotic in the lead, Cabot is wonderfully malicious as the velvet gloved big money bad guy and the relatively unknown Ned Young (looks a little like Humphrey Bogart) is beautifully understated as the steel-fisted thug.  The movie also contains one of the oddest curtain closing shootout in western movie history.  Strong recommendation for this little gem.",1117756800,13,2259,4.770618556701031
872722,5,6304429746,If this is not a cult film I don't know what one is. The opening scene of Sterling Hayden walking down the main street of a Western town with harpoon in-hand to meet a gunman clad in black is just so offbeat one finds it difficult not to be enthralled and immediately immersed into the story. Hayden seems to have been breed for these types of films but with his pseudo-Swedish accent it just makes it all the more bizarre. Even more bizarre is Nedrick Youngs portrayal of Johnny Crale the gunman in black. Now working for Ed McNeil (Sebastian Cabot) we learn that Crale had his right hand blown off and had it replaced with a steel one. Crale must now use his left hand to do his shooting which has diminished his skills. Basically Ed McNeil has hired gunman Crale to buy out or kill all the local landowners in town. What is really offbeat his how gunman Crale confronts each landowner and explains to each one his own perverse code of conduct and how he must carry out his duties as a gunman. Victor Millan as farmer Jose Mirada will not beg for his life and he explains it is his duty to die in dignity at the hand of Crale. Eventually Hayden the Swedish seaman must face Crale in probably the most bizarre and offbeat shootout ever filmed. I had not seen this film in over forty years until recently but I never forgot the incredible finale. Under Joseph H. Lewis direction it is style and offbeat characterizations that sets this film apart from its rather ordinary plot.  Even the score by composer Gerald Fried is rather contradictory and strangely upbeat in some scenes. This is definitely a low budget film but a very effective one.,1001376000,18,1642,4.473333333333334
872723,3,6304429746,"Joseph Lewis (My Name is Julia Ross, Gun Crazy) fans will likely be rather disappointed; this is not his finest hour-and-a-half. His films often trod on hoary ground; Big Combo could've been just another cops-and-robbers tale. But it is inventive direction, kinetic atmosphere and chiaroscuro camerawork which distinguish his work, and those elements are largely not to be found here.
Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Johnny Guitar) gives another of his ruggedly natural performances, this time as a whaler who comes to his father's Texas home, only to find Sebastian Cabot (Twice-Told Tales, The Time Machine) ruling the town with an iron fist. He wants everyone's oil-rich land, you see. Sound familiar? Of course it does. 'T in a TT' is unflinchingly violent, even a little bit subversive (Dalton Trumbo scripted it) in a Peckinpah way, and jumpily structured after the fashion of pulpy noir. But none of these things make it any more than what it is: just a fairly standard oater with an unusual conclusion.
The conclusion is really the only reason this film is remembered: it features a dusty-street showdown between hired gun and harpoon. Even so, we saw everything but the outcome of said duel in the first portions of the film. This one aspect is so askew from the norm that it might distract you from the implausibility. Or from the fact that everything else has been pretty much connecting the dots.

873198,4,6304429746,"Written by Dalton Trumbo (Ben L Perry in credits) during his blacklisted years TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN deserves mention as a movie that was written with McCarthyism in mind (the sermon by the Preacher - pretty much verbatim at End of this review - seems to have an intention for the movie viewer or, at least, is something the writer wanted to get off his chest because of what he went through).
TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN was directed by a master of low budget - and minimalism - Joseph H. Lewis.  This movie has a very basic, clean black-and-white look to it also (some cred for camera man Ray Rennahan).
Joseph Lewis has been credited with directing some of the best B-movies (again, notice small budgets) of the 1950's Guncrazy (1949), A Lady Without Passport (with Hedy Lamarr), and the very good The Big Combo (camera, John Alton) before helming the black and white western TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN starring Sterling Hayden -- who doesn't have a line until just about half-an-hour into movie!

But, I saw this on TCM some years ago.  I never forget the impression it made on me with its simple, familiar (High Noon) story and, yet, an undeniably unique and unorthodox approach (notice pre-movie credits showing clips of movie -- in reverse) with music by Gerald Fried emphasizing that trumpet! as well as original, non-Hollywood, acoustic guitar.
I do not give TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN 5 stars because it IS a B-movie that does have an acting flaw or two -- that are always apparent in quickly made B-movies.  Actress Carol Kelley suffers a hard not to laugh moment when she has to regale the ""carrying nothing but a whale harpoon..."" line as the hero walks down the street towards the big showdown.  Yep, few movies are perfect.
I STILL believe the more experienced film-goer who appreciates or admires film noir, black-and-white movies, westerns in general, and good 'movement' camera work, will appreciate another well-made B-movie by Joseph H Lewis that IS well written by Dalton Trumbo.  If it does lose some steam toward end (it does) it should not be hampered by 'all the talk' of the unusual showdown ending which has become somewhat famous.
But,  don't forget to realize the psychology of BOTH of the characters - of the rather famed showdown -  and how they have changed (to get to that point), especially, gunfighter Johnny Crale (played well by Ned Young -- the Bogart comparisons are undeniable).

Again, as mentioned in the beginning of the review, here is what the Preacher said as written by a black listed writer, Dalton Trumbo:
 ""Although we have opened with prayer
  we are not here for religious services
  there are many faiths of hope (and the)
  church edifice (has been) thrown open
  that we may freely discuss
  a most unusual situation
  on which our future and our children's future, depend""

873205,4,6304429746,"Writer Dalton Trumbo  was one of the infamous Hollywood 10, that list of 10 Hollywood screenwriters whose political leanings got them blacklisted, jailed and kicked out of a guild they helped create. Hollywood did to them what the Germans did the ""degenerate artists"" twenty years before. Trumbo was probably the best of these writers and wrote a mind boggling number of excellent scripts, from his bathtub, as he smoked through 6 packs of cigarettes with his parrot on his shoulder, cheering him on. Only such an eccentric original could have fashioned Terror in a Texas Town  (1958). Team Trumbo with B-movie maestro Joseph ""Wagon Wheel"" H. Lewis and a cast of idiosyncratic character actors and you get a peach of movie such as this.

Trumbo wasn't the only victim of the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) associated with this film. Actors Ned Young and Sterling Hayden were also called before the committee. Young was also a screenwriter. Jailhouse Rock (1957), The Defiant Ones(1958), Inherit the Wind (1960), and The Train (1964) are among his credits, most of which he wrote under pseudonyms. Young refused to cooperate with the HUAC and was blacklisted as well. Hayden caved into the committee and gave them what they wanted, which cost him much in the long run. All this has given Terror in a Texas Town a cult status as a quirky reaction to the HUAC. The reputation is well-deserved.

The film opens to George Fried's bizarre score as Swede George Hansen (Sterling Hayden) walks down a dirt road in the middle of Prairie City, Texas. George is mad as hell, he means business and he's carrying a big whaling harpoon over his shoulder to prove it. George is followed by bloodthirsty, local farmers who are mad as hell, too.

They meet up with the object of their anger; southpaw gunslinger Johnny Crale (Ned Young, uncannily resembling Bogart and dressed from head to toe in black). Johnny is ready to face and kill George. Johnny taunts George, ""You're a little too far away. Come a little bit closer. You wouldn't want to disappoint your friends. They all came here to see blood. Come a little bit closer so they can see. I want to give you a fighting chance. Five steps. One step, Hansen."" George hangs his head in shame. It seems this is something he cannot go through with.

Titles roll through a typical Lewis shot of wagon wheel spokes. The farming townspeople are being bullied and driven out by local oil baron Ed McNeil (Sebastian Cabot, projecting slimy finesse in excellent form). McNeil likes the finer things in life and that includes women, food, champagne and land ownership; but the local farmers are uncooperative when it comes to their land, which McNeil wants to mine. McNeil utilizes the talents of gunslinger Johnny to get his dirty deeds done. Pa Hansen is one of those farmers, and he is murdered by Johnny. Pa's employee, Jose (Victor Millan, also in excellent form) witnesses the murder, but his wife wants him to remain silent. At this point, Terror in a Texas Town may seem like a formulaic movie, but underneath the surface this is a bleak film, dripping in cynical parody. That becomes apparent when Pa's son, George, arrives in Prairie City after being at sea for 19 years. George is returning to help his Pa, until he learns the awful truth that his Daddy has been shot and killed. With no help from the townspeople, George intends to find out who killed his Pa and why.

Both the Sheriff and McNeil attempt to coerce George into leaving, but his stubborn refusal brings Johnny in to handle the situation. George befriends Jose and his family, who also are being threatened to leave. After Crane and McNeil's thugs beat Hansen and put him on a train out of town, Hansen walks all the way back, bloodied and more persistent than ever. Jose is inspired by Hansen and makes his stand. Millan gives a powerhouse performance as Jose when he overcomes his fear and faces Crane, knowing full well that Crane will kill him. The ruthless Crane does just that, but he is shaken by Jose's courage. Young is equally superb in this scene and, little doubt, reacted to Millan's Jose by tapping into his own courage when he faced the Hollywood inquisitors. Young makes Crane one of the most interesting, classic western villains, who can stand alongside Lee Marvin's Liberty Valance and Jack Palance's Jack Wilson. Crane's girlfriend, Molly (Carol Kelly) tells him that she stays with him because she can look up to see someone lower than herself. Molly is very attuned to irony. She sees Johnny as an anachronism, forced for years to use his left hand after his right hand was rendered useless in a gunfight. ""You're no good anymore,"" she says, hinting at something far more than a paralyzed gun hand. Johnny knows it too; he's a savage killer riddled with angst.

Aptly, George rallies support in a local church, grabs his Pa's whaling harpoon and heads to one of the strangest shoot-outs in screen history. It's an odd finale to an equally odd film and film career (it was Lewis' final film). Terror in a Texas Town arrived at the tail end of a politically troubled decade made for this American genre. It makes for a helluva showdown.

Money grubbing hotel owner McNeil (Sebastian Cabot) is in the middle of forcing the local farmers to sell him their land. When they don't cooperate their barns suddenly catch fire and they are beaten. With right hand man and gunslinger Crale (Nedrick Young) enforcing his will, no one has much of a chance standing up to him.

When land owner Sven Hanson (Ted Stanhope) attempts to do so, Crale kills him in his tracks. From then on no one attempts to prevent the sales McNeil intends. And then Svens son George (Sterling Hayden) arrives. Fresh from his time at sea hes disheartened to learn of his fathers death. He seeks answers and tries to find out what happened. And in the end he intends to face off the same threat that his father did, with or without help from the locals.

In reading on the film there is a number of things to know about what was going on behind the scenes. First off the script was written under a pseudonym by Dalton Trumbo, one of the blacklisted writers in Hollywood at the time. Young was had also been blacklisted. Director Joseph Lewis was about to retire and with this being his last film he didn't care about the standings of both men and set out to make the movie.

The film may seem like a simple tale of evil land baron taking on dirt poor farmers but it reality it was as much a metaphor of the times as the higher profile film HIGH NOON. The townspeople are being railroaded into doing something they don't want to, fearful of repercussions if they stand up to the powers that be. Only one man is willing to do so even if they won't support him.

The story is well written and offers less black and white characters than one would imagine. The character of Crale is especially interesting. Hes the bad guy, the man in the black hat, the gunslinger weve all come to associate with all things evil. And yet here, he simply wants to make enough so that he and his girlfriend and saloon gal Molly can leave and find a place of their own. The lines here between all out good and bad are blurred with the exception of McNeil.

Still, the movie felt like it moved along slowly. The low budget is apparent with sets that seem like leftovers from other productions as a cost cutting method. The photography is good one moment and washed out the next. The supporting actors do a decent enough job but nothing to write home about. In the end the story behind the scenes will make this a movie that will be sought after by film historians and lovers of westerns but not something the average viewer will rush to find.

The extras on hand make this edition shine.

FILM REVIEW

Director Joseph H. Lewis (Gun Crazy) decided to end his movie career with the flick that is on the agenda today, Terror in a Texas Town. Lewis didn't exactly quit directing but switched to directing TV shows. Im not entirely sure why he chose to get away from the big pictures, as Terror in a Texas Town was not a bad movie. Its almost certainly a B-Western with a few notable names. Its quick paced and has an interesting story.

It is possible people were put off by Sterling Haydens caricature portrayal of a Swede, George, which is a bit on the nose, but he is an enjoyable character that has you rooting for him. Nedrick Young also does an excellent job of playing the relic from the past cowboy, Crale, sent on a task to take care of some stubborn individuals who are not willing to give up their land to the fat cat millionaire who wants the oil.

From the opening moment of forecasting the standoff at the end of the film, Terror in a Texas Town is the unsophisticated western where you can turn your brain off and just have a relaxing time watching the inevitable stand off between George and Crale.

VIOLENCE

Terror in a Texas Town isn't a bloody film, as it was shot in 1958 and is black and white. There are bloodless and holeless gun wounds. Thats about it.

SEX/NUDITY

Violence isn't the only thing missing from Terror in a Texas Town. There is no sex or nudity either, which isn't surprising. We do get some nice looking women.

INTERESTING ELEMENTS

-Albeit short, the stand off was fun.
-Harpoon weapon!
-McNeils secretary.

7870825,3,6304429746,"The western genre provides cinephiles with an almost endless amount of material to mine in search of auteurist tendencies.  And at the height of its popularity, directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks, Anthony Mann and Sergio Leone offered plenty of evidence for a consistently recognizable style, tone and theme.  But the studio system isn't build to support many unique visions, and Joseph H. Lewis, whose noirish thrillers Gun Crazy (1950) and The Big Combo (1955) are triumphs of style over substance, does his best to elevate the B-movie gunslinger flick Terror in a Texas Town, an otherwise clumsy western revenge story penned by none of than blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo.

Hired by a gluttonous businessman, McNeil, (Family Affair's Sebastian Cabot) to clear off squatters from oil rich land, has-been gunslinger Johnny Crale (Nedrick Young) makes an example of out of Swedish farmer Sven Hansen, shooting him down in hopes of scaring off the other rabble-rousers.  But the arrival of the dead man's son, George Hansen (Sterling Hayden), who claims he should inherit the land, complicates both the business and personal situation to a dangerous degree.

George manages to convince the one witness to the crime, a Mexican farmer from a neighboring ranch, to come forward in hopes that Crale will be put to trial.  But with the local sheriff on McNeil's payroll too, anyone who speaks up just might be saying his or her last words.  That leaves George, an immigrant seaman with no hope of matching Crale's skill with a gun, to seek his own brand of justice...and his own weapon of choice.

Although the obvious protagonist of Trumbo's script (which makes some obvious McCarthy era connections) is George Hansen, a quiet and unassuming outsider who refuses to be bullied, the film revolves around the less likable but more interesting character of Johnny Crale.  There is tragic nobility in Young's portrayal of this leather-clad killer who knows his days are numbered (a previous gun battle cost him his hand) and starts to question his own questionable morality.  The sequence where Crale breaks the news of Sven Hansen's death to George across an empty bar table simply explodes with emotional conundrums.  Does Crale truly regret his actions...or is he enjoying the anonymity of confessing to a man who doesn't know any better?  The ambiguity of that five-minute scene is pure genius.

But the rest of Terror in a Texas Town is awful clumsy.  The movie kicks off with a strange montage of scenes pulled from later in the film, as if the audience is being brought up to speed on a serial western rather than a stand-alone film, and the acting (outside of Young and Cabot) is amateurish at best.  It all culminates in one of the most bizarre and unlikely final face-offs in the history of the western genre, which explains a good part of the film's notoriety.  But that doesn't make the final product any less awkward.  Lewis, as with his earlier films, inserts some eye-catching camera moves and almost Bergman-esque compositions (which makes Sterling Hayden's god-awful Swedish accent even more comical than it already is). His work behind the camera elevates this below-average oater into something enjoyable offbeat.

Arrow Films' Blu-ray release is a nice follow-up to their selection of spaghetti westerns of late and gets the same high marks for a crisp black-and-white hi-def transfer and supporting extras, including a lengthy introduction and discussion by Peter Stanfield who also provides a 15 minute ""visual essay,"" pointing out much of Lewis' signature touches.",1502236800,,3590,5.097269624573379
7870826,4,6304429746,"I have to confess:  when I first got the press release for TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN, I thought it was for a horror movie.  You have to admit, the title does fit perfectly for a fright flick.  But when I realized it was a Western, I launched it to it nonetheless.  After all, Arrow and MVD have rarely ever steered me in the wrong direction.

And sure enough, they produce the goods once more.

TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN is an excellent, albeit different, genre film, and its one I recommend you give a look soon.  This is not TOMBSTONE or SHANE remadeno, this is a nice little B-grade Western that offers an intriguing storyline, interesting characters, and even a social commentary or two.

I think the unusual aspects of this film are a big part of what make it so good for me.  For example, the hero is not a traditional Western good guy; hes a Swedish whalers son.  Also, the weapon he chooses to use:  a harpoon.  Who ever heard of using a harpoon in the Old West?  But it totally works for this film!

TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The picture is in black and white, but you barely notice because the story is so gripping.  I though the b&w aspect would throw me off, but it did not in the least.

The acting is very good.  I read other reviews that stated the B-grade quality of the acting was lacking.  I disagree completely.  Everybody in the cast does a great job.  Sterling Hayden, who plays the main character, George Hansen, does a stupendous job as a Swedish immigrant, from the way he talks down to his mannerisms.  And Sebastian Cabot shines as the bad guy, McNeil.

The story in TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN, as mentioned, is very interesting and, despite the fact weve seen it numerous times, it is well done and engaging.  The basic plot reminds me a bit of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, which is another reason I found the film so much fun.  But don't let its familiarity dissuade you from seeing this film; youll greatly enjoy it regardless.

TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN is a big win for me, and its a definitive feather in Arrow Academy and MVDs cap.  I love the fact Arrow Academy is preserving films like this with the Blu-ray treatment, and I cant wait to see whats on their title list for the future.  TERROR IN A TEXAS TOWN is available now.",1500854400,,2278,4.321513002364066
