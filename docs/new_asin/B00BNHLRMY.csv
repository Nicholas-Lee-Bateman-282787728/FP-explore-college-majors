8571680,5,B00BNHLRMY,"Point Lobos State Park, located on the rugged Pacific Coast just south of Carmel, California, is a microcosm of the best of the coast.  It features pine and cypress forest, rugged shorelines, a surprising amount of wildlife, great views, and great walks.  This video captures the best of its history and its present.  And yes, it really is that beautiful in person.  Worth the visit; the video is a great preview.",1480982400,,413,4.774647887323944
8571681,5,B00BNHLRMY,I'm a wanna- be/amature nature photographer who loves to spend every vacation roaming the hills and coast of Big Sur and especially Point Lobos. If you've never been there and love the outdoors you are in for a very special treat. If you can't get there the next best thing is to buy this dvd and watch it. I have several videos of the area and one day plan to produce one of my own. This dvd is a good introduction to Point Lobos /Big Sur and will surely cause you to want to go and experience the sights and sounds in person. And don't forget to take your camera!,1452643200,,565,4.1454545454545455
