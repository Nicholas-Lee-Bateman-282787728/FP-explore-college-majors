8225308,4,B000WR3NMI,"Southward Ho!, 1934 film

The film shows soldiers roasting a chicken. They chase a dispatch rider, and lost the chicken. The comic scene is followed by a song. The war is over, so its back to Texas for inherited property. Why is the ranch losing money? Who is the co-owner? Can they cooperate? ""You're dern tootin'."" The Colonel was appointed Military Governor of the district, he will maintain law and order. What kind of troops will he get? Tax collection is needed to run the government. The troops must act properly. No receipt? There is drama in seizing property for taxes. Can they organize a resistance? ""They went that way."" The search continues for the girl. Roy sings another song for entertainment.

The Colonel and his men find the cabin. Ellen can't tell. Threats are exchanged. Roy tells Denby the truth. Will there be a duel? [There is comic treatment of a gunfight, a parody of some other westerns.] Is there a lone gunman with a rifle? The military will confiscate arms (for easier oppression of the people). Will taxation be halted until the investigation? The unarmed people are easy prey for Jeffries' men. Public meetings are banned. There is another song. There is a plot to recover their arms, it works. The people defend themselves against their oppressors. There will be a happy ending for Ellen and Roy.

There is a political lesson in this western about authority, freedom, and the right to keep and bear arms. After the Great Cowboy Strike of 1883 the Big Landowners sought gun control to oppress their hired hands. This is not in schoolbook textbooks.",1468195200,,1580,4.801470588235294
