8580272,5,B00CCF7RIE,"Howzat! Kerry Packers War is an Australian sports drama genre television mini-series, which examines the beginning of World Series Cricket and its impact on the sport.

The narrative mainly follows key protagonists Kerry Packer and John Cornell and their vision to change the face of cricket. The story depicts challenges they faced and the successes they achieved.

Set in the late 1970s notable effort was made with costume and hairstyles to take the viewer back to the time. Some classic tunes of the era also provided an impressive soundtrack.

The quality of acting was praiseworthy as the cast was credible with plenty of personality.

The bonus feature, which consists of the 1998 documentary marking the 20th Anniversary of World Series Cricket, provides the viewer with insights from numerous people who were part of it.

All in all its an Aussie gem well worth watching.
