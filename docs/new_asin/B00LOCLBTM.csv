6495062,5,B00LOCLBTM,"Annie Oakley: The Complete Series features TVs first female heroine at a time when most kids shows were headed by male stars (Superman, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, The Lone Ranger, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Zorro). Gail Davis, 5 2 and 95 pounds, portrayed the title character. Annie was a crack shot and a bane to bad men who found themselves in her hometown of Diablo, where she lived with her kid brother, Tagg (Jimmy Hawkins). Deputy Lofty Craig (Brad Johnson) was her boyfriend, and her uncle, Luke MacTavish, was the seldom-seen town sheriff.

Gail Davis was discovered by Gene Autry, who featured her in nearly 20 of his movies and 30 of his own programs episodes, and then spun her off into this series of her own, which was produced by his company. A good rider and trick shot, she performed in Autrys traveling rodeo as well. Davis once remarked, So far as Im concerned, Im going to be Annie Oakley for the rest of my born days.

The real Annie Oakley lived from 1859 to 1926 and was an exhibition sharpshooter for Buffalo Bill and other traveling shows. She traveled around the world, and once shot a cigarette from the mouth of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Annie of the TV series was less worldly and wasn't in show business.

The show ran originally from 1954 to 1957. This set contains 11 DVDs with all 81 episodes. Bonus extras include a booklet with episode guide; photo galleries; original commercials with Davis as Annie; the original pilot, Bulls Eye, featuring Billy Gray as Tagg (Gray would go on to star in Father Knows Best); and Pig-Tails & Six-Shooters: The Making of TVs Annie Oakley, a new documentary featuring interviews with Terrie Davis (Gail Davis daughter), Western historian Rob Word, and an archival interview with Gail Davis.",1416787200,23,1754,4.7254901960784315
6495063,5,B00LOCLBTM,"A wonderful release from VCI. ""Annie Oakley"" from Gene Autry's Flying A Productions was one of my favorite TV westerns from the '50s. Gail Davis and Jimmy Hawkins are both great in their roles and Brad Johnson is a whirlwind in the action scenes. The fistfights in this series are some of the best with Johnson doing his own stuntwork. The later episodes include some re-use of action scenes from earlier in the series as a cost saver. The supporting casts are chock full of ""B-western"" and TV series regulars like Harry Lauter, Walter Reed, Stanley Andrews, William Fawcett and others. Future TV stars like Fess Parker and Alan Hale Jr. show up as well.
Disc #11 features the original TV pilot with Billy Gray as Annie's brother and a nice documentary on Gail Davis and the series produced by Ballyhoo Productions. My favorite part of the extras are a collection of the commercials that the cast produced for the show's advertisers.
Now if someone would release my other favorite TV series, ""Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin"" in its original form and not the butchered re-edited version currently airing on Antenna TV",1415232000,16,1111,4.852631578947369

6495076,5,B00LOCLBTM,"I was delighted when i saw the TV  series offered for sale for the entire series.  This is a Gene Autry produced show.  Anything produced by Gene Autrys Flying ""A"" production company gets my vote of confidence.  I noted that Gail Davis enterprises produced this package for sale.  A very good move on her part.  Even though this was classed as a children's show it did teach the values of life and the difference between good and bad to all ages who watched the show.  This DVD was put together in a super packaging.  I definitely recommend this DVD set for all collectors who like westerns of this type.  My recommendation to all collectors is to add it to their collections.",1424044800,8,676,4.520661157024794

6495078,5,B00LOCLBTM,"I was born too late to see these shows during their original run but a few years ago I watched some of them with my young daughter when they were rerun on the Lonestar channel.  I found them to be surprisingly good and she loved them so I was very happy to be able to get the full series on dvd.  We are extremely pleased; these shows are a lot of fun; there's lots of action, plenty of suspense and even some humour.  Gail Davis is delightful in the Annie Oakley role; she is just what a young woman should be: bright, brave, kind and considerate, resourceful and very beautiful.  It's even fun to see the same guest stars appearing over and over again in different roles.  Sometimes the shows are a bit repetitive but I don't mind; you have to remember that they were aimed at 6 - 10 year olds and were watched once a week instead of three or four at a time as we do now.  The shows have been remastered; the pictures are bright and clear, probably better than they were in the fifties.  Apparently a lot of people contributed to making such a fine presentation of these old shows; it was obviously a labour of love so we owe them a debt of thanks.  Overall this series is all you could ask for if you like old westerns, especially those aimed at children.",1422316800,18,1258,4.2343096234309625

8667176,1,B00LOCLBTM,"'Annie Oakley', (Gail Davis) was a heroine of mine as a child.  As a child, I only watched the show to see her ride and shoot.  I ignored everything else.  I've been watching 'Yancy Derringer"" and 'Wanted Dead or Alive', and thought to watch 'Annie Oakley'.  To sum up, either of the other shows are more egalitarian as to gender, have good story lines, well-choreographed fight scenes, and humor.

As 'Annie' is portrayed, she is a ball-buster.  As Deputy Sheriff 'Lofty' is played, he is an impotent droid.  The Uncle - the rarely-scene Sheriff, should have been out of the law enforcement business about 30 years prior.  He is unlikeable.  All the characters, save for little brother Tagg, who is smart, intuitive, competent, and logical, and he is, what, 10 years old or so?, are so unlikeable, it is hard to believe they could be made so unlikeable,  I don't react well when I read that someone has written that someone was ""stupid.""  'Annie', and 'Lofty' are the personification of that qualifier.

'Annie' could have been portrayed as a genuine Western woman.  There were plenty of them in history, and just generally known.  In one episode, this 'Annie' puts on 'women's clothing' in the form of a low-bodice fancy dress, in order to seduce a bad man into changing his ways.  And that just about sums it all up.  The show is hideous, and, since I'm no longer 7 year old, there isn't enough sharp-shooting, or trick riding, or self-done stunts by Davis, to compensate.  I read somewhere, and it may not be true, that Gina Davis was embarrassed about being a ""tomboy"" when growing up.  As though, riding a horse, playing sports, climbing trees, being an expert markswoman, was something to apologize for.  This is maddening, if true. The shows are downright shamefully poor.  Yes.  Jimmy Hawkins' 'Tagg' is the only glue that held this show together.",1525564800,,1856,4.773584905660377

8667178,4,B00LOCLBTM,"I enjoyed reliving a favorite program from my childhood. The video quality is less than ideal, which is typical of videos from that era, but is certainly watchable. I really enjoyed the bonus disc that explores the life of actress Gail Davis and provides additional background about the show itself.",1503014400,,299,5.0
8667179,5,B00LOCLBTM,"Annie Oakley 's 81 black and white 25 minute television episodes are not about the historical character at the Oakley but rather a fictional one created for this series. From January 1954 to February 1957 in syndication, for a total of 81 black and white episodes, each 25 minutes long. ABC TV ran reruns from 1959 to 1965. This secured 5'1"" actress/trick horse rider, Gail Davis as TVs Annie Oakley for all time.
The series was produced by Davis' lifetime pal, Singing Cowboy powerhouse actor, Gene Autry.
 Annie Oakley rides a huge gelding palomino  named Target ( little known fact, Target was played by Roy Rogers' horse Trigger).

Annie and Tagg lived in the town of Diablo, Arizona. Their uncle, Luke MacTavish, was the sheriff. For odd reasons he was frequently away. This left the job up to the man who seems to be Annie's boyfriend, towering Lofty Craig!

Early film crews who were now older and no longer working for the big studios, shut the program. Therefore the camera set ups were reminiscent of those of the 30s  rather than the 50s. Thus, the program has that movie serial look. We don't see many close ups here. To bad because Davis was kept busy through her career due to her good looks and spunky character.

Annie wore fringed cowgirl dress outfits, and her blonde hair (with the exception of the first episode), was braided in pigtails.

Many of the films sold on DVD derive from old discarded 16mm tv station syndicated copies. Are these copies from the 35mm masters? If so, this would be the set to have. Reviews say that the audio is better than other copies out there.

Familiar guest stars:

Later, the voice of the Lost In Space robot B9, Dick Tufeld appeared in fifteen programs. A very familiar face in westerns, William Fawcett, prior to his role as Pete Wilkey in Fury, was in seven shows. Also western actor on screen, radio, and tv, James Best appeared. Dwayne's older brother, Darryl Hickman was in one show as was "" the Skipper,"" Alan Hale, Jr. So was Davy Crockett/Daniel Boone actor Fess Parker. Others included Slim Pickens, Denver Pile, Lyle Talbot, fan favorite Lee Van Cleef, and Denver Pyle.

Annie's brother, Tagg in the pilot film was played by later Father Knows Best son,  Billy Gray. Jimmy Hawkins, who later gained fame as Mary's boyfriend on the Donna Reed show, grew up here as Tagg.",1494720000,4,2334,4.6821515892420535
