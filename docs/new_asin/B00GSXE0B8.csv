6111646,5,B00GSXE0B8,"This whole watchers series is fantastic but this one, number 7 is the best so far. You need to see this and make up your own mind. This DVD is filled with some of the best evidences you will sever see about the UFO/Alien phenomena. You will see Visual evidence and interviews with leafing experts in many fields. L.A. and his team go to Mexico where there is a UFO epidemic taking place. You will be astounded at the Video and also the Physical Evidence found. SEE The Found ""Orb"" it is an amazing object, see what it is made of and hear the speculation of what its purpose is. Learn About ""Mother Ships"" seen over Russia. Learn about other hard evidences left behind, such as hand prints (small with 4 fingers) and radiation.  Learn what the Vatican has to do with all of this, you will be astounded at what high authorities onside the Church are saying openly an Publicly. (Why don't you know about it, there seems to be a media blackout in the US except on the agenda driven History channel with there Ancient gods as aliens Bunk). We also see these ""Objects"" that some think are marian apparitions which definitely fit into the whole UFO/Alien endgame. You will Learn about the Moon and that there is a coverup by NASA taking place, See the In COLOR photos that NASA won;t allowed out, see proof of NASA photoshopping photos of the moon. Learn about the SPACE FORCE and base planed to be on the moon. You will see Highlights from the Citizens committee on UFOs and Alines and be astounded at what you hear.

What about MJ-12 and Truman and were Deals made wiht the ""Devil"" hear the speculation hear. Also how does John Pedestra (who has called fro all UFO an Alien Government files be released) fit into all of this. What is the government hiding? Find out hear.  You will also hear about what we Christians believe this is all about (Shining Ones, and Great Deception) and if you have never heard that take its a must hear. Is DISCLOSURE coming? and Why? will it lead to a One World Government? and a One World Religion? One thing is for sure the Alien Ufo Phenomena is bringing about a change in peoples beliefs, are we being set up for a GREAT Deception?  Examine the evidence, its hear in the Watchers series. This is a MUST SEE DVD.",1386892800,53,2366,4.447004608294931
6111647,1,B00GSXE0B8,"Silly video filled with goofy examples for evidence, plenty of shaky-cam and outrageous conjecture.

Maybe the government hired them to make the supposed UFO phenomenon look rediculous. If so, they nailed it.",1498348800,,208,5.5
6111648,1,B00GSXE0B8,"The documentary maker himself seems to be quite credulous. He keeps throwing the phrase 'wow' and seems surprised at all events which can have simple alternate explanations. For example, he considers microscopic tubular structures in mexcio's sphere as evidence of ET. The microscopic world is far more structured than the macro world, the tubular structures should not surprise anyone. Also, too much of time is spent on religion and vatican.
There are much better documentaries like 'Out of the Blue' and 'I know what I saw'. They do not insult viewer's intelligence like this one and present credible testimonies/arguments which currently have no alternate explanations.",1497916800,2,673,5.419047619047619
6111649,3,B00GSXE0B8,"Well lots of theories for sure. But my question is..if there are so many UFO sightings, how is it there is only camera evidence. I want to to see hard evidence like that objects in that guys leg explained. If you believe heavy into the end of world, this this might be for you. But if Aliens wanted to take our world over and they have technology to get here, then I believe there would be nothing to stop them.",1497916800,,411,4.15
6111650,2,B00GSXE0B8,"You know before starting that anything that has enough of a budget to make it here to Amazon, has to have disinformation in it, but this is still nauseating.  The UFO videos are nice, and there are good things  about this, but the who thing about ET being evil, the antichrist coming from ET, and other such things are horrible.  Dr Greer warns of plots to create fear of ET and to one day create a fake alien invasion that we can then use to declare yet another war.

While ET presence has always been here, there is a reason things started changing roughly around WWII.  That is because our nuclear capability started then.  From foo fighters, to Roswell to the knowledge Germans were given, this was all meant to slow us down or to dissuade us from the use of such weapons.  The intentions were never something that our leaders had to  guess at for long.  They were flat out told over and over and over again about what ET expects.  WE are the aggressors and the violent ones, not them.  We came very very close to nuclear war on numerous occasions, our launch codes were even set to all zeros for a good while, yet we did not get in an all out nuclear war.  This was not an accident, and it was not luck. No, instead of hearing about these events, and from people like Dr Greer, we hear about how violent ET are going to be the antichrist, and about how our wonderful leaders are right to be cautious about the menacing ET.  We are also not told about how the fake UFOs, the cattle mutilations, and the abductions are almost certainly from our own government than the real ET.

At least present something from the other viewpoint, not just these maddening lies about ET.",1497744000,4,1674,4.375404530744337

6111652,4,B00GSXE0B8,"This was an extremely detailed and thought- provoking documentary that opened my mind to new ways of thinking about this subject. It did not see the subject through a solitary lens, which added to the credibility of the production. Therefore, recommended.",1497484800,,255,5.2439024390243905
6111653,2,B00GSXE0B8,"Underwhelming. Some interesting facts, but the interviews become repetitive and boring. It also slowly builds up to what is essentially a RELIGIOUS documentary, with talk of the extraterrestrials as fallen angels and of Lucifer's coming, etc, and interviews of doomsday Christian believers.",1497225600,2,290,5.928571428571429
6111654,3,B00GSXE0B8,This is pretty boring. yessss ufos are real. that's about the crux of it.. Most people know this already I think.,1496880000,,113,4.428571428571429
6111655,1,B00GSXE0B8,"Why are all of the videos of UFOs, even the ""best evidence we have,""  blurry? Why are the Ufologists in films like this always older white guys who talk like the teacher in school who put everyone to sleep?
But this film's problem isn't so much the lack of evidence, it's that the narrative and presentation are DULL. Skip it - watch the X-Files instead.",1496880000,4,354,4.446153846153846
6111656,4,B00GSXE0B8,"This is an interesting show but it includes a lot of details and video that are available from other sources. As a result there is not a lot new here but it is a good overview of what the UFO groups have been disclosing.

If you are new to this area then it is worth watching as it can give you a good synopsis of the topic. I rated it as a 4  star and as a short film that newcomers might be interested in. It puts a lot of theories and data into an 82 minute film.",1496793600,,466,3.7448979591836733
6111657,1,B00GSXE0B8,"I can't watch ANYTHING UFOTV does because of the annoying background music they insist on adding to every-damned-thing they do. It distracts from the content, and maybe that is the purpose of it. Perhaps they intend to present information in an unpalatable format to minimize the number of viewers.",1496620800,3,298,5.1020408163265305
6111658,1,B00GSXE0B8,"Watching this movie is a complete stretch of the imagination.  You don't know whether to laugh or be sad at the stupidity of the individuals involved.  It's sad that they appear to be reasonably intelligent people but you have to laugh at some the stuff coming out of their mouths.  I was ok with it all and in fact was enjoying it until they started interpreting  God's word to the point that the miracles God created wasn't from God at all but aliens at work. HOGWASH!!  Can't believe someone would commit such heresy on camera.  As if that wasn't enough they expect people to believe people who were abducted floated through wall,windows, or ceiling. Well, how else are you going to explain how they got out of a locked room or house. LOL.  Also has anyone ever reported seeing someone being abducted.  Surely, by now, someone would have seen a UFO hovering over a house and someone being elevated out of it. The movie is interesting but only to the point of if you need a good laugh.",1496534400,3,987,4.50561797752809
6111659,5,B00GSXE0B8,"Science with Detail., interesting to watch.  Caught my mind that I want to learn more.  How has our country/world gone from black and white TV's to handheld computer devices in our hands, in less time than sailing ships verse steam ships.  The detail.  Look at the detail presented.  I'm looking at my cell phone, which is a small computer.  I see hundreds of years of carriages, then we get to steam, and ? a blossom.  Really?  If you look at the chain of events they don't mathematically align.  To present Day.  Black and White TV to Color, then so forth....The pace of increase is higher  as we proceed.  This is interesting, to see.",1496448000,4,637,4.539823008849558

6111662,1,B00GSXE0B8,"No stars for this so called documentary. Aliens living among us, in cahoots with a shadowy government! Saw that  ! Whole series of X-Files. The man claiming abduction and implant. First off the xray is done with him wearing clothes. Second,  if it is under his skin no-one asked him about any accidents he had, injuries he included. Maybe he worked in a machine shop and that's a piece of metallic debris from a milling machine. But this show won't ask those questions because it shines a light on their bias agenda. Those machines that man uses on that guys leg to proof his point, I don't know what they're used for and if they're real. If I had an alien implant in me I would want it removed.  But nope that didn't happen.  Also calling the Bible ancient text is ridiculous. It's not. And believing aliens are demons luring you away from God, ludicrous!  And I believe in aliens and ufos but this would make a believer a skeptic. Oh and the videos are grainy and shaky....of course. Some balloons insects and a lot of birds.",1496275200,5,1027,4.470588235294118

6111665,1,B00GSXE0B8,"Please, the first 10 minutes showed a shaky picture of a UFO space ship that was near the moon, yet they could see people/aliens in the window?  Hahahaha!  Okay, the narrator explained that the camera was on a tripod and had a 600x lens.  But, if the camera was on a tripod, why is the video shaking?  So fake.  People, come on!!!!",1496016000,2,331,4.274193548387097
6111666,1,B00GSXE0B8,"I feel like it deserves maybe one extra start just for it's honest efforts.  I'm genuinely open minded and curious about UFO phenomena and alleged alien encounters and am eager to hear about any good evidence to that effect.  That made the part about Dr. Lier very interesting, and the tests he conducts seem pretty legit, having some of these ""implants"" checked by a scientifically legitimate university laboratory, but they stop short of sharing any clear conclusions.  This makes it simply some slightly high profile, anecdotal, even if compelling, evidence.  ""Hey this guy thinks he was abducted and he has a thingy in his leg that is mysterious in origin"".  Great.  Why were we not given a clear prognosis from the lab in the earlier half of the film?
Then, all credibility goes out the window when they start submitting the official stance of the Diocese as though grown men who believe Santa Claus, the desert edition, was sent to Earth by Invisible Bearded Jealous and Wrathful Santa to be sacrificed to absolve our sins somehow gives extra legitimacy to the story.  Several more fully cognizant adults continue to pawn off a bunch of prophetic biblical boogeyman stories as ""evidence"" to support truly outrageous claims about alien visitation and their sinister intentions.  The host is fully invested in this narrative as well so no real effort is made to tease out fact from fantasy and there is no reasoned tempering of the wild speculation with any sober reflection on what we can or cannot reasonably speculate.
Nonetheless it's still interesting to watch if you have any interest in this kind of stuff.  I do, so I didn't simply turn it off when all the ludicrous Bible/UFO conflation started to emerge.  Part of my interest is in the topic generally, but I'm also interested in what people out in the world think and why, no matter how outrageous.  After all, outrageous beliefs have always played a major role in affecting human society, and still do to this day, for good and, I would argue, mostly for ill.  So from that standpoint it's very engaging as an exercise in people watching.  If you're into that you should totally watch this!

PS: And I don't mean people watching in a cynical, sneering, arrogant way, as tempting as that may be, but out of genuine curiosity; a desire to understand.",1495843200,4,2314,4.8106060606060606
6111667,1,B00GSXE0B8,"Phony beyond belief. Balloons and Cruise ship lights. People who go on trips to film UFO's and always get footage, yeah right.

The worst part was the Vatican lingo. The Vatican doesn't employ ""demonologists"". A monsignor is not part of the Vatican hierarchy it is a simple honorary title for a priest that gives him no more power over any other priest. In fact, some monsignors work as subordinates of priests. Just a bunch of really crappy information and a really bad documentary.

6111670,4,B00GSXE0B8,"I'm not one to believe in aliens, even more so for bigfoots. I watched this on the title ""Watchers"" and it caught my attention and curiosity. I felt this documentary was done well and the sources they quoted and included people from the government helped authenticate their theories. I did not find this ""preachy"" as some reviews said, which I found their reviews subjective and not objective at all. I find those reviewers to lack integrity and short-sighted.
I am a person of faith and I do believe in ""angels of darkness"" as I do of ""angels of God"" (aka: Sons of God). Based on scripture as well as other historical documents(non-religious) mention these entities to be demons. (I don't remember this documentary citing satan, but they did make reference to demons) These would be 1/3 of the angels that fell with lucifer who fell from grace.
The Word also describes these demonic entities as ""angels of light"", and therein lies the deception..What deception? What is the purpose of these entities? Mankind is already seeing and hearing the rhetoric of , ""We are our own god, We map out our own destiny. Our lives is what we make it. we don't need a religion to define us"". Sound familiar?
I think this documentary was insightful and left it up to viewers to look into things with an open mind and educate themselves. So don't be afraid if that education includes a study bible and strong's concordance.",1495670400,15,1406,4.719512195121951

Simply to approach it from a practical perspective. Any alien coming to earth would have had to travel what? 10,000 light years? What kind of tech and life span must that require? And then to bumble and bounce around in earth's atmosphere in their ship for poor photographers to get blurry, bouncing pictures of? Right. And I have a bridge to sell you.
Simply put, watching this made by people suffering from delusions, for people suffering from delusions is kind of pathetic. And worse, those fleecing those suffering from delusions by making fake films and books, pathetic.",1495238400,2,782,4.887218045112782
6111673,5,B00GSXE0B8,Have watched a few of this type documentary and have to say this one has been the most thought provoking of any I have watched.

6111684,5,B00GSXE0B8,"Those of us familiar with L.A. Marzulli will recognize a lot of the facts and information in this movie, but there is enough new material, amazing UFO video coverage, and information to make it worth watching. Each Watchers movie increases in production value and I always look forward to the next in the series.

The negative reviews of this movie tend to be more about bored, clueless people commenting on their own belief systems, (ie. ""This is BS,"" or ""Same old stuff in a different wrapper.""  As a whole they have no educated, intelligent or specific complaint. They are lazy reviewers who don't know how to express a valuable, insightful or useful opinion, so ignore them. They're trolls.

UFOs are real, are increasing, and will - as the Bible says, make their appearance known - ""Men's hearts will fail them for fear of what is coming upon the earth."" I have witnessed, alone and in a group, and as part of a family, UFOs. My uncle was one of the men who transported the bodies from Roswell, and as a former police officer I was taught in the police academy UFOs are real. As a Christian, I actually read and study the Bible and believe it to be true. If you are NOT a Christian, or a believer in UFOs, it's worth your while to watch and think about. If you don't like being confronted with evidence that makes you scared, uncomfortable or incredulous and you don't want to consider an alternative point of view - go find a Disney flick, or some mindless sit-com series to watch. If you are someone who is INTELLIGENT, curious, open to hearing someone else's point of view and experience, then buy or rent or watch this flick.

Of all the UFO footage I've seen, the clips in this are by far the most astounding. That L.A. Marzulli continues to educate, film, interview, speak and appear in front of millions of people, many of whom are morons who think because THEY don't believe it, it's not real, is a testament to his faith and research.",1493078400,7,1948,4.5413105413105415
6111685,3,B00GSXE0B8,"While exploring the spiritual aspect of the UFO phenomenon and introducing a useful balance to the positive spin on it that has been so much a part of most, if not all, alien productions was an area that I enjoyed I was disappointed by the production value and the editing. I felt that the content was interrupted and not adequately supported by the visuals and it is apparent to me that the monetary investment was very low. The organization of the segments was also somewhat confusing and the opinion and essentially the synopsis was awkwardly placed almost in the middle but not at the end as it should have been. I think that a little more work and editing would bring this film to perfection.
However, with all of its flaws any Christians watching this film will have support for their beliefs that, while the phenomenon is real, it is real in a spiritual sense. I would encourage anyone who is not a Christian to watch this as it will introduce them to the concerns and criticisms that Christians have of the phenomenon.",1491264000,,1026,4.612021857923497

6111768,5,B00GSXE0B8,"How do I describe the Watchers series for newcomers? LA Marzulli and his team come from a Christian worldview to investigate, document, and provide meaningful context for various supernatural events of high strangeness. They also are clamoring as Watchmen on the Wall to alert people to these events and especially their fellow Christians in the Church.

I will begin by mentioning that the production values have continued to steadily improve throughout the course of the series. You would be hard pressed to find a crew of film makers that know how to stretch a dollar out more creatively than these folks do. I must make special mention of Richard Shaws talents behind the camera. He has a wonderful eye and that has been readily apparent since the start of the series.

Now on to the most important aspect which is, of course, the substance:

I appreciate that great care is taken to present all sides of a given issue. The crew always brings in many people from across the spectrum of worldviews and relevant professions with respectable to lofty credentials. This is done in an effort to get as much clarity on a subject as possible. By doing this they are also able to fairly compare and contrast the differing worldviews take on a given subject while also finding the points of agreement.

Often times I see the accusation of sensationalism thrown around. The subject matter by its very nature is indeed sensational. There is no way to avoid it. Anyone that is actually familiar with LA Marzullis work know that he and his crew handle the subject matter very responsibly. Great care is taken to separate known fact from theories and opinions.

The main topic of Watchers 7 is the UFO Phenomenon and how much physical evidence exists thus far as it pertain to the phenomenon, what it is, and what it all means. Coming away from this work I daresay impressive inroads have been made. The thesis is that the UFO phenomenon is largely demonic or interdimensional in nature as opposed to real space aliens. Furthermore that this phenomenon is part and parcel of a much larger great deception setup as referenced in the Bible in  Matthew 24 where even the elect could be deceived if that were possible.

The Watchers 7 DVD is 83 minutes long. Time and budget only allow so much to make it on to one of these DVDs so thankfully that is where the book Further Evidence comes in.

The book picks up where Watchers 7 leaves off and it also allows further expansion of detail on the subjects in the movie. The book also covers several other topics that did not make it into the documentary so its well worth it. Its high stock glossy and full of colored photos as well.  I highly recommend getting the DVD and book together as a package deal. They are well worth it. They complement each other beautifully.

The lineup of experts in their respective fields is very broad and impressive and includes scientists, theologians, journalists, and top UFO experts in and out of the United States. For example, Dr. David Jacobs is well-known in the UFO research circles as is Mexicos Jaime Maussan. Maussan shares some footage that is truly jaw dropping. I realize that a number of these people are controversial in their own rights and Im reasonably sure the production crew was careful to vet anything that was said or thrown their way before putting it out there.  It just has to come down to people using their own discernment and Christians being Bereans and matching things against the Scriptures ultimately.

It boggles the mind that there really is as much documentation as there is and yet it gets so little attention or respect although the winds of change have been blowing slowly but surely on that. It certainly doesnt help things that there is so much counterfeit and fraud perpetrated. The American media is notorious for making light of UFOs in particular. In contrast, the Mexican media has had no qualms airing footage and taking the subject matter more seriously.

One of a number of criticisms I see come up is the idea that people like LA might be reading too much into or eisegeting Matthew 24 with like the days of Noah and what that means. Furthermore we look at Luke 21 where days of Lot also get thrown on the table. We all agree that rampant runaway sin definitely was the hallmark of both of those days but is that really it? It doesnt seem that weighty to merit those two blazing neon signs from Jesus Himself. I think the work LA does is starting to show us that it means all bets are off. No, it doesnt mean we will have 20 foot giants again but it does mean we have a genetic manipulation issue, which these UFO abductions clearly have as a theme, and we also have a growing supernatural manifestation issue.

Another concern that I see get mentioned is people expressing concerns about some of the people LA and the crew cross paths with and may even do some collaborative work with to get to the bottom of something. Just because you interview someone or work on a professional level towards a common goal for a documentary with someone does not automatically mean you endorse and agree with everything that person says or stands for. You couldn't make a documentary at all if that were really the case. Frankly, you couldn't get along in the real word at that rate.

As I write this, LA is running a deal right off of his own website at www.lamarzulli.net. Hit the store option. Prophecy in the News is also offering a compelling package with these important materials. Christians especially need to be armed with this critical knowledge.

I really want to see and hear a skeptic sit down and watch the DVD at least and see what answers they can come up with.

It is very sobering to hear seculars and Christians alike agree on certain broad common denominators and all agree that what we are seeing here is not benevolent and it is not going away. It means something and has all the hallmarks of something that is going to reach a pinnacle soon. There most certainly is a broad consensus of agreement on that.

I want to offer a few comments on each topic covered on Watchers 7. Lets begin with the possible moon coverup. This was an interesting and suggestive segment that featured a film maker named Jose Escamilla.

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0260181/

I am not familiar with him or his work although his work can easily be found on tlbnfilms.com or $2 rentals and such. I would like to see his film Celestial which was subject of this segment before offering too much more commentary on this area but suffice to say I would not be surprised if there is more than meets the eye so far as the moon goes. I definitely can agree with the part about the media peddling the idea for a long time that the moons color is white and gray as opposed to the more tan color that it really is and that clearly shows up in early photos from the late 60s. Why have they done this? What I don't feel as confident about signing off on yet is the idea that potentially there are structures on the moon that have been blacked out although the one item mentioned at the end of the segment seemed pretty suggestive.

I will make it a point to watch Celestial in the near future and update these comments as necessary. Nothing would surprise me here so Im not trying to imply anything negative in Mr. Escamillas direction. Incidentally Doug Woodward has released a new book called the Lying Wonders of Mars which goes into the same broad direction: More than meets the eye and potentially a cover up of sorts so far as our outer space information goes.

The next segment involved further research on the implant chips found in certain UFO abductees. My heart goes out to the gentleman that came in as a patient of Dr. Leirs to have a chip removed and was generous and gracious enough to allow the film crew to follow the progress while protecting his identity. I have great sympathy for this abductee victim and others like him. I cant even imagine what it must be like. The chip was putting out a 7/10 on a Gauss meter while still in this gentlemans leg. As a point of reference the video camera itself was 10/10. Thats an impressive piece of tech along with the 333 Ghz transmission level.  See: http://lamarzulli.wordpress.com/tag/great-deception/

What are these chips and where do they come from? Whats the point? Are we looking at precursors or prototypes of the eventual Mark of the Beast mentioned in the book of Revelation? No one knows for sure but the question certainly seems valid given the technology and given its apparent use. The characteristics and behavior of this chip and how it interacts and connects with the human body are also worth noting.

Just since Watchers 7 was released there have already been further developments:

http://lamarzulli.wordpress.com/2014/01/06/watchers-8-exclusive-implant-removal-with-dr-leir/

This incident and what occurred here would tend to underscore a quality to these chips that begs further questioning and scrutiny. There is no way to be dogmatic about this but overall I have a lot of sympathy for the idea that these chips might be Mark of the Beast precursors given all of these characteristics.

For the folks that think abductions are either just sleep paralysis and/or everything just happens in peoples minds and there is absolutely no physical element to any of this whatsoever? How do you explain all this? Whats going on here? Where did this chip come from? What is that chip? We don't have anything remotely as high-tech as that chip is on the streets. A chip is a physical item! Why was it implanted in this person and others like him?

There is another segment involving some footage that Dr. Leir took of a UFO over water several years ago. This footage has been vetted and deemed legitimate. It is jaw dropping footage to the point you can almost make out moving creatures in the ship if you look very carefully and slow the footage down. This footage has been verified as legitimate. I want to know what the skeptics answer for this is and I want to know what the people who say none of this is physical have to say about it as well? This is smoking gun footage. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUEjeYn5Obg&feature=player_embedded

That is the original version. For Watchers 7 this footage was completely cleaned up and remastered in high def to pull out as much detail as possible. Even in its original form I think people can at least appreciate what happened here. I highly recommend having your pause button ready to go when watching that footage so you can really study it and take it all in. Run it frame by frame and see what you can make of it.

Many Christians ask what does any of this have to do with the Bible, the Gospel, the end times and the rest of it? These are fair questions. I would recommend they study passages such as Genesis 6, 2 Thessalonians 2:8-10, Matthew 24, Luke 21, and Ephesians 2:2. By all means read the entire chapter and as much as you want for the sake of context. Im simply citing the verses I want to emphasize here.

I have no doubts that much of the current UFO phenomenon that gets detailed in these works is literal Ephesians 2:2 in action and also a set up for the eventual full-fledged 2 Thessalonians 8-10 concept when the Antichrist rolls out. We are seeing the warm up right now. I certainly know and understand that some UFO sightings are man-made and there has also been and continues to be much fraud that muddies the waters. Watchers 7 and the companion book focus on the clear super/preternatural aspects.

When Jesus talks about it being like the days of Noah and Lot per Matthew 24 and Luke 21 we need to ask ourselves what was so distinctive and awful about those respective time periods. Rampant sin? Sure, but weve always had that. What else? I think it leads back to Genesis 6.  I have a hard time trying to find any other distinct elements past that.

This is a pot that is boiling over now. The key question here is: What sort of lie and great deception would be so compelling that it could deceive the elect if that were possible?  I think this production and its companion book go a long way to showing people at least one aspect of it.

There are some disturbing descriptions of creatures in the book of Revelation that may be more literal than any of us wanted to previously think about. You need go no further than mainstream media to see plenty of reports of lab experimentation, chimeras, and strange creatures washing up on shore. What is chilling is these are the declassified and carefully trickled out for public dissemination items. Imagine what is still classified. Why is there such an overt theme of hybridization when it comes to the UFO phenomenon? The answer is: Its all connected to Matthew 24 and Luke 21 when Jesus described the season leading up to the Second Coming as both the Days of Noah and the Days of Lot. That means all bets are off.

I greatly appreciate that LA and his team have taken the extra time and effort to provide detailed companion books to coincide with the Watchers DVD releases. This kind of subject matter demands it. This concept started on Watchers 6 with the On the Trail of the Nephilim book. I highly recommend people pick that set up if they haven't already. I am happy that apparently that was the start of a planned trend as we have DVD-book combo again here and if I understand correctly Watchers 8 will have On the Trail of the Nephilim 2 as a companion. Excellent!

There sadly are many in the church right now that simply are not prepared to deal with these sorts of phenomena and have no answers. Some will even scoff, mock, and ridicule those of us that pay attention and try to warn others about what is going on here. 2 Peter 3:3.

Starting with the Vatican on down, if an alien mothership shows up or Obama announces a careful disclosure one day in the near future, its a game changer and you will have many in the church who will adjust their theology because the Bible didn't give us all the details.

Those of us who will be jumping up and down like maniacs warning people that these space brothers aren't our friends will be branded heretics and dealt with accordingly. Thats at least part of the eventual great deception and Im convinced of it. It will be part and parcel of something even bigger that will ultimately include and very likely usher in the Antichrist. Its clear that this deception is and has been beautifully planned for thousands of years.

This video and its companion book will take you step by step through all of these things with responsibility, care, broad consensus of scholars, Scriptural backbone, and absolutely in high style thanks to Mr. Shaw.

Watchers 7 won the Best UFO Film and Peoples Choice awards for Watchers 7 at the UFO Congress / EBE Film Festival near Phoenix AZ.

Hats off to them for this accomplishment. Its well earned.  The more important item I would like to draw your attention to is LA Marzulli explaining directly what the Watchers series is all about and why they do this work.

  For those of you who read this blog you may remember the post a while back about our implant extraction and how the implant was being hidden until I prayed and a power greater than those who were manipulating the implant showed up. Heres the link to the post! http://wp.me/ph2yr-406

  What these folks need to grasp is there is a power that is greater than the one that has deceived them.  There is a way out, a passage to freedom, a way to stop the abductions and have a normal life.

  In closing todays post:  I believe there is a supernatural component to the UFO phenomena and the abductions that often go hand in hand.  I also believe there is hope for those who have been taken all their lives.  There is a power that is greater than the ones who take without asking and His name is Yashua/Jesus.  Unfortunately, many folks have been so hurt by the church that they identify Jesus with what they experienced in church!  Added to this is many pastors who are ill equipped to deal with the abduction phenomena and will dismiss it out of hand as a mental problem.

  However, we have real evidenceas seen by the implant removalthat the phenomena is real and certainly not going away.  These people need to meet the real Jesus, the one who is able to stand in the gap and deliver them from the abductions, sexual experimentation, and the implanting of objects in their bodies, and bring them to a place of deliverance.  I state this not from a rote point of view but from one who has led people out of the UFO/abduction phenomena and watched Himthe one who is greater set the captives free!

One detail he didn't mention in this write up but did mention on his radio show recently was that several of the people who witnessed all of this came up to him afterward and essentially conceded that their worldview was now challenged and that they now were forced to concede that there was more than meets the eye to all of this and very likely some sort of supernatural component. This is a very important aspect of what this work is about. Pray for these folks, too.

Exposing Satans lies and getting people set free from them towards the saving Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is what this is about.",1407283200,10,17370,4.645350734094617

It is the Aliens from outer space and they are the devil"" just like Governments and Religions say about Recreational Cannabis, and that the people should allow their Government and their Religion to have full control of the People's freedom; then the Governments and Religions will move into a higher phase as slave-masters in which the slaves will not revolt from their slavery, and then the end result is a New World Order with a New Slave-Master, and it worked successfully by using the strategy known as fear mongering, and it deceived The World unlike any other!  Imagine Adam and Eve as innocent Aliens placed on Earth in which Human Beings were already here, and Human Beings were corrupt with Religions and Governments, and Adam and Eve were converted by Religions which would be The Talking Serpent because it talks to you in conversion, and Adam and Eve were now Religious to the Human Beings' Governments which would be The Tree Of Knowledge Of Good and Evil, and now Adam and Eve are slaves; then look at what happened to Jesus Christ for he was an Alien as well, and the hated him because he would not act Religious and they verbally attacked him calling him a alcoholic winebibber, and a glutton always celebrating with the sinners, and Jesus Christ then fought back, and the Religions and Governments then murdered Jesus Christ.  Now ask yourself, ""Who truly is the 'Real Devil and Real Satan' on this Planet Earth?""
