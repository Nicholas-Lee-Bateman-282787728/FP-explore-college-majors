8277726,4,B001AIUFII,"I don't really know who the writer of this film is, but I really enjoyed the structured story line of this film. The cast seemed to balance each other out, not to mention that the receptionist is a freaking knockout...... I have one word for her ROARRRRRRRRRRRR",1214524800,2,261,4.574468085106383

8277728,4,B001AIUFII,"This movie has a little something for everything, to entertain and offend! Reminiscent of the great 80s trash camp flicks. Grab a case of beer and a bucket of chicken and you have a fun night in with your movie watching buddies.

And very quotable too! ""Are you on...THE POT?!?"" Stoner buddies will think this is a hoot.",1213228800,,320,4.517241379310345
8277729,4,B001AIUFII,"Writer Barry Ratcliffe's  imaginative, campy script mixes horror with humor.  Low budget but high talent version of the sotry of Pocahauntus' revenge.  A showcase for up and coming stars!",1212883200,4,187,5.379310344827586
