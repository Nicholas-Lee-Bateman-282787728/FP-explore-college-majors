7932634,5,B000056PJM,"I felt that this film was several things....SCARY, yet FUNNY, HIP, SERIOUS, yet FUN and well done.  I particularly found the dialogue witty and realistic.  I thought it was a good idea handled very, very well....Totally different than any other film of this type....It sets its own genre.  Loved the 'making of' short as well.............A lot of fun.",1043280000,,351,5.017241379310345

7932636,5,B000056PJM,This movie has one of the most frightening situations ever thought up(since Bruce Willis & Ving Rhames were trapped in that room with the torture freaks in Pulp Fiction). I couldn't help imagining myself being one of the 4 unfortunate cops. The movie also contains one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a film(the pulled over driver onside of the road). The film also manages to seamlessly mix intense dialogue with witty dialogue. All around great acting by all...Well written...Killer music...And a very unconventional ending that took guts by the producers. Very entertaining film that actually has a message at the end.,999993600,,625,5.077669902912621
