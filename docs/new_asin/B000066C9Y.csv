1712496,3,B000066C9Y,"I liked this documentary. But on the other hand as with any other UFO coverage it does not have any proof of any validity of UFOs. None of the less, the folks in this are labeled as ""credible witnesses"". Whatever for that, the label is usually used in any UFO documentary.
This does not mean that this DVD is not worth a watch, I would buy this and if you read the other reviews; it is quite interesting to see the viewpoints in this film.
By the way my step dads brother is on the front cover of an old Readers Digest from around 1997 or so. I have not found it yet. He lives in Kingman Arizona and he has seen an interesting sighting.
Other than that, I have yet to be convinced that any documentary that I have seen can prove the existence of UFOs visiting our troubled planet.

1712508,5,B000066C9Y,"I was a little nervous when this dvd started out. They played a preview of another show and it looked really cheesey and poorly shot.

Luckily, this was not the case in this video, as it was done quite well and had allot of nice shots of the lights and interviews from the people who saw it.
I am already a beleiver of UFO's from other places, as I know I witnessed one. No one could make me think otherwise and this video made me feel like I am not alone. I trty to let everyone I know watch it too, I love to hear the reviews!

Although what I saw was not close-up, I saw something that did not move like anything we as humans (at least of this dimension) have at this time.
I don't know if it would be good for Aliens to make contact or not. Maybe they are playing cat and mouse with us and feel we are not ready for such a major event. I could hardly agree more. Hillbilies would be shooting at them, the military would be ready to shoot at them and there would be mass panic.

oh yea, this is a review. OK, this is an exellent documentary, worth every penny. Buy it, you will not be dissapointed!",1353628800,2,1101,4.041284403669724

1712510,4,B000066C9Y,"I enjoyed this documentary. But let me respond to some of the other viewers. This film is definitely not objective. The filmmakers are convinced that the only explanation for this event is extra-terrestrial. Maybe that is true but actually a bit more balanced view would be good. Pursue all possible explanations. I think one of the interviewees reminds us of Ocham's razor, where the simplest explanation is usually correct, which the interviewee concludes, therefore, it must be aliens. I'm not sure this is the simplest explanation, given what you have to suppose to come to that result.

However, I am not sure what the simplest explanation would be but aren't there others? Okay, the official explanation of flares sounds implausible but couldn't you find one person who could at least explain it fairly? Wikipedia says that there is some evidence for the flares explanation. How about some sort of holographic light effect like an advanced laser light show? What is the case for the mass hysteria/hypnosis? I am not saying I believe these, not knowing the full story and not having been there, but these are elements that might have been added or pursued to create a more balanced view and a more thorough investigation. The film mentions the boy who told authorities he saw planes. What it doesn't tell you is that the boy was using a telescope and may have had the best view of anyone. Why not at least investigate and interview the boy?

It seems to me that the people of Phoenix were only asking the government to talk plainly about the lights and to investigate then. But it was the government that made fun of the people's honest questions as if the whole thing were merely some loony UFO hallucinations. Give the alien views their due and maybe that is the best way that witnesses themselves have to explain it. But let a little air into this with other views.

Has anyone asked why Phoenix (even though I understand lesser but similar events have occurred elsewhere)? If these lights are a warning, isn't Phoenix one of the more unsustainable cities in the world?

If you are really interested in what it will take to make the vague kinds of changes the folks in this film advocate at the end, and if you want to know more about what we need to be warned about, see the documentaries on the coming oil crash and Collapse (such as Blindspot and Crude Awakening and anything with Michael Ruppert). If the aliens have a warning for us, that they can plainly see is in store for our species, but we cannot, it is surely the big challenge that lies ahead when oil production winds down.",1299456000,,2595,4.684210526315789
1712511,5,B000066C9Y,"Winner of numerous awards at film festivals around the country, this film manages to get Dr. Edgar Mitchell and Gov. Fife Symington on film and on the record about this amazing phenomenon witnessed by thousands. Interviews with witnesses such as military pilots who witnessed the craft itself and many highly credible professional people, this event went on for hours across the state of Arizona. This DVD may just change your mind! Excellent production values and great footage of the lights themselves. This is one to own.",1290556800,6,524,5.104651162790698

1712513,5,B000066C9Y,"Most of these documentaries on UFOs or aliens are cheesy and of extremely poor quality. The Phoenix Lights, however, is NOT one of these documentaries!
It is extremely well done, with credible eye-witnesses, first-hand accounts, and REAL LIFE actual video of the incident!
Not just one video, but multiple videos from multiple eyewitnesses.

This took place in the mid 1990's, and was witnessed by hundreds of people! Dozens of which caught it on video! You won't believe your eyes.

If you don't believe in UFOs by the end of this documentary, you MUST be blind.",1282953600,5,563,4.91578947368421
1712514,5,B000066C9Y,"Plain and simple, this was great. There are a lot of UFO documentaries out there. The nice thing about this one is that it focuses on a specific object and it's multiple occurrences. Unlike other sitings that only a few people (or one person) ever step up and talk about, there are a lot of people who saw the Phoenix Lights and gave similar descriptions. Pictures and video were taken by multiple people and some reputable ""non-wack-jobs"" who were normally skeptics even admitted that they couldn't ignore this.

Each and every one of us can believe what we want but there is a significant amount of compelling evidence that we are not only not alone in this universe, but others have visited us and there will be more visitations still. The fact is, if we ever found life on another world, we'd be fascinated by it so I'm sure that visitors are fascinated by us as well.",1276560000,6,872,4.554140127388535
1712515,4,B000066C9Y,"This is a fascinating and thoughtful documentary regarding the recurring Phoenix Lights phenomenon.  Many questions are raised.  If these are military craft, how could something so large be tucked away the rest of the time, and how could it fly with no noise or visible propulsion?  If it is from another planet, why has there been no other means of contact yet?  Why won't the military or the government pay more attention?  Can't someone fly up there and try to intercept it or get a closer look when it's coming over?",1260835200,6,520,4.670329670329671
1712516,5,B000066C9Y,This was a very honest and objective review of an well-observed UFO incident in AZ.,1259020800,9,83,4.6
1712517,5,B000066C9Y,"In 1997 a friend and I were driving down Litchfield road (near Luke AFB,Az.) towards I-10 to go to the weekly Pavillions Car Show/cruise-in, in Scottsdale Az.  I had the removable roof panel off my Vette.  Visibility was outstanding.  I'm cruisin along and suddenly noticed a very slow moving formation of somthing that upon further inspection... could not possibly have been ""aircraft"" or ""helicopters"" OR FLARES as we here on this planet know them.  And I have over 20 years experience working on many types of aircraft.  As I brought my Vette to a careful stop while exclaiming ""Woaaaaaaaaaaa"".  My friend inquired, ""What, did it break?!"" (my car)  I replied, ""No, LOOK!!!"" (pointing skyward, towards the mountains just South/South West of Pheonix.  We continued on our journey, keeping our eyes on the HUGE... formation.  It appeared we would end up VERY close to being directly underneath it, if it continued on its current direction and speed.  YES, we along with hundreds of other cars found ourselves on the shoulder of I-10 not directly under it but very close.  No further away than the buildings just off the I-10 in that area.  It was NOT hard to see them.  They were NOT obscured by anything other than the dark of night in a city area.  The lighting on each ""UFO"" was huge and quite bright.  Kinda like giant white smooth floresent light panels.  I'm guessing that had somthing to do with the energy/power source these babies use.  Maybe some kind of field generator.  You could also clearly make out the stucture itself.  It had somthing like angled I-beams like you see on a bridge for support.  At this point, My friend and I realized we were like those stupid people that must... get as close as possible. And therefore, get blasted by the UFO's weapons in the movies.  We ended up staying until the formation slowly made its way back towards the mountains and disappeared over them.  Then we continued to the car show.  And of course, there was LOTS to talk about.

Since then, I have seen a movie (NOT a documentary) I believe is no longer available.  The movie itself was a ""B"" movie.  But, not really that bad...  At the end of the movie there is a printed statement that supports the last scene in which a naked man (alive, but comatose) was found in the desert near Pheonix by a Forest ranger.  The statement says that WHAT WE SAW IN THE MOVIE was based on ""repressed memories"" extracted from people that were found comatose or ?? much like the man found in the desert.  Apparently, these abductee's...??? were messed up for about a year.",1257379200,9,2562,4.668903803131991
1712518,4,B000066C9Y,"It's Pretty Bizarre but does it prove anything? what was these lights over phoenix? can it be explained? I don't know Because I was not there. The documentary is a little boring at times, and long, but does beg the question what the .... Happen That Day??",1252627200,2,255,4.446808510638298
1712519,4,B000066C9Y,"A lighted unearthly craft flew purposely, silently and very slowly over Arizona. Its lights were seen by ten thousand people. Others claimed to see the triangle shaped outline of the craft as well. A doctor grabbed her camera and captured the event on film, while thousands of people flooded the 911 center with reports of strange lights moving through the sky.

Regardless of the vast number of witnesses, as well as the evidence caught on camera, the government first denied the event, and then later claimed the lights were caused by flares. Scientists quickly dismissed as nonsense the government's claim, and later proved it. Witnesses to the Phoenix lights were mocked at a public meeting when a government official entered the room wearing a space alien suit. One congresswoman (Barwood?) was humiliated and publicly trashed for believing the witnesses and continuing to demand answers, not laughter, from the government.

This documentary uses video of the real event, as well as an artist's simulation. As another reviewer pointed out it is difficult to tell which film is being shown at first. Several creditable witnesses give their accounts without embellishing them with fantasies and emotions. It is only during the last part of the film that imaginations take a turn off the deep end. People start speculating on why the lighted craft allowed itself to be seen by so many people. Opinions that ""space aliens"" are friendly and only want to warn us earthlings to end our dastardly, earth-killing ways, did not belong in this factual film.

I enjoyed the facts and the evidence presented. The over-the-top ""who, what, where, why and how"" speculations at the end might have been better left on the cutting room floor.",1251849600,8,1728,5.056140350877193
1712520,5,B000066C9Y,"It basically covers the famous event that occured in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997, which is the appearance of strange lights in the sky. Most people who saw it interepreted it as a huge UFO with lights coming from underneath it. Others said they were flares. The mayor of Arizona mocked and rediculed this event.

I wasn't in Pheonix to know if it was a UFO or not, but I saw this documentary and all the videos displayed in it. I am more on the UFO side of the argument because as they say, this universe is too big for us to be alone in it.

The fact that the same mayor who mocked this event later confirmed that what appeared in 1997 was a UFO and not from this earth, is quite Interesting!

Good documentary.",1248998400,5,709,4.237037037037037
1712521,3,B000066C9Y,"I agree with the first person's comment. In the beginning of the movie the events were well documented and gave compelling evidence that the objects were alien craft. I recommend the movie but the movie looses it scientific credibility during the last 20 minutes or so  because the  aliens' motivations were being interpreted by people who witnessed the spectacular light show as being loving caring creatures with concern that were environmental, religious, spiritual and anti-war and were here to warn us to clean up our act and quit destroying the planet. Mind reading has yet to be proven scientifically. For me all the years of study of the lights went down the drain. At this point I became suspicious and began doubting a rather well documented event. Another disappointing aspect of the movie was the use of re-enactment animation. This is used normally when good video coverage is not available. A viewer was not told which shots were simulated and which were not simulated giving the impression the crafts were perfect in every way and traveling at an exact velocity of 30 mph. I was reminded of the tactics used by Al Gore in ""Inconvenient Truth"" and it would also explain how they got the money to make this movie. There is a lot of profit to be made in merchandising alternate forms of energy and petroleum corporations gain a lot because of tax credits and their superior expertise in alternate energy as they find themselves unable to meet EPA standards. It was still fun to watch though and well made. By the time the movie concluded I was theorizing how they performed the special effect to make it look as if there were authentic UFOs. I concluded that some of the so called witnesses were assistants similar to the ones planted by magicians in the audience. I also theorized that the lights could have been produced by slow moving flatbed trucks on the ground using laser technology similar to that found in Disneyland. I still recommend it though as it was beautifully done and sci-fi buffs will love it.",1226448000,4,2024,4.78
1712522,4,B000066C9Y,"This is a well put together piece documenting the thousands of reports of unexplained lights over the Phoenix area in 1997. Contains many eyewitness reports, video footage and commentary from experts in the field.

However, I would have liked to have seen some analysis of the flare theory dropping behind the mountains. On another program attempting to debunk the incident, they plausibly showed how the line of disappearing lights coincide with the outline of the mountain. True, no illuminated smoke or parachute is visible, but at that distance, would it show?

What is more conclusive are the reports and video footage of the triangular series of amber lights (and in the years afterwards) in my opinion.

The DVD extras are not very interesting, wanted some follow-up investigatory work.

All in all, a very interesting documentation of the lights, albeit, not very objective, but fascinating.",1221436800,3,899,5.222222222222222
1712523,3,B000066C9Y,"There is some very important research that has been done on at least one famous video of the Phoenix Lights which I found extremely compelling. They examined a video that shows the V formation over the city in the distance, where each of the orbs flickered out one by one. They located where this video was taken, and which direction, based on the shadow of a nearby bluff in the foreground, and took a still in daylight. This photo shows the mountain range at the other side of the city. Then using a computer they overlaid the daylight photo with the Phoenix Lights video, and what you see is shocking. The Phoenix Lights, once given daylight perspective, appear to be hovering over the distant mountain range -- much further away than they originally looked... And they were not moving forward but descending upon the profile of the mountain. Each light ""flickered out"" just as it disappeared behind the mountain, one by one.

There was no question in my mind what these lights were, now that we could see it with some perspective: high altitude military flares, just as the military had tried to explain to the press after the event. These flares were deployed in the exact direction that the cameras were pointing, and were NOT over the city but much further away, at the other side of the mountain.

Light can be seen a lot further in the dark than one would expect, and can trick the eye. One evening, while in the back yard of a house in St. Petersburg, Florida, I spotted the Space Shuttle take off from Cape Canaveral at the other side of the state. I don't recall how dark it was, but I couldn't believe I could see it from so far away. The rocket flare was so bright that it looked as large as my pinky's finger nail.

I have also seen military flares before, also in Florida. They were dropped out of an aircraft that I couldn't see. But they looked very different from the flares in the Phoenix Lights video, which is why I doubted the flares explanation like everyone else. Flares do tend to illuminate the smoke trail above them, for one. The Phoenix Lights didn't. But *that's because they are a lot further away than you think.* They are much brighter and burn a different color. They are high-altitude flares used for night-time training exercises at the military base.

Does this account for all the Phoenix Lights reports? I have no idea. I heard testimony from people who said these things flew past their house, directly overhead. Whether we're dealing with two sets of phenomena that coincidentally look alike and take place at the same time, or people are making mistakes about how they remember the lights because of the way night time distorts perspective, is up to you.

Frankly I felt a little let down that at least that video of the lights were identified, because the phenomenon, the way it is presented in this video, is certainly awe inspiring. But we need to seek truth, and that means being open minded. Those who believe in extra-terrestrial visitations claim that skeptics are all close-minded, but they are being hypocritical: close-minded people will not believe anything except what they want to believe, even in the face of sound logic and contrary evidence. Both believers and skeptics can fall into this category, and I maintain that a good truth-seeker must not be close minded in either direction. There is a lot of reporting out there that simply defies logical explanation and in order to fish out the truth we can't dismiss anything out of hand, one way or the other, regardless of what we want to believe.",1213660800,15,3555,4.66347687400319
1712524,4,B000066C9Y,"Nicely done , and detailed. I especially enjoyed the eye witness accounts of what they saw. If this subject interests you , i highly recomend this Documentary.",1211328000,6,159,4.925925925925926
1712525,5,B000066C9Y,"In light of the recent spectacular sighting in Phoenix on April 21st and the bogus explanation of a layman deploying road flares attached to helium balloons one minute apart creating geometric figures in the sky (ie. an equidistant straight line of four lights changing into a perfect square and then a triangle), this excellent Documentary only strengthens the case for these anomalous events coming from out of this world.

Add the other similar 2008 sightings in Stephenville Texas, Kokomo lights in Indiana and the Oswego Lights seen in Illinois, as well as unexplained lights appearing in the skies over Granville, Massachusetts on April 18, 2008 and it is about time that we explore this fascinating and important topic in a professional and non-threatening way.

Producers Dr. Lynne Kitei and Steve Lantz have done just that.

At one point someone is listing all the things it could not be - I speak in wonderment to the tv:  'what about balloons?' - no one mentions the most obvious - balloons of some type.  Frustrating. It only arrives at night, moves steadily in a relatively straight line; I hear no one mention which direction or at what speed the wind was blowing during this event.

I think I heard that a few days ago someone in the Phoenix area put together something involving fishing-line, flares and balloons and wasn't too far off the mark as far as presentation.

And why, just because it is unidentified does it have to be extra-terrestrial in origin?  Not just extra-terrestrial, but directed by aliens that feel nothing but well-being toward us.",1209772800,7,892,4.8355263157894735

Unfortunately, it offers more questions than it answers and introduces far to much speculation than is necessary. For instance, if 10,000 people witnessed this event, why interview so few? Since Dr. Kitei is trained in the sciences, why does she spend so much time expressing her ""emotional feelings"" on the subject? And where was Arizona Governor Fife Symington? Astronaut Edgar Mitchell speaks only in broad generalities on the subject of ufos. All interviews are edited in short disconnected sound bites throughout giving the film a disjointed flow.  Also, one hour would be more than enough time to present the relevant facts. Clearly this film was extended in length by including unnecessary footage such as of children giving their opinion on ufo's and many interviews with people speculating on alien intentions. Having watched many UFO documentaries and read much on the subject very few have treated the issue with a truly scientific approach. The best of the bunch in my opinion is, ""Peter Jennings Reporting UFOs Seeing is  Believing"" first broadcast on ABC Television 2005 (DVD available on Amazon).",1458432000,,1237,5.274111675126903

It went over Phoenix Sky Harbor airport and was shimmering as it was rocking back and forth slowly. As I stated earlier I saw this from a distance of about 10 miles and it was shimmering and I remember the comment that one wing of this 'thing' could have held at least 40 of our aircraft carriers at over 1 mile long and it turned and almost hit Camelback Mountain.,1429315200,2,633,4.239669421487603
