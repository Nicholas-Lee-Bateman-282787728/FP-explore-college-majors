Just wanted to note, this is a tape from 1988, not 1995. There is a typo if anyone's noticed about the year this tape was made.",1123372800,3,294,4.157894736842105

8317290,5,6303917941,"This video is full of energy!  If you like to dance, you will love this workout video. You don't even feel as if you are working out. The music is upbeat as well as the instructor. It is wonderful for someone who is having a problem with working out every day. You can even take a few steps away with you, too!",998352000,16,310,4.0
