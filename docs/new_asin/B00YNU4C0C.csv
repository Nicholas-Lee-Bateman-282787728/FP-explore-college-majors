8718581,5,B00YNU4C0C,My mother is in the nursing home and before she had to go there she watched Country Family Reunion all the time.  The nursing home doesn't have this station so I buy her DVD's to take the place of what she is missing.  It makes her happy to enjoy watching the things she was used to watching while she was at home.,1482537600,,314,4.048387096774194

8718584,3,B00YNU4C0C,"Amazon advertisement/product description shows 5 DVD's including Backstage in both picture & product description.  Received only 4 DVD's (Main program only) without ""Backstage"" 1DVD. Main show contains 4 DVD's  & Backstage scenes contains 1 DVD. Photo/picture as advertised shows two separate boxes as described. Amazon appears to continue to leave out Backstage scenes 1 DVD to its customers. Amazon now advise ""Inventory"" problem & cannot supply ""Backstage"" 1DVD disc. Amazon have now altered product description/photo to show 4DVD's (main program only), without separate ""Backstage"" 1DVD for the same full price US$79.80.  This is occurring whenever the CFR set of 5DVD discs product including the separately boxed ""Backstage"" 1DVD is ordered. Very disappointing as to this unresolved issue. Refer attached photo.",1458000000,2,816,5.783333333333333
8718585,1,B00YNU4C0C,"I was so disappointed because the ad shows TWO DVD's and one is marked Ray Price/Backstage, which is the primary one I wanted. As the other reviewer stated, we only received ONE DVD and did not get the other one shown.  I believe that would be called ""false advertising"" by some.  I paid $89 for ONE video........NOT a happy camper. I want to know why I did not receive the other video.  Will not order anything else from Amazon until they explain this to me.",1450396800,3,459,4.376470588235295
