1713583,5,B000066IXV,"This is one to own! It's animation is higher then most series of its kind with some of the best music you will ever hear on any media! Same person who did the music from macross plus made the music for Escaflowne. The mechs in this show also stand out from gundam/macross and the many other robot animes. I'v also heard that this was aimed towards women.....well All I can say is IT'S aimed at everyone! I can't think of someone who wouldn't like this. Well worth the money I took the gamble and bought this one without much information on it but boy was it a good buy. If you like ,knights, swords, schoolgirls, magic, war and big robots this is for you.",1027900800,2,655,4.290322580645161
1713584,4,B000066IXV,"This is a great series, but its not my favorite. Id say its in my top 10 list. To tell you the truth the show gets really good starting from eps#13.
The series is about a highschool girl named Hitomi who get transported to another world called Gaea and meets up with the young king Van. Van has a large legendary espano robot called ESCAFLOWNE (hence the name of the series) While in Gaea Hitomi, Van and Merl (A cat-girl who is an old friend of Van) meet up with new firnds (like Allen and Millerna) and enemys (like Fulcen and Dornkirk).
Hitomi has the power to see and predict the future and to see the unseen.
The art work in this anime is amazing (especially one of the last battles with VAN vs ALLEN) and the dubbing is not bad at all. I do recomend this to all fantasy fans!",1027728000,2,781,4.178807947019868
1713585,5,B000066IXV,"I watched this entire series completely mystified by the creative and interesting story. It is magical to watch with the dragonhearted machines and Van the adventurous and at times obsessive hero. Hitomi is a young girl that finds herself zap into another world. She believes that she is in love with one man and finds in the end that he was never the one for her. This series is full of just about everything that a person could want out of a story. It has war scenes, fighting scenes with swords, love, evil,mystery, suspense,and fantasy. It shows the struggle to win out over evil and see the world more clearly.
Hitomi finds out that she is powerful and stonger than she could have ever imagined. This story is delivered with style and patience. The music is beautiful and uplifting. Usually I say that if the music sucks and seems out of place that 9 times out of 10 your watching a bad anime. But sometimes I'm wrong, most times I'm right on the money! Watch this series if you want to see the absolute best in anime!",1026172800,5,1023,4.475935828877005
1713586,3,B000066IXV,"B.F.D. Escaflowne! amazon.com are right when they say that Escaflowne could only be loved by an Otaku. This series plods from beginning to end, and is so fat and sprawling that by the time an episode ends it does not know where it began or where it is going. The ending itself is contrived, not to mention the fact that it's so rushed they have to end while running the credits.
  The acting is horrible. Maaya Sakamoto is about as weak and Pollyannish an actor as you could ever find. There is not one emotion that she is capable of beyond cowardice. Minami Takayami is ridiculously butch. Van, Dornkirk, and Folken all sound as if they haven't logged off in 20 years or so. No wonder they are always gutteral speakers-they need ex-lax.
  Yoko Konno's score is below her standards. Compared to what she did with ""Please Save My Planet"", ""Cowboy Bebop"", and ""Macross Plus"", this repeats itself. The score comes off as manufactured and lifeless.
  Ah yes, the animation. All I need to say about Nobuteru Yuuki is that he also did ""Chrono Cross"".

1713588,5,B000066IXV,"Do I really need to ring Escaflowne's praises for you? Most everyone who is into anime has already seen this series but for those of you who are not but may have seen and like movies like Princess Mononoke this is the series to pick up. It is by far the most accessible of any anime series I have seen and is perfect for a budding anime guru. In fact this is the very series I will show to my friends who have yet to see any anime they think is worth watching.
Visually, Escaflowne is pretty remarkable for a TV series that shows obvious signs of extremely high production values. The story may not be the most intricate in the world of anime but it more than suffices. What is most impressive about Escaflowne is the characters. Van and Hitomi are some of my favorite characters ever and are both completely believable in their respective places; Hitomi as the fish out of water teenager and Van as the young kind thirsting for revenge. I also enjoyed many of the supporting characters such as Dilandu and Folken; even the bad guys were given a proper history and motivations rather than simple blind obedience to whatever evil scheme might be in style. In fact evil itself is somewhat grayed as no character is truly evil, only misguided doing what they believe is right and just.
I would recommend Escaflowne to anyone and everyone; it is a series that can have appeal to the very young and old alike. Truly masterful work.
Note that anyone who has seen this series on Fox Kids has been watching a kiddied down version of a show that wasn't really meant for children to begin with.  Don't let that Escaflowne-lite ruin your opinion of the show.",1022457600,44,1647,4.49
1713589,4,B000066IXV,"If there's something that many people would like to do is to forecast the future, what and when something will happen and if we can change that. That's the premise on Escaflowne, Hitomi, a girl who can read the Tarot cards, is transported to Gaia, a different world from her own where she journeys along Van Fanel, heir to the Throne of Fanelia, the strange cat-girl Merle and Allen Schezar, a gallant knight.
In this world, someone is trying to create the ultimate device to change the future, the Zaibach empire, which is seeking by all costs the Escaflowne, the white dragon that can destroy their plans and is controlled by Van.
While fortune telling is nothing more than fantasy on the real world, it is interesting on how it was used on this series, as sometimes they think that it is happening as they where able to see on the cards, but it changes so what the cards told can be taken as an unknown future which may happen, but you can't say exactly when or how, because it lies on the fuzzy line that is the way someone reads and try to understand their meaning to their reality (pay special attention to what Hitomi forecasts to herself on the very first episode and what happens at the ending of the series, it says it all), which makes it useless, because you can make it up to many situations (Nostradamus someone?).
This made Escaflowne unique, because it shows that fortune telling doesn't work in the end and that people should worry on what they should do next by their own reasoning than by some magic and misterious way, even being fortune telling the basis of everything that's going on. Besides that, Escaflowne have many other merits. First, the soundtrack composed by now legendary Yoko Kanno with lots of gregorian choir and even a music that the only word said is ""Escaflowne"". Second, written and directed by Shoji Kawamori from Macross Plus and original mechanical designer for the Macross series. And last but not least, voice acting far above the average, even the comical sidekick Merle does not features a voice to annoy viewers, and Hitomi's voice is by far one of the best voices for girls on anime series, ranking hight for me as the voices for Miyung (Macross Plus) and Miyazawa Yukino (Karekano). Animation is also top-notch, with great details on the many countries they visit, complete with unique architecture and costumes to set them apart.
The sad thing is that the story was planned to develop on more than 26 episodes (something that Kawamori said himself on interviews), after episode 14 it becomes clear that they had to rush on things or they'd run out of their budget, so this makes me give this series 4 stars instead of five. And for the chance to get the whole series on a nice box and at a lower price than the original release, this box set is for sure a great deal on a great series.",1020124800,6,2835,4.582677165354331

1713591,5,B000066IXV,"SERIES REVIEW:

Escaflowne has been a favorite since its release over 10 years ago. It's one of those universal animes that appeals to almost everyone. Fantasy, action, romance, great characters, a well told, rich story and superbly constructed narrative - Escaflowne has it all. It will thrill adults and children alike, without pandering to either. It's also perhaps the single most enjoyable anime ever. Most importantly, it has heart and soul and a sense of honesty that too many animes lack. This is the type of fantasy Disney has failed to produce in a long time. It's actually more comparable to Lord of the Rings in quality.

Escaflowne is the story of a high school girl - Hitomi Kanzaki - who one day witnesses a light from which a strange boy - Van Fanel - and a dragon arrive from. After a frightening battle, Hitomi is sucked into the light with Van, ending up in an alternate world where Earth hangs in the sky. The mysterious world she enters is Gaea. A world similar to the ones of King Arthur - inhabited by kingdoms, dragons and knights. But Gaea also has technology in the form of (Guy)Melefs - huge mechs powered by Dragon Hearts known as energists. There is also organic technology that allows flight. In this frightening new world, Hitomi is swept up in war, romance, and intrigue as she desperately tries to survive and find her way back home.

Escaflowne's greatest strength might be in its characters. The cast is full of vibrant, lovable characters that's better than most any anime I've seen. Every one instantly found a place in my heart. Hitomi, with her shy demeanor, grows and finds confidence and strength throughout the series. She becomes the cornerstone of every character involved. Van is a young man at conflict with himself and his destiny. With the huge burden of being a Prince on the verge of becoming King, he is often hostile, but ultimately just juvenile and confused. Allen is the Lancelot of the story. A handsome ladies man, he is honorable to the end in serving as a knight. Merle will either charm or annoy as the cat-girl who is obsessed with Van, but I found her her likable - providing needed comic relief.

The ""villains"" of Zaibach are as intriguing as the heroes. Folken is quiet and strong. A great mystery surrounds him and his past, and his relationship with the heroes of the story. Dilandau is the one true despicable villain. Bloodthirsty and tyrannical, he has no problem killing anyone who gets in his way. Dornkirk, as the head of the villainous Zaibach empire is endlessly enigmatic. His intentions and goals remain a mystery until the end. Even the lesser characters are fascinating. Especially Princess Millerna whose 'love triangle' between herself, Hitomi, and Allen is interesting until the end. Prince Chid as the son of the Duke of Freid, Balgus as Van's mentor and Dryden as Millerna's arranged betrothed are equally essential as lesser parts to the big picture.

Escaflowne's narrative is direct and linear, but its rhythmic drive and pace is superb. The conflict between the heroes and Zaibach progresses in a logical manner. All the side stories, relationships, and multiple countries / kingdoms that become involved are superbly balanced as well. Escaflowne's focus is unusually sharp for an anime series and balanced as well as any I've ever seen. It never digresses and it doesn't feel as if any episodes are wasted, with every one enhancing the greater whole. Indeed, this superb PRAT (Pace, Rhythm, and Timing) is one of Escaflowne's biggest strengths.

The animation is a bit dated, but superb for that time. It doesn't hold up well to many of today's spectacular visual works, but it is by no means bad. Its signature style is its rendering of characters with unusually long limbs and pointy noses which lends the series a unique personality. The animation is surprisingly fluid in its motion, which makes many of the battles especially enjoyable. The details of the world it creates is outstanding and one could easily get lost in the scenery of its mythical world.

The voice acting is among the best ever captured in anime. Both the sub and dub are excellent, and for those who dislike subtitles, the dub is beyond adequate. However the sub is simply one of the best you'll ever hear. Each character is played with a sense of honesty and realism. No hokey, overdone voicework here. Each character is given a distinct personality without seeming forced. The ensamble as a whole is strong, but the one true standout is Minami Takayama as the evil Dilandau. Never in anime have I heard a character played better. A sense of melevolent evil drips from every syllable of Takayama's performance of the evil Dilandau. This makes the revelation of his past all the more disturbing.

The sweeping orchestral score by the brilliant Yoko Kanno is transcendent. Perhaps the finest ever featured in anime, and one of the finest ever in all of film. Every moment in the series that features Kanno's score is enhanced 10 fold. Beyond the orchestral score, the songs are equally as likable. The ending techno theme is the only thing that doesn't fit, but the opening theme song and almost every other featured in the series is superb. There are so many moving pieces that picking favorites would be an excercise in futility. I can only give the soundtracks (3 OSTs, Film OST, and the Theme Song and Lovers Only Compilations) my absolute highest recommendation.

If there are flaws, they're rather insignificant. Escaflowne is rather simple and linear. It avoids any kind of complexity and heavy themes and simply focuses on its fantasy narrative. I vastly prefer Escaflowne's avoidance of pretentious, trite philosophy that's too present in modern anime. However, when compared with profound works like Evangelion, Texhnolyze, or Haibane Renmei it feels a bit shallow. It's also entirely unoriginal and doesn't add anything new to the world of anime. It doesn't offer any challenge or require any need for intellectual engagement. But, faulting Escaflowne for these things would be trying to turn it into something it's isn't and didn't try to be. It simply relies on its adept execution of old ideas to present a rich and dazzling story.

Ultimately, Escaflowne gets my highest recommendation. If I refuse to compare it to more complex and profound works then I can easily justify a 5-star rating. It succeeds at being superb entertainment that isn't devoid of quality and craftsmanship, and that's something that's sorely lacking in modern anime and film alike.

DVD REVIEW:

If it can be found at a reasonable price, the Limited Edition Box Set is definitely the one to own. It has a ton of extras in a superb presentation. With it being OOP and increasingly hard to find, only the recent Anime Legends set is available. I was lucky enough to get the Limited Edition version so I can only comment on it: It comes with a Black Escaflowne action figure as well as several special features such as music videos of the songs and a ""Club Escaflowne"" (making of, kinda) featurette.",1184976000,5,7048,4.864166666666667
1713592,3,B000066IXV,"Escaflowne is a fantasy story with all the soap opera components. The characters and their relationships are very dramatic and it is nice to see the different interactions between the good, bad and in between guys. However as any good anime, death is disregarded easily and characters you learn to love like Vargas and the Raja, die quickly, full of pride, and achieving nothing. I think the back stories are stronger than the real story.",1180396800,,438,4.8533333333333335

1713602,5,B000066IXV,"Escaflowne has many strenths. The music score is one of the best I've heard and the plot is epic and has some twists. Another nice thing about Escaflowne is the show never stands still. The plot is constantly moving and there are several tragic events happening throughout the show, the first is Van's kingdom being completely destroyed. Hitomi's dark, morbid visions help increase the adrenaline rush of the show. If you're suspicious that the show will be centered around mecha finding, no need to fear. The plot and characters are given just as much time as the action in the episodes.

The only thing I don't like about Escaflowne is the character's faces are a little distracting at first. Their noses don't look quite right, but I adjusted quickly. Other than that, the animation is great. Overall, I think the show should satisfy the overwhelming majority. There is plenty of action, drama, and the characters feel very real.",1110931200,3,932,4.89873417721519

This heart stoping, dramatic series is without a doubt one of the greatest Japan Animes of all time. This has to be Kasuki Akane at his best! The first time I viewed Escaflowne was on Fox TV. However just when I was getting into it, the show was cancelled on it's 08th episode. That really sucks! Big Time! So I went out and purchased the Limited Edition TV DVD Box Set of Escaflowne for $142.32 which is not a bad price, considering that it was without a doubt well worth the money. If you are into sword fighting, dramaticy, love relationships, honor, respect, glory, and above all a great story line and a deep plot then this is definately for you!!!",1107820800,2,776,4.433566433566433
1713604,5,B000066IXV,"The first volume of Escaflowne was what introduced me to anime.  Escaflowne was what dazzled me and took my breath away.  I was stunned.  I had never seen anything like that.  I get very emotional and teary-eyed when I think of that fateful day when someone invited me to watch his video copy of it.  Many years later, after the advent of DVD's, I mustered the courage to return to the world of Escaflowne.

Escaflowne is one of the greatest series in anime, probably the greatest.  It has the epic quality, band of various fascinating characters going to defeat a great evil, strange world, chivalrous romance and battles of the Lord of the Rings.  Tolkein would have loved Escaflowne, and been proud.

Hitomi is a track star at her high school.  She is running with her girlfriend and her crush when her world changes forever.  Van Fanalia arrives on Earth to fight a dragon that has broken through the borders of time.  She is taken with Van to Escaflowne.  Hitomi meets many people.  But why is she here, in this strange world?

Known as ""the girl from the Mystic Moon,""  Hitomi manifests psychic powers of prediction and visions that take her tarot-card reading abilities to new levels.  She falls in love with the knight Allen Schezar.  He is a lot like Legolas in LOTR.  I am also in love with Allen.  He is one of the finest bishounen in anime.

The story revolves around the fall of Van's kingdom and country, Fanalia.  The powerful Zaibachs are taking over kingdoms any way they can, one by one, to get them to ally to the Emperor Dornkirk.  Van's brother Folken is Dornkirk's second in command, and is always urging his younger brother to come over to the dark side.  But Van refuses, fighting in his amazing Guymelef named Escaflowne.  Every kingdom has an army of Guymelefs, but Escaflowne is special.  It can transform into a dragon, and has more secrets that will be revealed as the series progresses.

Allen has a secret, too.  Hitomi has competition from the beautiful princess Millerna, who is in love with Allen too.  Van also has a secret.  He is the descendant of an ancient, almost mythical race of beings, whose lost civilization lies at the heart of the mystery of why Dornkirk and the Zaibachs want to take over Escaflowne.

The music in the opening is refreshing and beautiful.",1107734400,3,2303,4.640198511166253
1713605,5,B000066IXV,"I have watches a lot of anime in my time, and one of my favorites has always been Vision of Escaflowne.  I was sad when the WB took it off the air, then over joyed to find the series for sale, uncut even.

Escaflowne takes place on a planet called Gaea, where a girl named Hitomi is magically transported there with the King of Fanelia, one of the many kingdoms on Gaea.  Now on Gaea, Hitomi finds that her ESP is greatly increased in power, and intensity, and finds herself in the middle of a war between Fanalia,other smaller countries, and Zaibac.

Full of mystery and danger Hitomi and Van,whom is the king of fanalia, must over come their obsticals to stops Zaibac from fulfilling it's goal of controling destiny, who have the help of earths age old prophet, Isaac.

Escaflowne is and great story, with intriguing plots, great characters and conflicts within the story to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Color and sound are surperp, and the subtitles to the japanese lanquage track are accurate and musch preferable to watching it in english, unless of course you like to. I can find no fault to this series...there are suprises around every corner in this series...many details are left hidden and secret and are brought out to surprise you when you least expect it.

Before I begin proper, I want to criticise the editorial review of this item, mainly for giving away some plot points that occur quite late on in the story. A reviewer's job should be to give an honest opinion on the work WITHOUT giving spoilers, which Solomon fails to do. He's also unfairly critical, which any potential buyers of this series should ignore.

As it says in the synopsis, Hitomi Kanzaki is swept to the world of Gaea with swordsman Van after he slays a dragon, only to be caught up in events which may affect the fate of an entire world. The story moves at a decent pace, with a generous helping of action scenes, which thankfully, do not take precedence over the character development. The series dips its toes into many genres, including shounen and shoujo, and it benefits from it. It never seems to stall, and always maintains its direction, something which is sometimes lacking in other anime. Unexpected events do occur, but they're never completely out of sense with the story, and it certainly never ""seems to be careening out of control"" as Solomon puts it. It progresses logically and satisfactorially.

The characters, in particular the main three, Hitomi, Van and Allen, are believable and likeable, and they develop well throughout the series, being realistically affected by and realistically reacting to events around them. The supporting characters are fantastic, and undergo their own developments. They are by no means shallow characters to simply help progress the story, they are as well written and acted out as the main characters. The cast in Escaflowne is fantastic, with many memorable characters, due to both their personalities and their designs.

Which brings me on to the visuals. Despite being a series from the mid nineties, Escaflowne's animation looks almost brand new. Character designs are gorgeous and have a continuity to them. Often with fantasy genres, the desgners take this as an excuse to design characters however they want, with no regard to how they fit in to the overall world, but with Escaflowne, all costumes and characters are believable as inhabitants of Gaea. Backgrounds are wonderful, with the architecture  of the various cities and vehicles interesting and credible. Animation is fluid, and the action scenes are fast paced and interesting. While there is some stock footage, it's used minimally, and it's hardly noticeable. Think about it; while Evangelion is being re-released on Platinum Edition, with the visuals being re-mastered etc(it had to be really, the old dvds were terribly washed out), Escaflowne stands the test of time, and remains beautiful to watch.

The sound is second to none, with all the music done by the brilliant Kanno Yoko, who is one of the best anime composers around (check her out in the recent Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. To all those who thought she was a bad choice for that: HA!) The Escaflowne soundtrack is peerless, which keeps me coming back to it again and again. With music ranging from gentle melodies to roaring battle themes, it doesn't get better than this. The orchestra is superb, many can only aspire. A special mention has to be made of the opening theme ""Yakusoku wa Iranai"" (Promises Aren't Necessary). In my opinion, it is one of the most beautiful and uplifting anime theme songs ever, sung by the wonderful Sakamoto Maaya (who also provides the japanese voice for Hitomi). Which neatly brings me on to the voice acting.

To be honest, I hate dubbing. I refuse to ever watch an anime dubbed, due to poor translation, bad voice acting etc, it's a general no-no. BUT, in Escaflowne's case, the dub is simply wonderful. I know what you're thinking: ""No f*****g way"", but trust me, it is. The voice actors are great, giving emotions and believability to the characters, all of whom the voices are well-suited to (which is incredibly rare, believe me). It cannot be faulted in any way, rather it can only be commended. The japanese cast also shine of course, (Maaya-chan is infallible, she can do now wrong, whether it be with voice acting or her singing. If you have ANY interest whatsoever in J-pop, check her out, she's way better than Utada Hikaru), and if it came down to it, I'd probably only recommend the japanese cast over the english simply because they're the originals.

To summarise, I strogly recommened purchasing Escaflowne. Do not let the bad things you've heard of it on Fox Kids (they completely tore it apart, even removing the theme song) turn you off buying this fantastic series, which belongs in every anime (and even decent tv) lover's library. I can't recommend it enough.",1102464000,5,4970,4.859504132231405

1713611,5,B000066IXV,"When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's  classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne...

What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it...

If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story).

Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece ""Dance of Curse"" for instance. It reminds one a lot of ""Duel of the Fates"", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode ""mystic eyes"". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears.

Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.",1095811200,3,5989,4.7548076923076925
1713612,5,B000066IXV,"Where can I begin?  Escaflowne is one of the Holy Grails of anime, almost universally beloved and constantly appearing on anime fans' top ten lists.  Anyone who's seen the series knows why.  This show combines gorgeous animation with a genre-bending narrative and wonderful characters to produce a series that is endlessly entertaining and utterly enthralling.

The series centers around Hitomi Kanzaki, a normal high school girl who does a bit of fortune telling on the side.  One day after school, she and her friends are attacked by a dragon which appears from nowhere, and subsequently saved by a mysterious boy in armor.  Then Hitomi and the young man (who we learn is called Van) are swept back to his homeland of Gaea, where Hitomi gets caught up in an epic struggle to save the countries of Gaea from the evil Zaibach Empire.  Oh, and did I mention that there's also this mystical mech called Escaflowne that's involved in the whole thing, too?

Escaflowne is famous for its genre-bending narrative.  It is at once a fantasy adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age tale, and a mech/war series.  No one facet of the story dominates the series, meaning that there is plenty in the show that will appeal to all people of all different tastes.  Even more astounding is the show's breathtaking pacing.  Gone is the filler that pads out most anime series.  EVERY episode advances the plot and reveals new depth to the characters, and is so well written and engrossing that if you aren't careful you might just watch the entire series at once.

And given the characters that drive this tale, that wouldn't be such a bad thing.  Hitomi is the perfect heroine, running the gamut from scared high schooler to mature, empowered adult.  She balances her fears with her strength to create a wholly convincing and utterly likable character.  Van is equally well handled, who while initially appearing brazen and rude is revealed to be a troubled prince trying to do what's right.  And surrounded these two is one of the most enjoyable and well-characterized cast of characters I've ever seen in any media.  Love interest and gallant knight Allen Schezar proves a great counterpoint to Van's more aggressive personality, and I challenge anyone not to fall in love with catgirl sidekick Merle (source of most of the show's humor).  The antagonists are also extremely well done, with Folken and Dilandau being standouts.  Folken's cool confidence gives way to a fully realized man who only wants what he considers best, and madman Dilandau is so deliciously evil that he steals the majority of the scenes he's in.

And then there's the animation!  I have rarely run across a show with such high production values.  The show sports scene after scene of gorgeous animation, be it characters simply walking down the street or mechs beating the crap out of each other.  The show also sports some jaw-dropping locales and one of the most unique design styles in all of anime.  The look of Gaea is brilliant, owing in no small part to the creative mech and costume designs as well as the show's vibrant color pallet.

Another aspect that can not be underestimated is the show's score.  Musical genius Yoko Kanno has made quite the name for herself in Japan, who's name alone can generate interest in a show.  How many composers can claim that?  And with Escaflowne she delivers in spades, creating a rich orchestral score on par or above the standards for most feature films.  Her music is also expertly used to enhance the drama, with many of the series' most memorable moments being defined by her score.

A final note:  Do yourself a favor and watch the show subtitled.  Normally I don't mind dubs (in fact, I usually prefer them), but the dub for this show sucks all life and vitality out of the story and characters.  Subtitled, however, it is one of the very best anime shows money can buy.",1092009600,7,3882,4.786466165413533
1713613,5,B000066IXV,"I have seen a lot of Anime series, but only a few have come close to this fully complete story.  It has a lot of good fighting scenes including massive battles.  The only series that I have seen that comes close is Evangelion series. I give Evangelion a 3.5 becuase of the ending. It just went out the window when I saw that ending, but Escaflowne does not have that flaw.  It has a good beginning and draws you in with good character development.  3 different love triangles with a whole bunch of enemies and a whole bunch of killing. Most important it has GOOD ANIME none of those cheesy faded colors and x out eyes when someone gets knocked out.  Or sweat coming down the side of the cheek when someone messes up or gets angry. The ending was also pretty good. The only flaw I give this series is when the intensified luck soldiers come into play. That was dumb. You'll see what I'm talking about if you see it.

1713615,5,B000066IXV,"Do I really need to ring Escaflowne's praises for you? Most everyone who is into anime has already seen this series but for those of you who are not but may have seen and like movies like Princess Mononoke this is the series to pick up. It is by far the most accessible of any anime series I have seen and is perfect for a budding anime guru. In fact this is the very series I will show to my friends who have yet to see any anime they think is worth watching.
Visually, Escaflowne is pretty remarkable for a TV series that shows obvious signs of extremely high production values. The story may not be the most intricate in the world of anime but it more than suffices. What is most impressive about Escaflowne is the characters. Van and Hitomi are some of my favorite characters ever and are both completely believable in their respective places; Hitomi as the fish out of water teenager and Van as the young kind thirsting for revenge. I also enjoyed many of the supporting characters such as Dilandu and Folken; even the bad guys were given a proper history and motivations rather than simple blind obedience to whatever evil scheme might be in style. In fact evil itself is somewhat grayed as no character is truly evil, only misguided doing what they believe is right and just.
I would recommend Escaflowne to anyone and everyone; it is a series that can have appeal to the very young and old alike. Truly masterful work.
Note that anyone who has seen this series on Fox Kids has been watching a kiddied down version of a show that wasn't really meant for children to begin with. Don't let that Escaflowne-lite ruin your opinion of the show.",1081728000,4,1646,4.49
1713616,5,B000066IXV,"Many people will throw around compliments like ""The Best"" rather easily, and change their minds like the wind. I dislike using that level of description, because usually there's several things competing for that position.
Not, however, in the case of anime series. No series I've ever watched -- and I've watched a lot of them, from Mobile Suit Gundam to Harlock to Outlaw Star, Slayers, Hellsing, Metal Fighter Miku and Space Adventurer Cobra -- comes close to matching Escaflowne.
Visually, Escaflowne is stunning. Most series animation is clearly inferior to that found in anime movies, but in the case of Escaflowne it's hard to recognize that this is, in fact, a series. The backgrounds, the main characters, the action, all are done with a warm, lush attention to effect that never fails.
The music is one of the finest anime soundtracks ever made. Composed by Yoko Kanno (Macross Plus, Cowboy Bebop), it captures a spirit of mysticism and high adventure which is perfect for this series. I often leave this disc running in the background because it's so much fun to listen to. I rip TRACKS from this CD to put on my favorite collection CDs (I'm particularly fond of ""Angel"").
The story... how can I do it justice? It contains something for everyone -- love and romance, combat, magic, mecha, nods to history, duels, and all assembled in a unified whole. The best way to put it is this: for nearly seven years I ran a monthly anime night at our local Borders, and Escaflowne was the ONLY -- let me repeat that: ONLY -- anime to consistently pull in people of all walks of life. I've seen it enthrall Dragonball Z fanboys, Sailor Moon addicts, 65-year-old grandmothers, 7 year old little brothers, casual Yuppie passers-by, and cynical goth poseurs. It has magic and war, politics and romance, intrigue and action, swords and giant mecha suits, and somehow all of it works to form a dazzling coherent whole that is unmatched in all the history of animated television. When its opening theme song started, everyone would fall silent, or else sing quietly along -- even if they didn't know a word of Japanese. And for those who accuse it of unoriginality... certainly it uses tropes from other genres -- what doesn't? -- but I defy you to find any other show (anime or otherwise) which manages to combine Japanese dating customs, track and field running, mecha construction, honor duels, Sir Isaac Newton, ancient Atlantis, and parallel world cosmology with a classic romantic triangle, revenge, military strategy, and espionage.

1713617,4,B000066IXV,"The story starts out on planet Earth, where a high school girl named, Hitome is accidentally teleported to a strange world called, Gaea. Even though she wants to return to Earth, many bad circumstances prevent her from doing so. She gets involved with the young king named, Van whose kingdom was destroyed by the evil Zaibach empire. Hitomi slowly finds out that she has great telepathic powers where she is able to see into the past and future as well as read the minds of people.  The world of Gaea is like something out of fantasy novels; containing castles, kings, knights, wizards and dragons. Visions of Escaflowne contains a lot of elements from fantasy stories, but adds a unique twist by combining the world with advanced technology. For example, the military have mecha war machines, mechas with cloaking (invisability) video screens for communication, flame throwers, flying machines, floating fortresses and more strange technology. In a way their technology is more advanced than what currently exists in our own time, yet they use the mechas for sword fights (duels). I just have some minor complaints about this anime: my first complaint is the main character, Hitomi is a sissy. She was constantly fainting and getting kidnapped by the bad guys. And the good guys always came to rescue her- the damsel in distress. Secondly- almost all of the supporting characters get kidnapped and they needed rescuing as well. My last complaint was the fact that they should have killed the bad guy named Dilandua. Dilandua was always blood thirsty, killing innocent people and destroying villages just to get at the hero's. The hero's had several opportunities to kill him, but didn't. Instead they just continued running away from him. Despite these minor flaws,  the stories are interesting and have lots of surprises (I won't spoil them for you).  I also enjoyed the action sequences, watching these massive sized mechas slashing at each other in melee combat with swords and metal fists... it's a sight to see. Character development and interaction were also interesting to watch, kind of like a soap opera from the middle ages when courage, nobility and chivalry were important.  The creators of this series created a truly unique world that is rich in detail. Every sound fx, music score, animation sequence, and not to forget the storytelling is of superb quality! Even though the story panders more to a female audience, anyone can enjoy it. Even male audience will enjoy; I know I did! Minor violence- good for all ages.

1713643,3,B000066IXV,"This anime has a sort of cult following, so I decided to borrow my friend's set seen above and try it out. I got into it right away during the first couple of disks, but after that, it was abit of a disappoint for me. The reason for this is because of the writer's use of the literary mechanic of ""Deus Ex Machina,"" or ""God as a machine."" Normally this literary device is used sparingly, it is comparable to God intervening to get a character or situation to change course. I realize this anime was about fate and all that jazz, but saving the main character's lives by whisking them away on a beam of light whenever they are in trouble gets annoying after the 10th time. A prime example of this device being exploited was when the Escaflowne is damaged, so they press/pull a button/lever on the Escaflowne and low and behold(!) an interdimensional fixing service appears out of thin air to repair it! When stuff like this happens repeatedly throughout episode after episode, I tells me 1 of 2 things, either the writers didn't know how to get the characters out of the situation they got themselves into (which makes you not really care about the characters anymore) or the writers really had such low expectations from their target audience's intelligence levels!
In closing, before you flame me, remember that I am an Anime fan myself. I have seen great anime, like Grave of the Fireflies and I have seen piss poor ones which I won't mention. Escaflowne as a series is neither of those. It is a decent series, don't be a lemming and love it because it has such a hard core fan base, judge it on it's merits.",1076371200,12,1610,4.498293515358362

The animation is great, the musical score is fantastic, characters are likeable and the whole atmosphere is very well done.
The boxset is verty nicely packaged, with an actual lid (if you get the special edition verion the Escaflowne toy is in the same style box).
I've only just finished watching the series and can say that I'll definetly be watching it again.  It rates up there with my favorite Anime (Noir, Hack Sign).

The series has brilliant artwork, music, plot, politics, and for some of you, great mecha design.  The plot is a lot deeper than it seems.  The politics are extremely deep and add a sense of urgency to the series the situations inflict emotional stress on the characters.  There is a lot of ""mushy"" love stuff in the series, but it's well carried out and brings something to the series that is neccisarry.  All in all, Escaflowne is a true to itself throughout the entire series.  Three times as good the second time you watch it through (as you notice how the revelations at the end hold true in the beginning), it is a gem.

With the fully unleashed, unedited box set of the entire series, Escaflowne goes from an relatively unknown hit on early Fox Saturday mornings, to something that anime fans, serious and casual, can appreciate.
Hitomi, an ordinary girl, living an ordinary high school life, complete with stressing out over academics, athletics (she runs track) and boys (her enormous crush on the track team captain). She runs a final race for him, using the swings of a pendant she's had passed on to her since youth as a timer. Suddenly, an enormous dragon, followed immediately by a sword-wielding youth, burst out of thin air. A fight and chase ensue, before the dimension that spit the boy and dragon out reclaims them, along with Hitomi.
She learns that the young boy is Van, king of Fanelia, a distant land that's half-medieval, half-technological, with battles fought in mystical-caped giant robots called guymelefs. Van's village is decimated by invading invisible guymelefs from the evil Zaibach army of emperor Dornkirk, but not before his countrymen make a valiant sacrifice to ensure the escape of Van, his cat-girl childhood friend Merle, Hitomi, and the ultimate guymelef Escaflowne, thus setting off the rest of the story.
Sounds a bit nerdy and too ""magical."" But ""Escaflowne"" manages not to completely classify itself as magical fantasy-type anime. In fact, magic is but a small factor in the series--Hitomi's pendant carries some powers that not only allow her to see into the near future, but to spot the invisible enemy guymelefs; Van and Dornkirk's right hand man Folken both sprout wings, and are descended from a now extinct race--the main action involves swordfights, giant robot battles, and...giant robots. The love story aspect is very obvious, and muddled, with more love triangles than a high school geometry class (i.e. Hitomi and Merle love Van, or Hitomi and Marlene and Millerna fight over master swordsman Allen Schezar). It's 35 percent guymelef fights, 25 percent love story, 15 percent swordfights, 10 percent magic and 15 percent everything else (including politics, physics, legends).
There's an enormous, but not overwhelming amount of characters, weaving in and out of several plot layers. Van, Hitomi and Schezar end up as the major characters viewers will latch on to, with interesting and well-developed secondary characters in Folken, cat sisters Nariya and Eriya, and deranged Van-counterpart Dilandau. There is never a slow, dragging episode in the series, and ""Escaflowne"" never deviates from the main storyline with ""comedic"" or ""new adventure""-type episodes that other series like to throw in to prolong their shows.
Art, sound, animation and music are all top-notch for the period it was released (factoring in the new art standards in series like ""Full Metal Panic,"" ""Gasaraki,"" ""Ex-Drivers"" or ""Nightwalker""). The simple character designs are balanced out by the complex, caped, sword-bearing guymelefs. The swordfights are the extended type, not the one strike battles other series offer. The characters battle it out in one-on-one scenarios or in the army-on-army levels.
The pacing is especially rare in that it is constantly action-packed throughout the series. Many series start off slow to set up the more action packed climactic end volumes, or slow-down and deviate during explanatory flashback sessions, but ""Escaflowne"" flows as continuous roller coaster ride, with no stops for reloading. Plot points, new characters, deaths and revelations come flying at you faster than you can say ""Hitomi's haircut's too short.""
Those interested in ""Escaflowne: The Movie"" are better advised watching the entire series first, before watching the movie, which is more of a re-telling of the series, than a movie about it. For one, the movie's art and animation is far superior to the series, and the characters co-exist in completely different roles and attitudes. Watch the series first, then watch the movie.

1713649,5,B000066IXV,"Escaflowne is one of those series that leaves you hanging after every episode.  I saw the first time on Fox Kids, but when they took it off, i got the videos.  Now individually the videos are really expensive, so get the box edition, you'll probably save a lot of money... i know i wished i had.  Anyway, the anime itself is amazing.  I particularly like it because it resembles a fairy tale and i'm a big fairy tale/myth person. The characters are very well developed.  I mean i have some favorite characters, but if i told you who and why, it would give away the plot and series",1055980800,,580,4.333333333333333

A cerebral plot coupled with fascinating, highly-developed characters, mechas, action, chivalry, and romance, Escaflowne has proved to be a series from which I found I could not tear away.
  As a Christian, I found the tarot-cards highly offensive, and believe that would be a poor influence on all but the strongest of heart.

1713668,5,B000066IXV,"I have seen this entire series. Escaflowne is a wonderfully beautiful fantasy anime that will amaze. It has mecha action, love, and fantasy packed together to form one great anime. The opening theme song even sounds great. All you anime fans out there know what I mean when I say that the theme song sounds good. Most of the time the anime theme songs are horrible.
This anime is a world apart from alot of the other fantasy anime in that it has some pretty memorable characters like Hitomi and Van. Escaflowne is the mecha dragon at the heart of the story. It becomes apart of Van and I mean that literally. The symbol of the dragon heart plays a major role in driving the plot. There are alot more hearts that are healed and broken in this anime.
I advise that any anime fan interested in going on an exciting adventure filled with a power packed emotional rollercoaster ride watch Escaflowne.
By the way, Fushigi Yugi is another good one to check out.",1042243200,10,954,4.488505747126437
1713669,5,B000066IXV,"Want an anime title that's part of almost all the types anime there are? Escaflowne is for you! In Escaflowne you get your romance, sci-fi, mecha, fantasy, and probably more but I can't think of them right now. The story is gripping (I've spent hours upon hours in front of the TV watching this show; my eyes got all dried out and scratchy from staring at the TV for such an extended period of time) and the characters are pretty believable, at least the ones that could be considered ""normal."" As with most anime you also have your crazy supporting characters. I have a somewhat odd fascination with Dilandau, but that isn't why you're reading this. Get to the point, ktazle!
Hitomi is an average girl. She goes to school, is on the track team, and does fortune telling and tarot readings in her spare time. One evening, while saying a somewhat akward goodbye to a significant other, a young man magically appears right before her very eyes. Literally. Soon after the young man appears, a dragon appears, too. After the anime custom there is a fight sequence that ends with Hitomi saving the young man's life.  At first he doesn't seem all that grateful. Hitomi vents her frustration about her ingratitude and it results in her being magically transported along with the young man to another world. An epic story ensues with all the sorts of mayhem you could expect and maybe then some. Also, unlike some other anime titles, this show is somewhat intelligent.

1713691,5,B000066IXV,"...There are no clear cut bad guys or good guys anywhere in this series, and anyone who tries to claim otherwise is misunderstanding, or worse, misrepresenting things. Even Emperor Dornkirk, who very plainly engages in some serious nastiness, is doing what he does strictly out of a belief that his way of doing things is the only humane thing to do (there is one character that could be considered 'bad', but there are very definate reasons for it which will become clear as the series progresses).
As I've mentioned elsewhere, Japanese animation should not be measured against the same yardstick that American animation is routinely compared against; it would be more appropriate, not to mention fair, to compare it against the diversity of live action material.
That said, this is an absolutely stunning series, with excellent production values (for a TV series, anyway; it would probably be considered merely 'good' as a feature-film release) and a fascinating storyline. Please check it out, if you haven't already ...",1037232000,3,1023,5.131736526946108

Escaflowne is a well-thought out story with excellent animation and character development. I love the music by fabu-musician Yoko Kanno too. Her use of strings really sets the mood for the dramatic moments.
Escaflowne begins (to whet your appeitite for more) one fateful day when high school sprinter Hitomi Kanzaki experiences a disturbing vision of another world and discovers from her best friend that Amano (the track team star she has a crush on) is about to go abroad. On an impulse, she asks him the next day for her first kiss -- if, she can sprint 100 meters in thirteen seconds. But then, a young warrior prince and a dragon appears before Hitomi during the run ... that's when Hitomi's world gets turned upside down as she is transported to the warrior prince's homeworld of Gaia!

She discovers the truth about Gaea, it's connection to Earth, and her hidden powers. Hitomi will never be the same again.

This anime is a classic. It has a great story, good animation (for 1996), decent voice acting, and a great soundtrack. I totally loved this anime up until the last 5 episodes or so. Until then, the story was epic, dramatic, and engrossing. When the end was in sight, you could almost see the epic battle, heart breaking farewell, and the loss of loved ones. Nothing like that happened. The final battle just sort of stopped in the middle, the characters just kind of said see ya later, and there was no dramatic death or triumph. It burned out slowly like a cheap sparkler. I know that people aren't gonna like me saying that, but it's true. I've seen harem animes with a more touching conclusion.

Don't let that stop you from checking this series out though. Even though it ended weak, the rest of it was really good. I strongly recommend it. The prices I'm seeing for it are awful though. There is no way a series this old is worth $40. I wouldn't give any more than $25 for it. If you can find it for that, then go for it. I think that just about every anime fan can find something to like about Escaflowne. It's worthy of being called a classic. No matter how M.
