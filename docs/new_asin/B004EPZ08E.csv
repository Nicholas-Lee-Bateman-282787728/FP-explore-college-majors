4357652,4,B004EPZ08E,"I recall reading something a year or two ago about employee dissatisfaction. It commented that it tended to increase during times of economic trouble because employees who felt unhappy in the workplace didn't have the ability to escape. They were stuck with their current jobs, since leaving might mean they couldn't find another one. They also seldom got sympathy from other people who said, ""Hey, at least you have a job!"" This reached its culmination for me when the place where I worked put up a motivational poster that said, I kid you not, ""I should be grateful I have a job."" Indeed.

In this time of economic troubles, it's perhaps surprising that a movie like this, where three friends get together to kill each other's horrible bosses, hasn't come along already. Well, it sort of did in 1980 with 9 to 5, but that was a bit different. I don't think I recall Franklin Hart, Jr, shooting anyone.

The movie's title bosses are a corporate president (Kevin Spacey), a cokehead who inherited his father's chemical company (Colin Farrell), and, in one of the funnier performances, a dentist who doubles as a sexual predator (Jennifer Aniston). Their oppressed employees are, respectively, a man who is working hard for a position the corporate president takes for himself (Jason Bateman), a hard-working employee who loved the cokehead's father (Jason Sudekis), and a dental hygienist/sex offender who is recently engaged (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Charlie Day). One night while mutually commiserating with each other in a bar a plan begins to take shape. What if they killed their bosses? Soon they have a ""murder consultant"" in the form of one MF Jones (Jamie Foxx), and, with vague memories that confuse Strangers on a Train with Throw Mama from the Train, the make ready to make murder.

I had no great expectations going into this film, but I was surprised at how enjoyable it was and how much I liked it (also surprising? The ten-year-old boy sitting next me. Some parents...). The film is as raunchy as you'd expect any adult-oriented comedy to be, but it uses its raunch to great effect. There's the expected jokes centering around sex and bodily functions, but nothing too extreme.

I was also surprised at how intelligent the movie is. At the start I was coming up with objections to the notion that the characters needed to kill their bosses instead of just get new ones, only to find the screenplay explaining why they couldn't just up and quit. I was also greatly amused when the friends ran into a former pal of theirs who'd lost his last job with Lehman Brothers and since had been forced to resort to offering a ""hearty handshake"", as it were, to men in bars.

The performances were excellent all around. Spacey in particular seemed to be having a great time playing a deliciously evil man, while Aniston was clearly happy to ditch her good girl image. Day, who is a relative newcomer to film, plays a character not dissimilar to that of Charlie Kelly, proves that he can certainly hold his own on the screen with the big boys (and girl).

The movie is ably directed by Seth Gordon, who keeps the action moving at a decent, but not frenetic, pace. He also knows when to throw in a good Tarantino homage. It's produced by the somewhat infamous Brett Ratner who proves that as a director, he makes for an acceptable producer.

This isn't the best comedy ever, but it was a good time at the movies, and after a summer that's included films like the rather dull Green Lantern and the aggressively boring Transformers: Bark at the Moon, I'll take what I can get.",1310169600,22,3587,4.7296
4357653,4,B004EPZ08E,"There have been quite a few R-rated comedies this year, but they've all left something to be desired. Your Highness collapsed under being nothing but improvised toilet humor, The Hangover Part II was a complete rehash of the original, Hall Pass was just a disappointing attempt by the Farrelly brothers, and Bad Teacher was too tame to really be called ""bad"" at all. Paul and Bridesmaids were both pretty decent, but Paul wasn't nearly as good as the movies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost collaborated with Edgar Wright on and Bridesmaids pretty much played out like every other Judd Apatow movie out there. It was beginning to feel like every R-rated comedy from here on out would be so similar to everything before it that the laughs it tried to provide wouldn't be very funny at all. Thankfully, Horrible Bosses came along to prove that theory wrong.

What's interesting is that Horrible Bosses kind of follows the same formula as The Hangover; three guys getting themselves into a really terrible situation but roofies are replaced with a crazy scheme to kill their bosses. The funniest aspect of the movie lies within three guys, Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day), and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), obviously having no idea what they're getting themselves into and dealing with the situation in the worst way imaginable. Things get really crazy really fast and only get more hectic as the movie jogs along. That's essentially the movie's charm. While the formulas to the two movies are similar, Horrible Bosses does seem to offer quite a bit more than The Hangover.

The cast may be the strongest factor of the movie though as nearly everybody involved makes the most of their screen time and manages to get a laugh or two in no matter if they're a recognized name or a new face. Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston play the three bosses and they're all fantastic in their roles. Spacey just goes out of his way to be the most despicable person anyone could really come across while Farrell, despite being selfish and greedy, still manages to toss in a few pretty hysterical one-liners. Aniston will probably be the one that sticks out the most since she makes the biggest impact by being rather forward with her sexual desires for Dale. It's just such a different role from what Aniston has played in the past. The chemistry between Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis is really spot-on, as well. Their conversations, fighting amongst each other and interactions just make you really believe that these three have known each other for years. Even though his role is a little small, Jamie Foxx deserves a mention as well. Dean Jones turns out to just be a really entertaining character overall.

It's difficult to point out any sort of problems this comedy really has, if there are any at all. The film is extremely vulgar, but doesn't really feel entirely too crude or include any gross out gags like many R-rated comedies seem to fall victim to. None of the cast drags the movie down as they all do their part to drive the movie forward. I feel like it won't be as successful as some would think though and will be overshadowed by other comedies that aren't nearly as solid or as funny as Horrible Bosses is. That's really the only complaint anyone could possibly have.

Horrible Bosses is easily the most hilarious R-rated comedy of the summer. The strong cast, amusing dialogue, and entertaining banter between Nick, Dale, and Kurt is more than enough to sky rocket Horrible Bosses to the top of the list of comedies released this year. Charlie Day will have you laughing right from the start. Luckily, Horrible Bosses came along to inject some much needed hilarity into mainstream comedy this season.",1310169600,79,3710,4.801251956181534
4357654,5,B004EPZ08E,"Perhaps this is partly due to the very vocal and very packed theater I saw Horrible Bosses in, but I have to say that it was one of the best experiences I've had watching a comedy in a long time. This movie is funny, really funny. The writing is vulgar and clever, often at the same time. There is not one weak link in the cast. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis play the three main guys getting pushed around by their evil bosses. They then hatch a plan to kill each others bosses. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell play those three evil bosses. You also get other big names like Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland and an unexpected cameo from Bob Newhart. Everyone is great, but I have to give a special props to Jennifer Aniston. We finally get to see her in a role that showcases more of her talent than everything else she has done combined. She's funny, sexy and pulls of some nasty lines with ease.

I didn't plan on seeing this today, but I got bored, read some really positive reviews, felt spontaneous and headed to my theater. Best decision I've made in...well today. Forget the latest Hangover and check out one of the best comedies for grown ups in a long time.",1310083200,112,1196,4.4363636363636365

It's unclear if Aniston just decided that she'll never win an Oscar and perhaps just gave in the towel and meant this as an I-don't-give-a-care to the Academy; otherwise, sadly, with this film, her chances are now nil to ever even get nominated (she certainly didn't need to prove to anyone that she could do comedy, by way of a raunchy comedy, at that).

4358415,3,B004EPZ08E,"Review of Horrible Bosses
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Either Jennifer Aniston was still tied to the Faustian contract that forced her to work with Adam Sandler, or she was ridiculously determined to shed her FRIENDS image. Sure, that makes sense. Take the role that made you a millionaire and one of the most popular actresses in America, a household name, a hair and fashion icon, and gave you a decades-long career, and do everything you can to tear that image to shreds.

Anyway, Jennifer Anistons filthy sex-crazed character in Horrible Bosses aside, its not the worst movie in the world. Parts of it are pretty funny, if you like raunchy comedies. I look at it as the male, much filthier version of 9 to 5. Three unhappy friends plot to get rid of their horrible bosses. However, those who saw the original in the theater probably won't like this version; it has the distinct air of being aimed at the under-50 crowd.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sexual jokes and adult situations, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1497225600,,1076,4.682539682539683

But its still so darn funny! I literally choked on my coffee watching this via Amazon video even though I saw it in the theater when it was out. It's still that funny even though I know what's coming! FUNNY, people - this is just FUNNY. It's also sexy - Jennifer Anniston carries her part like she never knew any of her Friends at all - she's a Goddess possessed with getting laid and it WORKS. Anything Jason Bateman touches is gold (I know this has nothing to do with the current movie as it isn't raunchy at all, but please watch Extract {2015} with Bateman, Mila Kunis [from that 70's show], Ben Affleck, Kristen Wiig, and J. K. Simmons. YOU'LL LOVE Jason Bateman's performance in it!!!). Jason Sudeikis (hey, he and bateman both have the same first name!) is so hilarious and watching Charlie Day's performance in this movie MADE me watch and become a fanatical fan of It's Always Funny in Philadelphia. Love this movie!!! Watch it way more often than I should. You will too!!!",1482278400,,1137,4.497584541062802

A very talented movie.
The ability of the main characters is undeniable.  Charlie Day is SO flexible and so 'on point' in his scenes.  He is a quick study as an actor.  Jason Bateman delivers a very intimately emotional performance in his character.  [ I won't continue with the other excellent actors.]

This movie is simply FUNNY.  The acting is so well placed, so accurate.  Jennifer Aniston is VERY funny....  They are ALL very funny..  Kevin Spacey is very, VERY believable, as a psychopathic boss.  ALL the actors are totally believable, and their timing is impeccable  (due to editing, or NOT).
A VERY funny movie.

4359087,5,B004EPZ08E,"Im so glad that I took a chance on this Horrible Bosses movie rental. The movie is extremely funny and unpredictable. Yes, the three characters (Nick Hendricks, Charlie Day, and Kurt Buckman)who join together to hatch a dangerous and crazy plan involving their bosses are created in a way to elicit both sympathy and laughter while shaking your head and wondering why they don't just come up with alternate harm-free to others type of plans. Then there is the boss Julia Harris who shamelessly likes to cross the line with her male subordinates and the character of Bobby Pellitt who is a completely different boss from his father. The boss David Harken is in a league of his own with the a character that is almost as dangerous as Kevins Spaceys Politician persona in the House of Cards. The one thing that I enjoyed about the Horrible Bosses movie is how the plot elements keep you guessing as to how it is going to unfold next. The Jones character that Hendricks, Day, and Buckman choose to hire to do their dirty work adds a comedic element as well. The way that they find Jones and decide to hire him to do their job is even crazier.",1478044800,2,1138,4.529126213592233

I thought it was going to be more cleaver.  I just love Amazon.  Before Amazon, everything I needed would have generated a trip to a different store.  Now, if I need something  just about anything, I go and look at Amazon first. Its amazing that I can buy everything from cereal, dog food, nail products, clothing, household items and electronics.  For instance, buying this movie is just another example of the wonder that is Amazon.  I have been very impressed with the huuuge selection on Amazon.  I don't think there is anything that you cant buy on Amazon, short of perishable foods.  Most of the time you can the items cheaper than you can in the local store, but not always. Then we have the additional spectacular invention that is Amazon prime.  This praise and rant doesnt mean that I think Amazon is perfect, and I have had a few problems here and there, but over all  Amazon is my go to place for everything I need to buy, except groceries.

Jason Sudekis is better in bit parts not carrying a movie, Jason Bateman is entertaining  except he consistently plays the same character over and over again, same goes for Kevin Spacey; there were no surprises except for Colin Farrell.

Kevin Spacey's performance was absolutely fabulous, as always, and all three employee (protagonists) fit very well together as a group.

I was impressed by a lot of the writing because it really had me laughing out loud. It's also nice to see that Charlie Day, even in a comedy role, can play a role that isn't just Charlie Kelly from Always Sunny.",1446422400,,567,4.451923076923077

I watched Horrible 2 and laughed out loud enough for the flight attendant to ask what I was watching...  Yep.. it was funny enough to laugh out loud.  And so is this one.  It's the typical ""male misadventure"" type movie.. similar to The Hangover series.. If you like that type of movie, I'm pretty sure you'll find this one amusing too.

4361909,4,B004EPZ08E,"Between the end of February 2015 and May 2015 I watched seven (7) movies, in addition to the 10 I previously contributed reviews for, where Colin Farrell played a key role.  In alphabetical order, the 7 movies are: Ask the Dust, Cassandras Dream, Horrible Bosses, Minority Report, The Recruit, Seven Psychopaths and Winters Tale.

I only now became aware that the actor was being honored for his overall achievements in film.  Around mid- May this year, the movie The Lobster was awarded third place (Prix du Jury) in the Cannas Film Festival, which an international award.  But, its the Maui Film Festival Navigator Award that sums up my sentiments of Colin Farrells performances in every movie I have watched so far. Theres nothing I could write that could be more persuasive to get people to watch his movies than recent recognition of the actor and his abilities.  It seems appropriate to  support the actor and the movies Ive watched by posting this in lieu of fleshing out individual reviews.

The following is from MauiNow.com (Posted 06:23 PM HST, June 5, 2015):
Colin Farrell was the recipient of the esteemed Navigator Award, during the Celestial Cinema on Friday night (06/05/2015) at the 16th annual Maui Film Festival.

The Maui Film Festival Navigator Award honors a film artist for carving a path of distinction through the turbulent waters of the entertainment industry without sacrificing their fundamental commitment to excellence.

Colin Farrell is a chameleon who constantly creates one-of-a-kind characters that send pitch perfect pebble-to-boulder-sized ripples through whatever story his performance is helping to tell, said festival founder and director Barry Rivers. In short, Colin is a cinematic force of nature and, for that reason, the Maui Film Festival takes great pride in honoring him with its 2015 Navigator Award.",1433808000,,1848,5.1952861952861955

I love Stephen King movies and thrillers like Basic Instinct so honestly if something is supposed to be humorous for me it better be beyond belief like the satire of Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble (John Waters)..vulgarity in and of itself is not a precursor to a bad movie; bad taste can be beautiful if created right.  With that bad send off I will say this: I saw Jennifer A. and think that if for no other reason I want to see how that part develops because I have never seen her in this crazy bitch (can I use that word?) mode before and she does it quite well.  If the whole movie were this segment alone with a great script and proper development maybe it could have gone somewhere but as it stands with all these various situations one stupider than the next it's tough to even want to follow the story line.  For example; some mean boss wants to fire fat people and have an underdog do the dirty work; problem being he points out a pregnant woman and apologizes.  Where do you go from there?

This is a juvenile film chock full of the type of low gutter humour/aka ""the easy laugh"", that Hollywood churns out these days. It's an inspired cast in a film that goes no where.
The story is simple. On the one hand we have the ""good guys"": Bateman,Day and Sudeikas VS ""the bad guys"",the titled Horrible Bosses: Aniston,Farrell and Spacey. Bateman's nightmare is Spacey who makes him work long hours for nothing,denying him a promotion that he deserves. Day is up against Aniston who wants to bed Day at every turn and is sexually harassing him constantly. Finally we have Sudeikas whose late bosse's son Farrell has unfortunately taken over a company that he has no business running. Over a nightcap at a local bar the trio's discussion turns to getting rid of their bosses. It eventually pans into an actual plan,of sorts. Day first arranges a meeting with a ""wet professional"",which he believes is just a code name for hitman. No. As it turns out, the guy that arrives at a hotel room the three rent out, pees on his clients for a living. Ooops. Next they secure the services of Foxx who plays one Dean ""MF""Jones(I am not allowed to tell you what MF stands for,you'll have to guess...and it won't be that hard!).He takes $5,000 of their hard earned dollars for simple advice on how to carry out their plan. Out of all the suggestions Jones comes up with,the one that has each guy knocking off their friends bosses,appeals to them the most.
They start reconnoitering their respective bosses homes,getting clues and ideas as to their vulnerabilities. While checking out Spacey's home one of them drops a cell phone belonging to Farrell that they took earlier. Spacey later finds it and storms to Farrell's home and shoots him dead. Bateman, who just happens to have been there anyways, witnesses it and the three later confront Spacey at his home during a surprise birthday party. Spacey is not the least  bit intimidated and in fact threatens their lives. Sudeikis who had a recorder on him and was supposed to be present when Spacey actually confessed, is no where around(he is busy making out with Spacey's wife).They all leave and Spacey pursues them. He finally corners them and just before the cops arrive he shoots himself to make it look like it was they who shot him and confessed to the murder of Farrell. The cops arrive and it looks like Spacey's scheme will work until an on board security program(the equivalent of On-Star) in Sudeikas's car alerts them all to the actual conversation that took place,nailing Spacey.
The film comes to an end as Bateman finally gets his promotion,Sudeikas retains his job but with a newer and nicer boss and Day finally gets Aniston. He has a friend come in as a patient and gets Foxx to record the whole thing on film from outside.
If you want to see Aniston like you have never seen her before and Farrell as a hopped up druggie,all wrapped up in a blanket of swearing and sexually explicit language which gives a bad name to the words ""humour"" and ""innuendo"",then this baby is for you. Fortunately, there are those still with some semblance of taste and to those I strongly recommend you avoid this film like the Bubonic plague.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include only deleted scenes.
All in all a BIG disappointment. With a cast like this I was expecting better,funnier and with better taste. Ahh,Hollywood,you have to love their choices. Although,as of this writing  there is a sequel to this film out there in theatres. So,hey,what do I know?",1427500800,,3734,4.83125

Where all the women in the movie are either hitting on men or loving being hit on, aren't really doing anything meaningful except being sexually objectified. Jennifer Aniston's strip down office chat was clearly for the male viewer rather than for anything having to do with plot. Much of the dialogue was completely over the top, unbelievable to the point where it missed the mark. The work space dialogue in Office Space was more carefully crafted and purposeful than anything spewed out in this movie.

All in all kind of cute..a comedic send up of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train' which even gets a mention in the movie.
I guess I didn't rate it higher simply because they all try waaaaayyy too hard to be funny, except Jason Bateman who was a bit more restrained.

I think I am one of the few people left who feels that true talent in comedy means being funny without massive amounts of foul language.  If you don't want your kids to hear all of that, avoid this one.",1426464000,,773,4.436619718309859

4363429,5,B004EPZ08E,"Horrible Bosses is  a somewhat ""heightened"" comedy/drama, which means
exaggerated, yet still credible.  Some of the  scenes are so complex that it is hard
to believe that they were written.  That is, they seem to be improvised, being more
""alive"" than the old fashioned style of acting, (say films from the thirties up to the
seventies, in which most of the films the actors were  restricted only to the written word.
 I've never seen a movie like it.  As a former actress, one example would be a
television series, the Perry Mason Show, in which I appeared in two segments. I had
to learn the part word for word.  There wasn't room for improvisation.

Horrible  Bosses is very entertaining, and the content is familiar to all who have been
subjected to just that--horrible bosses.  I recently (literally) walked out on one of those ""bosses,"" without saying a word.  I was so relieved to get out of the position I was in.
If I had stayed on the job, I would have the extra burden of needing to use therapeutic measures to change her.
I would give this film 10 stars, even though I definitely do not approve of exterminating
evil bosses who don't know that they have been demonized.  People like that are energy
thieves, so the best thing to do is to avoid being around them.
Brilliant acting, and brilliant writing.

Unfortunately, they never seem to separate while conducting this line of business and even talking on the phone is the equivalent of a 2 way radio since they never seem far apart but just down the block.
I will say for this kind of comedy it's well cast with good employees with a vengeance against the properly titled bosses.
This certainly brings to mind the movie 9 to 5 especially since one male employee is sexually harassed much like Dolly Parton was. It also brings to mind The Hangover as all 3 buddies intertwine with each other in the same fashion.
The jokes are there and the outcome is satisfying with the use of modern technology that sets it apart from the retro look.",1417564800,,841,4.576158940397351

4364990,5,B004EPZ08E,"The movie itself is hilarious. No question about it. And those adolescents who believe it's not so, they must return to their Micky mouse cartoons. This movie is too much for them to understand.

When I received the movie, immediately started watching it. At 17:23 time stamp I notices that a significant segment of the movie is missing. That's the episode when the new boss of the chemical plant (Bobby Pellit) ordered the plant manager (Ken) to trim the fat (fire Hank on the wheelchair and the healthy woman). Right after revoking the handicap privilege from Hank the scene jumps right onto the dental office, whereas the part should continue to the segments where the plant manager tells Hank on the wheelchair that he's being terminated from the employment. This part is about 15 minutes in length.

Followed by disappointment, I've processed the return for an exchange with another one thinking that it might be a sheer accidental missing part. But wouldn't you know? It turned out to be a defaulted defect in recording, because the new one I've received had exact  the same problem, missing a part from the movie.

I've retuned the second dvd as well and scheduled my DVR to record the subject movie then I'll transfer it onto a dvd. I'd prefer the good movie as such to be on an original dvd.

Horrible Bosses, This is 40, Identity Theft are similarly sharing the same best. 
And please if you haven't yet exited your adolescence, stick to game boys and cartoons such as ""Micky mouse"" and ""Nu Pogady""

4365284,3,B004EPZ08E,"I think each and every one of us, at some point in our lives, has been inflicted with a supervisor that drives us past anger and into madness.  The three protagonists in Horrible Bosses find themselves in just that situation.  Since Hollywood is what it is, the trio actually tries to carry out the ultimate solution to the bad boss scenario, murder.  What follows we consider a foul mouthed frolic into comedic movie mayhem, and a fun frolic at that.  Think of Mad Mad Mad World with a potty mouth.
 Well, with a potty mouth and fewer laughs.  Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis (of Saturday Night Live) and Charlie Day (of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia) are simple guys boxed into intolerable situations by bosses Kevin Spacey (who plays the savage-monster-villain boss with great verve), Jennifer Aniston, who romps through her role as a relentlessly horney dentist and Colin Farrell who appears as a careless coke head with no notion of anything beyond his own appetites.  The three baddies let it all out and deliver wonderful, memorable performances. These efforts by really good actors make the film.  Just to watch them rewards us the price of the ticket.
 This is also true of the lesser lights.  Donald Sutherland and Jamie Foxx also shine brightly, if more briefly.  We have no trouble thinking that Charlie Day will stumble through the murder plot, screwing up every chance he can.  Jason Sudeikis plays a man who cannot keep his pants on, even when the stakes are life and death.  Low key Jason Batemans character tries to keep his head down, avoid confrontation and hopes that virtue will be rewarded.  All bring believable efforts to the screen.  What the writers do that stretches the bounds of credulity is to write Jennifer Aniston, who has never looked better than in this film, into an unbelievable box.  She, beauty personified, is written as a woman who must pursue male attention.  Unbelievable, but it provides for some raunchy fun.
 Multitalented John Francis Daley, the extra tall Dr. Sweets of TVs Bones had a hand in the writing.  The director is Seth Gordon, who also directed the successful Four Christmases.  Even Ron White of Blue Collar Comedy Tour has a tiny straight dramatic role.  Filling the screen with familiar faces served director Gordon well in Four Christmases and he repeats himself in Horrible Bosses.  It works here too.
 This three and a half saw blade comedy is rated a strong R for language.  To be fair, the language is no worse than one might expect at three a.m. in a sailormans tavern in Singapore.  It runs for one hour and 40 minutes, which seemed short after the Transformers marathon of last week.  Horrible Bosses came in a very respectable second to Transformers for the weekend and should do well.",1414713600,,2756,4.81063829787234

Kevin Spacey is one of the ""horrible bosses"" and his performance is stellar.  He delivers dry humor and plays the part well.  I could not stop laughing throughout this one.

In its remaining 60 minutes the film amuses just often enough, though it does not regain the momentum of those opening scenes. Kevin Spacey is nonetheless great as Jason Bateman's horrible boss and I wonder if the filmmakers considered re-working the story to be all about Spacey and Bateman. With Spacey as the sole antagonist and Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day organizing to derail him, maybe HORRIBLE BOSSES (make that HORRIBLE BOSS) would have found its groove.",1409270400,,589,5.020408163265306

4365435,3,B004EPZ08E,"Horrible Bosses is a new film with Jason Bateman and a host of other stars. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer
Aniston, and Colin Farrell portray three of todays worst bosses. Bateman and his two friends, played by
Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Charlie Day and SNLs Jason Sudeikis, work for these bosses
separately and ultimately decide their lives would be better if the supervisors from hell were dead. The
cast saves this film with appearances from Donald Sutherland and Jamie Foxx as well.
But don't pick apart the premise--youll only criticize it for being recycled (regurgitated) from classics as
Strangers on a Train (1951) and its spawned Throw Momma from the Train (1987). Avoid any in-depth
study of character, storyline, plot, reason in Horrible Bosses. Okay maybe what Im saying is if you're in it
for the laughs, Horrible Bosses delivers (hint: you might want to catch this one in theaters to get that mob
mentality when it comes to getting those laughs).This film is more a reflection of todays troubled job
market rather than a commentary on it, and it works in keeping mindless adolescent humor well
employed.",1408406400,,1121,4.968085106382978

Now if you sort of pay attention to the way Hollywood, or any theater community, works, you can tell that this is a vehicle for three less bankable, less successful comedians who've shown that they're extremely talented (Charlie Day, Jason Batemen, Jason Sudeikis) to jump into the spotlight and be supported by some really bankable talent (Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland AND Bob Newhart). This is Hollywood bending backward to do the sort of thing that Hollywood is not typically known for doingtaking risks, changing things up, giving the underdogs a chance.
And it's just lovely because the three guys are just riffing together like a great jazz trio. Of the three leads, Jason Sudeikis was the one I knew nothing of, but he was really good as the man who can't keep his special operative in his pants around the ladies. And the joke about Charlie Day's character being a registered sex offender for urinating in a playground at night with no kids around was really good. Oh, there's so much quality comedy here!

Jason Bateman plays what seems like his 50th movie straight man, and Colin Farrell has an extremely unfunny turn as a balding cokehead with no redeeming value (or lines) whatsoever.  Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder he's not.  Not sure how much Kevin Spacey had to be paid to chew the scenery as horrible boss #1.

Bobcat Goldthwait-soundalike Charlie Day has some really inspired moments and a sardonically humorous extended cameo by Jamie Foxx as a fake hit man makes it bearable.  The situations are contrived and unoriginal and the plot is basically non-existent for a movie based on the premise that each of these guys is capable of imposing the death sentence on their chief exec.  The horrible bosses are painted with such a cartoonish brush that there's never enough dramatic tension necessary to elevate the comedy.  As the movie devolves into Three Stooges land it becomes far less watchable.

4365558,5,B004EPZ08E,"This is quite a fun movie to watch.  Three friends all with bosses who had made their lives miserable, and a belief they can't leave or they'll be unemployable, decide to do something about it.  Although two of them are at the top of their profession in the corporate word, in the real one all three lack street smarts, have avoided parts of their city due to fear so are culturally socially ignorant, all of which is what makes the trio work so well on the screen, as well as gives the plot a slight bit of plausibility. The movie certainly has a bit of The Hangover feel to it, although this one's plot is more predictable. The trio sort of give off a Lethal Weapon 2 comradely vibe as well when about a third of the way into the film the dental assistant character transforms from a more sensible guy (and believable for his stance on the situation with a sex addict boss) into a klutzy third wheel Leo (Joe Pesci) type character who like with the Weapon franchise also gets locked out the car at one stage by the other two as a punishment think about your actions lesson.  Not sure why the producers changed the dental assistant mid way through, his latter character fits more into the scenes for the rest of the movie but it is a noticeable change.

The bosses who have less screen time are also well played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston and Colin Farrell.  The two male actors instantly make you dislike their characters which is what is needed for the film to work.  Anniston does a great job at playing a predatory sex addict but it's more of a comical role than a believable character.  Also the situation is a bit unbelievable, the Joe Pesci version of Dale I didn't buy would have turned her down if nothing else simply as he is too wussy to stand up to her.  Other than for the fun of making him uncomfortable it would seem unlikely his character would be attractive to a confident successful woman.  They should have added something to make her unappealing even repulsive to Dale like a giant hairy mole or perhaps cast a less attractive actress all together.

But none of these minor things, although lessening the plausibility, lessen the overall entertainment factor which for me makes Horrible Bosses a very enjoyable movie to watch.",1399939200,,2255,4.532019704433497

Best movie ever, after the Hangover (1).",1399852800,,104,4.0
4365560,5,B004EPZ08E,"Good writer and good actors are a winning combination.  Jennifer Anniston is at her very best as the dentist with no inhibitions.  And so are all the others.  This movie is hilariously funny and it never stops from beginning to end.  Not sure how she gets the bad boss label, though.  More like she's a boss with benefits.  All I can say is if you're afraid to laugh, if you're a boring dullard then by all means avoid this movie.  And you have to be wired right (most of us are) because it is a guy-gal movie throughout.

This tells it all:  The film exceeded financial expectations, accruing over $28 million in the first three days to make it the number two film in the United States during its opening weekend, and going on to become the highest grossing black comedy film of all time.  AND, because of this.....a sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, will be released on Nov. 26, 2014.  I suspect the negative reviewers don't have a sense of humor or can't laugh at themselves.",1399852800,,971,4.4602272727272725

4365564,4,B004EPZ08E,"Horrible Bosses has some really funny things in it.  It wasn't as funny as ""We're The Millers"" (One of the most surprisingly funny movies I've seen in years - didn't expect much), but it certainly had a lot of funny lines and scenes.

First the Bosses: We've seen Kevin Spacey already as a horrible boss (Swimming With Sharks), so that character wasn't new, but still entertaining.  Colin Farrell was absolutely hysterical as a coked out, nasty, balding, POS with absolutely NO redeeming qualities.  Jennifer Aniston is starting to play outside her cookie cutter comedy roles (as she did in ""We're The Millers"") and becoming a bit more convincing.  She still has a ways to go before she is able to completely shed the ""girl next door"" persona that you get the moment you look at her.  In this she plays a nymphomaniac dentist.

The Employees:  Charlie Day's character (Dale Arbus) is a slightly annoying character and the most unrealistic character of them all (not like there weren't some others).  So, a red-blooded, heterosexual male is going to be ""annoyed"" and ward off the advances (with NO INDICATION of temptation mind you) of a sexed up Jennifer Aniston???  Jennifer Aniston never did it for me personally, and I'm a happily married guy who takes his vows seriously, but I would be hard pressed to resist this one.  Even if I could, it would be quite the internal moral battle!  Jason Bateman is always... well... Jason Bateman.  I never found him funny (and still don't in this movie) and that's probably because after playing the weak, emasculated, insecure, push-over again and again and again, you just want to see some, how should one say.... balls!  It seems he always plays this character.

Then there's Jason Sudeikis.  This is the second movie I have ever seen him in (The first being ""We're The Millers""), and I'm not sure if he just gets all the good lines, or he just turns all of his lines into comedy gold.  My guess would probably be a little of both.  He is the comedy gem in this movie and once again some of the lines that come out of his mouth (often quick asides) are just hysterical!

I usually don't like talking about plots in reviews because you can get a storyline on any movie in 1000 different places.  But if you like comedy, this movie will definitely get some laughs out of you and in the quantity that warrants a rental.",1399248000,,2360,4.6409638554216865

4365632,4,B004EPZ08E,"This is a film that I thought I would hate, and it took me a little bit to warm up to it, but actually it turned out to be pretty funny and better than I anticipated. It takes a while to get accustomed to the films absurdity, and the three friends situations, but it comes together nicely as a black comedy and is funny in a slapstick sort of way.

I thought the casting was all around very good. Part of the appeal of Horrible Bosses is the camaraderie (and ineptitude) between the three friends (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis) as they try to handle their bosses from hell. They come across as three clueless guys who are clearly out of their element when it comes dealing with their situations or trying to off their bosses by hiring a murder consultant. The three villains play their roles to perfection, especially Kevin Spacey, who seems to relish and enjoy this role. Jamie Foxx only makes two appearances as the murder consultant named Jones, but they are two of the highlights of the film, and his character really makes the comedy work.

Horrible Bosses is profane and vulgar and over the top in an extreme way, but it also has a good amount of slapstick humor that works well.",1394236800,,1203,4.488584474885845

Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis are like the modern-day Three Stooges and you just can't stop watching...and laughing at their antics and screw-ups.  I do wonder how many of the bosses' actions were based on true events...it's certainly been suggested that many aspects of various people were blended together here.  Now, my only hope is that this film's sequel (November 2014) doesn't take the same route as The Hangover sequel and brings our favorite idiots into a new but relatable adventure.

The other actors are a little washed up and predictable, but with the main writer of Always Sunny in the cast it pulls it together nicely.

4365722,4,B004EPZ08E,"""Horrible Bosses"" stands on it's own. Most suggestions to me compared it to ""Hangover,' which is why I put if off so long. But that's not a fair comparison at all. ""HB"" is a well made movie, Excellently directed, with great actors delivering quick, clever, witty and insightful dialogue that crackles from the start. There's nothing gratuitous about anything in this movie. The characters and scenes are all well written, and all vital to the story. There's nothing ad hoc added for gratuitous chuckles. Everything's there with a purpose, and wouldn't be the same without it. Every character is perfectly cast, with great lines across the board from each of them, often after the fact comments in a conversation, as done so excellently by Charlie Day. I couldn't name one of the lead actors including Jason Bateman and and Jason Sudeikis before this, but they were all perfectly cast, as were supporting actors Donald Sutherland, Jamie Foxx, Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston. All playing off each other well. Every scene is well set, all the situations crackling with good writing and great characters. Constantly toying with you about the possibilities, and teasing you to the very end. No gratuitous fluff or vulgarity that's not fitting in the premise, and that separates it from comparisons to movies like Hangover or Bridesmaids (I think Melissa McCarthy's character was a force fed female Chris Farley type character that does nothing for the movie aside from trying to match the Hangover in character breadth. As if that's something to shoot for.) What's there in this movie is vital, and done with brilliant comedic delivery. This movie holds up to any comedy I've seen in a dozen years. I generally loath sequels. I'd be curious to see what more they could get from this one. I put my faith in Director Seth Green's judgement whether or not that would work. I think this movie is funny to a wide base of comedy tastes.",1388016000,,1943,4.890909090909091

Everyone was perfectly suited for their role.  it's the first time I've seen Jennifer Aniston in a comedy role that has some raunch to it and she plays it well without being really dirty.  Bateman is always good in his role.  Anyone who's had a bad boss will appreciate this.,1387584000,,294,4.490566037735849

Although these three situations illustrated during the film were over the top, they made me feel better after viewing.  My boss was similar to Nick's, Mr. Harken, but I would have traded for Dale's.  This was Jennifer Aniston's best role in my view.
The hero of the story was the unsuspecting Gregory.  The movie has an excellent cast and the story moves well across the screen.  If you're down from your job and boss, this is the film to provide the pick-you-up to get through the next week.

At first you'll think you know what's going to happen -- but wait, and watch the movie to the very end, including the credits. Several in this extraordinary cast (perhaps especially Jennifer Aniston) step outside their ""comfort zone"" and display aspects of their personalities and acting skills that may surprise you. I find it difficult to impossible to say which actor is ""best"" only because so many of them are extremely good.

The ""R"" rating for this movie is for real, and is about the language in particular (when you have a character whose very name can't be mentioned in the trailers and reviews you know you're in that territory). Many qualities of this movie (including the screenplay, the directing and editing, and the superb original score) had to come together for it to be as good as it is -- and they do.

This movie is Hilarious. I don't know anything more to say than, if you have not seen this movie you really need to. Especially if you have a Boss who is a Butt.",1377734400,5,1035,4.559139784946237

If you've ever had a horrible boss and wished they'd die, you'll enjoy this. The three would-be murderers are an act in and of themselves, perfectly in sync with each other; don't cough or blink or you could miss something.

It's a comedy, and in my opinion, not to be over-analyzed. It does its job; it distracted me and made me laugh for a few hours, sometimes out loud. I'm glad I rented it.

I get a kick out of reading some of these reviews; so many peeps take themselves and their own opinions way too seriously. Either you liked the movie or you didn't. If you didn't, then don't watch it again. If you did, then recommend it.

4365959,4,B004EPZ08E,"Though all the performances in this comedy are top notch and funny, I really think Charlie Day makes the movie.  His character is simultaneously inept and brilliant and he carries it off so seemlessly.

There are many moments that are pure slapstick and others that are a bit more nuanced comedy.

Colin Farrell - an actor of amazing capabilities (see ""Triage"") does a great job of being a disgusting, unappealing pig which is somewhat unsettling as he's anything but.  However, it suits his role well.

The movie is appealling in premise alone.  How many people like their jobs and their bosses ?  Very few I think if the truth be told.  These are normal (ish) guys out to make their futures tolerable without much of a clue as to how to go about it.  Their learning curve and the pitfalls along the way are painful and humorous.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some parts were a bit on the juvenile side which probably wouldn't be enought to bother a lot of people, but to me, they detract just a bit from the parts that are not.",1375142400,,1052,4.432291666666667

As long as you don't mind graphic and profane language (al in the name of fun, of course), you can sit back and enjoy a fun ride!  Three guys have bosses that are making their lives MISERABLE.  Then the plot to the old movie ""Strangers on A Train"" dawns on them, and they decide that if they kill each other's bosses, there will be no motive and they can get away with it.

4366019,5,B004EPZ08E,"If you like the vulgar, sometimes over the top comedies, then you will likely love this movie.  The plot is pretty simple, three guys hate their bosses and go from talking about killing them, to actually planning to kill them when things go wrong.  I think all of the actors did a great job.  Bateman was very much like his character from Arrested Development with looser morals.  Aniston really stole the show in a role that was totally different than anything she had ever played before.  You can tell she was just trying to play it as over the top as possible.  The other one who just really got into the role was Spacy.  He played his character without any redeeming qualities and really did make you hate him.

Like I said if you like the brand of humor then you will like this movie.  There is a lot of sexual humor (mostly involving Aniston's character), and some bathroom humor.  It is mainly about the stupid plan put together and badly executed by the main characters.  From trying to find a hitman, to the reconnaissance gone wrong everything just sort of spirals out of control.  The special features include deleted scenes and a couple behind the scenes things.  Nothing too extensive though, so if you are only inclined to get the actual discs when there are a lot of good bonus material you may just want to rent it.  If you are one of those people who need a movie to be realistic and logical, this is not one for you.  But for everyone else it is worth checking out.",1367107200,,1483,4.440740740740741

4366053,4,B004EPZ08E,"From Arrested Development creator, Brett Ratner, and the star of Freaks & Geeks, John Francis Daly, comes Horrible Bosses. What made this film stand out from other raunchy comedies, was that there wasn't just one super funny guy that the other played off of. Every character had their moment and was funny in their own way. The story was fairly original too. Three miserable guys decide all their problems would end if they kill each other's boss and they go on a hilarious mission to get the job done. While I love the idea and thought the movie was genuinely funny, what it lacks is character development. Other than the abuses they face at work, you don't really know too much about these guys and where they are coming from. I feel like that weakened the film, but what more than makes up for it is a ton of hilarious cameos. I love cameos and there are some great ones from Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, and Collin  Farrell. Horrible Bosses while lacking substance is defiantly good for a few laughs, which is pretty much all that I expect from these types of movies.",1361577600,,1104,4.604060913705584

The even sadder part is that it COULD have been made with minimal foul language and not lost a minute fraction of the humor.

Horrible Bosses is definitely not for everyone. Fans of shows like Always Sunny & Arrested Devolpment will appreciate this movie more than people who aren't into such demented humor. The cast was great, the bosses truly were horrible (Jennifer Aniston was so evil!). It was a fun movie to watch.
Definitely not the funniest movie I've ever seen but it's easily the funniest movie I've seen that was made in the last decade. More special features would've been nice. The dvd only has deleted scenes. Didn't even mess with the Ultraviolet copy, i have nothing to use it on and it sounds like a pain in the ass anyway. I give Horrible Bosses a 9.5 out of 10.",1356480000,,926,4.722222222222222
4366123,2,B004EPZ08E,"Horrible Bosses opens with Nick, Dale, and Kurt describing their contentment with their work. Nick (Jason Bateman) works night and day at a high-powered company, Dale feels comfortable as a dental assistant and fiance, and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) enjoys working for a kindly boss (Donald Sutherland) in a family-like work environment. Unfortunately, Nick's boss Dave (Kevin Spacey) is cruel and manipulative, Dale's boss Julia (Jennifer Anniston) sexually harasses and blackmails him, and Kurt's boss dies only to be replaced by his decadent, moronic, and mean son Bobby (Colin Farrell). They decide that, due to their bosses' destructive and deceitful natures, their best option is to kill one another's employers.

The talented cast never quite gels due to thinly drawn characters. Bateman is especially good as his usual deadpan self, but Day's edgy naturalism and occasional ham only reminds one of his much funnier television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Sudeikis's Kurt is fairly likable, yet his character is just another example of how the average guy can get any model to fall in bed with him.

The idea that workers submit themselves to bad conditions in an economy is touched upon here, as is the fact that men can be sexually harassed (though the situation is played for laughs). Horrible Bosses had potential but didn't tickle my funny bone.",1356480000,2,1363,5.1909090909090905
4366124,3,B004EPZ08E,"This is a movie working people can relate to. The main characters, men with white-collar jobs, hate their bosses for good reason. Even Dale, a dental assistant whos sexually harrassed by his hot chick boss, is justified because he wants to remain monogamous to his fiance. Those constant advances are supposed to be funny, and sometimes they are, but the sexist double standard they take advantage of isn't lost on me.

As far as malice goes, the dentist is by far the least horrible of the three bosses. She is at least attracted to Dale in a positive way. His two best friends, Nick and Kurt, have to put-up with bosses who seem to hate them right back. So, sitting in a bar one day, the three goofballs come-up with the idea to kill their bosses. Once that plot point is set, you're hooked in, waiting to see how everything is going to turn-out in the end.

Too bad the story doesnt go for real suspense. Its built upon a simple yet potentially brilliant concept that couldve worked wonders in a serious movie. As a comedy, one thats consistently almost funny but never really funny, everything from how horrible the bosses are to how the workers go about planning to kill them is caricatured to unrealistic proportions. The ending you wait an hour and a half for is especially ridiculous.

4366165,3,B004EPZ08E,"There was a lot of promise and hope with a star cast but the writing never delivered among it's comedic star cast. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis could have been the three musketeers of comedy but they play three best friends from childhood who get together and talk about their horrible insufferable bosses. Kevin Spacey plays Jason Bateman's cruel boss. Julie Bowen has a small part of Spacey's unfaithful wife. Jamie Fox even has a small forgettable part as a hired killer who turns out not to be one after all.

Really, the big surprise but not really was Jennifer Aniston who played the predatory dentist on Charlie Day's character. She wants him for sexual pleasure but he's engaged. She makes his life hell in the office and goes after him but you wonder why. Jason Sudeikis's boss never really developed to be as horrible because he had the fewest scenes.

The DVD has a seven deleted scenes but not much else to watch on the side and not even the making of the film itself. While this comedy will show up on television, the DVD offered little to compensate. The film is a mediocre comedy with a dark side and not much light there too. I think the film could have been a lot better with first rate writing.",1350259200,,1230,4.536036036036036
4366166,2,B004EPZ08E,"I can't shake the feeling that this film could have been properly hilarious and am still slightly irritated that it was as mediocre as it turned out to be.

The story goes, three mates are suffering at work due to the horrendous bosses that they work under. Having had enough, they decide to take matters into their own hands and have them 'bumped off' with hilarious results...apparently.

As mentioned before, this film could have been great if only the writers had put a bit more thought into it. The story feels lazy and by the numbers. Whilst some characters are pretty entertaining (ie Spacey's psycho and Farrel's sleazebag), others felt like filler. Aniston was more cringe worthy than funny, relying on simple smut rather than actual humour. It's like the writer has spent his life fantasising about her and thought it was a great opportunity to vent his deviancy all in the name of comedy.

As for the three main characters played by Bateman, Sudeikis and Day, they have moments of brilliance but all too often lapse into the standard gross out/shock tactics that seem to be the American comedy standard at the moment. I mean as soon as one of them started wiping his a*se with his bosses toothbrush I thought the script was grasping at straws a bit.

Also, why have they cast an oscar winning actor like Foxx in a part where he not only isn't funny, but isn't even interesting?

I know the film isn't meant to be high brow or anything and I wasn't expecting it to be, but why can't comedy writers just think a bit more about what might get a belly laugh rather than a smirk? As I said, lazy and by the numbers.",1349049600,4,1621,4.537671232876712

4366171,4,B004EPZ08E,"Horrible Bosses is one of those ""It's so crude, it's pointless drivel... and I like it"" type of comedies.  The storyline is simple- 3 employees who strongly dislike their ignorant and compassionless bosses come up with a plan to eventually murder them in the middle of the night.  It turns out this is one of the craziest nights you can imagine, haha.

The film features plenty of top notch actors and actresses, the most surprising one has to be Jennifer Aniston playing the role of an exceptionally sexually active dentist who loves to say the worst things you can imagine while hitting on her assistant (a young man who refuses to go along with her obnoxious and flirtatious requests).  Now THIS is interesting- the woman is the one who's sexually harassing the man!  The tables have turned in this instance, so obviously I strongly recommend all children completely avoid this movie as a result of Jennifer Aniston's character.

Another high point is Jason Bateman who, as always, plays the role of a guy trying to do the right thing and finding himself involved in the most unusual and regrettable of circumstances.  He needs to stop hanging out with losers and misfits!  Colin Farrell is sort of hilarious as well (believe it or not).  He plays a wimp that never says the right thing, like ever.  He inadvertently starts trouble as a result.

This is a trashy comedy, plain and simple.  It does however benefit from maintaining a somewhat coherent plot, and the jokes are numerous and hardly let up. When the actual murder attempts get underway, there are a few occasions when the storytelling is sacrified for an excessive use of pointless gibberish between the main characters, which is why my rating can't possibly be a 5 out of 5.

The three main characters in the movie are honest, hard-working guys who only want what's fair and right. Unfortunately, they all have one thing in common: Horrible Bosses who make their jobs living hell!

Kevin Spacey was just so deliciously evil in his role as the company president. The scheming tactics he uses to set up Jason Bateman's character for failure are just insidiously funny! Jennifer Aniston's role in this movie is such a drastic departure from the wholesome, ""good girl"" roles I've seen her in over the years that it was almost a shock watching this character brazenly putting unwelcome moves on her male assistant in the office right under her sedated patients' noses! Colin Farrell plays a self-involved scumbag dope-head who just inherited a thriving business from his recently deceased father. He is hell-bent on using the company as his personal ATM machine until he runs it into the ground, employees not withstanding!

I enjoyed this movie because it has a good, fast pace, the characters are outrageous and we can all share in the frustration these three guys have with their bosses and how they are pushed to the breaking point. What really works in this movie is how one off-the-cuff suggestion made in a moment of frustration and despair eventually snowballs into a series of events that takes our heroes down a path of crazy mistakes, dangerous alliances and moments of sheer hilarious chaos. I feel this movie should be considered a worthy companion piece to any collection that includes the original ""Nine to Five"" movie and ""Office Space"", another funny movie that also happens to feature Jennifer Aniston.

4366231,1,B004EPZ08E,"I DVR'd this train wreck of a movie from HBO on one of their 3 day free previews and somehow felt obligated to watch it all the way through. It's like 3 alleged comedy writers watched the old Lily Tomlin/Jane Fonda/Dolly Parton 9 to 5 movie about a bad boss as played by Dabney Coleman. These 3 ""new generation"" writers stole the basic concept and then expanded it with other bad bosses and how far 3 dissatisfied employees would go to eliminate the bosses.

If this is what hollywood passes off as ""comedy"" these days, I don't see much hope for the genre. Continual profanities and sexual references show for fact that Hollywood writers of today have no idea what is funny. Only surprising thing about the movie was I don't recall even hearing anything about pot use. Most ""comedies"" today seem to have a thing about promoting the use of pot as a comedic device. I do wonder what people like Colin Farrel and Kevin Spacey thought when they read the script. Did they actually like it or was it just a nice payday for very little effort.

I couldn't tell you what those scenes were though as I am trying to block this film from memory. DO NOT believe ANYONE saying this is a five star movie. It is not. Some SPOILERS in this review. But you can't really spoil this film.

So where to begin??? OK the 'star' studded cast perhaps. I will start with this. Just because someone is a 'Star' doesn't mean they will make a movie funny. So back to the cast. The main focus is on the characters of Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. All three characters are selfish and shallow, but one is also greatly annoying. They decide because their bosses are so 'horrible' they are going to kill them. Seems logical. But of course they run into some hysterical hyjinxs. Oh wait, no they don't. They just wander around like a couple of fools, while spewing some softball, but completely unfunny racial jokes, that involve another 'star'. Yes, Jamie Foxx is in this film. Why you ask? I'm guessing they paid him well. As for his role in the film, he plays a phoney 'hitman' that the gang offers to pay to eliminate their bosses for them. He accepts. But here's the funny part, he takes the money and instead of killing them, he offers his comical advise on HOW to kill them. Now get ready to laugh. No wait, not yet. So these three scallywags, do some investigating on their bosses and get into some pretty sticky situations, such as shoving a toothbrush into ones rectum, getting high through some 2nd hand cocaine and having sex with Jennifer Aniston. I know, please refrain from laughing yet though, there are more characters to come!

Another cast member who received a lovely paycheck was Jen Aniston. And yes, after watching this movie I get to call her Jen. She plays one of the 'horrible' bosses. Her character is a sex obsessed dentist who desperately wants to bed one of the annoying gentlemen I mentioned before. How horrible huh. There is nothing more vile I can think of than a fantastic looking woman with a great job wanting to sleep with me! But that's the funny part!!! Oh wait, no it isn't. Next is another big name, Kevin Spacey. He plays Bateman's boss. A mean, spiteful, arrogant man who apparently deserves to die. Well I'll tell you what, if someone didn't give me a promotion, I'd kill them. Oh wait, no I'm wrong again, I would never in a million years do that. And the last boss is a self obsessed coke addict with a rivetingly funny performance by Colin Farrell. I mean you really do have to see it to believe it. Hmmmmm, nope, wrong again, sorry. He just bosses Jason Sudeikis around like he was his boss or something! Can you believe that!

So those three men HAVE to kill their bosses because of just how terrible they are. The thing is.... These three guys go around racially insulting people, breaking and entering, committing adultery and let's not forget murder.
How ironic.

I thought it would be like a bad Saturday Night Live parody of The Office or Dilbert, featuring a pathetic, lowbrow script and juvenile potty mouth humor. For some reason I don't like Jennifer Aniston - I've never liked any of her movies and I don't find her attractive. I never wondered why Brad left her. But wow, she is over-the-top funny and sexy in this movie. Eat your heart out, Brad.

This movie never lets up. Virtually every scene is funny and surprising. You never know what's going to happen next. It seems to me that most of the raunchy movies are about teens or college kids. This is a raunchy movie made with and for grownups, and I'm loving it! I've seen some other raunchy adult comedies, like Zack and Miri Make A Porno, and they're okay, but this one sparkles.

Considering the crude sexual jokes that seem to be prevalent in many recent comedies, I thought Horrible Bosses was very decent, except for a scene or two.

I think Jennifer Aniston was awesome, she was hot, she was funny, and her acting was great. Actually, all of the actors did a terrific job. Colin Farrell, like Jennifer Aniston, was  in a very unusual role where he showcased his comedic skills which I didn't know he had. Kevin Spacey is great as usual; his portrayal of evil boss with gigantic ego was amazing (although his character gets too crazy in the end).

Totally Inappropriate Blu-ray edition has some extra scenes that are not in the theatrical release but they are not that many. I've seen this at the theaters recently and if my memory serves me rights, the following scenes are extra:

- When MotherFxxxx talks about the incident how he acquired the name MotherFxxxx, there is a flashback depicting the story
- There is an extra scene which shows Bobby having sex with some prostitutes

I really don't care for the Ultraviolet format as I watch my movies on big screen TV. I know many reviewers rated this 1 star due to their dislike for Ultraviolet format. I don't think it's fair to rate a Blu-ray product just 1 star due to dislike for only one of the formats offered with the product (but everybody is entitled to their opinion).

If you like this movie, I recommend this version (I bought it for $15 from Amazon, which I think is a great price; Target and FYE have the same version for $20).",1335744000,5,1707,4.508090614886731

Spacey plays an immoral megalomaniac, Anniston a maneating predator, and Farrell a lowlife cokehead; all three are unabashedly over the top, and it pays comedic dividends in spades.  So when Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (Charlie Day is hysterical) are collectively overwhelmed to the point of plotting to kill their bosses, they enlist the aid of a hoodlum (Jamie Foxx, yet another grand enhancement to the cast); and of course, everything goes to Hades in a handcart, making this madcap gem one whale of a fun ride.  Sure, there is locker room humor, and it's rude and crude, but it's done so masterfully it dares you not to belly laugh.

Look for cameos by Ron White and Bob Newhart that deliver some grins, and the entire cast deserves kudos for comedic timing, pacing, chemistry, and delivery.  It's nonsensical and out of control; but because the cast obviously isn't taking the story seriously, why should the viewer?  Just roll with the punches and enjoy the nonstop ride; HORRIBLE BOSSES is a comedy that satisfies the funny bone and serves notice that R-rated comedies can be very, very good.

And Kevin Spacey, who never seems to do a bad job in anything, is the quintessential boss-from-hell.

The idea is great on paper, but not in practice, just like the movie itself, of which story starts out with an intriguing premise, but soon becomes a muddled mess with clichd set-pieces.

The three guys, flawed but likable, are played effectively by three actors. The jokes are often funny if predictable or familiar, and there is a credible sense of camaraderie between them. Unfortunately director Seth Gordon doesn't seem to know what to do with these characters in the storyline that could be darker, more absurd or ... anyway, it could have been something with originality.

The ""horrible bosses"" are played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell. (Farrell's role is comparatively small.) They are truly ""horrible"" in a totally different way, but there is one thing in common in three of them (not characters). They are all gifted actors, but none of them is known for comedic skills (by comedic here I mean ""farce"") on big screen.

Despite the film's swearing and dirty words as well as its interesting setting that remind us of Danny DeVito when he was funny, ""Horrible Bosses"" remain in the safe territory, heavily relying on the shticks of the three leads.",1330905600,4,1475,4.963562753036437

with movies that take every opportunity to hurl a disgusting p[hrase or epithet at the audience as a substitute for genuine wit.  Richard Pryor was as profane as all get-out, but he was FUNNY.  Excessive references to sex organs and sex acts bear no

4366321,1,B004EPZ08E,"I just wanted to add my comment of DISGUST at the SO called ULTRAVIOLET Digital copy that is advertised with many Blu ray Disc's now.

I have a number of Blu ray's that are advertised to come bundled with an Ultraviolet Digital copy of the movie to watch on a computer/portable device.

Well I have not be able to even get to the stage of trying to download as when I try and goto the web site shown on the download instructions, nothing comes up at all.

With iTunes digital copies it's mostly been a straight forward process, although Warner Bros iTunes Digital copies have come up with error's in the redemption code and I REALLY don't like that all the movie studios still advertise a digital copy when they have an expiry date and after that date you may not be able to download the digital copy to iTunes. The best system I feel is at Universal Studios through iTunes, they seem to have it together the best.

What amazes me is that both the majority of Movie studios and Record Companies have bitched non stop about people pirating movies/music and yet they appear to be completely unable to come up with an effective way to distribute digital content the way people want it.

Incredible that such talented people appear to do nothing other than drive customers away.

Check out Apple you guys and perhaps one day the penny will drop that you NEED TO MAKE THINGS FAIR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD for the consumer. Particularly at WB's you guys seem experts at upsetting consumers!!!

Pretty well much everyone will play ball when the rules respect the consumer!!!!

Unfortunately, their roles are all small ones. Sadly, the viewer is subjected to another modern day Hollywood comedy that isn't funny. This one with 3 male leads who spend 95% of the movie on screen together with no chemistry of any kind. Sutherland dies in the first 5 minutes which he was no doubt happy about once he realized the poor quality of the script. We are left with the 3 lead actors who try as hard as they can to pretend there is some sort of comic chemistry between them but it comes off as forced and strained, at best. Jason Bateman is a fine actor, yes, but here he is hopelessly lost in a terrible movie.  Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, however,  appear destined to spend their careers being cast in National Lampoon movies or a similar franchise where the goal is to appeal to the bodily-function-as-humor crowd with a few dick jokes thrown in. Charlie Day is especially annoying. He has the worst voice I have ever heard in the history of film.  When he goes into his cringe-inducing, high pitched whine, even my dog leaves the room with a disgusted look on his face. The producers would have been better off making another movie using the talented supporting cast instead of these 3 fools. Aniston & Foxx were good. Spacey played a jerk boss exactly how you would expect him to, but he does such roles so well it works everytime. And the best of all was Colin Farrell whose portrayal of a coked-up sex fiend boss was hilarious. The only problem being he was only on screen for 10 minutes in the movie. Otherwise, I have nothing good to say about this movie except that Jonah Hill wasn't in it, oddly enough, since he seems to be in every movie made in Hollywood the last five years.",1329091200,5,1837,4.494011976047904

Be forewarned, this isn't appropriate for kids and can be awkward if watching it with parents or people who you wouldn't normally discuss ""adult themes"" with, as the sexual references are pretty crude (but very funny)!

None of the"" bosses"" were believable, though Kevin Spacey at least gave a convincing performance; meaning he appeared to believe he was the character he was portraying.

I think Jason Bateman is seriously funny, loved him in Arrested Development; I also love Charlie Day in It's Always Sunny, so it's no surprise to me this is a good movie.
Well, let me take that back...when this first came out I thought it was going to be stupid.  Colin Farrell isn't my favorite, Kevin Spacey can go either way for me in movies, and Jennifer Aniston (I thought) has seen her better days in comedy.  WRONG!  I watched this by myself and laughed numerous times, was never bored, and want to watch it again when my husband gets home.
It had a good beginning, the plot carried itself all the way through and the end worked out reasonably.  It didn't leave me thinking, ""That's how this is going to end?  Are you kidding me?"" like so many other movies do.

This is not the case with Horrible Bosses.  The premise is that three guys have jobs where their bosses suck.  One thinks everyone should be there for 14+ hours a day, another wants to only make money off of the company his father started and another one is threatening to tell his wife he slept with her until he does.  All these guys should quit, right?  No, it's not that simple.  Without giving anything away, they are stuck in these jobs.  So what should a guy do?  Kill his boss.  That's right, eliminate the problem and the job gets better.  Imagine the three whitest guys you know walking into an all black biker bar, and this is how their hair brained idea begins.  It moves to reconnaissance and into an attempted murder.  The whole time it's funny line after funny line.  Absolutely great movie.",1324857600,2,984,4.418994413407821

Some characters were quite annoying, however Jason Bateman was his typical dry humor self which i really liked and surprisingly, Jennifer Aniston was hilarious. Although, it was quite a flip hearing her talk the way she did, it was so not the ""Rachel"" we grew to love, she was beyond dirty.

4366591,4,B004EPZ08E,"The premise of this film (based on the trailers put out by the studio) is straightforward and entertaining. Three employees tired of their employers decide to kill each others' boss. Throughout the first third of the film, I thought, ""this is as gratifying as Hangover was."" But the more of the film I watched, the more apparent it became that that (consecutive ""thats"" not a typo) was not the case. The film is not bad, in fact, like my title conveys, the movie is actually good. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis mesh well together and their friendship is believable. Also, the supporting characters, Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston, only make the picture stronger. Of all the actors in this movie, Kevin Spacey is clearly the better and more authentic artisan of them all. Everybody's seen a boss/coworker/friend/rival like this guy. Another positive is that this movie is not short on comedic material. There is a lot in every scene. This is good for people who either love to laugh or laugh easily. And a final positive of this movie is that this is a really good Friday night movie. It made me enjoy my Friday night.

Now for a few negatives. I have two major ones. The first detrimental quality of the film is that it didn't reach the potential that I felt it could've had and that was largely due to the writing. The writing for this movie is not witty or insanely funny. The film is not unfunny, it's just moderately funny. I genuinely laughed like two or three times total throughout the 106/107 minutes the film ran, three or four times total depending on whether you want to count the cut scenes that were playing during the closing credits (which is kind of strange because Colin Farrell was as funny if not funnier in the closing scenes that were edited out than he was in the actual movie). The second disagreement that I had with the film is that I had an internal feeling from start to finish as I was watching this movie that the film had been rushed so that it would be shown in theaters on short notice to capitalize on the anti-establishment/populous sentiment that was really high in this country with regards to the countless bailouts and unethical practices by Wall Street that eventually bought the entire world economy to a collapse. That feeling that I got of them of putting out an expedited product felt a little disingenuous to me. It's very apparent to me that I don't think they would've had the idea or motivation to make a film like this when the economy was better and people weren't out in the streets protesting.

If I could, I'd give this movie three and a half stars out of five, but since I can't, I decided to give it four stars instead of three partly because Aniston was crazy hot in this film. I'm not obsessed with her as I see many guys who know about her are. Personally, I'm into women who have a different body type than she does, and I don't generally find her light skin tone attractive either, but she was really hot here. The film also received four stars instead of three because as I mentioned above, it was a good way to spend a Friday night.",1324080000,,3129,4.546099290780142

Go buy Toy Story 3 and get a good laugh out of that if you are so uptight. For people who enjoy crude comedy, and have actually read WHY it is rated R, should definitely at least rent the movie and check it out. Its especially good for college aged students to go along with movies like The Hangover, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to The Greek, etc. This is NOT a clean comedy. Emphasis on the NOT.

I would not watch this again or recommend it to anyone.",1323302400,3,282,3.76271186440678
4366652,2,B004EPZ08E,"I am a huge fan of bawdy, gross-out comedies by directors such as Judd Apatow and the Farrelly Brothers. I watched the bathroom scene in Hall Pass about 10 times, laughing until I wept. In fact, I would have sworn that no amount of coarseness, vulgarity, bad taste, or political incorrectness could interfere with my enjoyment of movie.....until I watched Horrible Bosses.

What a colossal disappointment! Each of the cast members has been outstanding in at least one previous comedy; but, with the exception of old pro Kevin Spacey, each was dismally inept in this one. Most of all, I cannot imagine what motivated Jennifer Anniston to accept the utterly thankless role of a revolting, foul-mouthed nymphomaniac. Is her career in such a decline that this was the best she could do? When a beautiful woman spouts filth, it has to be convincing; but in this case it was more a source of embarrassment (for her) than titillation. It was like watching a close friend get drunk and humiliate themselves in public, while you wince at their idiotic behavior and pray that you can eventually erase it from your memory. In this case, I don't think I can.

When you get a group of proven, talented actors together and the result of their collaboration is pure trash, the responsibility must fall upon the script, the director, or both. Granted, there were a few glimmers of humor in the production, but they were smothered by long periods of boredom and slathered with gratuitous vulgarity that simply was not funny. If a character's role contains inadequate humor, like that of Jamie Foxx, then simply give him an outrageous name and repeat it over and over and over. The entire script reeked of Junior High School locker room humor and lacked any degree of finesse or underlying wit. Surely the majority of those involved in this production recognized its significant shortcomings, yet it was released, or should I say, inflicted, upon the public in its current form.

The bottom line: any amount of crassness and vulgarity can be tolerated or even enjoyed if it is genuinely funny. Without attendant humor, it quickly degenerates into boredom and disgust. Such was the case with this very disappointing production. It should be noted that over 100 reviewers hated this movie even more than I did, and gave it only one star. This many people can't all be wrong.....for your own sake, please heed our warning.",1323129600,4,2401,4.865525672371638

If you love these guys, you will like the way they play off each other and give subtle cues, looks, and gestures towards one another throughout.

This movie delivered solid enjoyment with a significant amount of replay value.

For me, these scenes include the individual workplaces, when they break in to houses, and many of the bar scenes.

In addition to the lead actors, the addition of great supporting characters from Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, and especially Colin Farrell, really add to the entertainment of this movie.

Easily the best part of the movie are the bosses themselves played by Kevin Spacey (who's great at playing severe a-holes), Jennifer Aniston (in a nice bit of stunt casting that's a refreshing difference from her usual Rachel-centric roles) and Colin Farrell (who excels at playing the King of the Douchebags). It's strange, given that their characters are so one-dimensional, but the energy and malevolence they put into their roles goes a long way towards working in the movie's favor. Unfortunately, they only have about 20 minutes of screentime total throughout the movie and then we're stuck watching the sometimes tedious shenanigans of Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as the oft put-upon underlings who have to deal with an elitist jerk, a crazy nympho and a complete tool. Bateman, Day and Sudeikis do what they can with their roles, but they're really just not as engaging a character as their horrible bosses. As a result, the movie loses steam severely in its second half when it focuses more on these guys and their dumb attempts to off their employers.

Part of the problem is that the Day/Aniston conflict just never rings true as a really horrible situation (a fact that several characters in the film even admit to not really being a problem), so the story has to go to implausible lengths to present the situation as undesirable, much to the detriment of the central plot of the film. Sure, it's easy to hate the other two bosses, but I think most people will just wonder why Aniston's oversexed antics warrant her being killed. The sad part is that the movie seems to realize this, so this particular conflict is the least addressed in the film. Instead of making Aniston's character older or more undesirable (read: less attractive), the movie might've gotten more mileage out of the situation. But then, you'd probably have people criticizing the movie because it infers that older or less gorgeous is not sexy and this movie can't afford to alienate anybody, so they play it safe instead.

Our three leads also never actually kill any of their bosses (at least, not directly), so the movie wimps out on that sticky plot point as well. Instead you have three guys presented as seemingly smart and capable in their professions act like total f'ing morons for the last hour of the movie. It's boring, it's tired and you've seen this kind of comedic flailing around several times before. There's also the weird notion where the film tries to present Sudeikis as some kind of irresistible lothario who not only hooks up with Aniston, but Julie Bowen as well. This notion, like the movie, just seems like some sort of juvenile wish-fulfillment presented as a ""hilarious"" movie.

Ultimately, if you have no awareness of comedies pre-2000, you'll love this film. If you've enjoyed the work of the Zucker brothers, Mel Brooks or even Chevy Chase, you probably won't like this. It starts off strong and sets up a great idea, but then just completely misses the mark by channeling a Hangover type of comedy that never really does the central plot any justice. This movie is the comedic equivalent to a horror film that cuts out all the gore and grue in order to get a PG rating. While this movie is rated R, it's only because of the f-bomb and some racy dialogue, which is a hallmark of lazy comedy. Think of it like Bob Saget - sure, it was funny for a moment after Full House got cancelled and he just said the foulest things he could think of because he was on a family friendly show for so long... but then the novelty wears off and you're left with a not particularly funny comedian. That's what this movie is: one big Bob Saget. It was funny for a minute, but then ultimately just became tedious.

3 stars for a promising first half and 1 star for a disappointing second half. As a whole, Horrible Bosses gets 2 stars. Worth a look if you want to see Jennifer Aniston not be Rachel for awhile and to see Kevin Spacey return to the a-hole roles he does so well, but you probably won't watch it again.",1321920000,9,4389,4.666666666666667

I really loved Jennifer Aniston in Friends and so much wanted to be a fan of her movies, but most of them just aren't any good. Few exceptions - I really liked The Breakup. Though I found The Good Girl depressing and wouldn't watch it a second time, her acting was good. But why is it that lately anything labeled as a romantic comedy is just crude and trashy? Is that really what most people want to watch? In my opinion, this sort of script is for actors who are on the way out. It requires no acting skills, and little in the way of real vocabulary. I used to be willing to rent or buy a movie just because Jen was in it, but no more. I don't trust her ability to pick good scripts. Is she really going to be proud of her work when she looks back on a carrer filled with this kind of trash script? If she's just in it for the money and doesn't care, then I guess it doesn't matter as long as the check doesn't bounce.",1321833600,5,992,4.015151515151516

I had purchased Inception from Target on June 12, 2011 for $29.99. When I attempted to redeem the digital copy, I found it had expired on May 6, 2011 -- over a month before I had purchased it. I contacted Warner Brothers about what had happened, and the representative told me there was nothing I could do because they adequately posted the expiration date on the DVD insert, the redemption Web site, and on the box. Two of those methods are moot because you have to open the box before finding out the information. The expiration date is on the back of the DVD in fine print, meanwhile the  ""+ digital copy"" is in very large print on the front of the box. How many times do you look at the back of a movie before buying it? So obviously Warner Brothers wasn't helpful, and Target wouldn't take the movie back even though some of the ""product"" had expired before purchase because I had opened it.

What a great cast and everyone can relate to having a horrible boss or two in his or her career. The reviews were not so positive and I decided to wait for the DVD release. I know some reviewers loved the movie but I thought it was exceptionally vulgar and a total disappointment. It didn't fit the recent run of similar movies where the crass humor is funny and silly in a harmless way. I thought it would be fun to see good girl Jennifer Aniston in a bad girl role, but nothing seemed to work in this film.

Three best friends set out to rid themselves of their horrible bosses. Along the way, they come in contact a ""killer"" played by Jamie Foxx. His character's name is so wildly vulgar and in bad taste that the name cannot even be mentioned in the review. The name becomes an ongoing joke. Kevin Spacey is the boss from hell..much like his character in SWIMMING WITH SHARKS. Jason Bateman, Colin Farrell and Donald Sutherland are also great actors whose talents are wasted in the film. Farrell plays completely against his sexy image and is almost unrecognizeable as another horrible boss.

Charlie Day is the dental assistant being sexually harassed by the overly sexual dentist played by Jennifer Aniston. I had never seen Charlie Day before and I enjoyed his character at first until he started sounding more and more like Bobcat Goldthwait in his mutterings. Another actor wasted in this film.

In the beginning as we are introduced to characters, there is a freeze-frame and words describing the character appear on screen. It's a silly trick that maybe have been novel in the 1970's. It only seemed to lower the seriousness of the film.

I had hoped for a silly and funny movie but it turned out to be a silly and stupid film.",1320796800,4,1829,4.584097859327217
4366872,1,B004EPZ08E,"Where to begin?  NOT funny in the slightest:  I didn't even yawn amusingly at one lame joke or gimmick.  Literally.  The script looks like it was written by some junior high boys drinking their first beers, complete with gay and straight sexual experimentation.  Kevin Spacey was the only actor worth watching, and the only boss that seemed even slightly realistic.  Until his jealousy gets the better of him and his gun, anyway, then it's as ludicrous as all the rest.  The story starts and stops with Bateman's musings on bosses, and his is the only character of the three that almost displays some common sense.  Almost, and that's only at times.

NO such bosses could get away with 1/10th of what these losers do, especially the reverse sex discrimination (how original---NOT), or rape as it really is, by the very hot Jennifer Anniston character (a dentist?  Riiight).  What would she even see in the little Jewish guy?  A babe like that would NOT be a dentist or hitting on wimpy guys like him.  No way.  Farrell's character was just hideously ugly and disgusting, and not even Martin Sheen could be as blind and stupid about his son's drug use as this characters father (Donald Sutherland) was.

Perhaps worst of all, Sudeikis is clearly gay (why anyone would think to stick someone else's toothbrush and every other lavatory item up their butt for a slow deep rub is beyond me, unless they like it, which the character clearly does, since he smiles and sighs with every exertion.  Plus, he uses every item in the bathroom this way.  Nice).  The bathroom scene is bad enough, but then he starts obsessing over getting raped in prison because he's so hot, and how much more raped he'd be than Bateman's character.  Odd that that would be his only real concern, but again, this is juvenile behavior at it's lowest.

A terrible movie, one of the worst ever.  I spent $1 to watch it, and I feel ripped off.  If you want to see juvenile frat boys that are funny, credible, and still raunchy and sex-starved, then go see Animal House again.

There were a few laughs here and there but after about an hour we were waiting for it to end as we knew it must, and it did, in most every way. The action scenes are just pointless kitchen-sink type filler, and all in all this cast deserved a much tighter and funnier script.

But Farrell really is classic in his bit part, such a nice role for him to pick; not many A-list actors would take that part, let alone knock it out of the park. And Spacey is becoming one of the best mean screen guys around.

4366934,5,B004EPZ08E,"When I saw Horrible Bosses at the movies earlier this year, I laughed so hard, my face hurt.  I am happy to say it is just as funny watching it at home.  You forget so many of the great scenes, and some of the one-liners that were missed because we were still laughing at an earlier bit.  Easily the funniest film I have seen since the 40-Year-Old Virgin.  And just as inappropriate, if not more.  Jason Sudeikis is my favorite new comedic actor (see also Hall Pass and you'll know him from Saturday Night Live).  Jason Bateman is always a riot and much funnier in this than The Change-Up (also saw that at the movies, and while it had its moments, was a big let down).  Those of you who already watch It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia will be happy to find Charlie Day at his high-pitched zaniest.  As for the Horrible Bosses themselves, anyone who has ever seen Swimming with Sharks will already know Kevin Spacey plays the perfect boss from hell.  He does the unthinkable by actually topping THAT performance here.  Colin Ferrell is great as the coked out, balding, low-life son of Jason Sudeikis' wonderful boss, Donald Sutherland.  And Jennifer Aniston, my shining little star, THIS is a game changing role for her if ever there was one.  Now here's hoping she gets meatier roles based on this turn.  Yes, this movie is rude, crude and totally inappropriate...and I LIKE it that way.  This film delivers effortlessly while many other movies these days are a let down and try way too hard...only to have the jokes fall flat (see my review of Tropic Thunder and the backlash I have gotten over that, mainly by those with only an 8-year-old's sense of humor who probably would not get most of the jokes on Family Guy).  Also on hand in this film, the always welcome Jamie Foxx, playing a character named M*****F***** Jones -- you got to love that!  And Julie Bowen from Modern Family as Kevin Spacey's hot wife.
This version (I bought new off ebay) has the theatrical version, the Blu-ray Totally Inappropriate Version (with 8 minutes of extra footage) and the Digital version, packed with extras such as My Least Favorite Career (where cast discusses their worst jobs ever), Surviving a Horrible Boss, Being Mean is So Much Fun (the horrible bosses discuss their fun playing mean), Deleted Scenes and Making of the Horrible Bosses soundtrack.",1320105600,2,2345,4.682926829268292

Jamie Foxx has a great turn as a contract killer/consultant they try to hire. With a cast like that, how bad could it be?

There are some slow moments, and some jokes that miss. It's definitely R-rated humor, and much of it is pretty low-brow, so if that is not your thing, you probably won't like it.

4366948,5,B004EPZ08E,"The most successful black comedy since 1990's ""The War of The Roses"", ""Horrible Bosses"" is simply one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The plot deals with three best friends who share one element in common: they all have the boss from hell. The trio decide they have had enough and attempt a plot to kill their nasty employers by hiring a hitman.

 What makes the movie work is the hilarious script and the wonderful acting of the leads and the excellent supporting cast. Jason Bateman is great to look at (as always), Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell (I actually didn't recognize him), and Jamie Fox give memorable performances, but for me the gem in this movie is the beautiful Jennifer Aniston. She plays a dentist who is nothing short of a sex maniac and is determined to bed her male dental assistant. Jennifer's portrayal borders on a combination of Joan Crawford/Bette Davis/Annie Wilkes/ and Alexis Carrington all rolled into one. Picture the biggest bitch you have ever seen portrayed in movies or television, multiply it by ten and you have this character. Aniston actually dyed her hair black for the role and the language that comes out of her mouth is similar to a sailor's who has been at sea for a year. Absolutely hilarious!

 ""Horrible Bosses"" was a certified hit making over $200,000,000 at the box office and there is talk there will be a sequel.",1319932800,5,1367,4.707112970711297

4366950,5,B004EPZ08E,"This review is for the rental. I cant speak to the quality of the discs.
Anyway, my girlfriend and I watched this last night and laughed throughout the movie. The interplay between the trio of Justin Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis was pretty exceptional in my opinion. They are all funny actors, and each has a different style, which played well together, blending dry humor with camp humor with neurotic humor seamlessly. Spacey was the perfect horrible boss IMO. Colin Farrell....well, i'll say they couldn't have done a better job of making a Hollywood Hunk (as my girlfriend calls him) into the most loathsome disgusting person. You can easily despise him in this movie. Aaaannnnndddd.....Jennifer Aniston....she needs to remain a brunette I'm telling you. I cant remember her being more attractive (which is saying a lot).
So, basically, each of the three friends has a horrible boss (the latter three actors mentioned) whom they hate working for. They are drinking one night and start wondering what it would be like to just do away with the bosses. How much better could their lives be if they didn't have to deal with them? Well, one thing leads to another as they decide to turn conjecture into reality.
What results is in my opinion a hilarious, mistake driven romp through their efforts to kill their bosses. I won't tell you more about the actual story, but i think everybody was cast perfectly for their roles, and this is definitely a movie i would watch again. The ending was simply awesome!
p.s. There are some funny outtakes at the end, so don't just turn the movie off when it's over if you are interested in seeing some of these bloopers.",1319760000,,1667,4.791666666666667

I didn't think the movie was predictable or boring. The situations were funny, the bosses were over-the-top in a good way. There was action and shock value. All the actors were great. The only thing I can think of that would be a legitimate reason to not like Horrible Bosses is perhaps the less-than-plausible storyline/circumstances. The three guys had so many opportunities to be caught due to their inexperience or some would say stupidity. Who owns a huge house and does not have an alarm system? The likelihood of no one being home during every ""surveillance mission"" is slim. Announcing in public that they're looking for a hitman? ""Luck"" had a lot to do with the success of these guys.

4366954,2,B004EPZ08E,"It has a few moments. As the New Yorker said (roughly), it's sounds good when described, but it does not work well, a lot of funny ideas wasted. Kevin Spacey steals every scene he is in, but he's just being the same mean guy he often is. I've now come to realize why Jason Bateman did not make it after Teen Wolf 2: he only has one character in him and he does it in every movie. Poor guy has not made a great movie yet. He works as the central character in Arrested Development because of the enormous talent surrounding him and the great writing. The guy from IASIP is just annoying. Anniston's character does not exist in real life, she is purely wish fulfillment. The three central men are portrayed as smart guys and then we are supposed to believe that all three of them will mess up their caper at every chance. They do nothing right, very predictably. Colin Farrell is fun, but only because it's him, like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. Steve Buscemi would have been better in both roles, but we would have just believed him and not thought it funny to have a Hollywood heart-throb play a douchebag. Is it funny to see a ""stud"" play a prick with a comb-over? Maybe for the first five seconds. The best moments are played by Jamie Foxx, as well as the way too short appearance by the guy from the Fantastic Four. Overall, the plot is obvious, the comedy is clunky, we don't get to know any of the characters at all (well, maybe Kevin Spacey's the most).",1319587200,5,1459,4.347985347985348

Now, imagine if you will where you have officially had enough to the point where you want to kill your boss. That is the story of `Horrible Bosses'.

`Horrible Bosses' is a simple to follow story with lots of laughs and it really isn't the most original comedy out there. However, what makes this film so great is the amazing ensemble cast that is in this film. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day & Jason Sudekas are brilliant together and give us one great laugh after another. Then you have the bosses played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston & Collin Ferral. What did it for me was Jennifer Aniston whom I am not a fan of, but to see her playing the outrageous role of the nymphomaniac dentist was some of the most impressive acting I have ever seen from her.

While this movie is very funny, it is far from perfect. The story was not as great as `Bridesmaids' and Jennifer Aniston & Collin Ferral were very underused. I would have loved to see the two of them more in the movie because I loved what I saw in the parts they were in throughout the film. Still, you will get your laughs from this one and it was one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time and believe me where comedy is heading these days it's a real challenge to find a good one.

The story is ludicrous - maybe playing out the fantasies most people control about disliking their 'bosses' is OK but actually showing it is another item altogether. Potty mouth dialogue, sociopathic behavior supposedly masked by three guys who 'really aren't all that bad', and placing the roles of Bosses who are over the top obnoxious and maladaptive in the hands of actors of the caliber of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Farrell is a gross waste of talent. Then padding the 'story' with appearances (albeit brief) by Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, Jamie Foxx and especially Ioan Gruffudd - there must be some favors owed somewhere.

It is a committee written script (Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein) and it shows: this is more a disconnected series of standup comedian jokes than a story. Seth Gordon directs with a heavy hand on exasperatingly gross language and sexual innuendoes, insulting just about everybody possible. The only saving grace about this 'film' is the comedic timing by Jason Bateman and his cohorts in crime - Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis. There are some funny lines but the sorry mess you have to wade through to get to them is hardly worth the effort.

Spacey is brilliant as the venomous, capitalistic middle manager, a role he's had decades to perfect. Anniston's sex-crazed, blackmailing dentist is equally tremendous, while Farrell is barely recognizable as the selfish, partied out, combover-laden incompetent.

4367018,1,B004EPZ08E,"Horrible Bosses represents exactly why I should watch the trailer before seeing a mainstream, Hollywood film nowadays. I haven't been paying too much attention to new releases lately, so when I saw the poster of the flick I thought it looked neat. Kevin Spacey is a great actor, and he was great as a horrible boss in ""Swimming With Sharks."" I imagined this film would be something similar to that, but crossed with something more accessible like Office Space.

What I didn't expect was the actual film. Spacey, Aniston and Farrell are good, okay and weak in their roles, respectively. They are barely in the movie compared to what I expected. They may have about 20 minutes of screen time put together. The rest of the film centered around the bumbling hijinks of Bateman, Day (in an extremely annoying performance) and Sudekis (in a suprisingly annoying performance) that just felt like The Hangover. I didn't hate The Hangover, but I hated this film. And so did my roommate and his girlfriend. We watched this film together, and I don't think I've ever hit the stop button as quickly as I did in this film when the credits began to roll. And my roommate and his girlfriend had exited the living room within the same ten seconds. The next day I apologized for renting the film, they accepted and we all had a good laugh. Laughter is the best medicine, especially after a piece of crap like this film.

One star, and that is for Spacey's first two scenes. Even Aniston was trashy in it. And Farrell looked like he was sleepwalking.

Did you know that Jamie Foxx is in this movie? Yeah, I didn't even know either.",1319241600,6,1613,4.613240418118467

First the Movie:  FUNNY !!!  This is this year's Hangover type comedy, if you haven't already seen it you are missing out.  If you have, you've got to watch it again...it's funnier every time!!

The Digital copy: The industry standard Digital Copy lets you transfer to any compatible device (smart phone, ipad, tablet, windows media, iTunes, etc. to watch ANY time you want  This Ultraviolet/Flixster copy only lets you STREAM the movie on their app or on your computer.  This means that you have to be ONLINE to watch the digital copy that you paid for!  This does you no good on a plane, train, car road trip, etc.

I emailed Ultraviolet and Flixster about this and was told that my ""Watch anytime, anywhere"" digital copy can really only be watched anytime (you are online) or anywhere (that you can get online)

I give Ultraviolet and Flixster ZERO stars and Horrible Bosses 5 stars.",1319241600,16,952,4.75

4367021,5,B004EPZ08E,"First, let me say I wasn't a fan of Bridesmaids or The Hangover.  Saw them both and wondered what all the hype was about.  Second, I had scanned the reviews for this one before renting it and decided that since there seemed to be a 'half n' half' on it - some loved it and some were disappointed - it was probably worth a look.  I'm so glad I did, as it was one of the funniest 93 minutes I've enjoyed in a long time!

The 3 main characters really aren't the bosses, but their employees.  Each with their own set of quirks, these three friends have growing up together and remaining friends, and hating their bosses in common.  What struck me about a third of the way in was how much it reminded me of the movie '9 to 5' - the theme of wanting to kill the boss and the comradery between the main characters.

All the characters were played perfectly.  All of them are really one-dimensional, but they don't need to be more.  It all works and you get some surprising big name stars you've not seen in awhile popping into the movie too.

Situational comedy is at the core of this film.  It's not slap-stick, but the dialogue between the characters is sharp and on-point.  If you are laughing too hard, the beauty of a rental is you can rewind to catch what you just missed!  I did it several times while watching this movie.

You get a happy ending with lots of laughs from start to finish. The characters are fun, you empathize with the employees, feel the 'ugh' from the bosses, and laugh at the ineptness of regular guys who could be you, or your friends.

Horrible Bosses is for anyone who enjoys comedic bi-play without a concern for the movie 'should' or 'could' be.  Just have fun with it!  You'll be glad you did.

-----------------------------

UPDATE 11/17/15:  I've probably seen this film half a dozen times more and I continue to enjoy it, finding new things to laugh about and considering this film one of my go-to, fun favorites.

It bears restating that it's not going to be for everyone, but if you're not overly sensitive to naughty, crude talk and like the actors (Bateman, Aniston, Spacey...) give it a look. For me, I find I like it more now than I did the first time I saw it, which doesn't happen all that often.

Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day made their friendship believeable and Kevin Spacey, Colin Ferrell and Jennifer Aniston pulled off their roles as the psycho, the tool & the maneater.

All that being said, I would like to seque into a couple of questions that I can't seem to answer about people that post ""reviews""

1. If you didn't see the movie on amazon VOD (or likely at all) can you spare us one word reviews like ""SUCKS!"" -- how are you helping people?

2. If you did see the movie but go on to write a four paragraph screed about how it is offensive to your 3 year-old, LEARN TO READ. There's something called
a ""RATINGS SYSTEM"" designed to help you keep from watching movies like this with your children. Look for the capital ""R"" for ""RESTRICTED""

3. In keeping with my opening line, we are entitled to our opinions, but I have grown weary of the reviewer who would like to tell us all about
how they could write, shoot, act, and direct better than the people who just got paid millions of dollars to do so. REALLY? Then WTF are you doing writing
reviews for amazon. Go make your own movie so some loser can pan it here after it hits VOD.

Please forgive the rant.

Horrible Bosses is a better-then-expected silly buddy/gross out comedy one has come to expect from Sudeikis and Bateman, mainly because of Spacey and a bawdy turn
by Aniston.

In general, this is a pretty funny movie.  It is better than ""Hangover 2"" but falls short of ""Bridesmaids"" in the scheme of ""R"" rated comedies this year.  Jason Bateman plays Nick in his usual cool, but nerdy at the same time, way.  Jason Sudeikis is Kurt and is always funny.  Finally, newcomer Charlie Day (""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") plays the sexually harassed employee of Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston).  In reality the best roles may be for the mean bosses, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell.  And Jamie Foxx steals his scenes as the hit man go between.  The set up is kind of ridiculous.

Bateman and Sudekis are great and Kevin Spacey is as awesome as you would expect playing the evil boss. Jennifer Anniston is funny, and sexy as hell. Colin Farrel seems a little out of place as the tool bag coke head boss, but does deliver some great lines and is fun to watch. Sadly to say though, what really killed this movie for me though was Charlie Days character. It seems like they cast this guy to mirror the role Zach Gilifanakis had in Hangover as the off-kilter third-wheel friend who manages to screw things up more than he helps. The difference though is that he is not funny or amusing, is in pretty much every scene, and literally talks NONSTOP the whole time, dominating scenes with his motor mouth. One bad/annoying actor is generally not enough to make me dislike a movie, but he really killed this one for me. 2.5 stars because of that, otherwise its a 4.

It is clearly a light comedy, and on that level I thought it delivered in spades. I found myself laughing out loud several times. The chemistry between the actors added to the believability of the preposterous plot, a plot that Abbott and Costello or the three stooges would have found themselves comfortable in. The writers dodged cliches and stayed on the edge and I only caught the drift of the surprise twist about three quarters of the way through. I write and I know plot devices, there are only so many and the makers of ""Horrible Bosses"" managed to find a few new twists and keep the dialog fresh. That is if the viewer can dispense with a few levels of disbelief that anyone could be so moronic or deranged. In fact there are many people who are as moronic and  deranged as the actors characters, so it wasn't that much of a stretch.
Jennifer Aniston in the sexiest role I have ever seen her in. Kevin Spacey shined as the machiavellian manipulator, as did Colin Ferrel, who takes a part way out of his usual range. the three principals were consistently funny, playing off each other like real friends would.

Yes the movie is funny -I mean these guys are idiots but believable to some degree at being ""real guys"". I mean you have a nymphomaniac Jennifer Aniston (admit it guys, we all dream it), a Kevin Spacey character that is an over the top jerk (I'm keeping this review family friendly, fyi) and a coked out freak in Colin Farrell.

If you enjoy this kind of humor, you'll enjoy Horrible Bosses. The premise that these three seemingly-ordinary guys are fed up enough with their bosses to hatch a plan to murder them is ridiculous, but if you'll suspend your disbelief for the film, you'll have a good time. Mild-mannered, straight-laced social climber Nick (Jason Bateman) works for a world-class corporate a-hole (Kevin Spacey), getting to work at 6am each morning only to be berated for being 2 minutes late. Meanwhile recently-engaged and convicted sex-offender Dale is constantly sexually harassed by his nymphomaniac dentist boss and Kurt endures the crazed ravings of a cocaine-addicted sleazebag (Colin Farrell) who inherited the company reins. Why don't they just quit? It's the terrible job market, don't-cha know? The movie uses the rationale of a bad economy, so they can't just quit. They'd have to kill their bosses.

The humor is decidedly raunchy and low-brow, so don't expect the Mrs. to join you on the couch. There's a lot of explicit sexual humor in here and references to sexual acts, though oddly, the movie is completely devoid of any nudity. We see Jennifer Aniston in lingerie under a lab coat and then later pleasuring herself in a hot tub, but that's about it. Early in the movie, she sprays Dale's crotch with water and says some funny and nasty things. It's fun to see her in such a different role, saying and doing so many dirty things. This alone might be worth the price of admission for many guys.

If it weren't for Kevin Spacey and Jason Bateman, I probably would not have enjoyed this movie as much. They really make this work. Jamie Foxx also has a smaller, but funny role. I also got a kick out of seeing cameos by Donald Sutherland and Ioan Gruffudd (in a humorous exchange as the ""wet works man"").

The hype around Ultra Violet says that it will allow you to stream your digital copy to any device and the files are store in the cloud so that once you purchase a single digital copy you won't ever need to replace it when technology changes.  The reality is that the system is being forced on consumers before it is ready as of the release of Green Lantern and Horrible bosses (first 2 movies to use the system in mid October) exactly 0 mobile devices or set top boxes support the system and few will in the near future.

The story is ludicrous - maybe playing out the fantasies most people control about disliking their 'bosses' is OK but actually showing it is another item altogether. Potty mouth dialogue, sociopathic behavior supposedly masked by three guys who 'really aren't all that bad', and placing the roles of Bosses who are over the top obnoxious and maladaptive in the hands of actors of the caliber of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Farrell is a gross waste of talent.  Then padding the 'story' with appearances (albeit brief) by Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, Jamie Foxx and especially Ioan Gruffudd - there must be some favors owed somewhere.

It is a committee written script (Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein) and it shows: this is more a disconnected series of standup comedian jokes than a story.  Seth Gordon directs with a heavy hand on exasperatingly gross language and sexual innuendoes, insulting just about everybody possible.  The only saving grace about this 'film' is the comedic timing by Jason Bateman and his cohorts in crime - Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis.  There are some funny lines but the sorry mess you have to wade through to get to them is hardly worth the effort. It is an embarrassingly poor film, but  as with the popularity of The Hangover et al it sells tickets.  Sad.  Grady Harp, October 11",1318636800,7,1474,4.911290322580645

- Colin Ferrell says to fire a guy who he calls Prof. Xavier for ""Creeps me out, rolling around all day in his special little secret chair."" (It's a wheelchair)

All the actors are perfectly cast and there are laughs, but it's not a constant laugh-out-loud movie like I expected.

It seemed to promise the same kind of that's-so-my-boss! exclamations that Office Space did, but none of the villains in Horrible Bosses seem real except maybe Farrell's greedy drug-addict character. Spacey and Aniston are basically cartoons in this movie, and although that makes for a few chuckles here and there, their characters just don't feel analogous to any horrible boss that anyone in the audience is likely to have worked for. So the movie operates in an old fashioned slap-stick manner, which feels unpleasantly dated in my opinion.

Of the three protagonists, Jason Bateman is the only I thought was really funny, but he's always good for a laugh.  I don't care for Sudeikis at all and that other fellow just seemed like he was in Jerry Lewis mode the whole movie.

But here's the brief:  This is not a classic comedy by any means, and I don't think anyone can truly relate to most of it's content, but it's worth watching for a descent amount of laughs and chuckles, especially if you're having a movie night with the gang.

Aniston and Spacey are terrific, and there are moments of high hilarity to be found. It was a fun movie, but it could've been an all-time great.",1311984000,2,638,4.747747747747748

4367154,4,B004EPZ08E,"""Horrible Bosses"" is a very funny and very raunchy film. Three downtrodden employees hate their despicable bosses and conspire--with the ""help"" of ""M.F."" Jones (amusingly played by Jamie Foxx)--to kill them. The bosses are very good at being crumby to their underlings, but their victimized workers are quite inept at murder.

The actors playing the bosses have the meaty roles, and they all handle these wonderfully. Kevin Spacey keeps Jason Bateman on a leash with promises of a promotion, getting him to do pretty much anything he wishes; Jennifer Aniston is a nymphomaniacal dentist, who sexually harasses Charlie Day, her dental assistant; and Colin Farrell is a greedy, callous, and perverted crud, who is hated by Jason Sudeikis.

There are a number of comic twists and turns, with the murder plots going right, then wrong, then right, then.....

This is a film that will make you laugh a lot, with the excessive behavior of the hateful bosses leading to most of the laughs.",1310947200,5,981,5.006134969325154
4367165,4,B004EPZ08E,"Three friends have horrible bosses. For one reason or another they are stuck at their jobs. Nick works for Kevin Spacey who is a ridiculous driver and badgers Nick when he is 2 minutes late. Kurt works a chemical company. His new boss is a coke head who sees the business as an ATM machine and wants to run it into the ground. When he says he wants to ""trim the fat"" that means he wants to fire fat people. Dale, who is engaged, is a dental assistant to Jennifer Aniston, who wants to have sex with him. Even his close friends have trouble believing that is a problem.

Kurt claims killing his boss, who wants to dump waste on the proverbial poor Bolivians would save lives and that they have a moral duty to kill their boss. Jennifer Aniston develops a comical potty mouth in this film, one that makes Madonna sound like Mother Teresa.

After some very brief soul searching our trio decides life would be better without their bosses. However getting to that point is not easy. The movie takes some unexpected twists. The role of Dale (Charlie Day) was clearly written with Zach Galifianakis in mind. In spite of that, this was still an excellent movie. Good laughs, and an enjoyment to see Aniston as ""R"" rated.

F-bomb, crude sex talk (mostly by Aniston)",1310774400,,1256,4.5
4367166,3,B004EPZ08E,"My feeling after seeing this movie was that it is silly, adolescent, vulger & crude, but that it is pushed (just barely) up into the level of 3 stars by its all-star cast (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Ferrell and Jason Bateman).  Of course, many people can relate to having bad bosses, and fleeting thoughts of knocking them off sometime.  So our modern three stooges (three 30-something middle-class guys) each have a bad boss: Spacey is the arrogant bastard boss, Ferrell is the selfish druggie boss, and Aniston is the overly sexual female boss.  Each is over-the-top unrealistic.  Actually the whole movie feels over-the-top (I guess that Hollywood thinks they have to do everything that way -- like hitting you in the face with a mallet.)  But Spacey does play a very effective flaming jerk, ultra-arrogant, rich guy, and Ferrell a flaming jerk, coke-head, and Aniston a flaming jerk nympho dentist.

The guys decide to knock off each other's boss and things get out of control.  Really, the plot is just a vehicle to run a number of gags & jokes.  Like breaking into the druggy's house & spilling his cocaine all over the place & sweeping it up with a dust-buster.  Like hiring a ""hit man"" from ""men seeking men"" in the local paper and learning that he's got other things on his mind.  Like going to a black bar in a seedy part of town and hiring a scary-looking ex-con named ""M********r Jones"", and our silly, wimpy stooges calling him by his name all the time.  Like getting an Indian guy on the GPS help line in the car, named ""Gregory"" because his real name is unpronounceable (Gregory plays a big role at the end though).

Everything is exceedingly stupid, but it hits the funnybone about half the time.  The three stooges have pretty good comedic chemistry.  Aniston does add a lot of stimulation by showing off her (pretty darn sexy)  body in different stages of undress in a psycho-nympho role .... that old adolescent Hollywood trick works all the time I guess.  Then there's the old ""who would get raped worse in jail?"" supposedly humorous discussion ... there's nothing better for yucking things up than prison rape jokes!  Then there's the old ""we are three white goofy buffoons talking to a cool black guy who calls us morons and rips us off"" situation.  i.e. self-abasement by the immature and non-streetwise white men is supposed to be hilarious (or maybe it's just a Hollywood requirement if there are blacks & whites together in a movie.)  But the abasement goes both ways, due to the first name of the black ex-con, which has to be the most despicable word in the English language.

So there's a lot of low-class humor in this movie.  Actually, I get pretty tired of the F-word interjected into half of the lines in the movie by its end.  Don't the writers, who are supposedly the best in the country and very well paid, have any more literary talent than to say ""F-this, F-that, F-ing F"" all the time in order to get laughs?  Well, OK, that's what to expect from a modern R-rated comedy.",1310601600,4,3021,4.658490566037736
4367167,4,B004EPZ08E,"Before I went to see ""Horrible Bosses,"" I read a review which said that the movie celebrates the stereotypes it wanted to mock, and thus was not as subversive as it wished to be.  Luckily, I'm not capable of that level of sophisticated analysis, nor do I expect much out of a comedy released in July, so I found the movie very funny.

 Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play three put-upon employees with evil bosses who regularly get together to commiserate.  At one point, someone suggests murder would be a good solution to their problems, and another suggests that if they murder each other's bosses, no one will be able to trace it.  Their bosses include a sexually predatory dentist  (Jennifer Aniston channeling Demi Moore in ""Disclosure""); a twerpy amoral cokehead (Colin Farrell with a bad comb-over) and a company president who plays head games (Kevin Spacey, much better in ""Swimming With Sharks"").  Because they don't have much experience with this sort of thing, they wind up hiring Jamie Foxx.  Because Foxx's character (whose name I can't give here) doesn't either, things start to go awry.

Those who've seen the eighties' movie ""9 to 5"", starring Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, will recognize the storyline.  There are some Y2K twists, however, particularly at the end.  This movie, though, isn't trying to make any deep statements on gender politics in the workplace.  It's just trying to entertain.

I want to offer the heretical theory that most people enjoy seeing bullies get their just desserts, regardless of gender.  That's why I laughed at the movie, not because I think it's okay for women to harass men in the workplace or vice versa.  But if high jinks involving bodily fluids leave you cold, or politically incorrect humor makes you boil, then you should skip this one.",1310601600,4,1822,4.8892508143322475
4367168,4,B004EPZ08E,"This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It had the right amount of dark humor. Bateman, Sudeikis, and Day were perfect together, even though Day was probably the most annoying character because of his whiny voice. Three friends hate their manipulative bosses and decide to hire a hitman to kill them. They get MF Jones to be their murder consultant. They break into each boss's house and figure out how to kill them. Will they go thru with it? I highly recommend HORRIBLE BOSSES!!!",1310515200,,491,4.655172413793103

It might just be my age, but I thought Jennifer Aniston's role a little degrading, was surprised that she would do this part, but all in all, I really enjoyed this film. I needed a good laugh and this certainly did the job. I liked it even better than Hangover. All fairness, I have not seen the #2.",1310428800,2,363,4.126760563380282
4367170,2,B004EPZ08E,"Three friends come together and decide to eliminate their respective work supervisors, whom they all hate, for different reasons. This is another in a long line of modern-day comedies containing coarse language throughout, which does have its place (see Superbad), but at times is used to replace good comedy. In this case, the problem I have with the film is that it just isn't as funny as it should be. The movie has a strong cast, and they almost make it work. The movie does have its moments, but when the outtakes during the closing credits are funnier than the movie you just watched, you know that it was not all that good.",1310428800,8,630,4.584070796460177
4367171,5,B004EPZ08E,"In first part of film you get to see the working place of three friends and the horrible types of bosses in each one.  Then their scheme to get rid of these terrible bosses is what get really good.  In the theater where I saw the film people were laughing their heads off. I heard one group of ""older"" young adults (not teens, much older than that) laughing and repeating the lines and gags all after and during the closing credits and even staying till the very end of those enjoying themselves repeating the funny moments.  I also heard them say they couldn't wait to see the film again.

I loved Kevin Spacey's portrayal of terribe brutal dictatorial boss.  Someone you really wanted to hate. I was entertained by Jennifer Anniston's portrayal of a DDS always sexually harrassing her male assistant who was engaged to be married soon. Colin Farrel as the cokehead and playbay son of the one beloved boss in the group (soon to take over the company should anything happen to Kiefer Sutherland, his dad) really good too.  I didn't recognize him until the crdits revealed him as he looked so different.

Although I am now retired after 37 years of working on same job under an assortment of bosses, I found it very funny and a lot of fun.  Of course, pure fantasy, but so many crazy things kept happening it was much better than I thought it would be going in.

The one person on here giving such a negative review does not echo the reaction of the  group of adults filling the theater where I went to see it last Saturday afternoon.",1310428800,2,1533,4.482014388489208
4367172,4,B004EPZ08E,"If you're like most people at some point you have probably worked for a horrible boss, and so you can derive a vicarious thrill from this movie.

If you have seen Hitchcock's classic Strangers on a Train, or Throw Momma from the Train starring Danny De Vito the premise will be familiar.  Subtract a train, substitute 3 authority figures for a parental figure, add a healthy dose of  Murphy's law, and a hitman consultant, MF Jones, played by Jamie Foxx, and a few absurd twists, and you have Horrible Bosses.

Three horrible bosses.  Three disgruntled employess.  You kill my boss.  I kill yours.  No one will suspect any of us.  Makes perfect sense.  Nothing could possibly go wrong.  Right?  Right..

Horrible Bosses has a wealth of talent, including two Academy Award winners.  It's amusing, gripping, absurd, and has some surprising twists and turns.

It has some outstanding scenes, particularly Jennifer Aniston's hot portrayal of the oversexed over the top maneating dentist, who does unthinkable things with her sleeping patients, and tries the patience of her unfortunate just got engaged assistant.  Not just a sexual overtone.  More like a sexual symphony.

Last year she was in a clever movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Switch-2010/dp/B004P000BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Switch (2010)</a>, also starring Jason Bateman, and a scene stealing kid, and it's apparent that comedy more than drama is her strength and passion, and improvisation her forte as she showed in the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Go-With-It/dp/B0051BX8QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Go With It</a>, which I totally loved.  For her the clock appears to run backwards rather than forwards, and her talent and presence continues to grow.

Combed over Colin Farrell is almost unrecognisable as the idiotic heir to a chemical company with chemical dependency issues, while Kevin Spacey reprises the familiar psychotic role.

If you like this movie, check out director Seth Gordon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-Kong-A-Fistful-of-Quarters/dp/B000XQ4HR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters</a>, given two thumbs up by Ebert and Roeper.  Think of it as the Spinal Tap meets Donkey Kong. Truly outstanding.

If you're like me, it doesn't matter if you watch it in the theater or on dvd, I think you will love it.  And, if you do have a horrible boss, send him or her a copy of this movie.  They might get the hint.  They might not get the hint.

4367173,4,B004EPZ08E,"Horrible Bosses is a revenge fantasy on acid or better yet, a snort of cocaine. It's obscene. It's politically incorrect. It's boorish and absolutely hilarious. Everyone seems to have having a good time, especially the horrible bosses played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell. Colin Farrell seems to be channeling Tom Cruise's performance from Tropic Thunder. He's completely unrecognizable as the kung fu obsessed tool of a boss, Bobby Pellit. Of course, no one does smarm better than Kevin Spacey. He's played this type of role before but never with so much glee. As for Jennifer Aniston, she is fabulous as the nymphomaniac dentist who lusts after her hygienist.

The premise is very simple. Three under paid, under appreciated and over worked employees played by Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day decide that if they want their lives to improve, they need to murder their bosses. Thus begins the clever and very rude homage to Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train as well as Throw Mama From the Train.

It's an intelligent, witty and extremely well written movie. What made it more fun were unexpected cameos by Ioan Gruffudd and Bob Newhart. Ioan Gruffudd's scene as a potential assassin for hire is a riot.
