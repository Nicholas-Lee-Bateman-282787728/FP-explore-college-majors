3508688,5,B001CD6LK2,"I normally do not buy DVDs, let alone write a review, but after watching this documentary I had to buy it just to show support for the director and bboying.

I read the product details and was expecting a bare-bones DVD but was pleasantly surprised with a 30 minute bonus feature ""More On bboying"" that goes even more in-depth into the history of bboying (i.e. Rocksteady Crew, ""Flash Dance"", and the European evolution of breakin).  The bonus feature alone is worth the purchase of this DVD.",1229644800,4,492,4.709302325581396
3508689,5,B001CD6LK2,"Had no problem getting it cheaper and faster than getting it straight from the distributor's site. I had a hell of a time dealing with Arts Alliance America. Order through Amazon unless you like dealing with no customer service and a higher price. As for the DVD, it was awesome. It was amazing to see how far breaking has come and the unbelievable tricks B-Boys are doing, from all over the world. Definitely worth checking out. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, but see it.",1229385600,,469,4.529411764705882
3508690,5,B001CD6LK2,"Man, one of the best documentary I've ever seen.  The filming, the character development, the storyline....and not to mention the breakdancing.  It blows all crews I've ever seen away.  Again, you guys won't be disappointed at all!!!",1226880000,,233,5.243243243243243
3508691,5,B001CD6LK2,"I saw this in New York when it played theatrically.  I was skeptical at first that this wouldn't be anything more than a highlight reel but I quickly found out that's not true.  Planet B-Boy delves into the subculture of b-boying (breakdancing) and shows that it's not only a hobby, it's a lifestyle.  It follows crews from all over the world who are brought together by the love of expression by means of ""B-Boying"" and ultimately to the ""World Series"" of B-boying, ""The Battle of the Year"" which is an International competition featuring the best dance crews in the world. It is absolutely amazing to see these people defy the laws of gravity and do the physically impossible.",1224115200,19,678,4.728813559322034
3508692,5,B001CD6LK2,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it was making its US tour.  It was really really awesome.  It wasn't just about b-boying but also about the guys and their stories.  But of course, the dancing is insanity and a must-watch.

Oh... the American crew in the movie (Knucklehead Zoo) has some members that are also in Super Crew- winners of MTV's America's Best Dance Crew Season 2.",1219881600,11,382,4.492753623188406
3508693,5,B001CD6LK2,I went online and checked out the trailer and BELIEVE ME it'll be worth the wait... PEACE!,1215734400,,90,4.352941176470588
3508694,5,B001CD6LK2,"Hip-hop is the tribal arts brought to modern light, and this shows a great deal of the head spinning b-boys. If you're into the hip-hop culture, then this is a must watch.",1388880000,,171,4.375
3508695,2,B001CD6LK2,"I am not sure if the adults who said this was a family movie, watched the entire movie until the end. It was a great show until the competition at the end because every swear word in the book was used in multiple languages. What's worse? The swear words were very helpfully translated into English so my 7 and 8 year old could read it.

NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN.",1388102400,,366,4.304347826086956
3508696,5,B001CD6LK2,so i purchased this for my three yr old who has showed some interest in dance i want him to c all forms of dance. i was worried that it would be stereotype like baggy clothes and profanity i also got hip hop for kids which was total stereotype. but this was so good it.we will enjoy this vidoe together as he grows.,1382140800,,315,4.015873015873016
3508697,5,B001CD6LK2,"The story behind break dancing, told through stories of multiple dynamic personalities. Great routines, good beats, and a positive message make it a definitive winner. It'll keep you engrossed from beginning to end.",1379635200,,215,5.545454545454546

3508699,5,B001CD6LK2,"I had no idea about the history of breaking and hip hop until I saw Planet B-Boy. It's a great view into a subculture that is brimming with dedicated artists that kick ass at what they do. Good stuff, fun watch.",1377648000,,211,4.170731707317073
3508700,1,B001CD6LK2,Really boring and lame. All kind of different languages and subtitles and family stories I really don't care about. A bunch of old bums who live in NYC talking about being a big thing in the mid 80's,1375315200,,199,4.2631578947368425
3508701,5,B001CD6LK2,"I've seen this documentary several times and love it.  if you're into the bboy thing, its pretty interesting.  Maybe I love it more because it is about my people.",1367020800,,162,4.551724137931035
3508702,5,B001CD6LK2,A Must have for all who love the Hip Hop Culture!~ Inspiring Movie for all B-Boys & B-Girls To watch!~,1360195200,,102,4.15
3508703,4,B001CD6LK2,So inspiring! I can watch Japan a million times and never get tired of them.  A really great movie that shows so much heart and determination of these crews. An inspiration for dancers.,1359331200,,185,4.606060606060606
3508704,5,B001CD6LK2,"Korean-American director Benson Lee does a good job of weaving a dramatic Asian-centric storyline into this profile of an quintessentially romantic but angst-driven male adolescent activity.  The film follows five breakdancing (b-boying) dance teams (2 from South Korea, 1 from Japan, 1 from France, 1 from USA) that have been selected to participate in the annual Battle of the Year dance competition in Germany.  Because this is meant for the American market (where it did well in theaters) there's a lot of emphasis on the American team, but really the two starring roles belong to the teams from South Korea and Japan.  The two South Korean teams display a fanatical dedication and work ethic that is indicative of their culture, but the Japanese surprisingly display a passion and a love that one wouldn't associate with Japanese culture.  In fact, the Japanese team pointed out that the last time they participated in Battle of the Year they were focused on winning, and that's why they performed so badly -- this time around they want to express how much they love b-boying.

Oddly enough, the Battle of the Year has become of late a proxy battle stage between the two historical antagonists -- Japan and South Korea.  It'd be interesting to see a documentary exploring this.",1343520000,,1282,4.9672897196261685
3508705,5,B001CD6LK2,I ordered this as part of a multiple order.  The DVD was the first item to arrive in two days!  Extremely fast.,1315526400,,111,4.0
3508706,5,B001CD6LK2,"This is a great documentary style film. It is not just dancing the entire time.  It's a story about getting into and competing in ""Battle of the Year.""  If you have any appreciation at all for movement or for being passionate about something; then you should see this.  It's amazing how many people from all over the world are b-boying strong.  The bonus footage of about 25 minutes is of original b-boys talking about their experiences and some of the history.  All of the interviews are sincere and you can really see the emotion regarding the lifestyle; particularly from Mr. Freeze and Ken Swift.  FYI, Storm is on here as a judge and commentator...love him, but he wears a funny shirt ;)",1288742400,,692,4.631147540983607
3508707,5,B001CD6LK2,"I heard this was really good. When I heard about this movie I thought about that new song ""Up Rock"" by Clok. I love that song",1288051200,,125,3.8461538461538463
3508708,4,B001CD6LK2,"This DVD is amazing.  I'm a HUGE Bboy fan.  It's about the International Bboy championships!  Teams from all over the world.  It's more than just dance shots, you learn what all the kids go through with families and respective countries to live the BBOY life! Before there was ABDC, there was Planet BBOY.",1285632000,,305,4.69811320754717
3508709,5,B001CD6LK2,Just watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about. I bought this DVD for my collection and not taking it out anytime soon,1279238400,,124,4.208333333333333
3508710,5,B001CD6LK2,"I got this dvd on a whim and was far from disappointed.  The interview footage really makes the dancers come off as people who love what they're doing, and that becomes more and more evident as the fact that they often receive little or no recognition (or at times almost ill treatment) in their home countries.  I found myself rooting for the little guys as much as everyone else, and the personalities of not only the countries comes through, as well as the dancers.  Culture plays a part in the storytelling aspects of B-Boy, but at the end of the day, they all love to dance.  Everyone wants to win, but at the same time, they're much more humble than a professional athlete ever seems. Overall, a tremdendously well done doc on a form of dance that is becoming more and more commercial.  This one still feels like down-home good times even with the successes and failures of the crews and the individual members throughout the training process and Battle of the Year.  Absolutely recommended for any fan of dance.",1274918400,2,1018,4.627777777777778

3508713,5,B001CD6LK2,"I first saw Planet B-Boy in the theater when it came to L.A., on its first day. My son breakdances, it came out shortly after Step Up 2, and I thought it seemed like an indie film worth supporting. It was so much more. For people who are really into this, the heart of the dancers on the teams is completely inspiring. So are their moves. So is the worldwide influence of what started as streetdancing in the U.S. The archival footage is great as well.

The physicality of the moves in this movie really is like being taken to school. The different flavors and styles of the teams provoke all kinds of choreography thoughts. The music is fantastic, and it all comes together. As soon as I knew it was out on DVD, I bought one copy for myself and one copy for a hiphop/rap/breakdancing fan at work. This movie has so much love of dance. If you have a heart for this kind of expression, you'll feel it too.",1231718400,8,904,4.286549707602339
