2864908,5,B000RETOHY,"My all time favorite movies of Martin Scorsese, finally on one collection box set. All 3 blu-ray disc is pack with a lot of special features, three languages (English, Spanish and francais) and the quality of the image is amazing. A great gift.",1343347200,,244,4.6976744186046515
2864909,4,B000RETOHY,"Goodfellas and The Departed are great, wish the third film was something else (Raging Bull, or Taxi Driver). But you probably know the films. The versions are solid. It's funny, they all must have been stripped from advanced sets because very disc says disc 1 on it. Basically that means their isn't much for extras. Some decent commentary on Goodfellas, nothing on The Departed. This is just a stripped down compilation. Solid price (at least when I bought it).",1266192000,8,462,4.860759493670886
2864910,5,B000RETOHY,"Obviously, a sensational package for longtime Scorsese fans or casual fans who like ""a good movie"". You've got a Classic, ""Goodfellas""; a near-Classic, ""Aviator"", and a wanna-be Classic, ""The Departed"", ironically, the one to finally win an Oscar for the Director.
Nothing in Life is perfect and even ""Goodfellas"" had an overproduced soundtrack - I guess MTV was in full swing - not that the music was interpolated poorly. ""Aviator"", mostly about Howard Hughes' life in flying, was too long, had an over-studied (but effective) ""Kate Hepburn"" and a slightly obscure treatment of ""Jane Russell""; plus some of the script anachronisms were almost funny; also, DiCaprio seems to age about six years out of 20: 1927 to 1947.
I found the opening scene, involving a ""Germophobic"" Mother, somewhat confusing. By the end of the movie, we understand that Howard Hughes, was probably a victim of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which current research says is congenital, not something conditioned. Gotta ruminate on that for a while: were the movie-makers saying that it ran in the family or that his quest for purification was based upon a childhood memory?
Problems abound with ""The Departed"" (unofficial alternate title: ""The Mean Streets Of Boston""), as no-one is as they seem. That, in itself, shouldn't *be* a problem, but here it gets out of hand. Nicholson is the conflicted ""Boss""; Sheen is the conflicted ""Sergeant""; DiCaprio is the undercover guy; Damon is the corrupt climber who takes over for Sheen, who watches DiCaprio. DiCaprio and Damon look like first Cousins - curious casting.
Nicholson looks more like Attila The Hun than the expected underworld sophisticate. His mistress is a radical feminist - believable? No.
Forgot to mention that DiCaprio's ""Shrink"", Vera Farmiga, can be cajoled into writing prescriptions, convinced that sleeping with a patient is appropriate, and that moving in with Damon is fitting.
I think Scorsese got a little lazy on this one: he must have watched ""Goodfellas"" with DiCaprio one too many times and possibly over-sold the idea of copying Ray Liotta. A great imitation, though. Boy, did I miss Paul Sorvino!
Special Features on ""Goodfellas"" is especially exciting, as it features a running commentary with the Director, the Cionematographer, DeNiro, Sorvino, Bracco, Liotta, the ""real"" Henry Hill and the ""real"" Prosecutor, Ed McDonald (who played himself in the film!), plus a combination of the real and movie Hills! At times, Henry Hill's narration will have you spellbound, as he ""relives"" events. By the way, I was unaware that so many scenes were ""close to home"".
Overall, this DVD set is a gem. Good for the movie buff *and* his/her billfold.",1231718400,4,2689,5.169724770642202

All 3 with incredible actors and support staff and to be formatted in BluRay--what more could you ask for--it couldn't be better in person!!  Except for the humor that comes with these guys!  If you have ever watched the outtakes--I would love to be on a set of one of these films!!  I know from being Italian, I wish I grew up in NYC back in the day, my Grand Father was Mafia here in town & wrote the numbers, ran the local club & had the respect.  I see these movies that Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro & others play in or hear the stories Mr. De Niro & Mr. Scorsese talk about life in NYC, I wish I could have been there or even go there on a memory trip with them!",1402444800,,818,4.062111801242236

2864983,4,B000RETOHY,the only reason I gave it 4 outta 5 stars is because I haven't seen THE AVIATOR yet. THE DEPARTED and GOODFELLAS go without saying. Unbeatable deal for the movies you get on Blu-Ray,1375056000,,181,4.352941176470588

2864985,1,B000RETOHY,"I'm not sure what happened here. I ordered this triple feature as it seemed like a great deal. However, upon arrival and opening, I noticed only one disc was included which was the aviator. After reading all of the reviews, three discs for the three separate movies were supposed to have been what I ordered. Maybe it's just one of those batches where one in a thousand are defected and/or not complete and I just happened to get that one.",1370476800,,439,4.5

2864988,5,B000RETOHY,"""Goodfellas"" is hands down my favorite gangster flick. Truth be told, it's pretty much the only gangster flick I like. I thought ""The Aviator"" was gorgeous. Sumptuous design, dynamic photography, and of course an enduringly enigmatic subject. ""The Departed"" is not one of my favorite Scorcese pictures, which is not to say I didn't like it. But getting all of these movies on separate blu ray discs in one set for a bargain price was impossible to pass up. Even if I absolutely hated ""The Departed"", getting the other two films was well worth the price of admission. Step up Scorsese fans  this a deal!",1364688000,,602,4.733333333333333

2865001,5,B000RETOHY,"I'm not such a big fan of the other two films, but at this price, who's complaining. Aviator & Departed are both good movies, but Goodfellas is in a class all by itself. Yes, it is violent, but when the performances are in this range, I can live with some over the top carnage. Everyone excels in one of Martin Scorsese's finest. Simply everything about this movie works perfectly; the acting, cinematography, direction, editing, narration, period detail, music...all this and two other movies that you'll enjoy. This one repays repeated viewing.",1361059200,,546,5.010989010989011

2865004,5,B000RETOHY,I paid 9.99 for this product which includes all three movies on seperate disks. You sacrifice the lack of individual packaging but when you consider the incredible price it's worth it.,1360886400,,184,4.967741935483871

2865007,4,B000RETOHY,Three good films for a good price.  Can't go wrong with a Scorsese film...most of the time.  Good Fellas alone is a classic.,1359936000,,124,4.3478260869565215
2865008,4,B000RETOHY,I'm not a Dicapprio fan and would have rather seen another another Scorsese  third title....that aside  and at the Amazon price buying this package is a no brainier. Quality of the disks is excellent.,1359849600,,200,4.852941176470588
2865009,5,B000RETOHY,"What can you say about Martin Scorsese that has not already been said? 3 amazing movies in one combo pack, a must buy for any movie buff. Only downside for me is take out the Aviator and substitute it for maybe Taxi Driver, Casino, Cape Fear, Mean Streets, or Raging Bull? idk but with so many classics from one man who cares what the 3 movies are cuz they are all a good watch. Blu-ray quality makes a difference as well.",1359763200,,422,4.222222222222222

2865016,5,B000RETOHY,"GoodFellas is one of my favorite movies of all time (IMDB #15) - to get it, Departed (IMDB #51), and Aviator (above average)  movies together on blu-ray for the price of 1 movie is a great value.",1357603200,,195,4.27027027027027

2865018,4,B000RETOHY,"Goodfellas is great, The Departed is good and The Aviator is fair.  But why is Shannon Tweed listed as the star?  I notice she is listed as the star for a lot of movies on Amazon, and I don't think she's even in any of them.",1357084800,,224,3.847826086956522

2865020,5,B000RETOHY,When buying a set like this you have to have little expectations for packaging.  I will say I was very pleased to see each movie had it's own disc.  Furthermore the artwork on the discs appear to be the same as if you bought the original.  Note I have three of these sets and they are all like this.  I'm very pleased.,1356566400,2,318,4.080645161290323

2865024,5,B000RETOHY,"I was skeptical to get this one because I was not clear if this was a 3-IN-ONE disk or three separate disks. Luckily, its three separate discs for each movie. Crystal clear and must watch movies.",1354147200,12,195,4.444444444444445
2865025,4,B000RETOHY,"Warner Brothers has recently released a number of Bluray ""triple features"", which are available at pretty decent prices.  The Martin Scorsese Triple Feature contains&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M5AJQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>&nbsp;(2006),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GoodFellas/dp/B000LPS4BG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GoodFellas</a>&nbsp;(1990), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Aviator/dp/B000VZGK3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Aviator</a>&nbsp;(2004), with each film on an individual Bluray disc.  Be assured, the three films are not jammed on a single disc.

The quality of these films is widely recognized.  Martin Scorsese (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cape-Fear/dp/B005CA4SL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cape Fear</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino/dp/B001EIOOV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/B004AOECUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>) won an Academy Award for Best Director for The Departed, and the film won the Oscar for Best Film in 2006.  Goodfellas might be an even more highly regarded crime drama, and based on the life of Howard Hughes, The Aviator is also a critically acclaimed work.

I got this collection at Amazon for only ten bucks, at the initial offering.  The price has since increased, but if you don't own any of the films, this three Bluray set is still a pretty good deal, as there is some savings over buying the titles separately.  The Blurays are not ""movie only"" editions, as they each contain commentaries and other bonus material.  The Aviator in particular, is fully loaded with extras.  While each of the films looks great, The Aviator is particularly vibrant and colorful.  As the oldest among the films, Goodfellas might be less sharp visually, presented in 1.85:1, while the other two films are 2.4:1 letterboxed.

I also ordered the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers-Bluray-Triple-Feature/dp/B008MIMWOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers Bluray Triple Feature</a>&nbsp;for $10, which was another cool deal.  The prices of most of the other WB triple features has also increased, but if you check around, there could still be some pretty good deals to be found.",1353974400,38,2539,7.99288256227758
