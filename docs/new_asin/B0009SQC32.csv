8066249,5,B0009SQC32,Jaw dropping performance by Lucia Laccara .  I saw this on Public TV.  Had to buy it to share it with my friends and family.  There would be no way for me to do it justice with my own description.,1440633600,,196,3.85
8066250,4,B0009SQC32,"Great Dancers of Our Time, featuring the renowned dancers Vladimir Malakhov, Lucia Lacarra, and Kiyoko Kimura, displays the wealth and evolution of German ballet (where all of these dancers currently star). Vladimir Malakhov dances Manon with Diana Vishneva, Voyage, and Le Spectre de la rose with Nadja Saidakova. Lucia Lacarra dances the Swan Lake White Swan Pas de Deux with Cyril Pierre, Swan Lake White Swan Variation, and Lady of the Camellias with Cyril Pierre. Kiyoko Kimura dances various choreographies by Uwe Scholz, with partner Christopher Blm. Interwoven with various short interviews, the portraits of Malakhov and Lacarra are stunning. The DVD takes a disappointing turn with the choreographies of Scholz, danced by Kimura. These dances are jejune, as are her interviews.
I'd recommend the first two thirds of the DVD, where the dancers and choreographies are stunning. This is a must-have for any ballet fan, at least for the first two dancers.",1334361600,4,961,5.287581699346405
