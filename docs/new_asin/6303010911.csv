7834007,5,6303010911,"I remember watching this movie over and over when I discovered it for the first time at the age of 9. I loved it! =) It tells the story of Mia, a bratty little girl who never helps her mother out around the house and always seems to be getting into trouble. Determined to find a way to cure Mia, the mother goes to an magical old woman who gives her a book to read to Mia. This book is, of course, called ""Thumbelina"" and supposedly is guaranteed to turn Mia into a more obedient child. When her mother falls asleep while reading the book to Mia, Mia engages in the story herself and magically gets transported to the fascinating land in the book. Here, Mia meets some new friends and faces challenges that gradually affect her attitude and help her develop a better appreciation for her devoted mother. It's a cute story--nice animation and a good choice for kids. Buy it now =)",1019260800,5,879,4.365853658536586
