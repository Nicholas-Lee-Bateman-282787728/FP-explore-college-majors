8692972,4,B00QU0WAIO,"""The Haunting of Radcliffe House"" (UK title) was released in the US as ""Altar"". It features Olivia Williams as Meg Hamilton, an expert in restoration work who moves her family, comprising her artist husband Alec (played by Matthew Modine), and their two children, Penny and Harper from their home in London to an old, abandoned mansion called the Radcliffe House out on the Yorkshire Moors. The house has a reputation because of its grisly history and the local townspeople are not keen to help Meg work on restoring the mansion. Having no choice but to carry out the work on it by herself, Meg discovers strange things in the house, including a tiled floor in the root cellar that depicts an image attributed to the Rosicrucians. Teenager Penny gets eerie visitations by a female spirit who is all scarred, but none of the adults will believe her, attributing it to nightmares.

Over a period of time, even Meg begins to see and experience strange things although the skeptic in her tries to rationalize away her experiences. Then husband Alec begins to really go off the rails, working in secret at all hours on a new project that he refuses to let anyone else see. What exactly is happening to the Hamilton's?

I thought this was a pretty decent, highly atmospheric haunted house ghost story. The chills are there although they could have been better done. The story itself is nothing new except for the references to Rosicrucianism. There are parts of the story that reminded me of ""The Skeleton Key"". The cinematography of the serene yet eerie Yorkshire countryside is beautifully done and the house itself is a central character in the story and I enjoyed watching the story unfold in various key rooms in the house. The suspense factor is well built and the pacing for the most part is good. Final verdict: a bit derivative but the performances of the cast and the suspense do make for an engaging viewing experience.",1451692800,,1924,4.774774774774775
