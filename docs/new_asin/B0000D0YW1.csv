8323841,5,B0000D0YW1,"This is the tenth program in the Documents of Destiny series. While developing these programs, I have been exposed to various college professors and their dissertations on a very diverse spectrum of topics. Before I started editing educational programs, that sentence would have come out something like this: When I helped make these, I met a lot of really nice people that were totally smart. This is a perfect example of how candid I am and Priscilla Zotti from the U.S. Naval Academy found that to be very refreshing to see in someone in a place where everything is Yes Sir and No Mam and all the cadets must watch what they say. After interviewing professors, we often feel like we just gained a very good new friend and that feeling is compounded when we create the programs, often having to watch the recorded interview several times in the process. Priscilla Zotti really has become one of those really good friends. She is featured in seventeen Just The Facts titles. No, she's not tooting her horn, we love her! We tried to get her to speak about Early Man but the earliest man she knows about is John Locke. Anyway, she is an invaluable assett to the educational community. Here is her vitae.
Priscilla Machado Zotti is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the United States Naval Academy where she teaches classes in constitutional law, criminal justice, and civil rights and civil liberties. She received her Bachelor of Arts in political science and history from Baylor University where she also received a Master of Arts in political science. She completed a joint degree at The University of Texas at Austin in law and political science. Dr. Zotti's publications cover a wide range of topics, from judicial review, comparative search and seizure law, rehabilitation in military and civilian prisons, criminal sanctions and punishment. In addition to her publications, Dr. Zotti has been interviewed on public radio and in a series of videos produced for academic audiences on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. She is active in a number of professional organizations including the Supreme Court Historical Society, the American Political Science Association, and the Southwestern Social Science Association. She currently serves on the Executive Board of the Southwestern Political Science Association and is the Section Head for Constitutional Law and Jurisprudence of the American Political Science Association.
Documents of Destiny and other Just the Facts titles expose students to the teachings of various professors in esteemed universities that they might not otherwise have an opportunity to be exposed to in their educational experiences. Enjoy the Program!
