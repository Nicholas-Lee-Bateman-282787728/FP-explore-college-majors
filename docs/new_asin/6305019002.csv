My only regret is that I didn't see it when I was younger, when I  first learned about leprechauns. Lucky is SO cute! After Molly meets him  she has a dream where he is a very unlucky leprechaun, but when she awakens  she finds that he really is lucky after all.

957941,4,6305019002,"Nine-year old Molly moves to Ireland and enters into a world of leprechauns. One of them appears to her and promises her good luck. But one problem after another besets her in her new environment. Two bullying boys steal her lunch, and she gets blamed for the ensuing commotion. At another time, the bullies provoke a food fight, but she gets blamed for it. The leprechaun comes one night and releases a shooting star in her home. Instead of helping her, the shooting star tears the whole place up and then breaks a window in its exit out of the house. Guess who gets blamed for all the damage? Certainly not the leprechaun, in whom the father does not believe.

Molly's father realizes that she has gone through a lot in the last year and a half. She lost her mother, all her friends, and was forced to leave her home in Chicago and move to Ireland with her dad. He supposes that Molly is living in her fantasy world of leprechauns as a result of her difficult experiences.  He believes that she is blaming her disruptive behavior on leprechauns as an escape from responsibility for her actions.

Then there is a cart race. The leprechaun lifts and carries the cart with Molly, named the Rainbow Racer, airborne to near the finish line. Molly wins the race, but then gets disqualified because she and her cart were not seen at a cross point. Molly is heartbroken. The leprechaun has caused her nothing but trouble. She decides to ask the leprechaun to stop seeing her. What's more, her father is about to lose their new home owing to a severe financial liability incurred by the former owner.

Will the leprechaun still come? And with good luck at last? Will he help Molly? Will he enable the father to save ownership of his and Molly's new home? Will Molly catch the leprechaun and get the pot of gold? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.",1173225600,7,1849,4.51044776119403
