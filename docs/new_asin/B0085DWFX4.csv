8525523,5,B0085DWFX4,"Fantastic DVD of a great show - unmissable. SCANDAL at the Budokan, perhaps not the biggest but surely the most prestigious venue in all Japan. When they appear on stage the first thing that grabs you (or it did me anyway) is their bizarre outfits (mix a dash of Japanese traditional with British punk & patterned tights & gift-wrap it). Then their hair would raise an eyebrow for those of us accustomed to seeing them in standard long & black Japanese school-girl cuts. Only RINA seems basically unchanged - TOMOMI has gone brunette-ish & piled-up, HARUNA streaky blonde & looks like she's been pulled through a hedge backwards & MAMI has gone completely blonde with her hair pulled right back off her face in a sort of sideways pony-tail & she looks absolutely stunning. For too long we've never seemed to get to see MAMI's face much on stage as she always seems to have a curtain of black hair obscuring it, especially when she's hunched over her guitar laying down those ruthless riffs & soaring solos we all love so much, but now we can appreciate just how lovely she really is.
The next thing I noticed about this performance is that, at last, someone's got the sound of SCANDAL live just right. Club Quattro (SCANDAL FIRST LIVE Tour DVD - see my Review of this DVD of Feb 2011 on Amazon.jp) was small & basic with a p.a. to match. At Zepp Tokyo (TEMPTATION BOX Tour DVD) the sound had too much treble gain & came out a bit thin & tinny sometimes, with RINA's drums, I noticed, flat & two-dimentional. The guys at Budokan have got the balance spot-on. TOMOMI's bass deep & clear, HARUNA's guitar work punchier & MAMI's lead is given the authority & power it deserves - & what a revelation, she's always been good, but she plays here with so much style & confidence - no more hiding behind her fringe - she seems to have really matured by changing her image. And RINA can trash hell out of her drums without worrying about swamping the front three.
They kick the show off with their introductory ""SCANDAL Theme"" & segue into the rousing rocker ""Sentimental Moment"", showing the girls are in sparkling form, & then follow it with a superb ""EVERYBODY SAY YEAH"" & it's a joy to see TOMOMI playing with her left foot up on her monitor speaker in her usual un-ladylike manner & a self-assured HARUNA strolling down the run-way, the huge audience in the palm of her hand, making sure the house is rocking. You know it's going to be one helluva show.
After a short introductory interval (& TOMOMI switches to her customised blue Squier Bass) they launch into ""BEAUteen"" (a crowd-pleaser but never been one of my favourites) followed by an excellent classic ""Girl S"" & a rollicking ""LOVE SURVIVE"". They give ""Hi! Hi! Hi!"" a great new heavy metal intro, which makes me wonder if that isn't a direction that's well worth pursuing.
I'm a bit ambivalent about ""RINA's drum SOLO"". It's obvious she's improved, she's more fluid, hitting harder, & it's good to see she's got the confidence to get out there & do it, but it's not something that drummers do very much nowadays. On top of that she spends too much time pouting & preening & making doe-eyes at the cameras. She knows she's cute & we know that she's cute, but she shouldn't overdo things. This item is followed by the rest of the group taking the stage having thrown on tokko fuku (long jackets embroidered with heavy kanji symbols much favoured by outlaw biker gangs) & miming to ""SCANDAL Nanka Buttobase"" (I could never work out the translation of this but I'm told it means ""Sending Scandals Flying""). Personally I would have preferred them to play & sing normally as I don't rate their formation dancing abilities & what's the point of doing a live show & miming?
This is followed by RINA taking the stage again on her own, flashing a bit of thigh & regaling the audience with a five minute monologue. The rest of the gang then re-appears & indulges in another ten minutes of seemingly pointless banter during which TOMOMI is handed a presentation cheque for 152,000 yen (about 1050). No idea what it's all about.
However, after another costume & instrument change (TOMOMI goes back to her Fender Jazz Bass, HARUNA her (now seldom used) Telecaster Standard & MAMI (curiously) a Squier Jazzmaster (these guitars have got odd shaped bodies for people who prefer to play sitting down)for a bouncy rendition of the popular number ""Pride"". For the next number (on the DVD at least) they've had another quick instrument change & HARUNA is using her more usual Telecaster Thinline Deluxe & MAMI lugs a massively impressive Gretsch White Falcon. She used this guitar for ""After School - 1 Hour"", ""Switch"" & ""Tears of Regret"" on the ""TEMPTATION BOX Tour"" DVD but it sounded too twangy & she loked very uncomfortable playing it. None of that here - she handles it like a professional PLUS she looks so good playing it. This lightweight number (""Distant"") segues into delightfully dark & doleful ""BURN"" featuring emotion-wracked vocals from HARUNA & outstandingly soulful lead guitar from MAMI. Her guitar solo in the middle is so magically restrained & delicate, almost ethereal, that it makes your hair stand on end & in stark contrast her incredible sustained heavy Nirvana-esque outro is just brilliant. This, to me, is the stand-out number of the set & clearly demonstrates SCANDAL's versatility & the breadth of their musical abilities. The sweet but undemanding ""Switch"" is followed by more gut-wrenching stuff as HARUNA & TOMOMI wring their hearts out in the vocals for ""I Want You"", whose initial easy-going vibes builds up into an impressive crescendo from TOMOMI before the final haunting refrains from HARUNA.
This is followed by a light & summery ""Spring Breeze"" & that popular paean to lost school-days penned by TOMOMI to celebrate herself & MAMI graduating from high school ""Goodbye Cherry Blossoms"". This, incidentally, features some amazing finger work from TOMOMI, as she plays her bass more like a guitar. I've only seen this style once before & that was a super-cool Japanese girl from Osaka playing bass with a blues band in a juke joint on Beale St in Memphis, Tennessee !! A more lively & up-beat ""Hello! Hello!"" gets the crowd cheering & is followed by the curiously named ""The Story that You & the Sun Drew"" which is another summery crowd-pleaser that gets the audience jumping up & down. These three songs are clearly the build-up for the group's rightly immensely popular signature tune ""SCANDAL BABY"". Accompanied by showers of silver foil for everyone to wave, it is a thoroughly enjoyable - even heart-warming - experience. The audience loves it, the girls love playing it & everybody has a great time leaping up & down.
So ends the main set.
But, to some, the girls may have saved the best 'til last. Coming out for their encore having made their traditional change into T-shirts, they abandon their set positions on stage & come to the front of the run-way with their guitars & RINA with a stripped-down drum-kit. After a bit of banter HARUNA raises her arm & bellows ""Space Ranger"" & the crowd roars as they launch into a brilliant rendition of this solid gold SCANDAL classic. No pedal boards, no added instrumentation, just guitar & drum power, almost as if they were back busking in Osaka Castle Park again. They follow this up with a searing ""Dragonfly"" (another of their classics) & to top everything off their final song is the brilliant rocker ""DOLL"". So impressive.
Although I have my reservations about ""RINA's drum SOLO"", & ""SCANDAL Nanka Buttobase"" &, from a non-Japanese speaker's point of view, the overlong talky bits, the rest is pure SCANDAL magic. The quality of their playing is fantastic, their stage-work & rapport with the audience is a joy to behold &, if further proof was needed, this amply demonstrates that SCANDAL must be the top all-girl rock band in Japan",1359590400,2,7862,4.735229759299781
8525524,5,B0085DWFX4,"I wish this was actually released here, but as long as there's a product page on Amazon for it, I'm going to review it!

Since there's no real product description here, this disc contains SCANDAL's sold out March 2012 concert at the famed Budokan in Tokyo, Japan.  Playing Budokan is a special event in Japan reserved for only the most popular artists, and Scandal were the fastest girl group ever to be able to do so (yes, they keep statistics for this sort of thing there - Scandal did it something like 4+ years after their debut).  Because it's considered such an honor, most bands that play there dress in special costumes for the event - for example, Kimura Kaela and her band all wore tuxedos.  A lot of westerners don't quite get this custom, as the pedigree of Budokan is not well known here, and consequently western bands that play there mostly ignore it and wear the same clothes they always do.

But Scandal did as Japanese bands do and wore some very outlandish and super-cute costumes, with two wardrobe changes during the show.  Haruna even wore circle lenses - her closeups make her look almost like an anime character!  I mention this only because the band's previous DVD's all had them wearing some variation of their standard schoolgirl uniforms, but by this concert they'd graduated generally to more adult-styled short skirts and tops, and they really went full-on crazy with the fashion for this show.  If you don't know the custom and how special playing Budokan is considered there, you'll think they've just gone nuts with their costumes.

The show begins with a special tongue-in-cheek film that celebrates Budokan's roots (and still main function) as a fighting and wrestling arena - that's where the ""title match"" comes in.  The film pits Scandal against Budokan itself, with interviews and ""training"" segments showing them getting ready for the fight.  The first song, Scandal's Theme, opens to some huge pyrotechnics, and it's followed by the great Shunkan Sentimental and then Everybody Say Yeah! - three high-energy songs that really got the crowd going right from the start.  You can feel the energy even on the DVD/BD disc, especially with the whole crowd jumping and yelling ""yeah!"" during Everybody Say Yeah!  The song was made for live shows.

The middle of the show tones it down for some slower songs, and the band almost seems to take a break - not moving around as much, keeping to their marks on stage.  Repeated viewings brings appreciation for these songs, however, as their proficiency as musicians really comes through.  ""Haruka"" has literally never sounded better than it does here, stripped of most of its keyboards and turned into a straight guitar rock song.  Similarly, ""Burn"" is just amazing, with Haruna really belting it out as it's not even apparent on the album that she could - it gives me goosebumps hearing that song on this disc.  She has become a truly great rock singer.

In fact, while it was obvious in their early days that they were still learning their craft, all of the band's members sound like total professionals on this disc.  If anyone doubted the singing or playing ability of Scandal, just watch this show.  They have become as good of musicians as any rock band I can think of.  Haruna's voice gives me chills, Mami's leads are effortless, Tomomi's bass playing is both technically difficult *and* flawless, and Rina even gets her own drum solo!  It's a long solo too, and one that I expected to be cut down for the disc, but it isn't - it's the full solo as we all saw it in the arena.  She has become a very strong and powerful drummer.  This is now a confident band compromised of four legitimate rock stars.

In fact, the only parts left out of the disc are some of the instrument changes between songs.  There's a *long* ""MC"" segment, for example, where the band do a skit making fun of Tomomi that lasts about 20 minutes.  In another segment, Rina talks to the crowd by herself for about 10 minutes while the rest of the band does a wardrobe change to get ready for SCANDAL Nanka Buttobase, in which they dance the full choreography from the video.  (They were dancers before they were a band, and they obviously still have fun doing choreography.)  It's all included.  While it may be a little hard to follow if you don't understand the language, the band's personalities definitely come through.

The end of the show picks the pace back up to whip the crowd back into frenzy mode, with the encores intending to bring back some of the feeling of their early ""live house"" shows.  Their final encores are Space Ranger, Kagerou and Doll, the first three songs they ever released.  To play them, they move to a small island in the middle of the arena that's approximately the same size as their early stages.  Honestly, in the arena itself this didn't translate too well as Budokan is fairly large and it looked artificially constricted to watch them play on this tiny island.  But it comes through better on the disc, where the camera can get in closer.

The picture quality of the Blu-Ray disc is amazing, and the sound is just as I remember it - it's very well mixed, and really punches you in the gut when you hear those perfect harmonies in songs like ""Burn"" or ""Scandal Baby"" (another highlight of the show, and the last song before the encores).  If I have any criticism at all, it's that there are absolutely no extras - previous live Scandal discs have all had behind-the-scenes footage, and it would have been fun to see that here.  But still, this was a long show, and seeing all the MC segments uncut is a rare treat.

I really just can't recommend this disc enough.  If I were going to recommend one Scandal release of any kind - album or video - it would be this one.  It's like a legitimate greatest hits release, with all the songs played better than they ever have been before... including on the albums themselves.",1350345600,5,5912,4.65606936416185
