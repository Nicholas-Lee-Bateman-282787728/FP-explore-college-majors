8235799,3,B000ZKQOMI,"Rana's Wedding moves at an excruciatingly slow pace, telling the story of a girl who chose to stay in Palestine and marry the man she loves. I guess the point was to show that love and happiness can be victorious over death and war. True the message is sweet but the movie/acting is too cold and slow telling a story that is over told about Palestinians and Israelis.
I think that there are other smart and subjective movies that explore this topic much more richly.",1278892800,2,466,4.4941176470588236
8235800,4,B000ZKQOMI,"Hany Abu-Assad has proven himself with this film, 'Ford Transit', and 'Paradise Now', to be one
of the most interesting and astute chroniclers of the Palestinian experience in Jerusalem.
The plot is simple: A young Palestinian woman must decide whether to defy tradition and
marry her boyfriend that day, or leave forever with her father, and enter an arranged marriage
in another land.

The film sometimes meanders, but has some very powerful sequences, giving a strong sense of
the realities of life under occupation, and some sweetly human comic moments showing the
universality of humanity in all cultures.  Very good lead performances all around.",1273104000,,651,5.25
8235801,1,B000ZKQOMI,"The romantic ""plot"" was simply a thin veil for the anti-Israeli propaganda. Showing how roadblocks affect the daily life of Palestinians, I understand. Portraying the Israelis as cruel oppressors and only as such, without the context of history, the answer of what came first- palestinian violence or Israeli oppression- is a gross misrepresentation of reality. There is no doubt that the position of the Palestinian people today is unacceptable- but a change will only come about if the people and their leaders actually want peace. Hamas, the Palestinian political organization that won the majority vote,declares in their charter: ""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it."" and ""There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors."" A solution is available if only they would agree to settle for less than the obliteration of Israel.",1264032000,3,1029,5.3580246913580245
8235802,3,B000ZKQOMI,"This is a fairly typical Palestinian movie that explores the issues of barriers that keep people apart and that keep people from living a ""normal"" life. In this case, Rana, young Palestinian woman finds herself facing an arranged marriage in Egypt because she has not chosen an acceptable man from a list her father has given her. Her father has told her that if she isn't married by 4:00 he will take her to Egypt. The movie covers her day as she tries to avoid this situation. Her strategy is to find her boyfriend and convince him to get married. At first she cannot find him and then there are a number of obstacles to overcome and swings in emotion. Most people will probably enjoy this movie because it shows the main characters moving around the streets of Jerusalem so you get to see a number of scenes you might not normally see in the news. It also shows some of the little struggles Palestinians go through. When all is said and done the ending is fairly happy but the message is sort of political, even though part of the conflict comes from social expectations.

The movie has sort of a sad and depressed tone most of the time and kind of an odd brown-yellowish tint which sort of adds to the feeling of exasperation. This is an interesting film, if not an uplifting one. The main character has appeared in another well-known film as a bride (The Syrian Bride) so it seems a little odd to see her in somewhat of a similar role here, but the movie is worth checking out.",1258243200,4,1482,4.428571428571429
8235803,5,B000ZKQOMI,"PREPARING FOR A wedding is a hectic ordeal anywhere in the world. In the film ""Rana's Wedding,"" however, the bride's situation is even more complicated than most. She awakes from her bed in East Jerusalem with an ultimatum from her father to either marry one of the up-and-coming eligible bachelors who have asked for her hand from a list he has given her, or accompanying him to Egypt--and he wants her decision by four that afternoon. But Rana has other ideas. She sets out to find her true love, Khalil, a struggling theater company director in near-by Ramallah, persuade him to propose, find the registrar, have her father accept her beloved and then marry--all by the 4 p.m. deadline. Because her life is constrained at every turn by the Israeli military occupation, Rana's task is a journey of epic proportion.
Palestinian novelist Liana Badr wrote the screenplay, along with Ihab Lamey, based on her own trials and tribulations in order to marry the Palestinian politician Yasser Abd Rabbih. The film's Palestinian director, Hany Abu-Assad, whose later ""Paradise Now"" was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign film, carefully shows us the daily life of those living under occupation. As they watch a Palestinian home being demolished by an Israeli bulldozer, Rana tells a friend, ""They are destroying homes as I am trying to build one.""
Through it all Rana (played with quiet resolve by Palestinian Clara Khoury) is determined to succeed. Even though at times she is disappointed and despairing, Rana presses on--not unlike the people of Palestine.",1215648000,13,1565,5.046332046332046
8235804,5,B000ZKQOMI,"When the movie first started I thought it would be another young lady trying to run away from home to marry her no good lover. However, the plot was slightly different and very touching. I won't say too much about it but it feels like you're going through the same emotions as Rana* (Clara Khoury). Really great film, it capture todays events but doesn't lose sight of what the film is REALLY about.",1211328000,3,399,4.47945205479452
8235805,5,B000ZKQOMI,"This jewel of film is about planning a whirlwind wedding amid the realities of the life for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Though the political issues are ever present, it does an excellent job of keeping focused on the story.  I felt as if I were seeing Rana's experiences on her wedding day, through her eyes.",1207353600,3,319,4.8
