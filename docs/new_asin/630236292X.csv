455857,1,630236292X,"This movie adaptation is awful.  If you are familiar with the book you will need some antacid after seeing what they've done with the movie.  Instead of a potato farm in crisis they change it to a cattle ranch.  Instead of Grandpa's illness due to money worries they call it a stroke.  Instead of a cranky old woman doctor they make her young and pretty.  They add school chums and a pretty little girl love interest.  They even change the poor dog's name.  Little willy is portrayed as a whiny brat. Oh, No! the people who made this movie had no respect for the beauty of the simple book.  Don't waste your money on this hideously expensive and poorly done adaptation.",1108080000,21,669,4.471074380165289
455858,4,630236292X,"Although some major items were changed in the script from the book, my fourth graders loved seeing this movie as a culminating activity.  Makes for a great comparison from book to movie.  A tear jerker as well.",1046822400,3,210,4.648648648648648
455859,4,630236292X,"My students watched this movie recently, after having read the book as a class assignment.  In many ways, the movie brought the story to life.  You should be made aware of the fact that there are many storyline differences between the text and video.  In the book, for example, little Willy lives on a potato farm and is trying to win the National Dogsled Race to pay the government for back taxes that are due on Grandfather's property.  In the movie, he lives on a large farm and grows wheat crops.  He is trying to win the race so that he and Grandfather have the money to get by during Grandfather's illness.  In the book, Grandfather is described by Doc Smith as being ""As healthy as an Ox.""  In the movie, he is bedridden because he suffered a stroke!  There are also many other new character and plot differences to the story that don't fit in with author John Reynold Gardiner's original script.  We watched the movie as a lesson on how movies often differ from the novel.  One of my students found 85 changes (some very subtle) between the book and the movie.  Still, it was fun to watch, and I believe the children got a lot out of watching the movie!  I would recommend the film, but be prepared to have a discussion on the differences that can occur when a novel is made into a movie.",1034208000,53,1296,4.376569037656904
455870,1,630236292X,"The VHS tape does not work. My class read the novel & we were unable to watch the movie because it was impossible to see through the scrambled lines across the entire screen. I did try it with a different TV & VHS player & it still didn't work.

Can I get a refund or an exchange?",1391558400,,280,3.912280701754386
455871,3,630236292X,"I read this story to my 4th graders every year and then show them the movie.  The kids seem to like the book more, the movie does tend to move slow in places and the kid actor isn't all that.  Reading the book and then watching the movie is a good lesson on similar/contrast because there are a lot between the book/movie.",1387324800,3,322,4.17741935483871
455872,1,630236292X,"VHS didn't work and disappointed the entire 4th grade.  We have read the book for about three weeks, and I told them how great it was.  I threw it away because I was so disappointed.",1386374400,,182,4.171428571428572
455873,5,630236292X,"I let my students watch this after we read the book together in class. We enjoyed comparing the book to the movie. As a reading teacher, I think the book is always better, but the book has a week resolution. The movie leaves you with a sense of satisfaction at the end.",1371600000,,269,4.1923076923076925
455874,3,630236292X,"Considering it was a VHS tape, I guess I should expect it to be a little shaky and not clear, but service was timely and excellent.",1361664000,,131,4.076923076923077
455875,5,630236292X,"After my class read the book ""Stone Fox"" we watched this video to compare the two.  It was a great way for kids to compare because there are several differences.",1322524800,,161,4.366666666666666
455876,5,630236292X,"Stone Fox is a great movie. I used it in the classroom when I taught 3rd grade. I read the book, first, and then we watched the movie to compare. The book is extremely well written also. The end of each chapter is a cliff hanger.",1313452800,,229,4.0
455877,5,630236292X,"My fifth grade class read the book Stone Fox. We also had several activities that we
completed to reinforce a wide variety of language and reading skills at the reading level of the novel.  As a culminating activity we watched the VHS movie Stone Fox.  After the movie the students analyzed the similarities and differences between an original text and its dramatic adaptation.  The students loved the novel as well as the movie!",1297641600,,429,4.8493150684931505
455878,5,630236292X,"I've seen this movie at least a half dozen times and love it every time. I never read the book, so I can't make a comparison but in the movie, I love the evolvution of the character of Willie throughout the story.

Besides being a heartwarming animal flick, it is a wonderful story about community.",1207440000,,298,4.418181818181818
7824788,5,630236292X,"This is a show I've only seen on tv, so I made a recording of it but it then had to be transferred from a VHS to a DVD a few years later and the transfer didn't go very well.  It hasn't been on tv in 2 decades.  It's a wonderful story for kids so why doesn't some tv station show this??

Does anyone know where I could get a DVD version of this wonderful movie?  I would really love for all 7 of my grandkids to see this show AND maybe eventually read the book (when they can all read!). Any assistance to finding a DVD version would be appreciated.",1513728000,,549,3.918918918918919

7824790,5,630236292X,"Great video to show the class after reading the book, if only for the great discussion about how different movie versions of books can be. It's a made-for-TV movie and feels that way. The class was split on what they liked better, the book or the movie.",1456617600,,253,4.404255319148936
7824791,5,630236292X,It was great! my grandson and his class were reading the book so I got them the movie,1455408000,,85,3.7777777777777777
7824792,1,630236292X,"I bought this to show my students after reading the book in class. It was simply awful. In addition to the sluggish pace, the story was changed in minor ways - minor, but enough to be incredibly annoying. For example, the name and the gender of the dog was changed, as well as the type of farm Little Willy lived on.  More importantly, Little Willy had the help of friends in the movie version, whereas in the book, he made much more personal and selfless sacrifices to save the farm.  On the plus side, it illustrated my point that sometimes the book is actually much better than the movie.",1451347200,,591,4.412844036697248
7824793,2,630236292X,"It was a VHS tape as expected, but it was sold as being in good condition.  The plastic casing was cracked.  I needed the tape for a classroom lesson, and wouldn't have had time to return it and replace it.  I repaired it myself with a little tape.  :-/",1437177600,,253,4.1020408163265305
