1385016,5,B00005094P,"man let me just say this, that person who said that this series is boring is not right at all. I own all the dvd's and I love it. It's my favorite anime. It's got a great plot and intrigue. At some times the subtext is a little unclear, so you might need to watch it again, but what true anime fan doesn't watch a movie until the dvd is smoking from spinning so much in the player (an obvious exaggeration). I had to explain alot to my girlfriend as she watched it with me. I had heard that this was based on a game for the playstation console, I really wish I could find that game. The opening song is good at first ""This song is okay."" then by the time you make it to episode 3 you're singing along. I like it so much that I went and bought the cd by Boa (the band who does ""Duvet"" the opening song) it is a great cd.",996451200,4,819,3.880952380952381
1385017,2,B00005094P,"I never watched it all the way through. But what I saw of it wasn't that intresting. The first time my friend put in the dvd I fell asleep then, the next time he put it in it was quickly turned off and replaced by another anime. There should be a warning on the package that says ""If your intent is to stay awake, do anything but drewl, and/or be boored DO NOT WATCH.""",992995200,2,368,3.9864864864864864
1385018,5,B00005094P,"Buying this box set was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It not only includes the 4 DVDs of the whole series, but you get a lunch box and a limited edition CD of Boa, the group that sings the theme song to the series. It has four songs on it and the theme song really gets stuck in your head. I did, unfortunatley, bought mine for $119.99 at a mall so I didn't really save anything:
lunch box................. $ 10
limited edition CD.... $ 10
4 DVDs................... $100
Watching the entire series of Lain while eating out of your cool new lunch box and listening to the theme song over and over..... priceless.
(Sorry! Was given the opportunity and had to do it.) Besides, I would never eat out of the lunchbox, it is too nice and in great condition. I use it to store the Lain series inside if it.
I have to say this is a really good series. I think it's rated for viewers 16 and up. I would have to say that is a suitable. There is nothing too bad in it to make it unsuitable for younger teens except for the fact that people commit suicide, the regular pervertedness and love you'll find on most anime, and that there is realastic blood in it, and that people go insane and crazy. But some of the concepts and things they talk about little kids would not understand and would not enjoy it. It took me a little while to understand it, and my friend watched part of it with me and I had to attempt to explain a few parts of it to her. This anime is deep and has some philosphical and psychological aspects to it. Plus religion is tied into it, I know the obvious ways religion it tied into it but I can't figure out or see the deeper picture.
It is sort of like the Matrix. Two different worlds that only a few people know about and ""The One"" is the chosen one to be able to cross between the two worlds freely. Like Neo, Lain knows and can do what normal people can not. Like in the Matrix, the general public are just puppets to be used and that all your family is not really your family but rather just put there by a computer. Only the few exceptional people are hackers that work together, but get hunted down by the officials like in the Matrix. And like Neo, both sides try to Lain to their advantage.
Anyway, it was a great series and I watched the entire series all in one sitting. It's a big change from watching Sailor Moon and Card Captors. As you can see, I'm not the intelligent, articulate, kind of person. I really don't even act my age and everyone thinks I am 4 years younger than I am, but I really enjoyed it and it made me really think. the beginning was a little slow, but the ending was so unexpected and it just makes you cry.",992908800,14,2666,4.1686046511627906

1385022,4,B00005094P,"Serial Experiments Lain is a show which leaves most people with a distinct impression of 'huh?'. It is the story of a girl named Lain, who is rather socially inept.
In the first episode, a classmate of Lain's jumps off of a building to her death. Afterwards, people start receiving E-mails from this girl. And that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the 'weirdness' of Lain.
As the series progresses, so does Lain. Because of the dead girl's E-mail, she gets a little interested in computers. She learns more and more of the Wired, which is like our Internet. From the individuals on the Wired, and from her own experiences there, she slowly learns the truth about the Wired, and the world.
Lain is a nicely slow, somewhat pretentious anime. It questions what we know as the real world, using real-seeming characters.
In some ways, the series has an 'X-files' (the multi-part episodes) feel to it. You never quite know what's going on, who's who, and just when the pieces are about to come together, the storyline takes another twist.
A good look into the psyche of the Internet, Internet users, and the world.

1385023,5,B00005094P,"when i first got this i opened the package and looked inside... i found something horrible. the packaging was intact but the product was in a condition that can only be described as factory destruction... of the collectors box. the quality of the collectors box aside the only other damage i found was a small crack in one of the jewel cases (like is that a big deal?) and the gratuitous art book being trimmed ever so slightly off center or the binding being glued on wrong... all stuff i would blame on QC that does not affect my personal value of the set itself.

so why rate it 5 stars if QC is lacking? because you get a lot more than you pay for at any price under like 150-200. that gratuitous art book i mentioned, yeah i wish EVERY limited edition animated movie or TV series would come with it. instead of some of the other filler swag that Funi and others are putting in them. but i have to say Funi especially tends charge a lot less that what they should when it comes to some of their limited editions. this one is no exception not only do you get that gratuitous art book that is filled with character designs and set designs, you get a commentary with Hiroshi Saito and one of Lain's producers Yasuyuki Ueda talking about the various things they did to Restore Lain, along with various promotional art form Yoshitoshi ABe, and some emails from Hiroshi Saito (to Yasuyuki Ueda) again detailing the progress of Restoring Lain.

outside of the collectibles mentioned above (the art book i would say is undersold at $100) you get the beautifully restored version of Lain on Blu Ray and DVD with the original Pioneer Dub and the Original Japanese audio (both of which probably having been remastered).

the story is as relevant today as it was in the 90's, and like Akira you can take a great many things out of it every time you see it. this will stand the test of time (if the package does not degrade to nothingness before eternity is over) and is one of the ESSENTIAL classic shows if you can't get this version there are others out theres including the Japanese Restore that probably has an even more gratuitous value.",1409270400,,2134,4.466666666666667

1385026,5,B00005094P,"It seems with every passing day, we inch a bit closer to the Internet of Things, in which everything from small appliances to large factories will be connected to--and controllable over--the Internet.  Consider for a moment that ten years ago Facebook was just getting going and the smartphone was limited, outside of Japan, to the BlackBerry and a handful of Windows Mobile devices that no one particularly liked.

Six years earlier, the Internet was a rough, largely uncharted territory only recently gone mainstream.  Sure, it was exciting to be able to access porn whenever we wanted, and playing chess via email with people in South Africa was kinda neat, but no one outside of a very specialized group could foresee how ubiquitous the Internet would one day become.  In 1998, to most of the world, the Internet was just a big computer network.

Enter Serial Experiments Lain.

First broadcast in Japan over the summer of 1998 and premiering nine months before The Matrix hit American theaters, Lain tells the story of Lain Iwakura, a painfully introverted adolescent girl living in Japan.  At the start of the series, Chisa, a girl from Lain's school, commits suicide by jumping from the top of a building.  Shortly thereafter, Lain and her schoolmates begin receiving emails from Chisa stating that everyone needs to come to the Wired as soon as possible because there is a god in the Wired.  The Wired is a global information network analogous to the Internet but connected to virtually everything in the world.  In order to continue communicating with her dead friend, Lain asks her father to buy her a new computer, called a Navi in the show, presumably a shortening of Navigator, and from there, any summary of the show's plot is going to fail.  There is simply too much going on, too many characters with too many motivations, too many red herrings, and too many tonal shifts to keep track of.

Several years ago, I taught Lain as a literature unit in one of my classes.  We viewed each episode, discussed the characters and the themes, the complexity of the narrative, in short we READ the series instead of simply viewing it, which I maintain is the best way of approaching Lain.  It may not have been my most successful teaching moment, but I still have students now who come to me and talk about it.  This is the kind of series that really does stay with its audience, and repeat viewings yield fresh revelations.  That is, once the audience gets past one small but significant fact:

Lain.  Is.  Weird.

We can start with the odd time setting of the series, which is announced at the beginning of most episodes as ""Present day, present time,"" followed by a maniacal laugh and bursts of static.  It's an unsettling announcement because, as we move through narrative, we're confronted with a world that resembles our own in many ways but not technologically, though it can be argued that Lain more closely resembles the technological world of 2014 than it did the technological world of 1998.  In that sense, though, the opening only becomes unsettling in how prescient the series would turn to be.  Regardless, the opening remains unsettling because of a basic perceptual conflict:  the ""Present day, present time"" setting is not the ""now"" of the audience, but rather the ""now"" of the series.  In essence, the show announces that it is set when it is set.

Adding to the weirdness is the fact that episodes are not called episodes or chapters.  They are called Layers, as in a layer that must be peeled away in order to get to the heart of the matter, to make sense of the series as a whole.

And then there are the characters themselves.  Lain is an adolescent girl who can barely speak to her own family, let alone her friends.  Lain's mother could not be more disengaged from her two daughters.  Lain's sister literally disappears before Lain's eyes at the end of the fifth layer only to be replaced by what might charitably be considered a shell of a human being.  And Lain's father, who shows the most emotion of anyone in her immediate family, appears to genuinely love his daughter even as he is cut off, sometimes quite literally, from her.  One of my favorite shots of the first episode involves Lain asking her father for a new Navi.  She walks into his study and is almost completely blocked from him by a kind of wall of computers and monitors.  Her father talks to her but never really holds a dialogue with her, instead becoming excited over something he finds on the Wired while Lain is talking.

And that is one of the major themes of the series:  people being disconnected from one another.  The Wired as a result becomes an intricate metaphor for human interaction:  people log on and ""connect"" with other people, but those connections are fleeting and not real in any substantive sense.  Think of it as Facebook.  You have 5000 friends on Facebook, but how many of those friendship are really real?  How many of them are tangibly real?

This brings up another one of the major concerns of Lain:  the question of reality.  What is reality?  What does it mean to be real?  Where is the line drawn between the real and the unreal?  And by extension, is it possible for the unreal to become real?

Going back to our Facebook example, many friendships may not be real in literal, tangible sense, but they are real insofar as they are an exchange of interests and communication and intimacies.  They may not be as substantive as a flesh-and-blood friendship, but they are still real in some sense.  Likewise, the Wired of the series is several times dismissed by characters as nothing more than a fancy way of transporting information, that it cannot be confused with the real world.  However, to an introvert like Lain, the Wired represents a means of overcoming her shyness and allowing her truer, fuller self to emerge and interact freely with other people.  In essence, Lain chooses a reality in which she have more control.  Is it an illusion?  Possibly, but it is still her reality.

Of course, we still have yet to discuss how the alien fits into all of this.  I don't really have any answer to that.

And how the series ultimately plays out, how it evolves from a scared little girl playing on the Internet to its endgame, is all the more interesting for the way it effectively reframes the narrative.  The final four layers can be thought of the story of a god who comes to Earth, forgets it is a god, experiences profound and disturbing loneliness, and inadvertently begins to destroy one reality by grafting a second reality on top of it.  It that seems a bit heady to you, you're not alone.  I've seen the complete series a dozen times and when I get to those last episodes, I still struggle with making them work.

And that might be the series' greatest failing.  It is almost too complex for its own good.  Too many questions are left not only unanswered but unanswerable.  What exactly happens to Mika when she sees herself at the end of Layer 5?  Who are the Men in Black and why are they looking to stop the Knights of the Eastern Calculus?  What power does Masami Eri actually wield in the Wired?  And in the end, who is the final, top-of-the-heap God?

Lain is a series that comes dangerously close to falling apart repeatedly throughout its run and yet manages to pull it all together into a more or less tight narrative by the end.  What's more, while computers have been used a number of times as a metaphor for isolation and distance between human beings, I'm not sure it has ever been as effective as it is here, and the effectiveness has only grown in the intervening years due to our growing technological dependence.

The ending of the series deserves special note for how downbeat it is.  Lain does find purpose and peace at the end of the series, but she is arguably even more isolated than she is at the beginning.  Conventional interpretation seems to agree that the ending is as upbeat as is possible given the rest of the story, but I still find it very downbeat, very sad.

I highly recommend Serial Experiments Lain.  I do advise you to watch it straight through, if possible, and be prepared to do a bit of research on the various names mentioned throughout the series, as that will help to explain some of the gaps.",1405036800,5,8281,4.644429160935351

I love animations like these, i'v not found many animations that gets you thinking as much as Lain did. In an era where anime series are tilting towards brain-dead clich concepts, Lain saves me out of the blue.
It is such a typical Japanese styled animation and i do have problems with some bits here and there, but I actually prefer it that way since the re-watch value is so great.
Lain provokes me to question our living ideals and it constantly plays with different existential questions.
I don't usually get that emotionally involved in movies, but Lain really got me at times. To some people this might even be a depressing and frustrating series to watch, there is no mercy when it comes to tragedy in Lain, not in quantity but in effect and in a harshness that immediately throws you out of your comfort zone.

While I may personally love the series and rate it as one of the best animes of all time, it is not for everyone, let alone your average anime fan. Allow me to explain. Serial Experiments Lain is not full of action, it does not have a robust list of deep and interesting characters, it uses a very basic art style, it is pretty old, and it has a very dark and sad tone the entire time. Lain is a story about just one girl, and her journey into what initially appears to be insanity, that starts with a dead girl communicating to her through the internet.

The sales for the Lain series took a mindboggling upward swing in sales as the series aired on Tech TV's late night release. Lain has since become a cult classic among anime enthusiasts. Its crazy dialogue, stark visuals, disturbing imagery, thought-provoking themes, and often confusing plot lines engages its audience to the limits. The references and the philosophical ideas are there that only the most experienced conspiracy conjurer could grasp. Yet, it finishes up with an ending that even a general audience will be satisfied with.
Lain's sad, soulful stare is burned into the back of my mind. This is one of those unforgettable series.

Geneon went under, but thankfully Funimation picked this back up from the back bin of history for an amazing release quality. The upscale on the BluRays is just so incredible for a series so old.

My biggest criticism is if you're familiar with the ideology at all, the symbols can be TOO overt.  The main symbol/metaphore is the internet.  The main character gets wrapped up in being online and eventually discovers that everything she thought was real is all a lie.  This ties in to certain eastern philosophies that believe the spiritual (in this case the internet) is truely real while matter (her family, friends, etc.) is all illusion.  But as I mentioned earlier, if you are familiar with this concept at all it's so obvious it smacks you in the face and takes a bit of the joy of the hunt out of realizing it.

The fury of technological reality and the unreality of everyday reality can seem a bit trite at times, but at no point in Serial Experiments Lain did i feel a suspension of disbelief. The pacing is slow and beautiful, and the mannerisms of the characters reinforce the unnerving nature of the topic without becoming parodies of themselves.

I was very happy with this purchase and it made a wonderful addition to my collection. It shows a very real fear in peoples lives when it comes to the internet and acceptance in society. Can we really control peoples prospective mirrored onto our self about our self?. Very well done. Also the main character is one of the best personalities I have seen in a while.

Serial Experiments Lain is one of the greatest and weirdest animes of all time. It piles on layers (pun intended; it calls each episode a ""layer"") of hard science and surreal imagery to create a compelling story you'll be thinking about for the rest of your life. It's been close to a decade since I first watched this series and I'm still trying to figure it out.

It permanently shattered my view of the world.  I watched the thirteen episodes and I was different.

The show is slow, immensely complex, and certainly not for everyone, but if you can keep up, if you can hold on tightly enough to let it show you what it's got, I guarantee you'll never look at a piece of technology the same way again.

On one hand, your heart goes out to the girl Lain, living in a faux family and being the odd girl out at school.  But as the series (and Lain) evolve, you realize that nothing is quite as it seems.  The ending is surprising in that it wraps things up very nicely - something that seemed like it would be impossible to do.

While it was thought-provoking, I found myself confused a lot and very uncomfortable the entire time. Really it creeped me out and I consider Lain to be more horror than anything.

so being that this is an old series, it looks wonderful on bluray! it finally got the treatment it deserves. you get both the bluray and dvd versions of this set. the bluray has about 9 episodes on the first disc and the remaining episodes on disc 2. all the special features from the original dvd release from way back when have been included, but those extras were not upgraded at all to HD, they are the same SD version as you saw them, maybe even just under SD, because i saw the trailer for the CD and it looked like VHS quality, i'm sure its the same quality as my lain dvds from back when.
the box set itself is a hard durable box, it comes with a booklet which is the episode guide, and the artbook which is pretty damn massive and filled with tons and tons of scetches of just about anything lain, from her character drawings to room layouts, its just really in depth and much appreciated. i also love the menu layout for the bluray version, i'm not sure if the dvd is the same but it basically looks like an old windows computer/dos screen. i thought that was pretty awesome. all in all, you'll greatly enjoy this if you were a fan of the show. although the price is mighty high, i feel as though you are getting what your paying for. it may have been cheaper if they didn't add in the dvds, but i guess they didn't want to do two separate releases and just bundled them into this combo deal, which i think is smart.",1358035200,,1513,4.1993127147766325

Serial Experiments Lain has been one of those anime titles I've heard of ever since I got into anime back in July of 2002, but never checked out since from the surface, didn't look all that appealing to me at the time.  I made a gamble when Funimation was reissuing this anime by pre-ordering it on Amazon a few months back, got it on release date, and just finished watching it.  I guess after suffering a few months back from that puke-inducing animated swill known as High School of the Dead, a cerebral anime like this was just what I needed.  As you can see by my rating, I was really glad to have seen this.

Before I kick off the review, I should suggest to potential viewers that before watching it (if you want to see it), that you get yourself a lot of coffee and M&Ms (or whatever caffeinated and sugary food/beverages you like) when you watch Serial Experiments Lain, not because it's boring (quite the opposite), but because this is an anime that will give your brain a good workout.

STORY

Serial Experiments Lain is about a young girl named Lain Iwakura, who at first appears to be a shy, lukewarm junior high school student.  After receiving a Navi (a computer connected to the Wired, the anime's version of the internet) from her dad, she soon finds herself engrossed in the Wired and embarks on a journey where the virtual world and reality are blurred.  In this journey, many mind-bending things will happen and her personality will alter in so many ways.  Along the way, she finds out of a power struggle between a mysterious group of hackers known as the Knights of Eastern Calculus and the Tachibana corporation.

CHARACTERS

I though the way the characters were handled in this anime was well done.  The focus is mostly on Lain, and at first, she seems like a shy girl devoid of any personality.  However, as her immersion in the Wired gets deeper, many bolder personalities of Lain are embodied.  I was pleased with how Lain's school friends (Alice, Julie, and Reika) were handled, since they felt like teenage girls, but at the same time, this anime didn't bombard you with a bunch of sappy teenage school drama coming from these girls' mouths, which would have been a huge distraction from the central parts of the story.

Other characters, like Lain's family, have believable, well-established personalities that get altered when the real world and the Wired are altered with, and these changes work out really well in the context of the story.

THEMES

Since Serial Experiments Lain is an anime that's heavily entrenched in philosophy and the rapid evolution of computer and electronic networking technology.

I'll be honest here and say that so many things have happened in this anime, that I'll need to watch it again at least once to get a full grasp of this, but I was able to comprehend this well enough to know what happened and what some things mean.

This anime's most prominent theme is that it's almost like a warning to people about over-reliance on computerized electronic communications.  I thought this type of ""warning"" was tastefully-done since it's not shoved in your face and isn't sanctimonious about it.  I guess you could say the core message with this theme is that over-reliance on the Wired (or internet) will diminish one's humanity.  I think it's crazy that this was made in 1998 yet the themes of technology are still relevant today.

Religion is another theme tackled in this anime, and without spoiling anything, some of the discussion between Lain and Eiri (who calls himself ""God"") will make ponderous folks happy.

There was also real history about the first computers and electronic networks that would tie into the foundation for the Wired, and I thought this combination was ace since these meshed perfectly and shows it has some proper learning of important history.

HORROR ELEMENTS

While not being an outright horror anime, there are some horror elements used in it to illustrate the psychological deterioration Lain and others go through in this anime.  One of the creepiest was on Layer 09:  Protocol, where an alien in a red and green sweater peaks into Lain's room and creeps her out.

Another horror scene that creeped me out a lot was when Mika (Lain's older sister) starts hallucinating in a fast food joint, and when in the bathroom, is forced into seeing ""Fulfill your destiny!"" scribed on the stall door.

What I find funny about the scant horror scenes in it is that there's horrible anime like Elfen Lied that constantly bombard you with gore, trying to pass it off as scary, and while the horror scenes in Serial Experiments Lain had very little to no blood in them, were far more unnerving than anything the likes of Elfen Lied, Gantz, or High School of the Dead could throw at you.

APPEARANCE

The animation and artwork for this is stunning.  With this being an anime from the late 90's, this was one of the last pieces of anime that would have had traditional cel animation in it, and incorporated a lot of fusion with CGI and real photographs and film passed through various filters.  The combination of these visual elements help reinforce the strong themes of technological takeover and of the overall cerebral nature of the show.

While the looks of the computers and other electronics look a little dated by today's world of thin supercomputers and smartphones, they almost seem like the foundation of the technology we take for granted.  Lain's Navi can view video from the Wired without excessive buffer times and even has voice recognition for the password and cellphones have email capacity, which I thought was pretty visionary for its time.  Also, Lain's Navi is hooked to a series of other computers and cooling machines to make it look like a menacing entity taking over Lain's life.

I have to give props to Yoshitoshi ABe's (yes, the ""b"" in his last name is capitalized) character designs since they largely lean more towards ""realistic"" human looks while still have a strong ""anime"" air to them.

SOUNDTRACK

The soundtrack here is a little of a mixed bag, but thankfully leans more towards the good side.  I found the intro and outro music to be pretty unremarkable, but the background music in the episodes is quite good.  There's heavy use of ambient electronic music and even some more aggressive tones in this niche, that perfectly match the setting of this anime.  There's some other styles of music in some episodes, such as in the last Layer, that featured a good deal of instrumental psychedelic rock pretty reminiscent to Jimi Hendrix.

TONAL CONSISTENCY

One of the things that really made me happy about Serial Experiments Lain is that the creators took this show really seriously and didn't try to inject scenes of redundant humor with exaggerated, goofy faces and chibi deformations.  There's also no terminally-unfunny moments revolving around the female body trying to be funny.  The totally serious, mature presentation of this anime made it extremely enjoyable.

MATURE CONTENT

While I'd recommend this anime to adults for its cognitive content, the visual content is essentially suitable to anyone 14 or older.  The most ""extreme"" bits in this anime was when there is a shootout at the Cyberia nightclub, with a little bit of blood flowing on the floor, and some tastefully-done nudity in another where Lain is seen naked in the sky, but no private areas were illustrated on her.

FINAL WORD

This was one of the best and most rewarding anime titles I've seen in at least three years, and would even rank it as one of the best anime titles you can find.  If you're in the market for an anime that's totally serious in execution and will really get your brain juices flowing, then Serial Experiments Lain is essential to your collection.",1357862400,4,7940,4.785766691122524
1385066,4,B00005094P,"Lain is not your average school girl. She's detached, boring, and not very into technology. All that changes when a classmate of hers kills herself. Lain and her friends receive postmortem e-mails from her saying that she has merely left her body and now lives within the ""Wired"". The Wired is an evolved form of the internet. Lain is intrigued by this event and begins to explore The Wired.

When she gets involved with The Wired, Lain discovers that it is more than just a network of electrical signals. It is more like a living thing. A living thing with a will. Is it god? Is it an alternate Universe? Who the hell knows? I think it may be all of those. Lain discovers the truth behind her existence, the existence of the Wired, and their relationship to the real world.

This anime all all kinds of weird. It's older, so the animation is kinda odd. It's from the creator of Haibane Renmei; and it's obvious from the character designs. I had to try very hard to get through the first 5 episodes. It bored me to death and made me angry. Once things began to unfold, I started to appreciate it. This is one of those artsy/experimental shows. It's totally philosophical ans psychological. There is not much action or drama. It moves painfully slow. Most of the characters are very one dimensional and have no personality. Lain and here family are especially boring people.

The psychological elements of this story are the main focus. The characters teeter back and forth on the frayed edges of sanity. What is real? What is not? What is the truth? These things drive the characters to the edge. It takes a toll on your brain as you watch the characters explore their world. The animation and soundtrack also gnaw at your patience. There is a lot of static and ""white noise"" going through the speakers.

I respect this series for it's depth and creativity, but I just don't like it. The story is deep and thought provoking, the animation is unique, but it's a major chore to watch. If I rated it according to how much enjoyment I got out of it; I would give it 2 stars. That isn't a fair rating though. If I'm trying to be objective, I'll give it 4 stars. It is a long shot from 5 stars, but it is a great piece of art and storytelling. There is nothing to get attached to in this series, so it's hard to fall in love with it. If you remember the ending of the Evangelion TV series; where the characters pretty much get a psyche evaluation, you can get a relative idea of what this anime is like. It's like watching the final Evangelion episode for 5 hours. I can't recommend buying this anime without watching it first. If you're interested in it, most definitely watch it online or rent it first. I bought it before I saw it, based on all the 5 star reviews. It pisses me off that everyone raved about something that was so subjective. I really wish I had watched it before buying. I can't stress it enough: WATCH BEFORE YOU BUY. YOU MAY LOVE IT, YOU MAY HATE IT.

Review of the product:

This is an excellent release(5 stars). It comes with both Blu-ray and DVD versions in separate cases. The box is very sturdy and has beautiful artwork. There is a small booklet inside with commentary for each episode. There is also a really big art book inside. Personally, I think the art book is kind of a waste of space and unnecessary, but if you're paying out the ass for something like this, you may as well get something extra. Overall, this special edition is probably only gonna interest major fans of the series. It's a great box set.",1357430400,,3536,4.440677966101695
1385067,5,B00005094P,"When I bought this, I expected it to be pretty basic given the price.

While perhaps a bit too surreal and cereberal for it's own good it is a very intelligent anime that breaks the mold of ""cute characters doing cute things"" that seems very prominent right now.

This collection is gorgeous, coming with all 12 original episodes and the 13th DVD exclusive episode, all of them remastered and looking clean and crisp. The only visual issue I had with this remastering was the coloring, as colors are far more saturated and clean than they were previously. This makes the show crisp and aesthetically pleasing but the show loses it's gritty, dirty feeling it had in previous releases.

The box also comes with a hard-cover art book and walk through for the series, which is a great collectors piece.

This series is NOT for every one, I'll admit; It's a dense watch and requires several views to completely understand, but as a finished product it is VERY wonderful.",1357171200,,1028,4.862857142857143

1385070,5,B00005094P,"SEL is by far my favorite anime. That should not mean much to you however, because even though it is my favorite, I'm not going to say that it is the best anime ever because it most certainly is not. It's dark, surreal, confusing, and suspenseful. That being said, it is one of the slowest paced anime I have ever watched, and leaves more unanswered questions than any other anime I've seen. That's not necessarily a bad thing though... You see, there is a difference between having plot points unexplained, and leaving plot points open to interpretation. SEL leaves so much open to interpretation, meaning that you can't just sit down and enjoy SEL for what you see, you have to take your time with it and let it all sink in, think about it, and possibly rewatch it once, or twice, or you might be on your third watch like I am. Not because I NEED to but because I WANT to. Each time I watch it I catch something I didn't notice before, or something will just make sense.

Again, this anime is slow, and ends without answering all of your questions. If this is an immediate turn off, then don't watch this anime. You will probably not like it and it will just be a waste of your time.

If all of my talk about it being deep, having rewatch value, and leaving events open to interpretation have you ecstatic, then by all means watch the living hell out of this anime.

Above all, SEL is a rare gem in anime that takes a leap of faith into waters that no other anime dares to enter. I have never watched or read anything like it, and it has changed the way that I believe the world, and it's people work.",1355788800,,1603,4.2838283828382835

1385072,5,B00005094P,"Edit: This review is specifically for the product perma-linked here: http://www.amazon.com/Serial-Experiments-Lain-Complete-Blu-ray/dp/B008YRL5V4/ref=tmm_blu_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=, the Limited Edition set that Funimation released in 2012. Amazon has chosen to merge some other versions of the series into this product listing, but my review covers only the LE Blu-ray/DVD set released in 2012. My apologies for any confusion! (And thanks to Timothy for the tip)

I don't usually do stuff like this, but I had a few friends who were on the fence about grabbing this, and since my copy came (from RightStuf) yesterday, I figured it would be nice to have a review that tells you exactly what you're getting. There are many reviews of Lain around, and I'd recommend giving plenty of them a good look. This review is purely for this release. The series itself is solid (I watched it several years ago with a friend, and have every intention of reviewing it in full after another watch. Or two!), and if you so desire, it can bring about a lot of interesting discussion. It's not for everyone, but it's one of those series' that I think everyone should try at least once.

Serial Experiments Lain was originally released in 1998 by Geneon. It would get a nice quality box set release a few years later, and one more slimpack-esque release a few years later. All of these releases are available on Amazon if you're curious about them. Back at Anime Expo 2010, Funimation announced they had picked the title up (along with some others, of course), and later suggested that this would be the definitive version released in the States. Well, for as skimpy as some Funi releases can be, they were absolutely correct. Anyway, sorry for over pre-facing, onwards!

So everything comes in a nice artbox, it's a perfect size for two blu-ray cases (one for the DVD, one for the blu-ray), and the two books. It looks surprisingly good amidst a small blu-ray collection, and does not at all stand out like some other BR/DVD combo packs. First, let's talk about the books. The first is a 320-page artbook - it's soft cover, and it's worth noting that this book isn't much bigger in height than a blu-ray case, but it's nice and glossy. It's one of those books that just feels high quality. Now if you're used to getting a ton of art books, you might be disappointed here, there's no full-color work, and there isn't much in the way of notes either (or rather, the notes aren't translated). That doesn't really detract from it too much though. Nearly every page is covered in line art, and as you might expect from such an extensive book, it covers many of the locales and characters you'll be seeing throughout the series. It also has pretty extensive character profiles. Overall, I came away pretty impressed. The second book, more of a booklet, is of a similar quality in terms of production. It's a fun and neat little booklet, almost entirely a conversation between Yasuyuki Ueda and Hiroshi Saito. It's pretty interesting, and provides decent explanation of some of the animation stuff they discuss. It's also light-hearted and funny enough to be a decent read even if you're not taking in much of the technical side.

Now to the good part, video quality. So the first thing to point out is that the aspect ratio is still 4:3. 16:9 obviously was not in much use when the series originally aired, there will probably be some unnecessary squabbling about this, but 4:3 was the best option, and it looks perfectly fine. Second, this is a 1998 release, I don't think that can be stated enough times. This is a complete remaster, and the difference between the original release and this release is absolutely stunning. It really speaks to when a series is given proper mastering treatment, versus the quick upscale so many modern series are treated to. (That's not to make too much of a comparison - a modern series with this kind of treatment will obviously be of a higher quality.) Lines are stronger, colors are deeper, small inconsistencies and grain from the original have been ironed out. The blu-ray quality is great, the DVD quality is of course a bit lower. Either one is still miles better than the original.

And finally, extras. The original box set release came with some on-disc concept art, and the same on-disc extras as this release does. Given the quality of the video and the physical extras, there's not too much to complain about here, but, also nothing new.

Final rundown, with this release you get:

-Artbox case, nicely sized
-Blu-Ray Restoration Booklet, a few color images, a conversation about the restore and...e-mails!
-320-page softcover Artbook, full of lineart and some sketches
-2 DVDs (in a blu-ray case)
-2 blu-rays (in a blu-ray case)

1385073,2,B00005094P,"Pros:
 - The show looks somewhat better than the original DVD release.
 - The box looks stylish on a shelf.

Cons:
 - Unskippable advertisements when you load discs. I hope you weren't planning on watching Steins;Gate, because by inserting this disc you get a 2 minute spoiler of the first 13 episodes.
 - The box was coming apart at one seam from the moment I took off the shrink wrap.
 - The disc cases fit snug, and I mean snug in this box. You can turn the box upside down and shake it, and the art books will fall out; then reach in, grab the disc case, and shake it and the box still won't come off.

If the disc had no advertisements I'd give it a 5, and if I could skip them I'd give it at 3. But it's 100% a deal breaker to me: I didn't buy this disc so I could watch a few minutes of steins;gate every time I put it into my player.

When somebody pays over 5 dollars an episode, they expect not to see advertisements beforehand. Nothing shouts ""timeless"" quite like a few minutes of flash-in-the-pan show previews you can't get rid of.

With regards to image quality: The show looks somewhat better, but of course be aware that it's a remaster, not a real improvement. A good 40% of the shots are still hilariously off-model, with most of the rest being stills. The remastering booklet explains it better than me, so I'll share with you a few representative quotes:

SAITO: This has a different sensibility than today's anime, doesn't it? I mean, these days even in still cuts we have the characters blink or something, right? But this doesn't have any of that, so sometimes I'd get nervous and think, ""this this cut really finished?""

...

UEDA: Also, I'd never realized before that this cut was of the housing complex exterior. [Note: Yes this is the director speaking]
SAITO: The film was pitch-black the first time I looked at it, too. When when did gamma correction and converted it to linear gamma we started to be able to see it, so I left it like that with a note to ""please re-darken if desired for artistic reasons.""",1353801600,10,2036,4.38563829787234

1385075,5,B00005094P,"Lain is one of the most carefully built-up story-lines in the genre.  The soundtrack and the visual ambiance drive the show.  By no means is this an action flick,  I would categorize it under ""Horror"",  due to the slow exploitation of of tension. Definately in a class of its own.",1352937600,,280,4.54
1385076,5,B00005094P,"EDIT1 (12.6.13): I feel like a different introduction should be used here.

First, let's get this out of the way: It hit me upon watching this again that Lain exhibits classic symptoms of schizophrenia and very schizoid mannerisms through the beginning. The first couple of episodes show things mostly through Lain's perspective, but the way she perceives her reality is impossibly bizarre. And her perspective is one of overt psychosis--obvious hallucinations of different natures in episodes one and two, feelings and sightings of being watched, being painfully socially inhibited, a seeming inability to show strong emotions even in the face of PTSD-level trauma--it's really all there, both positive and negative symptoms of a developing disorder of thought and perception.

I thought it prudent to point this out, as her developing thought processes are clearly disordered and her perceptions hallucinatory. The series never explains any of these strange hallucinations she has, or her flat affect and odd indifference even when in life-threatening situations.

Others have already touched on the limited ability to make this series ""Blu-ray quality"". It is, indeed, a very old series, and it was never possible to remove the 4:3 native aspect ratio. Additionally, due to the variety of colors used, it was no doubt difficult to clean these up. However, the effort is apparent. If you're well-aware of the very original release ever-so-long-ago, it will be easy to spot that a Blu-ray transition does not magically make the animation or picture quality like a more modern series. Some credit needs to be given, though, that the effort is there. To expect more is just not reasonable.

...Which is probably why they throw in quite a few extras in the box to make the Blu-ray more worthwhile than a very simple resolution upgrade with some touch-ups. You get quite a bit of stuff here, which is already listed, and is good stuff.

And, really, it's worth it for the top menu alone. Easily the most aesthetically creative and just-plain-cool Blu-ray menu for any anime I've come across. Someone had a good idea with that one, and it was executed beautifully.

---

The very first two lines you hear in the first episode define the entire series. Maybe you've even seen it before because of how ridiculously creepy it is. This isn't a spoiler (it's the first two sentences ever spoken by anyone, and comes immediately before the opening credits of almost every episode), but once you hear an unnamed voice say in a disturbed tone, ""Present day...*chuckle*...PRESENT TIME...HAHAHAHA!"" Then the screen immediately cuts to white noise with a faint silhouette of Lain.

Yes, it only takes literally two sentences and about five seconds of white noise on your TV for you to get the flavor of this series.

If you appreciate anime series that are extremely heavy on real-life intellectual and philosophical issues, combined with an incredibly original and unpredictable protagonist, unbelievable twists, heavy but certainly not glorified violence, and a ""feel"" that's unique all on its own and has never been topped, this is your ticket. Nothing really compares or has compared since then, even though it's a relatively old series.

This is one of *those* series that, once an episode is over, you'll have an extreme amount of difficulty not watching ""just one more episode to see what happens"". Once this series creeps into your blood and the story kickstarts hardcore by the end of the first episode, the sheer unpredictability of the events and the character reactions mixed with a unique art style and general creepiness will stay on your mind for a long, long time.

There has *never* been a character like Lain herself. But anything I say about that would be a spoiler. Let's just say that she's a somewhat eccentric girl, and the writers made no effort to turn her into a typical anime female heroine that is actually believable in an intentionally unbelievable world in which she lives.

From Lain's older sister's development as her own character to the identity and purpose of the KNIGHTS hacking group, every episode teases you with something that can, and does, change the entire course of the events.

You may or may not have difficulty understanding the climax of the series, as some people have called it a notorious ""Gainax Ending"", meaning it appears to make absolutely no sense, and you have no clue what just happened upon the final lines spoken. But after I watched and really paid attention, I felt like I had a good grasp of exactly what was going on the whole time. Obviously, I won't spoil it, but let's just say that it does, in fact, make sense, if you've been paying attention to the messages throughout the series and understand every character's motivation and the inevitable conclusion it all leads to. (I wrote about the ending on TV Tropes, so if you need help understanding it, that may help. But, hey, I'll field questions after you're done with it.)

Very, very highly recommended. Lain's development alone is enough of a hook to keep the series going, but there's so much more to explore as the story blossoms outward.",1352764800,,5149,4.9790454016298025
1385077,5,B00005094P,"Because I think you laced my pancakes with acid.  This series is trippy, weird, downright disturbing at times, and as of two episodes in*, a total mind-screw.  So far, I love it!

1385078,5,B00005094P,"It's tempting to call this series dark; but the sun can be so overwhelming, it bleaches the sky, the faces, the sidewalks and buildings.  Even the shadows are illuminated with deep red splotches.  These and other visuals reinforce the theme of this series.  So much so, you may feel you are watching an art film.  But what is that theme?  It could be religious allegory, madness, or the alienation that the internet creates. The line gets blurred, and the sun doesn't shed light on it.  On the bright side, the ambiguity leaves room for fresh interpretations; it will never really be dated.

The central character, a teen named Lain, starts with almost no personality.  Her family has even less.  After the suicide of a schoolmate, and a text message from the grave, Lain begins an exploration of the wired, and as the series gets deeper, so does her personality.  While her character becomes more relatable, she also seems to suffer amnesia, visions, split personality and paranoia.  Or perhaps not, because it's not paranoia if they are truly after you.

If after a long day, your vision of the BD/DVD player is an Adam Sandler comedy or a Hugh Grant romance, this series will be a tough chew.  If you are up for the challenge, Lain is a thought provoking plunge into the dark areas of the mind.  But possibly, it is just as thought provoking that even from such an unpromising environment, the characters are not beyond love and charity.",1350864000,6,1440,4.708
1385079,5,B00005094P,"This is the show that got made it impossible for me to turn back.
I had watched many other series of anime before this one, but none had so thoroughly spoke to me as this one did.
I cannot rate this series highly enough.
It was very sad for me a couple of years ago to go back and watch my DVDs of this series to find i was unable to deal with the interlasing and terrible resolution... i suppose all the new HD anime has really flavored my tastes. So i was understandably overjoyed to find that there was a blueray release in japan, and while i was saving up for it this happens!
EDITS:
Physical media:
This set comes with the restoration book, a huge art book, and dvd and blue ray discs. The books are good quality glossy paper, with cardstock covers. the restoration cover is glossy and the book contains some great color images and a conversation between Saito and Ueda about the problems that occured in each episode on trying to make the release HD. It is quite the gem. the art book's cover is a bit thicker than the restore book and matte. The matte finish gives it a good feel, but it makes it prone to finger prints, especially on the back which is dark blue. This book contains LOADS of line art pictures. there are profile and expressions for every character, including most side characters. there are also scenes and devices. I am really loving the art book.
The bluerays have episodes 1-9 on disk 1 and 10-13 on disk 2,
dvds have 1-7 on disk 1 and 8-13 on disk 2.
im not exactly sure why this is because there are no real differences otherwise. the bluerays do have a different menu that kinda looks like windows 3.1... and the dvds have a standard menu, but the special features are all the same, so why not have the same number of episodes on each disk? just weird.
Another strange thing is that the dvds are in a blu-ray case. it makes the set look cohesive, but it also makes it harder to tell the blu-rays from the dvds. I would have prefered the release to not use standard 2 disk cases opting instead for a custom 4 disk case with some artwork on it, like the japanese release.
Video:
The video quality is good. especially when compared to the 98 pioneer release. i am glad i have that set so i can correctly compare. the new dvds are much, much better than the old ones. i do like that the pioneer release had different menus for each of the 4 discs, but the menu on the new release is generally nicer... it doesn't have that old shadowing effects that were common on late 90's websites for one. The New dvds are down converts of the blu-ray.
i'll say that again. The DVDs are down converts of the Blu-ray.
the compression is SO much better, the style is smoother, the color is more balanced. If you havn't seen the old release you probably wouldn't really tell, but the difference is stunning.
as for the Blu-rays, i could go on forever. The difference between the old dvds and the blu-rays is freaking huge. The only thing is sometimes the lines almost seem too sharp. i mean they went back to the cells and did it by hand, but they didn't redo the cells, so when there were mistakes they become very apparent. i feel like i really like that aspect of it, but i can see that if it were blurry then it might be more likeable to some people. i dunno.
The image is the same aspect as it has always been, 4:3 which is fine for me, better that than cut into the frame and lose detail.
audio:
the audio is pretty much the same. 2.0 dual channel audio. the subs are boring to look at, which is a shame. it would have been nice to see embedded subs for the text portions.. but that isn't really sound related.
the music is just as mood setting and creepy as always.
special features:
the only new thing is the trailers for different funimation shows, and the American commercial for the Blu-ray box. really the pioneer set has more. all the Japanese tv commercials that this set has was there, and there was dev art as well. i suppose tho it works out because the development art is in the Art book. They really could have done alot with the extra space tho, especially for the blu-ray... like half the disc at least is empty.

all in all i have to say this set is a great deal for anyone who likes this series at all. the collection of great stuff would make any collector happy.

1385080,4,B00005094P,"Serial Experiments Lain (SEL) is one of those shows that depends largely on the viewer to determine how good it was. By this I mean, I cannot objectively state that SEL is deeply profound and that if you watch it you will agree. This is an anime filled with deeper meaning for those who seek deeper meaning. Likewise if you're burned out on philosophy do not care to muse over the symbolism of the images, events, characters you will [probably] be uninterested. Having never watched SEL before you might even be surprised that some essays have been written in an attempt to shed light on the subtleties of this show that may confuse or escape the attention of a first time watcher. Funimation has, I believe, wisely included a couple of the first episodes on Youtube so you can develop your first impression of the series.

I, for the record, was very amused. Helps to have the full collection so you can watch from episode to episode. You'll probably want to watch it alone first instead of with friends. You can't really appreciate the series until you understand it and the road to understanding benefits greatly by your introspection. That silent time in your head will let you riddle out the events as they play out and once you've finished the series, you might turn to the web to see if people came to the same conclusions you did. If you enjoyed SEL reading an essay will (no kidding) actually be pretty fun since you'll get a lot of viewpoints you might never have considered. Then you can look like a total boss explaining stuff to your friends when they watch it.

But hey, before you watch know what to expect. SEL is a bit slow paced, decently animated and the subject matter/terminology does not care if you know what it is talking about. Somebody references a technology or old event you have no concept of? Better start Googling with your Internet enabled smartphone. ""We're all connected,"" you know, and Lain called that one ahead of time. ;D

Additionally, SEL does not contain much action, and certainly not fighting action. There will be subterfuge, sabotage, and some violence, but SEL does not over rely on this in order to tell a compelling narrative.

A criticism oft leveled against Lain (main character) is that her personality is as thin as the air around Everest. This is not untrue but the purpose in it lies in showing us the empowering factor of Computers/The Wired. Lain is shy and impotent and real life, can barely connect with her best friend Alice, but after learning how to use The Wired she gradually becomes a celebrity known for her hacking skills and fiery temper. This distortion of personality through internet usage was probably not widely recognized in 1996 (Estimated story draft of SEL). In fact, this new personality becomes so great that it emulates multiple personality disorder. Lain is ultimately held responsible for her actions on The Wired in the real world, dealing a crushing blow to our soft spoken Lain. (I don't want to overstate this of course, they only produced 13 episodes and there was a lot of content to cover.)

Lain's family is relatively docile but we learn latter in the series that all in Lain's life is not how it seems. If you wonder why Lain's parent's seem so distant, then continue wondering so you'll find an answer. Because there are multiple answers that explain Lain's family dynamic leading up to the finale ;)

Alice, Lain's best friend, and easily the most good natured person of the cast, helps towards the end, through her own emotional trials, bring out sympathy for Lain, even if you felt she was a little hard to relate to before. Lain's sister also gets a surprising amount of development.

The story is alright, but the progression doesn't feel entirely linear so you might feel sidetracked by Lain's investigations. It's not certain where these revelations will lead to. Though you can blame that on a trying to boil down such a packed story into 13 episodes. A few extra probably would've helped.

So, as far as reviews go, was this any good? Probably not. But hopefully you find something I said helpful or informative, whether that means you chose to make a purchase or not. With the advent of this new print, the old copies of SEL should see a sharp drop in pricing and may mean good deals online or at the local used bookstore. Still, if you can buy new, I'd encourage it. Nice to see older shows getting some recognition. The 90's sure were a magical time.",1348617600,6,4454,4.679438058748404
1385081,5,B00005094P,"A review of the series based on the previous Geneon release (which I own), just for those who haven't seen it. I will update with the quality of packaging, clarity of the Blu-Ray, and extras once the set is released. But I wanted to give an honest opinion of the series itself and why you should think of pre-ordering it.

Lain is a 1998 anime series that was originally released in the US by Geneon. Funimation has picked up the license (since Geneon is no more) and is releasing this is a shiny new Blu-Ray format. Since it is a 1998 anime, expect the animation quality to be less stellar than more modern series.  But in looking at clips of the Japanese Blu-Ray release, the studio has done a good job at clearing up some of the 'grain' that the DVD showed.  But still expect less 'crisp' animation and outlines. Also, the show is in a regular 4:3 format, not in widescreen.

~~~Some light spoilers~~~
In this creepy and weird semi-sci-fi series, Lain receives an e-mail from a classmate who recently committed suicide. The classmate claims she is not dead but is alive in the net (called the wired here, a twist on the English word weird). Lain then becomes interested in discovering more information, stumbling onto a massive conspiracy by the creator of a particular plot to use the wired to become a digital 'god'. This person also believes that humanity should evolve into digital beings and leave their corporeal bodies behind. His believers carry out actions to proceed with this individual's plans. A rival of this individual is systematically eliminating these believers. So Lain is quickly a central piece in this chess style game with deadly repercussions.
~~~End light spoilers~~~

Philosophical references abound in this series. Similar to Ghost in the Shell, this series delves into the meaning of existence. Are people merely just electric impulses without a soul? Can people live eternally as digital information? Another amazing philosophical quandary is the belief that the world, much like a brain, is interconnected of billions of people (like neurons) communicating instantly (like the electric impulses in the brain), then could the world itself give rise to its own consciousness?

The animation is very good by 1998 standards. The use of light and dark is very well done. When certain colors appear, they are well used, especially reds. It has a kind of cyber look to much of the series (outside of Lain's home). We see shots of phone lines and power wires and hear the hum of electricity in many shots. This serves to highlight the interconnectedness of people. There are many shots also showing train crossings and street crossings, stoplights, neon signs on avenues; all things to show the grouping of people and the lines and paths people follow, much like wires on a circuit board or coding in an internet server system.

The Japanese audio is very well done. This was one of my earlier DVD anime purchases and so I enjoyed tinkering with the language settings. I preferred the Japanese, but I imagine Funimation will put out a very good English dub. But the Japanese audio is quiet and reserved and adds to the ominous feel of this series. There isn't much music. A few points in clubs where there is background audio, and the excellent intro song, but not much else.

If you are into weird and mysterious cyberpunk-esque anime, then give this a whirl. It was one of those series which really changed my outlook on anime, and life to a certain extent. It's meaning is not as intense today as it was around 1999 or 2000. Back then, this series (as well as the film Ghost in the Shell) was cutting edge and even the premise was remarkable. Nowadays other anime series have explored these themes (Ergo Proxy comes to mind) and philosophy is becoming more common in many new series. I admit this series is a bit of turn of the century nostalgia, but it's excellent. It is superbly well written and wonderfully brought to life. If you need flashy animation and lots of action, then this is not for you. If you like cunning, mystery, and weird science fiction style stories, then this is for you.

I heartily recommend this series. I am glad Funimation is re-releasing this gem.  I have also heard this expensive set will include an additional art book feature.  So it's a nice upgrade compared to some of the other expensive Funimation re-releases that have sparse extras.  I have not 100% confirmed this for the US release, but it is highly likely.  I will update as the release date nears.

Update: one of the recent Otaku USA issues has a story about the creation of this series.  It does shed some light on the history and development.  Also the article discusses the hardships of creating the anime on a seriously low budget.  That's why you get a lot of monochromatic, washed out backgrounds.  No budget for more detailed backgrounds.  But it works for the series.  It's all about the story.  So watch this treat, then check out Ergo Proxy if you haven't yet.  =)",1345852800,31,4997,4.739331026528259

1385086,5,B00005094P,"I bought this series a few years back, and each time I watch it again I find something new I had not thought of before. There is a lot of replay value with this anime.

Some things must be said right off hand, this anime is not for everyone. It is not cute, funny, or action packed. It is very slow and deeply complex, so much so in fact, I believe everyone will carry something different away from it by the end. In my opinion, to truly see this work for what it is you need a strong grasp of Psychology, Philosophy, and Metaphysics.

The main things questioned in Serial Experiments: Lain are:
What is God?
What is reality?
What is identity?
Other notable features include heavy symbolism, social isolation, multiple personalities, and the affect of technology on individuals. Being an IT Major the aspect of technology being throw into the mixture was very intriguing.

There is no hard answers to this series, you as the person watching, must uncover and find the meaning to the story being told. If you are not on your 'A-Game' (so to speak) while watching this, you will get lost rather easily. It's worth noting that if you enjoyed the psychological aspects of Neon Genesis: Evangelion, Ghost In The Shell, and Paranoia Agent (to name a few) you should feel very comfortable in watching this anime.

This is a great series if you have an interest in the Metaphysical world, the human psyche, or technology.

The thing that's most striking about this series, other than the fact that it is gorgeously animated (in a stylized way) and written, is how much it essentially predicted the world as it exists today and the direction we will continue to travel in the future.

1385092,5,B00005094P,"There was once a time many years ago when I was a fairly big anime and videogame nerd. It's kind of funny looking back on it all now and seeing how much of a role that the internet played in fueling these various hobbies. After consuming the latest videogame or anime series I would log onto the internet and participate in discussions with other like minded nerds, which would then lead to endless hyperbolic arguments. Everyone had an opinion and no one was ever right about anything. In retrospect, the internet back in those days (of the late 90's) was a much different entity from the beast that it is now.

It seems rather appropriate then that it was on one of these online forums where I first heard about Serial Experiments Lain. From the opening chords of Boa's Duvet (a melancholic pop song that is synonymous with the series), I was instantly hooked and knew that this series was going to be something special. I was introduced to a strange dystopic world. Not so much of a glance into the future, but a horrifying snapshot of our present day and reality. The city had become the jungle and the World Wide Web had become an almost upper layer of it. Always omnipresent and always all around us wherever we may go - this was the stark world that the creators of Lain had envisioned. It was a world of increasingly growing social detachment and alienation where the lines of reality were being blurred by the radical changes of still relatively new and emergent technologies. And much as the Industrial Revolution changed society during the 19th century, the digital era was ushering in something quite new as well.

And while other anime series decided to go the futuristic mecha route with Freudian psycho-babble thrown in for good measure, Lain decided to brand itself as a mishmash of everything that was going on in cyberpunk culture at the time. And along with the rapidly growing advancement of the internet, Lain decided to comment on the wider cultural revolution that the World Wide Web was playing in both Eastern and Western societies alike. It's a Brave New World where every child being born now is being born into a world where the web is not only used as a means of communication/information, but also as an appendage of society itself. From buying things to doing classroom work to downloading media and keeping in touch (social networking) with friends, the internet is playing an increasingly more dominant role in our everyday lives. It is replacing hundred year old traditions with something slightly less tamed, frightening, and new.

When all is said and done, Lain anticipated this ten some odd years ago. It seems to me that the creators of Lain have succeeded marvelously in what they set out to do, which was to intellectually provoke their audience. Indeed, there are countless websites dedicated to the analysis of the convoluted and sometimes complicated plot of Serial Experiments Lain. Even now, ten some odd years later, Lain remains somewhat of an enigma. It's the other Evangelion - Japan's long lost cerebral cyberpunk masterpiece.

1385093,5,B00005094P,"(Written by Ben's 15-year old daughter)

  Serial Experiments:Lain is by far one of the best series I have seen and I am no noob to  anime. (I've seen anything from cowboy bebop to mushishi to inuyasha to desert punk ect.) I've read some of the really bad reviews for this series and found that people either don't understand it or complain about the animation (some were decent reviews with valid points, but they still didn't fully comprehend all that took place)  and I've also read 5 star reviews from people who didn't understand half of what happened. I myself have watched this series over 4 times through (in both langauges) and still absolutly love it.

  Animation: This series doesnt have what you'd call ""clean"" animation, but that is part of its appeal in my opinion. If it had been present in an animation similer to ""Lucky Star"" or even ""Moribito"", I really don't think it would be as meaningful or as captivating. I consider some of the animation to really show thought and hidden meaning, but definitly not the whole series being a a piece of abstract art. The series has a sort of a realistic sense, while maintianing the feel of an anime. The animation is not the point of the anime, though it works in this situation, but it is not something I'd base my opinion of the series on.

  Voice Acting: English dub- I find the english dub to be miserable, and horrendous in comparison to the original japanese version. The voice of Lain, while cast to fufill her role as the timid girl who is unaware of whats happening to her, is very pathetic and cant fully express the range of emotions thats shown throughout the series. Her normal voice is so simaler to her angry and happy voice that it becomes repetetive and dull to listen to her speak. Her friends voices are either irritating or dull. Not to mention the bad translation from japanese to english loses some of the the efforts to pack as much as much meaning as possible into every event that the creators strived for. And for this anime, sinse 80% of it is foreshadowing, thats not something that you could get away with like a series like ""Rurouni Kenshin or Yu Yu Hakusho"" where plot is less than complex. -Japanese Version: Very well done, emotions are fully expressed and the voices blend with and form the personalities of each character and help define thier corrosponding roles in Lains ""life"".

  Music- while music is not a prevalent part of the appeal, it doesnt hurt the series. With few songs, and background music (for when they go to cyberia) the viewer actually is able to focus more on whats taking place, which in this case is very important. The intro is one my favorite songs in(or outside) the world of anime. ""Duvet"" by BoA (the artist of Fukai Mori~ Inuyasha) and is sung in english is so good that I never press the skip button when watching an episode to actually get the story (which in my case is rare). The ending on the other hand is somewhat hard to listen to and is ok, but I wouldn't choose to litsen to it.

  Plot: Ok, now we get to the meat of this series. Please keep in mind that this series requires at LEAST 2 full watch-throughs to fully appreaciate the thought put into it (it's really not hard as the series only has 13 episodes). I won't spoil anything but the first minutes. It starts out with a highschool girl speaking to herself while standing on the edge of a high building, screens with text which seem to reply to her appear on screen. She happily then jumps to her death while the busy ""people""( which are portayed as a general idea/organism on purpose) all react to the situation. Lain, who breifly knew the girl found out that people were getting e-mails from her even though she had died. Lain (who doesnt touch her computer) eventually checks to see if she recieved one too... the initial spark of the plot. This leads into the series where her computer use escalates past obsession and reaches a point where the lines of the Wired (the internet) and reality blur and eventually meld into what is a very insightful and thought provoking examination of life and what it is to be alive. (I know, cliche right? It definitly breaks the boundries :D)

IMPORTANT: I garrantee that you will NOT understand whats happening until episode 4! It's when light is finally put on some of the situation (slightly) and a plot is visable, but even then you really don't know :) Symbolism is everywhere from the telephone lines to the blood-spotted shadows of buildings and  are a constant to the end of the series. The series does drag at points, but it adds more meaning and impact for when the you reach the end. Patience is a virtue!

  Rating: I would gives this an R-rating for there is blood, sexual themes, violence and drug/alchohal use. I personally ( a 15 year old girl), had no problem with it and reccomend it to anyone mature enough to watch it.

  Final Opinion: This is definitly a series that deserves to be seen, one the best out there, and has terrific overall effect. Iv'e shown it to friends who all loved it, all age groups (above maybe 12, I first saw it when I was 13). Please don't skip this anime, you'll miss out. Find a cheaper version, get the slimpack edition, either way, its worth your time.

""Serial Experiments Lain"" is a product of its time. Released on Japanese airwaves in 1998, and on American VHS and DVD by 1999, I can't imagine a series like this being made now, given how mundane many anime series have become as well as the current economic crisis. An intelligent property like this wouldn't be viable, so let's count our blessings this was ever made at all.

Much like the films of David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick, ""Lain"" delves into the often disturbing and perplexing realm of human thought, memories, and anything in between. Fans of action anime or anything else may want to steer clear; the sheer perplexity and open-ended nature of the show is enough to frustrate most and garner academic articles from others. It really is that kind of show.

The show starts with a rather startling suicide, which leads to a number of girls, Lain included, receiving an e-mail from the dead girl explaining that she hasn't really died, and has found God within the Wired - a more advanced version of the internet.

Perhaps by fate or curiosity, Lain persuades her father to buy her the latest Navi computer. Not soon after, she's become enamored and rather obsessed with perfecting and expanding on her already powerful computer. Becoming more a part of the vast world of the Wired, Lain begins to slowly unravel its secrets and finds some disturbing links to its creation in the real world. To explain any further would do the series a disservice, as many of the more eye-opening moments are too difficult and fascinating to give away.

Its apparent script writer Chiaki J. Konaka (The Big O, Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040) and director Ryutaro Nakamura (Legend of Crystania) are either well versed or have an abundant staff who are as interested in cyber punk culture and technological information as they are. Many sequences flow in a slow, often haunting fashion, sometimes interrupted by disturbing imagery or a wealth of on-screen information. The complex story is often tangled in conspiracy theories and scientific jargon, which only serves to either alienate or intrigue you. Before this show, I certainly had no clue about Schuman Resonance, or who Vanaver Bush was. Fascinating stuff.

Though this show will most certainly never have a complete explanation from its creators or maybe even an agreement by fans on the nature of the series, it would take all the fun out of it if anything was given away. Part of the charm of this series is how much ISN'T explained or divulged; like Utena and Evangelion before it, it's far more interesting to try and piece the puzzle together yourself than have everything laid out. This was a show meant to be explored and taken apart bit by bit.

The haunting imagery, subdued and menacing music, and deliberately slow pacing all give the show a very dream-like, ethereal quality that is inherently absent in most animation, Japanese or not. When the build up reaches its crescendo near the end of the series, you'll be hard-pressed not to marathon the rest of the way through just to try and discern everything the show's creators are throwing at you. Without giving too much away, one of the most fascinating scenes in the series takes place without any vicious battles or hardcore trauma. Instead, it's the subtle and delicate interactions between two very realized and human characters. Perhaps that is what Konaka and Nakamura are trying to tell us: that any real understanding between people can only be accomplished outside the boundaries of media, and with simple words and gestures.

This is a series that should not be missed. With an open mind and some patience, it's a disturbing, incredible, and downright bizarre experience.",1247184000,3,3790,4.9109375
1385105,3,B00005094P,"Lain by nature is a series with odds and ends turning at every moment. As the product description describes that the episodes are literally dragged out, indeed they are. If you simply do not have the testing-the-waters-patience to wait for 13 totally episodes of cliff-hangers, avoid this title. Otherwise read on.

-The Animation-

The animation in Lain is neither grainy nor terrible. Do not however, except the shiny-rub polish of 2009 animes. Since the story focuses around the internet, the characters and their worlds are portrayed mostly in a 2D coloring and shading. Expect Patlabor 2: The Movie graphics here in a more updated verison. At times some of the worlds are interesting, such as the internet world. There are several episodes when lain's shadow is casted in a animated mirror/shadow of swirling/ red vortex.

-----------------The Plot---------------------------------------
""Present day, heh, Present Time Hahahaha!""-Serial Experiment Lain Episode Introduction

*Note: Due to the series long plot I will be splitting this review into sections for easy viewing.

-Introduction-

We start out with the main character, Lain. Apparently one of Lain's fellow classmates commits suicide by jumping off of a building. It is then upon that that Lain receives an e-mail from the 'dead girl'. Out of curiosity Lain receives a device that can connect her to the Wired world. Unknowingly though, this very device is the reason why Lain's world is turned upside down. As stated before there are many, many cliff-hangers in this series. This was the most frustrating aspect of this anime. Questions are constantly left unanswered by the characters repetitively to the point that it becomes annoying. Whether Lain ask a question, it goes unanswered, especially questions about herself.

Another downfall of this series is the whack-out proportion between reality and non-reality. There are many times when Lain is talking in the real world then suddenly the plot will switch back to the 'virtual world' as though she was still in the real world. This can make the series confusing to anyone that isn't paying attention to fine details. This can be a benefiting technique but when used repetitively it defeats the purposes, especially if you end up loosing your audience due to a choppy transition. This series wreaks of this until the very final episodes.

-The Break-down of Family ties-

In the beginning Lain's sister is being attacked by a group called the 'Knights' who constantly have been harassing her by the weakening of the two worlds. The 'wired world' has enough power now to influence people and events in the real world. Lain's sister, being their victim. Spamming her constantly with words such as ""Fullfill the prophecy"" until she cracks mentally. I found it idiotic how Lain throughout the entire series couldn't notice the mental-breakdown of her sister even though she had seen her many times. Not only that but the stale acting of Lain's parents is poor. They literally ignore Lain's sister throughout this entire stage, and even when she's spazzing out ""beeping"" noises due to her instability. Both Lain and her parent's showed no concern/emotion for their family members which I found to be totally unrealistic. The only time sadly that Lain's father shows any feeling is towards Lain when he discovers her wired-filled room. He's shocked by the amount of equipment in the room and attempts to 'say' something but as always, no one says anything and lets things be. That was the last time he showed any emotion towards her in the real world.

-Enemies of the Real World-

On the other hand Lain discovers this group named 'Knights'. Apparently they were some sort of hacker group that was causing chaos in the real world. Yet on the other hand they found extreme interest in Lain in her ability to obtain her form and influence in the virtual world. Everyone else in the world comes out as yes, body-parts (such as ears, eyes, lips and even arms) but never full-bodies. They have been imposing as to be ""Lain"" on several occasions, such as Lain being seen in the sky glowing yellow with the clouds parted as a so-called God, or her being a 'peeping tom' or her on television after a car-wreck. These 'Lains' however are not the real-world lain herself, but the 'Lains' from the memories of everyone. Or simply to put it, what they want Lain to be. It doesn't help either when Lain becomes so addictive to the wire that she's surfing the internet during class and hooking wires over herself in her room for countless hours that we never see her actually 'eat' or take a 'break', despite her 'only' friend, Asuri's concern. In the beginning they seem to be Lain's friends, but later she discovers that she was being used as nothing more than a playtoy to them. When she disagrees to their antics, they try to destroy lain by sending her a global virus that blows the windows out of her room. However lain escapes this by the help of mysterious  men-in-black (no pun intended). Lain ask them who they are, and in a contradictory fashion they say they are 'Knights' but are not the 'Knights' in the virtual world. There's been a dialogue issue here, as the real-world knights are nothing more than a collection of average to coporate-people using those 'pyscho chips' that were trying to make Lain like their God.

-The History of Protocol 7 and KIDS-

We discover through Lain's investigation that an old man labled as the 'child killer' was the start of the 'internet merging' circumstances. Apparently he was experiencing with the 'untapped' mental state of human children and focusing this energy into 'psychic' energy that be harnessed to create one information system. This however, caused too much energy and caused the plant to backfire, destroying all the children in the process. Lain is upset at his lack-of-heart attitude but the man says that there is 'nothing he can do to bring them back'. Then why is he resting in a hospital in a paradise world (using the Wire) than rotting in a cell? This anime never ceases to amaze me with again, the lack of care for anybody. It is then when this anime takes facts from the real world (yes, our real world. History books opened please) about gimmicks about how the entire 'Alien Theory' started and the very beginnings of how the internet was being established before missing it into the gooble-ge-gook of the anime's plot.

-Wipe Out-

The group known as 'Knights' becomes exposed to Lain. Once their identities have been made, the 'Men In Black' come to sweep them clean of their troubles by annihilating them, with them later on mysteriously being 'killed' by seeing images of Lain and a mysterious figure. So with Knights out of the way the wire will return to it's normal functioning state right? Not so. Apparently another being is responsible for the havoc of the wire. We then began to learn and probably suspect in the earlier episodes that lain is simply not 'human' but a program designed by the very man who had died on a train-track. Nothing remains of this man but his virtual 'conscience' which he strives in being 'God'.

-Her Only Friend-

As i've said before Asuri is Lain's only friend. That until a dirty secret about her doing some 'private things' to herself is let loose over the wire. And Lain is the blame. When Lain meets her at school she truly doesn't understand what's going on. Asuri's friends instantly ditch Lain but Asuri decides to give Lain a chance. This however, is ruined as Asuri sees Lain on her bed while she's giving herself a R-rated lesson on a comp chair.

-Secrets revealed and friendships collapse-

Asuri of course is terrified and feels violated as she wanted to keep that naturally as a tender secret, it is then she avoids Lain in school and truly believes that she did it, telling Lain that she 'saw her in her room' as a creepy midget with a nasty smile. Lain is visited by this creature as a smiling alien. She goes on the Wire to find out who this really 'is' where this virtual-lain explains that all information should be shared on the wire. Lain tries to choke this imposter but oddly it feels 'warm to the touch' in which the imposter laughs and says 'i'm committing suicide!' This leads to the conclusion that maybe Lain isn't the only 'Lain' but that there really is another lain. This Lain I will call Virtual Lain.

-Alone Lain-

In the end Lain's parents simply get up and 'go' with her father explaining to her that he was almost jealous of her 'free will' and that their time with her was to an end. Her sister just vanishes. This of course leaves lain 'broken' in a way where she's just laying locked up in her room with wires tangled around her body, constantly 'wired' in a zombie-like state. It is then in the wired world where she is being talked into suicide, that she doesn't 'need' a body. Lain takes the gun in hand questioningly until the girl that killed herself in the first episode shows. With a sad look on her face she tells Lain that 'Death Isn't Easy' and may show signs of regret of doing so as she is nothing more than memories of her life. Asuri, remembering what has happened while everyone else suddenly 'forgets' (thanks to the helpful erasing powers of Lain) goes to visit Lain to find out the truth.

-Reality and Wired are One-

After traveling through the neglected muck-of-house she stumbles upon Lain contained in wires. Lain then sits up talking some gobble-de-gook about her being a program. While Asuri tries to make sense of this the 'God' appears to Lain, telling her that she should connect with her friend if she loves her as she claims. Asuri stands there baffled as she watches lain talking to air until a digital hand appears when he says she needs to be debugged. Lain confronts 'God', saying that without her none of his progress would have worked and who created him. As soon as she starts talking to him about him not having a body and therefore not being 'real' he explodes. A vortex-like wrap appears in which random flesh is being drawn into and machine. A tangled mass of what appears to be a man is 'growing' out of this mass, despite Asuri's frantic screams. ""What do you need a body for?"" Lain says as this nasty squirting mass wraps its 'tentacles' around the two females, growing a big eye and a nasty zombie-like head in the process.

-Reset-

Apparently this being got physics punched by Lain because a big hunk of machine slammed into it's body. Then it just absorbed all the rest of Lain's expensive equipment until it became nothing more than a huddle of metal. Lain tries to say to Asuri that everything is okay. However just as Lain's sister Asuri 'cracks' from everything and ends up scratching Lain's face with a slap. Lain cries, telling Asuri that she is sorry and ends up erasing the world of her memories. Life continues for the best as everyone forgets about Lain, although she does 'pop-up' to a few people. In the end Lain is only left with Virtual Lain who tells Lain to 'start-over' again until Lain sends her packing, leaving her all alone. Lain is left to cry until her father appears, telling her that he loves her. This causes rivers of tears to flow down Lain's lonely face.

-Non-existance-

'Years' later Lain appears in the real-world to her friend Asuri who is now in her 20's. Asuri doesn't recognize Lain but goes to investigate her, telling her that she 'recalled her from before' but Lain goes by saying that they 'never-met'. So to wrap up the story it's as though Lain never existed in the real-world yet she can visit the real-world to see Asuri anytime she wishes.

-The Themes-
There are 3 major themes throughout Serial Experiment Lain. Homocide, Suicide, God.

The girl in Lain's school commits suicide by jumping off a building and becomes a bloddy mess on the ground. Several people shoot themselves or get shot at. Even lain's wired self laughs gleefully as it exclaims that she is 'committing suicide'. Seriously how old is Lain, 13? Another is the self-proclaimed God theme running throughout the show that can also be offensive. First knights are 'gods' then Lain is a God then 'God'(the man who made prototype 7 which is Lain) is a God. The belief that mankind can become 'God' simply by their mental advancement capacities. Ironically Lain admits ""there must be God"" in the end. And as much as the shock-factor of the characters are done, I believe that this series has over-done it. Why isn't anyone actually brave for once? Must I hear the constant drizzly whining of 13 year olds?

Overall Review:

Good:

-Long Plot Story
-Nice intro theme by Boa
-Nice chunk of episodes spanning to 4 dvd cases
-Plot twist
-The 'virtual flesh' scene by the fake God was cool.
-Some of the artwork was nice
-Asuri seemed like the only realistic character that responded realistically to her surroundings. Oh, and she actually cared for someone.

Bad:

-Dragged, dragged, dragged out storyline proves irritating.
-Showing no emotions to your suffering family is cold, mechanical and not realistic concerning how everything else freaks out.
-Sometimes you want the show to 'get to the point'
-Constant flipping between Lain's real-world and Lain's Wired world is a choppy transit and can leave the viewer confused on what their seeing.
-Themes of Suicide/Mental Instability/Questioning one's existence and homicide runs this show. Beware.
-God God God. Everybody wants to rule the world.
-There should have been an interesting fight scene with the virtual flesh-man instead of a sudden and dull ending by a piece of metal.
-Lain went through all that just to delete herself out of existence? Boo.
-Whinny emotional teens has been over-done at some points.
-Why can't someone be brave in this show???
-Some characters have said things that make no sense (That 24-year oldish-MIB (Men In Black) guy telling Lain that he 'Loves her' yet only meet her in one episode briefly?? What!?Ew.)
-Lain sister cracks and no one cares. The characters can be self-centered.
-Some adult-orientated material such as 'drug packets' and 'sexual situations'

Overall Score:
3.0 out of 5.0

Serial Experiments Lain plot was dragged far too long and it's choppy transit sequence came to bite the series back. It would have been nicer for some fights scene than constantly witnessing characters either cracking up or dying. It's overdone.

1385106,5,B00005094P,"This series not only opened my eyes...it literally changed my life.

I've experienced the whole series many times, always letting it probe my mind to provoke thoughts I didn't know existed. This isn't a review, if you want to know what the series is like, watch it, or rather let it watch you.

After studying the series for a while I became deeply interested in computers, computer science, philosophy, mind-expansion, and theory. I related to Lain on such a personal level that the show almost seemed to transcend the subtext of it just being a work of fiction. But then again Serial Experiments Lain blurs the thin boundary that is reality and the virtual. The concepts and information shown at parts is very much worth looking into as well (E.I. Shuman resonance (commonly)7.83Hz). The integration into the story seems entirely possible in the future.
The concept of the wired is in itself one of the most intriguing and glorious things i've ever heard of. Cyberpunk nirvana I suppose would be a way of looking at it. I could write for days on this work of art, but i'll limit myself here.

If you do decide to watch it, you must commit to the whole series, or you'll probably be confused or misled. The series comes full circle like i've rarely seen any other do before.

On a side note, the series is also an incredible psychonaut tool :D

It's unfortunate because this anime really deserved more success and recognition than it got. Perhaps it is due to the atypical story and eerie, paranoid production...but therein lies this series' appeal. It is delightfully creepy and thought-provoking while being a compelling sci-fi story to boot and it doesn't rely on cliches like fan-service or violence to draw you in. Any serious otaku should already have seen this series...if you haven't, see it now!!! As a side note: this anime went out of print when Geneon got out of the DVD business.

1385108,5,B00005094P,"""Lain"" is one of those anime series that surpasses your expectations, leaves you speechless, confused and completely engrossed in the storyline. Lain is a teenager who gets an e-mail from a classmate that committed suicide. She tells her that she is alive, that she left the flesh and lives at The Wired. This starts Lain's quest to find out the truth about The Wired, an enormous computer network, like the Internet, but it is actually a reality apart from the physical world.

Lain starts to find out the truth about The Wired and sees her life change in the process. This is an amazing series that deals with philosophy, identity, culture, reality, computers, and the ever-changing culture and way of life of people due to technology. It is truly one of the deepest and most amazing series I have ever seen. This is one to watch.",1219276800,2,832,4.698630136986301

1385110,4,B00005094P,"If this series didn't make you sit down and think about your own perceptions of reality then you definitely didn't get this series.  I spent a large portion of this series thinking it was highly influenced by the Matrix... until I looked at the date and found that ""Serial Experiments Lain"" was out well before the Matrix.  Now I wonder if the Matrix was influenced by this.  Part of me says it must have been!  Ah well, that's what I get for watching things so long after they came out.  Either way I did quite enjoy this series' philosophical concepts quite a bit.

The animation and story sequence is very surreal on both fronts.  To be honest, I wasn't very into the way it was ""filmed"".  It was very disruptive and always made you question what you were watching.  I realize this is pretty much the whole point, but they almost did TOO good of a job blurring the scenes of reality and the virtual, which is basically the whole series concept.  Just part of me wishes the lines were a little more well defined, so I wouldn't have to constantly be assaulted with ""is this real?""  However, it forces you to really think about what you're watching, so my preferences aside this is insanely well thought out!  ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is about questioning the perceptions of reality and how you define yourself as a real person or as a virtual person.  I assume this was influenced by the explosion of the internet and how people represent themselves as they'd like to see themselves, not how they are in the real world.  So ""Serial Experiments Lain"" asks the question of it's viewers about how they see their real selves, and which one is, in fact, more real?

The story circles around a girl named Lain and you never quite know if she's a person in the real world, or if she's a construct in the virtual world.  But how different is the real world versus the virtual world?  I'm not going to claim that I understood every little detail of this series, but it appears to be quite well researched because it references scientists that worked on these concepts, and even the concept of a global conscious network (basically our current connection without the computer hardware).  Bizarre occurrences happen when Lain is interacting with the real world, people either go mad, or they die, sometimes both.  I imagine this is due to the fact that blurring the two lines that much forces people to wonder who they are and their brains just snap on the pressure.  Lain is a real consciousness, of course, but her concept of ""self"", as it is proposed is just software.  An executable file, as the show states.  This also brings us to the question of deity, as in who programmed this executable file?  God?  One thing I loved was that the series proposes that the consciousness of mankind could overcome whatever humanity perceives as deity, because it asks the question of ""who made you God?""  By what right do you rule our species and world?  And also presents the concept that God is only God if that deity has worshippers, even if there is just one.  Something very close to a theory I have quite often pondered upon.  So what happens if there are no more worshippers?  Is that deity still God?  If not then what is God?  As you can see ""Serial Experiments Lain"" is definitely designed for those who really want to think about the world around them and their role in it.  Lain frequently asks ""am I me?""  Always trying to define herself, always asking where she belongs.

This review may seem fairly disjointed, but it certainly fits the spirit of the series in my opinion.  I imagine that many will be really intrigued by this and this should definitely screw with your mind a little after watching it.  It really makes you ponder where you are in life and is that where you belong... is it really you?  While some of the filming concepts are kind of annoying I see their point, except for ""Infornography"", most of that episode annoyed me.  Other than that they were all well done, even if a little hard to follow at times.  I think some people will outright hate this due to its very bizarre feel and they won't be able to move beyond that.  However, I think this is kind of geared towards the techno savvy generation, especially those into hacking and other concepts of free information.  If any of these concepts seem appealing to you, then I would definitely recommend you check out this series!",1216425600,,4397,4.571611253196931

Great choice of soundtrack, well-chosen characters and lack of redundant episodes with little relevance to the main theme are other points of strength.

But this is an important anime about religion and the truth.  Lain is a girl in her early teens who sees strange images.  Images blur into child-like sketches.  Steam floats out of her hands into a mysterious web over her in the classroom.  Her friend, Chisa Yomoda, dropped off a building and died.  Yet, she still sent an e-mail that said that she hadn't died.  She merely lost her body in order to integrate herself into the wired world (the internet).

Lain discovers that she is a powerful girl, capable of transfiguring the real world via her mind.  Although the series doesn't specify how she can do it, her mind is capable of changing events in the real world from her consciousness in the wired.  She also learns that other people are using the wired to kill girls and boys with games and programs.  This group of technology freaks is known as Knights.  The Knights are led by an old scientist who committed suicide to integrate himself as the god of the wired.

If this sounds twisted and confusing to you, don't worry.  This series, by design, is meant to confuse people at first.  The language can also confound people who aren't into technology, because the characters talk about ""databases"", ""protocols"", and fancy processors and data compressers.  However, for anyone who is willing to watch this series multiple times, they will see that Lain is a small girl who is willing to do anything to stop the Knights and destroy any bad memories of herself from her friends.

I believe that this is one of the most important anime series of all time, and one of my absolute favorites.  ""Serial Experiments Lain"" forces people to think about how the world of the internet can nearly take over our own lives.  Do you feel like the internet is your only release from social pressures in the real world?  If so, ""Serial Experiments Lain"" might be the cure for you.",1180569600,5,2198,4.684073107049608

Other than that, each ""Layer"" is interesting in what it brings to the whole and, what is says entirely as an isolated episode.  In many regards, Lain is a series which can be viewed chronologically, but needn't necessarily be.  Oh, and the series boasts one of the best uses of music out there (though there's not much of it in the series).

1385122,4,B00005094P,"THE STORY:
Beyond the soft hum of information passing through cables, beyond the gentle glow of computer screens there lies another world. The world of the Wired. Lain is an introverted, but otherwise seemingly normal 13 year old girl. When a classmate commits suicide, and everyone from her school starts receiving e-mails from her, Lain becomes increasingly interested in the world of the Wired. The Wired is akin to our internet - accessed by computers called NAVIs. Lain asks her father for a new NAVI, and it doesn't take long before the barrier between the ""Real World"" and ""The Wired"" starts crumbling. What is the Wired? What is the Real World? Who is Lain? The only common theme you will find is that:

""We're All Connected.""

REVIEW:
The one common word you will read/hear used to describe Lain is ""weird"". Yes, it is that, but it's much more. Being a Japanese anime, I can't be completely sure what its influences are, but Lain very much reminded me of a David Lynch approach applied to an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>&nbsp;season with bits and pieces of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00012QLQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell/dp/6304493681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evangelion/dp/B000767QTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evangelion</a>&nbsp;thrown in. The thing that will throw most off is the completely abnormal narrative of Lain. We're shown inexplicable things without explanation, opaque symbolism crops up everywhere, and all the while the viewer is left to wonder ""Just what is real?"" and ""Just what the hell is going on?"".

To those used to Lynch's approach to film-making - especially something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulholland-Drive/dp/B00005JKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulholland Drive</a>&nbsp;- Lain MIGHT not be so confusing. That's because you become used to spotting ""red herrings"", so to speak, and understand that everything you're shown - no matter how emphasized at the time - may be inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. The best advice I could offer when going into Lain is to have no pre-conceived notions about what is or should be real or important. Let the narrative flow and if you simply take things as they come, without analyzing them, it will seem much less confusing than some make it out to be.

The animation quality in Lain is rather unspectacular. However, I'd say the visuals throughout are quite good. The animators play off dark/light themes with colors splashing the darkness to create a really psychedelic feeling which perfectly matches the mood of the series. This semi-minimalistic approach works extremely well and adds to the sense of mounting ominousness throughout. From the very beginning they're able to use this approach to create a sense of disconnect and discontent between both Lain and the Real World and the viewer and Lain's world.

The pacing is incredibly slow. If you feel the need for alot (or any, really) action in your anime, steer clear  from Lain. At times, Lain is so slow it feels as if its standing still in its own dream-like world. If it's one negative thing I could say about Lain it's that the pacing is just a bit too inchoate at times, seemingly lacking direction or real motion. This was perhaps done intentionally to create the effect of being in some kind of dream - or at least being disconnected from anything that's real. It only ""flows"" in its own dream-like trance towards its ending, although at times you'll be wondering how it arrived there.

Lain will overload you with information. Government conspiracies, Aliens, nano-technology, psychic children experiments, secretive organizations both real and fictional, powerful computer programs and protocols... One episode interlaces the narrative with a history of certain scientific discoveries - and the people and organizations behind them. After viewing it, one wonders how everything connects. I'd be daft if I said that by the end, it all connects in a very neat, coherent manner. However, an astute viewer will likely be able to link most of the references to the fictional world of Lain in a roundabout manner. I'm convinced that most everything referenced plays an important part either as influence or to the direct narrative, but linking it all together would be difficult.

The ideas discussed throughout Lain are fairly extensive. Many are only touched on, but others go a little deeper. Just some of the ideas include the subjective nature of reality and self, commincation and the collective connectivity, the role of information both in a tangible and intangible sense (memory). Basically, there's the more tangible ideas discussed in the latter paragraph, and the more intangible ideas discussed in this one. In the end, you're left with a very complex and multi-layered narrative that just begs for exploration. Even if you're able to extract the main ideas on first viewing (like I was), you'll likely want to enter the world of Lain again to discover even more.

Are there other negatives I could find about the series? Only a few. The ending is rather disappointing after all that's lead up to it. This is mostly a pacing and amount of content problem. You'll find many anime series have this problem where they run out of ideas to fill episode time near the end, so they have to find a way to stretch things out. Lain does this quite badly. The actual ""ending"" just goes on too long, and doesn't give a sense of closure. Evangelion had the same problem with the TV ending, which is a big reason why they had to create the film to give fans that sense of closure. I'd also say it's only slightly disappointing from a dramatic standpoint. From the beginning there's this sense of ominous foreboding. Something big is brewing and poor Lain is right in the midst of it. But by the end, the ""big evil"" off in the distance didn't seem so bad afterall.

Even with a lack of adept pacing and a dramatic ending that gives a sense of closure (for my tastes) only amounts to small complaints. They're small when one realizes how truly rich the rest of Lain is. All in all, Lain still remains a highly influential and extremely original anime. It might've borrowed from many that came before it, but it melded and morphed into something that was completely new and different. For that it deserves all the praise it gets. Even though I can't say it is perfect, it is still superb. I even feel the creators have gone on to take the ideas and style they cultivated with Lain and utilized it to greater and more mature effects in future works such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Texhnolyze/dp/B000FJGR6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Texhnolyze</a>. But I still highly recommend this series to those looking for something truly unique, original, and yes, ""weird"" in the world of anime.

DVD REVIEW:

This set is fairly bare-bones. 4 discs featuring very little in the way of extras. No anamorphic widescreen, no 5.1. I imagine it won't be long before Lain is given a fairly lavish makeover and re-issued for its 10th anniversary. However, the current price makes up for the lack of goodies.",1176940800,6,7521,5.435304198800343
1385123,4,B00005094P,"This was quite a bizarre little series.  This really isn't your typical action-packed anime with a fight scene every 5 minutes, this one has a much slower pace to it, relying more on the dialogue and development of the characters, rather than ""who beat up who"".  It goes down to a deeper, much more psychological level.  Right to the bone, in fact.  This was a very rewarding series for me.  While it's not entirely perfect, nor entirely flawed, I think the mood it sets for the viewer is terrific.",1171324800,,498,4.550561797752809
1385124,5,B00005094P,"What the? that's the most common reaction i know for this series. while it may not make sense, it's a sight to be seen. It's few intense action scenes and amazing soundtrack made it the cult classic it is today.",1170720000,,211,4.3
1385125,5,B00005094P,"Ummm... No. The first episodes are not a false reality, in my opinion. Alice/Arisu is stated as never having connected with her... so Lain's conciousness can't have been in the wired- only the collected conciousness of the earth (which is what lain is... she's the product of Masami Eiri's 7th protocol, which connects humans together subconciously through the earth's subconcious (each human a hieuristic neuron)- that's why Lain is omnipresent in the Wired. But she's also present in te real world...

or is she?

That's the kind of thinking this story will have you thinking.",1161561600,,587,5.09375
1385126,5,B00005094P,"One thing the writer, director, and art director agreed upon was this; in the end, they wanted the viewer to love Lain.

And that's what I think about most when I watch this series: I love this creature.

Maybe that's wierd, but that's the kind of exceptional character development Chiaki J. Konaka put into this masterpiece. And yes, it's wierd; mixing the nuerotic with the psychotic with the psychadelic and post-modern, Serial Experiments Lain offers up a massive and intricately complex storyline, drawing on everything from Roswell to Timothy Leary's 8 Circuit Model of Conciousness, Project Xanadu and the Shumann Resonance. But these are just the plot devices, just the means by which

the creators bring into question polular concepts of God, memory, reality, and self.

Even a basic story outline wouldn't cover everything that needs to be said in order to grasp the depth of S.E:L, so I won't. Suffice it to say that it is dark, disturbing, and utterly depressing: it fills one with such compassion for this poor confused girl... or whatever she is, made more confused by her other identities present in the Wired, which Lain is aware of because she is omnipresent in the Wired (because of Eiri's 7th protocol and the Shumann Resonance and the Psyche Chip and and and and!!!!!!!!!!!!)

See? It's complicated.

Though Neon Genesis Evangelion was much darker thematically (I mean, Armageddon?), and the characters' personalities perhaps darker, I would argue that the world view expressed in Serial Experiments Lain is by far darker... that you can lose control of you identity through other people's memories of you... and that existence is based off of that memory... something about that is so depressing...anyways...

Let's all Love Lain!",1161561600,5,1751,5.101398601398602
1385127,5,B00005094P,"Serial Experiments: Lain is an anime series which tells the story of a mysterious young girl called Lain Iwakura.

At first, it appears that Lain is a fairly normal, though deeply introverted, teenage girl growing up in bourgouis Japan.  In her room there are many symbols of fading innocence, in particular, her collection of dolls and teddy bears which seem to lose substance in the Sun.

Lain has several close friends, who try and coax her out from her shell into taking a more active role in life.

Things seem to change when a fellow student, Chisa, commits suicide by leaping off a roof.  Soon afterwards, a mysterious email starts circulating on the email system of the school purporting to be Chisa and saying 'you don't need bodies.'  This message reaches Lain and in a very sinister twist, 'Chisa' seems to want to meet Lain herself.

From there on the story gets more strange and complex.  Lain's father buys a complex and powerful home computer from the Tachibana corporation, which seems associated (as we later find out) with dubious activities bordering on the criminal.  One of the corporation's scientists seems to have gone 'rogue' and conducted bizarre experiments, and also the mysterious Knights Templar get into the equation.  At the same time, Lain gets a new computer and gets 'immersed' in the online world of the near future which is the successor to the internet (known as the Wired) and reality seems to start coming apart.

As the series progresses the borderlines between the 'real' world and the 'online' world of the Wired seem to dissapear, and whatever events happen in one world affect the other world.  Towards the end, it seems that both worlds merge into a single reality with 'dual' manifestations, while Lain is transformed from an ordinary schoolgirl into a very different Being.

This anime series is very interesting and raises some perplexing questions, especially in relation to our postmodern condition, our relation to our technology, the ontological status of our world and the 'online' world, and the possibilities of existence.  It also explores the boundaries between fact and fiction, between myth and reality, and the series contains many allusions to modern conspiracy theories (ranging from aliens and Area 51 to the Knights and Illuminati) as well as some religious questions, such as the survival of mind after death and of God.

The series seems to conclude, much like other postmodern animes, we are free to choose and make our own reality, given all reality is dependent on the subject and relative to the subject.  This paradoxically gives anyone, even someone as quiet and innocent as Lain, the powers traditionally attributed to divine beings.  We can choose this power and use it in conjunction with technology for either good or evil, and the destruction of the scientist who tries to control Lain (claiming at one point to be her 'father'), the Knights, and others who through pride tried to be 'Gods', in contrast to Lain who acquiries it through love and compassion (in many ways she becomes like a Buddhist goddess of compassion or Boddhisattva) seems to show we can use such great power for great good.

The message of this series is quite positive and uplifting, especially in contrast to darker animes like Neon Genesis Evangelion.",1161302400,4,3304,4.9763636363636365

1385133,1,B00005094P,"My 1 star comes without anger, or snobism or anything. I didn't curse it but watched it patienly and accepted the bad and the good stuf that it had. But I have to think twice the next time I consult amazon for buying an anime because there is definetly something wrong with the people reviewing some of the anime (Evangelion is the first paradox but I would speak about it with curses and stuff like that (0 stars) while I respect Lain).

 So I would also like to think that people who write these reviews don't belong to those who created the anime because that would suck a lot. Whatever this is what I think about Lain

 1. ANIMATION. Stop bothering about the animation. I always read animation is good, bad, fantastic etc. From my experience if the story is good animation is the least factor that one should consider when buying an anime. (For example when I watched the first episode of Gilgamesh which really sucked concerning animation the story draw my attention in following it-Lain don't really) In our case the animation is in simple scetches, with bright colors and in general its quit good and enjoyable to watch. The directing is also very good keeping in mind that the director hasn't much to show due to the slow pace of the story.

 2. STORY. Lol first of all how can you read reviews buy guys and (children mostly I believe) who don't get the story. They say its too much complicated, strange, difficult etc. The story isn't complicated at all. Add to the general story that you ready in the dvd a couple of sentences and you have the entire story!!! However, its the way the story is presented here that it tends to confuse you and think -Oh I missed that- etc.

  The whole concept is ok and a fine idea. But put into action they really mess up as they try to spread a 2 or 3 episode story into 13! I am sorry to dissapoint you but you don't have a clue guys.

  Add to the basic theme some philosophical issues raised by the characters which get repetitive and in the end miss the whole point of even being mentioned ---they talk and talk about theological, or moral issues but only in theory as in the end they are nowhere found to be implemented.

  Only in the last 3 episodes the story seems to progress a while and give a ""revelation""which is not really such a big deal. While watching the episodes I kept thinking how they seem to get the idea of an episode of x-files where a guy uploads his personality into the computers and lives through the internet etc. They throw some more ideas and they have the story where some poor kids don't understand squat and think that OW THESE GUYS KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. There are no hidden messages. Just because they throw some words and ideas like the collective subconsiousness doesn't mean they know what they do!!!

SPOILER So the story is about LAIN whose first episodes are a false reality as she really exists only in the ""internet"" but gets a taste of the real word which is connected to the internet world until she realizes what she really is and how she can affect both worlds. Of course you have to assume all these as they keep on throwing some mixed ideas, that their aim is to get you confused.

THIS DVD IS DEFINETELY RATED R--->for presenting suicidal ideas, and what might be for some people offensive theological issues.

To sum I expected to whatch something clever really, with a good story being a bit originall. It should be clear to me though that when the people review it a say it was ""strange, confusing, complicated, difficult, don't understand much"" then something must be wrong.

Again it could be a good anime, had potention but people messed it up. How can you give a high review to something you don't understand. My understanding is that they tried to insulted my intelligence by creating a story while there is none to be told.",1138147200,16,3857,4.460881934566145
1385134,5,B00005094P,"Even for a lifetime Japanese speaker like me, Lain is a difficult series to understand fully, with all its cybertalk and metaphysical musings.  This is why I prefer watching it with subtitles, which are topnotch by the way.  It's obviously done by a very skilled translator, which is not always the case, unfortunately.  Interestingly enough, the subtitles are not always the same as the dubbed dialogue.  You'll discover this when you watch the dubbed version with English subtitles.

Now, if you're wondering ""Why Lain for a Japanese girl's name?"" it's because her name is written in Chinese characters ""Sound of a Bell"" which is read ""Rei-in.""

So to start off:

First off, the visual style of Lain is the most impressive I've seen in years. Quirky, haunting, grounded in contemporary Japan with a heavy futurist streak - it's absolutely stunning. Cinematic framing and transition effects are used throughout the series. Pay attention to the scenes of Lain at her family's dinner table and how the point of view shifts/is shifted. The character animation is excellent. Watch, for example, Lain's expression as she sits in front of her bank of computer terminals, lost in communication with The Wired. Despite the minimal facial features used throughout the series, a wide range of emotion is clearly communicated. The characters are well drawn. Each of Lain's family members and friends has a unique physical trait that sets him or her apart.

Oh and don't worry everyone...It isn't just you, this series is pretty confusing.

I loved it but i reccommend people research about it and all their anime first before buying it. Here is a helpful site... WWW.ANIMENEWSNETWORK.COM

  It's the story of Lain, a young school girl. Her relationships with her ""Parents"", sister, friends and the ""wired"" (what they call the internet). The series starts with Lain and her friends getting email from a dead friend and gets weirder from there.",1134000000,2,851,4.5064935064935066
1385138,3,B00005094P,"While Lain is a short series, comparatively, it seems very long thanks to its sluggish plot. If you expect a story to be told to you while watching this, you are only half correct. The author intentionally leaves countless loose ends in the series, which the viewer has to tie up however (s)he see fit. While such extensive use of symbolism allows viewers to personalize the series as much as they like, such freedom of interpretation ultimately rings hollow for the average viewer. The author uses countless references to obscure internet trivia, electronic trivia, computer history, abstract art, and loose symbolism when constructing the plot. Unless you are well versed in these areas or have ample free time to look them up, watching Lain will most likely be irritating. However, people who see religious faces in food and/or appreciate Pablo Picasso's work will likely love this series.",1133308800,3,892,5.074829931972789
1385139,3,B00005094P,"This series is an amazing series for a number of reasons; unfortunately many of the die hard fans who fell in love with Lain for various reasons have set unrealistic views forth of what Lain really is (and is not).

The series has a number of high points, for instance the storyline is extremely cool - the idea of a girl being interconnected in someway with computers and or the internet (so as not to spoil anyone's potential appetite for the series I won't be giving a lot of detail as to what the series involves). Another high point is that the visuals are done decently (not terrific, but then again the style in which it was drawn sacrifices ""high quality"" in place of ""cute"" and ""beautiful"" on a mediocre level).

Lain has a number of flaws though. The series is extremely slow, and anyone who thought Witch Hunter Robin was a little on the slow side would probably think of killing themselves after watching Lain. Is the sloth-like pace at which Lain goes bad? It can be... the truth is it's somewhat warranted, given the seriousness of Lain's circumstances surrounding her throughout the series it's no wonder long introspective scenes were used. Unfortunately some animes come across as overly pretentious... this might be one of them - everything in Lain (including the cool storyline) has been done before, and in some cases, much better.

This isn't a series for breaking any sort of conventions in either a graphical sense or as far as story goes - the idea of a young girl suddenly becoming a pivotal figure in the course of human events and or machines has long since been used in Japanese mangas. Unfortunately Lain takes itself a tad bit too seriously, and fans who love anime but who are not well versed in mangas or different types of animes might get caught up in the storyline thinking it is terribly original.

If you have seen quality animes in the past involving philosophical themed material then you will not find Lain all that ""confusing."" The ideas are simply not that original, but what it does do is let you experience those elements through the eyes of an adorable young girl.

Yes... there are a number of things I do like about the series.

The main character's innocence is best illustrated throughout the series by the way in which she acts. In the beginning of the series she comes across as a nave school girl with little computer experience while all of her friends are speaking with boyfriends and the like on their computers. As time passes she turns from that into... well, saving the good parts for those that have actually seen the series, let's just say she advances quite a bit! If you're into ""serious"" animations please do not turn this one up for a second!

Seeing Lain in a teddy bear outfit is almost worth watching the first episode for - an episode which you might find extremely boring... again though: give it a chance and I'm sure you'll like it for what it is. However, again I'd like to stress that before people make wild claims about the series being original they consider some of the other films that have come before and after Lain... there is no need to over dramatize the high points in the series: if the viewer likes the series, he or she will know when they're done with it what all the fuss was about (and they'll also be able to objectively discern some of the major faults in the series as well). My rating of 3 or 3 1/2 stars is based on my dislike for the other elements in the series, but many who have watched Lain /found/ those elements and didn't consider them that devistating... so feel free to formulate your own opinions.

As far as technical issues are concerned this DVD set is in perfect order and one which Lain fans should most certainly get! Again, hope you enjoy the series and watch it with both an open mind as well as a scrutinizing eye.

This is certainly a series to rent before you buy it!!! Enjoy!",1132012800,15,3893,4.542082738944365
1385140,5,B00005094P,"If one were to describe this anime series with one word, there would be none better than the title of the first episode: WEIRD. But this description would only scratch the surface, and below that we find a rich and complex plot that transports the viewer through an array of emotions and states of mind. At times you will be baffled, at others elated, and in between you will try to grasp the tiny details that make this one of the most enigmatic series I have ever watched.

The story starts when a young girl kills herself and soon afterwards her classmates start to get emails from the deceased. Lain is one of the students getting the messages, and she is an introverted kid who has problems relating to others. This results in Lain being eager to understand more about the mysterious ""ghost"" and learn about The Wired, which is a world that allows people to escape reality (similar to our Web). But what happens when the two worlds start merging, and what people though was fiction begins to affect their lives?

As the series progresses, the duality between The Wired and the real world virtually disappears, and the effects are extremely interesting to observe. Questions will begin to pop-up in your head, in similar vein to those presented in ""The Matrix"". At some points, the series may get complex and confuse you, but keep at it, the rewards are worth the ""pain"".

It is not usual to find films in this genre that deal so well with psychological and existential issues, and even those that did not like this series have to recognize that at least it possess originality and deviates from the standard path followed by so many anime directors (evil vs. good with lots of fights and blood).

In terms of the graphics, you will not find anything extraordinary there, especially in terms of the settings, since the level of detail is rather poor. But I believe that this was probably done on purpose, since in this way the viewer is be forced to focus her attention on the more important aspects of the story. Some people may also find the series a bit slow at times, but I think the slow pace in these moments is warranted since its usage serves the purpose of getting us to think about the consequences of what we are observing. This was also done wonderfully in the masterpiece ""Grave of the Fireflies"".

I believe that this is a must see for anime fans, since you will find a whole array of new and interesting concepts being used. To those not familiar with the genre, I would recommend that you watch this series only if you do not mind complex plots and at times slow progress of the action.",1132012800,14,2606,4.55982905982906
1385141,5,B00005094P,"Let me begin by saying this.  If you don't like thought-provoking, disturbing series with little to no violence, you should not buy this.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Now, for those who are not instantly shying away at the thought of thinking for a bit, read on.

Lain is a deep, perturbing thriller.  The first scene shows a girl jump from a building, as onlookers see her fall to her death on the street.  This is the most violent the series gets, save for another suicide or two later on.

The disturbing part comes when the protagonist Lain discovers an e-mail from the jumper.  The story involves the ability to live in the Wired (internet basically), without having to have a body in reality, and how closely the two worlds are connected.

For anyone who enjoys a good ""thinking-man's"" series, Lain will provide everything you're looking for in spades.  If you're looking for action, apply somewhere else.  This series, though, proves that violence isn't necessary to make a series memorable and enjoyable.",1122508800,7,1014,4.7701149425287355

1385143,1,B00005094P,"About half way through this series, one of the characters reacts to something handed her by a stranger, saying ""What in the world?......Some sort of bad joke.""

Which, ironically enough, perfectly sums-up Serial Experiments Lain.  It's the ""Artistic, stunning Anime"" that's actually uninteresting, slow, self-important melodrama.

And what's with all the grunting, huffing and sighing.....and 2 minute ""terror"" scenes where we're forced to listen to bad voice actors make-up ""OMG, I'M SO SCARED"" noises that no human being would ever utter without laughing at themselves.  Even when running for their life.

All in all, I think most positive reviewers are mistaking ""Artistic"" with ""Very poor writing of a semi-interesting story"".

The author blissfully jumps from Plot-Point A to Plot-Point B without so much as faking even an implausible deus ex machina:  here we are, forced to watch another 5 minutes of Mopey-Dopey Lain ""artistically"" trudge down the sidewalk, grunting to herself while staring at transmission lines for the umpteenth time and then BAM!....she's Johnny-On-The-Spot Lain, diligently hunting down The Professor for absolutely no logical reason at all.

I especially liked when Lain's ""Dad"" pops his head into her room and is just as surprised as we are to see it chalk-full of hardcore computer equipment:  how'd this 8th grade girl get a 747 cargo jet's worth of mainframe into her room without ""Dad"" noticing her dragging the crap up the stairs.  I mean, what did she do with the boxes and packing material?  Eat it?  And where the heck did she get the cash for it all?  There's a hundred thousand dollars worth of computer crap in there.  Is she selling Amway on the side?

The Lain series turns out to be incredible to the extent that virtually every minute of it is annoying in one way or another.  Here's a suggestion if you decide to buy it: watch it in the language you don't understand.  If you understand Japanese, watch it in English.  If you know English, watch it in Japanese.  As long as you don't understand the words, there's a chance your mind will ignore the terrible writing and manufacture a decent story.

Heck...watch it with the sound off:  then not only will you make up a better story, you won't have to listen to all the obnoxious grunting and puffing.",1119657600,7,2298,4.947780678851175
1385144,5,B00005094P,"Lain is a very trippy and mellow experience.  Unlike some animes that try their hardest to keep you on the edge of your seat and crapping bullets, this one keeps you rather interested mentally.  The imagery is fantastic.  It has a very artsy feel to it and it follows a very ""art film"" direction.  Kind of episodic and non-narrative here and there.

The openning song is sweet and some of the music is just great.  Of course, the closing song is a little on the poor side of things, but, it doesn't matter!

""Lain"" is full of some great characters and some crazy ideas.  It is funny to see how the girl Lain progresses through the series.  The last two episodes are full of madness and it is just an anime full of cyber-oddness.  Has a little bit of a ""Matrix"" feel to it but in a very non-straightforward sort of way.

I found it intriguing and wanting to put in each DVD one after another and watch all in one sitting.

For those saying the price is too high, and to buy the cheap two disc set:  You do realize those are good looking bootlegs right?  If you want the real thing, pay for the real thing.  Everyone has to make money, and it's not cheap to import.  You have to do the whole move/show all over again with voice actors and packaging.

I only bring it up, because if everyone went for the illegal copies, we'd see a lot less of the good authentic stuff coming over, and as it is there is only a small fraction of what has been made coming over to the US.  I have to frequently import my favorite shows from a Japanese retailer because I know there is no way it's going to look financially viable to a US company to distribute it here.

From the beggining with the opening song, i got hooked. Lain is a series that the best thing it has is the fact that you can see it a 1000 times and always ends with another conclusion.

Some many people maybe hate this, but is the same feeling that I got when I saw for the first time Evangelion, most people have too many conclusions. The best of all it doesn't have cliche's (well I didn't see any)and I loved it.

Recently i got the box set and used it for a report...got the best grade of my class. The next day...half of the class asked for a ""Lain Movie Marathon"". And I mean a High School.

Lain is a great example of how extreme Japanese anime can be. The plot does make some sense, but very obscure. Times to times you will feel that the creator cheats on you by giving you incomprehensible explanation that maybe even himself does not understand. However, in term of artistic view, I must give Lain 5/5. The creativity in this anime is truly amazing, the grayish tone colors are beautiful and sound effects are great.

If you're looking for visual and aural satisfactions, Lain is truly a must see.",1102204800,7,546,4.677083333333333
1385150,5,B00005094P,"Lain is something that truly engrosses the viewer, steals there mind, throws it into the washing machine, gives it to the dog as a chew toy then, shoots it back into their head for the three point shot of absolute confusion. This series is for anyone willing to take a deeper look into someone elses views on life, relationships, reality, and existence. When you first watch this show you'll completely have no idea of what's going on, but that's the point in my opinion. Every detail in the first few episodes is later either explained or provides as a reason for what may currently be going on in the series at that moment. Also it holds an important view about communication and understanding others. After finishing this show you'll possibly feel the need to cry without knowing why. More so the desire to know and understand the meaning of this series will have you pondering  for hours if you didn't get it all the first time - I know I did -. Also if you pay attention the age old proverb of too much knowledge leads to sorrow may come into play.

When it comes to the animation of this story it is simply beautiful. The characters are purely amazing and so true to life. -My personal favorite is Alice who seems to pose the classic portrayl of Ophelia, and someone you can truly connect with- Also the evolution of Lains expanding interest in the wired ( internet ) is profound. I only wathced the dubbed version , but the voice acting is really good. The music for this show is perhaps one of the best parts of this show. It gives one a psycadelic feeling as well as a homey and warm one.

There's so much more I can say about this show, but in all honesty it is up to the viewer her/himself to decipher the meaning of this tale, and establish their own ideas of the two worlds and what it means to connect without devices. If you're looking to be spellbound beyond belief then you should get Serial Experiments Lain, it's one that will never leave the depths of your psyche.

1385151,5,B00005094P,"I suppose that technically Lain is ""shojo"" (Japanese for ""girl""), but to use such a restrictive term to describe a work as profound as this seems tragically dishonest. Lain is NOT Sailor Moon, and in truth occupies a very different genre, at least in my mind. Most importantly, Lain does not seem aimed at kids at all. Most kids, boys or girls, probably don't want to know the answers to the questions Lain asks. At least, not just yet. Some even classify Lain as ""horror"", which is not a stretch -- some disturbing themes and imagery are blended into the work.

Sure, Lain is cute, could be thought of as a typical ""magic girl"" so common in anime and she is definitely beautifully drawn (Lain screencaps are some of the best art I own), but it is her incredibly complex personality that will steal your heart, not her oversized eyes and undersized mouth. Beautiful female anime characters are a dime a dozen, but in a world full of them, Lain is truly unique.

Just as anime for boys can be about more than the bang-pow glorification of metamorphosizing robots, superheroes with giant swords and marketing toys and video games, anime for girls can transcend the cloying sentimentalism of general teen angst, the jocular cruelty of childhood society and the joyous heartbreak of young romance, which is what Lain most assuredly does. Lain is shojo in name only.

Indeed, to think of Lain as being about a young Japanese schoolgirl is to confuse the story with its backdrop. Lain is not like other girls. While this is hardly unusual -- stories about girls invariably paint their heroines as unique and special, as every girl ultimately is -- in the case of Lain, it's the understatement of the century. As best can be determined, Lain is not human at all. But we can't really know, and the way this uncertainty is maintained adds to Lain's durability as a mainstay of my anime collection.

Serial Experiments: Lain would stand up quite nicely as the core of a college philosophy class at either the undergraduate or graduate level. It's that deep. I can also say, without a moment's hesitation, that Lain presents one of the most intriguing and engaging examinations of epistemology and cognition I have ever seen in any medium, whether anime, movie, television or even print.

As others have pointed out, the seminal themes of Lain are not necessarily new to anime, or to storytelling in general. Any meaningful work of art addresses them in some way or another, and I would hazard to say that much of what we think of as making art meaningful derives from how well we think it has addressed these themes.

Ultimately, Lain is Lain. To even hope to understand more than that, it is necessary to come to the Wired.

It's very stylized and, well, experimental; about twenty percent of the first group of episodes consists of outdoor shots in which most of the background is whited out, and the only sound is the quietly menacing hum of power lines. Moments like these are very effective. I think the series is at its best when it's not trying very hard. The sense of foreboding and existential crisis is much more effectively communicated by the subtly wrong behavior of the characters, by the minor overheard conversations and the held static scenes, than it is by the moments when a disembodied voice asks the same ambiguous question over and over. Lain deals with themes which are somewhat overhashed (who am I? what am I? where do I end and you begin? what is the difference between the phenomenon as it exists and is experienced?), more now than ever, and its take on these themes isn't all that fresh. Its style, though, is incredible.",1083974400,,1066,4.798913043478261
1385155,5,B00005094P,"How do I even begin reviewing a show like ""Serial Experiments: Lain?""
To start with, this is one of the most visually amazing, compelling, twisted, sci-fi-ish, dramatic, different and confusing anime series I've ever seen. It all centers on Lain, who, in all respects, appears to be a normal, if not independent (read: loner) young girl. She doesn't have super powers, she isn't anime-style sexy, and she doesn't own or operate a giant mecha -- but she does wear the cutest little teddy bear outfit: ears, tail, and all.
The story begins with the suicide of one of her classmates. A short time later, she's emailed by this classmate, from ""beyond the dead..."" Lain, having likely never powered on her Navi (think future, voice activated Macintosh -- it even run's the ""Copland OS""), clears off her desk and sets the machine up. And she's hooked. She asks her ""Papa"" for a new Navi, as her's is a little old and dated. With her wish granted, she's soon cruz'ing the Wired (the future Internet) in her brand new Navi. By chance (or is it?) she comes into posession of a Psyche Processor, and reads up on how to install it. That Processor is only the beginning, and soon her room is transformed into a dark cave of twisted wires and green, bubbling coolant.
The series, like I said, is confusing. If you had a hard time with ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" you might pass on ""Lain."" It's difficult to review, because of everything that happens in it. True, there are only 13 episodes, but those episodes contain so much story line, that missing one is like missing two hours of a movie that's two hours and ten minutes long. Only until the last disc makes it into your DVD player do you begin to understand some of what's going on. And then, the story line changes on you again, and you're once again thinking, ""Huh?""
If you've never seen ""Lain,"" I wouldn't recommend this box set. I also can't recommend the purchase of just the first disc to ""try it out,"" as the good, confusing stuff doesn't start happening until the next disc's episodes. You might want to try a rental store or friend, to give it a test drive. If you already own all the DVD's, there's really no reason to buy this box set, as all you'd be getting is a box (and, of course, a second copy of each DVD).
Repeated viewings of ""Lain"" are recommended. Personally, I think a little ""viewer companion"" for us American audiences would have been a nice touch. ""Serial Experiments: Lain"" should be watched by all anime fans, as it provides a different approach to anime, but some may come away feeling lost and dazed. Lain will do that to you.",1081728000,11,2588,4.54389721627409
1385156,5,B00005094P,"Watching this anime reminds me of the movie The Matrix.  The interesting thing is that both films were released in the year 1999.  Lain was released in July whilst The Matrix was released in March.  Lain was released 4 months later than The Matrix and this might give one a feeling that Lain might have copied the idea from The Matrix.
Although both Lain and The Matrix play around with the concept of existence, the ending of the Lain series is more consistent or at least more pseudo-logical than the Matrix series.
The funny thing is that the Lain series ended in September 1999 but the Matrix series ended in 2003.  This might give one an impression that The Matrix Revolution had borrowed an idea from Lain - the idea of having the cyber power to affect real world events.
However, Lain is more consistent in the concept of existence as Lain sticks to the argument that our existance is based on the minds and the link between minds or memories.  In contrary, the explaination of how Neo can do that stunt of electric zap through the mouth Oracle in the Matrix Revolution is simply ridiculous.
Anyway, the fist time watching Lain may confuse the viewer to a certain degree as watching the anime ""Perfect Blue"", but at the end both Lain and Perfect Blue still make more sense than the ending of the Matrix series.
Be warned, Lain may give one a headache as the Matrix does but Lain does not have the medicine of action to sooth one's headache.

Nearly every review gives above four or five stars. Well what you people say is true, it is a great animae that opens our eyes to a place where we haven't been before. Sadly according to me, this animae only targets a one audience, a audience that seeks deep dark story line. a Difficult to understand story and makers of this movie ONLY targets that audience and they have completely forgotten about the audience that watches a animae for a good story line and a more colorful work and bit of action. thats a one sad thing about this, Thats what led me down, actually i am a kind of person who looks for a Animae with a balance, deep story line is good but bit of more colors and bit of action do makes me feel good in the end. so i could only give 3 stars because rest of the stars goes for the colors and graphics and action what so ever. I like the movie ""Perfect Blue"" it had a psychological plot + nice work and some bit of action. I hope you people get what i mean,
Go for this movie if you are 100% sure that you are a person who seeks a deeper darker twisting, confusing story line. You care nothing else but that,
But if you are a person who is looking for stuff like Wicked City, Ninja Scrolls, watch out because you are going to be disapointed.
I also do not recommend this to people who are looking for a nicely balanced animation, coz believe me you guys gonna get bored with this.

Sadly according to me, this animae only targets a one audience, a audience that seeks deep dark story line. a Difficult to understand story and makers of this movie ONLY targets that audience and they have completely forgotten about the audience that watches a animae for a good story line and a more colorful work and bit of action. thats a one sad thing about this, Thats what led me down, actually i am a kind of person who looks for a Animae with a balance, deep story line is good but bit of more colors and bit of action do makes me feel good in the end. so i could only give 3 stars because other rest of stars goes for the colors and graphics and action what so ever. I like the movie ""Perfect Blue"" it had a psychological plot + nice work and some bit of action. I hope you people get what i mean,
Go for this movie if you are 100% sure that you are a person who seeks a deeper darker twisting, confusing story line. You care nothing else but that,
But if you are a person who is looking for stuff like Wicked City, Ninja Scrolls, watch out because you are going to be disapointed.
I also do not recommend this to people who are looking for a nicely balanced animation, coz believe me you guys gonna get bored with this.
Story rockz and thats it, nothing else. just very close face shots and large eyes, simple drawn characters, same kind of Opening through out all the episodes.
This should have been a real good one if they target all sorts of audiences.",1078876800,,1806,4.207492795389049

The girls here are drawn as rather ordinary flat-chested 13 year olds, not as big-boobed hotties, and the action here is as much psychological as physical (though within the first three episodes at least four people die horrible and gruesome deaths so it is not completely action-free).
However: if you want a thoughtful story line that does not insult your intelligence, you will like Lain. The impressionistic artwork vividly complements the surreal plot line in a way that could not be done with live action even with today's CGI. In a way, Lain is a good example of a television series that could only be done as anime', though as others point out, David Lynch and others have managed to duplicate the creepy atmosphere in live action (albeit without the psychedelic artwork).",1075680000,10,967,4.761904761904762

This is a very slow paced anime that is completely story driven.  So if that's not going to be enought to hold you interest then don't waste your time.  No action to speak of, no sex and no violence.  I know this will detract a good portion of you from seeing it now that I said that.  The only reason that I sat through the entire series was because of the fact that the story was enough to get me through it.

Her father, a computer programmer, is her introduction to the ""wired"" - a much more powerful form of the internet of today.  As she gets more in more envolved with the wired, she becomes less and less a part of the real world.

1385169,5,B00005094P,"In the world of anime, for many people, Serial Experiments Lain holds the title as the most disturbing, most convaluted series of all time.
Quite frankly, I agree with them.
But there is also more to S. E. Lain than its mere ""freakish-ness."" Lain, like its fellow notoriously controversial self-analytical anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, makes a point of taking typically over-played, over-used philisophical concepts and questions posed in many darker, psycho-analytical animes, and proposing them in a new light. Lain's analysis of the human condition and of human nature through the characters of the series is truly deserving of praise as well. As a matter of fact, when one watches Lain, they may get the feeling that the characters hold a purpose less as characters, and more plot devices used to embody and demonstrate the questions and concepts proposed by the series (as is especially evident with the character Alice/Arisu), as do many of the events that occur throughout the series as well. This is not neccessarily a bad thing, in that S. E. Lain is more a concept/analysis based than a plot based one. Yet, even in all of the ""psycho-babble"" that Lain is based on, the series sets itself apart from other animes in that it does not attempt to act as if it can truly answer all of the questions that it itself poses; as if there is some sort of absolute truth that everyone is bound by. All in all, the entire story serves as a metaphor. What that metaphor is, you must decide for yourself.
I would recommend watching the Neon Genesis Evangelion series before watching Lain, as the two share many common concepts, and having watched Evangelion adds a bit more intrigue to watching the series. In the end, Serial Experiments Lain is one ot those love-it-or-hate-it animes. Personally, I loved it. It's also one that you appreciate more and more every time you watch it over again. And you WILL end up watching it a good number of times before you can finally put it down. Trust me.",1073347200,19,1992,4.776811594202899
1385170,5,B00005094P,"Serial experiments lain is forsure my favorite anime of all time. I rented this whole serise with my friend ad we stayed up all weekend and watched the whole thing,..  we watched it on about 7 TVs piled up in a piramid i might add,.. it is very annoying to watch that many TVs at once when your tired.
anyway back to the review
COLOUR- the colour code of this anime was great and well done, i didn't notice a flaw once in the colour code.
ANIMATION- the animation of the characters and other events was outstanding, there wasn't as much frame looping (the same clip repeated to illistrate hair blowing in the wind etc.) as there was in other animes, everything was in extreamly high detail including the eyes, the artist even went through the trouble of giving the eyes a realistic aperance, instead of the traditional anime eyes.
STORY LINE- the storyline is exquisite, you get right into the anime from the first episode, it seems to explain itself at the beginning but as the plot advances it becomes utterly confusing untill the plot is wraped up at the end and all your questions are answered. The storyline was extreamly unpredictable, its almost like something from the x-files meets the matrix.... its awsome
SOUND EFFECTS/FILLERS- all of the sound efects were extreamly well done and very very realistic,..  if you get the chance to watch this anime on a high definition stereo system or dolby 5.1 by all means do it, it adds to the experiance.
DUB- now this is new,.. i usualy never rate the dub, but the SE Lain dub was done so well, i usualy watch my anime DVDs with the origional japanese audio and english subtitles, i seem to perfer the origional audio. But i enjoyed watching the english dub. It was perfect, almost like it was origionaly intended to be in english. when i compared the origional audio to the english dub, the english and japanese voice overs were almost identical,.. the voices were almost the same.
OVER ALL- this anime has had much time put into it and it shows, although i wish it were longer than 13 episodes, but belive me, watch it you won't be dissapointed.....",1071446400,5,2101,4.585106382978723

1385173,5,B00005094P,"'Lain-Serial Experiments' starts with the simple question-""What are you?""  Seemingly innocent enough at first, this beautiful little story about an highly introverted, almost autistic young Japanese girl-Lain Iwakura-soon moves into a sinister labyrinth where the viewer is often unsure where or what the story is about.
The basic themes of the story revolve around traditional philosophical problems, such as the nature of personal identity, the existence of God, the nature of time, the nature of being, the fundamental nature of the universe, 'appearance vs reality', the evolution of man in the universe, and the nature of history. Set in a super-high tech Japan, about 20-30 years into the future, everyone and everything are connected by a souped-up successor to the internet known simply as the 'Wired', which is accessed both via computers called 'Navis' and also by direct wireless connection.  The Wired, however, soon seems to become something a lot more sinister and powerful than a mere super-powerful information network.
Lain, her family and friends, and her world seem perfectly normal and innocuous at first; this atmosphere is beautifully established via the depiction of Lain's morning routine before going to school; it must be seen to be understood, but it is the perfect image of what a bourgoise Japanese family must be like in reality.  However, things begin to go awry when a mysterious email from a dead girl who committed suicide-Chisa Yamamoda-is received by Lain and her friends with the simple message 'You no longer need bodies.'
Lain checks her mail and soon begins to explore the Wired, seeming to plunge into ever darker and seedier places; sleazy chatrooms, violent gaming parlours, and underground hacking hangouts, and along the way she soon runs into increasingly dubious and dangerous characters.  Soon strange looking men in suits turn up outside her house and watch her through laser-guided eyepieces, and she begins to experience strange visions and hallucinations which appear to undermine the reality of the world around her.  Even more strangely, paralell selves begin to appear and start doing horrible things, from selling drug-like nanotechnology to revealing her best-friend's sexual secrets to the entire school.
Behind these sinister developments seem to be two organisations-Tachibana General Labs and a group deemed simply ""The Knights', a secret society apparently bent on manipulating humankind's 'collective unconcious', a sort of storehouse of all the memories and information mankind has collected over his 3 or so billion years of evolution, and a rogue scientist called Muatsama Eri, who has dark plans of his own for Lain.
The plot only seems to thicken when Eri's far-sighted ideas about artificial intelligence, information theory, communications science, and human biology mixed with queer utopian fantasies of transcendance and perfection are unveiled, within which Lain appears to play an integral role.  The resolution of the story, which I won't reveal, is paradoxically open yet final, and leaves one with a sense of emptiness, sadness and self-satisfaction at the same time.  The basic message appears to be that we can become whatever we want to, and do whatever we want to, provided we know who we really are underneath appearances.
For better or worse, 'Lain' explores these ideas using the non-traditional aesthetic of postmodernism, rather than the linear, simple style narrative one sees in other animes.  The postmodern aesthetic means that the story of Lain is told in a highly fragmented, non-linear manner, often jumping back and forth between perspectives, images, dialogue and even colour and sound, with each artistic element being related to another in multiple rather than single ways, which at first is very confusing; the series really has to be watched several times before it 'hangs together.'
In closing, it can be said that 'Lain' certainly makes one think and the questions it raises are highly topical to today's world, and to the world of the near future.  Is the ultimate reality behind we and the world made of information that is connected together in various ways?  Can minds exist anywhere, no matter what the 'substrate' is?  Does history really define one's existence totally, and can changing the information and structure of stored information wipe history out altogether?  Are we really made of a Cartesian 'I', or a plural of selves shared by all minds, living and dead?  Can we evolve by ourselves, or is there really a being one might call 'God' behind it all?  How will technology and the increased sharing of information change our lives, memories, and even who were are?  In an age when information is increasingly connected and shared, and history can be manipulated in more ways than ever before, Lain makes one think harder about these things than ever before.",1058572800,7,4873,5.2535392535392536
1385174,5,B00005094P,"Lain is by far one of my favorite animes of all time. The story is deep, well thought out, and very entertaining throughout. The characters develop perfectly, the atmosphere is incredible, and the story is flawless. Some of the story is left slightly open ended, leaving the viewer to fill in his or her own conclusions.
Tech heads will relate to this story effortlessly. The Wired is easily a souped up version of our own Internet, and the history isn't outrageously far from our own and well explained. The parallels between our world and this fictional world really make things interesting. This series really hits a sweet spot for sci-fi technological dramas.
Every anime fan should see this series, but be prepared for a brain twister. I've watched it a good five times and I can honestly say I still find new tidbits of the story every time. You just can't sit back and put your brain on cruise control; You must make an effort to follow the story or it will leave you mercilessly lost and confused.
And remember folks, this is fiction. You have to be willing to suspend belief a few times and accept the universe of the work at hand. Those unwilling or unable to do this, need not apply. Think of it as a deep mystery novel. Even when following the concrete parts of the story with great attention, there's enough misdirection to leave you wondering what if... and that's half the fun.
If you simply can't accept that the story isn't handed to you neatly gift wrapped, and that you may have to fill in the details from your own imagination, then go watch a simpler anime. This isn't for you. If you like the confusing story of animes like Neon Genesis Evangelion, or Boogiepop Phantom then you'll love this. If you live and breath technology, you'll only love it that much more. All in all, this is a masterpiece of animation.

1385175,5,B00005094P,"This series is proof (if such was ever needed) that Japanese anime is far more than cartoon entertainment.  It is a tightly worked study of innocence lost and the inherent destructiveness of the virtual 'wired' mindset.  Using the story of Lain, a girl on the verge of womanhood, the series follows her 'adventures' in a Wonderland gone amok.  Not so much a coming of age story as a warning that too much knowledge can be poisonous.
When we meet Lain she is a computer ingnue, uncomfortable even using her Navi to talk to friends.  Gradually Lain and the world within the computer become enmeshed.  Almost without here awareness, her online persona takes on a style of its own - louder, more cynical, possible even evil.  Lain finds that she is not sure which personality she really is, assuming that she is either one.  The series spins layer upon layer, until the viewer is no more positive than is Lain.
I am not going to dig any further into the plot, since I have reviewed the individual DVDs elsewhere.  But I can promise that the story is both predictable and unpredictable.  A tragic whimsy where final nirvana is played in somber tones.  An extraordinary essay in the visual arts.
The artwork and music for this series are as exceptional as the story.  Visual and aural clues abound on a symbol-ridden landscape.  Stylistically it uses static backgrounds with foreground animation to present a continually graphic effect.  Both the progression of scenes and the images presented are complex, demanding viewer attention.
Lain has had a cult following for some time (it won the excellence prize in Japan's 1998 Media Art Festival) but has come to US audiences slowly.  This is a beautiful, experimental piece of film work.  If that interests you than you will no doubt want the whole series.  And the set is the best and most economic way way to accomplish that.",1054684800,13,1869,4.775700934579439
1385195,5,B00005094P,"Unlike much of the anime that makes it's way to the US, and then into American fanboi culture, Lain is not accessible to most of the worlds average viewers.
Lain is sometimes dark and brooding, and at other times excited and rushed.  I believe it is meant to represent the division in Lains mind. What is she? Who is she? Who is God?  These questions are all important, and are all answered.. sort of.  We're left with a sense of fulfillment, when all is said and done, but also a sense of mystery.  Nobody knows exactly what is going on, a statement to the state of the world, and perhaps more importantly.. nobody should.  Power corrupts.
Definitely a must see, but only after you begin to understand the methods that Anime employs to carry it's points. Unlike live action film, Anime has the ability to show things in the way the creator actually wants the things to be shown, so one doesn't have to imagine much going on.  Characters are also inflated in some sense, to make up for the inherent inability to document every single movement and inflection that a person is capable of.
Fantastic over-all, though perhaps not meant for the casual viewer.",1053993600,6,1154,4.6048780487804875
1385196,5,B00005094P,"Back, back, back in ancient times, the captivating Sphinx posed Oedipus her famous riddle: what has four legs in the morning, two legs in the midday sun, and three legs in the evening?  Of course, the answer is a human being.  While this riddle has unfortunately become somewhat of a clich, the Sphinx implicitly presented a question that has been at the heart of Greek and modern philosophy: What is a man?  In these later stages of the world's history, questions such as ""When is a man not a man?"" and ""What makes a man a man?"" have yet to be satisfactorily answered; in the end, the Sphinx may have the last laugh.  Arguably, these basic questions of human identity have become even more imperative given new developments in technology and artificial intelligence.  ""Serial Experiments Lain"" courageously and humbly dares to weigh in on these crucial and complex issues.
What is most fascinating about ""Lain"" is how it approaches the conception the ""self.""  Our first glance of Lain occurs in an overexposed scene flushed with light: she opens the door to her house and tentatively steps onto her porch and down a flight of stairs.  The series progresses from a Lain who is withdrawn and insular to a Lain who embarks on a terrifying odyssey into the Wired, a futuristic and more encompassing incarnation of our Inter Web.  As she integrates herself further and further into the Wired, her identity begins to splinter.  Nakamura provocatively invites us to explore the nature of the ""self:"" is Lain still Lain even if she only exists in fragments?
A byzantine and labyrinthine narration accompanies and mimics Lain's faltering sense of self.  It immerses the viewer in a world of violence, danger, possibility, seclusion, and thinly veiled sexual tides.  Japanese society and the geographical island of Japan itself create a particularly adept ambience for this series of intense schizophrenic realism:  Japan is a nation of gross arrogance and abject humility; a culture that fosters both a collective mentality but can spawns morbid introverts, and a society that is overflowing with information (or more precisely ""infonography"") but has been stricken by collective amnesia for the last fifty years.  Its landmass is small and claustrophobic while providing more than enough aesthetic and conceptual area for terrifying hidden worlds and lonely paradises.
The Anime world has recently witnessed a plethora of series that deal with these hidden worlds with a distinct emphasis on visions of the apocalypse.  ""Lain"" is no different.  The most immediate example of mass obliteration is ""End of Evangelion.""  Many have accused ""Lain"" of plagiarizing ""EoE's"" central themes.  Some of the criticism is well founded, but ""Lain"" is far from a slavish imitator of ""EoE's"" prophecy of a devastated wasteland: ""Lain"" delivers a much more optimistic verdict of humanity's future.  Whereas Hideaki Anno's pessimism robs us of any possibility of renewal within our time, ""Lain"" contends that the Self is a protean and enduring being capable of escaping annihilation.  Ryutaro Nakamura suggests that salvation lies in simple displays of kindness and empathy, acts that give Lain the faith to pursue the terrifying truth of her identity and the power to dispel the false gods.  In the end, expressions of compassion and humanity may be the true measure of a person.  It may just be what makes a human a human.",1051488000,6,3399,5.077338129496403
1385197,5,B00005094P,"Let me start off by saying that the animation and imagery of Lain is absolutly stunning. However, Lain is not for everyone.
I'll be honest, this series, or movie, starts off making very little sense. However, as the ""layers"" build a story really begins to form. This is definately the sort of anime that you need to watch several times to really comprehend, however once you do you'll find that Lain is deeper than than it seems at first glance. In the first viewing you'll be lucky to really scratch the surface of the real story of whats going on in Lain's world.
If you like a story that is strait forward, told in order and always from the same point of view, then Lain is not for you. If you like a solid and conclusive ending that brings closure to the story, then Lain is not for you. However, if you like beutifully animated anime that is presented in a very psychological and fractured way with a story and ending that is thought provoking, then Lain IS for you.

I can only suggest to everyone: WATCH IT! Trust me you won't regret it. And open your mind and find the words between the lines.
It is right that this is not an action movie and this is also not how it was ment to be. But this 'opus' will keep you in front of the screen until you have watched all 'layers'. It's misty atmosphere will never loose its excitment to see what happens next. Don't worry if you don't understand a scene immediately, you can be sure it will be shown later from a different point of view and you will learn to understand.
If I could, I would definately nominate 'Serial Experiments Lain' for an Oscar. And this is really not a joke.
In my oppinion its really the best movie ever. Just think of a mixture of the atmosphere in ""Odysse 2001"", the science fiction of ""Matrix"", the deepness of a drama.. combined in one 'momentum'.

However, visuals alone do not create the mind-altering masterpiece which is Lain; yet they are a good foundation. It is the sense of reality that is warped by the storyline and redirected to the viewer that has the most impact on the mind and that makes it most memorable. The story of Lain also holds subtle truths behind it, and the fact that these truths are twisted into becoming almost obscure, yet still remain true, gives off a feeling of uneasiness to whoever happens to be watching it.
One thing is for sure: that Lain should not be held to any classifications or standards previously set. In fact, I don't believe that it should be considered ""anime"" beyond the fact that it is animated. I would recommend this series to anyone wanting another possible outlook on the world around them.
The show attempts, not to answer, but to broaden many questions that we as people ask ourselves, ranging from ""Why are we here"", to ""Who (or what) is God?"" It leads us to ponder them a little more than we would have otherwise.

I wasn't sure whether I liked Evangelion the first time through, but I watched it again, and it became much better, watched it again, and it got better yet again.  Everytime it got better.
Well, I watched Lain for the first, and thought it was the stupidest piece of garbage I had ever seen.  But I thought I'd give it a second chance, and still had no appreciation for it.  It was by far the worst anime series I had ever seen.  I thought I must be missing something, as I just couldn't comprehend anime being that bad, so I watched it one more time.  And it just got worse.
First and foremost, the animation in this series is horrendous.  I know it's supposed to be artistic and meaningful and make the viewer see the world in a different way or whatever, but it just doesn't.  The animation is boring and looks unfinished, and it makes the series very hard to watch.
Beyond the animation, the plot is boring, and not nearly as thought provoking as so many people think it is.  The series moves along far too slowly, rarely does anything happen.  There are entire episodes that could be left out and the only difference I would notice would be the shorter running time.  The series is not philosophical in anyway.  It tries to rip off concepts from other series (Evangelion for one), and approach them from a different light, but it only does that: approach the concept.  Never does it actually fully discuss or deal with the different concepts.
I would reccomend someone looking for a thought provoking series to just watch Evangelion again, or if you are looking for something different and artistic, check out Boogiepop Phantom, which bares many similarities to Lain, but is done much better.  The only redeeming quality of the series is that it comes in an exceptionally pretty box.",1042848000,16,1948,4.592485549132948
1385205,5,B00005094P,"I happened upon Lain one day in a local comics store that rents anime and I was immediately drawn to the series by the art of the cover. Instead of your usual beautiful anime girl, Lain wasn't classically beautiful or sexy. Instead, she seemed sad, haunted almost. I rented the series and soon fell in love with it. I knew then, I had to buy the series.
Admitingly, this series can be confusing at times, but that's part of its appeal. On one hand, the plot seems simple; an introverted girl finds her way to the 'wired' and as she travels through this world, the lines between reality and imaginary began to blur. Sometimes, you find yourself not knowing whether what you are seeing is real or if you're just caught up in one of Lain's illusions.
I have seen the series about 5 times now and I still don't claim to understand all of it. Yet, every time I watch I find myself stumbling upon some idea I hadn't thought of previously. While Lain's main theme is that of reality within the 'wired' world, this series manages to question all basic human beliefs about life, death, religion, evolution, existance, etc. One second a character will make a statement that you'll immediately think is wrong but in the next second they'll say something you accept as a universal truth. The best way to watch this series is not trying to understand ever triviality, but journey with the characters as they search for the truth, yet it is up to the viewer to decide what this truth is.
To summarize, Lain is a beautiful, haunting series that asks everything yet explains little. It doesn't have a nice tight ending where all lose ends are tied up, but that would have ruined the series itself.",1041206400,4,1681,4.551155115511551

Lain explores deeply integrated hopes and fears for the hyper-connected future, where the electronic realm of 'infornography' not only contextualizes our existence, but defines and becomes our very reality. Lain is no one; Lain is everyone; Lain is God; Lain is any one of us who, because we can no longer control or accept our reality, makes the conscious decision to alter it. Anyone who enjoys broadening their intellectual horizons will surely savour this trip.",1038182400,,589,4.959595959595959

1385208,5,B00005094P,"Take it out of the Anime genre, take it for it's worth.  This series is definately complex and bizarre, but also one of the most intriguing and thought provoking pieces ever assembled.  With beautiful imagery that sometimes would go from epic to downright trippie.  ""Lain"" was so superb visually, not simply because the animation was fabricated in such a high standard, but because it was combined together in such a perfect state.  The soundtrack also accented the series in golden form, the sounds linear to every scene, some sounds nothing more than hums, but still sharp in your mind.  Above all, the storyline anchored the whole series, as you go from episode to episode you seem to learn more of the plot and at the same time get a little more confused.  You really can't say enough of the writing of this series, really a great marvel.  Definately for those with a very open mind, since the major theme of the series is in fact our very existance.  The existance of our being physically and even the very fabric and importance of our memories.  I guess you can also call this a character piece.  I really took an interest in Lain, who was this young girl so bland and emotionless and at the same time so human.  It's really hard to explain, but in some odd way, I related to her more than any of the ""normal"" characters in the series.
Not really a pick-up for your average Anime fan.  Recommended to those that are serious film and related media spectators.  Very similiar at times to even a David Lynch film, with great under-lays of the plot and a heavy message.  Very much a challenging viewing, very serious, and at times very bizarre.  Probably a perfect fit for Lynch and Kubrick fans, even Bergman or Fellini fans will probably enjoy.  Anime fans that enjoyed the plots of ""Jin-roh"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"" will probably enjoy this series as well.",1034553600,7,1862,4.596969696969697

If that doesn't work for you, how about the opening sound of each episode: ""Present time.. heh .. Present day... hah hah hah""
LAIN, or rather Serial Experiments Lain, is a series that takes your brain out of your head, slaps it around a bit, and then rolls it through one of those playdo noodle machines.
Being un-spoil-giving as I am, the series focuses around Lain, a young girl who just wants to lead an ordinary life.  In the first episode, one of her friends commits suicide; somehow, though, people start receiving e-mail from her, claiming that she is still alive but just gave up her body.  From this point forward, Lain struggles to define reality, the world she knows, with the Wired.  She finds that the two are not as different as she would like.
The animation is unique, reminding me more of ""old school"" anime than more current styles.  The quality of the dubs and subs are both good, thanks to Pioneer (they usually do a good job on both, which is rare).  And that opening song will, and I mean will, get stuck in your head.
Getting back to the plot, the world of the Wired is an internet-like network that contains all the information there ever was; through the series, you (and Lain) learn how humanity interacts with this network, the origins of some technolgies that exist, and that Lain is already known throughout the Wired before she even owns her first computer.
Whether you're like a friend of mine and like to get really zoned out by this type of anime or you just want to watch a real mind-bender, this is a series for you.  If you're looking for a more casual, comedic style or something with more action and less plot, I wouldn't recommend sitting down for this one.  Whatever you do, I urge you all to draw your own conclusions about this one - don't borrow anyone else's or trust other opinions - they will only harm your ability to take away understanding from this series because you will have pre-formed ideas.
Excellent quality and plot make this one worth 5 stars.",1032998400,,2030,4.530054644808743

1385214,5,B00005094P,"Lain is a very strange breed for an anime series; it's not the kind of story that will appeal to most mainstream anime people.  Some people I have talked to say that if you are an intellectual then you will enjoy Lain but I don't think that this is necessarily true.  This is anime that makes you think, but it is also the kind of anime that demands a certain amount of participation from the watcher.  You must be willing to totally immerse yourself into the series else you will find it boring and slow paced regardless of how smart you may be.
For those that can make the commitment, Lain offers up a real treat.  Eschewing traditional anime themes, every shot in Lain is thought out with a meticulousness that any film student will go nuts for.  The visuals are absolutely captivating and the story offers more twists then I can honestly remember.  There will be times when you are watching it that you think you have everything figured out only to have another huge plot twist dropped on you with all you misconceptions being thrown out the window.
This is cerebral stuff to be sure and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of 16 (and I'm being really generous here) but for those that can appreciate it, you're in for quite a ride.  Lain isn't the kind of anime you want to watch alone either; after each major turn you'll be hungering for someone to discuss this with.  So find a like minded person and try not to watch too much of this at once; it's much better in small doses (maybe one episode a day).  I can't recommend Lain enough, but try renting and watching the first disk (the entire thing, it starts out a little slow) before you make any commitments.",1022457600,4,1680,4.428571428571429

However, like Evangelion, it is a complex series that many viewers (particularly young or unattentive viewer) may not understand. So I can only recomend this if you do prefer to be stimulated in the mind instead or watching the kick-butt action anime is commercially known for. (there is violence, but no fighting action)
I highly recomend it though if you like this though ( I love it, as you can see from most of my other reviews this is what draws me in), it is worth the price.

Also, the main characters (especially the heroine) were so cold and souless I found I simply couldn't relate to any of them.

Other people have reviewed the actual basic storyline, so I'll just curb my comments to my reaction to this outstanding and pivotal anime.
This series is nothing like other anime, at least none that I've seen.  The story is enough to warp your mind forever...
The first time I watched this, after every episode, I sat through the ending theme, barely even listening to it, just stunned by the visual and mental tidbits thrown at me during the episode.  I have never thought so hard about an anime; even after watching it, even when I was nowhere near my dvd player, I kept thinking about it, and about how some of its points apply to today's technology-driven world.
Do not be worried if you do not ""get it"" in the first volume, or the second, or even the third.  This is a puzzle for which you need ALL the pieces (every episode) before you even begin to comprehend what is going on, and how everything fits together.  Repeated viewings are a necessity if you really want understanding, so if you are looking for a light-hearted anime that doesn't require a lot of thought, this is NOT for you.
Astonishingly pertinent to today, this series is an absolute must-see for those who love shows that are different, who love to have their minds messed with (in good ways), and who love beautifully-crafted works of intelligent art.",1013385600,14,1693,4.757679180887372

What's even more creepy is that a few days later all the girls in her class start getting email from her about how she 'merely abbandoned her body and how she is living in The Wired'. Everyone ofcourse is terribly upset about this but Lain being curious replies to the message...
That's the beginning of a terribly deep, confusing and fascinating tale.
The overal question in the series is wether or not Lain is a real girl. Other topics covered are ""what is reality"" and ""what exactly is God"".

1385232,5,B00005094P,"We're all connected... Come to the ""Wired"" as soon as you can... Why won't you come? ...Why won't you come...?
Serial Experiments Lain is deep, very deep. As an anime almost indescribable, it will stick will you for life as it haunts you with its silent mysteries. Never have I seen an anime anything like this one. I remember the nights where Lain just stood in my head, as I wondered how the true secrets would eventually uncover from their cloaked darkness.
The artwork that was shown in this raging series was that of which reminded me of something from a basic MTV cartoon. Of course this isn't awful at any bit, it's just a different style with a nice appeal of eye candy and detailed but somewhat creepy designs. The unique computer (or according to this anime title, ""Navi"") and electrical designs/styles were done very beautifully and caught my eye every time. I curiously noted much of the Navi features and I thought about the terrific effort that was placed into animating each little part of the visually pleasing features. If you look hard enough at Serial Experiments Lain's art, you'll spot marvelous examples of well-done (and not to mention talented) Japanese animation creations. So, although the visual artwork can be a tad strange every once and awhile, it is fine non-the less and is something oddly different.
A major part of Serial Experiments Lain to me was the puzzling, tragic, and disturbing story to it. I was almost completely lost during the first and second volumes, but then once you hit a little further into the series, everything starts to slowly pile together and make sense.
Lain is fourteen years old, regular amount of friends, quiet and un-social, but lately Lain seems to be different. What is happening to her the life around her... her world... what is it? After getting an unknown e-mail from a girl in Lain's class who has killed herself, everything starts becoming different... but why? ""The Wired"" (or this anime's version of something very similar to the internet) is the popular thing to the many kids (are they really kids...?) around her. Everyone's on it. What's so good about it? Could it be holding some sort of lethal secret that Lain is to find out? But... why Lain? What is this ""Wired?"" Is the ""Wired"" the reasoning for all of the ghostly events that have been happening recently?! Could a world of some sort be slowly dripping into our own.....
We're all connected... Come to the ""Wired"" as soon as you can... Why won't you come? ...Why won't you come...?
The seiyuu went marvelously well with the characters they played. Although the Japanese voice actors selected for Lain were none of which seemed too, too popular and well known, I still enjoyed listening to their smooth voices. Even Lain's seiyuu had special inside scenes (called ""Devices"") at the end of each DVD where you could see a part of the body interact and be described unusually by her. I found this very interesting. The seiyuu picked for Serial Experiments Lain were = Shimizu Kaori as Iwakura Lain, Igarashi Rei as Iwakura Miho, Kawazumi Ayako as Iwakura Mika, Obayashi Ryuunosuke as Iwakura Yasuo, Asada Yoko as Mizuki Arisu, Chiba Shigeru as Nezumi, Mizuno Manabi as Katou Juri, Morizumi Ari as JJ, Muto Kotomi as Yomoda Chisa, Neya Michiko as Yoshii Keiko, and Tezuka Chiharu as Yamamoto Reika. Quite an interestingly and nicely picked selection, I truly believe.
There wasn't very much music of any type played throughout the series. I recall seldom hearing background music, but the background music that was played fit well with the actually incident that was occurring at the time. The outstanding and catchy ""Duvet"" opening song (which in either type of version of Lain you view) is in English. Actually to tell you the truth, when I first heard the song, I thought it was sung by one of my favorite songwriters of all time - Alanis Morissette (which of course, is a good thing). In fact, the female who does sing the song, strangely does remind me of an Asian-type Alanis. I must also compliment on the ending song, which had more of a rock theme to it, unlike the pop opening. So, definitely a high score for the music.
Be warned before you even think about purchasing this splendid anime series, that it is horror-filled anime that may seriously disturb children under thirteen years of age due to the highly mature themes, mysterious and creepy aspects of life, emotional unbalance, strong language, uneven occult-action, and wondrous themes such as the ones I have already listed! ^^ But definitely don't miss Lain if you're looking for a different emotionally haunting anime that will make you reflect on your life and what could be awaiting in your future. I remember first watching Lain and asking myself, ""What is this life...?"" Serial Experiments Lain will amaze you at how it leeches your open mind and makes you think about... the unknown...

1385233,2,B00005094P,"I have a lot of friends who totally love Lain, and I guess I can understand why; it's certainly an expertly crafted and well-directed series. However, there is one thing this series is lacking, and that is character. Nobody in Lain really has much of a personality. Things happen to them, but we very rarely have any idea how they FEEL about it, and frankly that makes for a rather unengaging series. Also, I find myself personally being irritated by shows that don't make sense until people explain them to you. I mean, seriously, what's the point of watching it if you don't even know what the heck is going on, or really care?
Lain does, however, get bonus points for suggesting that Hayami Sho is God. Woohoo!",1004313600,7,713,4.578125

But that's ok, it's a great story and the visuals are just amazing. And don't forget the audio, thou just a 2.0 stereo sound it sounds great.

Neon Genesis Evangelion.
Like the other previewer said, there aren't any giant robos or such, but after looking at it, you'll have to think about many things you wouldn't have expected turning up in an anime, you simply get engaged with the story ... but you have to take this anime seriously, or, like in NGE, the story won't be as half as magnificient as if you did ...

It's a stoic look at society, cyberspace, and what we deem to be reality. There is a great deal of religious symbolism, as well as bizarre imagery and themes. The animation style is very clean and crisp, and the series is very serious. There are no ""facefaults"" ""Sweatdrops"" or ""Superdeformed"" animation typical of many animes. It's serious anime in the same manner as Akira and Perfect Blue.",999388800,,527,4.866666666666666
1385241,5,B00005094P,"There aren't many storylines out there(anime or not) that can leave you speechless; however, Lain has one of those. The story has been so well contrived that many of the foreshadows aren't understood until you've seen the entire series in full, leaving me watching the series over and over again.

1385242,5,B00005094P,"Lain is a true masterpiece.  Though short, it is an amazing story with eerie visuals and a dark gothic atmosphere.  It is the story of a young girl and the evolving technology that causes her to question the difference between man and machine.  It can be quite confusing most of the time and only leaves you wanting more.  Each time I watch it, I find something new.  There is little ation in Lain, so some may be bored.  However, if you enjoy creepy and intriguing anime that makes you think, give Lain a try.  Japanese trailers and conceptual drawings are also provided on each disc for your enjoyment.",998524800,3,604,4.537037037037037

First thing you see is the openening, with music by Boa, and you go ""woah.""  Then whamo! Your instantly sucked into the story of a young girl who is... well, its kinda hard to explain what the story is about.  It can only be described as the Sci-fi mamma of all Sci-fi animes.  No, there isn't any giant robots, or girls in mini skirts, but there is a great story that will give a trip on your mind.",998092800,3,539,4.235294117647059

It's hard to explain it without spoiling everything, but if you liked things like ""The Animatrix, Aeonflux, Ergo Proxy, or the Ideology of the Matrix, then you may like this one. Lain is a kind of slow anime at first, it takes about 4 episodes for the ""good"" stuff to happen, like major plot points, but if you can make it past the first 4 episodes and you're still drawn in, then keep going, lain is a rabbit-hole of an anime and it was definitely ahead of its time.",1421971200,,641,4.440677966101695
