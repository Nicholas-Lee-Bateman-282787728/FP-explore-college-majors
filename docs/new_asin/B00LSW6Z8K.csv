Glad to see early in the movie the mention of the Philadelphia indie record label, Cameo-Parkway when they enter the record store.",1421020800,4,173,4.612903225806452

6501421,4,B00LSW6Z8K,"A new entry into the 'gritty British film' category comes this early 70s set drama. Set in a town near Bolton (figured out because they say Buzz instead of bus in the film), it focuses in John who is drifting aimlessly at school, no thanks to the likes of his parents who just think he's weird and his teacher who embarrasses him in front of the class and calls him names. On a first trip out to a youth club he comes across the local wannabe DJ Matt who wants to play American soul music rather than the chart hits. These two outsiders share the passion for the Detroit musicians and come together to get the music played in the clubs, an antidote to the sounds of the 60s, a new way of moving on the dance floor before disco.

The film looks authentic and is set, like other good British films, in a town that looks like it's about to be bulldozed. The tag line for the film is 'if you were there you'd know, if you weren't, you'd wish you had been. Though the music sounds good the drugtaking is shown to the max, with lots of pill popping and injections, leading to inevitable tragedy near the end of the film. I'm certainly glad I wasn't there!

Good acting from the fairly unknown leads, they definitely look the part, but the listings of Steve Coogan, Ricky Tomlinson and Lisa Stansfield in the cast list are the light relief and no more than cameo roles. The only humour in the whole film revolves around Coogan's evil teacher.

It's not going to have a mass appeal but can easily claim it's place amongst other 'period' movies and sits well alongside Pride as one of the better British films out this year",1417219200,6,1614,4.355481727574751

8667851,5,B00LSW6Z8K,"Arrived quickly, packed safely and securely.  I stumbled across the ""Northern Soul"" movement accidentally on YouTube while looking for 60's & 70's music videos.  This movie gave me the thought of a UK version of Dirty Dancing just because of the music and dance, nobody puts Baby in the corner though.  It was interesting to learn about how certain records had fake labels to mask the type of music and the hunt for certain music that the young people were looking for, the hit and miss of playing a record with a masked label, spoiler alert !  The golden record is found,  Watch the old Northern Soul filmed videos on YouTube and check out this movie.",1510876800,,652,4.586206896551724

Great music.",1479600000,,128,4.375
8667853,5,B00LSW6Z8K,"Loved this film and I bought the soundtrack as well, which has some great songs.",1471651200,,80,4.4
8667854,4,B00LSW6Z8K,"Ehhhhhhhhh...big hopes for this one, feel a little let down because I wanted to see this so damn bad. I mean good story and acting was good, just took weird unexpected turns that I was kinda confused on, and why this person got on with this person but lost interest in the other...and the music was good, but I expected at least some bigger stereotypical Northern Soul hits...I mean where is Frank Wilson - Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)...Damn endless people have tattoos of that...Slight nod at a bigger club here and there...I just kinda expected some major nods to more obvious people, because this is really set up for an audience of those who were alive then or are really really into the scene now. I love it, but not obsessed so maybe I don't see the big picture or something.",1469232000,,781,4.430555555555555

8667858,5,B00LSW6Z8K,"Got my juices flowing! I was growing up in school in the seventies and, although I was in the American South, soul music rocked my soul. Fantastic film tribute to a great underground movement, and really great talent involved, too. Loved this film! Didn't want it to end.",1444867200,,271,4.666666666666667
