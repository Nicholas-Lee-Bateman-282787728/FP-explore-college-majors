Without out giving the whole movie away, I was very disappointed by the ending.  Im not going to completely knock the  movie, but it did not keep my interest, and it is not my type of movie.  Maybe others will appreciate more than I did.",962150400,,341,4.184615384615385
7894035,5,6305744319,"So, I saw this damn good movie on a german filmfestival in oldenburg last year. We all know that Mickey is at his very lowest point of life, he uses drugs as most people uses water and bread every day. And in this movie he  plays himself: A always drunken, always on the wrong side of the law acting  policeman. So: Why did he become like this? The ""hero"" of this  film killed Mickey's wife in a accidently act of self-defense. And as he  leaves the prison to get a job and a normal life, Mickey interact these  plans that clever to destroy our lovely and handsome hero. No happyend, and  that's good.",952992000,4,601,4.274336283185841
