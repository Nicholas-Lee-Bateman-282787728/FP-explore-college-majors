8135227,4,B000GYI3HC,After watching this video I realized there are many many ways to develop your home layout to look realistic without spending much money. The whole DVD presented a great view on different projects and ideas to help a person to decide how to work on a layout and time is a big factor plus you can always make changes. This DVD would be very helpful for a beginner and also help trying to decide what gauge to use.,1190851200,9,411,4.282051282051282
