7951428,5,B00005QY8G,"Ok... This disc changed my life. It's the first anime I ever bought, & 100's of purchases later, still my very favorite.
But it took it me a couple years. At first it was good and bewildering, then a couple months later rewatching it (usually around midnight), even moreso... And so on...Over a year later, it finally just drowned me utterly- what a work of art!
  Although I ""get"" anime better now from my 5 years of fandom, BP4 still cracks me open into tears of euphoria.
  As far as surreal, non-linear shows go, this makes Yellow Submarine look like The Flintstones- but Boogiepop is SO much more. At first, you glimpse in Ep. 10: PoomPoom, scenes from previous episodes, but beware; I found that watching the whole series imparts more questions than answers.
  And the peak of this mysterious series for me is this disc, and notably Ep. 10: which I think stands on its own, even if one chooses not to collect the rest of the dvds or manga (but I don't advise that.) It really IS art for heart's sake: by that I mean, it is an astounding sensual audiovisual poem: I guarantee to people who love to love stuff, that this disc is worthy: you can wrap your arms tight around the unique personal horrors and bliss and transcendence of whatever Boogiepop Phantom means to you- and even more intensely the next year. I would recommend this particular disc to children, teenagers, college students, and adult aesthetes, fans of cartoons, art, music, dreams, nightmares, prophecies, monsters, aliens, memory, identity, astral projection, the unconscious, death ...; it's just a sublime phantasmagoria of the personal, inner landscape, cleverly disguised as an animated tv show.
All hyperbole aside, (and without regard to the rest of the dvds and manga): I find this to be an apotheosis of human creation: watch it as an observer, rewatch it, rewatch it, rewatch it... And someday a part of you will live in it: and because of this, you will know that when you, & humankind & the planet is long gone, it will have all been worth it if only to have been a conscious being who watched Boogiepop Phantom.",1439510400,,2098,4.6875
7951429,5,B00005QY8G,"Unlike many an anime series that uses confusion as a plot device, Boogiepop Phantom actually does try to tie up many of its loose ends, in particular those that revolve around Poom Poom and Manaka.  These latter are tied into the grand story arc of memory and change that drives so much of the plot.

It takes a bit of thought to see how the pieces fit, but all the clues are there and everything that went into this series was necessary to get to episode ""Under the Gravity Rainbow,"" which it the first of the two endings required by the story.  Echo, Boogiepop, and the Manticore, all released in that great explosion of light, all working within the framework of a humanity that is in the throes of its own evolution.

Manaka's ability as Echo to recreate memories makes her the source from which Poom Poom draws the power of regret.  What we have seen in so many episodes is how regret drives out the childlike part of us that is our inner source of wellbeing.  Regret as denial keeps us from working through the changes of our lives and turns us into stunted adults.

The second arc is that of the hunt for the Manticore, a creature that echoes many of the traditional Japanese demons that feed on human pain and misery.  Boogiepop was his hunter, when a great release of electromagnetic energy drove parts of them into available hosts.  In the last episode, ""A Requiem"" this conflict plays out for the last time, signals by the first use of full color in the entire series.  One young girl takes her college entrance exams while another frees the world for its own evolution.  It takes a sacrifice and the first willing experience of loss to achieve a final, and hopeful, ending.

In retrospect, what will always amaze me about this series is the incredible detail to which the episodes are driven.  Everything is interconnected and the eye that refuses to accept the apparent confusion is rewarded with a deeply layered story of which I have only touched the two major sub-plots.  If you believe anime has real potential as a serious art form then Boogiepop Phantom, like Serial Experiments: Lain is a vivid demonstrations of the possibilities.",1113177600,,2151,4.641160949868074
7951430,5,B00005QY8G,"The three episodes on Evolution 4 of Boogiepop Phantom bring this enlightening and at times transcendantal anime series to an end. Poom Poom, the Pied Piper-like figure who has been taking the youthful souls of the city has created a dreamlike world of eternal childhood in a closed down amusement park. That's when our intrepid high school investigator, Nagi, shows up to rain on the parade, and then Poom Poom's party is further dampened by the arrival of Boogiepop. And we finally see who Manaka really is, yeah, the clueless idiot girl who creates glowing butterflies of past memories. Episode 12, ""Requiem"", has a totally different look than any of the previous episodes and ties up the loose ends.

After watching this series, I can safely say I've never seen anything like it. Maybe a Virginia Woolf novel is the closest comparison, so complex is the use of time and space in Boogiepop. This series is a song of memory and horror singing across a memory of a city that is constantly changing and a group of young people who do not want to become adults and have their souls sucked out of their bodies. The film noirish look of this dark title perfectly matches the nightmarish context. It is a reflection of life, with no end to the depth of the characters we encounter. Seek the entire series of Boogiepop Phantom out. Now.",1107561600,3,1331,4.688034188034188
7951431,5,B00005QY8G,"When ideology is spent on the young, the world wears a different mask than it does as they grow brittle and ingest experiences that changes their perception. Here, existence is something encased in purity and thusfar unsoiled, not yet hardened by the mental torments that come with the passing of years. Instead of a lack of beauty, there is only childlike innocence within the formations that answer the wandering gazes of youth. The need to hold onto things left behind, the feeling we come to know as regret, hasn't yet haunted the mind like an eerie spectralization that will, over time, make itself known.
When the light erupts in the midst of that silent night, many things seem to changed almost immediately. Now, the world is plagued by people exhibiting strange powers and something stalks the landscape claiming lives. Within this surreally terrifying world, one girl with a horrific past that is given another chance to exist outside those boundaries. Out of it she creates something seemingly fabulous, bringing out the youth within people that will come and visit her. Still, these phantoms are merely monstrosities, and the reasoning behind who she is and what she has cause invites BoogiePop, the angel of death, to come and visit. Why is it like this, though, and why does the angel of death find this return to innocence a transgression? That, and a conclusion to the pulsing skies, is what this piece offers.
The last DVD in the series is almost as important as the third in the explanation of what has transpired within those skies and how the girl with the butterflies has come to be. While going through the motions of introducing her and the life she has led, the episodes place many more of the tiles into their given spots. This places the remaining keys into their homes and unlocks many doors that were still barred, leaving a few questions here and there but answering mostly all of them. With it, the child known as Poom-Poom is explained as well, and closure is brought to the series at the end, when the BoogiePop Phantom is revealed as a person and the person behind the mask is one that has been noticed on several occasions. All of this takes place with the usual darkness that seems to stretch throughout the horizon of sights and sounds, with thunderous moments of terror playing hand in hand with explanations of what exactly is going on.
For anyone that has yet to look into the series, this is something that you should take in stride and in order, letting it build properly so that it makes sense. Otherwise, terms like ""echoes"" and ""the manticore"" will mean nothing to you and you'll simply wonder exactly what horror is taking those child one by one. If you've already invested the time into watching the others and have liked them thusfar, then this is a piece that you won't want to leave out because it finishes the tasks at hand. To me, I thought that this piece was as essential as the first three in its own right, following through with the completed painting made by twelve separate entities.",1048550400,7,3041,4.7180451127819545
7951432,5,B00005QY8G,"Ok, a review without spoilers....
  The artwork is a bit simple, but still good. It's sort of a ""minimalist-anime"" style. Unfortunately, there is some jpeg granularity in the DVD, but I found that easy to ignore.
  The art has an interesting fishbowl effect. In the first DVD, I thought this would be annoying. It was not. The art also has strong sepia and earthy coloration until the last episode.
  The music is good, and the music on the last DVD is great. (the song for the last scene in episode 10 was beautiful and fit perfectly.)
  The nonlinear story used up to this point takes a bit of getting used to. In DVD 4, the chronological order of events is held to a bit more strongly than the previous DVD's (meaning: ""a bit more than very little""), but there are still many flashbacks.
  The dialogue is very sharp. If you do not read quickly or speak fluent Japanese, watch it at least once in English. (You *will* watch it more than once.) The script is quite good.
  On watching it again, due to the nonlinear story arc, a nice thing about this series is that if you want to go back and watch a previous episode, it seems to fit in well enough at any point (up to the last DVD). Re-watching episodes doesn't break the continuity of the story; sometimes it actually helps you pick up on things.
  Specific to the last DVD (Evolution 4), the story really ends with episodes 10 & 11. The final episode wraps up a few loose ends, but it's the typical Japanese ""see how life goes on"" ending. Episodes 10&11, however, can be seen as one long episode, whereas most other episodes stand on their own. Much is resolved, and with so much dialogue about ""loosing and regaining what is really important,"" I think it's interesting to see what the authors considered important enough to resolve in these two episodes.
  (As a side note, I think the entire ""What a terrible Pied Piper you are,"" scene at the end of episode 10 absolutely rocked, and the music is beautiful.)
  Note that there are many things left unresolved. Apparently, the series is based on a Japanese book series, which explains and resolves more. You can figure out just about everything, but it requires paying attention and listening to what's said.
  Requisite comparison to ""Lain"": Since I'm not a cyber-child, Lain didn't have as strong an emotional or personal impact as Boogiepop. Having finished both, I prefer Boogiepop.",1013472000,9,2393,4.612293144208038
