3077839,3,B0012680AS,"Don't get me wrong, I've been a big fan of McHale's Navy from the very beginning when it premiered on ABC. It's been many years since I've seen the vast majority of any of these episodes. There's little doubt that being a child slanted my memories of this. But I have found that to be true most of the time. McHale's Navy: Season One was such a joy to see. Season two saw a drop in quality but not much. Season three is reduced to the level of a child & features Tim Conway much too prominently; this set borders more on slapstick.

Once again, don't get me wrong, most television series have a common denominator, they tend to cater to a simpler taste. That, in itself, isn't a bad thing, but it appears the quality control department just quit on this season. Oh, it still has entertainment value but the series is way too predictable in this season. McHale's Navy is NOT a reality show & that's a part of it's charm. Season three simply relies too much on Tim Conway & that's not a good thing. Mr. Conway has always been better in a supporting role but in many of these episodes they all but make him the star.

With all that being said I still enjoyed it. Just beware, the age quotient dropped several years for season three. Unlike the previous season sets there aren't any bonus features available here. And look for a young Raquel Welch in one of the episodes!!!

P.S. I noticed a considerable amount of difference in volume between some of the episodes. At times I had to raise the volume by ten or twelve points when playing the next episode.",1208044800,10,1551,4.378472222222222
3077840,5,B0012680AS,"McHale and his merry band of tricksters are back for a third season of zany and whacky hijinks against their enemy!  The Japanese?  No, silly!! Captain Binghamton and his sycophantic sidekick, Carpenter!  Gone is Happy (Gavin McLeod), but he is not missed--there are still enough Tricksters to keep things going.
In this season, the episodes become much more creative--there are even several dream sequences.  This results in more outlandish plots.  But each one is a scream.  The interplay between Binghamton (Joe Flynn--who played his role so over the top!) and Parker (Tim Conway--who is funny just to look at) is played to the hilt and is a joy to watch.  This season is even better than before.  The chemistry between all the characters is perfect.  I think all the actors must have really enjoyed making this show.
If you like silly, funny, clean shows, this is for you.  It's good family fun.  Sit back and get ready to bust a gut!",1206576000,13,938,4.763975155279503
3077841,4,B0012680AS,"The 138 half-hour episodes and the one-hour pilot of the service comedy ""McHale's Navy"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1962-1966.  Although not as well known today as ""Hogan's Heroes"" (1965-1971 on CBS), it was a precursor and inspiration for that show.  Unlike the 1950's peacetime world of Sgt. Bilko (""The Phil Silvers' Show""), these two shows were based on the inherently amusing idea that although WWII was in progress, those involved could still enjoy themselves.  While Colonel Hogan and his men operated out of a POW camp in Europe, McHale and his P.T. boat crew were based on an island in the South Pacific.  P.T. (pocket torpedo) boats were quite the rage in the early 1960's because of accounts of President Kennedy's WWII service aboard one.  The series was given a further boast when Kennedy's exploits were profiled in ""PT-109"" (1963).

McHale (Ernest Borgnine) choose the island because it is isolated from the area's main Naval base and his main adversary Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn), whose unexplained nickname is ""Old Lead Bottom"".  Binghamton is the Colonel Klink of the series although in this case he and McHale are supposed to be on the same side.  McHale and his crew are allowed to stay on the island because it allows them to respond faster to threats from their mutual adversary, the Japanese Navy.

While Colonels Hall and Klink actually seem to like Bilko and Hogan, Binghamton clearly dislikes and resents McHale.  The main sources of comedy are the futile attempts of Binghamton and his obsequious subaltern Elroy Carpenter to discredit and discipline McHale and his crew.  Of course McHale's crew provides them plenty of opportunities, while their combat performance is excellent their off-duty time is spent on a variety of unauthorized activities.

Only two members of McHale's crew are particularly noteworthy.  The bumbling and nave Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) and money grubbing schemer Lester Gruber (Carl Ballantine), a character loosely based on Ray Walston's Luther Billis in ""South Pacific"" (1958).  Conway was clearly the show's greatest asset.

This DVD set contains the 36 episodes from Season Three, the weakest of the four seasons.  By this point the writers were obviously running out of original ideas and in desperation resorted to showcasing Fugi Kobiaji (Yoshio Yoda), an escaped POW.  Fugi was a pacifist Japanese sailor being sheltered by the P.T. 109 crew on their island.  He had been an ""extremely minor character"" in the earlier seasons for a lot of good reasons (insert Pearl Harbor here) and whatever comedy potential the idea once had was not well served by the expansion of his screen time.

The series improved a bit in its next and final season when the crew was shifted to the European front and began operating in Italy.  Season Four was a classic case of ""something so bad that it was almost good"", as there was a perverse charm to these surreal episodes which had absolutely no connection with reality.

The series also spawned two feature films, ""McHale's Navy"" (1964) and McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force"" (1965).

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1206230400,7,3140,5.007707129094412

3077868,5,B0012680AS,I have always been a fan of McHale's Navy. My biggest regret was when the series left the airwaves for good. I'm delighted that Shout Factory had the good sense to resurrect it on DVD because every season had episodes I missed a lot. Some of video tape quality didn't hold up too well as I notice that some portions are worn due to age and less than adequate handling of the master reels. The show itself is a timeless classic and is worth having. McHale's Navy is a landmark series from the golden age of comedy.,1387670400,,513,4.298969072164948

3077884,5,B0012680AS,"Season 3 is just as entertaining as the first 2 seasons of McHale's Navy. The antics of how Capt. Binghamton is always out to get McHale and his misfit crew of pirates continues into Season 3. Bumbling Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) adds his crazy comical genius into every episode.

DVD series continues with quality, but I missed the outtakes of talking to the remaining survivors of that show as they did in the first season. I think they had a few interviews in the 2nd season DVD. I always find this as enjoyable as watching the episodes, if not more so, because it gives you a little insight of the personalities behind the TV series.",1281052800,2,636,4.530434782608696

3077886,4,B0012680AS,"Everyone likes a comedy that puts one over on authority figures. That probably goes back to the stoneage. In film, it goes at
least as far back as The Keystone Cops. In this case McHale`s band of pirates are getting under the skin of the navy. The navy, in
the form of Joe Flynn that is.
To be truthful, by the 3rd season the series was getting just a bit worn. The 1st and 2nd seasons were better. I would give those
5 stars instead of 4 as I gave this one. Still, with comedians of the caliber of Tim Conway and Joe Flynn, you really can`t go

3077889,5,B0012680AS,"I have been a great fan of McHale's Navy for many, many years and this third season set still makes me laugh. I must have watched these episodes quite a few times now since I have bought the series set. Gavin McLeod as Seaman 'Happy' Haynes is gone but the on-going duel of wits between LTCOMDR McHale (Ernest Borgnine), ably (?) assisted by his stumbling Executive Officer, Ensign Parker (Tim Conway), and Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn), with HIS stumbling Aide Lt. Carpenter (Bob Hastings); are what makes each episode. The conniving and scheming goes on relentlessly, as McHale always comes out just ahead of his CO.

There are some 'bloopers' in some of the episodes and these are ones I have picked up, readers may have noticed others:

Episode 3.3 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad War-Captain Binghamton is involved in an 'accident' involving cream cakes, in the next scene his uniform is unsoiled.

Episode 3.4 McHale the Desk Commando-McHale looks out of the office window to see Gruber with one of his 'shindigs' underway, when the scene cuts to outside, the same windows appear to be shuttered closed.

Episode 3.6 Laugh Captain, Laugh-Captain Binghamton sees McHale and his men outside his office and walks out the door of his office without his hat on, the hat is seen sitting on top of his office safe; when the scene cuts to outside the office, Binghamton appears with the hat on his head.

Episode 3.8 The British Also Have Ensigns-Parker spills a pot of tea over Binghamton, when the scene returns, Binghamton's uniform is unsoiled. In another scene in this episode, there is a water jug sitting on a side table in Binghamton's office, when the scene changes to a close-up of McHale standing in front of the office safe, the water jug is now seen on top of the safe, behind his right ear. When the scene cuts back to a full view of everyone in the office, the water jug is now back on the side table. This blooper repeats itself three times until the scene changes.

Episode 3.13 Christy Goes Travelling-When the PR Captain talks to Parker (thinking he is Christy), he asks what is Christy's wife name and Parker responds, to which the PR Captain says ""I thought her name was Ruth?!"" In earlier Episodes, Christy's wife is named 'Gloria'. The aircraft in the scenes have post-war US markings of the USAF, which didn't occur until two years after the war (September 1947).

Episode 3.21 All Chiefs and No Indians-The 73 boat, with Ensign Parker at the helm, is seen with the forward 0.50 Cal machine gun set in the middle of the forward deck, in a later scene, the same gun is now mounted well forward, near the bow.

Episode 3.22 Pumpkin Takes Over-The aircraft that Parker assists Captain Binghamton's wife, Pumpkin, onto sports post-war USAF markings on it.

With the release of Season Four-set in Italy; the follow on has been to put the two movies onto DVD as a double set, so now McHale's Navy is complete. Several years after the series finished, Universal commenced to convert the Black and White episodes into colour. These were put out on Australian TV and I wonder if there is any plan to put the colour episodes onto DVD now?

THEN they can focus on getting rights to other obscure shows, great ones that nobody cares about, like SUPER PRESIDENT! thats such a killer, yet obscure cartoon. and then howabout the beatles cartoons? just give yoko ono a big iron boot, and get those beatles cartoons free from her CLAWS! then the barkleys.. theres so many great ones they can be putting energy towards releasing. thats how i feel, howabout all you other mchales navy and milton the monster show fans? find shout factory email address, bombard with complaints and ideas to stop this VOLUME lolligagging nonsense! ! !",1211673600,,1135,4.68

3077898,1,B0012680AS,"While this is one good series,I am not happy at what I have learned and what I have to pass on to you all out there.
If you have read any of my past reviews on these sets you will know I have brought to your attention picture problems associated with them. Those problems,coupled with three more that appear in this set compelled me to finally write to Shout Factory to get to the bottom of things and they more than confirmed suspicions I have had about these sets.
Along with those past problems I have always noticed that when a scene fades in it is terribly out of focus until the film reaches its' proper illumination point. Come this Season Three set,two more problems were in evidence. First was on an ep early on,on Disc three when all figures suddenly develop severe jagged edges. It comes and goes until it finally disappears. This is something I have seen in conjunction with video tape. The second but most glaring problem occurs right off the bat on Disc One,ep#1. Throughout the ep there are numerous appearances of VIDEO TAPE LINES.Yes,I said video tape lines! They also appear to a lesser degree in other eps on Disc one but the first ep is the worst by far.
This did it for me,so I contacted Shout Factory and to their credit I got two responses from a David Landau and Melissa Boag. My questions to both and their subsequent answers were virtually the same so I'll give you an answer from both. To Mr. Landau I asked about the video lines I was seeing. His response:
""Hello
We used the best available masters given the nature of this release.
These little tape rolls were noticed and we were unable to find an
alternate source. Most of the time we can find something to replace
these, but in some instances we had to use a master with one or two
minor glitches to replace an episode that was unwatchable. Hope this
information helps. Thanks
-Shout!
Factory""

My second querie was to confirm then that indeed Shout factory had NOT gone back to the original film elements and had not remastered the series. Melissa Boags' response was:
""Hi Bob,
Yes you are correct in your assumption. I checked with production and
here is what I understand:

""What they are experiencing are brief tape rolls that exist on the video
source. I, along with NBC, sourced the best masters. Unfortunately,
there was no other source for ep 1.""

""Yes, this means these have not been remastered, but rather best source
available used. We felt it better to include these rather than cut down
the shows.""

I hope that clarifies your situation and explains the history. Please
let me know if you have any additional questions.
Regards, Melissa""

So there you have it folks. To satify yourselves,look on all of your three sets of Mchale's Navy and no where will you see the words ""Remastered"". However never in my wildest dreams did I ever think they would ever release something of such low credibility and standard. Tape lines!!?? Why this is the very same issue I took Hallmark video to task on in one of my earlier reviews of their release of a Laurel and Hardy compilation on DVD.
Melissa's answer that ""We felt it better to include these rather than cut down the shows"" makes it sound like we,as consumers,should be grateful that our hard earned money was plunked down to buy such junk. Sorry Melissa,I respect your answer and honesty,but this kind of product is the kind that should never see the light of day. It is Mickey Mouse,pure amateurism,and NO one should have to accept this. It is totally unforgiveable.
As an aside,it should be stated(to be fair)that Shout isn't the only company that releases product that hasn't been remastered from original source elements. Many times DVDS are released just using the available masters,which at the time the company deems ""acceptable"".You will also see later that a company will pull that release and issue a newly remastered one.""Acceptable"" is a relative term,depending on your point of view. Another point here is cost. Remastering,when done properly,does adds to the cost of a release. Priorities?
There you have it friends.
My recommendation,if it isn't obvious by now,is to AVOID this,past and future releases of Mchale's Navy at all costs. It has NOT been remastered and the video lines extant here in Season Three,along with the other problems I have listed here and in previous reviews,pretty much tell the entire sorry story by themselves. There is no way we should accept or encourage such releases by purchasing sub standard product such as this.
The responses by Mr. Landau and Ms. Boag of Shout are appreciated but they are just icing on a cake that is bad to begin with.",1208822400,12,4627,4.693349753694581

3312336,3,B0012680AS,"Don't get me wrong, I've been a big fan of McHale's Navy from the very beginning when it premiered on ABC. It's been many years since I've seen the vast majority of any of these episodes. There's little doubt that being a child slanted my memories of this. But I have found that to be true most of the time. McHale's Navy: Season One was such a joy to see. Season two saw a drop in quality but not much. Season three is reduced to the level of a child & features Tim Conway much too prominently; this set borders more on slapstick.

Once again, don't get me wrong, most television series have a common denominator, they tend to cater to a simpler taste. That, in itself, isn't a bad thing, but it appears the quality control department just quit on this season. Oh, it still has entertainment value but the series is way too predictable in this season. McHale's Navy is NOT a reality show & that's a part of it's charm. Season three simply relies too much on Tim Conway & that's not a good thing. Mr. Conway has always been better in a supporting role but in many of these episodes they all but make him the star.

With all that being said I still enjoyed it. Just beware, the age quotient dropped several years for season three. Unlike the previous season sets there aren't any bonus features available here. And look for a young Raquel Welch in one of the episodes!!!

P.S. I noticed a considerable amount of difference in volume between some of the episodes. At times I had to raise the volume by ten or twelve points when playing the next episode.",1208044800,10,1551,4.378472222222222

Captain Binghamton and his sycophantic sidekick, Carpenter!  Gone is Happy (Gavin McLeod), but he is not missed--there are still enough Tricksters to keep things going.
In this season, the episodes become much more creative--there are even several dream sequences.  This results in more outlandish plots.  But each one is a scream.  The interplay between Binghamton (Joe Flynn--who played his role so over the top!) and Parker (Tim Conway--who is funny just to look at) is played to the hilt and is a joy to watch.  This season is even better than before.  The chemistry between all the characters is perfect.  I think all the actors must have really enjoyed making this show.

3312338,4,B0012680AS,"The 138 half-hour episodes and the one-hour pilot of the service comedy ""McHale's Navy"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1962-1966.  Although not as well known today as ""Hogan's Heroes"" (1965-1971 on CBS), it was a precursor and inspiration for that show.  Unlike the 1950's peacetime world of Sgt. Bilko (""The Phil Silvers' Show""), these two shows were based on the inherently amusing idea that although WWII was in progress, those involved could still enjoy themselves.  While Colonel Hogan and his men operated out of a POW camp in Europe, McHale and his P.T. boat crew were based on an island in the South Pacific.  P.T. (pocket torpedo) boats were quite the rage in the early 1960's because of accounts of President Kennedy's WWII service aboard one.  The series was given a further boast when Kennedy's exploits were profiled in ""PT-109"" (1963).

McHale (Ernest Borgnine) choose the island because it is isolated from the area's main Naval base and his main adversary Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn), whose unexplained nickname is ""Old Lead Bottom"".  Binghamton is the Colonel Klink of the series although in this case he and McHale are supposed to be on the same side.  McHale and his crew are allowed to stay on the island because it allows them to respond faster to threats from their mutual adversary, the Japanese Navy.

While Colonels Hall and Klink actually seem to like Bilko and Hogan, Binghamton clearly dislikes and resents McHale.  The main sources of comedy are the futile attempts of Binghamton and his obsequious subaltern Elroy Carpenter to discredit and discipline McHale and his crew.  Of course McHale's crew provides them plenty of opportunities, while their combat performance is excellent their off-duty time is spent on a variety of unauthorized activities.

Only two members of McHale's crew are particularly noteworthy.  The bumbling and nave Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) and money grubbing schemer Lester Gruber (Carl Ballantine), a character loosely based on Ray Walston's Luther Billis in ""South Pacific"" (1958).  Conway was clearly the show's greatest asset.

This DVD set contains the 36 episodes from Season Three, the weakest of the four seasons.  By this point the writers were obviously running out of original ideas and in desperation resorted to showcasing Fugi Kobiaji (Yoshio Yoda), an escaped POW.  Fugi was a pacifist Japanese sailor being sheltered by the P.T. 109 crew on their island.  He had been an ""extremely minor character"" in the earlier seasons for a lot of good reasons (insert Pearl Harbor here) and whatever comedy potential the idea once had was not well served by the expansion of his screen time.

The series improved a bit in its next and final season when the crew was shifted to the European front and began operating in Italy.  Season Four was a classic case of ""something so bad that it was almost good"", as there was a perverse charm to these surreal episodes which had absolutely no connection with reality.

The series also spawned two feature films, ""McHale's Navy"" (1964) and McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force"" (1965).

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1206230400,7,3140,5.007707129094412

I must have watched these episodes quite a few times now since I have bought the series set. Gavin McLeod as Seaman 'Happy' Haynes is gone but the on-going duel of wits between LTCOMDR McHale (Ernest Borgnine), ably (?) assisted by his stumbling Executive Officer, Ensign Parker (Tim Conway), and Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn), with HIS stumbling Aide Lt. Carpenter (Bob Hastings); are what makes each episode. The conniving and scheming goes on relentlessly, as McHale always comes out just ahead of his CO.

There are some 'bloopers' in some of the episodes and these are ones I have picked up, readers may have noticed others:

Episode 3.3 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad War-Captain Binghamton is involved in an 'accident' involving cream cakes, in the next scene his uniform is unsoiled.

Episode 3.4 McHale the Desk Commando-McHale looks out of the office window to see Gruber with one of his 'shindigs' underway, when the scene cuts to outside, the same windows appear to be shuttered closed.

Episode 3.6 Laugh Captain, Laugh-Captain Binghamton sees McHale and his men outside his office and walks out the door of his office without his hat on, the hat is seen sitting on top of his office safe; when the scene cuts to outside the office, Binghamton appears with the hat on his head.

Episode 3.8 The British Also Have Ensigns-Parker spills a pot of tea over Binghamton, when the scene returns, Binghamton's uniform is unsoiled. In another scene in this episode, there is a water jug sitting on a side table in Binghamton's office, when the scene changes to a close-up of McHale standing in front of the office safe, the water jug is now seen on top of the safe, behind his right ear. When the scene cuts back to a full view of everyone in the office, the water jug is now back on the side table. This blooper repeats itself three times until the scene changes.

Episode 3.13 Christy Goes Travelling-When the PR Captain talks to Parker (thinking he is Christy), he asks what is Christy's wife name and Parker responds, to which the PR Captain says ""I thought her name was Ruth?!"" In earlier Episodes, Christy's wife is named 'Gloria'. The aircraft in the scenes have post-war US markings of the USAF, which didn't occur until two years after the war (September 1947).

Episode 3.21 All Chiefs and No Indians-The 73 boat, with Ensign Parker at the helm, is seen with the forward 0.50 Cal machine gun set in the middle of the forward deck, in a later scene, the same gun is now mounted well forward, near the bow.

Episode 3.22 Pumpkin Takes Over-The aircraft that Parker assists Captain Binghamton's wife, Pumpkin, onto sports post-war USAF markings on it.

With the release of Season Four-set in Italy; the follow on has been to put the two movies onto DVD as a double set, so now McHale's Navy is complete. Several years after the series finished, Universal commenced to convert the Black and White episodes into colour. These were put out on Australian TV and I wonder if there is any plan to put the colour episodes onto DVD now?

THEN they can focus on getting rights to other obscure shows, great ones that nobody cares about, like SUPER PRESIDENT! thats such a killer, yet obscure cartoon. and then howabout the beatles cartoons? just give yoko ono a big iron boot, and get those beatles cartoons free from her CLAWS! then the barkleys.. theres so many great ones they can be putting energy towards releasing. thats how i feel, howabout all you other mchales navy and milton the monster show fans? find shout factory email address, bombard with complaints and ideas to stop this VOLUME lolligagging nonsense! ! !",1211673600,,1135,4.68

The only annoying thing is that on the first DVD in each season you have to watch a bunch of ads each time you use it.  There are 5 DVD's and this only applies to the first one.  So if I can't insert the DVD 5 min before I'm ready to watch I just watch something from discs 2-5.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

There are about 35 episodes so you are only paying about $1 per episode.",1209859200,,560,3.8260869565217392
3312395,1,B0012680AS,"While this is one good series,I am not happy at what I have learned and what I have to pass on to you all out there.
If you have read any of my past reviews on these sets you will know I have brought to your attention picture problems associated with them. Those problems,coupled with three more that appear in this set compelled me to finally write to Shout Factory to get to the bottom of things and they more than confirmed suspicions I have had about these sets.
Along with those past problems I have always noticed that when a scene fades in it is terribly out of focus until the film reaches its' proper illumination point. Come this Season Three set,two more problems were in evidence. First was on an ep early on,on Disc three when all figures suddenly develop severe jagged edges. It comes and goes until it finally disappears. This is something I have seen in conjunction with video tape. The second but most glaring problem occurs right off the bat on Disc One,ep#1. Throughout the ep there are numerous appearances of VIDEO TAPE LINES.Yes,I said video tape lines! They also appear to a lesser degree in other eps on Disc one but the first ep is the worst by far.
This did it for me,so I contacted Shout Factory and to their credit I got two responses from a David Landau and Melissa Boag. My questions to both and their subsequent answers were virtually the same so I'll give you an answer from both. To Mr. Landau I asked about the video lines I was seeing. His response:
""Hello
We used the best available masters given the nature of this release.
These little tape rolls were noticed and we were unable to find an
alternate source. Most of the time we can find something to replace
these, but in some instances we had to use a master with one or two
minor glitches to replace an episode that was unwatchable. Hope this
information helps. Thanks
-Shout!
Factory""

My second querie was to confirm then that indeed Shout factory had NOT gone back to the original film elements and had not remastered the series. Melissa Boags' response was:
""Hi Bob,
Yes you are correct in your assumption. I checked with production and
here is what I understand:

""What they are experiencing are brief tape rolls that exist on the video
source. I, along with NBC, sourced the best masters. Unfortunately,
there was no other source for ep 1.""

""Yes, this means these have not been remastered, but rather best source
available used. We felt it better to include these rather than cut down
the shows.""

I hope that clarifies your situation and explains the history. Please
let me know if you have any additional questions.
Regards, Melissa""

So there you have it folks. To satify yourselves,look on all of your three sets of Mchale's Navy and no where will you see the words ""Remastered"". However never in my wildest dreams did I ever think they would ever release something of such low credibility and standard. Tape lines!!?? Why this is the very same issue I took Hallmark video to task on in one of my earlier reviews of their release of a Laurel and Hardy compilation on DVD.
Melissa's answer that ""We felt it better to include these rather than cut down the shows"" makes it sound like we,as consumers,should be grateful that our hard earned money was plunked down to buy such junk. Sorry Melissa,I respect your answer and honesty,but this kind of product is the kind that should never see the light of day. It is Mickey Mouse,pure amateurism,and NO one should have to accept this. It is totally unforgiveable.
As an aside,it should be stated(to be fair)that Shout isn't the only company that releases product that hasn't been remastered from original source elements. Many times DVDS are released just using the available masters,which at the time the company deems ""acceptable"".You will also see later that a company will pull that release and issue a newly remastered one.""Acceptable"" is a relative term,depending on your point of view. Another point here is cost. Remastering,when done properly,does adds to the cost of a release. Priorities?
There you have it friends.
My recommendation,if it isn't obvious by now,is to AVOID this,past and future releases of Mchale's Navy at all costs. It has NOT been remastered and the video lines extant here in Season Three,along with the other problems I have listed here and in previous reviews,pretty much tell the entire sorry story by themselves. There is no way we should accept or encourage such releases by purchasing sub standard product such as this.
The responses by Mr. Landau and Ms. Boag of Shout are appreciated but they are just icing on a cake that is bad to begin with.",1208822400,12,4627,4.693349753694581

I don't have TOO much of a problem with that.  In fact, I rather like slapstick and Conway in general.  It does detract from the crew of the PT 73, though.  And another thing, unless he really screwed up, he'd been a JG by ""now"".

I have to admit, I do enjoy the episodes.  Yes, they are all ridiculous and zany, but that's what made for good television.  If you want reality of the Navy, your recruiter is just a phone call away (and I'm sure they're looking for their quota).  Ernest Borgnine still leads the way, in my book.
