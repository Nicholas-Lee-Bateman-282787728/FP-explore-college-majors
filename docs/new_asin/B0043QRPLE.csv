8415177,3,B0043QRPLE,"While there are some great performances here, I'd rather see the complete shows and none of the contemporary (2001) interviews with the announcers at the time.

8415179,5,B0043QRPLE,"I'm an avid music lover, and a child of the early 70s and 80s, and this particular collection is amazing.  Growing up in the US, I always wanted to see this show.  I think the closest thing we had was Midnight Special.  I chose this PAL UK version because a few great reviews pointed out that it was more comprehensive than the US DVDs, and my player is multi-region, and I'm so glad I did.  There is really interesting commentary footage between performances, by the various hosts throughout the years, and also a few performer commentaries.  I really enjoyed Jools Holland's segments.  So, if you're an anglophile, an audiophile and have a DVD player that is compatible, I recommend this set.",1362960000,3,694,4.694214876033058
