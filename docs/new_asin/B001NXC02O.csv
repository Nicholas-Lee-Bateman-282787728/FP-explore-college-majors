According to the standards of correct alignment today, she is obsolete.  It is not worth seeing it.  It is everything, but an advanced workout.",1381708800,,275,4.76595744680851
8328036,1,B001NXC02O,The instructors narration is awful. Often not saying anything when poses are changing nor saying pose. Hard to understand also.,1378080000,,127,5.4
8328037,5,B001NXC02O,"I have several other DVDs I really like produced by the same instructor, so I decided to also get this one.  For me, as a yoga student, I always look for an instructor who can inspire and motivate me while I am trying to replicate the same positions.  And this is exactly what I get with this DVD.  There is a very nice flow of movements and positions done with extreme flexibility.  And then there is the beautiful grace that only a ballerina can add to a difficult yoga routine to make it looking effortless.  Some occasional slight imperfections that may be noticed only give a human touch to the presentation.
Overall, this is an original approach that I enjoy and it helps me executing more challenging positions.  And in the same time it inspires me with the confidence that I can also do it.",1264809600,,798,4.468965517241379
8328038,1,B001NXC02O,"Avoid at all costs. I had read this DVD was awful and I wish I'd listened. I'm a yoga teacher and I own hundreds of audio and video routines, and this is the worst one I've ever encountered. It's not a matter of personal preference, either -- the problems with this production are so bad this DVD isn't even usable. Here's why:

1. There is no instruction. And I don't mean ""not enough instruction for beginners"" -- I mean NO instruction. Most of the time you have to be looking at the screen to see what she's doing. She doesn't narrate at all, and when she does, it's very flat and vague, such as ""now stretch this way."" It wouldn't help to preview the DVD or practice it, either. Her transitions and hold times are COMPLETELY random.

2. Her form is absolutely awful. I would hate for someone to use this DVD and try to emulate her. An example: She flares her elbows to the side on chaturanga, sinks between her shoulderblades, sags in her lower back, and scrunches her shoulders up around her ears (for example), all the things people do when they aren't strong enough for the sequence.

3. She'll do a sequence on one side and do something totally different on the other side.

4. She claims to be a student of Sri Dharma Mittra, but there is no way Dharma Mittra would place his seal of approval on this. In no way does this resemble his teaching or any actual teaching. She probably took a crowded weekend class from him and from Andrey Lappa and then name-dropped to sell this DVD. I question whether she's even an actual yoga teacher, which brings me to #5...

5. This is not an advanced DVD. She herself can bend deeply in her demonstrations. She comes across as a ballerina who walked into a yoga class already very flexible and assumed she was not only an automatically advanced student, but an instant teacher. This proves anybody can put out a DVD if the money is there. I'm sure she's a wonderful dancer, but she should stick with dancing.

The impression this DVD gives is this: She was doing a yoga demonstration in her living room one day after watching a Dharma Mittra video, and her ballet dancer friends decided to grab a video camera and their Casio keyboard -- put it on ""demo"" loop -- and make a DVD. Truly, it is that bad.",1262995200,8,2247,4.415458937198068
