5344268,2,B009KCS97A,"Good views of German troops attacking trenches, and fighting British tanks. The screen play is bad. AQWF is a better film even though it is a Talkie era film. Fine for renting",1408579200,5,175,4.5
5344269,4,B009KCS97A,Excellent stuff - but you'll notice the Nazi prop[agenda effort being included within it by the end. (read the history of the making of this movie.) Well worth watching if you are into REALISTIC WW1 combat scenes!,1391558400,4,213,4.783783783783784
5344270,5,B009KCS97A,"This is a classic propaganda movie, and I enjoyed seeing it.  I studied WWII propaganda in college, many years ago, and have been on the lookout for wartime movies from both sides with an eye towards keeping that interest alive.  Most of these old wartime Nazi movies I have never seen.  I've enjoyed the recent release of many of them, like ""Stuka"", and look forward to the possible release of some Japanese movies, too.",1385856000,8,421,4.662162162162162
5344271,1,B009KCS97A,Towards the end of the movie it just would not play.  I think there must be problems with its manufacturing cause it was brand new.  This is my first opportunity to comment..Maybe they will send me a new one and I will be happy if that one [lays all the way thru.,1385856000,2,263,4.038461538461538
8542425,3,B009KCS97A,"To understand STOSSTRUPP 1917, it is first necessary to mention WESTFRONT 1918, the movie that this one was largely made to refute.

In 1930, during the closing days of the Weimar Republic, G.W. Pabst directed ""Westfront,"" a blistering and bitter antiwar film set in the last year of the Great War. It followed four doomed German infantrymen during a week of their lives -- the last week, as it turned out, for most of them, and was unsparing it its depiction of the brutal fighting up front and the chaos, hunger and defeatism that was rampant back home. Four years later, when the Nazis were in power in Germany, the ardent Nazi Hans Zberlein directed this ""answer"" to Pabst antiwar screed. Set one year earlier, it was meant to present the Great War in a context more fitting with Zberlein's personal experiences in it (he was a highly decorated veteran of Verdun, and wrote a book about his experiences called ""Faith in Germany,"" whose forward was penned by none other than Adolf Hitler), and with the Nazis views on warfare generally. In many ways, the movies are actually very similar: both feature a ""fractured narrative"" (meaning many characters with no clear ""star"") and both present the war as a series of vignettes rather than a ""story"" (there is no actual plot to either film). Both are equally unsparing in their depiction of combat and shot with a high degree of technical ability. The big difference is simply the level of enthusiasm the soldiers have for fighting. In one sequence, for example, the Germans are attacked by many British tanks. At first bullied and terrorized, they quickly develop methods of combating the tanks and hunting them become a sort of ""sport"" conducted with flaming barrels of explosive. In another sequence, a dying German soldier asks his friend pathetically if ""this war is just a swindle, like everyone says?"" His comrade gives him a touching speech assuring him that the cause is noble and the war honorable and just.

""Stoss"" in German means ""shock"" and therefore the title translates to SHOCK TROOP 1917. German shock troops were highly able trench fighters picked for their daring and skill in close-quarters battle, and used to capture enemy trenches via rapid, bold rushes. They regarded themselves as a ruthless elite, contemptuous of death, and many of them joined the so-called Free Corps after the war, to help fight communist rebels; from there, many more (like Zberlein himself) joined the Nazi Party. It's pretty clear that Zberlein was attempting to show the seed of Nazi power in the toughness and ferocity of the shock troops, and in that and other senses this movie is a work of propaganda. While it is not precisely pro-war -- it really does show some hideous sides of battle, i.e. gas attacks, drumfires of shells, men dying in pain, etc. -- it is most definitely not antiwar and was part of a systematic attempt by the Nazis to recast WW1 in a way more in congruity with their ideology, and in Zberlein's case, with his own personal memories of battle.

As entertainment, I'd give this movie a C+/B-. The lack of a plot, and of any character development, and the bombastic subtext of the message make it somewhat of a disappointment. It is better enjoyed in small snatches for its combat sequences than as a movie in its totality. But its valuable as documentary evidence of how the Nazis saw the past war, and how they imagined the war to come.",1527379200,,3412,4.779661016949152

8542427,2,B009KCS97A,"Okay, finally got this one and got the time to watch it all the way through - several times in fact.  I'm a military history fanatic and have a lot of books on military history, tons of movies, and I collect militaria.  I used to do WWII reenacting and was a founding member of the National WWII Museum in New Orleans - and finally, my adopted grandfather was German and served in the Luftwaffe.  Obviously, I WANTED to like this movie.  Honestly, it's an absolutely terrible movie - even by the standards of the time in which it was made.  Comparing this movie to All Quiet on the Western Front is akin to comparing Forrest Gump to Sharknado.  It really is that bad.

The uniforms and equipment used in the movie is fantastic - wondered where they got so much WWI hardware, British especially, at that time to make this movie.  They used at least two British WWI tanks making the movie as well, so, very curious how the fledgling Third Reich managed to find two running versions when this was done.  The screen play, however, is just terrible - even as propaganda it's unbearably bad to watch.  There's basically one hour and forty minutes of annoying whistling shell noises and explosions, over and over again, monotonously, from beginning to end.  There is very little dialogue in this movie, and absolutely no character development whatsoever.  You can watch it straight through and you'll know nothing about any person in it, and honestly, even at the end you'll be asking yourself, ""Have I ever seen that guy before?""  It honestly only has about four ""main"" characters, none of whom have any notable lines or screen time.

There was a lot of time spent making the trenches look realistic and the debris and filth of WWI look realistic, but, the acting is horrible, there is (no kidding) no story to this movie whatsoever except the message at the end that the entire German war effort was stabbed in the back by politicians back at home, and the movie is just painfully bad.  I collect WWI German camo helmets for pity's sake, and I genuinely really didn't like this movie at all.  It's absolutely horrid.

There are far better and more realistic films about WWI now on the market - somebody still needs to do a major big screen flick on the Somme, but AQWF is still hands-down the definitive movie on the subject (both versions).  Even worse, this movie doesn't stick to the ""Storm Trooper"" theme it starts with and rambles all over the place to German soldiers in general, apparently trying to focus on what is supposed to be one storm trooper squad.  ALSO - the subtitles in this version make very little sense in a LOT of places.  Whoever did the translation work for this failed miserably, but I can understand why.  I speak some German as well, and this is why I watched it twice, I couldn't understand 3/4ths of what was being said.  The sound quality is very bad and it sounds like they were recorded speaking into a soup can with a string at the end of it.

It's interesting to watch clips of it online, but I CANNOT recommend this one, not even for the propaganda piece it was intended to be or for its historical context - it's just plain painful to watch and makes absolutely no sense.",1518566400,,3203,4.551483420593368

8542429,5,B009KCS97A,"Astounding movie!! This has aged really well, and you feel like you're stuck in the trenches with them. Great to see a film with those early tanks in it too. Definately on a par with ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" and other greats.",1482451200,3,233,4.318181818181818
8542430,5,B009KCS97A,"German propaganda straight from Goebbels' ministry.  Hitler's friend and minister of propaganda fancied himself a movie mogul.  He produced a lot of offensive crap, but this one, showing the conditions on the Western Front in WW I is extremely well done.  The tense, often claustrophobic conditions of trench warfare were well depicted, as well as the futility of bloody, wasteful frontal assaults made for little or no game.  Comparable in many aspects to Milestone's ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" but lacks much of the personal stories, background and character interaction that made ""All Quiet..."" The classic it is.

Well, worth the watching for its historical value, if nothing else.  Could have been a classic but for its origins.",1471910400,5,740,5.176470588235294

8542432,4,B009KCS97A,Excellent film on what it was like in 1917 in the trenches and how awful it was to storm trenches as well as forts. One must view this film in its historic context as it was made by the Nazis for propaganda purposes albeit it was fairly accurate in its presentations.,1439251200,8,267,4.254901960784314
8542433,5,B009KCS97A,"Very well done film in terms of historical accurate uniforms and battlefield tactics. Also of note is the not so subtle ""stab in the back"" message embraced by National Socialists after the war.",1424649600,6,193,4.878787878787879
8542434,3,B009KCS97A,"I personally liked this movie. However it became somewhat repetitious, regarding the battle scenes and the characters were not well developed, however for a movie of the times, it is well worth a look.",1421193600,5,201,4.9411764705882355
