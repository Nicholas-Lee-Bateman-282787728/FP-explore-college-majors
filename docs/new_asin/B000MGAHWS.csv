8168407,4,B000MGAHWS,Really enjoyed this DVD. Used on days when I had energy and was willing to sweat. Terrific instructor. Love the extras. Good music. Pleasing set.,1253318400,,145,4.84
8168408,5,B000MGAHWS,"I love this workout. In fact, I am going to order a copy of the DVD. I originally downloaded it from an exercise site but I want to have my own hard copy. I am not pregnant. I have no children (I wish). However, I am in my mid 30's and wanted to incorporate yoga into my exercise routine. I've tried so many yoga DVD's (too long, too hard, too complicated, too easy) but when I saw a preview of this dvd on youtube, I knew it was for me even though I wasn't pregnant. I like to do workouts that can be done through all phases of life. For example, what I do at 35, I want to keep doing at 75. If in fact I am blessed with a pregnancy, I will not have to change my routine of Leslie Sansone walking and this yoga DVD. My flexibility has improved, I have a stronger core and I love the breath work to help relieve stress. Instead of focusing on a baby living inside of me, I focus on Jesus and the Holy Spirit instead. I am not interested in being a pretzel or performing amazing flexibility poses but I want to be strong and healthy.",1228608000,,1032,3.9903381642512077
8168409,5,B000MGAHWS,"I have been practicing yoga for 5 years and found it difficult to keep up with my regular ashtanga routine when I was pregnant. Andrea's Fitmom yoga vibe video allowed me to not only keep in shape while pregnant, but also physically and mentally ready for the birth of my second child. Also, the interview and Q&A session with Dr. Cram (OBGYN) helped answer some of my questions (yes, even as I second time mom, I had questions) and eased the anxiety of my upcoming birth. Thank you!",1168128000,2,483,4.5
