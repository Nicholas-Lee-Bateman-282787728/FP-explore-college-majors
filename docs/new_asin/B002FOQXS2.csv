8369362,5,B002FOQXS2,"If you love over the top funny you will love The Wallflower. It tells the story 4 beautiful boys' adventures while trying to turn their landlady's niece into a proper young lady. There is only one problem with this- the niece, is not a typical girl by ANY means. Loving severely gory movies, blood and medical mannequins, she cannot deal with ""radiant creatures"" and constantly gets nosebleeds just being around them. the amount of over the topness could be sickening to some, but it never really gets old to me. If you love super comical Anime, this one is a good pick to see.",1376784000,,577,4.5576923076923075
8369363,5,B002FOQXS2,"Four boys must turn a girl into a refined lady, except that she believes that she's ugly -- and I mean gargoyle ugly. Oh, and their rent is on the line. Yeah, ""Wallflower: The Complete Collection"" sounds kind of generic at first. But while it takes a little while to get used to the characters, this hilarious, surreal anime takes off like a nosebleeding rocket after the first few episodes.

Four staggeringly beautiful teenage boys -- bookish Takanaga, childlike Yuki, brash Kyohei and flirtatious Ranmaru -- are living in a luxurious mansion. One day their landlady offers them a deal: if they can turn her niece Sunako into a refined lady, their living expenses will be completely free. Of course, they accept.

Then they actually MEET Sunako. She has bad hair/skin/clothes/social skills, and spends all her time alone in a dark bedroom, watching horror movies and talking to her biology models. And she's convinced that she'll melt if she sees the ""creatures of light,"" aka the boys.

But with their living expenses on the line, the boys valiantly try to turn Sunako into the perfect lady. Instead, they end up enmeshed with illegal clubs, haunted houses, arrogant photographers, Halloween, nabe and a kotatsu, math tutoring, magic mushrooms, pirate ghosts, a day at a spa for the girls, Sunako's eccentric parents, a Satanic shopkeeper cult, a thuggish suitor, and a trip to the hot springs where Sunako and the boys are faced with a gruesome murder...

The Pygmalion-esque plot of ""The Wallflower"" is something that's been done thousands of times before. But this anime spices up its story by being hilarious, frenetic and sometimes insane -- there's a squad of insane ""goth loli sisters"" (who sprout wheels when needed), ""Road To Womanhood"" tutorials, and the EPIC ELEMENTAL PING-PONG GAME OF DEATH!

The first couple episodes are a little rough, and at first the characters are kind of flat. But then the writers settle into a comfortable rhythm -- the dialogue is weird (""Stupid Adam! Stupid Eve! Stupid DNA! Stupid Pithecanthropus!""), there are a lot of funny pokes at anime conventions (how many nosebleeds can Sunako have?!). Some of the episodes are introduced by ""Hiroshi,"" an anatomical model missing his internal organs. The one problem is that a few of the jokes don't really translate for American viewers -- who are those tanned girls with the sharp nails?

And the characters start out a little two-dimensional (Bookworm, Flirt, Jerk, Doom'n'gloom Girl) but are gradually fleshed out over time -- Kyohei seems like a jerk at first, but has a good heart underneath it all; Takanaga is mature in all ways but romance; Ranmaru is flirty but rather naive; and Yuki is adorably childlike. And Sunako seems very weird and antisocial at first, but she turns out to be nice if sinister. And, of course, she can kick butt.

Small note on the English voice actors: at first I didn't think they fit the characters, especially Josh Grelle as Kyohei and Vic Mignogna as Takanaga. But after a few episodes the actors settle nicely into their roles, especially Hannah Alcorn and her scratchy, slightly wild voice.

""The Wallflower: Complete Collection"" sounds like yet another glorified makeover show, but instead it's a hilarious, unabashedly weird little anime. Hiroshi here...",1283212800,,3285,5.014678899082568
8369364,2,B002FOQXS2,"I thought this would be an adorable story like Ouran High School Host Club but all they do is yell at each other and my ears couldn't take it anymore, it was REALLY annoying...",1280016000,4,176,4.205882352941177
8369365,5,B002FOQXS2,"It's a combination of Paradise Kiss, Ouran High School Host Club, Karin, Super Gals, Gokusen, & Hare + Guu.

The main character is a bipolar schizophrenic with Body Dysmorphia Disorder who switches back & forth between an emo goth & a stark raving b**ch. That alone was enough to get me to watch this. As a bonus, we get 3 beautiful men & one that looks like a chick...all of them are sorta terrified of her & her violent outbutst & her macabre interests. She is ""ugly"" to everyone in the show, only the audience sees her as beautiful...when she's not in chibi-form.

*SPOILERS AHOY!*

There's one boy obviously ment to play the love interest; the token idiot blonde. Rather than be her knight in shining armor, she ususally has to rescue him, & he gets kidnapped a lot. He also gets stalked & sexually harrassed by both men & women. On top of that, the other boys don't seem to have any romantic interest in her; two are already spoken for.

The boys' mission is to make their landlord's niece into a refined lady, so she's their pet project. Despite everything trying to force Sunako (the main girl) & Kyouhei (the dumb blonde) into coupledom, the two continue to barely tollerate eachother; a formula Kareshi Kanojo should have gone with.

In episode 14, she gets high on mushrooms & temporarily becomes a girly-girl. At first the boys are delighted because she's no longer creepy, she's sweet, & their landlady would grant them free rent. In less than a day, all of them, especially Kyouhei, realize that her bad cooking skills aren't the only thing they dislike about the new her & they try to get her back to her freaky old self.

In the end, the plan to make her into a refined lady is completely abandoned, everyone accepts her for the way she is, & Kyouhei & Sunako never hook up. He likes her as a friend, but she is too much like his mother, whom he swore he'd never see again. Sanako likes Kyouhei as a friend, but is uncomfortable with his attractiveness, more in a turned-off way.

So in the end, I would categorize this as antishoujo, antiharem, somewhat antiromance, & I totally recommend you try the other animes I mentioned in the first paragraph.",1265155200,,2165,4.5501285347043705
8369366,5,B002FOQXS2,"The Wallflower starts off with four bishounen boys that are living in a big mansion. One day, when their landlady requests of them to turn her niece into a lady for free rent, of course, they agree. But they didn't know that the niece, Sunako Nakahara, was obsessed with everything creepy and scary. Her best friend is an anatomical figure!  Not only that, but she gets major nosebleeds whenever she sees anyone who is ""dazzlingly bright"". The boys have to deal with the scary Sunako while still trying to turn her into a lady. The problem with Sunako is that when she was in middle school, a boy she really like called her ugly. So she gave up trying to be girly and gave in to the darkness.

This anime is completely hilarious. The voice actors did an amazing job on expressing emotions through the voices, and the characters are so . . . real. Some of the episodes are just completely eccentric, like episode 15, where the group goes to an island where Sunako gets possessed by a ghost, and they all get hallucinations on what they really want to see. There's nothing like The Wallflower to make you feel better when you're feeling down, or when you have little self-confidence.

The only con is that this anime ended too soon for me. There should have been more to it than just 25 episodes. The manga goes way ahead of the anime, and it never says what ever happens to Sunako and Kyohei.",1257897600,2,1391,4.468503937007874
8369367,4,B002FOQXS2,"From the director of ""Excel Saga"" comes the anime ""THE WALLFLOWER""  aka ""Yamatonadeshiko Shichihenge"" which will satisfy every Bishonen/J-Rock fan out there.

The popular 25-episode anime is based on the manga series by Hayakawa Tomoko and serialized in ""Bessatsu Friend"" in Japan and by Del Rey Manga in the US and was originally released through ADV Films has its complete collection released on DVD courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

The story revolves around 4 guys - the dark haired Oda Takenaga, the short hair blonde Toyama Yuki, the red head flirt Morii Ranmaru and the leader of the group, the tough but handsome blonde Kyohei Takano.

The four men are pretty boys that the girls gush over and happen to live in a lavish mansion courtesy of the Landlady who has given the men a mission.  The goal is to make the Landlady's niece, Sunako, to an elegant lady. If they managed to, they get free rent. If they don't, they will have to pay three times the amount to live there.

Of course, the guys want to make sure they succeed and feel that there should be no problem... that is until they meet Sunako. A girl who doesn't dress all that well. She wears a stained sweatshirt, amoeba-like design dress and bad tennis shoes. Her bangs are so long that it covers the face and she happens to be scary.  In fact, she's so creepy that her friends are two anatomy demonstration dummies and a skeleton.

Why Sunako is like this stems from a past guy that she liked and told her straight out that he would never date someone so ugly.  Being devastated, she has regressed for years and lives in her bedroom and pretty much has succumb to the darkness.

So, Sunako has become a recluse and totally into the weirdest things and her best friend is Hiroshi, anatomic model used to show the guts and innards of a human being. Adding to her creepiness, she digs really dark and scary things and she can't take how these radiant guys are trying to make her beautiful. In fact, she gets creepy thoughts of how to kill the guys but even the thought of them gives her a nosebleed.

The main characters of ""The Wallflower"" are:

  * Sunako Nakahara - The creepy girl who has lived in darkness after being told by a guy she liked that he doesn't go for ugly girls.  Since then, she has let herself go in darkness until her aunt has four radiant guys who will live with her to change her.  Her best friends are anatomical dummies and a skeleton.  She is often shown as this short creepy girl but there are times when her beautiful side is shown and she is as tall as the other guys.  Talented in cooking but has low self-esteem and is anti-social.
  * Kyouhei Takano - The leader of the guys.  Most popular, most attractive, most athletic and great at fighting and getting attention for his looks. And loves Sunako's cooking and is often the person who has reached out to Sunako, even kissing her.  The blonde member of the group.
  * Takenaga Oda - Serious and intelligent and seems to be unphased by Sunako at times.  Despite coming from a wealthy family, the pressure from his family has him living away from them and with the other guys.  Has a relationship (which he has a hard time admitting to) with Noi. The black haired member of the group.
  * Ranmaru Morii - The playboy. Comes from a family of wealthy hotel owners and loves older women.  Tries to use his charm to help Sunako.  The red-haired member of the group.
  * Yukinojo ""Yuki"" Toyama - The youngest of the guys.  Kind-hearted and always willing to help Sunako.  But because he looks like effeminate, he hates that, especially when people think of him as a girl or weak.  The short-haired blonde member of the group.
  * Naie ""Noi"" Kasahara - The often sixth member of the group.  The most popular/beautiful girl in school who is in love with Takenga Oda and believes that she is his girlfriend.

VIDEO & AUDIO QUALITY:

""The Wallflower"" is presented in 4:3 format.  The animation is pretty cool as it goes back and forth from serious to something humorous. For example, with Sunako, when she has this creep side to her, she's shown as a girl with no eyes, but then sometimes shown as a girl with beautiful eyes and then when she goes crazy over seeing Kyohei, she gets these ""Crayon Shin Chan"" looking eyes.

Another example shows the guys when they are creeped out about Sunako, they turn into white pale figures like ghosts. It's a very interesting take on how the series showcases the main characters in different situations.

I watched the series both in English and Japanese and both voice work are very cool and like both equally the same. The English dub is in English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound and the Japanese audio track is in stereo. But both soundtracks are well done.  And it's one of the few anime series where I absolutely loved the English dialogue much more than the Japanese.  Mainly because the English vocal talent give each character its own identity and Hannah Alcorn does a great Sunako!

Subtitles are only in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Wallflower - The Complete Series"" comes with only the textless opening and ending animation plus FUNimation trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

All in all, I found ""THE WALLFLOWER"" to be stylishly vibrant, hilarious, stylishly cool and unique.

The characters are quite interesting and are different from the swashbuckling, adventurous Final Fantasy-esque pretty boys and I want to make it clear right away that this is not a gay anime.  ""The Wallflower"" is an interesting take on the bishonen/J-Rock stylish guys.  It's actually interesting because the high school, the girls are just so crazy over these guys and they just can't figure out why they hang out with such a creepy girl.  It's hilarious to see how the guys react to Sunako but how caring they are towards her.  And of course, how she behaves around them.

One of the coolest things about this anime is that the creator, Hayakawa Tomoko is a fan of J-Rock artist Kiyoharu (formerly of the band KUROYUME) and Kiyoharu sings the opening and ending theme for the series. As a fan of Japanese rock music and as a guy who happens to dig the style, I felt it was very cool to see an anime like this. It's very different and unique and quite humorous to watch because I have friends who are ""pretty boys"" who always try to remake their girlfriends or friends in general and try to make them stylish.

All in all, ""THE WALLFLOWER"" is not an anime that tries to showcase a quirkiness or take a dramatic turn ala ""Hana Yori no Dango"".  If anything, the anime series is more on the humorous side and rarely becomes a drama.  If anything, the series focuses on trying to help Sunako and we learn more about these five characters over the course of the series.

As mentioned, the series is well-acted and both English and Japanese audio tracks are well done.  The English audio track is very good and again, this is coming from a guy who tends to prefer watching anime in Japanese.  I absolutely dig the character designs and the animation and again, definitely one of those rare anime series out there.

So, I'm stoked to see something unique and different. Not sure if the casual anime fan, especially the guys would dig an anime about pretty boys and them trying their best to help out a creepy girl (who is not exactly creepy and when you see her normal, Sunako's actually quite cute and you realize how much of those negative thoughts are just in her head). But I think those who are used to watching bishonen men or fan of J-Rock or visual kei may take a high interest in an anime like ""The Wallflower"".  It's actually a very entertaining series and for the most part, an entertaining and solid anime series!

Overall, ""The Wallflower"" is an anime series that is definitely worth recommending!",1254355200,20,10701,4.447707367336425
8369368,4,B002FOQXS2,"Quick question- exactly what is a wallflower?  Answer: One who does not participate in activity at a social event due to shyness, unpopularity or a combination of the two. The origin of this figurative sense dates way back to 1820 in reference to unpartnered women sitting along the wall at a dance in a work by Mrs. Campbell Praed entitled County Ball. Although originally used to describe women at dances, these days the term can just as easily be applied to men as well and used in situations beyond just a ballroom.  That's a good thing because in this context, we're talking about a psychotic teenage chick and modern day ugly duckling saga.  But before we get ahead of ourselves here, let's take a look at the hard facts.

Originally released by ADV Films, Funimation has recently acquired the rights to the show and has wasted little time in getting a Complete Series release out to the public. Coming in at a total runtime of 625 minutes, the Wallflower the Complete Series spans 4 discs (25 episodes) and comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within a cardboard slipcase.

The show wears an appropriate TV 14 rating thanks to some drug innuendos, a little disturbing imagery (hallucinations and supernatural), and young adult themes.  Nudity, graphic violence, or obscene language is pretty much nonexistent here.

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the option of original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (5.1 Dolby Surround) and English subtitles available under either language choice.

Extras are limited to clean opening and closing themes and a host of Funimation trailers.

The story could best be summarized like this: Four handsome and popular teenage guys find themselves in a bit of a predicament: their landlord has agreed to allow them to live rent-free for life if they are willing to spend time with her slightly eschew niece Sunako, who is coming to live with them in the house, in effort to convert her into a ""proper lady"". The catch is that if they fail, their rent triples (be thankful this isn't legal here in the US).

Next thing the guys know, the exceedingly depressed, creepy, and antisocial Sunako shows up on the scene and makes it clear that she would rather brood in her bedroom than to have anything to do with the guys, who she calls ""Creatures of Light"".

Like you may have imagined, the poor girl has developed a wicked complex about being ugly and society's judgmental ways have forced her to retreat to the dark side, a slightly supernatural realm of reclusive-ness.  Suffice to say, the guys have their hands full.

The pacing is brisk and clean with many opportunities to draw laughs.  The guys already had full schedules thanks to the habit of women everywhere swooning to them but it's the goth-queen Sunako who steals the show.  In addition to her overtones, wardrobe, and dialog, her favorite sidekick just so happens to be an anatomical dummy named Pedro.  Comedic overreaction happens frequently early on but weans off in the later installments as the plots become more conflict-oriented.

Soundwork is pretty slick throughout with metal-inspired guitar riffs melding with upbeat jazzy numbers, and eerie low-tones when the situation calls for them.  It may sound like a hodgepodge of musical styles but it works on the whole thanks to the ever-changing flavors of the story.

As has been the case with many of the ADV Films/ Funimation properties of late, the vocal work is tight in either incarnation.  The English version is slightly less amusing as the original Japanese but the jokes are pretty universally appealing and hence aren't lost in translation.

In all this is but another unique anime title that would probably have been lost to the cracks of the industry if not for Funimation's rejuvenation/ decision to release the entire series as a single and complete collection.  Best of all the price of the complete collection is actually a little less than each of the individual season sets were going for.  It's tough not to get excited about that!",1252022400,43,4040,4.874269005847953
