8448990,5,B00004WJOH,This documentary that features the music of Cuba beats its way through the entire process by which the world renowned Cuban cigar is produced from seedling to final boxed cigars. This is an education but also a great musical experience. If you love Afro-Cuban Jazz and modern Latin fusion beats this is a beautiful ride.,1379203200,,320,4.836363636363636
