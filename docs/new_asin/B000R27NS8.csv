8198389,4,B000R27NS8,"Due to the cost of hiring a professional vocal instructor and my full time work schedule, I have not had any vocal lessons.  I decided to try this program and have been reaping the benefits ever since.  I have watched vocal tips on-line but decided that purchasing the dvd would be best.  I enjoyed and improved a lot of my vocals with the exercises and warm ups.  Not only am I enjoying the vocal program I am also enjoying the interviews and tips.  I did experience inconsistent volume change and it was kind of annoying after awhile.  Overall, Great Program.",1294963200,3,561,4.56
