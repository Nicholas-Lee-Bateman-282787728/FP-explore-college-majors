3950481,5,B002M2T1UO,"The Shield is one of those shows that rips you in on the first episode and keeps you coming back again and again. I can't watch TV on Tuesday nights in the Fall without thinking about The Shield. If you're a fan of dark and gritty shows this is the cat's meow. From the very first episode, you are forced to come to odds with Detective Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) the surprisingly likeable anti-hero of the show. Set in the fictional Barn district of LA, it is based around a corrupt gang-task force unit called the Strike Team.

Season One: The first episode is a gut shot. You spend the rest of the season trying to figure out how to like an anti-hero so dark you can't even begin to rationalize his deplorable actions. The deeply disturbing relationship between Captain Aceveda (Benito Martinez) and Mackey's Strike Team forms. Best season of the show, the show and Chiklis definitely earned their Golden Globes. 10/10

Season Two: The second season introduces a wider scope of bad guys for the Strike Team to deal with. It really builds on the anticillary characters and solidifies Mackey's survival instinct and Shane Vendrell's (Walton Goggins) bone-headed nature. The actions of the team in this season cast shockwaves that will last through out the course of the series.  9/10

Season Three: A slower season that deals with the conscience of the Strike Team in the aftermath of a major heist. The once tight family disengrates as the members struggle internally with how to handle their actions. Elsewhere in the Barn, Detective Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder) begins to make a tustle for reform while Detective ""Dutch"" Wagenbach (Jay Karnes)takes a disturbing turn into darkness. 8/10

Season Four: With the Strike Team seperated things take interesting paths. Strike Team members Lem, Mackey, and Gardocki try to keep things clean, while Vendrell and his new partner continue the old ways. Vendrell doesn't have the instincts and smarts of Mackey and soon winds up over his head in the employ of drug dealer Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson). Glenn Close joins the cast as Captain Monica Rawling. A fast paced season that leaves you questioning just who to trust. 9/10

Season Five: In one of the most powerful seasons, IA agent Jon Kavanaugh (Forest Whitaker) enters the Barn. Tasked with taking down Mackey, Kavanaugh tears the already fractured Strike Team apart with evidence against Lem. Kavanaugh is Mackey's equal and the two square off constantly to destroy each other. The season finale is dark and disturbing leaving a tremendous aftermath that shatters the already tenenous Strike Team. 10/10

Season Six: After the events of the season five finale, Vic is on the warpath. With one hand he is vengance bound, on the other he is trying to save his career as brass tries to force him into retirment. Vandrell continues to seperate himself from the rest of the Strike Team as he falls in with the Armenian Mob and struggles with internal guilt. Wyms now promoted to the captain of the Barn is deadset on saving it from itself and all those that stand in its way.  7/10

Season Seven: The final season. Vic still set on vengance finally has a true target, while Vandrell goes entirely rogue on the lamb. Wyms and Dutch race against time to finally take down Mackey, while Gardocki and himself go darker than ever - hunting one of their own. Season Seven pits Vic against everyone he loves and tests his survival instinct to its core. In the end, it is a chilling season that should have earned Emmy nods for Michael Chiklis and Walter Goggins. 10/10

The series has its highs and lows, but on a whole remains a powerful piece and one of the best cop shows ever. This a series I've watched over and over again in marathon sessions. I owned all but the final season on DVD and have since given them away when word of the complete series finally came around.

This is a must have DVD collection and my favorite TV show of all time.",1257206400,27,3944,4.7430656934306565

I updated it to the latest version, and now I have ""theater"" sound/visual effects for my widescreen monitor.

I ordered this on a Wednesday, and folks, it showed up on my doorstep 3 days later (and I didn't even ask for expedited). I'm beyond impressed with the seller and Amazon!

This is one of those those things that if you don't need it, it really doesn't matter, but if you do need it then it pretty much ruins the experience. For some bizarre reason Season 7--and ONLY Season 7--lacks subtitles. I watched this series with my father who is quite hard of hearing.

People can talk about shows like Breaking Bad, The Wire, etc, but this show is king, and the only reason it did not have a larger following is because of the time it aired, and network that it was released on as cable channels were not known for quality original programming like they are now. Everyone should watch this show.

I doubt there are many viewers who have not seen or are at least not aware of The Shield.  This is truly 'gritty' television.  I think of it as Hill Street Blues on crack.  The ensemble cast is made up of truly great actors in roles that are believable and lifelike.  Best yet, these actors are perfectly suited for the characters they portray.  When watching these episodes you aren't watching actors on a show, you are watching these ""people"" interact in believable situations.

The actual disc storage is the problem.  This is a book like unit with two large spindles.  Discs are stacked on top of each other with no barrier in between.  The potential for problems come in the form of like likelihood of disc scratches and the requirement to handles discs unneeded in order to select one desired buried under the others.",1506816000,4,1067,5.49079754601227

3950510,5,B002M2T1UO,"Having never watched any of this show on it's initial run, I was a little apprehensive about this purchase due to 2 things.

1. Someone told me they found the series unrealistic.
2. There were complaints here about the newer formatted packaging.

As for the 1st apprehension, although based on a true story, if the scripts followed every detail to letter of what happened, I'm guessing it would have made for a pretty boring series. Heck, we probably wouldn't even be pondering such details, because there's a strong chance the show would never have seen airtime, let alone an eventual release as a complete series box set.

Please do not misconstrue this as a slight to the original people that lived it and felt the pain involved; real life hard work is just that, and includes tragedies that we will (hopefully) never experience.

But we do now have access to this excellent series based on that story and I do love ARMCHAIR ACTION, especially when mixed with gut-wrenching, edge-of-the-seat drama with a helpful (more often than not inappropriate) sprinkling of humor mixed into the recipe. The Shield: The Complete Collection delivered all that and more.

I won't go into every episode, but I will say that this is not only a heavily thought-out & emotion-provoking series, but also well acted by the revolving cast of regular characters as well as the strategic choices of well-known actors.

I had never been a fan of Glenn Close before, so I didn't find it the least bit compelling that she was a part of this series, but she is so great in this that I didn't want to see her leave. Forrest Whitaker storms through his role like an irritant, electrifying hurricane. His acting in this role is creepy and revolting, and he's one of the good guys - heh! Incredible stuff.

Is it over the top? Way so. Is it unrealistic? Yeah, at times, but also VERY realistically gritty and one of those shows that I was glad to have waited to own the entire series because I could not stop watching it. I am now planning a re-watch, but have to negotiate an open period of time to do so (a good television series is worth it, but it can be a maneuver getting proper sleep while allowing oneself to be hypnotized by the episode-to-episode seduction).

The packaging? The DVDs are stacked on a center hub. Personally, I've never found this to be a problem, and is way more preferred than having discs stored tightly wedged in those thick cardboard wallet sleeves like some box sets, causing scratches almost immediately upon removal.

So I say, stack 'em high, whether or not it keeps the price down, the bottom line is I have never had a disc freeze or skip due to this type of storage.

Add in Amazon's top-shelf Packaging & Shipping Department, and we equal a successful purchase all around. Since I began to shop on Amazon, I  have always felt that their Employees do not get enough credit in reviews for all the hard work they put into getting these items delivered safely to our doors. I guess it's easy enough for some to take that for granted, but considering the pricing and convenience of this service, I, for one, am grateful for all that they do. This brick of a Box Set now sits proudly on my shelf awaiting it's next watch due to their excellent handling of the merchandise and the preparation to ensure that it arrived in absolutely New condition. Thank you!",1501113600,,3362,4.624161073825503
3950511,3,B002M2T1UO,"Don't let the 3-star score fool you, the series itself is fantastic and one of the best ever made. The packaging on the other hand is one of the absolute worst I've ever seen.

All discs are split into two trays. Even worse they are stacked on top of each other. This makes it a hassle to get to what ever disc you're wanting to watch as well as also makes it fairly easy to scratch them.

One of the trays detached from my package due to the weight of the discs. To top it off the discs don't stay in place when standing the case vertically unless you keep the cheap cardboard inserts placed on top if the stack.

If youreyou're on a budget then this is a great value, just don't expect quality. If you can afford to spend a little more then buy the individual seasons, even if ut means buying them used.",1500508800,,805,4.147435897435898

3950515,3,B002M2T1UO,"I like the story line but the acting and writing leave a lot to be desired.  I refer to it as comic book type show.  The actors can do whatever they like with no consequences.  In one scene, he main character , played by Michael Chiklis puts on a pair of sun glasses and a blue bandana over his nose and mouth and car jacks a police evidence van a block away from the police station he works at, driven by cops he works with every day without anyone noticing it is him doing it.  It is written by Kurt Sutter who also wrote Sons Of Anarchy.  Which explains a lot about both shows.  Both a not well written. Both show a lot of action with no consequences.  Bad writing?

3950550,4,B002M2T1UO,"Terrific series, I watched it compulsively.  TWICE!  I have to give it four stars instead of five for one purely production-based reason: The final seasons didn't have the same great subtitles & dubbing choices available as the initial ones.  Because those menus presented as cheaply & unprofessionally put together, it seemed like a financially-based decision.  I'm an 8th generation American, but I like to work on my language skills by choosing English subtitles and French audio to improve my ear or else French audio AND subtitles so that I can try to test my ear and try to learn colloquialisms.  So the last episodes had less to offer in that respect, but we're also disappointing because this is such a multicultural and yet shrinking world,  why did they decide to leave all those good choices out? Well, kindly forgive me for the long review, but ""The Shield"" was an extremely well-written show w/incredibly talented performers yet those two written & spoken language limitations at the end just seems like the accounting department winning over a creative division.",1481760000,2,1076,5.0508474576271185

Does that stop me from enjoying the shows?  Not really.  Yes, it would be nice to have bluray quality, but the series was filmed with a rough, documentary style technique, and that's part of its charm.

3950570,5,B002M2T1UO,"Wow, what a great show.  I watched almost every episode when it played, but after that, FX doesn't do reruns.  It overlapped with and led me to Sons of Anarchy, which overlapped with and led me to Justified.  I was concerned that watching a show that started in 2002 would feel a little ""dated"", but as soon as I started watching, I remembered what an excellent show it was.  (OK, the flip phones were a little dated!)
Reading older reviews, people talked about the packaging problem.  That was definitely fixed.  It now comes in an album with two holes, about 1.5"" deep, and a spindle in the middle of each one where the discs stack up.  For so many episodes, it's definitely a steal at $30.",1472688000,2,692,4.444444444444445

3950594,4,B002M2T1UO,"As far as the show goes, this is a great show!  The packaging of this series is a decent one.  All DVDsare split up into two rows and stacked on top of each other (similar to a bundle of blank DVDs that you would buy from Staples, etc).  There is cardboard that you have to keep on top of the DVDs, otherwise, they will come out and run the risk of getting scratched.  So not the best, but for $30 for 7 season, I can't complain.  Overall, I think this is a good value for the price and would recommend it.  You just have to take time to ensure that all the DVDs are there and put up with them not being super easily accessible when progressing through the DVDs.  If anything were to happen to this set, I'd probably end up spending the extra money and getting the version that is like a book that has sleeves for the DVDs.",1467244800,,823,4.074534161490683
3950595,3,B002M2T1UO,"I love the series, and this is a great price, but 29 dvds is ridiculous. Shawn Ryan has stated that the 16mm film that it was originally filmed on wouldn't translate well to bluray, but who cares! I just want to be able to watch the series without causing my bluray/dvd drive to break from over-usage!

They could easily drop this to 8-10 discs in bluray format with the same quality. Worth it. As for this set, there's really no protection of the disks, so it seems very much like this was meant to sit on a shelf and not be used.

3950603,2,B002M2T1UO,"Good series with good acting and good video, but bad audio. My hearing is not good, so i use an amplified set of headphones that are good enough to let me hear most things. With this series, however, I hear little more than half of the dialog, so I miss much of the substance. The captions would be great, but they too skip a substantial amount of the spoken words. If I watched one of these disks at a friend's house, so I knew about the audio problems, I would not have purchased the set.

Edit: Reduced a star because season 7 disks have no subtitles. None in any language.  The audio track is still so bad that I cannot hear and understand any of the dialog, so watching the final season 7 is a video only disappointment and very frustrating.

I remember watching this on tv when it first came out.  Every single day when it came on everything would stop for one hour to watch this TV show.  Each episode is great and holds your attention  Ive since watched every episode again and loved owning them on dvd as one there is no commercials.  Two i do not have to wait till the following week to catch the next showing.  I was able to watch all of them in a few weeks.  My wife wasn't so sure about watching them but after a few episodes I had her hooked.  We had many evenings staying up way to late to watch this show.  Trust me you will not be disappointed in getting this tv series and at this price it is well worth it.  If you like action / drama the shield will not disappoint.  Best cop drama show i've seen and will probably watch it again in another year or two.  Currently another member of my family has this tv series and they have already made it through the first 2 seasons.

It's full of twists,turns,questions unanswered, pressure, deceit and Vic Mackey at the end although he's done wrong for sure is the coolest real life action hero ever in my opinion of course. The way in which everything falls apart in the end is depressing a little bit. Full of action and you have to pay attention. It's done in real life time and can be pretty fast (hectic).

This is a show about the good, not so good, bad and worse with little definition of who is where when.
Characters do very bad things for good reasons, good things for bad reasons as everyone has an agenda.
The situations are realistic; this is a cop show pulled from the newspaper with all the violence and problems that entails.
51 Emmy and Golden Globe nominations and 15 awards tell you that this is good TV.

The full series set has 247 Deleted Scenes, which I think are not separate in the season sets.
These are mostly longer shots with a quick glimpse on nudity that do not affect the story.
The discs are in two stacks, with a cardboard keeper on top of each spindle.
I have no problem with playing any of the discs, no scratches or glue.

3950715,5,B002M2T1UO,"This is a great series! This series I see as a pioneering type of show in the sense that it gave the feel of several shows behind it. This show has a lot of the same music choices and style of later shows like Sons of Anarchy and even Breaking Bad. When I first started watching this show I was unsure if I would ever be able to see The Commish in this role being a tough guy but he pulled it off. I actually think the stand out of this show as a whole is Walton Goggins. His character Shane Vendrel grows and progresses through this show into something he never wanted to be and ultimately out played by the man he was becoming. Very gripping drama that to me turned standard television on its ear. At the time this series was on the only show I think out did it was The Sopranos and that is a compliment of the highest order. Amazon's price for this complete series is outstanding also. If you are considering giving this show a chance, do it, it will suck you in.",1454457600,,966,4.116402116402116

3950729,5,B002M2T1UO,"I am rating the Series not the Packaging:

Starring : Michael Chiklis. Glenn Close, Catherine Dent, Reed Diamond, Paula Garces, Walton Goggins, Michael Jace, Kenneth Johnson, Jay Karnes, David Marciano, Benito Martinez, Cathy Cahlin Ryan, David Rees Snell, CCH Pounder

Many of the actors and actresses are my personal favorite. There are those that fully stand out as being flawless in their performances. That is what makes this series all the more powerful, is the top quality and brilliance by all those involved. Each persona captured their roles in breathtaking characterizations. The tight direction and flawless script writing created a reality that not only entertains, shocks, but also makes the viewer impressed and awe struck, at how amazing this series was created, structured and executed. The final result as a completion is powerful TV, powerful entertainment, powerful award worthy, award winning Grade A accomplishment.

As I have stated it is the strong acting by all that captures and creates this flawless series. One of those performers that stand out is Michael Jace. A wonderful character that captured a perfection in his role as Police Officer Julian Lowe. I think another reality that stands out to his ability as an actor is his career is at a standstill, because of personal reasons. There was breaking news that happened in real life in May 2014, Jace had shot and killed his wife in real life. He contacted the police and stated I shot my wife. He was arrested and charged with murder, just shocking. Its so odd watching this show again realizing the true nature of what happens to him in real life. He was such a gifted actor and its a true shame that the real life reality happened the way it did.

All the performers stand out. Even with the later added power house characters, such as the amazing Forrest and the one of a kind Glenn Close.

From the wins of Golden Globes, to Primetime Emmy Awards, to Satellite Awards, AFI Awards, Peabody Awards, ALMA Awards, this show won many, and was nominated by many. It deserved every award it won. Michael Chiklis took home the 2003 Golden Globe, and deserved it greatly. His character, persona through is performance was something that left a lasting impression upon me, and anyone who views this show, knows that reality.

Another is CCH Pounder. Pounder has always been a breathtaking actress that left me in awe, with her role in The Shield. Her character Claudette Wyms is one of those characters that make you remember.

Shawn Ryan created one of the greatest Crime Dramas to ever grace the Television World. It was a series like watching one complete start and finish of one group of people, or simply put, one long film with twists, turns, and total shock appeal. Ryan created a one of kind series, that many copied from. The Shield was a breathtaking experience that few shows can grasp. The Shield was perfection. Dynamic acting, flawless scripts, tight and brutal direction.

Chiklis' portrayal of Vic Mackey is excellent. I've made it through the first season and so far there have been no problems with the discs. They arrive stacked in two sections so I immediately placed them in individual jewel cases. CCH Pounder, Jay Karnes and Catherine Dent are also very good. Rather than do binge viewing I watch one or two episodes each night so that when I get home from work each night I have something to look forward to.  I can't praise Chiklis enough. The Shield is a classic show.",1451001600,5,675,4.31496062992126

I am so happy to own this boxed set, which is very nicely packaged. No need for any bluray on this one. Show is grainy and gritty, fits the theme perfectly.

Many twists and turns keep you guessing and you can hate and love the main character at the same time! If you like action and drama this is for you.  This show has violence,and mature scenes so it is not a family show.",1448841600,,422,4.0843373493975905
3950746,5,B002M2T1UO,"I love this show! It's action-packed, and hard to stop watching. Definitely binge-worthy! It is one of my top 3 TV shows of all time. There are ethical and moral issues involved- The ""Strike Team"" often do illegal things for the ""right reasons"", but they also do things for selfish reasons. The character development and story lines are great. Suspenseful. It's a show like no other.
Although quite different--I think it's on the same level of ""greatness"" as Breaking Bad, and much better than The Wire, which I just started watching.
People who are offended by crude language, sex, violence and drugs will probably not like it. But, other than that, I highly recommend it to others.",1448668800,2,683,4.846153846153846

While the show had some ups and downs, it really was a roller coaster of emotions and trying to figure out each character's motives.

So, if you are a big fan of the cliffhanger and don't mind watching hours of a show with what limited TV time you get, and never seeing an ending then by all means buy from Warehouse Deals.",1442966400,,583,4.330275229357798

3950795,4,B002M2T1UO,"Picked this up based on price. I was hooked on this show a long time ago, and never finished it off so when this came up for $40, I thought why not? The thing that I didn't love about this specific item is that the packaging is split in half, like a book. However, once you open it, there are two sections with two big spools and there are no dividers between the discs. They're all just stacked on top of each other and not protected. It would be better if they were bluray discs that are tougher but DVD's scratch easily so this could be a problem. Lets hope not. Otherwise, it's a great buy for the price.",1439769600,3,608,4.117647058823529

3950797,5,B002M2T1UO,"I wish I had seen this show when it was on TV!  The Shield is not for the young!  Even though it was on cable, it has a LOT of violence and language in almost every episode.  That said, it was gripping and hard to stop watching.  I was watching 4 or 5 episodes a night, it was that good!  The only thing I don't understand is why the folks who made this box set felt the need to do so putting about four or five episodes on each disc.  There are a lot of discs here, for a show that ran only seven seasons.",1439424000,,506,3.7714285714285714

3950800,5,B002M2T1UO,"One of a kind and often imitated, this show is a thrill ride to the bitter end. I don't often watch television shows again once they've completed their run. That is not the case for The Shield. I will continue to revisit this series over the years. Complex characters, a roller coaster plot, intensity that is unparalleled and the greatest anti-hero this side of Al Swearengen - if you've seen it before or are looking for an outstanding series, pick up this box set.",1438819200,,467,4.571428571428571

3950803,5,B002M2T1UO,"The last decade was one of anti-heroes from Tony Soprano, to Walter White, to Jax Teller. But the most dangerous of them all was TV's poster boy anti-hero Vic Mackey and the Strike Team.
Those of you who remember Michael Chiklis in the campy series from the early '90s ""The Commish"" where he played a goody-two-shoes small town cop are in for a surprise. As Vic Mackey, Chiklis is a dirty narcotics officer from the Farmington District of Los Angeles who breaks the law in order to enforce it. That means cutting deals with gang members, beating the truth out of people, and blatantly disregarding the bureaucracy of the LAPD. ""The Shield' is a seven-season unpredictable high-octane ride that will grab you with the pilot episode and won't let go.",1438646400,,748,4.7615384615384615

3950819,5,B002M2T1UO,"Wow. This was the rare series for me that I just couldn't stop watching every night after work. Nonstop action every season, great story lines and quite possibly the best finale to any major series I've ever seen. The acting is (for the most part) very well done, and every time they stretch the realms of reality, they always find a way to get it back to the point where it could be believable. For me, that was more than enough to rank this as the best cable TV series I've ever watched.",1436054400,,489,4.268817204301075

3950830,5,B002M2T1UO,"Packaging: You will see complaints about the packaging.  Today is 06/19/15 and at least as of this date the packaging has changed.  It is no longer in tiny little sleeves with or without protective sheets.  The disks now come on ""spindles"", half on one spindle and half on another.  The spindles are like plastic cylinders that the disks sit on, on top of each other.  See picture of open package of top disk -- there are 15 or so under the pictured disk.  It is not perfect but, given the price, it is excellent.  The disks will not get scratched.  The only down side is that it is difficult to pick a particular disk, for example, disk 24.  This set should cost well over $100 and was under $20, new, for me.  You can not beat the price.  I am certain that the price is due to the previous poor packaging, now fixed, and they are just trying to clear out their inventory of an item no one was buying because the reviews were so awful..

  I have watched the whole series and I just bought this series-copy for my son.  This is the best of any series I have ever seen.  I was captivated in the first twenty minutes and the show never let up from there.  You can read the other reviews to see what it's about.  Even at $120 -$150, I recommend this series.  Note to all: much violence, adult language, some explicit sex.",1434672000,7,1319,4.267206477732794

3950950,1,B002M2T1UO,"The show is great. However, the packaging is horrendous. The discs are stacked together on spindles and held in by oddly shaped pieces of cardboard. Not even pretty cardboard, just plain brown corrugated cardboard that you shove in there on top of the discs to hold them in. I'm estimating that they will wear down to unusable after removing them twice. So, as there is no way that I'll be able to watch 89 episodes of this show before the return date, and likely the stacking situation will cause scratches, I'll be returning this immediately.

3950959,1,B002M2T1UO,"THIS REVIEW IS ENTIRELY BASED UPON THE PACKAGING:

The packaging for this series set is TERRIBLE!  While it is hard to precisely describe exactly what the packaging looks like in words, I will attempt it anyways.  The dvds are stacked on top of each other in two plastic pieces within the box, and the disks had already fallen out before I even opened the package for the first time.  One of the plastic pieces even fell out of the box and had to be super-glued back in.  This is the cheapest packaging that I have ever seen, and is vastly different from what I have seen described in the other reviews.  Cardboard slips would be AMAZING compared to the stacks that they came in.

I have not even begun to watch this show, and I really think that I will enjoy it.  I hear that the character development is amazing and that the show covers some dark and interesting topics.  However, this packaging is awful and I would hope they change it back to what was described in the other reviews on this site.",1426032000,5,1000,4.391304347826087

3950961,5,B002M2T1UO,This show was amazing! So bummed out it ended! Vic was awesome from the beginning until end. Will be rewatching this show. Awesome! Took me right in from the start and just kept getting deeper.,1425686400,,193,4.542857142857143
3950962,5,B002M2T1UO,"The show itself is spectacular. One of my favorite shows ever. The packaging however, is terrible & lazy. All 7 seasons are stacked on top of each other in just 2 deep slots. So, in order to get season 4 disk 2, you have to take every disk from season 1-4 out. I wish there was 2 sets of stars for grading,1 for the product the second for the products packaging.  Id definitely give the Shield 5 stars. Thnx

****UPDATE****
I wanted to add a few things,because it is definitely a must buy.
The writer,is Kurt Sutter,who also does/did Sons of Anarchy, so theres lots of drama,& violence.
Actor Michael Chiklis,who played small bits in Sons of Anarchy, & played the Thing,in the GOOD,Jessica alba FF.
Then theres Walt Goggins,who played an interesting role,in SoA,was the main antagonist,in the other FX show Justified(which i highly recommend). Also,the new series SIX,& voice acting for Prey,the Bethesda video game.
Again the show is awesome, but think double stack pancakes, & thats how the DVDs are,packaged,which is ludicrous.  I also added photos,since i bought this,i didn't know how to. As you can see,it folds out,to 2 piles of pancakes. I also gave it more stars,since the show deserves 10 stars
I don't want people that don't read reviews, to just look at the stars,& because of my 3 star rating,the % of 5,would be lower. So,i gave it 5.",1425686400,,1348,4.703389830508475

Even for a cable network television series, it is easy to feel the weight of each moment, and overlook that they were restricted to not have R rated content in here. For all of the bad things that the main characters do, The Shield does not glorify them, and consistently and ultimately shows ugly consequences for each wrong deed. The end of the series is the best ending I've ever seen to a serious drama ever. There are some cheesy moments, but it takes a nit-picky finger to point them out when the rest of the show is so good. If you have an open mind and the subject matter even mildly appeals to you, don't hesitate to buy this series.

If you're going to effectively keep track of what disk you're on, you're probably going to have to put all of these dvds in a cd case instead of just leaving them in the box.
The box is set up in the same way as a rim of blank dvds you might purchase, with one rim facing upwards and another facing upside down, and each of the dvds stacked one on top of the other, which makes it annoying when you're just trying to put one disk away and get the next disk out.

Too reminiscent of Rampart in Los Angeles - the stories and characters are all neither good nor bad; some are more bad and of course, they are the most interesting characters.

I think that this series was the original ""breaking bad"" as every single thing that the main character does leads to more disastrous conclusions. We watch a years-long arc of a small tight group of detectives maneuver their way through prostitution, bribery, embezzlement and graft, battery and murder. Are they the good guys, or are they the stuff of our nightmares? We each have to decide for ourselves.",1403654400,,849,4.691275167785235

FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS THAT EVER GRACED THE AIR AND PUT FX NETWORKS ON THE MAP FOR THE SHOWS EVERYBODY KNOWS AND LOVES TODAY, ESPECIALLY SONS OF ANARCHY. GIVEN KURT SUTTER WAS A HUGE PART IN THE SHIELD PRODUCTION AND WRITING FROM DAY ONE. AND MICHAEL CHICKLIS ALONG WITH POWERHOUSE WALTON GOGGINS MAKES FOR SEVEN SEASONS OF NONSTOP INSANITY. ONCE YOU'VE WATCHED THE PILOT EPISODE, YOU CANT STOP TIL IT'S OVER. AND WHAT AN ENDING TO SUCH A LANDMARK SERIES. IN MY OPINION AS A WALTON GOGGINS FAN, HE OWNS THE LAST EPISODES OF ""THE FINAL ACT""

THE SHOW SPEAKS FOR ITSELF RIGHT FROM THE JUMP. BUT DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU ABOUT THE PACKAGING!!! BECAUSE SORRY TO SAY, AMAZON WILL NOT!!!! I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW WHEN I OPENED THAT BOXSET. AWFUL. DVD EXTRAS ARE EXCEPTIONAL,WITH COMMENTARY ON MOST OF ALL 88 EPISODES, AND A SPECIAL BONUS FEATURES DISC ALONE. HAVE FUN DIGGING IT OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE 2ND STACK! I TOOK ALL DVD'S AND PUT THEM INTO MY OWN SLEEVES TO PRESERVE THEM ALL. IF YOU DON'T HANDLE IT CAREFULLY OVER TIME YOUR DVD'S WILL END UP IN BAD SHAPE. YEAH IT MAY BE ADVERTISING AS A ""BOXSET,"" BUT [BOX] IS THE KEYWORD HERE!!!!!!!!!! I IMAGINE ANYBODY AIMING TO BUY THE ENTIRE SHOW HAS ALREADY SEEN IT. 5 STARS FOR ACTION, DRAMA, WRITING, DIRECTION, AND ULTIMATE PRODUCTION, DELIVERED BY AN UNFORGETTABLE CAST...

*Plastic spindles are fairly sturdy
*Nice, solid cardboard box that shouldn't fall apart on you
*Cardboard inserts kept the discs from shuffling around during transport, no scratches at all (and yes I checked them all)
*As far as I can tell thus far, all the extras from the previous set

The episodes are in widescreen - don't remember if this is mentioned in the specs. I haven't gone through all of the discs, but it appears as though most of the extras from the original sets (deleted scenes, commentaries) have been ported over.

The problem with the packaging is that the discs are housed on 2 spindles built into the packaging. There may be grooves there intended to keep the discs from touching, but you know how that goes. The outer packaging is book-style, similar to Fox's DVD version of the Alien Quadrilogy. This one isn't as bad as that one, in terms of the number of folds, but it is still too thick for the flimsy packaging. In all, the show is still one of the best shows ever but if, like me, you didn't buy the original series set after reading about the problematic packaging, don't bother with this one either.",1380585600,11,987,4.5083798882681565

Without it, they would never have been able to take the ball and run with it if this show didn't lay out the blueprints first.  With a top notch story, some of the best acting I've ever witnessed, and documentary like filming style, this show is definitely one to etch into the history books.  Created by Shawn Ryan, this show is a spectacle, just short of a miracle.

Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) is the leader of the Strike Team in fabled LA neighborhood, Farmington.  He leads a Strike Team that includes Shane Vendrell (Walton Goggins, in what I would call the best performance in TV or film that I have every seen), Curtis ""Lem"" Lemansky (Kenneth Johnson), and Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell), who often do not play by the rules, and break the law to preserve the law, throughout the show's 7 seasons.  They are opposed by the precinct's other cops, including Captain (and later, City Councilman) David Aceveda (Benito Martinez).  The show also includes sidestories featuring others, such as police officers Dani (Catherine Dent) and Julien (Michael Jace), and the detective duo, Dutch (Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder, another performance that never got any award season love).  Others came and went, such as guest season stars in Glenn Close (who did win herself an award for this), Forrest Whitaker, and Anthony Anderson (taking a turn from the comedy to play an excellent villain to the Strike Team).

The show has ups and downs for each of the characters, but none is stronger than the central one, Vic.  Chiklis gives a lights out performance during the show's run, and got himself plenty of awards to back that up.  His struggle, in keeping a straight face in committing murder, robbing money, beating suspects, and stealing drugs, balanced with taking care of his estranged family, is one you feel with him until the show takes a sharp right turn and makes you understand just how big a monster this man truly is.  Only after a heinous act by his teammate, Shane, and continued acts of continued violence and loose behavior, do you as the viewer realize what you just witnessed.

Trust me on this, you will not be disappointed by anything you witness with this television show.  It laid the groundwork for shows that followed on FX, AMC, HBO, and Showtime, and even network television.  Do yourself a favor and get this.  Now.",1359417600,,2455,4.752358490566038

3951330,5,B002M2T1UO,"I have not seen any of these and I have wanted to watch The Shield for the longest time. The problem was there was not a complete set before this and to buy the seasons individually would have been at a great expense. So First I would like to say thank you for putting this together and at a reasonable price. I was a little hesitant to buy this because I read about glue and scratches on the discs on arrival. I then read about sleeves that they included to fix the problem. Then in the middle was reviews talking about sleeves did not work. My desire to watch this series made me want to roll the dice and take my chances. I got the package and there is a plastic sleeve that holds the box and it is slightly damaged. It's not a major deal its probably just from being moved around and what not. The box is set up like a book. It has the cover as it is displayed with a cool looking badge on the front you open it up and it has artwork which I will include pictures at a later time. I was like where are the discs? I noticed they are in the pages with cut outs. I pulled out the first disc and it came out with a white sleeve on it which I guess was the protective sleeve people were talking about in other reviews. It is a white plastic / paper material that kind of static clings to the disc. Awesome for protection, however I am afraid I might lose it while the disc is in the DVD player. I inspected the disc and it appeared to have some stuff on it. I think its fuzz or something because I easily removed it, after that the disc looked flawless. I inspected the discs up to about season 3 and they all appeared to be in pristine condition. I decided to stop. I have yet to watch any of them at this time and will update this review if I encounter any problems. This is a pretty cool thing for a collector. I have it displayed in a DVD case but it is wide and takes up a whole shelf for itself. If I had to say something negative about it, it would be that I do not like how the discs are housed. But there is no major problems with it that would constitute a deal breaker for me.",1352764800,8,2086,3.98090692124105

Many people have compared the Shield to Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard the Third.  It has also been said, that unlike most television Dramas, the Shield, in its entirety, has a three act structure, with key events happening in the lives of the characters that completely change the dynamic of the show.  I'd have to choose the final season as my favorite, and I also consider the series finale to be the best season finale I've ever seen.  You must watch this show all the way to the final episode.  If you were to stop short of the end, you really would not understand it completely.  Everything that happens in these characters' lives culminates in the final few episodes.  Two days ago, I watched the final episode again.  I've watched the entire series, front to back, twice already, so nothing that happens in the story comes as a surprise anymore.  Despite this fact, when the episode finished, I just sat there, overwhelmed, and almost in shock.  I think my reaction was due to the fact that I was taken aback by the sheer quality of this show, and by the degree in which it affected my life.  The fact that a show this great exists is almost a miracle.",1349395200,,1323,4.512605042016807

3951355,5,B002M2T1UO,"I watched this series during its initial run on FX network, several years ago. I began watching it midway through season 2, and it instantly became appointment television. I have since purchased the entire series on DVD and watched it all the way through, and it was even better the second time around (albeit, no commercials, no series gap, was definitely a plus).
What makes this cop show stand out is the writing and the acting. What you have is a fictional district in LA, one with high crime and an underfunded police department trying to control the streets. Enter Vic Mackey, who consistently pushes the morality line in an effort to curb the crime. The statement that sums up Vic Mackey is ""Does the end justify the means?"".
The four members of the strike team all bring their own baggage to the table, and the writing team of Shawn Ryan, Glen Mazzara (and others) play the personalities of the entire police department off of each other. At times, you feel you are part of the show because the acting and character portrayals are very consistent from season to season. At times you feel like you are at your own office with the different types of people that you have to deal with every day.
Walton Goggins portrayal of Shane Vendrell is one of my favorite performances of TV... the downward spiral of one of the most respected members of the strike team is a very understated career performance (let's just say you will HATE that character when the show is over!).

The end of the series is one of the best endings to a series ever. You need to see it to believe it. I have also seen the Wire (many people compare these two shows), the Wire was a fantastic show as well, although they are two very different shows. The Shield is a faster paced show, one where quick decision making is essential to the character and story development.

I rented Disc 1 through netflix and after two episodes decided to order the Complete series. It was such a great show, had me hooked every episode. The way they shot it is amazing with the handheld/shaky camera feeling helps you become even more riveted with the episodes. They flesh the characters out very well and it makes it near impossible to root against Vic and the boys.
I first noticed Walton Goggins on Justified and thought he was amazing as Boyd, so to see him as Shane in the series had me even more excited.
Kenny Johnson as LEM was another surprise as I thought he was great on Sons of Anarchy. So I definitively think this is a five star show and collection",1333756800,2,775,4.27891156462585

Mackey is definitely the best of Michael Chiklis' characters, and his follow-up with ""No Ordinary Family"" was a big letdown after dirty Vic and his crew.

3951359,5,B002M2T1UO,"Having watched all of the 7 seasons at once,I think that this series is better than 'The Wire'.
A batch of police and detectives are shoved into the middle of the worst suburb of the city in LA by the politicians to contain racial hatreds and rivalries and the worst examples and effects of the drug war. Their own weaknessesand temptations makes the whole effort a tragedy.
The only effective way to fight the collapse of this society in to become more like the people with whom they are struggling and who destroy anyone who tries to reform from within.
Children will not go to school because they make more money by selling drugs and relying on the worthless relevance of violent gangs.
Why become a doctor if you can make yourself rich this way?
Thse only way to destroy the power of the drug lords and remove tempation from outsiders who become corrupt,is to get rid of drug related crime by registering addicts and prescribing drugs from hospitals or specific medical clinics at cheap rates.
But society will implode before our politicians feel the electorate can accept this solution.
'The Shield' is a Shakespearean work of prime, character driven drama. The realistic violence,which many people in Australia decry,is wholly realistic and necessary to reveal the dissolution of the main characters and the inabilty of 'innocent' people to cope with the changing moral boundaries of this collapse.
The last thirty minutes are as harrowing as anything I've seen'.I am am still amazed at the quality of this writing and chacterisation. Great art.",1332720000,,1551,4.923664122137405

3951364,5,B002M2T1UO,"The nearly 30 discs in this series are firmly secured inside the heavy cardboard pages of a coffee table book.  Sometimes it can be so hard to get the discs out you would think they were either nailed in, glued in, or you were pulling against the force of a vacuum.

In this box set, the first four seasons are finally available in widescreen.  That may or may not be a good thing.  I've watched the first few seasons many, many times over the years on TV and in their original DVD presentations. (full-screen format).  Watching two of those episodes in widescreen now seems a bit disconcerting, really.  The camera work on the show has always been very ""active"", and in the different aspect ratio it draws even more attention to itself.  Your brain gets used to one thing and then it gets thrown a curveball.

Your mileage may vary.

Regardless of that, ""The Shield"" is one of the best and most well-written drama series of all time.  I've watched the whole series straight through a few times already and I never get tired of any of it.  It's compelling each time.

If you already own the original release sets you won't get an overwhelming amount of new stuff with this one.  There's a brief video of footage of the set of the Barn being dismantled, but it's more depressing than fascinating.  But it's nice to have the option to watch seasons 1-4 in widescreen.  If the price is right, go for it.

A question for the die-hard fans of the show:  in the very last scene of the final episode, do you think Vic settled into his new fate or do you think he's gonna buck the system yet again and not take his punishment lying down?",1322697600,,1629,4.412751677852349

3951395,5,B002M2T1UO,"The Shield is nothing less than pure brilliance; the storyline and characters are enthralling from the first to last seasons. Shawn Ryan's gritty drama shows Los Angeles' real situation as a city with glamour on the surface, but its underbelly is a seething mass of violence and disillusionment that occurs in any urban environment, despite the image that most people hold. Every member of the cast gave memorable, unbelievably strong performances; given that the cast is so large, again praise must be given to Mr. Ryan and Kurt Sutter for creating storylines that make each character integral. Michael Chiklis as Mackey (definitely a play on Machiavelli) was sheer genius because he captured what we fear in police officers: the ones who make one decision to become as brutal and mercenary as the criminals they claim to protect us from, under ""the shield"" of justice and morality. Walton Goggins was indeed menacing as the ""apprentice"" Shane; this actor was a joy to watch each episode, and along with the simply indomitable CCH Pounder, deserves high marks and awards for his courage in undertaking a very vulnerable and difficult role: these two actors will be the most memorable for me, as Glenn Close and Forest Whitiaker (sic) are a given as masters in any role they are in.

The casting, plot lines and sheer jaw-dropping standard of acting are so superior to other imitative series. Each episode is multi-layered, and holds the viewer's attention. Michael Chiklis and his team are so credible in their roles that it is easy to forget that the show is fictional. The tight scripting and breathless pace demand repeated viewings. Personally, I don't feel that there are any weak episodes - in my opinion, the only other series that would receive this accolade is ""The Sopranos"".

3951407,4,B002M2T1UO,I bought this box set as a Christmas gift for my husband who loved this show. The only thing I was disappointed about when I got the package was that it was not in any sort of padded envelope or box. One of the corners got cracked and had I been giving this to someone other than my husband I would have been very upset to give something that was damaged. So far that is the only damage we can see - since he hasn't opened it up yet to start watching them.,1293408000,,456,3.913978494623656
3951408,5,B002M2T1UO,Loved the series on TV and wanted to get it so I could watch it whenever I wanted.  It is an excellent series.,1292976000,,110,3.782608695652174
3951409,5,B002M2T1UO,"On the set:
This entire set like this is one of the best deals you will ever find. You could go out and try to get each and every season on its own, and piecing them together MIGHT get you a deal like this. Still, if you missed out and you want to wathc it then you are going to really want to see it all. Itt is an addictive show and it has things in it that HAVE to be followed up. If you miss a piece you miss a lot, so having all the seasons here is a great opprotunity. Beyond that, you get a few little things here that you might not find on your hunt - nothing I thought was major but things you might like and can see listed in a product layout.
It would make the best gift to someone, yourself included.

On the show:
What do you get when you put a cop on the street, give him the keys to the kingdom, protect him with a badge, and then show him exactly what can and cannot get done? You get one of the best series to ever grace the screen. From the roots of the series and the rocky start of our very nefarious cop to the end of everything and the way the dominoes fall is beautiful. I honestly had no idea what would happen. You get to knwo these people,a ll of them, and you get to know everyone else in the unit to. you see ""The Barn"" for what it is; a group of personalities that have their own lives and their own problems and their own ways of doing things. some of them are simply people trying to get by while others - well, they are walking slopes that really seem dangerous. All the while you keep wondering when things will cave in and who will do the honors and, well, it keeps you engaged until the end.
I haven't loved a show like this in a long, long time.

When it came to The Shield, it was hard to fault the show. It started with a bang and it ended with a bang, and this was not one of those things that got cancelled along the way,. It CHOSe to go off on top and that was a great thing. Otherwise it might have lingered and the people on the top didn't want that. What they did want was for the show to spin a web aroudn the watchers that would captivate them and it did that and more. From the streets and the way things were handled to the thngs going on behind closed doors, this series had it all. all the people were here, all of them were somewha flawed, and all of them were interesting. I remember watching one of the detectives, Dutch, and I kept wondering if he was going to slide into madness when a specific event involving a cat happened to him. It made me think and question and watch everything again just to see clues relating to that person. And the whole thing is like that.

As far as acting, you have the best fromt he top to the bottom. Simply look over the cast and you see a list of talent a proverbial mile long. It really is amazing to note how good the going got, too, because having that many names in a show on TV is not the regular thing you see. Still, The Shield had it.

If you want a season by season break down, there are those on the product pages. Getting this gets it all, however, and it does so at a cost that you really would like. Had I not gotten it a while back I would have jumped here, and I have known two people that have picked this up already and can say with certainty that it is high quality and nice. You know what you want and know why you want it so you have to make the call. Stil, if you are wonnering, it is WELL worth it.",1292630400,4,3409,3.943396226415094

Rated it 4 stars because of the way the discs are a little difficult to remove in the dvd book, but the series is 5 stars and the best show I've ever watched.

All episodes are widescreen which is different than if you bought them separately which has it in full screen, which will take me getting used to.

Although a little tricky to remove from the sleeve, each disc is protected by the white insert, so its not as prone to scratching as the other reviews said when there was no protection for the disc.

If you don't mind every episode in widescreen then it is worth it to buy this complete series booklet since they fixed the disc scratching problem for the most part.",1284076800,83,1104,6.243421052631579

Our Shield box set comes in a cardboard box with file type folders which house the DVDs. this didn't look like a good way to store the discs but the main problem over here is that one of the episodes is missing 20 or so minutes due to international cuts so any fan of the show should stick with the US set...

So I bought this US box set when it was on the Amazon Deal of the Day and even though I was nervous about the amount of reviews there where about packaging problems it was UNCUT so I thought id take my chances.

I recieved the item quickly and paid no cutom charge so this was an absolute steal at 38($59)

Apart from the actual box set being a bit oversized - it is one of the best box sets I own. All the dvds are housed within the thick pages of this coffee book style packaging with each page displaying photos and images which relate to the characters of the show, and they are all wrapped in white glossy paper to avoid scratching.

El protagonista, un antihroe, se enfrenta todo el tiempo con un dilema: lo quiere versus lo que debe. Generalmente opta por lo primero -su propio beneficio- pero descubre que no siempre es capaz de manejar las consecuencias. Es un manipulador nato que slo ocasionalmente es traicionado por sus emociones.

Las actuaciones son impecables, con un soberbio Michael Chikris. El guin se basa en el conflicto y su resolucin, no siempre favorable, lo que mantiene la intriga hasta el final.

3951422,5,B002M2T1UO,"Before I review the Shiled itself, I want to let everyone interested in the show know that the packaging issues involving scratched discs has been addressed.  The book like format is the same, but the packaging now contains slip covers for each disc of the show.  This prevents the discs from getting scratched, and provides further and better cover to each disc.  Be warned though, if not careful in pulling out the discs with the slip, scratching may still occur.  Otherwise, the pacackaging is pretty cool, with pictures, and references to the entirety of the show.  For those a fan of the show, its a pretty nice rememberance, for those new, it provides several clues with relatively minor spoilers.

As to the show, to call it one of the finest cop dramas is a bit limiting.  It is just one of the finest shows.  The acting is top notch, with you often losing the feeling your watching actors, and truly feeling like your watching a documentary.  The writing is just as good.  In fact, the use of the book style in packaging is the perfect example of the show: its like a novel.  Each season bleeds into the next, with story elements of the first season being relevant all the way until the final season, with many story lines in between crossing between seasons.  The show packs an intensity as well as emotional punch that is simply superb, with the right amount of humor and angst anyone could require of any show.

The show is violent and foul, so those looking for a sitcom probably won't find a lot to like.  But the use of violence and foul language helps the realism of the show, and necessary as judging Vic Mackey as a good guy or bad guy wouldn't be so morally grey without both.  This of course goes to the heart of the show: is Vic Mackey a good person doing bad things, a bad person doing good things in a bad way, or somewhere in between.  The show leaves it up to you to decide.  There aren't too many shows of this caliber to come along, so cherish it when you have it.  Highly recomended!",1277078400,69,2011,4.433242506811989

Speciically the disks came in a greating looking book two inch thick book covering all seven seasons, and the disks were in slots in the very thick heavy duty cardboard pages.  Anway, that problem has been solved with some sleaves that cover the disks when they go in and out to prevent scratching.  So now a great product with no problem regarding disk scratching.

I was going to give this two stars, but back down to one for reminding me how horribly handled this package was.  My mom loved the show, but is terribly upset that she won't be able to finish the show because of the lack of subtitles.  =(",1275523200,10,520,4.288659793814433
3951425,4,B002M2T1UO,"As has been mentioned often, this box set, while it looks spectacular, is not exactly disc-friendly. So to avoid any scratches, I picked up some DVD cases to house the discs.....better safe than sorry. The extra $5 I spent was well worth it, and as of this writing the total price would still fall below $100. Which is one helluva price for every episode of one of TV's finest crime dramas ever.

besides the price, another incentive for purchasing this is that the earlier seasons are now in widescreen format. now that more & more people are picking up widescreen TVs, i'd consider this a nice upgrade since the original airings.

in addition to the issue with the disc sleeves, another negative is the absence of subtitles for season 7. it's head-scratching, especially since seasons 1-6 have that option.

5 star show, but one star docked for the sketchy disc sleeves (although a few bucks oughta rectify the situation) & the subtitles issue with season 7....",1275350400,,963,4.789156626506024

They could have easily cut out the other side of the cardboard, so you can grab them with your finger tips. That would have been a 100% improvment, but still not optimal for a complete series collection with so many discs. The discs were not scratched or damaged at all, as far I can see.

And it really is a shame because this is really a beautiful set that's made to look like a coffee table book and the discs are near invisible if you don't look for them.  I was really hoping Sony had fixed this by now but it looks like they have not.  I'll be contacting Sony tomorrow to ask about getting a replacement.  Hopefully they've come up with a better solution to this issue than two thin pieces of paper, because I would really love to have this set for my collection.",1274745600,,754,4.39568345323741
3951428,2,B002M2T1UO,"If you're looking at the reviews for this show then you probably are already a fan and know the show is great. This review is about the product set.

Overall, it's very poor in terms of disc protection. This set comes with an outer plastic sleeve which protects the book that houses all the discs. The print job, artwork, and paper it is printed on are all very good and adds a lot to the set but that is where the good ends.

Each page houses two discs which are stuffed in between the page. Each disc is ""protected"" by a paper sleeve which covers the front and back of the disc.

These by themselves wouldn't be so bad but whoever manufactured this set hired some real apes to put them in there. Several of the discs I received were badly scratched while others had torn paper sleeves. Most of the discs had debris stuck to them. Some of the discs were hard to get out because the apes who put them in there shoved them as hard as they could.

My suggestion is this: If you are really a huge fan of the series, consider paying more for each individual season set that has its own plastic case. Before this set, I would buy all my TV shows on those sets instead of the big ""collector's package"" even though they cost more. Amazon had this on a gold box deal which made me go with this. Typically these collector's sets are poor quality and are just a way for the manufacturer to save money. ""Less plastic cases, more penny paper, and who cares about quality these days?"" - Manager of the Factory

If you get defectives, it's a lot easier to send back just one season rather than an entire collection and have a better chance of getting a good set.

If you do decide to go with this set, do yourself a favor and inspect every disc first hand and then place them in a disc wallet for protection. Otherwise after years of viewing, your set will be trashed.

Such a shame that these collection sets are always worse off than the individual seasons.",1274227200,7,1945,4.297814207650274

3951430,5,B002M2T1UO,"There were many groundbreaking things about the Shield as far as filming techniques, characterization, pacing, etc.  But what they really nailed perfectly was the management of the story arcs.

There is a spectrum of show structures where the extreme ends would be ...

1)  Shows where each episode is entirely self-contained, and you can watch it without knowing what happened before.

2) Shows where knowledge of the prior history is required to enjoy the show.

Most shows generally fall somewhere in the middle.

What made the Shield unique was the way it had multiple story lines (up to 10 going on at a time) that ranged from the very short (single episode) to very long (spanning multiple seasons).  These story lines would intersect in unpredictable and amazing ways.  A character that appeared earlier in one of the long story lines may suddenly have an effect in one of the shorter ones.

It's hard to relate this, because it was so complex.  But it was so well done that it seemed each episode had a ""WOW"" moment where something happened that could only have been setup by these complex interactions.",1273017600,3,1111,4.825396825396825

3951433,5,B002M2T1UO,"I recently finished all 7 seasons of The Shield.  This series has to be in my top 5 TV series of all time.

The show is very character driven.  Each one usually has a typical ""cop show"" subplot, but the broad arcs are about the characters.  Make no mistake, this is a very dark show.  I would find my moods affected by watching it often times.  I like how ""real"" the characters are.  Even the moral centers of the show do bad things and have human failings.  In my view a large part of the series is a meditation on morality.  Vic Mackey does some horrible things but is also in many ways a good and sometimes even heroic character.  It embraces the shades of gray that real people are made up of.

If you have any attraction to action dramas then watch this show.  After the first episode you will know if you like it or not.  As a testament to how much I liked the series, after I finished it I went online and watched the videos F/X hosted of conversations with the cast and creator.  That's not something I ever do.

3951436,5,B002M2T1UO,"The strong arm of the Law:

The Shield... is a hard hitting and unforgettable ""Ride Along"" with one of the toughest COPS ever to hit the ""Beat"" on one of Americas toughest city's...  Los Angeles. Ladies and Gentlemen meet Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis, The Commish 1991) and his entire ""Gang"" appropriately called ""The Strike Team"" an Anti-Gang and Drug Task Force Unit.
The series begins with an introduction to the Men and Women of the Law (who mostly Protect and Serve)  stationed inside a building dubbed ""The Barn"" Farmington Districts newest addition (originally concieved to be a deterant for criminals) located in the shell of a former church.  Here the fight against crime begins. Only trouble is Capt. David Aceveda (Benito Martinez, Saw 1) strives to become the first ""Latino Mayor"" of the City and he will need the support of the ""Peoples Vote"". He concludes the best way to achieve that would be to take down corrupt Cops from inside his own Dept. Who might you suppose his first targets will be? That's right Vic Mackey and ""The Strike Team"".
This as you can imagine will not be a smooth transition, 95% of ""The Barns"" Very Helpful arrests are made by Vic and his ""Strike Team"". Aceveda has gathered some pretty incriminating ""Intel"" against Vic and has deployed an undercover officer to join the ranks of ""The Strike Team"" in the hopes of capturing the evidence needed to ""Shut Vic down"", thus opening the door for Aceveda's ""Political campaign"".
Seven seasons of ""The Shield"" dictate that Vic will not go down without a fight and it is this premise that will keep the ""COP Drama Junkie"" coming back for just ""One more Hit"" from this highly addictive T.V. Series ""The Shield"".

The Setup:

 This Box Set contains all 7 Seasons of the Emmy-Winning (Groundbreaking) Series from Writer Shawn Ryan (Nash Bridges). It is stored in a collectible 34-page bound anthology book filled with photos, quotes and a special letter from Shawn Ryan.
The 28 DVD's included have all 88 episodes including a bonus disc with two never-before-seen featurettes. There are 63 hours of amazing special features from all seven seasons including Commentary tracks from the cast and crew, deleted scenes and much more.

The word on the street:

 I had heard allot of rumors from people about this Box Set being poorly put together... The discs were supposedly smashed in between the pages of the 34-page Collector book and pulling them out was known to scratch the discs horribly along with some other packaging issues, a thin plastic layer incasing each DVD to protect the surface of the discs.
The issue (I heard) was that the plastic sleeve would stick to the surface of the discs and leave traces of the plastic behind rendering certain discs unplayable, and you might have to tear apart your book to place them in your own individual Jewel Cases.

The Evidence:

 I ordered my set from Amazon for $107 and was surprised when I felt the weight of the Package, a heavy 5 lbs (?). I opened my package and carefully pulled out this coffee table style book that was sleeved in its own plastic casing showing you what is inside and explaining the contents.
I slid out the book (that looks leather bound) and opened up what was the most beautiful collection of quotes and photos from the desks of the more prominent characters from the series, (depicting each of their individual personalities). As promised I found this highly collectible and was more than satisfied.
Not only were the discs placed neatly between the pages (that are actually about a quarter of an inch thick) I did not have much difficulty pulling them out, however I always treat my most valuable collections with ""TLC"" and this would be recommended here.
The thin plastic layer reported on was actually what you would find on the screen of a brand new cell phone and it clings to the discs to avoid scratching and I did not find any adhesive issues from the sleeve... In fact it folds in half where the DVD can easily be returned before placing it back in its own slot located on top of its corresponding page (season 1, disc 1 etc...) my advice would be ""Treat this with kid gloves"".
The special features were a blast and I felt like I got to ""Kick it"" with the ""Gang"" of my most beloved and not so beloved, characters from the series...  I personally could not find anything that could make me unhappy with this set and I am more pleased with this product from Amazon than I have been with any of my other (satisfactory) purchases.

Meet The Gang:

THE STRIKE TEAM:  Vic (Michael Chiklis)  Shane (Walton Goggins)  Ronnie (David Rees Snell) and Lemon Head (Kenneth Johnson).

The barn: Dutch (Jay Karnes)  Claudette (CCH Pounder)  Danny (Catherine Dent)  Julien (Michael Jace)

The others: David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)  Kavanaugh (Forest Whitaker)  and Glen Close as Captain Rawling.

3951441,5,B002M2T1UO,"The presentation of this series is incredible.  It reads like a book with the DVD's slotted in where appropriate.  I was not expecting this to be anything more than a box full of DVD's, it was a nice surprise.",1265155200,2,209,4.333333333333333

3951443,5,B002M2T1UO,I can't believe every review bashed the packaging. This complete series set is one of the best....no is the best packaging I have ever received. I am a collector & either I got something the other reviewers didn't or ? This collection is very well done. The artwork on the pages & episode info is very well done. If allowed I would give it 10 stars. All this goes without saying this was one of the best series on television. 10 STARS,1264550400,2,434,4.304878048780488
3951444,5,B002M2T1UO,"I really wanted to order this set but held off when I read all the reviews talking about the packaging problem.  When the product went on backorder, I hoped Sony was fixing the problem and placed my order.  The set arrived with paper inserts protecting each disc.  No scratches on any disc.  I have only played the first disc in its entirety (it was the only one that was slightly difficult to remove from its slot in the package) and it was flawless.  This is a great series---don't miss it!",1263772800,23,492,4.4222222222222225

3951446,5,B002M2T1UO,"This series was awsome. From the moment you watch the Pilot to the final episode it keeps you guessing and on edge. A great cop show and has enough comedy to make you smile. Many people have complained about the booklet it comes in. My Disks were great, not a scratch on them and slide in and out fine. Perhaps they fixed this from earlier models.",1262476800,,347,4.2727272727272725

3951448,3,B002M2T1UO,"Ditto what the previous reviewers wrote.  When I removed the DVD's from my brand-new shrink-wrapped box-set, they were already scratched!  Not merely smudged but the deep NetFlix-caliber scratches that catch your fingernail and which not even the Blu-ray player could ignore.  And yes, I must now return it.
Otherwise... one of the greatest, most intense TV shows conceived.  Also, extremely well-cast.  I can't name a single weak link in the primary cast.  Unlike NYPD Blue.  (Ugh)
So five stars for the adrenalin-rush of the series, ZERO stars for unimaginably bad packaging.  Be warned.",1261699200,5,589,5.258064516129032
3951449,5,B002M2T1UO,"I have seen the complaints from many on disc scratches and agree there's the risk with these cardboard sets. But if you can get past that, this is still a fantastic show that shines no matter how it's set up. This ranks right up there with ""The Wire"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" as the greatest dramas never nominated for a Best Drama Emmy. But thier loss is the viewer's gain.

It's amazing to consider just how much ""The Shield"" changed television. Before 2001, people figured that the only way to do real hard-hitting adult dramas was pay cable such as HBO or Showtime. But ""The Shield"" changed that forever, making people realize you could do daring TV without needing such utter freedom as long as it worked. And it does, in every way possible. Without this show, we wouldn't have ""Nip/Tuck,"" ""Damages,"" ""The Closer,"" or ""Mad Men."" That's more of a legacy that most shows get but it's well earned.

In one set, the series is truly a novel for television, a look at a district so riddled with crime that the cops often have no choice but to break the rules to keep order. The character shine throughout and provide a fantastic roster: A beat cop struggling with his sexuality; his partner showing how hard it is for a woman to be accepted in a man's field; a noble detective who keeps being hopefuly despite the darkness of his cases; and the captain who's willing to put his goals of political office over justice. And at the center is the Strike Team, a group of cops who regularly bribe, accept bribes, blackmail, steal and even murder while wearing the badge. Throw in season-long guest appearances by Glenn Close and Forest Whitikar and you've got sheer brilliance.

The prime reason the show works can be summed up in two words: Michael Chiklis. The actor deservedly won an Emmy for the show's first season but should have been in the running for every one after. His Vic Mackey remains one of television's most amazing characters, a man willing to do anything to get ahead but Chiklis manages the impossible: Not only making a cheating, murdering corrup cop not only someone to root for but even a sympathetic figure to boot. Half the fun of the show is seeing Vic managing to pull his schemes right under the noses of his superiors and keep on top. Yet you feel the pain he does with his family problems and more. Thanks to him, the show shines as well as it does and the actor should always be remembered for his work here.

The extras are terrific with slews of commentaries, deleted scenes and more. The box set has a good booklet on the show as well as a bonus disc of new features, such as the real-life police scandal that inspired the series. But it's the show itself that deserves attention, not just for how it changed the rules of cable TV but how it happens to be one of the most powerful, shocking, emotional dramas ever. From the first shot to the stunning finale, ""The Shield"" is a must-have for a fan of TV, no matter what genere you like. And if the box set isn't perfect? Well, the number one rule of ""The Shield"" was always how it's not a pretty world but you make your best with it.",1259280000,7,3112,4.483245149911816
3951450,1,B002M2T1UO,"I only give this set one star because of the way it was packaged.

If it was just about the quality of the series and the episodes themselves I'd give it 5 stars.

The set is packaged in a coffee table book type case that, while great looking, is not practical for holding DVD disks. The DVDs have to be slipped in and out of a very tight space in between two sheets of cardboard. Almost every disk in this set had small scratches on them and some had huge gashes in them. A few were unplayable. There were also small particles of glue on the disks that came off of the cardboard book packaging.",1258416000,69,595,4.165217391304348
3951451,3,B002M2T1UO,"Been watching the price of The Shield: The Complete Series Collection. Preordered from Amazon and couldn't wait to get this set.  Very nice looking book that holds all 29 DVDs. The DVDs are sandwiched between the cardboard pages. Spots of adhesive got between these page and the DVDs were slipped in and the adhesive scratches the DVDs when taking them out or putting them in. Also some adhesive sticks to the DVD which makes it very hard to get out. You have to pick the adhesive off about half the DVDs. Very poor quality on Sony's part. The book looks very nice but being 7 "" X 12"" it dose not store with any of my other Series. Would look nice on the coffee table but not where I want to keep my DVDs. Amazon has been great, they are sending me another set. Amazon don't think the Glue will be a problem in them all, we will see. Today you can buy The Complete Series Collection for $107, buy the Season 1 thru 7 buy them selfs and it cost $235. Hope they fix the problem.",1258416000,10,976,4.219251336898396
3951452,3,B002M2T1UO,"Many of the DVD's were scratched, and scratched badly upon opening. This is not an Amazon shipping problem, but a Sony packaging problem. It seems that the glue to hold the pages together dried on the inner sleeves, and when you pull them out (DVD's) the scratch on the hard glue. I am getting a replacement set, hopefully this was an original production run problem.",1257465600,54,367,4.661538461538462
3951453,3,B002M2T1UO,"I have only seen season 1 of this REALLY GREAT show, and I decided to buy The Shield: Complete Series in a 'coffee table' style book because for only $109.99 it seemed like it was a great deal.
Well, it was anything but a great deal, and from this I have learned a lesson to never buy a 'coffee table' style book dvd set ever again no matter how beautiful the 'coffee table' book is.
The 'coffee table' book is really beautiful in this The Shield: Complete Series set as it has alot of nice pics and notes, but every disc in this set was horribly scratched. And I mean every single disc was really badly scratched. It was a good thing that the store where I bought it from allowed me to return it for a refund, because usually a retail store will only allow an exchange for the same item.
So now I have to decide on how much I really like this show to buy each season set separately, because that is not cheap as that will cost more than twice as much as the Complete Series set by itself.
Oh well, it was a lesson learned.",1257292800,13,1023,4.12
3951454,5,B002M2T1UO,"Superbly written with a story arc that spans the entire run of the series.
Acting, adrenaline, and all that other good stuff that makes you spend (or should i say INVEST) time in watching the crooked path Vic Mackey walks on.  You'll always want to see what happens next....even till the end.  Even if you've never heard of the show, or have never watched an episode, the price is too good to pass up on the entire series.  YOU CANNOT watch television the same way and in this day and age where pure narrative/fictional shows are getting drowned out by reality garbage, THE SHIELD set a new standard.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.  The Shield has the best elements of every other show: 24, The Sopranos, Law and Order, and much more.  BUY NOW.

3951455,3,B002M2T1UO,"I am a fan of The Shield and I am guessing that you are at least familiar with it or you wouldn't be looking at the box set.  Since you are here to decide to buy the box set or not, I want to warn you that they have created something that looks like a picture book which has the discs squeezed between the pages.  The problem is that every time you take a disc out or put it in, the disc is scraping across the surface of the cardboard pages in which it is sandwiched.  The book is nice looking so I did give it 3 stars for that reason and of course the series itself is as the other reviewers have mentioned well worth your time if you like the cop genre.  If this is the only DVD series you own, it would look nice on your coffee table, but if you have a DVD case it is awkward because of the shape and size of the box.  I suppose they create these cardboard box set holders to save money or to get you to buy the series in the boxes that you get with individual seasons.  I had the same problem with the complete series of the Wire.  I will probably have to take the DVD's out of the box set sleeves and put them in conventional plastic DVD cases to protect the DVD's which is an additional expense to consider if you are buying this set to save money.  It would be nice if the manufacturers offered alternative (conventional) packaging as an option without forcing you to buy the series one season at at time for double the price of the box set.",1257206400,122,1449,4.024390243902439
3951456,5,B002M2T1UO,"This set was just released today.  I have not purchased it yet.  The only way this product would get less than five stars would be if something was seriously wrong or if any episodes are edited.  I'm assuming this is just a repackaging of the season sets' discs.  If there is anything wrong, I will come back and address that.  The discs could be bare bones episodes for all I care.  The actual show is what counts.  I couldn't resist the chance to write this review before actually getting it.  I've seen the entire series close together and I've been waiting for this set before buying any seasons of it.

This series is the best series ever.  I have my favorites.  This is one of them.  Its not my personal favorite series ever but I consider it the absolute best.  It would be like if someone said, ""My personal favorite movie ever is 2004's The Girl Next Door, but I consider Wall-E to be the best movie ever.""  Well, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is my personal favorite series ever, but The Shield is the best series ever.

This story is a must-experience.  I think the greatest moral story ever told.  Even for a rebellious guy like me, it will bend my morals.  It's like having two best friends who are like brothers and not knowing who's side to go on.  You see both sides, but you realize they are both innocent and both guilty as hell.  It's all FUBAR.  Its our system.  That's the way it is.

These characters are so real to me.  I love them very much.  This series spans three years, and it feels like I've spent a lifetime with them.  They are like brothers to me.  The Strike Team.

Claudette and Dutch.  My god.  Those two are like the superiors, the moral compass.  Danny and Julien are like the new hands (arrows) on it.  Finding their direction.  David Acevada is the magnet that knows where he wants his arrow to point.  The Strike Team is the other magnet that takes control of the arrow and points it in every direction, knowing where they want to go but having no idea what lies in that direction.  And what a hell of a direction they go.

This is the only series I have witnessed from beginning to end that each consecutive season actually tops the previous seasons.  There are SEVEN seasons.  Or Seven Acts to this story.  And it only gets better and better.  After seeing each season from the first one, you would find it hard to believe.  To actually finish the FIFTH season (which you will hear many who've seen it say its probably the best season of anything they've ever seen) and be told that the next two seasons get even better is an unfathomable imagination.

This series delivers.  Serial television are novels to the short stories known as movies (feature films).  And this is that novel that will drag you to hope and deliver you to hell.

EPIC.  THIS STORY IS EPIC.  The characters' arcs are like no other.

I remember seeing numerous promos for this series even when they called it ""Rampart"" and ""Mackey"".  It looked like some dumb cop show.  I decided to watch the first episode for the hell of it.  It was pretty good.  But I had no idea what I had found.  Over seven years later, just like the Strike Team, I had absolutely no idea that the road I set out on would lead to this.  The pre-premiere promos said, ""TV you'll never forget"".  Pretty good prediction, FX.

So complex and genius in its execution.  Nuanced storytelling and direction ensures that this isn't some breezy watch, you need to pay attention to fully understand.  The weave gets more and more complex and brings back little things you wouldn't have remembered if you watched it in a carefree manner.  And it also gets more and more engaging.

I never imagined while in the middle of the series, particularly Season 3, that this series would be allowed to reach its conclusion or that it could even live up to what you could imagine.  Almost all television series get cancelled before their proper conclusions.  Thanks to FX Networks, they followed through 100%.  When watching the final season, its the most amazing contrast and parallel to the first season on how the climactic conclusion plays out and where the characters are now and what they have become.  Genuine.

Experience this.  It will be one of the most important experiences you have in your life.",1257206400,5,4282,4.526867627785059
