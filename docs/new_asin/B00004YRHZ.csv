1378188,5,B00004YRHZ,Excellent transaction - item took awhile to come but seller was very honest in how long it was going to take and it did come within the time frame.  I emailed the seller a few times to ask questions and response was immediate.,1221609600,,226,4.255813953488372
1378189,5,B00004YRHZ,You gotta love him!! There is just no one like Michael Jackson!!! His videos are out of this world and this behind tyhe scenes film proves it!,1200009600,,142,4.296296296296297
1378190,5,B00004YRHZ,"They need to make this on DVD and they also need to make Moonwalker on DVD too. They need to help Michael get back. The video ""Thriller"" did good back in the 80's. I would do good if it can back now. This is Michael's best video that he made and is the best video ever made to mankind. No one can match to Thriller. It's the best, nobody can beat the person who is the best. Also it is almost like he wrote how to make music videos and people follow that.",1137888000,7,455,3.903225806451613
1378191,5,B00004YRHZ,"Michael Jackson strives to be perfect in life, because that's the only way to be, as best as you can be, and keep on moving forward in life, with everything you do. This film shows that through and through. Everybody in the universe knows Thriller. If you don't you must live on another galaxy, or you're not born as of yet. I remember when this video (VHS) was first released, and I saw a huge display of it at are local ""Hills"" department store. (remember those stores?) and was ""thrilled"" to death. I think I was about six, and was never one to really ask for anything,... but when my mom saw my face lit up at the huge Hills Michael Jackson Thriller display, she was like,... ""would you like to get that?"" I was like, yes please, thank you! thank you! mom!,....

The rest has been ""HiStory""",1134518400,6,794,4.364864864864865
1378192,5,B00004YRHZ,"I remember this video from when I was about 10 years old.  My sister, cousins, and I would play this over and over.  We knew EVERY dance step.  Michael was better looking back then.  We loved seeing the ""quirky"" moments on this video that showed his true character...I wonder if he's still the same?????  It's a great video that is the ultimate of Behind the Scenes or The Making Of... type of videos. If you're interested in costume make-up or what goes into the making of videos this is a good tape.  I don't listen to this type of music now, but this brings back a lot of my good childhood memories.  It represents times when we were happy and songs were about simple things, not killing, fighting, and all of the crazy and obscene things that songs are being made about now.",1130803200,13,778,4.398601398601398

1378195,5,B00004YRHZ,"This a great movie to show at Halloween. It goes through the entire process of making the Thriller video. Shows how they made the masks, costumes and choreographed the dance moves.",1354320000,,180,4.838709677419355
1378196,5,B00004YRHZ,"I first saw Michael Jackson's Thriller Video when I was only 3 years old. However I only saw the edited version which begins when you see the close up of the outside of the movie theater. I still thought it was the coolest video I ever saw! I did not see the Full Version until I rented this movie a few years later, and I enjoyed that one even better . I loved this movie and thought it would've been released back in 2008 as a bonus dvd with the Thriller 25 Deluxe edition. Unfortunately it wasn't, and the vhs version is long out of print. I sure hope this movie is released on dvd some time soon, there are many young MJ fans who should have opportunity to view it like I did! It would be even sweeter if ""Making Michael Jackson's Thriller"" got released as a double feature dvd perhaps with ""Michael Jackson, The Legend Continues"" or ""Captain EO"", which also have not seen a proper dvd release! If you're an MJ fan like me and can find an acceptable or like new vhs copy at a reasonable price I say buy it. I can't think of a better way to honor Michael's Memory than giving this film a proper dvd release, I know the fans would go out and buy copies!!!",1340582400,,1157,4.169642857142857
