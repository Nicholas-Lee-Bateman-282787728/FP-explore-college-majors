You'll find yourself recognizing specific moves that you've seen fron great college and pro players.  The shooting routine which makes up the bulk of the video is very challenging but doens a great job of combining shooting and conditioning with real game techniques.

I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to improve their ability to get a good open shot while facing tough defense.",1188172800,,499,4.847058823529411
