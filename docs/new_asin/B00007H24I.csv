1811619,4,B00007H24I,"I think nearly every horror movie fan is aware of the notorious ""Guinea Pig"" series by now. If you like horror films or gory curiosities and aren't aware of this explosive series of Japanese movies, you ought to rush out right now and see a few of them. Made throughout the 1980s and 1990s, ""Guinea Pig"" pushes envelopes few people in this country would ever conceive possible. After viewing one of these repugnant films, a natural impulse is one of extreme revulsion. Why would anyone create such soul shattering images? It's important to remember that Japanese audiences possess a different attitude about horror films. As far as I can tell, in Japanese cinema anything and everything is fair game. A typical jaunt through the wilderness of Asian horror cinema (in which Japan plays a significant role) typically reveals graphic scenes of dismemberment, torture, and other no-no nasty behavior that rarely, if ever, appears in American films. Some films containing such stomach churning themes do occasionally rear their heads on this side of the pond, but these films rarely play to a wide audience. In Japan, the ""Guinea Pig"" franchise was a spectacular hit.
I haven't seen all of the films in this series, but out of the two installments I have watched, ""The Flower of Flesh and Blood"" easily wins the prize for outright sleaze and nastiness. It's difficult to imagine any film approaching (or descending to) the levels seen in this mind blasting forty-minute movie. Even Pier Paolo Pasolini's sickening homage to the evils of fascism, ""Salo,"" fails to invoke the visceral sensations that ""The Flower of Flesh and Blood"" wallows in. This movie is a sledgehammer blow to the head and stomach with its unrelenting scenes of carnage and depravity. They ought to sell copies of this wrapped in a barf bag.
Manga artist Hideshi Hino directed this nightmarish look into the activities of a sadistic serial killer. That we know this guy is a serial killer and that he likes to stalk his prey before committing a brutal murder constitutes the plot in its entirety. There simply isn't much more here than a short stalking scene at the beginning of the story followed by a thirty-minute dismemberment filmed in nauseatingly sadistic detail. That's right, folks: ""The Flower of Flesh and Blood"" exists to show the viewer what it might be like to watch a snuff film.
Forget about character development. Two characters exist in this movie: the poor young woman picked up by the killer, and the killer himself. At least they made the murderer look like a complete psycho, as the guy wears a samurai helmet, a full body leather apron, and some sort of black caps on several of his teeth. This gentleman does not fit the bill of a role model in any way, shape, or form. He's a degenerate who likes to wax philosophic between removing arms and legs, blurting out weird lines about how his next activity will imitate blooming flowers and the like. At the end of the movie, he sings a melancholy song about sending people to the underworld. He also shines a different colored light on his victim at various times, although why he does this makes little sense. The majority of the film takes place in some seedy basement splashed with blood and filled with numerous tools of pain. Then you watch this guy commit his atrocities and that's it. There is nothing more to ""The Flower of Flesh and Blood"" than close up shots of bloody mayhem.
The DVD contains many interesting extras. There are several trailers from the other installments in the ""Guinea Pig"" series, one for the zombie film ""Junk,"" several text interviews with director Hideshi Hino, an overview of the controversy involving Charlie Sheen (who supposedly saw this film and believed it was a real snuff film), a behind the scenes look at the special effects involved in the series, and a reproduction of a manga comic book with loose ties to the film written and illustrated by Hino. The documentary on the special effects provides some comfort after watching the gruesome movie, showing that it is all nothing more than a well made horror film. Still, I'm uncomfortable with the knowledge that ""The Flower of Flesh and Blood"" made such a big splash with Japanese audiences. Remember, this is the same country that committed the atrocities in Manchuria during the late 1930s, and there are still people living in Japan today who were intimately involved in mass murder and mass torture throughout Asia during World War II.
I think this entry in the ""Guinea Pig"" series ultimately fails to deliver the goods. As a gorehound, I appreciated the awesome special effects displayed in the movie, but the movie never rises to the occasion in terms of character development and plot. I watched the other Hino directed entry in the series, ""Mermaid in a Manhole,"" a few years ago and I thought it well developed and interesting. In that film, which contained numerous graphic scenes, Hino developed a plot heavy on human suffering that showed emotional pain as a real tragedy. In ""The Flower of Flesh and Blood,"" he indulges in sadism for the mere sake of sensationalism. If you really want to see this movie, just steel yourself for the depths of degradation. If you have kids in the house, don't even think about buying this film if there is any chance your children might find it. This is not acceptable viewing for youngsters, and it probably isn't acceptable viewing for most people. Beware, oh beware! ""The Flower of Flesh and Blood"" is upon you!",1062028800,61,5489,4.828025477707007
1811620,5,B00007H24I,"I have the complete set of Guinea Pig films and trust me, 'Flower of Flesh and Blood' is by far the best. The special effects are incredible and extremely believable.
The plot is simple - a girl gets kidnapped by a stranger who ties her to a bed and whilst wearing a samurai suit, starts to disembowel her and hack her to bits.
It's super-strong stuff and not your average gore flick but I heartly recommend this one.
Well done to Amazon for making this so freely available and on such a good DVD.",1058832000,6,497,4.297872340425532
1811621,5,B00007H24I,"Let me tell you that this film was hard to sit through. You can imagine with all the other Guinea Pig movies I was somewhat prepared to what i was about to see. First off beautiful looking DVD, the menus were creepy enough without seeing the film yet, then i pusued into the movie. This is sick and what i was looking forward to, the part where the hand curls up after he takes if off was tactfully pulled off, i can see a little bit why Chucky Sheen went ape after seeing the movie. I won't go into more but i was rest assured by watching the Making of GP to see what a blast these people had making the movies that have grossed out many. The manga was a nice touch with the added english translation. I'd have to say this the best DVD out of the GP series that has come out and can't wait to finish my collection!",1038960000,9,815,4.037037037037037
1811632,1,B00007H24I,"I suppose if you were told this was real, and didn't have an ""eye"" (what a pun, eh?) for special effects.. you might see this and feel sick.  But, come on.. where do I start on how fake this is?  I know, I know, the whole story about the producer doing this as a remake of what he originally saw.  If that's true, then I'd say the original is probably pretty sick and twisted.

But I'm talking about effects here that give it away.

For one thing, the blood.  I grew up with chronic nose bleeds.  I used to wake up in the middle of the night and find my pillow soaked in my own blood.  So I know what blood looks like, both when fresh and after five minutes of drying time.  It doesn't look like raspberry sno-kone syrup like in this flick.  After more than five minutes it starts turning brown.  By the end of this flick it would have coagulated into strands and looked almost black in many areas.

Another thing.. the cut-away edits that conveniently happen just before any real cutting occurs.  Like the decapitation scene.  Speaking of which, since when does decapitation cause a head to go flying like a basketball into a wall five feet away?

And then the whole eyeball thing.  I once stayed up until 1a.m. removing an eyeball from a sheep that got hit by a car.  I know from experience, it takes a hell of a long time to remove an eyeball without damaging it.  The eyes in the jar were from a sheep, the one he pulls from the latex head was manufactured.

Then the disembowelment thing.  Drugs or no drugs, without turniquettes she'd have bled off and died long before wincing while her leg was being sawed.  But back to the guts.. do you know how much distance there is between even the upper-G.I. tract and the throat?  You have to pass the stomache and go up the esophagus, then past the throat.  YET.. here he is playing with intestines and she starts leaking pure, red blood out of her mouth for no damn reason other than dramatic effect.

Lame, lame, lame.  Unless you come across it for free online (like I did), don't waste your money on this over-hyped flick.  I'm not saying pulling off this finished product was easy.  This guy had some talented people working with him to design these latex parts, pumps and the custom bed that allowed her real head to show while hiding her body.

One last minor detail.. the worms at the end of the flick in his 'collection' of body parts.  If you watch the maggots, only in one scene are they actually feeding on an old piece of meat.  The rest of the time they're traveling around looking for something besides latex and red sugar water.  Also, the earthworms.. earthworms don't come oozing out of  a skull that's been sitting there for weeks in a tumbled pile (on cue) all slimy.

Save your money, what you've imagined in your head is probably ten times worse than what they produced on film.",1182297600,8,2849,4.396551724137931
1811633,2,B00007H24I,"The reviewer crowsomething pretty much summarized it well- the victim should have died much quicker and lost buckets of blood - it just oozed out.  The body parts looked rubbery.  Did I miss something but how did her head go flying against the wall? And what's with the maggots and earthworms.  Wouldn't the body parts have to decompose for at least a few days and then flies would have to come and lay eggs? The killer was kind of weak and dopey, as well.

I watched the video on the internet, i would say definitely don't buy it.",1174003200,2,531,4.387755102040816
1811634,5,B00007H24I,"This movie is short and sweet with some of the best special effects I've ever seen. The Japanese build a replica of a human body and dismantle it before your eyes. The special effects are so amazing you can actually see each pore in the skin. They obviously spent a lot of time on the effects and thats about all they spent time on. No story, no character development, just a home video made to look like a snuff movie. This is the one movie that actually turned my stomach a little bit. Go buy it now, if you think you can handle it.",1172707200,,534,4.144230769230769
1811635,5,B00007H24I,"If there's anything to take from this film (anyting at all)
it's perspective.
Take for instance, any given horror scene you've loved;
Because it's only on screen for a few seconds, it's enjoyable.
Now take that same cherished scene and slowly stretch it out for 40 minutes.  That about sums up this gorefest.

With that being said, I had to watch this flick on the subway, on my way home from work. (Unfortunately, that's where I have to watch all the movies my wife refuses to watch with me.)
Now I couldn't hear the comments from my fellow commuters, but I could certainly see the horrified looks on their faces as the movie ran its course.  And all those dropped jaws said ""This guy is one sick puppy""
More than a few of them stood up and abandoned their seats.
Now if you know anything about City Subways, you know people wouldn't give up their seats, even if their pants were on fire.
At any rate, that anecdote should serve as a general idea of just how depraved this simulated snuff film is.

There's no plot, so don't expect one. (A guy in a samurai hat takes his sweet time cutting up some poor, unfortunate, Japanese chick; before adding her parts to his collection)
Instead; expect a torturous mutilation for about 40 minutes.
The mutilation itself wouldn't have been so unnerving, had it not been  done at such a casual pace.  The ""Psycho Samurai"" (as I've come to know him) takes his time doing everything.
From selecting his instruments of torture, to making his cuts, he's a man of leisure, a man whose got time on his hands.
All the while, he's talking philosophy, (like he's not some kabuki theatere reject in white face paint, and a black samurai hat, preaching in an abandoned warehouse basement)
I've got to say though, the scene where I actually had to pause the film for a breath of air, involved a hammer, a wedge, and a shoulder.
Now I don't know about you, but something about the sound of metal on bone makes me lose my cookies.
I must admit, the special effects were amazing.
The director definitely owned a genuine snuff film at one time or another.  Because he is spot-on.

This film is a testament to depravity.
It's sole design is to freak you out and make you sick.
and to that end: Mission Accomplished. 5 Stars.
A fine addition to any gorehounds library.
Or any horror fan, for that matter, who thinks they have an iron-clad stomach.  But be fore-warned this is the litmus test by which all other gross-out movies will be compared. This is the epitome of ""gorefest"".
(It's especially fun to freak company out with this little gem.)
Watch at you own risk.  You've been warned.

1811636,5,B00007H24I,"INTRODUCTION: When Guinea Pig came out in 1985, It was a huge straight to video hit in japan. There were 6 films and in 1991, Charlie Sheen saw Guinea Pig and reported it to the FBI, claiming it was a snuff film. THe FBI were informed that there was no snuff footage. in 2001, GP comes out on DVD.,

I had recently just rented this one (and Devil Doctor Woman) from a Japanese video store. And I loved it! I loved HE NEVER DIES, so I knew I was going to love this one.

STORY: A man captures a woman in the middle of the night. Later on, the woman wakes up in a blood splattered dungeon run by a a man dressed as a samurai with a white face. Slowly, this man dismembers and disbowels the woman to add to his collection.

THOUGHTS: An excellent splatter horror film. Just to let you know, there is a disclaimer at the beginning at the film saying that no one under the age of 15 should see it.

OVERALL: Go rent this movie!",1150156800,3,922,4.077348066298343

The video that it was shot on looks too clean and pretty, BUT there is a hidden easter egg on the DVD where you can watch the entire movie in ""SNUFF VISION"" which is better if you want a more gritty feel.

There isn't really any complicated storyline here, but that's fine.  It makes it even more amusing and it will give your friends even more odd and confused looks on their faces.",1130457600,4,545,4.211538461538462
1811638,3,B00007H24I,"Ok maybe i am wrong but a lot of movies on Amazon are overrated.
This happens to be one of them. I have seen alot of gore and am big into asian-horror check out some of my other reviews.

So lets see now Flower of Flesh and blood..
Well if you read half if not more of the reviews on here they will lead you to believe this is the sickest movie they have ever seen and its nasty but clearly fake in everyway.
People talk about its realism ,with out the hand scene where it closes after bieng cut off this is not much more than rather good effects for the time period. but still this film lacks realism.
Just like cannibal holocust this movie is overrated.
It is there job as the film director to fake me out and make me feel like its real this just didn't do it for me. i have seen worse things in Takashi Miike films i dunno maybe i am wrong but as a gore fan this movie is not believable in any sort of way. the sound effects make it even worse i thought i was watching a kung fu movie for a min.
If your new to the gore scene this may be for you all you other gore fans out there we will pick out every flaw in this movie.",1128729600,3,1125,3.8701298701298703
1811639,1,B00007H24I,"I would like to start out by saying that i heard that this was a truly horriffying movie. I was expecting babies being raped with knives kind of crap, but instead i got horrid effects, ruined illusions and overacting. True the topic it dealt with i guess is disturbing to people who have been kept in the dark that is current society. All in all i have seen worse things here in Iraq, if there is anything that i can say to desuade you from purchasing this DVD, imagine that i have said it... Weak...",1119139200,8,500,4.273684210526316
1811640,4,B00007H24I,"The main thing I couldn't stop asking myself throughout the viewing of this film is how anyone could mistake this for being a real snuff film. For one, the girl should have died within minutes of having her hand sawed off. Instead, she keeps breathing strongly and her face still contains a healthy color clear up until her executioner eviscerates her, exposing her viscera in all its sanguine wetness. Furthermore, the rubber looking body parts that the serial killer presents to the viewer as his ghastly collection looks as if they were bought from a cheap Halloween party shop. I think the most disgustingly realistic looking thing about these final scenes was the squirming crawling orgy of maggots and earthworms as they dripped and slid their way across the surface of the obviously fake body parts and skulls.

Also, I didn't think that the gore, guts, blood, and violence lived up to the hype and controversy surrounding Guinea Pig. I felt that there should have been much more blood, buckets of blood, soaking the blankets and pooling on the ground around the bed and with the exception of the beheading, evisceration, and the masterfully done scene in which the tortured victim has her hand chopped off, it didn't look as realistic as it should have been. If you want to see some serious gore I recommend watching The Men Behind the Sun instead.

And as far as being severely disturbing, I think Salo and Cannibal Holocaust has this movie beat.",1118966400,2,1455,4.816

7976685,4,B00007H24I,"Guinea Pig II: The Flower of Flesh and Blood (Hideshi Hino, 1985)
[originally posted 7Jul2000]

Hideshi Hino is, simply, one of Japan's finest exports. Writer, graphic artist, rabid media critic, all-around fun guy, but for as long as civilization exists he will be best remembered as the guy who drove Charlie Sheen to the FBI.

Sheen saw Guinea Pig II: The Flower of Flesh and Blood in 1991 at a party he was attending, and he was convinced that it was a true snuff film, so he took the copy and gave it to the local branch of the FBI. Large-scale investigations in both American and Japan followed, culminating ultimately in (a) the finding that GP2, like all other supposed snuff films, isn't real, and (b) Hino exploding in popularity in the United States (it's not a coincidence that an American graphic arts publisher started releasing Hino books in America in 1992, all of which I recommend very highly as a fantastic glimpse into the collective subconscious of post-WW2 Japan). The darker underbelly of the investigation resulted in the [ed. note 2013: temporary] banning of Guinea Pig in Japan. To date, no distributor has picked up and reprinted the films officially (though the ban has not stopped new ones from leaking out, and the series now stands at nine [seven films and two making-of documentaries]), and so when one finds copies of Guinea Pig films, they are often fourth- and fifth-generation dubs of questionable quality at best. I have my doubts as to whether even owning them in the United States is legal, but one assumes that if it weren't, the sellers on ebay would be arrested pretty quick... but I'm relying on supposition here. (If I disappear quickly, you know why.) [ed. note 2013: the series has since been reprinted twice on DVD in box sets, once in 2002 and once in 2005.]

Yesterday I received a third-generation copy of II and IV (see vault review 1-5-14). GP2 is the most infamous of the series. It is also the shortest, clocking in at a scant forty-two minutes. It has no plot to speak of. A woman is abducted by a man dressed as a fourteenth-century Samurai warrior and systematically dismembered. And while, if you know the basics of film composition and realize that the cut shots could not have been done in the ways they are if this were actually being filmed in real-time, there are a few points where the best thing one can do is to sit and repeat to oneself ""this is not real."" The effects are, quite simply, spectacular (within the framework of what's going on), and I was pleasantlyif anything about this can possibly be said to be pleasantsurprised by the fact that other than the differing genders of the two players in this twisted, brutal sturm und drang (and much more drang than sturm, if you translate it literally), any sexuality involved is read into it by the viewer.

Guinea Pig 2 is not something to be enjoyed; it is something to test the boundaries of one's endurance. How is it possible to rate such an experience? And do you really want something like this in your home? In my case the answer is an unqualified ""yes,"" but then, I'm depraved. Going strictly on the quality of my copy and the shattering effectiveness of the film at what it sets out to do, I'm forced to give it *** .",1388620800,,3246,4.620450606585789

For an older movie, the special effects were great, and soooo up in ur face.  Its an interesting film, that's for sure.

If you're up to trying other gore films, I highly recommend these Japanese films, they push the envelope all the way!!!

WOW!!!  That was such a gut-wrenching film.",1319241600,,514,4.440860215053763
7976688,3,B00007H24I,"Supposedly based on a snuff film that was sent to Manga artist and filmmaker Hideshi Hino (this was later found to be a fabrication created for the film), Guinea Pig: Flower of Flesh and Blood caused an uproar when actor Charlie Sheen famously reported it to the FBI believing it to be a real snuff film. It wouldn't be unfair to say this was ridiculous, `cause as you've seen or may see...It's obviously NOT real.

This 41-minute film opens with a young woman being stalked and eventually abducted. The abduction scene has multiple camera angles and credits, I want to point out. When the woman awakens, she's tied to a bed and her abductor is dressed as a samurai. At the 17-minute mark, he begins graphically dismembering her body...Which lasts until the very end.

That brief description encompasses the entire plot of the film. The actor portraying the killer is a genuinely creepy looking fellow, but little else about this film is very creepy. I wasn't particularly horrified or shocked by what I saw in the film. The knowledge that it's fictional and the fact that the victim is drugged into a comatose state throughout her ordeal makes everything that occurs more disgusting than disturbing. What Flower of Flesh and Blood does accomplish is relative realism. A lot of people are divided on just how realistic this film appears to be...Well, it's certainly more realistic than the gore presented in many other horror films, especially when the low production cost is taken into account.

But, overall, this film does fail to live up to it's hype. The creepiest part of the film for me was the image of the man's ""collection."" While a curious piece of horror filmmaking, don't expect anything deeply horrifying or revolutionary. So, while it's nothing special it is worth watching if you're a horror/gore junkie and you're curious about the infamous film.

7976689,4,B00007H24I,"When people talk about the infamous ""Guinea Pig"" series, this is the one they are really talking about.  This is the one that inspired serial killer Miyazaki Tsutomu, who performed its rituals on real victims instead of with special effects.  This is the one that Charlie Sheen mistook for a real snuff film and reported it to the FBI who investigated its director.  This is the one of myth and legend.

""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" is directed by famous Japanese horror-manga artist Hino Hideshi, he of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hino-Horror/dp/0974596183/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hino Horror</a>&nbsp;series which have been adapted into films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boy-from-Hell/dp/B00077D99K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boy from Hell</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ravaged-House/dp/B000F0V0A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ravaged House</a>.  He claims that this is a recreation of an actual snuff film sent to him by a fan, but Hino is well-known to stretch the truth when he feels like it.  Or just to lie, so I wouldn't take him too seriously.

There is no story, and this is basically just an exercise in special effects.  A man dressed in a samurai costume slowly dissects a drugged woman over the course of 42 minutes, slicing her here and there and taking off the pieces to create his final ""flower of flesh and blood"".  For gore fans, this is as good as it gets, just pure craftsmanship with a special effects artist demonstrating some quality work and no annoying plot getting in the way.  People will be quick to point out how ""fake"" it is, but that is probably just bravado more than anything else.  This is really well done.

This DVD also includes the ""Making of..."" feature that the producer and director put together in order to prove that they hadn't actually killed anyone.  It does take away a bit of the magic and legend, but is a nice feature in and of itself and is probably more interesting to watch story-wise than the main feature itself.

Is ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" a good film?  Not really.  Not for casual viewers.  But for gore-horror fans, this is required viewing to see just how far someone can go.  And if the creepiness of knowing it is all smoke and mirrors takes some of the fun out of it for you, you can just remember that all of this DID take place for real, in Miyazaki Tsutomu's apartment, even though he was inspired by the film rather than the other way around.",1225065600,2,2577,5.4
7976690,3,B00007H24I,"I heard about the Guinea Pig movies for years but never got around to seeing any until now. While I suppose the acting and the production value were okay for something of this nature, I was a bit underwhelmed, probably because the whole thing just seemed like a long commercial for the special effects people. The effects were pretty cool, but it takes more than special effects to hold my attention, even for the length of this film.

The story, told by text on a black screen before the movie starts, tells of a legend in which photos of a dismembered girl were sent to an artist, who promptly handed them over to the police. That's pretty much the end of the plot, because the rest is a dramatization of how the murder occured, making it basically a fake snuff film. The gimmick here is the killer collects bodies and he thinks it's beautiful when a woman's body is squirting blood from its severed limbs. Scooped out eyeballs are particularly lovely, at least according to this guy. As there is no real plot, I can't be too wary of giving out spoilers.

Basically, this guy kidnaps women in the subway and dismembers them slowly while dressed kind of like Darth Vader before adding them to his collection (which would've fit nicely in the house in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and singing weird songs. The end part was almost entertaining because of the over-the-top Fulci-esque skulls with worms all over the place and the singing.

If there is one reason to actually watch this, it's the special effects, which are explained nicely in the Making of featurette that is also on the disc. In fact, the Making Of was a lot better than the movie, and it made me wish I'd rented He Never Dies instead of this one, because it seems to actually have a plot.",1220400000,4,1764,4.558359621451104

5) Disembowelment.
6) Licking said decapitated head.
7) Eyeball plucking.
8) Eyeball sucking.
9) The Psycho Samurai (I like your name for him, Captain Insanity!) then sings a song that includes the words ""pool of blood"" ""sea of fire"", and throughout the movie spits dialogue that is ten times cheesier than even the cheesiest Japanese comic book. (Even though I used to love reading the ""Rave Master"" manga all the time a while ago.)

Now before you go and say ""Wait a minute, Bill! You're giving away the whole movie!"", I'll say this: ""Guinea Pig 2: Flowers of Flesh and Blood"" is NOT one of those movies where you hear about the gore and just neglect the movie. It's a VISUAL EXPERIENCE. A visual experience where you should NOT EAT WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE! HAHA.

Obviously, this is NOT A SNUFF FILM, even though there's a good chance you might be able to fool somebody into thinking it is. But then again... I don't know everybody that way. So, while Flowers of Flesh and Blood:
1) Has no plot.
2) Barely has any dialogue.
3) Only revolves around two characters.
and 4) Is only 42 minutes long...
I GOTTA give this five stars just for the director having the simple but awesome idea of just making a short film about bloodsoaked, gore-splattering, mutilating insanity!

IMPORTANT NOTE:
You may hate this film. You may think it's a pointless ""gore for sheer gore"" sort of movie. You may think that it's not scary even though it's a horror movie. But this movie accomplishes what it sets out to do.
SHOCK. DISGUST. REVOLT. OUTRAGE. NAUSEATE. And sure as heck break a lotta ground.
FUN FACT:
The fact that this movie was made in 1985 and is still gorier than most movies today scares me more than the movie itself!
BOTTOM LINE:
DON'T expect someting brilliant like SUSPIRIA. DON'T expect something psychological like THE SHINING. This is a short film done just to be GORY AND NASTY! And it gets five stars from me! Have fun with this, and make sure you've eaten BEFORE you watch this! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1216080000,2,2408,4.658823529411765
7976692,3,B00007H24I,"The Guinea Pig series are supposedly based on some actual snuff film.  Flower of Flesh and Blood is the re-creation of those dastardly deeds.
This movie graphically shows a woman being kidnapped and hacked up to pieces.  It entails the steps of this tortuousous act in fairly realistic fashion.
However, I couldn't help but get the strong feeling of being manipulated.  This movie seems more like something some buddies threw together for fun.  Not the graphic depiction of a heinous crime.  Plus, I probably would have enjoyed this more if I hadn't previously seen Aftermath/Genesis, which is much more gruesome and realistic.
Still this is worth a look for you gore freaks...",1203206400,8,677,5.008928571428571
