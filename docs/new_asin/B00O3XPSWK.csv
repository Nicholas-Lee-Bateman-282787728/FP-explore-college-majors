8681920,5,B00O3XPSWK,"Another excellent film from South Korea. I saw this on NexFlix and bought it. I'm happy to have it for my collection.
it's one of those ones were it starts out good and then it keeps getting even better. there are quite a few twists but that's okay with me.
That's what I like about ones like this. the biggest twist of all for me was the mastermind who was behind everything. my eyes
and mouth were wide open. Yes I won't spoil it for you and Yes I'll let you watch and find out for yourself.
As I've read this was also based a true story that happen to couple on a boat. but of course alot of other stuff was
thrown in  to make the movie worth watching. anyway check out traffickers you won't be disapointed I wasn't.

in Korean Language with optional english subtitles

as previous costumer reviewers said there are no extras just some movie trailers from WELL GO USA",1430438400,2,870,4.2926829268292686
8681921,4,B00O3XPSWK,"Honeymooners Sang-ho (Daniel Choi) and Chae-hee (Ji-yoon Jeong) are traveling on a cruiser going from Incheon, South Korea to Weihai, China. Out on the high seas, the husband Sang-ho realizes that his wife (in a wheelchair) is missing.

On the same ship a black market dealer Yeong-gyoo (Chang Jung Lim) travels with three passengers. Yeong-gyoo, who once retired from the underground business he would rather not talk about, is called back to do the same job for the last time. What he doesnt know is that his last assignment involves someone he knows very well.

A 2012 Korean thriller Traffickers (Gong-mo-ja-deul) is reportedly inspired by a real-life incident about a Korean couple who got involved with an illegal human organ trafficking. I don't know the details of the event, and I am pretty sure that artistic liberties taken in making this thriller, which is dark and gripping, but requires lots of suspension of disbelief.

Directed by Hong-seon Kim (his feature debut), Traffickers is a disturbing thriller supported by fine acting and effective storytelling.",1422057600,,1071,5.179190751445087
8681922,4,B00O3XPSWK,"""Traffickers"" takes place during six hours on a passenger boat, with an ongoing black-market organ-trafficking operation and a desperate husband out to find his missing wife. Young-Gyu (Lim Chang Jung) is a former leader of a human organ trafficking group that smuggles body parts for sale to the highest bidder. His crew was the best -- an organized team of professionals with top skills and little in the way of conscience. But when one of them dies on the job, the crew scatters.

Now Young-Gyu fronts stolen goods and has fallen in love with a ticket agent at the port terminal. Her father is dying for want of an organ transplant. When she turns to a loan shark for help, Young-Gyu seeks out his old partners for one last job.

Though not technically a horror film, ""Traffickers"" contains a great deal of suspense, creepy atmosphere, and a host of unsavory characters. It's unusual to make the protagonist not merely an organ smuggler, but a sympathetic one. Young-Gyu is not your typical movie hero. He's not a man who's gone straight, and he expresses no apology or excuse for earning his living from illegal enterprises. Despite lapses in logic and over-dependence on coincidences,""Traffickers"" holds the viewer with a brisk pace and lots of action.

In Korean, with English subtitles, ""Traffickers"" contains no bonus extras.",1418860800,3,1333,4.968609865470852
