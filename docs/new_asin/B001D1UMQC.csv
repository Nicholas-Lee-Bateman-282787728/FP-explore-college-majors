8290968,5,B001D1UMQC,"Wonderful, heart-warming movie about an ordinary farmer who is killed, but comes back to help his family. Lee Majors does a marvelous job as the angel/spirit draped in gold farmer garb. Lee can really make you laugh and has great comedic timing to his character. Well done.",1459123200,,273,4.829787234042553
8290969,3,B001D1UMQC,"This movie is so country and corny i couldn't believe I got it. The story is silly,the plot doesn't make much sense and the movie made a joke of his acting career. Give them man some better movie roles than this,please.",1366156800,,219,4.365853658536586
8290970,1,B001D1UMQC,"Ever saw a bad movie with a great cast..well waitiin' to Live is a death trap of a movie.

Lee Major plays Bucko, a man who just died and turned into an angel only his son Junior can see. Barry (Northern  Exposure) Corbin tries to play like Boss Hogg of this small town who wants Bucko's propety. Reginald (Die Hard) Veljohnson plays Bucko's  best friend. Margaret (The Color Purple) Avery plays his wife. Allison Eastwood plays the Town tart..and with a cast like this is such a lame weak movie that you can see what happens a mile before it gets there.

The plot seems so simple and too dumb down for most. It has a cast of promise and it is soo bad, MISS at all costs!
