8702169,5,B00TKVQM2U,"This was the second of two events with Ring Of Honor & New Japan Pro Wrestling joining forces to present super shows with the first one being ""Global Wars"" where each company battled their own talent on the same show and this one where it was all inter-promotional matches titled ""War Of The Worlds"" while it should be noted that the PPV began with a rare in-ring moment for United States fans with all of the american members of the Bullet Club who were also champions (I.W.G.P. Champion A.J. Styles, ROH & I.W.G.P. Jr. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks, I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions Doc Gallows & Karl Anderson) in the same ring at the same time.

ACH, Matt Taven, Tommaso Ciampa vs. Forever Hooligans & Takaaki Watanabe - This was just a fun back & forth match that saw everyone having their moment to standout as a team with double & triple teaming or individually with different styles of wrestling & high flying including one person breaking out a move that nobody has seen from him in recent memory.

The Decade vs. Gedo & Jado - The Decade was represented by Roderick Strong & B.J. Whitmer who jumped their opponents right from the start singling out on of their opponents keeping him in their half of the ring working him over with grounded submissions while Gedo & Jado were able to use submissions of their own along with using their opponents against each other along with having no issues breaking the rules behind the referee's back themselves at one point as the match went back & forth with each team doing various double team combinations in a very good match.

ROH Television Champion Jay Lethal vs. Kushida - Both men had stalemates early on with each man having similar offense & ideas along with taking a page out of the other's playbook such as using different versions of dropkicks before Lethal resorted to dirty tactics to take control with holds like multiple suicide dives while also continuing to showoff such as taking a selfie during the match slowing the pace down before Kushida was able to use his athleticism to use offense from both different positions such as a springboard or top rope or just standing while having counters so Lethal's trademark offense as they traded momentum trading kicks & strikes along with executing some impactful moves from a tornado DDT to top rope frankensteiner resulting in a match that the crowd themselves described perfectly, ""THIS IS AWESOME!""

I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions Doc Gallows & Karl Anderson vs. Mark & Jay Briscoe - All four men started throwing punches right at the bell with the Briscoes either jumping over the top rope or off the apron onto the Bullet Club members on the floor as the fight continued with a table at ringside getting broken in the process before things settled back in the ring with the Bullet Club singling out one Briscoe keeping him in their half in the ring working him over in the corner with double team combinations while the Briscoes used their ""redneck kung-fu"" & double team tactics of their own as it came down to one team being able to quickly catch the other in a match that Kevin Kelly said was ""one hell of a fight.""

Kevin Steen vs. Shinsuke Nakamura - The crowd was chanting ""THIS IS AWESOME!"" before they even touched as they started trading fist at the bell with Steen getting the advantage using chops & even a dropkick while having fun at his opponent's expense while Nakamura used his trademark knee strikes to get the advantage to his advantage as both men were able to take advantage of mistiming by the other to get the momentum while trading forearms as Steen continued to use his weight advantage while Nakamura focused on the back area in a hard hitting match.

Michael Bennett vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi - Maria was at ringside with Kevin Kelly making the point that she said, ""they would do anything to win this match"" which was proven true as Maria attempted to give Bennett the first advantage only for Tanahashi to quickly rebound before Bennett was able to take advantage of an opening to not only knock Tanahashi to the floor but use the ringside environment to his advantage only for Tanahashi to use the same tactics as well as Bennett kept focusing on the lower back area with Maria constantly making her presence known whenever Tanahashi began to gain momentum working over Bennett's legs to the point where she got physically involved but not the way she imagined as they continued to trade momentum working over their specific body parts with Bennett continuing to do whatever he could do with such as using Maria & illegal tactics behind the referee's back while Tanahashi continued to deliver his offense from different parts from the top rope to the outside & the center of the ring & even on the apron as this was a different match than all the other's throughout the night that played into the story that Bennett was trying to do ""whatever it took to win"" with Maria's involvement adding to the match instead of taking away from it.

ROH Tag Team Champions Young Bucks vs. reDRagon - It should be noted that despite being double champions that only the ROH Tag Titles were on the line while reDRagon has UFC fighter Ton Lawlor in their corner who the Bucks got physical with in the opening minute only for Lawlor to get his receipt later on as both teams used double teaming tactics with the Bucks relying on various high flying moves & reDRagon grounding the Bucks with submissions & isolating one member of the team from his partner as both teams traded momentum with the Bucks relying on different high flying offense from the top rope & springboard positions going in & out of the ring including catching Kyle in mid-air with a superkick on the outside along with double team combinations such as a tornado DDT off the apron immediately followed by a springboard X-Factor into the ring while reDRagon was able to counter the Bucks' attempted double teaming into submissions while showing they have no issues using high flying moves of their own along with both teams using their opponents against each other & having some very unique counters to signature moves as they just went back & forth non-stop with impact resulting in what was not only the match of the night but voted as the ROH match of the year.

ROH Champion Adam Cole vs. Jushin Liger - Liger started out in control using mat wrestling using holds such as a hammerlock & side headlock along with different grounded submission trying up all parts of the body to the point where Cole had to literally bite the bottom rope to get a break before Cole was finally able to catch Liger & work him over using grounded offense of his own along with hard whips in the corner before Liger responded with top rope offense along with impactful moves that turned Cole inside out before Cole was able to heavily work over a specific part of the body while also taking advantage of whatever he could to block Liger's attempt at offense in a match that was showcased each man being very focused & calculating.

I.W.G.P. Champion A.J. Styles vs. Kazuchika Okada vs. Michael Elgin - A fun fact that Steve Corino mentioned on commentary that this was the first triple threat match for this championship since Brock Lesnar's title win in 2005.  All three started trading kicks in the opening seconds with the match before each man attempted at one point to use the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" eliminating one opponent to the outside in order to focus soley on the other leading to some unique interactions such as Elgin executing his delayed vertical suplex with the third opponent trying to break it only for Elgin to keep him elevated, various moves from the top rope taking out two opponents at once, one man's unique variation of a figure four leglock, Elgin showcasing his strength taking out both opponents at one time & even using one against the other, one man executing an offensive move only to leave himself open for the third opponent to immediately catch him with one of their own maneuver on more than one occasion, each man deliver impactful moves from a lariat to tombstone piledriver, and the winner of the match being able to capitalize on an opening his other opponent did with the bigger picture being at the end of the night who was left standing raising THEIR championship.

2014 was definitely the greatest year for japanese wrestling in the United States since New Japan's talent exchange with WCW in the early to mid 1990's with different companies exchanging talent  (i.e. ROH/New Japan & TNA/Wrestle-1) leading to crossover appearances on different events along with joint super shows (TNA's ""One Night Only: Global Impact"" & ""Bound For Glory"" & ROH's ""Global Wars"") but I felt this was definitely the best super show of the year with each match being quality of their own resulting in a card that I would absolutely go out of my way to see as this was my favorite event of the year.",1426118400,,8898,4.682225063938619
