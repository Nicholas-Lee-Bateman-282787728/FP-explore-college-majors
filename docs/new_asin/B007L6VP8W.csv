5094198,4,B007L6VP8W,"I know I've said it before but I will say it again...me and supernatural horror movies don't really get along. I find them to be tediously plodding and incredibly boring. For every classic supernatural thriller like Poltergeist we must sit through five Paranormal Activity 3's. I just don't find the subgenre very interesting. I know that others can make the same case against slashers. I mean, let's be honest here, most slashers really are a guy in a mask chopping up attractive teens. Nonetheless, at least in the slasher subgenre we can at least look forward to some creative deaths. In supernatural horror it normally is just a bunch of doors slamming and we are lucky if ANYONE dies. So, why this diatribe against supernatural films? Well, I figured I should give you a little bit of background on my relationship with supernatural films before digging into the supernatural horror film of the night, The Silent House. Let's just say that I had low expectations going into this film as it has been years since I've seen a good film from this subgenre. Did The Silent House live up to my low expectations? Let us start at the beginning...

The Silent House begins with a young woman named Sarah (in a brilliant, tour-de-force performance by the unstoppable Elizabeth Olsen) is staying at a lakeside house in the country with her father, John (Adam Trese), and Uncle Peter (Eric Sheffer Stevens), fixing it up in preparation for sale. Due to fighting between the men, her uncle takes a break, driving to town in his car, leaving Sarah and her father alone in the house. A knock is heard at the door and, since her father is upstairs working, Sarah answers. The visitor is a friendly young woman about Sarah's age, named Sophia (Julia Taylor Ross), who claims to be one of Sarah's childhood friends. Sarah doesn't remember her and Sophia suggests they meet again later. Sarah agrees and the girl leaves.

Soon after, Sarah hears strange noises upstairs and notifies her father. He goes upstairs to see if anything is wrong, but finds nothing. Sarah, calmed by her father, goes to her room to pack. Not long afterward, she hears him walking down the stairs, falling, then nothing. She frantically searches for him and finds him unconscious with a bloody wound on his head. He appears to have been deliberately knocked out. Sarah tries to escape from the house, but all doors are locked or boarded up. She goes back to her father's unconscious body to get the only key to the front door, but he is gone. She runs to the basement and finds a bed and other human necessities indicating someone had been living downstairs. Panicking, she sees a figure shining a light in the basement, looking for her. Will Sarah survive the night?

Is the house haunted? Are these spirits being imagined by Sarah? Is someone out to get here? To answer these questions would spoil the fun of the movie. And yes dear reader, much to my surprise, this movie is indeed a hell of a lot of fun. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I thought the cuts in the movie were seamless and it really did feel as though the movie was being shot in real time. The movie had a sense of fear and dread that have been missing from the Paranormal movies with some great imagery. Elizabeth Olsen was amazing in this film and after Martha Marcy May Marlene, she has risen to the top of my young actors to watch list. That's not to say that everything in the movie works. With the expectation of Olsen, the other actors all come off a little hammy, overacting to a sometimes hilarious degree. The geography of the house is never very clear and it is sometimes very hard to figure out just what room each of the characters are in and even what floor they are on. There will be some viewers who will take offense to the ending or, rather, lack thereof. None of these flaws make me like the movie any less. This is an imperfect film but also one that takes a lot of chances and actually requires intelligence from its audience. It's nice to see what I've been missing.",1337990400,5,4027,4.590277777777778
5094199,5,B007L6VP8W,"I happened to catch the original Uruguayan Silent House just by chance flipping through channels on late night TV.  I was captivated.  I'm a complete Horror freak, and the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.  I LOVED the continuous camera sweep (ala Russian Ark), and the acting was superb.  I don't scare easily, and I rarely jump at the typical scares in horror flicks, but this movie got the best of me a few times.  After watching it, I immediately logged on to Amazon to order the original Uruguayan movie.

Sure as anything, I soon found out that there was a US remake coming out.  As far as I'm concerned, there is very little talent in Hollywood, and it's a common trend to just remake popular movies to cash in on their success.  I was very skeptical, but because I loved the original, I decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed.

Elizabeth Olsen is not of the same strain of her twin sisters who have ridden the wave of their childhood fame for being cute babies.  She actually acts in Silent House, and very well.  Even though I had seen the original, and I knew what to expect, I still jumped...several times.

Excellent acting, a great creepy story, and wonderful camera work.  Naturally the pompous Hollywood director thought he could improve on the original version by slightly changing the storyline (the Uruguayan version was fine the way it was), but even with the changes, the movie was excellent.  From the acting, the creepy basement scene, to the music used to set the mood...excellent remake of an already great movie.

I suggest watching both to compare.",1337731200,39,1611,4.6
5094200,1,B007L6VP8W,I'm sorry but personally this movie sucked so bad and it was so drawn out and it wasn't at all worth watching. I watched it in theaters and i definetly will not buy it when it comes out... This movie was so stupid it was unreal.. I rate it a 1 out of 5 for at least trying to direct it...,1337644800,2,288,3.737704918032787
5094201,2,B007L6VP8W,"""Who are you, why are you doing this to us?"" After being left alone Sarah (Olsen) begins to hear strange noises in her house. Little by little things begin to get stranger and more terrifying to her. When she finds her father in a pool of blood she runs to find her uncle. After they find her father missing things get worse. This movie had a neat gimmick to me. One long continuous shot and filmed in real time. That sounded like a cool idea. But like most movies lately the idea's are much better then the actual thing. It may be because I am an older age then the movie is targeting but to me this movie was just one long boring scene after another. The movie is pretty much Sarah in the dark screaming. The twist at the end was pretty neat and made me like the movie a little more then I had been but still not enough to recommend it highly. Overall, a disappointing horror movie that again is geared toward the younger crowd. Not for me. I give it a C-.",1336521600,11,958,4.155913978494624
5094202,1,B007L6VP8W,"I hated this movie. Well, I hated the first hour, at any rate, and when I realised it had no intention of trying to get better, I walked out. I was not the first person in the screening to do so.

The film is, in its way, technically ambitious, the whole thing ostensibly a single take (apparently shot on a high-end Canon DSLR, hence the super-narrow depth of field), in the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russian-Ark/dp/B0000ALPJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russian Ark</a>. But Russian Ark is a unique achievement (and a very different film). This is no Russian Ark.

It seems unlikely director Chris Kentis really pulled this off in a single take - there are regular static scenes where a cut would have been quite easy to get away with (and in any case a second camera guy gets a credit!) As this technique is merely verisimilitude, not the real thing, you get none of the points for difficulty, but you constrain yourself to a very distracting idiom: generally long unbroken shots are a risky strategy (famously&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonfire-of-the-Vanities/dp/B000HF2Q6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonfire of the Vanities</a>&nbsp;bombed on account of an ambitious long single opening shot, though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Player/dp/B000YMJ7SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Player</a>&nbsp;had less trouble).

Here it works to an extent, but after a while you long for a reverse angle, or a fast cut, a wide shot, or something to break up the travel-sickness of following the actors around at close quarters.

Besides, there is a covenant struck between film-maker and audience which Chris Kentis ignores. We suspend disbelief, but in return the film-maker provides us with a credible set of characters and articulates their motivations. It is the screenplaywright's task to frame those motivations and that dialogue in an imaginary world, the scriptwriters' to stage manage that journey, and the actors' to inhabit those characters and propel them plausibly around the set.

Those obligations fulfilled, the director of principal photography, the sound effects guy, the editor and ultimately the director can have a bit of fun giving us a thrill: with their enterprise they've earned that right, and our corresponding emotional investment in their imaginary world and these characters piques our excitement at the chase.

In Silent House, no such consideration is paid. We meet three characters: a teenaged daughter, her father and her uncle, none of whom we are inclined to like. They wander around a delapidated summer house sniping caustically at each other. They try to tidy it up for sale. Why, we do not know. Why there is an uncle and not a mother, we do not know. Conveniently, the power is off (rats in the roof) and the windows have all been boarded up (local vandals). Inside the house is dark and damp and, as it transpires, quite hard to get out of should you lose your key.

Before long there's a petty argument: of the three characters, one leaves, one is rendered unconscious by a nasty bump on the head, mysteriously inflicted, and one - you'll never guess who - is left alone, stripped down to a singlet with a plunging neckline, and stranded inside a dark, locked house. Things begin to go bump.

For the next twenty minutes we follow Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) and more particularly her impressive dcolletage around the house as she hyperventillates at the thought that someone might be in there with her. In fairness, Olsen's performance is technically adept, even impressive, but the show is well and truly stolen by her chest.

Olsen's cleavage takes on a life of its own: as if it is some sort of gravity well, the camera is drawn in; the fecund orbs flicker moodily in the light of a nearby guttering candle; we hover vertiginously over this inviting canyon as she leans over her unconscious father; his blood is conveniently smeared smuttily around as she whimpers. You may think my interest seems voyeuristic, but in the Cartesian theatre we occupy behind Igor Martinovic's lens, a red-blooded fellow has no choice. I won't deny I've had less agreeable visual experiences, but I was under no illusion how cynically my male animal vapours were being exploited. The film-maker's covenant states you must at least try to pretend it is otherwise. Covenant breached.

It occurred to me, also, that Kentis relies on just one dimension for his film to pass muster: A scared girl in a state of semi-undress being spooked by things she cannot see. There is no dialogue at all for 30 minutes: just panicked breathing. Were someone listening from outside the theatre he might well surmise it was porn. He wouldn't be far wrong. It felt to me like a film-maker's exercise; a drill in how to create suspense using only a tracking camera, low light and a fruity teenager. It didn't quite feel like a whole film.

Sarah's initial escape from the house, in which she had been fightened out of her living wits for a half hour, is short-lived: she is rescued by her uncle, driven back to the house, left outside and then, at the merest provocation, she runs back inside and locks the door behind her! At this point, with any pretence of the film maker's covenant in tatters and my intelligence handsomely insulted, I decided I had better things to do.

I should concede, having subsequently researched it, that the plot unfolds in a way which explains Sarah's decision to re-enter the house, but only by fundamentally undermining the first hour of the film, and the general consensus is that the film deteriorates markedly in the second half. That is quite an achievement, if true, but in any case I don't feel unjustified in panning a film only half of which I've seen. Half was quite enough.

5094203,2,B007L6VP8W,"Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) helps her dad (Adam Trese) and creepy uncle (Eric Sheffer Stevens, ""My have you grown Sarah"") clean up an old family lake house for resale. The cousins didn't want to help. Sarah has very little memory of the place as a child and doesn't even remember the neighbor girl who she played with...hmmm. The house has been vandalized and appears to have rodent damage which prevents the use of electricity. It is unnaturally pitch black dark inside, even during the day because the house is boarded up and of course they don't have cell phone reception. Between these few clues and the title of the film, we know which direction the film is going to take, just not the details. Yawn.

Sarah becomes unnerved by things that go bump in the night and much of the film is dark or poorly lit with camera angels that focus on Sarah's cleavage. When they are not focused on her cleavage, they are extremely bad amateur angels that distracted from the film instead of enhancing it. Might work as a rental if you ran out of paint to watch dry. A fair film made bad by a director trying out gimmicks.

5094204,4,B007L6VP8W,"A young woman who is moving out of an old home with her father begins seeing and hearing unexplained things. She is extremely frightened as she runs from whatever or whoever may be lurking. Featuring the highly talented Elizabeth Olsen, this movie is quite scary up until the final minutes when the story takes an unexpected turn. This is when the film loses something, but it does distinguish it as more than just a standard horror film. I found the movie very frightening and unpredictable. Liz Olsen is such a talent, she is able to project true fright throughout, and the film is able to maintain this until the surprising conclusion. Overall, this is a solid effort in the horror genre.",1334016000,25,691,4.7190082644628095
5094205,2,B007L6VP8W,"Remaking Gustavo Hernandez's inventive Uruguayan thriller, La Casa Muda, proves an interesting technical challenge. The film, which debuted at Cannes back in 2010, was widely praised for it's tight, real time conceit, shot in one single take. It's a practice that we see used frequently in bits and pieces, but with the exception of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope not often as a feature film standard. Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, who made a splash nine years ago with their low budget deep sea thriller, Open Water, have stuck nearly shot-for-shot with Hernandez's film with Silent House, and in doing so are subject to many of the same failings surrounding a poorly delivered ""twist"" that undermines literally everything that came before it.

One of two films at last year's Sundance Film Festival that rocketed Elizabeth Olsen into superstardom, the other being Martha Marcy May Marlene, she gives an equally fractious but far less compelling performance as Sarah, a young woman who along with her father and uncle attempt to repair and resell their old home. The creep factor sets in almost from the very beginning, not just from the broken windows, squeaky floorboards, and lack of electricity forcing the use of candlelight, but Sarah's uncle seems especially concerned about her well being. There's something not quite right with her, and the touch 'n go treatment by her family only makes it more obvious.

The arrival of a persistent neighbor girl Sarah can't quite remember is basically the signal to let the terror begin. What starts as Sarah seeming to be a little paranoid over the occasional bump in the dark, quickly escalates into bloody violence. Her father is attacked and left for dead, somebody is stalking the darkened hallways looking for another victim. Is it a squatter, looking to keep the dilapidated building for himself? Or is it something more than that?

Kentis creates a perfect sense of dread, with the boarded up windows allowing the most minimal of light to penetrate, giving the impression of being trapped in a deep cavern. Subsequently, the few times Sarah actually bursts forth to the outside, you feel as if you yourself have escaped the darkness along with her, racing along through the herky jerky shaky cam. It actually works in this case, giving the film an uncomfortable oppressiveness that'll likely cause a few chills.

Getting to that point is excruciating slow, highlighting one of the drawbacks of the single shot technique. Breaking out of a tonal comfort zone is difficult enough for most directors to pull off in an organic way, but when you don't have the luxury of cutting elsewhere it's exceedingly difficult. Whether or not Kentis and Lau actually hold true to the real time gimmick is anybody's guess, but it certainly looks like they have. There's nothing wrong with the film technically, but as boredom settles in you'll probably spend more time looking for scene cuts than watching Sarah burst into tears for the umpteenth time.

Olsen is good enough in her role, although it's unclear to me what the big fuss was about, because the role itself is extremely weak. The film hinges on a shocker twist that won't be spoiled here, even though it's basically given away early on by Oscar Estevez's poorly managed script. Without the benefit of surprise, Silent House is little more than a mediocre horror, enough to appease fans of the genre but not much else.",1332288000,3,3407,4.9597197898423815
5094206,4,B007L6VP8W,"just saw the movie last night in Tuscaloosa.  The film is in essence the story of a father, and his daughter who go to the country to restore an old family home in hopes of selling it.

without giving away spoiler plot points, the daughter and father become trapped in the house and must find a way to survive and get  out of the house alive.

the film reminded me of ""The Blair Witch Project"" which was released in 1999, in that the camera style is ""point of view"" perspective (long continuous takes, camera follows the actors around) and you are ""right there"" with the actors.  This too was more recently done with the film ""Cloverfield"".  This type of filming (P.O.V.) works particularly well with horror or suspense type films, because is gives the audience a claustrophobic emotional feel, which creates fear and tension.  The sounds effects were well done; where a knock on the door, a thud from the attic, or something being smashed in the cellar notches up the fear considerably.

so if you enjoyed those other two mentioned films, you will like the feel of this one.  Elizabeth Olsen gives an electric performance as the terrified, tormented victim.  Very satisfying performance. A talent to watch for in the years to come.",1331942400,10,1232,4.714953271028038

I will admit that it wasn't what I was expecting, but it made perfect sense given the title of the movie.  It also left me thinking, which is not always the case for a horror film.  Some reviewers were critical of the shakiness of the camera, but I felt this was a strength rather than a limitation.

Julia Taylor Ross is also memorable as Sarah's childhood friend, Sophia, a tangential but ultimately important character.

Though nothing spectacular, SILENT HOUSE was a pleasant--if that's the word for it (?)--surprise. The general premise doesn't look all that promising, but the creators did about the best job possible in making this film go in some unexpected directions. Despite the occasional tiresome wavering camera tricks, it's well-filmed and is one of those movies that would not have really benefited from a higher budget and that a wider scope with more complications would have hindered rather than improved. Good simple suspense, in other words. It somehow manages to use standard horror tropes--mirrors, the question of what lies behind the curtain, etc--that are usually same ol' stuff very well. The foreshadowings at the beginning--particularly in Dad's and Uncle Peter's scripts--are well-done and important to the plot of the film. Even though it doesn't tie up quite as neatly as it could, SILENT HOUSE does not end exactly the way you probably think it will.",1399593600,,1557,5.765217391304348

I got ""Lost in Translation"" have mercy! I know a lot of horror movies as well as just plain ole scary drama movies don't make a lot of sense but this one I just couldn't make heads or tales with. The beginning made perfect sense at first but as the night came and the ""horror"" began that's when I got totally lost. Didn't understand what was going on and who was who. I kept thinking, is the girl (Olsen's main character) the one who's killing everyone and scaring everyone or is it someone else and that's why she's so afraid. Forget this movie! Wish I had never purchased it. I love ""The Strangers"" with Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler. Now that's SCARY and makes sense! I have watched that one many times over and still love it.

Will give this movie to my best friend in hopes she'll like it and can make some sense of it and explain it to me.
Note to add: E. Olsen is a really good actress even in this weird flick but she could do much better than this. I can see her in a mystery drama playing the lead role and something that's very meaningful and powerful but a movie like this just lowered her standard of acting. Hopefully it hasn't gone against her for really good future roles. I wouldn't have even accepted the role if I had been her. Just a sorry movie.

5094280,3,B007L6VP8W,"A lot of people liked the French thriller ""High Tension."" I watched it and liked it up to the part where a particular plot point kicked in that pretty much ruined the entire experience for me. ""Silent House"" pulls that same boner.

Here's the scoop. Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) is at her family's remote summer home with her dad and uncle. They're working on the place to get it up to spec for selling purposes. She begins to sense there is someone in the house with less than good intentions. Her fears are soon realized and now she's in for the fight of her life.

There is so much here to like. It appears the film makers used the 'single take' technique from the original and it does lend a certain immediacy to the proceedings. Also is Olsen's performance. This may be the first time I felt that close to experiencing a character's abject fear. I was scared for her. And with the camera following her around so closely it made the fear even more palpable. Then there are the Polaroids that both her father and uncle find but are unwilling to share. And who's the neighbor girl? Does Sarah really remember her or does she merely not want to seem dumb or uncaring? Things seen as vague shadowy figures. The heavy footfalls. All these make for a truly unsettling experience. But late in the third act they pull a 180 on what is happening and it totally blew it for me. It simply made no sense given everything that came before. The acting, directing, sound, seamless editing were all top of the line. Were it not for the one mis-step, this could have been a real contender.

Much of the 'action' if you can call it that, was outright boring, and if Sarah's solo 'panting' scenes had been 'true to life,' she would have hyperventilated, had an asthma attack, or fainted flat on her face. I couldn't count the times when I knew what Sarah and her Father were going to say before they said their lines. And once I figured out where the story was going and had a good idea how the film would end - which didn't take long - I ejected the rented Silent House DVD, and chalked it up as a waste of my time and money. And I learned later that I was right about the ending.

Directed by Chris Kentis and Laura Lau - director and producer of ""Open Water"" respectively - ""Silent House"" starts out pretty well as a thriller, but soon we notice the story goes nowhere ... until the final act where you are in for a few disturbing discoveries. Sorry, but they arrive too late.

""Silent House"" is a remake of a Uruguayan film ""La casa muda"". Like the original, the remake was filmed in real time in a single long take (well, in fact, the film was edited to look like that). If you have seen Hitchcock's 1948 film ""Rope,"" you know what I mean.

Now, here is a problem. I don't see the point of shooting an entire film in one continuous take, especially when the film centers on fear of someone in an unusual situation. We are interested in that situation and the person's reaction to it. As the filmmakers stick to the narrative gimmick, the film loses its rhythm. Scenes start to drag. Actors act a bit too long, even though acting from Elizabeth Olsen (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") itself is very strong.

""Silent House"" is strictly for Elizabeth Olsen fans or those who are interested in technical aspects of the film. If you are looking for a thriller, ""Silent House"" is not the place.",1372896000,,1534,4.608058608058608

I appreciated the effort and care put into that neat little convention. It feels different from most thrillers or horror films in that way.

5094297,1,B007L6VP8W,"Silent House (Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, 2011)

I was a huge fan of--and I remain a staunch defender of--Kentis and Lau's first feature, Open Water. So when I heard they'd signed on to do a remake of the microbudget Uruguyan flick La Casa Muda, I was cautiously optimistic; the first two-thirds of the original are creepy and effective, but it's all blown to shreds by the horrific plot holes in the final third, and I was hoping that a reworked script could address some of the problems there and come up with something exciting.

Well, we did get a reworked script from Lau--one that left all the problems in the movie's final third, but cut everything good out of the first two-thirds. I knew things were going to go sour right around the time that everyone tromped upstairs without Peter (Julie and Julia's Eric Sheffer Stevens, reprising the role played by Gustavo Alonso in the original) warning them not to go upstairs because of structural problems. It seems like such a little thing, but in the original movie, that's the mechanism on which the tension of much of the first half of the film turns--Laura/Sarah (played here by Martha Macy May Marlene's Elizabeth Olsen) starts hearing noises coming from upstairs, and dad (Zodiac's Adam Trese) goes up to check them out. When you hear that inevitable scream-thump combo, is there a killer in the house, or did he get caught by a structural defect? It makes the decision Laura (in the original) is faced with--whether to go up there and find out what happened or not--a whole lot more important.

As well, as I mentioned in my review of the original, much of the middle third of the turns on Florencia Colucci's performance, because she's the only person onscreen for approximately forty minutes of the film. That section, an exercise in tension (if not a fully-realized one) in the original, is stripped as close to the bone as possible in Lau's reworked script. Did she not think Olson--a proven commodity, one notes, where Colucci wasn't--was up to being a solo performer for forty minutes? That's the only explanation I can come up with for cutting out so many of the original's most effective scenes. It was a bad decision indeed.

But I was willing to work with it, as long as they closed up some of the original's plot holes and had the last third of the movie make some semblance of sense. However, nope, they couldn't even manage to get that right. If anything, the final sequences here are even more muddled. But then, given that the rest of the film is senseless, it makes sense the ending would be, as well. It's not the worst Hollywood remake of a horror film I've ever seen--the twin desecrations of It's Alive and Friday the 13th may hold that distinction forevermore--but it's somewhere in the bottom ten.

Yes it's one continuous shot, like ""Rope"".  It's very well done, even if there are moments where there could have been an edit, I don't think so.  The ability of the actors and crew to pull this off is, by itself, mind boggling and a testament to their skill.
As to the movie, well how much character development do you expect in any 88-minute period in a person's life?  There's basically none of that - it's purely voyeurism of this young lady's experience.  I call it art house because of that aspect. The thing I love is it's like those first-person POV horror flicks without the conceit of ""hey I just feel like carrying this camera around and pointing it at everything happening around me even if it puts my life at risk. And aren't I amazing? I never trip over anything!""  haha.

Chris Kentis and Laura Lau of OPEN WATER fame stage the action in real time, using clever editing techniques to disguise their cuts while creating the illusion that the entire film has been performed in a single shot. Kentis and Lau experiment with as many different angles and framing methods as they can realistically achieve given these stylistic constraints, and although this frequently removes the viewer from the false sense of reality, any film maker can appreciate the effort and creativity that is being employed on screen. What this hand-held technique does provide is a level of uncomfortability and voyeuristic intrusion in to the events, forcing the audience inside the room as we creep down the dark and dangerous hallways right alongside Sarah. Elizabeth Olson gives another excellent performance as Sarah, whose sheer terror and vulnerability rattle us to the bone. SILENT HOUSE comes out a big winner in the scare department while greatly impressing with its unique approach to film making.

My mom randomly picked it up one evening, and I rented it again so my sister could watch it.
The way it was filmed (long, unedited shot) keeps you hooked.
You feel as if you are with Elizabeth Olsen's character.  Her talent of portraying fear pulls you in as well.
Don't expect too much craziness--it's more of a story that builds up fear of the unknown.",1355097600,,380,4.352112676056338

5094340,3,B007L6VP8W,"There's equal parts good and bad here. The good: the acting is superb and the filmmaking is clearly talented. The entire movie is one 88 minute continuous shot. I respect how hard that must have been to make and the fact the acting wasn't lost as the movie went on proved the actors/director all have talent.

That said, the bad: It's frustrating when you keep hearing a woman get startled and screaming and never really getting a decent look at what she's running from. Ghosts? Monsters? Burglars? What? Normally I like a movie to keep a few secrets to keep an element of mystery, but in this case it doesn't work well for me. I kept running it back at first to try to see and gave up and no more is given as the movie goes on. Second, it's repetitive. Run over here... she hears a noise, screams and runs away. Lather, rinse repeat... I think a bit of the plot was sacrificed for the sake of making an 88 minute long movie as a continual shot.

Third, and not the movie makers fault was reading too many detailed reviews first. They gave too much away and I was expecting several parts of the ending. Otherwise I wouldn't have seen it coming and had a bit better experience. I gave an extra star based on the fact that if I hadn't known, i probably would have liked it more.",1354665600,2,1276,4.3125
5094341,3,B007L6VP8W,"There were a couple reasons I sought out this remake of an Ecuadorian horror film.  First the directors/writer combo of Chris Kentis and Laura Lau who were so effective in the tension filled ""Open Water,"" and second, Elizabeth Olsen who did all she could to save the uneven ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" in 2011.

Olsen is the real deal and virtually every scene has the camera focused on her and her low-cut shirt.  Olsen is Sarah who is helping her dad (Adam Trese) and uncle (Eric Sheffer Stevens) clear out an old lakeside second home after years of neglect.  Pretty quickly hunky Uncle Peter acknowledges how much Sarah has grown.  Hmm.  After he heads out on an errand, the house goes into the conventional strange noises, thumps and all things that go bump in the night routine.  Oh, and the electricity is out in the house which must have 5 or 6 floors based on Sarah's search for the suddenly missing dad.

After she spots strangers in the here-one-second-gone-the-next style of many horror films, she finds she is locked in and can't escape.  There is a story twist at the end, but if you've been paying attention you will probably see it coming.  I found nothing special in the movie.  Disappointing.

This Blu ray transfer comes in the usual 1080p using a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  I'm not usually very snobby when it comes to the picture but this one shows some flaws.  While not a ""found footage"" style film the directors do use primarily hand held hi-def cameras.  It may be hard to tell what is a mistake and what was intended but for my money, the overall quality was below what you normally see.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and while there is plenty of effect opportunities, overall I would say the soundfield is adequate.",1354665600,,1743,4.6103896103896105

The lead character does a pretty decent job and carries the film well. The Uncle on the other hand could have been better, but to each his own I suppose.

Overall this movie is worth a rental, not sure if its worth buying, because I am not sure there is much replay value in it, but that goes for just about any thriller. Hope this helped!",1354406400,,612,4.008196721311475

5094345,2,B007L6VP8W,"I recently decided to stream this on Netflix (available as of 11/24/12), although I didn't know much about the film except for it having a theatrical release. Silent House follows Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) as she is terrorized by an unknown person while cleaning out her vacation home along with her father and uncle. Unfortunately, Silent House is a (mostly) generic horror film.

First, the story is not exactly original or innovative, although it's shooting style is. I'd identify it as a psychological horror film; if you've watched many horror films in your time and have heard this genre/term before, you can probably see the ending coming from a mile away. It does pack a few decent jump scares throughout, and some redeeming tension. Yet, it follows a very simple formula you may notice right away and may not like; this is basically how the movie goes: run, hide, cry, repeat (over and over), and it gets old quick. However, I do appreciate the ""single-continuous shot"" style, it added to the tension and helped set the film apart from the many other modern horror films; it's kind of like a found-footage film where the camera shakes often and you can't actual see what you're supposed to be scared of at all times, I should note. The camera shakes ferociously when she runs (and she runs often), which was a bit annoying and I can see it being annoying to those prone to motion sickness. The acting was good overall; although I felt Elizabeth Olsen overacted a few times, she did very well.

Overall, Silent House has some decent scares and some great tension, but the dreadful repetitiveness and extremely predictable ending hurt the film significantly. It probably would've been a lot better as a short film. I recommend streaming (if you can), or a cheap rental before purchasing.

Silent House has some violence and blood. No sex or nudity. (most of the violence is off-screen)",1353715200,,1890,4.827160493827161

5094383,5,B007L6VP8W,"Let me start by saying that this is the first online review I've ever done. THAT'S how good this movie is.

We were searching for a good scare on Amazon via our Roku set up. We are very picky about our fright fests around here. My daughter and I prefer a realistic scare, something that could really happen is always more terrifying to us.  We laugh at fictional creatures and gag at gore.

I will tell you this: Get ready to be on the edge of your seat and if you have any medical conditions, this might not be the movie for you. My heart was just pounding through the entire movie.

Elizabeth Olson was amazing and I venture to say 10 times the actress that her older much more famous twin sisters could ever aspire to be.

This movie was a ""continuous"" shoot, no back and forth from scene to scene. It followed the actress without a single pause. The shoot mode and Olsen's convincing portrayal result in RELENTLESS adrenaline flow and heart palpitations! I'm telling you that we almost breathed a sigh of relief when the movie was over just so our hearts could go back to their normal place of residence rather than vacationing in our throats!!

For a movie that we hadn't really heard of, didn't remember seeing the trailers to on TV and weren't really leaning towards watching...we were very surprised and truly terrified.

Watch this movie....we highly recommend it. We also highly recommend you don't watch it alone...muah-ah-ahhhhh!!",1351814400,3,1442,4.653543307086614

It is a sparse type of film. Some people might not like that kind of thing. I'm surprised by all the negative reviews because I really think it's a cut above. I'm guessing this is because American audiences (and face it we're not that smart) find it dull?

:Spoiler: In the end the subject matter is dark enough to make me not recommend the film to friends. It's almost a subject that shouldn't appear in a film for kicks.

5094410,4,B007L6VP8W,"I've been keeping my eye out for more films with Elizabeth Olsen, who absolutely captivated with her fantastic performance in MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE, and when I heard about her role in Chris Kentis and Laura Lau's intense thriller SILENT HOUSE, I felt it was a must-see, and when I finally did, I didn't read too many of the reviews here so that I could keep an open mind going in and not to have anything spoiled for me (which, frankly, Amazon reviewers are won't to do). When I came out of it, I was surprised at how tense my muscles had become while watching, because this is a film that once started doesn't let go.

Working with a ""one take"" narrative device, the film focuses on Olsen, her father and her uncle as they are cleaning out their huge old summer home to sell. The house is without power and runs on generators, portable lanterns and good old-fashioned candlepower. There seems to be a good family vibe as they explore the areas of the vast house, until a noise is heard upstairs, when there shouldn't be one. Logical explanations are posited, but suddenly the terror begins as it appears intruders have entered the house intent on nothing other than doing harm and psychologically torturing the poor young woman. The film becomes less about story and more about the ultimate voyeuristic exercise, since the camera forces us to follow around Olsen as her terror becomes more and more amplified and we truly get to experience all of the various emotions of her performance since Kentis and Lau employed this unusual narrative device. When the truth of the situation begins to reveal itself, it may seem like some to be a twist that is reminiscent of Alexandre Aja's HIGH TENSION, but in truth, this is much better because you feel that this destination was something the film was heading towards as opposed to a ""shocking twist"" designed because the filmmakers couldn't figure out how to end this.

It's hard to point out any particularly effective sequences because the film is all one sequence really, although it does have a three-act-structure. Kentis and Lau obviously employ some very smart technical wizardry to this film because you really can't tell (or at least it's not obvious) where the film does have cuts. There are moments, such as the darkening of the room and in REAR WINDOW-esque fashion, Olsen uses an older-fashioned Polariod Instant Camera to illuminate her surroundings. The final act transition is something that is totally fluid and pretty breathtaking to behold, not only on a technical but on a performance level as well. The film does feel like several different films are being paid homage to, particularly Hitchcock's ROPE with the unbroken narrative, as well as any number of spooky old house films and home invasion fright-fests like THE STRANGERS and HAPPY GAMES and even PSYCHO, which again speaks to the very Hitchcockian element to this film and the understanding of Hitchcock's understanding of making audiences feel terror by making them something of active participants in the terror, which is no small feat.

Olsen, who's absolutely the centerpiece of the film, creates an incredible anchor in her performance in this film. There's never a moment that seems inauthentic to her character, and there's never a moment where I felt that she was doing the absolutely wrong thing, even though logic might suggest otherwise. Logic very rarely presents itself in a situation like this. The vastness of the house becomes a character as well as new nooks are discovered through her hiding and running. Also the camera becomes its own character as it shifts points-of-view from first to third and back again. It invites us in to a place that we don't necessarily want to go because of the terror that this young girl is feeling and the lack of reason behind it initially. Who here is suspect?

The disconnect, I believe, for the audience at large is they went into this film expecting Horror Story A and then got Psychological Thriller Story B. This is a film that gives a very pervasive feel of dread all throughout, and frankly that's part of where the film had me AND lost me at the same time. It's impossible to please everyone all of the time, and this film, while mostly very impressive, didn't give enough chances for the audience to breathe. I absolutely understand why they chose to do it that way, but if you give the audience a chance to catch their breath from the constant nerve-jagnling tone, the more terrifying the film ultimately becomes when you allow for even just a brief moment of levity.

Aside from that complaint, I have to highly recommend SILENT HOUSE for people who are more fans of cinema and less fans of scary films, much like another recent release THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, which is very much not for the casual horror fan. If you allow yourself into SILENT HOUSE, you'll find you have much more reason to leave than to stay, but you also won't be able to help yourself.",1350604800,,4947,4.76779463243874
5094411,5,B007L6VP8W,"Elizabeth Olsen delivers an incredibly emotional and believable performance in this film. Based on that I immediately put another of her films Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011) at the top of my Netflix queue.

The movie is presented in real time with no visible cuts, and I thoroughly enjoyed pondering the complexities inherent in this method. The camera operators (and sound engineers, and grips) delivered quite a physical performance as well, running after Olsen at top speed up and down stairs, in and out of the house, in tight and tiny spaces, all while coordinating precise planned camera moves with on-screen talent and pulling very shallow focus throughout.  For a geek or production buff, this alone will make the movie quite enjoyable on its own merit.

When considering the fact that there are no (visible) cuts, we understand that what we're seeing is done in extremely long takes.  I assumed that this would impact the director's ability (or willingness) to tweak performances. In other films, a director can have actors deliver a fifteen-second sequence dozens of times if necessary. Not so with the 10 to 15 minute takes seen here. Olsen's delivery was excellent throughout, but I was slightly less impressed with the other on-screen characters' performances. It would be hard to say if the storytelling method is to blame, but it's worth a thought.

Intense suspense reigns for about 85% of the film, and there are several heart-stopping moments. Its real-time nature provides the viewer (and the main character) no escape from the events as they are happening. There's no ""whoa that bit was scary, let's cut to something else for a minute to get a breather.""

The twist at the end made me want to rewatch the entire movie right away. Another reviewer made a comparison to The Sixth Sense, and while the twist is not the same, you do get a similar new ""lens"" to rewatch Silent House through after your first time.

I'd quickly recommend Silent House to anyone who's looking for a good suspense/thriller film with very high rewatchability potential.",1349827200,2,2064,4.965217391304348

5094438,4,B007L6VP8W,"People either LOVE this film or HATE this film. The premise of the film starts off as one thing--a daughter (Elizabeth Olsen) and her father, as well as her Uncle are in a large creepy house trying to fix it up to sell. Their Uncle leaves to run into town, and the daughter hears a weird noise upstairs. Her father goes to check it out, and then BOOM--a great amount of terror ensues which some will find appealing, and others may not. Let me help break it down for you,

You will like this film if:

You like technical wizardry and artistic style that incorporate dark spaces, low light levels, and a general feeling of claustrophobia and fear. If you don't mind films that take place in constrained spaces, then you will like this film. Films like the superb if also somewhat cliche ""Panic Room"" with Jodie Foster come to mind.  Silent House is shot to look like one long sequence of events in real time, which is done quite well. Fans of Alfred Hitchcock's film ""Rope"" did a similar feat. This film transforms into something quite different than what it starts out as about 75% of the way through. So if you love plot twists, or don't mind things taking on a different narrative form then this won't bother you. Think of plots twists akin to the ones in ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"". You will also like this film if you like looking for clues. Pay close attention to the different details that are peppered through the film--you will be rewarded at the end if you do. Things are not as they seem!

You will NOT like this film if:

This film can be very confusing at times. Continuity in terms of the plot is difficult to surmise until the END of the film when things finally come crashing together. So you may feel like the film is having an identity crisis --is it a panic/torture type flick? Is it a ghost film? Is it one about revenge? Mental illness? Or just about a bunch of hooligans trying to prevent a house from being sold? If you like a plot that is steady and that does not morph constantly, and if you don't like ""guessing"", then this film will probably drive you crazy. Also, if you didn't like the film ""The Blair Witch"" then you probably won't like this. It's a lot of running around in dark spaces. Except instead of three college students lost in the woods running around--the woman is trapped in a strange house running around in the dark.

There is no shame in liking what you like. That being said, I hope this review will help you decide if you would like to watch this film or not. It's actually a remake of an independent film that was shot in Uruguay, allegedly based on ""true"" events. Many people feel that the original was superior. The fact remains that honestly--there is not ""original"" story. It's more about the way that the story is told.

I personally think this film has many merits, but I am very aware that my own personal opinion is influenced by my own tastes. Many of my friends disliked the film, while many of them loved it. So see for yourself! I'd love to know what other people thought! Feel free to comment in response to this review!",1348185600,4,3086,4.422535211267606
5094439,2,B007L6VP8W,"The one shot apparently, uncut shot, or one take, or whatever is clever, and very well done, in fact we need more Chris Kentis and Laura Lau's in this world, to push different envelopes of celluloid, and I understand that camcorder grainy looking guerrilla type film making that made Blair Witch so brilliant, is token here. I am sure there will certainly be a large chunk of the audience that watched it looking to get terrified, who are probably unaware, on any conscious plain, of the single-shot technique while watching and think absolutely nothing of it after, and if that the directors goal, they achieved it. But that is the only credit I can give them, because save that, its a total fiasco. I really thought I was watching a take, or a rehearsal, not because of that style of film making, but because the acting was so pushed and horrendous. The father was just horrid, what a wrong choice for career moves for that dude. Wooden, fake, horrible; you could walk away from the screen in the first fifteen minutes, and think you were hearing a bunch of NY academy of film kids rehearsing on a 19th street corner.

If not then make sure the boards are so shut, and SHOWN that way, that the viewer would say, 'well good luck sweetheart trying to pry those open from the inside, did you see all those nails on the outside of the house'  re  gard less....

ok SPOILER ALERT::::

.
.
so shes a mess from the mold (or so the camera lends us to believe twice) and the toxins getting to her head and well yeah she its retaliation for being abused by her father and her uncle as a kid, and this was plotted revenge.....so there was no friend from the past and no zombie looking creature carrying bodies, it was her all along....intriguing....simple, not really a twist so to speak, but still kinda not original.....

So yeah lets run back and forth in a house with three levels, and hope the person in there isn't on one of the floors, its not a maze, its a small cape cod looking home, honestly where is the intruder going to hide.....I can understand if it was a huge Mansion on long island but really......then again the nice long shot as she leave the house, shows it to be a bit more massive then lead to believe originally.

honestly, the lowest common denominator of film making, I'd even place it under The Strangers, and that was so bad, it was good.

but two stars for the one long shot....",1348185600,,2697,4.467479674796748

5094446,4,B007L6VP8W,"This is a hard movie to review without putting spoilers in here but I'll try.
The movie only did so-so with the critics but the acting was praised so I figured...why not, I've seen so many horror films that were so bad I had to shut them off.
This one was pretty good but VERY difficult.
Not difficult in the normal sense but difficult in the ""Huh???"" sense.
Here's the set up.
A young woman, her dad and her uncle go to the families house in the woods.
Typical spooky old house that's in horrible shape and has been vandalized repeatedly over the years.
They're trying to fix it up to sell it.
Sure enough a gang of vandals show up and start to terrorize the family.
Here is the difficult part of the film and why I had a somewhat hard time making it to the end.
The woman in the film simply does EVERY single cliche to be found in horror films.
From hiding under the bed, to hiding under the pool table, knowing full well the bad guys knew she was under there. The whole time with a perpetually frozen scream on her face.
Honestly?
By the mid mark of the film I wanted to run up and smack her.
FIGHT BACK LADY!!!
Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th. all had strong female characters that fought back.
However...a little past the mid mark of the film the story reveals itself to be something else alltogether.
And this is where it's hard not to spoil.
I think they meant it as an act III twist but it was rather obvious what was really going on.
It was still a good twist and was much better than the usual ""home invasion"" type movie.
Everything she was doing from hiding under the bed and every other ridiculous thing she did suddenly made sense.
Not really a horror movie but a psychological drama that is very demanding of your attention.
You'll roll your eyes frequently but the payoff is at the end.
To summarize...
Excellent direction.
Amazing acting.
A good but not great story that manages to avoid the majority of horrors short comings.

It's a shame really because I truly was enjoying the movie up to that point. I'm still giving the movie 3 stars because I thought Elizabeth Olsen did a great job, and the rest of the performances weren't anything terrible either. A friend of mine came up with a great way to describe this movie...It was like watching Ghostbusters (no real resemblance..just using it as in reference to a good movie that I enjoyed) and then at the end finding out it was all just an amusement park ride.

""Silent House"" is a prime example of a movie that might give you such an oddly contradictory push/pull reaction.

It is unrelieved eeriness, hauntingly photographed. It has the look of a classic ""things that go bump in the old dark house"" genre.  However, in the commentary included on this DVD, the director almost dismisses the scary aspects of this film, wanting viewers to concentrate instead on certain underlying psychological themes. Well, for me, the psychological themes have an unconvincing resolution. Any attempt to justify this film by representing it as being more than just a fright-fest is a stretch.

So if you want to be scared and can bear the chills - this is the movie for you. If you do in fact find deeper psychological truths that you can relate to here, consider it an unexpected bonus.",1346112000,,979,4.641618497109826

After Sarah's uncle leaves for a bit, Sarah and her dad get attacked and thus the real meat of the film begins as Sarah tries to survivea against this unknown threat. Outside of its presentation its not much different than most horror movies of recent years but at least its not always boring. It is also far, far, far better than ""Open Water"" ever could've hope to have been.

However the movie isn't without its flaws, the continous shots both help and hurt it, help cause it is neat to see but hurts cause it feels kinda amateurish after a while.

I wasn't expecting much because it didn't get strong ratings, but within 20 minutes of starting the film, I was pleasantly surprised by it's engrossing nature.  Maybe many reviewers didn't like it because it doesn't have expensive digital effects and lots of explosions.  Don't get me wrong, I love those movies too, and I usually only watch the movies without a huge budget when I run out of blockbuster movies.

But this movie was so well done.  The story is interesting, though not completely original.  The cinematography was expertly done, following her around as she explored thumps and clunks, and later as she tried to find a way out of the house.  The whole thing is shot as though we are standing right next to her, experiencing the frights as they come right along with her.  The only things that happen in this movie are things that she sees or hears.  But it's not done in an annoying ""Blair Witch"" way.  And whoever did the lighting on this movie was a genius!

And that leads me to Elizabeth Olsen.  She was amazing!  I can't believe this is the first time I've seen her act, because she seemed so natural it's like she's been doing it her whole life.  There were many times she was alone, and the movie went for minutes without much dialogue.  But her demeanor and prowess in front of the camera drew me in like no other new actress has since Ellen Page in ""Hard Candy.""

Silent House, supposedly is based on a real incident that took place in a village in Uruguay in the 1940s. That explains why it's a remake of the 2010 Uruguayan film La casa muda (The Silent House).
Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) is staying in a beat-up Victorian house with her father, John (Adam Trese) and her uncle, Peter (Eric Sheffer Stevens). Their plan is to renovate the house and then put it on the market. The problems is local kids and vagrants have vandalized the house. So they have boarded up all the windows, made the doors where they are locked from the inside and pad locked every other possible entry point. There's no power, no phones so the three of them find their way around with battery-operated lanterns and flashlights. So Silent House  is quite effective with creating atmosphere, that creaks and with sheets covering most of the furniture. The uncle leaves.
The film makers have thrown in another interesting gimmick, they'd filmed paranoid Sarah moving around through this environment in one continuous take.
Sarah starts hearing noises. Her father reassures her that it's probably just rats and insists she ""concentrate on packing.""
While filling garbage sacks she hears a loud thump.
Sarah reluctantly investigates when her father won't answer her calls. She find him unconscious, and bleeding from the head. She also discovers she is not alone.
She tries to escape, realizes she can't get out of the house so takes refuge in the shadows.
Silent House is a decent suspense thriller, and the real time filming keeps it interesting. As with most horror films it falls apart a bit in the end.",1343779200,,1670,4.897526501766785

Sarah sounds like she is laughing, when she is supposed to be sobbing and/or hysterical, and there is absolutely 0 plot development at all.  Then, the movie just ends, and leaves you saying ""WTF?"".  The Silent part of the title came from the audience's reaction in the theater when the movie was over.

Although the acting is pretty good, at times it is a little flimsy. Not because the actors are lacking, as much as poor directing in some scenes. The story is strange, and somewhat idiotic specially towards the end. Half of the plot has no explanation ever throughout the film, and the movie ends and you still remain with a lot of unanswered questions. It's not that this movie could have part II either. This is not that type of movie either.

It gave me the impression that Silent House lost a reel or two at the editing room, and that they just used the remaining filmed reels. Again, a lot of the plot parts seem to be missing, to achieve the category of a completed film. I know Indy films are usually peculiar, but this one goes further by leaving you with too many questions.

I liked a lot of the camera shallow depth of field used here. Probably 90% of the film is about capturing the face of actress Olsen, and because of the shallow depth of field used, you can barely distinguish anything else around her. On top of that, the film takes place in a very dark interior. Takes filmed outside is has been reduced to a minimum. This add a lot of the eeriness to the film.

Bottom line: you will end up with that feeling that you have not seen the movie completely, yet.",1343520000,,1304,4.310204081632653
5094627,2,B007L6VP8W,"I have long been a fan of horror movies, but my preferences have changed with the passage of time.  To state my biases clearly, I enjoy a good ghost story or  a ""creature feature"", but I dislike horror movies about psychotic maniacs: you don't need any movies to experience these, just tune into the news. It is, of course, a personal preference but I particularly dislike movies that play games with what is reality in the context of the story.  I always feel as if I've been tricked.  I have no complaints about the acting or cinematography in ""Silent House"" , and the actors and staff deserve credit for a performance well done. I just wanted to see a good ghost story not movie about a mentally ill person.  Obviously, many people have different preferences and tastes, which I certainly respect, and really enjoy this subtype.

5094630,4,B007L6VP8W,"I am always cautiously optimistic when it comes to horror film remakes because they're often an attempt to ""modernize"" the original and throw in some blood and boobies that the original may have lacked. It comes off as a cheap and sleazy attempt to cash in on the success of the original and that's just not okay. Having seen the original Uruguayan film La Casa Mudre when it was released, I was really excited to see what they would make of it in this new version starring the impressive Elizabeth Olsen. My breakdown goes a little something like this:

The Original Film:
-Shot in one take which was its success and its downfall due to lighting and camera issues.
-The film was extraordinarily dark and even though I realize that was meant to add suspense, there could have been a bit more light.
-The darkness of the original film made it very challenging to read the subtitles without missing any big scare moments.
-The plot was painfully vague and although the movie definitely evoked a spooky feeling, it lacked a significant plot line.
-All in all, it was the concept of how the film was produced that made La Casa Mudre memorable, and not much else.

The Remake:
-Still maintained the ""dark"" element, adding just enough light to make it a little less frustrating for the viewer but still just as creepy. I also loved how it was daytime outside through almost the entire course of the movie. Scary to think that such terrifying things could be happening inside while it was still light outside.
-Obviously, being in English helped to keep me engaged in what I was seeing and thus a lot more tense and frightened in those big moments.
-The plot was much more developed and interesting to follow, with an ending that (while not 100% original) was still fresh enough to be disturbing albeit pretty predictable.

No spoilers here. I'd say its definitely worth a watch.

P.S. Nice to know there's an Olsen out there whose acting roles don't involve pre-teen hijinx and slapstick comedy. I hope she sticks around. She was very believable and did a really incredible job.

P.P.S. This film, unlike the original, was actually broken up into 12 minute takes as confirmed by Olsen and the directors. Still pretty impressive if you ask me, 12 minutes is a pretty long time, especially in a fairly fast-paced movie like this one.",1343433600,,2325,4.702702702702703

1. She seemed to get freaked out/scared WAY to easily.  I was wondering why she would react so terrified to such simple stuff.  She knew her dad and uncle were there, so hearing sounds isn't really abnormal.

2. They advertised this as in real-time style, but by the end of the movie, you realize that was entirely pointless (SPOILER: there is a twist that makes the real-time aspect completely bogus since what we've been watching isn't what was going on.  So what we saw wasn't even the correct unfolding of events).

I feel the movie was very cliche with an ending that's been beaten to death.  Some may find this scary, but I was just scratching my head wondering why she was so freaked out so quickly.  And wondering when I would finally get a good scare. Never happened.",1343088000,,839,4.577181208053691

5094667,1,B007L6VP8W,"The previews made this move look so scary.  The only cool part is that it is all in real time.  No cuts or anything.  There were also maybe 2-3 parts that made you jump overall.

First of all this movie was extremely bad.  You think the plot of the movie is one thing until the stupid ending and both had nothing to do with each other.  Seemed like they were trying to try huge twists in the movie like The 6th Sense but failed badly.

They make you think these people are breaking into the house which has no electricity so it is always dark inside and boarded up.  So she hears noises at times and actually seeing people and so you think it is going to get good.  But it doesn't last long and then she sees an old friend who came by who is weird.

Then her dad and uncle get in a fight and it is just her and her dad for a bit.  More little noises and then the people trying to find her again which they made short and not suspenseful imo.

So that goes on for a little bit then she goes up to the attic or just upstairs or something and start remembering things and the rest would spoil the movie but you find out the full story and then look back and think how stupid and how the main plot had nothing to do with anything.

Maybe wait for it to come on TMC or HBO or something.  HUGE let down overall.

The only other good stuff about the movie was Elizabeth Olsen as she did look hot in it imo again.  The camera kept showing her upper body too which was funny.",1342656000,2,1466,3.986254295532646
5094668,5,B007L6VP8W,"happened to catch the original Uruguayan Silent House just by chance flipping through channels on late night TV. I was captivated. I'm a complete Horror freak, and the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I LOVED the continuous camera sweep (ala Russian Ark), and the acting was superb. I don't scare easily, and I rarely jump at the typical scares in horror flicks, but this movie got the best of me a few times. After watching it, I immediately logged on to Amazon to order the original Uruguayan movie.

Sure as anything, I soon found out that there was a US remake coming out. As far as I'm concerned, there is very little talent in Hollywood, and it's a common trend to just remake popular movies to cash in on their success. I was very skeptical, but because I loved the original, I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed.

Elizabeth Olsen is not of the same strain of her twin sisters who have ridden the wave of their childhood fame for being cute babies. She actually acts in Silent House, and very well. Even though I had seen the original, and I knew what to expect, I still jumped...several times.

Excellent acting, a great creepy story, and wonderful camera work. Naturally the pompous Hollywood director thought he could improve on the original version by slightly changing the storyline (the Uruguayan version was fine the way it was), but even with the changes, the movie was excellent. From the acting, the creepy basement scene, to the music used to set the mood...excellent remake of an already great movie.",1342569600,2,1560,4.60431654676259

5094675,1,B007L6VP8W,"Silent House is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, and I saw The Devil Inside in theaters. I have a particularly strong dislike of the movie because critics seem so willing to forgive its awfulness on account of the gimmicky appearance of doing the movie in one take and the fact that they like Elizabeth Olsen.

Many critics are also looking to the ending of the movie to explain why people didn't like it (the movie got a CinemaScore rating of ""F"" from audiences). The ending does suck, but the movie was bad long before things ever got there. I'll break it down piece by piece:

1) Over-the-top reactions. Elizabeth Olsen may be a fine actress. I didn't see the movie that critics started loving her in. But very early in the movie, even before it's clear to the audience that there's really anyone in the house with her, the main character is going into 100% freak-out mode. It destroys any later tension, because she has nowhere to go.

2) Unrealistic reactions. Several times, something happens where whoever is in the house with the girl does something to make it obvious that they know she's there. She runs away, looking for a door or a window to open, can't find one, and then she goes back into slow sneak around the house mode instead of trying to find a place to hide or something. The problem here isn't the typical idiotic horror film reaction where someone does something unintelligent. The problem is that it glaringly makes you say, ""Wait, I thought there was someone chasing her. Why is she suddenly being calm again? And, for that matter, the house isn't that big. Why haven't they caught her already?"" You could explain this, but not on your first viewing, and on that first viewing it takes you way out of the movie and makes you very aware that you are watching one.

3) Bad camera work. The camera is annoyingly shaky throughout, the worst example being a scene where she does run out of the house, which is so shaky it could give you motion sickness. And they keep the camera focused on Elizabeth Olsen's shoulder or cleavage or extremely close to her face throughout, and when it's not then the rooms are so dark you can't see anything. The result is that most of the time you can't tell what's going on. There is something to be said for leaving something to the audience's imagination, but it just doesn't work here, largely because she freaks out so much early on when all that happened was some books fell or something.

4) Pointless characters. There is a character in the movie that really serves no purpose whatsoever, unless you start doing silly explaining-the-inconsistencies gymnastics to try to contrive some reason why that character needed to be there, but really there isn't one.

5) Predictability. The ending did stink, and it was pretty obvious pretty early on what the twist was going to be. There were also very few genuine scares, because the camera would do things like linger on a rear-view mirror with no one there, then go close up on the back of the girl's neck, and then pan back to the mirror. And then - big surprise - there's someone there. Only the most green of horror movie viewers wouldn't see that coming ten miles away.

6) Glaring inconsistencies. The movie makes a point of showing that unlocking the front door is a pain because it requires using a key that is hanging on a hook near the door. It takes Elizabeth Olsen's character some time to lock this door when she goes in the house. Then another character promptly exits the house by opening and closing the door off-screen in about 2 seconds.

Any of those points on its own probably wouldn't make for a terrible movie. But taken together, they make for a complete waste of time. Pass on this. You'll be better off.",1338508800,5,3752,4.564635958395245
5094676,5,B007L6VP8W,"I saw this movie last night on pay per view in my hotel and I only watched it based on the merits of young Elizabeth Olsen, after being very impressed by her fine performance in ""Martha, Marcy, May, Marlene"". Quite frankly I didn't know what to expect and my expectations were not that high. I've seen lots of indie horror movies that try real hard but end up falling short on the chills, often resorting to haggard, old plot devices to try and scare the audience. I am not easily scared and the vast majority of horror movies coming out today, fail, time and time again to scare me to any great extent.

Such was NOT the case with ""Silent House"". This movie pulls you in from the opening frames with Elizabeth Olsen sitting on a rock by the ocean. Miss Olsen is classically beautiful and is proving herself to be a very talented actor. As she is drawn into the big, dark, sinister house, there is an overwhelming feeling of dread that permeates this atmospheric little chiller and the viewer is soon gripped as Miss Olsen's character is terrorized by bumps in the night, fleeting shadows, ghostly images and the knowledge that after her father is attacked and rendered unconscious by an unseen assailant, she is not alone in the big lonely house, then the spine-tingling suspense gets kicked up several notches to full out terror. But this is just the beginning. As the tale unfolds we are served up a very troubling plot twist that leaves the viewer stunned.

Elizabeth Olsen, the younger, as yet less famous, but (in my opinion), more talented sister of twin child stars Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen is a rising star and I hope to see her more in the future. She has all the potential to become a Hollywood A-lister as you will see when you watch ""Silent House.""",1338422400,49,1763,4.558359621451104
