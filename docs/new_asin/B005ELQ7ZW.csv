4666706,5,B005ELQ7ZW,This is the funniest program I have seen in ages. Great British humour.. Be prepared to laugh out loud. An Idiot abroad 1 is also just as funny.  I have now seen both DVD's and rate them equally.,1350691200,2,195,4.131578947368421
4666707,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Loved every single minute of Karl whinging and moaning as he travels the world once again. Showing what no other travel show dares to reveal, the real in's and out's. How I long for a third season, but alas I know it's only a dream!",1343692800,2,232,4.177777777777778
4666708,5,B005ELQ7ZW,This series is the funniest thing I have ever seen!!! You will laugh so hard you won't be able to catch your breath! This is a must have. You will enjoy it over and over again...I keep renting from amazon because they didn't release it in U.S yet...,1339804800,12,249,4.208333333333333
4666709,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Season 2 is even better than the first.  I have to keep pausing it because I'm laughing so hard.  I love Karl and I didn't even know who he was until I watched this show recently.  I have never listened to the podcast even though I like Ricky.  I need more of Karl now though!!,1339286400,6,277,3.981818181818182
4666710,5,B005ELQ7ZW,THIS SERIES IS GREAT. KARL IS JUST AN ORDINARY GUY THROWN IN TO ANOTHER GUYS BUCKET LIST NOT HIS OWN.THERE IS A TWIST OF COURSE AND IT IS ALWAYS A CHALLANGE. IT REMINDS ME OF THE OLD SAYING BE CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU WISH FOR YOU JUST MIGHT GET IT !! THE SITUATIONS HE FINDS HIMSELF IN ARE HYSTERICAL AND IT AMAZES ME HOW KARL ALWAYS SEEMS TO RELATE TO ANY CULTURE AND OF COURSE THERE IS ALWAYS A CALL FROM RICKY OR STEVE TO ADD AN EXTRA TWIST TO THE SITUATION .I LOVE IT ALSO BECAUSE IT TAKES YOU TO PLACES AND CUST0MS I WOULD NEVER SEE ANY WHERE ELSE.ILOVE THIS SERIES AND KARL IS MY NEW HERO AN UNIQUE AND FUNNY SHOW!,1337212800,4,616,3.975806451612903
4666711,4,B005ELQ7ZW,I love this show. Karl is a man that will just say what ever is on his mind and his mind works is weird ways. This show always makes me laugh.,1333152000,2,142,3.6129032258064515
4666712,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"This is a hilarious docucomedy...Karl is so gullable, and Ricky really sticks him into the most outrageous situations...watch this region 2 on your laptop...the adjustment needed will pop up on the screen automatically...true,it doesn't work on dvd players in US...Enjoy!",1327622400,,271,5.8
4666713,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"If you've never seen, or listened to, Karl Pilkington along with Ricky and Steve, you are missing out on one of the most hilarious and, well...insightful human brains in the world.  It's impossible for me to watch this without laughing so hard that I have to pause to catch my breath.  Yes, it's Region 2 (UK) and won't play on US players, but there are good multi-region players out there for those of us in the US desperate for excellent shows like this, Being Human, Misfits, etc.",1325980800,6,483,4.540229885057471
4666714,1,B005ELQ7ZW,This DVD will not work in the United States.  It is a Region 2 DVD and should not be sold to customers in the U.S.,1325894400,10,114,3.56
4666745,4,B005ELQ7ZW,"More of the same from season 1. Some of the situations in season 2 I didn't find as funny as in season 1. But to see Carl who really doesn't want to venture beyond his safety zone, decide to wing walk instead of dance in a Gay club.... well..... That's worth the price of admission in itself. Really, the only complaint I have about the series is... Where is season 3 an 4... Come-on, your loving fans await.",1438732800,,408,4.243589743589744
4666746,5,B005ELQ7ZW,We love it!  So funny!,1437523200,,22,3.4

4666770,1,B005ELQ7ZW,Won't play.  U.S.,1412985600,,17,4.666666666666667
4666771,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"If you're a fan of Ricky Gervais's other series like the ORIGINAL Brit version of ""The Office"", and the even better ""Extras"", you will love this!  It's like watching a Michael Palin travelogue, except with Gervais' eternally-whinging and moaning ""orange-headed mank"" sidekick, Karl Pilkington very reluctantly doing the traveling to exotic places instead!  Very funny stuff!",1412380800,,374,5.660714285714286
4666772,5,B005ELQ7ZW,love it!!!,1412121600,,10,4.5
4666773,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Quite simply, Karl rules!",1409011200,,25,5.5
4666774,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Season 2 is almost as good as the first season.  I love them both.  Didn't buy Season 3, as I didn't think I would watch it as often as the first 2.",1406073600,,148,3.59375
4666775,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Very Very funny. My wife and I love the series and can kill a weekend just watching.,1405036800,,84,4.0
4666776,4,B005ELQ7ZW,But that is why this show is so great. But then again I might hate flying too if it involved standing on the wing.,1400371200,,114,3.7916666666666665
4666787,3,B005ELQ7ZW,"I love these guys and enjoyed the first series quite a bit, but I'm at an age where my hearing is going South.  Sometimes I need to put on subtitles.  There is, of course, some Brit accents here, but sadly the blu-ray has no subtitles.  It was bad enough that I couldn't watch these.",1397001600,,283,4.203703703703703
4666788,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Been a fan of Karl Pilkington for a while now. This season of Idiot Abroad was so hilarious that I can keep watching it over and over. I love how Karl is always so miserable in such gorgeous places...it definitely makes for some great TV!,1395878400,,238,4.311111111111111
4666789,5,B005ELQ7ZW,It's really funny but it's on net flicks now so don't spend the money. I've seen all seasons and enjoyed them.,1395187200,,110,4.285714285714286
4666790,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Having watched this series at home in the UK I decided to buy it for my cousin's son for his Xmas gift as he enjoys British humour. Karl is sent off to various locations around the world by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Marchant and they organise for him to do some unusual things at each stop. He is a typical northern lad and he's always got a pessimistic view of everything. The things he gets up yo our often hilarious. Love this series and so did my cousin's son!,1393718400,,464,4.224719101123595
4666791,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Ricky is brilliant. The premise of this show, his choice of character, Karl, and his clever method of persuasion is positively evil. Ricky and Steve will do absolutely ANYTHING for a good laugh...and this show proves it. Best reality TV has to offer. You could never write this script. Karls eyes are opened, as well as yours, when you see things you have NEVER seen before as you are stunned to learn about the world along with him.",1392595200,,433,4.564102564102564
4666792,5,B005ELQ7ZW,I love it the way karl sees the world and how he complains is hilarious a awesome show for anybody,1392508800,,98,3.95
4666793,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Laugh out load funny. Not politically correct, but funny. We watched one episode and got hooked. Give it a try!",1389484800,,111,4.6
4666794,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"I laughed until I cried!! Do not miss seeing this. This entire series is worth watching. Karl Pilkington is pure genius, and in my opinion, it just doesn't get any better than this.",1388188800,,181,4.515151515151516
4666795,2,B005ELQ7ZW,"Let me start off by saying I adored the first season of this show.  The second season....not so much.  Somehow this season seems more rehearsed and forced than the previous season.  Karl seems much to self-aware this time around and although it is still enjoyable, it wasn't as enjoyable as the first time around and the concept seems tired.",1384387200,,341,4.745762711864407
4666796,4,B005ELQ7ZW,"The rotted fish ingestion is laugh inducing and the best part of an otherwise surprisingly boring episode until you remember all the times ""rotted fish"" was mentioned as the common food offered to Allied prisoners of Japanese POW camps in Southeast Asia.  Given Japan's modernity and wealth, it should be one of the best places for the host to visit but he didn't seem to find fun things to do.  He visited a cat cafe that looked claustrophobic and cheap, did some exercises with workers, visited a cheap looking dollar store, got beaten by a monk with a bamboo pole sitting in some kind of hut so it looked like he was some kind of POW in the Phillipines and opined after climbing Mount Fuji, ""Japan's done.""",1383523200,,709,4.574803149606299
4666817,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Most people would be thrilled to experience what Karl has done; travel to different lands, witness a variety of cultures and fortunately, you can sit back and see what happens to Karl, with Ricky and Stephen as  guides. The accomodations, food, and detours Mr. P endures are fun to watch because of his reluctant, child-like, grumpiness. You are hoping that Karl will find some ounce of pleasure in his adventures, but as you watch, you have to laugh at his 'glass is half-empty' outlook every where he goes! Some of his reactions are truly hilarious. You will not be bored watching!",1382227200,,583,4.772277227722772
4666818,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Season two was as good if not better than season 1.  The DVD is easy to use and has some great added scenes that were not part of the season episodes.  Any fan of an Idiot Abroad will not be disappointed with the 2nd season DVD.,1381881600,,228,3.9347826086956523
4666819,4,B005ELQ7ZW,Not as consistently uproarious as Season 1 only because Karl is expecting things to become strange or annoying. His commentary is still what makes the show addicting.,1380672000,,166,5.185185185185185
4666820,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Karl Pilkington is great, his humor lies in authentic reaction to things we are expected to go 'wow' at.
They have the formula now but seeing Karl handle Japan was the bet.
Don't miss it, hilarious!",1378512000,,198,4.527777777777778
4666821,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"I love Karl! He has a unique and hilarious way of describing his travels. Additionally, you can learn some things about unique places in the world as a bonus.",1376784000,,158,4.482758620689655
4666822,5,B005ELQ7ZW,this has got to be the best laugh i have had in years well done to karl i don't know how he keeps such a straight face throughout the video,1375142400,,139,3.6666666666666665
4666823,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"The show is funny, original, and great adventure. I've watched every episode of season 1, 2, and 3 and will watch them again.",1371513600,,125,4.478260869565218
4666824,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"This show is absolutely brilliant. It's the most entertaining ""travel show"" I've ever seen. You can learn about new places with that fabulous humor that only Karl, Ricky and Steven can bring.",1369785600,,191,5.0
4666825,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"I LOVE the sense of humor... I know no reality show is true ""reality"", but I think it would be hard to make 95% of that stuff up.",1366243200,,129,3.642857142857143
4666826,5,B005ELQ7ZW,2nd Season of An Idiot Abroad featuring Karl Pilkington is really funny.  Pilkington brings his wit and  wisdom to another series of travels.  This is as enjoyable as the 1st series.,1365897600,,182,4.806451612903226
4666837,4,B005ELQ7ZW,thought it was pretty funny. the show was very original. I would watch more of these episods. I would like to see a lower cost for each episod.,1365033600,,143,4.142857142857143
4666838,5,B005ELQ7ZW,The shows are hillarious. Very very funny. Carl gets in so many predicaments that its hard to think they are not staged. If they are - he has to be one of the best actors ever. Highly recommended.,1364515200,,196,4.184210526315789
4666839,5,B005ELQ7ZW,I love the Rickey Gervais show where I was introduced to Karl Pilkington and these adventures that he gets sent on are priceless,1364083200,,128,4.608695652173913
4666840,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Idiot Abroad (The first in the series) was a fantastic video - and, what an opportunity to see locations around the world that the incidental tourist would never find highlighted in a guidebook or hear about from a travel agent. It only gets better: Karl stars in all of the episodes, and it's impossible not to be seduced by his wit, candor, profundity and unique, circular charms! Ricky and Steve keep him hopping - and regulate his moods rather well when they put their minds to it. The three men are so interesting, they could sit and chat for hours, record their ramblings, and most likely have another hit. Idiot Abroad Season2 is a video to keep for those times when you desperately need an uplift, a situational cheerleader, a major distraction. It's something to have and to hold, and to cherish until your sides actually do split.",1363737600,,840,4.6824324324324325
4666841,4,B005ELQ7ZW,"Average guy with odd sense of humor and above average intelligence goes abroad, and views the world with his newly met inhabitants.  He meets his new surroundings with chatty banter and imprecise pessimism.  Hes slightly negative probably do to his stressful agenda and non kush travels.

Seasons 2 is just as good",1363737600,,314,5.0
4666842,1,B005ELQ7ZW,This product doesn't work on american dvd players :[ i wish they would label the foreign dads on here so i wouldn't buy them and return them constanty.,1363564800,,151,4.428571428571429
4666843,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Loved it!  Karl is a great sport! Great follow up to season 1.  Cant wait for the next season! Yay!,1363392000,,99,3.9
4666844,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"This show is friggen hilarious. Give it a try, I am sure you will agree. Five more words are required.",1363132800,,102,4.15
4666845,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"After almost wearing out my Season 1 of An Idiot Abroad, I was very excited when they finally made Season 2 available for Region 1 (US & Canada).  I can't say it enough, this Season is worth every penny.  Every episode Karl makes me laugh while he's on his Bucket List trips.  Just like season 1, Karl's views on the places he visits, people he meets, and events he participates in amazes me.

As far as I see it, there's no Cons to purchasing this series.

If you haven't seen Season 1, you should watch that first to get to know Karl Pilkington and the way he thinks before watching Season 2.",1362355200,,594,4.267857142857143
4666846,5,B005ELQ7ZW,What can I say?...lol lol lol....You won't be disappointed.  Hubby and i just laugh and laugh and laugh.  Carl is too hilarious and Ricky just continues to poke at him.,1362268800,,168,4.566666666666666
4666847,1,B005ELQ7ZW,Although I have had the issue sorted here in New Zealand - I was disappointed to receive a dvd that was not suitable to be played in New Zealand.  I wouldn't have thought you would have dispatched a dvd that was only able to played in USA/Canada when my address was New Zealand.,1362268800,,278,4.245283018867925
4666848,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Hands down my favorite season of An Idiot Abroad. Karl is unbelievable here and Ricky and Steve's sideline antics are really hilarious. You'll definitely gain a new perspective on world culture.,1361923200,,194,5.290322580645161
4666849,5,B005ELQ7ZW,I love every single episode. I have watched them multiple times and each time I laugh. Get this if you want to cheer yourself up or just need a good laugh!,1361923200,,155,4.032258064516129
4666850,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"I just can't believe that there is a season two after season one's ending. I am so happy he came back to do this one. My mom and I laughed so hard at him and his antics and comments. It was wonerfully funny, and is definately worth owning. I did love season one more, but I still love this so much that I quote it frequently or now have inside jokes with my mom about some of Karl's thoughts. I would absolutely hate to spoil it, but I will say if you love season one, this is a must. The extras in this season are also a good reason to get the dvds.",1361577600,,550,3.8761061946902653
4666851,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Best travel show ever. I don't like to see what everyone else does and this show is off the tourist map!,1361404800,,104,4.0
4666852,4,B005ELQ7ZW,A fun show for anyone who wants a new perspective on world travel. Great locations and great off the norm stops along with a good bit of British humor. Would have got 5 stars except for the creepy scenes with brief nudity.,1361318400,,222,4.309523809523809
4666853,5,B005ELQ7ZW,I've loved Karl Pilkington since first hearing him on the Ricky Gervais show years ago. The Idiot Abroad series is pure genius. Watching Karl's reactions provides hours of laughter. The only downside is that it's not available on Blu Ray.,1360886400,,238,4.975
4666854,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"Didn't quite capture the novelty of the first season, but still a lot of fun.  Much more interesting way to see some great sights than more dry travelogues.",1360022400,,156,4.571428571428571
4666855,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"well finally they are getting this out in US format so we can enjoy. the bucket list season 2 is just as good as season one maybe better. this round through Karl is open to having a little more fun with his task and even does a stunt in the final episode very few people would have the stomache for. lots of fun in this season great humor more of the same style as season one. would love to see more adventures of karl - and ""his pet snake"" ricky -(watch the trio chat at the end of the special features for some hilarious dialog)",1358899200,,530,4.057142857142857
4666856,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"these guys are awesome. Karl is great. Well watch it again definitely.  Ricky and Steve r funny, but Karl brings the funny again and again",1357689600,,138,4.52
4666857,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"I enjoyed this season. The pacing was great, Karl's adventures were excellent (not just making him uncomfortable in cold) and the only thing that was slightly out of sync was when he was supposed to be in California, they used footage of him by the wigwam motel in Arizona.",1357171200,,273,4.591836734693878
4666858,2,B005ELQ7ZW,I can only assume that I purchased the wrong version since it will not play on my Blue Ray player or PS3. I read the other reviews prior to purchasing and it did not state that it was the european version.,1356652800,,205,4.024390243902439
4666859,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"I love, love love this show! It's hilarity is endless. Karl Pilkington is a diamond in the rough. A real gem. Ricky and his producing partner Steven had the best idea to send Carl around the World. The best. :D",1356220800,5,210,4.275
4666860,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"I have seen a couple of episodes on tv and only intended on renting one episode.  Well, I'm almost done with the entire first season.  Can't go 5 minutes without breaking into tears from laughter.  Karl's dryness and delivery is top notch.",1355875200,2,239,4.642857142857143
4666861,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Karl is so intertaining I can't get enough of him. I want him to have a web cam attached to him all day everyday so I can be with him on his adventure of living.,1354838400,,161,3.6285714285714286
4666862,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"this is the only show i have ever been able to watch over and over and laughed to tears each time.  i have introduced it to all my friends, it makes great entertainment at lunch and wine parties!",1353369600,5,195,4.131578947368421
4666863,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"This is the most hilarious show I have seen in a long time. Unbelievable.  Gervais is a genius setting up the modern day Aristotle, Karl.  Brilliant.",1352246400,3,149,4.6923076923076925
4666864,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Season 2 is as good as season one of Idiot Abroad.  Watching someone reluctantly do adventerous things that others would love to do is somehow a hillarious formula!,1351555200,,164,4.857142857142857
4666865,5,B005ELQ7ZW,Absolutely hilarious and worth every penny to watch over and over as many times as you like. Karl Pilkington makes this show! Must see!!!!,1351382400,3,138,4.791666666666667
4666866,4,B005ELQ7ZW,"This episode is one of the better clips of the season. It does slow a little when Karl climbs Mt. Fuji, but the sumo bit, the sushi bit... AND the hotel 'cubicle' are great!
FYI, the Amazon Prime shows have no censored cursing so don't be surprised for the occasional f-bomb from Karl.",1350864000,,285,4.39622641509434
8468596,5,B005ELQ7ZW,"For my money, not quite as funny or engrossing as the first season. Still, it's better than 99 percent of what's on TV. And there are plenty of belly laughs. But if you haven't seen any Pilkington before, I suggest you start with the first season.
