3526345,4,B001D6OKV0,"I saw this new production at the MET and it just didn't work for me. None of the acts worked (although the last act somewhat redeems the show and I thought Philip Langridge did a great job).

This is a children's opera and it was never necessary to ""adult it up""; the music already does that, it was always mature, thoughtful, respectful of the opera, never childish or dumbed down. The opera didn't need to be made edgy or raw. This is not the Hansel & Gretel everyone else and I loved and that is a shame. Isn't life already edgy and raw enough? If the 40-year old production needed to be replaced, fine, but the opera is older than that and it was always fine the way it was.

Update: I saw this again yesterday (12/29/2011) and enjoyed it much much more. I think I finally ""got it"". I did still like the old production but I'm over my former elistist attitude.",1222041600,10,864,4.294478527607362
3526346,4,B001D6OKV0,"I loved this production.  I didn't see it live but I did see it via the simulcast at a local movie theater.  You'll enjoy it.  It's imaginative and original.  It perhaps is not for ersatz opera experts but it is quite appealing to many, including those who are not usually opera fans.",1221868800,7,284,4.403846153846154
3526347,3,B001D6OKV0,"I have to say that I enjoyed this production, even though it was weird and darker than usual. I feel like I understood where they were trying to go with it, but they weren't very successful. The biggest problem that I had while watching this was the diction (mostly Christine Schafer) and the horrible new translation. I rather liked Alice Coote as Hansel. I especially like Sasha Cook! Overall, an ""ok"" production, but there are other really nice ones (the movie version with Gruberova) I also agree with the first commenter about the HD production of Il Trittico, I really hope they release that one soon.",1221782400,3,607,4.735849056603773
3526348,1,B001D6OKV0,"After attending performances at the MET for over 40 years, I can honestly say that this production is the most distasteful farce I have ever seen!  Many people will still remember the glorious Merrill/ O'Hearn production of this opera and the joy it brought to thousands of people, including children  (the Merrill/O'Hearn Met production is available on DVD....if you are lucky enough to find it).  It seems to be popular today to take a composer's creation and twist it into something totally unrecognizable from the original libretto.  No, I am not against bringing opera into the 21st Century but one has to be extremely cautious when dealing with an opera such as ""Hansel and Gretel"".  It is an opera full of dreams, fears, poverty, love, angels, fairies, witches and triumph over adversities.
Granted, the new Met production attempts to do this but it is so blatantly ugly and depressive it just doesn't work.  The opening scene brings to mind an episode from ""The Honeymooners"" (remember Alice's kitchen?).  The Dream Sequence looks like a call-back for a ""Jaba The Hut"" chorus line audition.  The final scene has absolutely no joy in it...no joy in the salvation of all the children.
The singing is less than adequate since you can't understand it.  The new English libretto is riduculous.  The production is so tedious that one just doesn't care what the Orchestra (the best in the world) sounds like.
Since I cannot give it less than 1 star, I give that ""honor"" to EMI for, at least, giving us some Met Performances.  But please, EMI, give us a DVD of the Met HD performance of ""Il Trittico""...people will buy that one.",1221696000,21,1628,4.820143884892087
3526349,3,B001D6OKV0,"I'd like to be able to say that I was absolutely enchanted by this production.  I've enjoyed modern stagings and seen updates of familiar pieces that really worked.  This one doesn't.
Richard Jones's familiar staging (it's been seen in many cities by now) has some interesting ideas, but doesn't add up to anything worth remembering.  The singers do their best and they seem to be having a good time (except for Philip Langridge who seems ill-at-ease as the Witch), but the conceits in which Jones indulges are tired by now and have little to do with Humperdinck's opera.  Alice Coote and Christine Schafer sing well although their diction is poor (not that David Poutney's very British translation is very good anyway).  Alan Held does well as the Father, but why was Rosalind Plowright brought over to do the Mother?  The Met has plenty of antiquated mezzos to wobble through this role.  In any case, it's not her fault that the director has such a dim view of her and Held's characters.  The production itself has some fascinating moments. I love the idea of setting the three acts each in a different kitchen.  The Second Act Dream Pantomime is a lot of fun with it pig-like waitors and fish butler and all of the food in the last act does make one's mouth water.  But overall one comes away from this performance wanting to take a bath to clean off the mean-spiritedness of so much of the direction. I'd like to recommend the older Met DVD with Blegen and Von Stade, but it's not available at the moment",1221609600,12,1508,4.614232209737827
3526350,5,B001D6OKV0,Gave this as a gift to my brother. Before passing it on I had to see it to. Very good for those who enjoy opera.,1356998400,,112,3.52
3526351,5,B001D6OKV0,"Despite the early bashings, which delayed me from approaching this work for some four years, I must report that this is one of those highly imaginative, real life tales.
Who said that children should be shielded from history? What's wrong if the 'witch' was gased to death by the bright kids, and Gretel slyly smears Hansel with a moustache that resembles that of Hitler? Children are not blank sheets - it is necessary to inform them of the realities in live, via the media, the music, the drama, and last but not the least, operas. If that is to keep opera going as an art form with life, that's to say! Ostriches bury their heads in sand; not human beings.
Back to the production - it is a very imaginative and beautiful production, well acted, well sung, well conducted. The cast is a fine one, and there is no need for 'big' names to make MET productions successes, really. Even so, Rosalind Plowright, Christine Schafer are not 'nobodies', for God's sake! We do not need an Anna Netrebko for Gretel, do we?
The sets are stunning, the dream banquet really looks like a dream!
The singers are wonderful singing actors/actresses. There is absolutely no miscast. The Sandman of the new mezzo sensation Sasha Cook is one of those great 'undercastings' that really proved that this production is not one of mediocre singers.
Furthermore, this is about the last appearance on stage of veteran English tenor Philip Langridge.
The entire cast is without a single weaklink, I dare say.",1356739200,,1481,4.744186046511628
3526352,5,B001D6OKV0,"Every time an opera is produced outside of a ""traditional"" staging, a stink is raised, a fuss is thrown. a fit is hissied.  Arguments (both sensible and non) about the inappropriateness of the ""concept"" arise, as does the inevitable discussion about the death of tradition and the end of the civilized world as we know it.  Every once in a while art needs to shake us up out of a stupor.

I adore this score (and the Met's old Merrill/O'Hearn production) and found myself resisting this new one, but finally giving in during  the Prayer and Dream Pantomime.  I loathed the first image of the ""forest"" - and the fishheaded matre d'  creeped me out.  Then, I shook my head and smiled . . .  and fell under its genuinely magical spell.  By the end of the dream  pantomime, I was in tears, moved as deeply as though I'd watched silk-winged angels descending from heaven to tuck the children into 1000 thread count damask linens.  This was a vision as imagined by the children, and like a child's dream filled with whimsy, and fueled by beauty and terror and an unexpected poignancy - the very definition of sensational.

By deglazing the sugar content - albeit with a little vodka and pills - a production like this reinforces what a marvelous work of musical theatre Humperdinck's opera truly is.  Removing the veil and seeing it in a glaring and controversial light we can ascertain and focus on its glorious and intricately woven musical fabric (and yes, even with that unwieldy English text).

Maestro Jurowski was having a marvelous night with the pit band delivering a ravishing reading of the score.

Another reason this H&G worked for me was its very contrast with the O'Hearn production, making me want to revisit the opera - in an old-fashioned, ""traditional"" production, the kind I had grown to used to, but perhaps just a tad complacent with.  Sometimes, a dark, wild ride is whats needed, allowing one to come quietly back to rediscover the love still there.  I'm grateful the Met took a risk and mounted this marvelous production.",1353456000,9,2040,4.7175141242937855
3526353,1,B001D6OKV0,"I too saw this mess of a production.  I had to put my two sense in and say something.  I remember seeing this monstrosity when it aired on PBS and was horrified at what I saw.  Pigs instead of angels? Now really, this was going a bit too far.  I personally have the 1982 version of the Metropolitan opera . It was a stupendous production.  But this was a disaster... The music and performances were top notch. but the plot and characterizations with pig faces . It is apparent what the Grimm brothers were expressing in their story but this was going too far... imaginative, innovative, i think not a mess is what I call it... and that is being nice... If you want a wonderful production of the treasure ""Hansel and Gretel"" choose the 1982 production.  It is a sumptuous delight for adults and children....",1266883200,15,806,4.486301369863014

3526356,5,B001D6OKV0,"Thank Gott in Himmel we don't have another syrupy, gingerbready, little Deutsche Knoben in lederhosen running around in a fake forest. A traditional rendering of this opera may be fun for children.....50 years ago, but not today. I think this clever and beautiful take is the kind of thing that makes people (kids and adults) who ""hate opera"" realize that opera can be many many things.....and ""not liking it"" is like not liking cheese. There are a million different kinds, how can you just not like it all?

Anyway, toning down the 19th century Christianity and ""cuteness"" and replacing it with urban symbols plus the realities of vomiting and throwing flour and batter all over the place makes for a show that makes sense and is far from quaint. But the dangers here....if they were real would be totally horrifying!.... are made palpable not so much by magic as by the comedy of a kind of realism... a modern version of an old witch.... a dream of safety that is populated with the only storybook characters to be found and a sense of plenty....not of the need and want of reality.

It's great! It's for adults and children! It's not nostalgic!!! It's a fantastic production!

Don't worry! There are plenty of traditional ones to chose from too. This production is not endangering them.

5 stars for great music, great singing, great and clever staging, beautiful designs and a welcomed lack of schmaltz! I love it when the Met remembers that Opera is theatre as well as music!",1256947200,6,1480,4.747081712062257
3526357,1,B001D6OKV0,"I took my 7 year old daughter to see this at the Met. I can honestly tell you that this was the most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed, disgusting to the point that my daughter nearly became ill. I can honestly tell you that most of the people leaving the opera house at Lincoln center were also flabbergasted and nauseated by this bizarre production of a classic. If you enjoy watching people throwing up, and little children eating burnt corpses then by all means buy this, this is for you. But if you wish to see a production meant for young children, then run for your life from this one. Your youngsters will need a long chat with a psychiatrist after seeing this, as certainly does the creator of this horror show. The only redeeming quality was the superb music, other than that, forget it! By the way, a prominent critic said of this production that this wasn't ""Hansel and Gretel,"" but more like ""Hambone and Gristle!"" I totally concur! There is nothing wrong with a little tradition when something is meant for children, I can get the other stuff from B horror movies if I so choose and I don't have to pay $100.00 dollars a ticket.

3526358,5,B001D6OKV0,"I saw this production in a Los Angeles theater via the MET live broadcast. It was very very well done and my friend I dragged along (kicking and screaming) enjoyed this production even though he insists he hates all classical music. It's so nice to see this available on DVD. BTW, there are clips of this on youtube too, search for hansel and gretel 2008.",1255910400,5,355,4.476923076923077
3526359,5,B001D6OKV0,"I am one of the ""unbending traditionalists who believe going to the opera is like going to the museum"" -- (and why not a museum for opera? there are museums for all other art forms) -- and I was put off by descriptions in some of the reviews (the mother vomits!!!?), but I was completely won over by this production.  It is a superior vehicle by which to introduce children to opera -- as is the MET's ""family"" version of the Magic Flute.

Normally I object to directors who assume the audience is too attention deficit disordered to sit through an entire overture without any stage action or other distracting visuals.  In the MET Hansel und Gretel, however, we are given a marvelous visual overture to accompany the musical one: backstage scenes.  After all, the purpose of the overture is to prepare us for the scenes to come -- and for a children's opera, showing bits of the backstage preparation enhances the excitement.

Although I object strongly to Eurotrash direction, in which the director's (usually bizarre) interpretation is forced onto the libretto and score, depriving us of the multiple and subtle suggestions inherent in a great composer's conception, I found this MET interpretation very suitable for 21st century young ones.  (I was a children's librarian for twenty-seven years, and have experienced the range of books deemed suitable for children, from the saccharine to the violent.)  I confess that i missed seeing a gingerbread house, but what I did see was very much in keeping with the conception as a whole.

It would be lovely if some benefactor would provide a copy of this DVD for every school and every children's section of public libraries.  What a way to build audiences of the future.

(By the way, I bought this in spite of the reviews because I am a fan of Philip Langridge, who plays the witch.  His Peter Pears on DVD and his Schubert lieder on Hyperion CD are treasures.)",1251244800,10,1912,4.763636363636364
3526360,1,B001D6OKV0,"If you want a children's cartoon, this Hansel and Gretel is for you.  If you want opera, this is a travesty!
Anthony Rossi wrote, ""It seems to be popular today to take a composer's creation and twist it into something totally unrecognizable from the original libretto.""  Bravo, Anthony!  Unfortunately, this is what the Met is doing with almost all their new productions.
First, there is no logic in saying that this opera takes place in three kitchens.  It does not; it takes place in the cottage, in the woods, and at the gingerbread house.  Waiters in pig faces have no place in the story.  And the greatest travesty of all is the Jerry Lewis/Three Stooges approach to the witch.  She (he) is supposed to be frightening, not maniacally hysterical.  If you want a food fight, go to Animal House.
Besides a terrible production, the singing is not up to the usual Met standards.
I am delighted that I saw this first on television and did not waste my money buying the dvd.",1244505600,10,972,4.6104651162790695
3526361,2,B001D6OKV0,"I'm all for a dark take on Humperdinck's ""Hansel and Gretel.""  This is, after all, a tale with child abuse and cannibalism at its core, topics of which the Brothers Grimm had no difficulty writing, in both figurative and metaphorical terms.  In this grotesque production, however, director Richard Jones doesn't simply touch on these themes, he molests them.  Among his subtle directorial touches are the following: on hearing about the Witch, Mom vomits large chunks of food in full view of the audience; said Witch force feeds Hansel by sticking a tube and funnel down his throat; after the Witch is pushed into the oven (she's gassed, get it?), Gretel smears some chocolate on Hansel's upper lip, making him appear like Adolf Hitler.  Excuse me, this is the Met's annual holiday opera for children?  What's next, a ""Die Fledermaus"" newly interpreted by Martin McDonough?

Maybe Jones believes that, with the proliferation and popularity of violent video games, children's tastes have changed, that they crave more graphic and grotesque forms of entertainment.  Perhaps.  But do we, as adults, have to give it to them?  Can we not endeavor to preserve and/or foster a sense of magic and wonderment in our children?  Isn't there a balance between exposing them to the ""real"" world and encouraging imagination and flights of fancy?  Jones is all for the former, but is far less successful at (and seems less interested in) the latter.  Imagine a version of ""The Nutcracker"" in which Clara is raped by The Mouse King, or the ethnic dancers are ragged, starving street urchins who knife one another for sugarplums.  That's the kind of production this is.

For the most part, the roles are superbly realized and sung.  The exceptions are a dull Philip Langridge, whose performance as the Witch is as flabby as his prosthetic arms, and a dour and screechy Rosiland Plowright, decked out, for some reason, as a cross between ""AbFab's"" Patsy on a bender and Michael Caine in ""Dressed to Kill.""  Thankfully, conductor Vladimir Jurowski has an expert handle on the intricate beauty of the lush, transcendent score, even if his stage director does not.

If you want a story about nasty children with nasty parents who have nasty things happen to them, perhaps this is the ""Hansel and Gretel"" for you.  (Or maybe you should check out Ravel's ""L'Enfant et les Sortileges."")  But if you're looking for a production that charms, delights and reinforces your faith in humanity and the triumph of good over evil...look elsewhere.",1242000000,48,2514,4.971291866028708
3526362,4,B001D6OKV0,"Purists may decry the translation into English instead of the standard German, however it does not feel as if anything was lost.  The unique staging and an update into modern times makes the opera quite enjoyable.  Those who complain about the ""over the top"" staging may be forgetting that the story is supposed to be from a child's point of view.  I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the witch by a man in drag, with heavily exaggerated features.  The kitchen scene with flour flying and modern appliances screaming was quite effective.",1238457600,3,541,4.912087912087912
3526363,5,B001D6OKV0,"I saw this on PBS much earlier and just had to have it. When the dream sequence came along, I was fascinated with this production by the Met. The Hansel and Gretle characters behaved like children in their manners and antics. When the children's chorus came to life and began singing, I was crying. The witch was most delightful with the cooking scenes. My wife likes to cook and so does my 11 year old granddaughter who found the messy cooking funny.",1237161600,4,451,4.512195121951219
3526364,5,B001D6OKV0,"This production was wonderful!  Philip Langridge's witch was fantastic and he played her to the hilt.  The scene in which she is preparing food to fatten up Hansel is hilarious.  I laughed out loud watching Gretel run frantically back and forth carrying ingredients while the witch slops foods helter skelter into bowls and blenders and finally funnels it all into a tube in Hansel's mouth.  Sounds horrifying but it was pure slap stick.

Alice Coote portrayed the boy Hansel very naturally.  Christine Schaefer likewise portrayed Gretel youthfully, although I found her seeming a little too serious in the beginning.  This same quality added to the fun later on though.  Rosalind Plowright's role as the mother was nastier than the witch actually.  Alan Held was a terrific father.  Did I mention the singing?  It was first rate all around.

The Sandman, Sasha Cooke, was costumed more like a witch than the witch in this production, but the singing and the scene were terrific.  The fourteen angels were chefs providing a huge banquet.  The Dew Fairy, Lisette Oropesa, deserves special mention.  Her singing was gorgeous.

John MacFarlane's sets and costumes brought the food theme to vivid life, even the forest scene.

Vladimir Jurowski conducted masterfully.  The music of this opera is hypnotic.

If you like Hansel and Gretel, this is a must see!!!",1231718400,5,1355,5.049773755656108
3526365,5,B001D6OKV0,"I usually hate productions that ""update"" the time and place of a piece. As if we would not understand La Boheme if it's not set in the 1990's East Village.

I recently saw ""Macbeth"" set in 1950's Soviet Russia and all the machine guns, revolvers and witches dressed as nurses were distracting and useless.

The case of this Hansel and Gretel production is totally different. THere are three different sets. The second one is a forest and the third one is the witch's kitchen. Only in the first one (the kitchen at Hansel and Gretel's house) we can see that it's something like the 1930's, 1940's. But nothing gets really in between you and the ""original"" Hansel and Gretel, if such thing really exists (I mean the look of any 19th century illustration of the story).

Still the archetypal Sandman is there, the witch is there and the haunting trees are there. I think if you like movies like ""Fanny and Alexander"" and you enjoy some dark humor now and then, this is for you (and your children).

The singing and acting are great (I saw it twice live and yesterday on TV and enjoyed it every time). And, at least, you have to give this DVD credit for one thing: it is genuinely funny. And the music is beyond gorgeous.",1231113600,6,1217,4.493212669683258
3526366,5,B001D6OKV0,"I met Philip Langridge at a friend's party last year, and he was so intelligent and charming that I immediately went on line and bought tickets for HANSEL AND GRETEL. O my golly am I glad. The production was amazingly intelligent and delightful! The music was gorgeously played and sung.

I have trotted these opinions out at parties since then, and it nearly gets me into fistfights with purists. You can read in the other reviews the exact differences between the two camps. And because the purists often rule, we may not see this production again. But it exists on this DVD, and some of the production's incredible charm has been preserved.

Philip Langridge and his old witch impersonation--sung like a Siegfried--reduced the friend who came with me to admiring and appreciative giggles. All the other singers are justly praised above by more intelligent and discerning persons than I. But I will unfairly single out the beautiful Christine Schaefer, whose glorious soprano voice soared into that unforgiving vault, the Met, reaching the Family Circle, going beyond, and, one could almost believe, reaching the heaven at which it was aimed.

Buy this DVD while you can get it at these prices.",1230595200,6,1196,4.97

3526368,4,B001D6OKV0,"When this Richard Jones staging of Hansel and Gretel first appeared it took a little getting used to. After all, missing was the mysterious forest, the enticing gingerbread house and the fourteen angels that watch over our vulnerable protagonists.
What replaces these conventions are weird and mysterious images that hew true to the story's sweet sense of adventure yet still remain beautiful within their own aesthetic.
The casting for this production was cleverly effected. Did the Met intentionally cast singers in the adult roles who are all over six feet tall?  Whether intended or not, this serves the story well as all the singers inhabit their roles with assurance and a real sense of character.
Christine Schafer and Alice Coote used the long rehearsal period that a new production affords to really gel as a team. Working with director Jones, each one brings a fully conceived character to the fore; Schafer's proud impetuous Gretel is well contrasted to Coote's plucky impish Hansel.
As the two parents, Rosalind Plowright and Alan Held perform very well indeed. My complaint about them has more to do with how director Jones views their characters. In my mind, Peter is a sweet dopey broom merchant, certainly not a wife beater and Gertrude is not the chemically dependent, despondent mess that we have here. By limning their characters thusly, the director brings their concern for the children as well as the ultimate happy ending into doubt.
Perhaps my favorite aspect of this production is the realization of the witch by the inestimable Philip Langridge. Imagine Julia Child run amok with a dash of the Marx Brothers and you might get an idea of what this delicious performance by Mr. Langridge is like. Consummately sung and acted, this is a wonderful performance of comic villainy, Margaret Hamilton would be proud.
In the smaller roles of The Sandman and Dew Fairy, Sasha Cooke and Lisette Oropesa do a fine job in conveying their characters supernatural benevolence.
Presiding over the whole undertaking from the pit is the sure hand of Russian maestro Vladimir Jurowski. He is a savvy enough conductor to know that this music needs to be played straight, without the saccharine milking of sentiment that too often comes with performances of this opera.",1224028800,12,2274,5.047872340425532

In truth, Schafer and Coote are outstanding vocalists but the awful translation of the German libretto caused issues for both leads. I could hardly understand anything that came out of their mouths, most of all Gretel's. The tenor who performed the witch was nice. He characterized the role a bit, which I didn't really care for but it worked okay.

The set and stage design are awful and disturbing. Chef Pigs instead of angels and a big open mouth instead of the outside of the gingerbread house. The orchestra sounds top quality as usual but the kitchen sets and ww2 period costumes are quite perplexing and distracting.

Even for kids, if they are being GUIDED in watching this production, will find great pleasure and education from this wonderful new version.
Never vomitting, no bad after taste if the RIGHT attitude and RESPONSIBILITY are being present when the juveniles are watching.
The production itself is beautiful and highly artistic, and the performers are ALL top-notch.
Alice Coote looks exactly like a boy, while Christine Schafer is an ideally serious adolescent Gretel.  Thomas Allen and Rosalind Plowright both played their roles perfectly, if a bit on the senior side in age (who says Hansel and Gretel have young parents, any way?)
The Sandman is very well sung by a young American mezzo-soprano Cooke.
The conducting is ultra-fine, so are the sets and costumes. The banquet scene is simply fabulous.
Lastly, Philip Langridge, in his last recorded performance (he passed away last year), played the witch wonderfully.  He depicts a dissatisfied old woman with cunning and obtuse targets vividly. I do not find the scene of 'baking the witch' vomitting at all.  The chocolate kids are also well depicted in this production.
All in all, a highly enjoyable and artistic production that should not be sacked by over-reacting and over-generalisations.",1391558400,2,1415,5.197368421052632
8291946,5,B001D6OKV0,This is a magnificent example of great theater with the set designs and costumes amazing.  It has chilling as well as humorous moments.  Not to miss is the witch climbing upon the table to concoct her poison.  Wish I could have seen it in person but this is just as mesmerizing!,1389484800,2,278,4.411764705882353
8291947,1,B001D6OKV0,"I am so heartened to see that I am not the only one to find this production of Hansel and Gretel to be offensive.  I would never take my grandchildren to see this, as my mother took me to the old Met version, and as I later took my son. Without the huge layout of cash for tickets, they can sit and watch the excellent Met Von Stade version in the comforts of their home (which production, by the way, is not only better than this version, but also cheaper as DVD!). If one wanted to update the old version, my personal feeling is that the gaudily, garishly dressed angels would be better served in simpler costumes and streamlined entrances; but NOT replaced by pigs! This production isn't appealing to newer generations; it just makes one want to do what the mother does in this version: vomit.",1386288000,2,796,4.414965986394558
8291948,4,B001D6OKV0,"Although this modern version of Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel isn't my favourite, I have wanted my own copy since seeing this MET production a few years ago. I am happy to have found it here!",1377388800,,193,4.542857142857143
8291949,5,B001D6OKV0,"A short opera, suitable even for people who do not go to opera often. Great cast and staging. All singers are very convincing in their roles. Alice Coote and Christine Schfer match perfectly together and are the best Hansel and Gretel.",1376697600,2,235,4.7560975609756095
8291950,1,B001D6OKV0,I cannot believe the Met gave up their beautiful traditional version of Hansel and Gretel (which you can and should buy)for this piece of trash. It is repulsive and totally unsuitable for children. It makes no sense and belongs in the Euro trash can.,1368230400,2,250,4.704545454545454
