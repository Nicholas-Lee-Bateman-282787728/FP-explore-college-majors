8714722,5,B00X10XZN0,"These festivals have only gotten better over the years, and this Best of 2014 collection reflects that. Buying this DVD and watching it at home is the only true way to have ""been there on spirit"" /^{;,;}^\",1433289600,2,205,4.5675675675675675
8714723,4,B00X10XZN0,"This is an excellent DVD that gives you the feel of the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival.

The first thing to note is that the video is organized just like the actual presentations at the Festival, including a nice introduction by past and present Festival Directors, Andrew Migliore and Brian Callahan.  This is a real plus for those familiar with what has become an institution over the years.

The selection of videos, all with clear video and audio, is a mixed bag - as they always are at the Festival (I've attended 16-17 of the 19 held so far). Some real standouts are ""The Celebrant"", in which the reading of a poem by an obscure writer leads to unforseen and terrifying results; ""I Am Not Samuel Krohm"" (French with subs), in which a man discovers he is not who he thinks he is; and ""There's an Octopus in Your Head"" (animated with enough energy for three shorts!). Someone else viewing the collection would probably pick other favorites - but that's to be expected.

The packaging and artwork on the DVD are first rate, equal to that of any mainstream producer.  All in all, I think the Old Gentleman from Providence would be pleased.",1432684800,,1139,4.618811881188119
8714724,5,B00X10XZN0,"I didn't buy this here, I got it as part of a KickStarter reward for backing the 2014 HP Lovecraft Film Festival. I saw some of the short films at the festival and they loose nothing going from big screen to small. I met and talked with many of the film makers represented here, not only at film maker panels & Q&A after the films & shorts, but in the pizza place next door to the theater. If you are looking for ""true to the source"" Lovecraft adaptations this might not be for you, but if you are looking for ""Lovecraftian"" horror/suspense/metal/atmosphere/rock opera then this is what you need.
I know I needed it.",1431993600,5,616,4.412280701754386
8714725,5,B00X10XZN0,"I was lucky enough to get this from backing the H.P. Lovecraft film festival on kickstarter, going to the festival is one thing, and I spent most of my time at the panels and missed a lot of the films, now I can sit back and enjoy the ones I missed in the comfort of my own home! The films on the disk are a collection of the best shorts screened at the Portland festival, along with trailers from some of the other films. I would have liked to have gotten to see ""Feed The Light"" the trailer is amazing! Overall a solid collection for the fan of lovecraftian horror, a must buy!",1431907200,2,579,4.132743362831858
8714726,5,B00X10XZN0,"Some of the shorts are pretty good, some are meh, but ""There's An Octopus in Your Head"" alone is totally worth the price.",1431907200,3,121,4.304347826086956
