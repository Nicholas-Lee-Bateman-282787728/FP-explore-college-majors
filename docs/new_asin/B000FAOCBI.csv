8119821,5,B000FAOCBI,Deep Throat the movie is a nice documentary of what happened to the reporters.  Nifty way of getting information with admitting anything.  I would never of imagined there was a story to be found out of a simple break in.,1491436800,,220,4.475

8119824,2,B000FAOCBI,"I've gotta say, I definitely was disappointed in this, which isn't a documentary per se but simply a news broadcast. ""Full story"" is a more than a little misleading: It has much more to do with Bob Woodward and his interaction with Deep Throat than anything about the Watergate Scandal as a whole. Then about three-quarters of the way through it shifts entirely over to Mark Felt and you basically don't see Woodward again or anyone else connected to the Watergate Scandal.

They would have been fine to have named this ""The Full Story of Deep Throat."" Where they screwed up was calling it ""The Full Story of Watergate."" On that point, this fails.",1461888000,,647,4.675438596491228

8119827,5,B000FAOCBI,"This is such an ""important"" time in our government and one of the first to get tape recorded of 'corruption"" In action. It is ""incredible' to know it is ""truthful"" and that the reporters are still alive. Woodward and Bernstein truly are the most honorable reporters of our times. This is very important to keep alive in our homes of what did happen with our government at such a brittle time of ""honest people"". Please bring it into your home to relive an important historical moment that still ""lingers"" to the present. I personlly feel that ""Woodward and Bernstein are two of the greatest American heros"" that still aren't getting the full credit they deserve and having you review this event will bring the good old days of ""horror sneakiness in our government"" back to life. I hope and pray that all government officials will watch this as they may be contemplating ""pulling a fast one"" on our government. You never know who is watching. BUY IT, ""TREASURE IT"". Thank you to all the people who put these tapes together for history. Eliabeth",1265760000,,1043,4.704918032786885
8119828,1,B000FAOCBI,"Apart from revealing the identity of the famous informer of the Washington Post, in the Watergate investigation, this is not a very good documentary. The narrative style is somehow superficial, lacking a real insight in the matter, almost exclusively concentrating on the character of ""deep throat"" as if we were looking at a Hollywood star biography, rather than a simple piece of a more complicated and important plot. In the end the documentary focuses on an important yet secondary character of the story. Putting ""deep throat"" in the center of your ""solar system"" instead of President Nixon, alters the whole balance of the narration, loosing the proper perspective and therefore the necessary historical depth, making this account of Watergate a sideshow of a sideshow.",1170720000,,775,5.258064516129032
