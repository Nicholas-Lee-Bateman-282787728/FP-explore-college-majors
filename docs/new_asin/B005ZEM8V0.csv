4908251,5,B005ZEM8V0,"Loved this Film.  Saw it at the premere showing at a theatre in Grand Rapids MI.  The writers, directors, U of M professor that played U of M professor in film and other support staff held wonderful Q & A session after film was shown. It is just a wonderful small production film that will have you routing for the guys at University of Michigan.",1359331200,,346,4.3076923076923075

8489566,1,B005ZEM8V0,"I only go through 10 minutes of this video.  If anyone thinks It gets better, let me know!",1408233600,,90,4.0
8489567,1,B005ZEM8V0,"This movie looked cute, but ended up being a dud. The story moves forward and the main character develops until the end and it abruptly ends. Disappointing.",1404691200,,156,4.814814814814815
8489568,5,B005ZEM8V0,Really enjoyed this movie. Not only was it entertaining but also somewhat philosophical. I recommend this movie to anyone who has had your sales down in relationships but comes out a better person.,1400025600,,197,5.0
8489569,2,B005ZEM8V0,"The plot was somewhat boring. Despite fairly decent acting, the storyline was the same old reworked nerd meets nerd so popular over the last 2 decades.",1396396800,,151,4.846153846153846
8489570,3,B005ZEM8V0,"""Answer This!"" has an interesting premise & a solid cast, but is inconsistently paced & only intermittently funny. A fine first effort. Also, the title is unfortunate.",1394582400,,167,5.222222222222222
8489571,3,B005ZEM8V0,this is nothing but a forget about real life and have fun kind of flick not a must see but cute,1391731200,,95,3.5714285714285716
8489572,1,B005ZEM8V0,"I really wanted to like this movie, and I hung in there to the bitter end.  If you are of the ""me"" generation, you will probably love this.  The characters are shallow caricatures, the plot is foreseeable and unfortunate.  The protagonist treats his girlfriend like the word on the back of his t shirt.  Just a sad little movie, don't waste your time.  Sorry to Ann Arbor fans, a beautiful place, NOT a beautiful movie.",1390694400,,419,4.533333333333333
8489573,4,B005ZEM8V0,"Tale takes place at University of Michigan where a guy is a teacher's assistant to his dad in a Bible as Lit class.  He meets a female freshman (she reminds me of Julia Styles) and unwisely decides to have a physical relationship with her.

Meanwhile, he has been unable to write his final paper due to writer's block.  So, he decides to engage in a trivia contest with two other guys and they compete.  Swearing and physical situations but no skin.  It has some profound moments to consider.  SNL alum Chris Parnell helps out.",1372032000,,527,4.553191489361702
