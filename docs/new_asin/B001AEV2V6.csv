8277257,3,B001AEV2V6,"I have done a lot of the Stott Pilates dvds.  I have always liked the sensible way that Pilates is presented.  Explanations are frequently given and for the most part clearly explained.  The one thing that bugs me about their videos is the vocal cueing.  Moira, the instructor, loses focus for the rhythm of the exercise that she is leading you through.  Also there is a point in the video where she changes her mind of whether to keep the fitness circle on the ankles or take it off.  It doesn't sound like much but it is annoying because you're in an awkward position and it's difficult to keep-up with the changes.  I think a lot of this would be solved with a scripted voice-over rather than trying to do the exercise and talk.

Even with all this, I do respect the Stott Pilates videos and will continue to look forward to new ones.",1406419200,,837,4.3896103896103895
8277258,5,B001AEV2V6,"Stott Pilates with Props Vol 1 is a fun yet very effective Level 1 workout.  After using it for just a few short months, I watched my lower body become streamlined, and I didn't have to struggle with sweating and doing a million reps.  That's the beauty of this simple, varied 30-minute workout. If you think it's too easy, try using 3 lb toning balls with it, or use a higher intensity flex band and fitness circle. I own Volume 2 as well, which is a great companion DVD, that has similar but more challenging exercises.  I highly recommend this workout when you want maximum results but you don't want to knock yourself out.",1347580800,,626,4.473684210526316
8277259,3,B001AEV2V6,"This video seemed like a few instructors just got together and went through how to use several pilates props. It doesn't seem well thought out, although the technique and instruction are sound.",1324684800,,193,5.0625
8277260,5,B001AEV2V6,"I love this workout--it's so much fun.  I love how the instructors switch back and forth, as though they are trying to out do one another.  The switching of instructors and props keeps the workout exciting and fast pace!  For a workout that is only about 30 mintues long, it is intense and thorough.  I also own Pilates with props volume 2.  Both are excellent workouts and among my favorites.  They follow similar routines, but the exercises do vary a bit (enough for me to enjoy owning both), with vol. 1 being a little easier.  Excellent buy!",1259280000,7,545,4.556701030927835
