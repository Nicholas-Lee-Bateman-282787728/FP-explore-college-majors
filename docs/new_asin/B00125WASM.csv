8244047,1,B00125WASM,"I chose this movie based upon the description and rating on Amazon. After watching it for a few minutes, I realized it was not what I thought it would be and have no interest in watching it. I can't figure out how to get my money back..",1496534400,,236,4.042553191489362
8244048,3,B00125WASM,"i could not decide if it was really good , so i gave it 3 stars,
the acting was good and the story was good too, it all made good sense,
but was the story right or not or was it believable, you could say yes or no to all the question!!
but , the tow women that have feelings for each other and they are opposites, makes this story,
this is not about lesbian lovers as much as it is about what is the right thing to do in life and make it the best you can!!",1490572800,2,456,3.663265306122449
8244049,5,B00125WASM,Finally a lesbian movie with a happy ending. Looking for Cheyenne was a great film and both actresses had chemistry. Nothing more to say.,1439424000,3,137,4.75

8244051,3,B00125WASM,"After a year of unemployment and fruitless job-searching, a despairing and frustrated Cheyenne (Mila Dekker) has decided ""to go off the grid,"" as they say.  Unable to pay her bills, she heads out on her bike to make her way in the world, sans the conveniences of modern life and a place to live.  In fact, at this point, her disdain for society and all things related to 20th and 21st Centuries technology has become a sort of religion to her.  Unfortunately, in order to follow this strict belief system, Cheyenne has to leave Sonia (Aurelia Petit), her girlfriend of several years, who is unable to bring herself to quit her secure job as a well-liked high school science teacher and join Cheyenne in her ascetic lifestyle.  Further complicating matters is that, though an avowed lesbian, Sonia is also involved with Pierre (Malik Zidi), a good-natured lad who is deeply in love with Sonia and who wants her to have his baby.

The screenplay by Cecile Vargaftig and director Valerie Minetto is distinguished by the fact that Sonia keeps drifting in and out of reality, as the various people in her life suddenly appear on the scene and have imaginary conversations with one another.  Yet, somewhat inexplicably, this conceit is dropped not too long into the film.

On the positive side, ""Looking for Cheyenne"" displays a sensitivity towards its characters and an understanding of the complexities of human relationships, but the unfocused storytelling, unconvincing resolution, and overall dour mood keep it from being as emotionally compelling as we would like it to be.

The movie earns points for being willing to explore how the recent economic downturn has affected the people of France, though the programmed sociopolitical diatribes that the characters occasionally break out into get to be a bit much after awhile.",1299283200,5,1824,4.996699669966997
8244052,5,B00125WASM,"This is a lovely French film about a bisexual woman's search for love.  She is uncertain if love exists and uncertain if love is worth pursuing.  This is a very smart film that asks difficult and worthwhile questions.

For anyone who has ever doubted whether love is worth the chase, this movie continues that provocative debate.

Love may not be defined by how much we are willing to reconsider and change ourselves, but this movie supports the idea that little love exists without a willingness to consider change.

This is a sophisticated date film that is ideal for watching with popcorn, a comfortable blanket, a private setting, and someone you love.",1218758400,11,656,4.873873873873874
