The name ""Toscanini"" translates as ""babies from Tuscan, Italy.""

Born in March 1867, Arturo Toscanini studied cello as a youth. In 1886 he toured South America with an opera company and at age 19 was named its orchestral conductor. Once back in Italy, Toscanini returned to the string section for the La Scala world premiere of Verdi's OTELLO. The composer himself was impressed with this young cellist's interpretive skills, eye for arrangement detail and memory. Soon enough Arturo left playing behind and conducted full time all over Europe.

In America he led New York's Metropolitan Opera (1908-1915), also the New York Philharmonic for ten seasons, beginning in 1926.

Toscanini's long-standing hatred of dictator Benito Mussolini led to his self-exile (1931-38). The NBC Symphony Orchestra was created for him in 1937 and he regularly broadcast on radio and then TV, beginning in 1948. This association ended in '54 with an all-Wagner Carnegie Hall show. The maestro spent his last years editing broadcast tapes and in 1957 died after a stroke in Bronx, NY at age 89. His remains were sent to Milan, Italy for interment.
