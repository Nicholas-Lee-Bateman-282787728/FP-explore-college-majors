183233,4,1562199730,"Weather Woman: The first DVD is great.  Lots of humor, nudity, cussing, some violence and not a serious bone in its body.  You'll laugh, you'll laugh so hard that you WILL cry.  Weird, sexy and Kei Mizutani who knows what her character needs AND what her fans want.  I give it five stars!
Weather Woman Returns: The second movie has a slightly more serious plot, slightly more nudity (and sex), no violence and some parts that are not funny - I think they worked TOO hard on trying to make sense.  Misa Aika is pretty and does swim about nude a lot, but she's no Kei Mizutani.  I didn't laugh as much. I give it three stars.
I would suggest getting Weather Woman by itself OR getting this collection if you can get it for less (in other words - used).  Not much in the way of normal extras on the DVDs, but they also have DVD-ROMS features in the form of art, interviews and comics.",1043107200,49,882,4.27710843373494
183234,4,1562199730,"Inspired by the Weather Report Girl anime two-parter, this live action movie takes parts of both and mixes them up.  But here's the weather--I mean video report.  JTV's ratings are such that they are dead last compared to Japan's other TV stations.  That is, until Keiko Nakadai substitutes for the usual weather report girl on the Weather Corner, flashes her undies on the air, and creates a sensation as well as  her fifteen minutes of fame.  Oh, and she becomes the new weather report girl.
True, Keiko's stunt boosts the ratings and she's given a goddess-like deference by the aging Chairman Shimamori.  However, she's a ruthless dominatrix and arrogant egomaniac, or as the Chairman's daughter Kaori put it, ""an exhibitionist nympho.""  She does know however, who fills her bowl with miso soup, such as the chairman, but she treats everyone else with contempt, especially one of her admirers, a former classmate named Minoru Yamagishi.
Kaori returns from Paris from her studies on how to transform sideline programs into feature status to keep JTV afloat in the future.  She forms an alliance with Gondo, the managing director, some of the other executives, and Michiko Kawaii, the ousted weather girl, to get rid of Keiko.
For a real laugh, check out the ""Hello, Mr. Pervert"" Michiko's new programme.  And while we're on her, she's a simpering whiner, with a matching voice, and as much backbone as a jellyfish--no wonder nobody likes her.
The main point in this movie is how trend-conscious the Japanese people are.  Whatever's the flavor of the month, they have to be totally caught up in it, becoming mindless sycophants, or risk being losers.  And marketing comes up with tie-in products to boost whatever the new sensation is.  Ditto the media, who proclaim the coming of the new trend but also herald its downfall.  Then there's the collectiveness of Japanese society, who feel compelled to follow the new sensation.  Guess there is something to be said for American individuality.
Takashi Sumida gives a sympathetic performance as the geeky Minoru.  He turns out to be the most decent character in the movie.  His low self-esteem can be understandable, as he's flipping burgers, but he's also a pathetic loser.  He worships Keiko, but at the cost of severe self-abasement.
Kei Mizutani makes the character of Keiko complex--tough as nails, competitive, no-nonsense, and sexually liberated.  A good and interesting, if naughty look at trends and the people who sycophantly follow them, but not as good as the in-name-only sequel, Weather Woman Returns.  3.5 out of 5, rounded to 4.",1028246400,5,2592,5.028103044496487

The synopsis for ''Weather Woman'' sounds promising enough: A one-time stand-in for the weather report segment of the news on the worst rated television network in the country causes a national by deliberately, but cleverly, lifting up her skirt and exposing her panties right in front of the on-air cameras, causing an equally uplifting surge in the network's viewership ratings and resulting in the exhibitionist's being hired on as the permanent replacement for the regular weather report girl who now has to plot and scheme in order to get her old job back. The devastated and humiliated regular weather reporter is not the only one at the network plotting for the removal of the shameless panty flasher who openly announces that she masturbates every morning as part of her ''daily ritual'' -- the ''Old School'' purists and traditionalists at the network also want to distance themselves from all of the dubious attention and mega-media blitz ''Nakadai Keiko'' has caused throughout the nation and likewise want to effect her removal from the air despite the spike upward in the network's ratings. Included in this ''pursuit of [a return to] excellence'' is the adult daughter of the network's Chairman, who has just returned from her stay in Paris as a result of the developing in the controversy and confronts her father on his questionable judgement for allowing an ''exhibitionist nymphomaniac'' to soil the reputation of the network.
Such a scenario, one would think, would have endless possibilities and potential. Unfortunately, this ''zero stars'' embarrassment was a waste of good celluloid and equally a waste of the good DVD disks this pile of garbage was burned onto.
This piece of trash ''comedy,'' featuring Mizutani Kei, could best be retitled as, ''Attack of the Evil Self-Absorbed Flying Monster Woman'' or ''Vicious Acrobatic Super... Must Die.'' One feels not even the slightest sympathy for either of the two villainesses competing for the coveted position of 'weather reporter' -- they are both so detestable that they have you rooting for a 'mutually assured destruction' outcome!
''Weather Woman'' seems like it's trying to mimic the look and feel of a Russ Meyers feature, but clearly without the genius of a Russ Meyers to give it depth and direction. Even hardcore fans of '70s-'80s era camp film making would have difficulty sitting all the way through this particular heap of rot and still manage to keep their beer down. (This thing makes ''Assault of the Killer Bimbos'' look like high art!) The premise is clever, but its delivery is infantile when it's not being outright grotesque. There's barely an intelligible story or plot here and the acting is just a notch above awful... which includes the English-language voice actors.
Instead of what could genuinely have been a very witty and hysterically funny wild ride, Kei and company gave us just over eighty minutes of unimaginative dreck and senseless perversion. It seems that this film was intended to be little more than an excuse for just a few steamy female masturbat! on scenes, some bogus and contrived 'girl-on-girl' situations, more breasts flying around than on a chicken farm, and enough panty shots to make ''Agent Aika'' abdicate her throne as 'panty queen' in teary-eyed defeat.
To be fair (somewhat), I did not learn until later that this film was (supposedly) based on a 'manga' ('comic book') series, so I have no idea just how ''faithful'' to the original story this film stayed -- which means I can't be completely sure of whom to properly blame for this horrid mess. (There is also an ''anime'' version of this same story called ''Weather Report Girl,'' which I have also not bothered to look into.)
If you're someone who likes viewing videos of the naked bodies of females doing things to themselves and to each other wrapped in the disguise and pretense of a feature film-- and don't mind bearing through almost an hour and a half of incoherent story and below less-than-below acting --then this film is just your kind of entertainment ... otherwise, place your bets and take your chances!",1018742400,10,4103,5.026431718061674

183237,3,1562199730,"One is tempted to suspect the feminist credentials of any male director, especially in a film featuring graphic female ..., and a not-exactly-hostile-to-adolescent-male-fantasy bath scene complete with naked women, licking and a cute maid's outfit.
Nevertheless, one must applaud Hosoyama's intentions - he far outstrips the similarly themed and styled 'To Die For' in terms of both visual imagination and ideological sympathy.  What begins as a media satire turns into a gleefully bizarre S&M martial arts fantasy.  The terms of the conflict are gendered - the sterile post-modern male world of the media and virtual reality; and the older female world of magic and nature.  This tends to reinforce stereotypes, especially when the villainess is villified for wanting to be a man, but who cares when you're having this much fun.",993686400,,829,5.312977099236641
183238,3,1562199730,"Weatherwoman Returns is not as surreal and folklorish as the original, adopting a more conventional narrative with merely unconventianal story  elements. What is it with those bananas? Enjoyable, though not for the same  reasons as The Weatherwoman- it's so ridiculous, it's good. (Yes, it is  more preposterous than the first, because it is framed almost like a  docu-drama instead of a supernatural fantasy.) The humour is certainly the  most extremely toilet driven I have seen, and is mostly cringeworthy,  though the final scenes are laugh out loud funny.",966211200,4,560,5.306818181818182
183239,4,1562199730,"Hoo boy. The Weatherwoman is a highly-sexed lady that presents (surprise)  the weather for a t.v station in a somewhat revealing style - a ratings  winner that kicks all other channel's weather programs. However some people  complain that her style is blatant and disgusting (the prudes!), such as  the station owner's daughter, a man who is easily swayed by pretty women.  Her idea is to host the weather section herself in a more conventional  fashion (ie- by keeping her clothes on - where's the fun in that?). But the  incumbent doesn't take this lying down (no jokes please) and avows to get  revenge when she is fired. And so with the aid of a lovestruck geek and the  powers of the elements themselves, she engages in a battle of weather and  wits with her usurper. Plenty of soft-core sexual suggestion will keep the  guys engaged, and the straight girls rolling their eyes. It's otherwise  it's a rather silly film that nevertheless manages to maintain an above  average rating if like myself you're a fan of the daft/alternative Japanese  style. And you really can't go wrong with Kei Mizutani - this woman has  presence. Being a guy however, I freely admit particular reasons for liking  it - enough to try and obtain a copy of The Weatherwoman Returns.",959299200,3,1264,4.755760368663594
183240,4,1562199730,"This film surprised me.  I wasn't expecting much to begin with, even though the premise was bizarre but intriguing.  (A woman becomes an international superstar as a weatherwoman because she shows her panties at  the end of nightly newscasts.)  So, the plot isn't Henry V, but that  doesn't really matter in this movie.  The plot, doesn't really drive the  movie.  It is the power of the scenes, and the anticipation of what are you  going to see next.  Toward the end, the movie gets a bit campy, but that's  okay.  Along the way, the viewer is taken on a what if? trip, one that is  part eroticism, and part humor.  I'm not quite sure which one of these, the  movie tries to be, but it succeeds on both levels.  If you still aren't  convinced, at least see this movie for the protagonist(the weatherwoman),  and her actions, her demeanor, and her ability to captivate those in the  movie, as well as those in the viewing audience. She is at least worth the  price of a rental.  Be prepared though, this movie is quite strange, and  defintely not for kids.",956793600,4,1057,4.51063829787234
183241,5,1562199730,"This is a good, fun movie about a weather report woman who becomes an overnight sensation and boosts the station's ratings through the roof when, as a one-night substitute ""o-tenki o-neesan"" (weather woman) she  flashes her panties at the end of the report. She becomes the usual weather  woman, each night flashing her panties and raising ratings around the  nation. The previous woman tries through devious means to get her job back,  but is relegated instead to host ""Hentai-san, konnichiwa!""  (Hello, Perverts), and after an unfortunate enema experience, becomes the  weather woman's personal maid.  The station owner's daughter returns from  (as she keeps reminding us) Paris, replete with an ever-present loaf of  French bread, and turns the tables, becoming the new weather woman, leading  to a climactic showdown.  This movie has probably the finest songs and  choreography ever done for a Japanese movie on the theme of meteorology.  Add to that copious panty shots, female 'onani', and a welcomely gratuitous  maid's soap-tongue bath, and you have a winner. Highly fun, amusing,  satirical, and sexy, this is worth a watch. It is subtitled, which is as it  should be. There is also an anime version, not quite the equal of this.",946512000,54,1238,5.115

7796276,4,1562199730,this is a hard to find 2 dvd collection. the stories are strange but the typical asian nudity with somewhat of a disjointed story line and mythic asian backstory. only for the real fans,1360368000,,185,4.470588235294118
7796277,4,1562199730,"WEATHERWOMAN (""Otenki-oneesan"") is a cult movie in the best sense of the word.  A box office smash in it's native Japan, and filled with outlandish characters, the film is based on the popular 'Manga' comic of the same title.

Into the dog-eat-dog world of TV journalism comes the ballsy and forthright Keiko (played by Kei Mizutani) .  Determined to become the ultimate weather woman, she turns a struggling news programme into the hottest timeslot of the evening with her trademark panty-flash.  But Keiko's day in the sun could be short-lived when beautiful rival Kaori (Yasuyo Shirashima) decides to replace her as the supreme weatherwoman.  There's nothing else for it; Keiko must go into a gruelling training regime and challenge Kaori in a match of strength and wits.  Prepare for the ultimate showdown!...

While the subject matter is a little racy, the movie as a whole is quite tame (at least in comparision with the subsequent sequel, ""Weatherwoman Returns"", which amped the 'raunch' factor right off the scale).  Mizutani and Shirashima lead a strong cast and deliver solid performances.

The DVD includes the English-dubbed version of the film, plus bonus DVD-ROM components where you can access actor/director interviews, and picture galleries.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1176940800,5,1294,5.330049261083744
7796278,3,1562199730,Like all Japanese softporn movies Weather Woman is interesting from the standpoint of allowing us to exam a foreign culture and I'm sure there are many culturally pertinent things in the movie we Americans will never understand but that's what makes it such a trip. On the negative side is that typical childlike silliness that seems to invade these kind of movies and it becomes a bit repulsive. But we don't mind do we? After all if Andy Warhol had made a movie of Kei Mizutani standing nude next to the Empire State Building for twentyfour hours we would still buy it wouldn't we?,1167782400,,583,4.615384615384615
7796279,2,1562199730,"This film has some impressive production values, but the storyline is pretty lame.  The idea that a weather girl could flip up her skirt on air and that would somehow make her famous nationwide is just silly.  There's a brief moment of eroticism in the film after a powerful female producer assigns a girl to become the weather girl's personal slave, and the girl is consequently shown bathing her new mistress, even licking soap off of her legs!  But that one scene was hardly enough to save this otherwise silly, pointless video.",1142380800,10,531,4.75
