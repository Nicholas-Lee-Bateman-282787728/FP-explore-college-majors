4112421,5,B003DW64YI,"One of the best films to come out of South America, reminded me of my maid ""Jacinta"" growing up, I thought it was going to be up for an Oscar this past year, it should have been. If you are from the US and are curious to how it is growing up in South America as a middle to upper class person, this is how it feels, excellent performances from everyone in this movie. So well put together.",1275609600,14,389,4.0
4112422,5,B003DW64YI,"This film has some of the most finely crafted comic scenes I have ever watched, and I would compare them to the old masters from Fatty Arbuckle on. They will have you on the edge of your seat. Saavedra is just magnificent in the role of Raquel, a stressed out maid/nanny to an upper middle class family with 4 or 5 kids. She just turned 41, she has chronic headaches, is lonely, depressed, and approaching a nervous/physical breakdown but will not accept help under any circumstances. We watch her face in nail biting suspense as the wheels spin in her head and she disposes of one hire after another in hilarious, vindictive style. Finally she meets a friend who appreciates her and her life and temperament softens. The film is very nuanced, human and realistic, (while being hilarious), with no lapses into sentimentality or preaching or explaining every quirk of the character: it is devoid of the gimmicks and formulas so pervasive in films of this type from both Europe and the U.S. It leaves the audience to appreciate the comedy of difficult situations in life, without needing to explain or resolve every bug in the software or sentimentalize the outcomes. This has to be the best film I saw from 2009, followed by 'Seraphine'. Whereas 'Avatar' had me snoozing, this held me upright in my seat. I hope the young director prospers!",1263859200,35,1339,4.75107296137339
4112423,5,B003DW64YI,"The other reviews of this film have covered it well, so I don't need to add more, just wanted to add to the praise.  I love this film so much.  Looking forward to seeing it again.  I find that many films these days are a chore to sit through.  This was the complete opposite.  I did not want it to end.",1326585600,,302,3.8852459016393444
4112424,4,B003DW64YI,"I was a little uncomfortable watching this for probably the first half of the movie. I didn't know what lengths Raquel would go to to scare the new maids away. The way it was done was very effective. You're supposed to feel the tension and be bothered by Raquel's attitude and actions, and I definitely was.

The acting and casting are spot-on, and the story is interesting. I really liked where they took it when another maid, Lucy, arrived. I also liked the family.

A good, if slightly uneasy watch. Very well-made!",1313884800,,518,4.619565217391305
4112425,5,B003DW64YI,"The Maid, director Sebastian Silva's effort, is delightful on all levels. A cast that buys in to all the insanity, a fine script, and a brilliant central performance from Catalina Saavedra doesn't fail to entertain. Poor Raquel, stuck in the only rut she's ever known, is in control, loved by the family she works in, but is ever reminded that she's getting older. The thought that she can't handle her responsibilities makes her panic, and some sabotage ensues. It isn't until the appearance of the free-spirited Lucy that she learns that life it out there for her to enjoy. She's suddenly a new and vibrant person. I'll say no more about the plot, but Lucy (the magnificent Mariana Loyola) raises this film to a new level. How she brings Raquel to a sensible level is well thought and presented beautifully by Sr. Silva. I watched it a week ago, but I needed some time to present my thoughts on this enjoyable film. Friends may appear when you least expect them. They might change your life, if not your attitude. A fine film. Highly recommended.",1300752000,2,1048,4.701086956521739
4112426,5,B003DW64YI,"It's not just a good movie, it's good learning. Easy phrases, real life, fun.
Watch this movie and learn, learn how to love yourself, how to be happy. I have to speak several languages and this is the easy way to start to speak. I have several latin movies, which help me to speak spanish,and ""The MAid"" is one which is helpful.",1293408000,3,328,4.306451612903226
4112427,4,B003DW64YI,"The Maid or La Nana is a sad but ultimately satisfying character study of a maid who has been living and caring for others for years, pining for their affection and thinking of these people as their family. She has no life of her own and has alienated herself from her own family and has turned in to a territorial creature suspicious of everyone that is a threat to her existence. The movie begins with celebration of her 41st birthday by the family she serves. Shortly after the party, the maid suffers a fainting spell and is rushed to the doctors. In order to help her out the family decides to hire an assistant for her. She gets rid of this assistance and the one after that in devious ways. The arrival of Lucy changes her life and for the first time she starts belonging and a sense of friendship.
Sebastian Silva direction is superb, but was it necessary to show all the maids taking a shower?, but the star of the film is definitely Raquel as Catalina Saavedra and conveys emotion with a singular expression-wide eyed and blank stares. There are a few moments when these expression change and show us what great acting is all about.
Highly recommended. 5 stars. 11/30/10",1291507200,,1180,4.544600938967136
4112428,5,B003DW64YI,"In Sebastian Silva's film `The Maid',the subtitle says it all: `She's almost one of the family,' hence when the door is closed on her in the kitchen while the family is eating, we get the essence of her dilemma. A lived-in maid for 23 years,frightened of losing her place,with the life being squeezed out of her,feeling threatened by new helps,she yet is a permanent part of the family of upper middle class Chileans. They provide her with her own birthday moment,blowing out the candles on the cake,presents from all the family,drinks to her health. Yet where is her life,her family,as she sacrifices her youth in a round of drudgery?She has no outlets,recreations,personal relationships. She doesn't know what to love or be loved is like. She holds the family together,washes cooks,cleans, gets them up with breakfast,pays the tradesmen,,has her own special relationship with the children,especially the young boys. Camilla,19,however is more independent and argues with her. She has a life outside,she is beautiful and young. There is jealousy and resentment.

Raquel is not flesh and blood,merely a servant,however long she's there. For her where does workplace end and home begin?This is the home of someone else. These are not her kids however much she loves them. She collapses with exhaustion one day, much to the family's distress and desire to help her,because she has forgotten her own life. Pilar,the mistress of the household,worried that Raquel is overworked,comes to hire another maid to help her. This is met by passive-aggression. She does this by shutting outside the house a Peruvian maid,going on hoovering, pretending not to hear. Doing the same again to an elder woman who is hired. She also disinfects the bathroom after each shower the intruders have,but this contributes to her headaches and feinting too. Sexual frustration,social isolation from her own class makes Raquel crazy and irrational. Even a new cat comes a cropper as she shoves it over the garden wall. She fights a territorial war with all newcomers. Even fighting with Sonia,the elderly maid.

So much does she fear losing the central respect and affection of the family. Like a nun she has her own windowless room and TV and uniform. No emotional intelligence. Her strongest emotional bond prior to the coming of Lucy,is Pilar,the mother of the household,who will not contemplate sacking her because she's like family. She only wants to help her. The film shot in a low-key way with hand held digital video cameras is grimly comic,leading to tension, nervousness and feeling uncomfortable. Her body is often hunched over,her eyes staring manically. She needs a day off. The only release from this tension comes with the generous natured new maid,Lucy (Loyolla),who shows her how to open up,make friends,share grief. Their relationship is emotional rather than erotic,despite the shock of the naked sunbathing scene. Offered a Christmas away with Lucy she is given a chance of sex with Lucy's uncle and refuses,possibly due to virginity. There is no redemption in this film, just a small transformation. Lucy has left,she is alone again,she takes up jogging. This film won the Sundance Film Festival award and best actress award for Catelina Saavedra,in a beautifully nuanced story with psychological depth and the reality of truth.",1289865600,,3322,5.19589552238806
4112429,2,B003DW64YI,"I read wonderful reviews of the movie, looked forward to seeing it for a long time...and ultimately couldn't watch it. The premise is great, the casting is great. It's a great movie. When the maid, provoked to an extreme degree, threatens to harm the family cat, I turned it off. I do not know if the threatened harm became reality or not, and I shall never know.",1284076800,4,363,4.432835820895522
4112430,5,B003DW64YI,"This is a master piece of Latin American filmmaking. The story present and exquisite exploration of the psyche of a character whose life long career is threaten by the arrival of helping hands to the house she works for. This film not only shows to a incredibly accurate detail the distinctive interactions within middle class Latin American families, but also explores the close connection that live in maids ( Nannies ) will develop overtime with those who they works for.

4112431,5,B003DW64YI,"I went in watching The Maid with no prior knowledge of what it would be about. So, for the first half of the movie, I just thought it was going to be about this crazy maid, and I had no idea where the director was going with this. However, after the introduction of Lucy, everything fell into place, and I understood where the film was going, and I highly enjoyed the whole thing.

The acting and portrayals seemed very natural and fluid. Everything was believable and not exaggerated. Raquel was definitely a character worth making a movie about because her attitude was so intense, and some of her actions were a bit insane.

The film was very funny, but it didn't seem like it was trying to be funny...it was more like laughing at real life events rather than something made to be laughed at.

I'd highly recommend The Maid! I think most people would walk away from the movie thoroughly entertained.",1278892800,3,902,4.555555555555555
4112432,5,B003DW64YI,"Watching ""The Maid"" (La nana), I didn't feel like I had seen this film countless times before, and that's a rarity. Sebastian Silva directed and co-wrote this unusual dramedy about a middle-aged maid in Santiago, Chile who has been with her household for over 20 years and has come to be plagued by headaches, neuroses and ill-will, the result of stresses of her own making. Raquel (Catalina Saavedra) has just turned 41, and her employers, an affluent family of seven, throw her a party. The lady of the household, Pilar (Claudia Celedon), sees that Raquel is physically spent and behaving oddly, so she hires another maid to take the load off of Raquel. But Raquel doesn't take kindly to this intrusion and viciously harasses every maid the family hires to help her.

Raquel seems to have gone 'round the bend. She's cruel to the family's girls and dotes on the boys. She drives the new maids away, leaving Pilar at her wit's end, unable to find a solution and unwilling to fire Raquel after more than 20 years of loyal service. Catalina Saavedra is nothing short of terrific in conveying the childish vindictiveness, with very few words, of this unhappy and unlikable woman. Raquel seems to have no clear idea, herself, of why she feels threatened. She is treated kindly, lives in relative comfort, but is about to crack. Her petty schemes are both hilarious and completely alienating. Mariana Loyola has only a supporting role but deserves no less credit for her portrayal of Lucy, the warm, easy-going maid who tries a completely different tactic with Raquel. In Spanish with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Oscilloscope 2010): ""Behind the Scenes Clips"" are 6 segments of short behind-the-scenes clips strung together. ""From Sketch to Screen: Storyboarding The Maid"" (3 min) shows some of the director's storyboards with clips of those scenes from the film.

8395035,4,B003DW64YI,"A touching and somewhat strange movie, about a maid who has worked for fifteen years for the same family, adopting them, perhaps imagining them, as her real family.  Naturally, as she ages, she resents the family trying to give her some help, bringing in younger people to help her do her chores.  She is an unbalanced person, and she does some unsavory things to protect her turf, but when she finally finds a friend, she blooms.  That's where the movie gets very human and rather beautiful.  Blessed with some wonderful performances, and a real sense of the intimacy of family life, The Maid is well-worth watching.",1445990400,,617,4.7924528301886795
8395036,4,B003DW64YI,"Great movie that shows social class relations in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America.  It showed a brief scene with male frontal nudity.

8395037,2,B003DW64YI,"Raquel, the protagonist of the Chilean film The Maid, is an early middle-aged live-in domestic who has been with the same upper middle class family for more than half her life.  Plagued by unexplained headaches, she is inexplicably estranged from her own family, though on holidays her mother uses two-second cell phone pokes to remind her that she does not belong.

Raquel's position with the family that employs her seems stable, but she is deeply troubled by frightening uncertainty.  Is she really a member of the family, as she likes to claim, or is she more like an aging dog, used and cared for but dispensable?  The difference is enormous, especially for one who has nowhere else to go and whose social and occupational skills are limited to what she's acquired as a liveried domestic in twenty-three years with the same employer.  What does one learn while hermetically sealed in the same home, orbiting the periphery of the same family from adolescence to age forty-one?

Amazon misses the point entirely with its editorial judgment that Raquel ""relishes the feeling of control"" when she drives off other maids brought in by the well-meaning family to ease her burden.  She drives off others because she's  terrified that her employers will learn that she's by no means indispensable, and that she could easily be replaced.  Maturity is not Raquel's strong suit, and she's painfully insecure.  But given her objective circumstances, it's hard to see how she could be otherwise.  Maybe her employers love her, and maybe not.  Either way she's no more than a paycheck away from living in the streets.  She'd be foolish not to see this.

I suspect that some of her efforts to safeguard her position will bring peals of laughter from film-wise viewers as well as from typically insensitive middle school sophisticates.  Maybe such broad-based appeal is the hallmark of quality.  Given the context in which it occurs, however, I can't see the humor.  In today's world Charlie Chaplin's ""little tramp"" would be living in a subway tunnel and eating out of dumpsters.  Given that, a homely and cynical older maid clumsily scaling a fence because Raquel locked her out is grotesquely pathetic, not funny.  Throwing a pet cat blindly over a high wall in an effort to discredit an other may appeal to a cartoon mentality, but in the flesh-and-blood world it's simply cruel.  Perhaps there's something about an over-developed aesthetic sensibility that blinds us to the consequences of living in the material world.

Following frame after frame of an unsmiling and desperately insecure Raquel, she meets another new maid.  Good soul that the new maid is, she's determined, despite Raquel's continuing resistance, to be her friend.  In no time she's introduced Raquel to the outside world and its exciting possibilities.  Implausible or not, soon Raquel is taking first, tentative steps toward independence, things for Raquel that don't also belong to the family.  The transformative experience that makes this possible is not well developed.  It's about as compelling as a brief voice-over with someone saying, ""OK, now we eat, drink, and be merry and blah blah blah.""  Everything else is pretty predictable.

Posting a hostile review of such a popular and critically lauded film will bring about as many ""unhelpful"" hits as people who read it.  I'd like to see reviews from a Chilean audience made up of viewers who are not film buffs and who don't enjoy others' unhappiness and fear.  Chile has the highest GDP per capita in South America and a single-payer national health care system.  It is also characterized, however, by a very high level of economic inequality and a high unemployment rate.  All told, the felt insecurity of a long-term live-in domestic, unwise to the ways of the Twenty-First Century, is nothing to laugh at.  The finale could be all too reminiscent of Michael Moore's film Roger and Me, now set in Santiago rather than Flint.  Getting our laughs at the expense of the working class and the working poor.  Sickening.",1372896000,,4040,4.997005988023952
8395038,3,B003DW64YI,"This Sundance favorite from Chile had me chomping at the bit given the glowing reviews.  Catalina Saavedra stars as Raquel, the longtime maid of a well to do family with 4 kids ranging in age from about 7 to 15.  Raquel is in some state of depression we are led to believe is partially caused by constant headaches.  She is seemingly overwhelmed and constantly squabbles with the oldest girl.

The mother, Pilar (Claudia Celedon), decides to hire an additional maid to assist.  First a very young one, then a very old one.  Raquel plays mean games with them like locking them out of the house.  In one case she turns a kitten loose who the younger maid had charge of.  Neither maid lasts long.  A third arrives (Mariana Loyola) who is closer in age and fun spirited.  At first Raquel tries the same old tricks but eventually becomes close enough to visit Lucy's (Loyola) family.

Lucy's uncle hits on Raquel and agrees to have sex but at the last moment makes a surprising confession.  After Lucy decides she misses her family too much to continue her employment, Raquel goes back into her funk.  Aside from a strong performance by Saavedra, I don't understand what the big deal is.  The film is shot digitally using mostly hand held cameras and for a while I thought we were going to get a horror film.  What we get is watching a neurotic woman struggle with her personal problems.  We don't get a direct explanation but there are enough clues that lead in one direction.",1356652800,2,1472,4.582375478927203

(Some spoilers)

It's just so hard to find good help these days.  Just ask the Valdes family, whose live-in maid of twenty-three years is quickly becoming a veritable case-study in passive-aggressive behavior.

Forty years old, with no boyfriend, husband or children of her own, Raquel (the award-winning Catalina Saavedra) clings to her life with the Valdes with all the tenacity of a drowning sailor holding onto a rope. Whenever the family tries to hire someone to help her with her work, Raquel goes after the interloper with an understated viciousness bordering on psychosis.  This is her territory, and she isn't about to yield a single inch of it if she can at all help it.

Sebastian Silva's Chilean feature ""The Maid"" could easily have devolved into a class-war screed, with Raquel as the representation of the downtrodden working classes and the Valdes family the embodiment of the unfeeling social elite exploiting those workers.  Instead, we get a much more nuanced and subtle look at the gulf that separates the haves from the have-nots in society.  For Raquel is hardly an inherently noble figure, what with her petulance, her petty jealousies and her callousness towards those she feels are a threat to her.  Similarly, the Valdes's appear to be genuinely nice people (especially the mother, well played by Claudia Celedon) who go the extra mile to make Raquel's life a comfortable one and  try to make her feel like a member of their family.  The problem is that Raquel has become too dependent on this extended family for her own happiness (we only ever see her talking on the phone to her actual mother).  Indeed, it takes another maid (Mariana Loyola) - a free-spirited young Peruvian who takes her job seriously but doesn't allow it to define who she is - to finally break through Raquel's emotional armor, which is the first step in Raquel's beginning to loosen up and concentrate on cultivating her own identity and happiness for a change.  We sense in the end that this journey to self-awareness is going to be a long and arduous one for Raquel, but the movie leaves us sensing she is more likely than not going to complete that journey.

Silva has directed the film in a totally naturalistic style, making us feel as if we are eavesdropping on the day-to-day life of this household.  There's even a bit of dark humor in its depiction of the ""maid wars"" to go along with all the emotional sturm-und-drang and domestic conflict.

Though there isn't a weak acting job among the lot of them, it is Saavedra's tour-de-force performance as Raquel that truly stands out.  Shy and self-effacing one moment, she is sly and aggressive the next, and Saavedra never lets us see the mechanics of the transitions.  It is a seamless piece of work that merited the many accolades it received in festivals around the world.",1343260800,,2839,4.830578512396694
