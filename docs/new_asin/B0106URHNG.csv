Julie is a very clear instructor with a lot of energy. She has her own style and will say things like Relax your eyeballs or Toesies connected, ankles connected, which makes me laugh.

You lead LEFT in this series, which may be weird for some people, but I think its good to switch it up.

The other cool thing is that for the balancing poses, she gives you time to fall and get back into position.

You will sweat, and your booty will feel it the next day, but its a great yoga workout that isn't the same-old same-old.

I am a workout junkie who loves trying new things whether its TRX, Title Boxing, CrossFit or Pure Barr. Julie is the only person who could have turned me onto yoga. Im glad I found her in 2000. Shes hilarious, full of energy, and not afraid to try new things to make yoga fun.",1439942400,,1009,4.2072538860103625
