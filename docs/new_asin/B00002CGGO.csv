Of course she's not the greatest dancer in the world, but what marvelous curves she has and what a lovely smile. The duo with Tempest Storm is one of the highlights of this DVD. The quality of these films is quite good for the 35mm features. For the 8mm and 16mm features, the quality is not so great, but they are worthwatching because very rare. I adore  Betty's clown dance  (wish I would be a clown !),  Betty's hat dance  and look for the last one called  Pin-up beauties fight . It's amazing ! Betty Page is like a diamond ! And  everybody knows  Diamonds are forever  !",1073001600,5,746,4.204225352112676
7915621,5,B00002CGGO,"Forget the old VHS tapes!  This condensed cream of Bettie is all you'll want: the clips, including title lead-ins, of her in the color films plus some loops. The quality of her early loops vary from stinky to rancid, but they are here is as good a copy as you'll find anywhere at a GREAT price and on DVD so freze framing and zooming in is a given.  The color clips are excellent and the companion DVD BONDAGE QUEEN is a great, clear collection that is matched only to this DVD, both from the same company. Avoid other Bettie titles; I've picked up some real junk. And why suffer through more of ""Variatease"" than you have to?  go to the good parts...and Bettie's single speaking role!
Highly recommended!
