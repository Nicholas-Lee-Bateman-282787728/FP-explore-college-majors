1353552,5,B00004U0FM,"""Marquise of O"" is a film directed by Eric Rohmer (Jean Marie Maurice Schrer), and based on a story written by Heinrich von Kleist it centers around the beautiful Marquise who is a widow and lives with her parents and two daughters. She is saved by a Russian count, from an assault by a group of Slavic soldiers, later on she tries to find the father of her child after having been raped while she was unconscious after being saved from the Slavic soldiers.

I did a bit of research on Rohmer born in March 1920 who was an editor and teacher before he became a filmmaker. He is well known for the Six Moral Tales features. The best things about the film are its dialogue and art and the wonderful sense of humor the actors show in the dialogue. The colors, scenes and backgrounds are absolutely beautiful every frame looks as if it was pulled from the Louvre and is a work of art. If action and plots are more your thing you may not be interested in this film but if you enjoy dialogue and amazingly beautiful scenes it should be perfect. Great acting.",1319241600,,1052,4.36734693877551
1353553,5,B00004U0FM,"I feel this is simply a perfect film.  Every element works together to create a complete vision in intricate detail.  This is a special joy for art lovers.

  Before you see this film, look up the 1818 painting by Thomas Sully ""Lady with a Harp: Eliza Ridgely.""  This painting was clearly a major image for the production team, it's simplicity and detail beautifully echoed throughout the production.  Other images here equally echo other great works of art.

  (note: DO NOT be put off by the title, this is not at all anyting to do with the infamous ""story of O."")

  The marquise, a widow with two children, feels that she is pregnant, but has no idea when or how it could have happened.  This is a very small story, and a story that could be laughable or silly in other hands, but here, with Romer's attention to detail it is a beautiful rhendition of a small family matter in post French revolution Europe.

  (I saw this after seeing Rohmer's later ""L'anglaise et le duc"" (The Lady and the Duke) which is also a great art film, technically innovative, where people actually walk within paintings in the outdoors scenes.  That one, however is more talky and stagy and slower than this.  I think this is the better film - although The Lady and the Duc is visually mesmerizing.)

  In this, the locations, the rooms, the costumes, the sets, every detail is perfect.  This is one film where you just want to stop the frame to look at a chair.

  Then you add the magnificent, flawless acting of Edith Clever (who I had never seen before), Bruno Ganz, and the entire ensemble cast.  This is a period film, but there is nothing showy or splashy about this story or film.  There are no huge special effects or action, but the small internal family workings, and a mystery.  A quiet story of contrition, forgiveness, honor and the changeable nature of each.

  This now rivals Garbo's Camille as my favorite film!",1194825600,6,1911,4.578635014836795
1353554,2,B00004U0FM,"This Franco-German coproduction is the weakest of Rohmer's historical movies (a group of films that includes such accomplished works as The Lady and the Duke, Perceval, and Triple Agent), perhaps because its subject matter seems hopelessly dated. Based on a novel by Heinrich von Kleist and set during the Napoleonic wars, it tells the tale of a young marquise rescued during an assault to her estate by a mysterious count (a young Bruno Ganz). Unfortunately, from that brief encounter the marquise gets pregnant, a huge problem during that time and on account of her position in society. Aside from a dated central conflict, the film is also dull and static, without the redeeming dialogue and interaction between the actors that one sees in other Rohmer films. The director, by the way, plays an amusing cameo as a French general.",1183680000,,832,4.9928057553956835
1353555,4,B00004U0FM,"""Marquise of O"" is a film directed by Eric Rohmer (Jean Marie Maurice Schrer), and based on a story written by Heinrich von Kleist a long time ago. That story was somewhat strange, but extremely original. The same can be said about this movie.

The main character is the beautiful marquise of O (Edith Clever), a young French woman that lives with her parents and her two daughters, leading a virtous life after the death of her husband. During the late nineteenth century Franco-Prussian war, the marquise is saved from rape by a handsome Russian count (Bruno Ganz). Overwrought by the incident, the marquise is given a potion to sleep. The following day she wants to thank the count, but is informed that he has left with the Russian troops.

The marquise of O goes on with her life, until two extremely unusual things happen. First, the count returns to her life, wanting to marry her immediately. Secondly, the marquise discovers that she is pregnant, and is immediately banished from her parents' house. But how did that happen, if the marquise swears that she has remained chaste after the death of her husband?

All in all, I can say that this movie is interesting, capable of entertaining but also of making you reflect on temptation, standards of propriety, and what is right and wrong. Moreover, the cinematography is so good that the spectator starts to believe that he is indeed watching something that happened a long time ago. Even though this is far from being my favourite Rohmer film, it is more than good enough to recommend, and that is the reason why I give it 3.5 stars.

1353556,4,B00004U0FM,"First thing - although this is a DVD - there is no control to turn off the English subtitles.  I like to do that with ""Run Lola Run"" or ""Goodbye Lenin"" - it forces me to improve my German.

I bought this movie because all the German films I own are more recent with modern German spoken, including lots of profanity - not that I'm complaining about those movies - but thought it might be good to have a film with ""Hoch Deutsch"", you know, to improve myself.

The event that this movie is centered around is disturbing.  A young woman - a widow with 2 children, who lives with her parents and brother - is at first saved from a violent sexual attack by a group of men, but then later raped by her savior while she's asleep/unconscious.  She doesn't realize that she is raped, until she becomes pregnant.  Her family does not believe her innocence to the event, and throws her out, refusing to speak to her.

The man who saved her, then raped her, does come back to the family and tries to marry her on the spot.  At that time he doesn't realize that she is pregnant.  He seems to care for her and wishes he hadn't raped her.

I won't give away the ending, but it is odd to think that someone who is honorable could have a moment where they take advantage of and hurt another human being, to this level.  And I guess the question is, once they do that, can anything healthy every come out of the situation?

All of the actors are great in the movie.  The actress who plays the widow is captivating.  I also like to see the family interact around these odd events.",1156464000,4,1561,4.247457627118644
1353557,5,B00004U0FM,"Eric Rohmer's 1976 take on Heinrich Von Kleist's story ""The Marquise of O"" is a movie right up my alley. While I'm not necessarily a fanatic about foreign films, I do love watching period piece pictures. Rohmer's picture may well be the best period film I have ever seen, and that includes Kubrick's masterful ""Barry Lyndon."" What surprised me even more after watching this film was finding out it is one of the few period pieces Rohmer has made in his long career. I read up on the man in the process, discovering that most of his other films are considerably different from this one. Rohmer is actually French, born Jean-Marie Maurice Scherer in Lorraine, France in 1920. After a short career as a novelist and film critic, he moved into the world of filmmaking in 1955. Critics associate Rohmer with the French New Wave school of filmmaking, placing him squarely alongside more recognizable names like Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. The director ran into a few snags in his early career, toiling in obscurity for quite awhile as he continued to write about film until his first hit in 1969, ""Ma nuit chez Maud."" Rohmer's pictures deal with ""arty"" themes, moral quandaries such as infidelity and clashing value systems. Some of his French stuff sounds quite above my head, so I'm glad I saw this German language piece based on a story I am at least familiar with.
""The Marquise of O,"" set during the Napoleonic turmoils of nineteenth century Europe, focuses on the misfortunes of lovely young lady known as the Marquise (Edith Clever). Her father is a colonel who must surrender the town he is defending to the Russians. One of these Russian soldiers, a noble officer referred to as the Count (Bruno Ganz), saves the Marquise from a band of rapacious Slavic soldiers. Later, when he takes the barely conscious woman to her family's house, he revisits her in the middle of the night in a scene with deeply suspicious overtones. Fast forward a bit, when the Count comes to visit the Marquise and her parents. He proposes a marriage between himself and the young lady, much to the shock of everyone involved. The Marquise tries to put him off for a bit, but the Count is undeterred. He presses for a commitment, which apparently is a big no-no in the early nineteenth century as evidenced by the increasing sourness of the father and mother, but eventually settles in to wait. A complication arises when the Count learns he must head back to Russia to fill a post, an assignment he incredibly considers disobeying in order to stay near the Marquise. Her parents are appalled-what sort of man would spurn a direct order from the leader of his country? It soon becomes obvious why the Count tried to put off his trip.
The Marquise begins to feel unwell. As time progresses, she fears she may be pregnant, something the implications of which will be disastrous for her and her family. She's not married and doesn't have any overt suitors other than the Count, so aside from a miraculous virgin birth, someone's been up to no good. When her parents find out about what happened, the unfolding hysterics are quite something to watch. Nineteenth century Europe is a place and time when an unwed mother might as well commit suicide rather than birth a child. The pregnancy places the family's honor in grave jeopardy, which the Colonel will not allow. He disowns his child, banishing her from the house to a distant country estate. The Marquise's mother is torn, at first expressing outrage at her daughter's state and then softening later. A risky plan to reconcile the family involves placing an advertisement in the local newspaper seeking the father of the child. Even I groaned aloud at such an audacious endeavor. The locals do too, finding great amusement in the fact that a highborn woman doesn't know who fathered her child. And who did? We have a good idea, but must wait for it to play out at the end of the film.
I loved this film. The movie is all about how a strict sense of honor, fused with repressive ideas about how a woman should conduct herself, play out in a small family. While we may laugh over how concerned the characters are about the situation, and Rohmer certainly laughs as well, that doesn't make for a less interesting film experience. If ""The Marquise of O"" were nothing more than a quaint little picture about moral conundrums two hundred years ago, it would not merit attention. What sets the film apart is the sumptuous cinematography and compelling atmosphere. I don't know a whit about painted art, but it is obvious Rohmer set out to create a world resembling a painting. I shouldn't say ONE static painting, as the movie looks like one huge moving painting. The colors, atmosphere, and background are simply amazing to look at. Each frame of the film looks as though Rohmer carefully pulled it off a canvas. It's not as obvious as ""Barry Lyndon,"" where Kubrick had his actors strike poses, but ""The Marquise of O"" looks like it should be hanging in the Louvre.
I suspect Rohmer's movie is the sort of project true thespians pray for everyday of their careers. No one takes a backseat to effects as even the war scenes are small and centered on the characters. What you do get instead are lengthy scenes of dialogue and tons of close-ups. If you dislike talky pictures, you'll need to skip ""The Marquise of O."" If you love conflict and moral predicaments, acting and meaningful dialogue, Rohmer's film should serve you well.",1086134400,4,5462,4.726415094339623
1353558,5,B00004U0FM,"Kleist's writing interests me because of the frailties and strengths of his characters. Is it possible to save a woman from rape, rape her yourself, seek to hide what you've done and to make ammends, and in the end still be something like a decent person? Maybe. Do good people do bad things? Yes. Is not a certain willingness to forgive weakness necessary between humans? Certainly.
Rohmer captures the feeling Kleist's story beautifully. He is careful to show the strengths of the women, they aren't passive and dominated within a patriarchal society--important in a film wherein the leading man commits rape, and the leading woman eventually forgives him.",1022976000,8,658,5.101851851851852
1353559,4,B00004U0FM,"If it is possible to be ostentatiously chaste, Eric Rohmer's THE MARQUISE OF O... is an example of it. Sometimes witty, always stunningly beautiful, the film is so self-consciously muted in style, so obviously different from the blare of standard Hollywood, it can't help calling attention to itself. It is thus not quite as modest as the style would suggest. Even understatement, pursued doggedly enough, can become a form of showing off. Besides, there is plenty to testify to Rohmer's ambitions.
Based on Heinrich Kleist's novella of the same name, MARQUISE is a perfect example of ""literary cinema,"" with all the baggage such a label implies. None of Rohmer's films are meant for a mass audience. They announce their refinement with their limited situations, articulate characters and toney references. Here, after Kleist's novella, the primary proofs of cultural worth are painterly: set in the Napoleonic era, the film's visual style is obviously modeled after Neo-classical and early Romantic painters. With a heavy reliance on the skills of master cinematographer Nestor Almendros, Rohmer uses Kleist to create a cozy, Biedermeier world of diaphanous Empire gowns, heavy velvet draperies and formalized domestic routine.
In itself, there is nothing wrong with this. Certainly Rohmer's work is preferable to, and much more interesting than, such similarly respectable literary adaptations as the bloated, otiose and cinematically dreary Merchant/Ivory productions. No matter how precious or theatrical the film may get, you never doubt that you're in the presence of a real filmmaker. Rohmer has *chosen* to reduce the experience to essentials, he's refined and polished the experience to a high gloss, so there's nary a gesture, inflection, camera movement or lighting set up that hasn't been thought out in terms of the overall design.
Which no doubt structures how most people reaction to it. If you can respond to such highly mediated and controlled experiences, you will probably enjoy the film, not just for the delicious ironies of Kleist's story, but for the elegant skill with which it has been mounted. If you find such refinement insufferably mannered, pretentious and more than a bit self-preening, you'd best stay away. For myself, this is only one of three Rohmer films that I have seen. I found the other two almost unbearably arch. With the help of Kleist and Almendros, however, Rohmer makes MARQUISE into a delightful, visually exquisite comedy of manners.",975801600,6,2481,5.299492385786802
1353560,5,B00004U0FM,"I better warn you that not everyone agrees with me on this film.  Some  people find it too understated and slow.  However, it is more accurate to  say that it is a fairy tale delivered in a very painterly manner.  Since I  am an artist, this enhances the film for me rather than acting as a  negative.  The visual style reminds me most strongly of a Vermeer painting.  If you can get into the dry nature of it, the film is LOL funny in many  parts.  This was my first Bruno Ganz, the male lead, film and I thought he  was wonderful.  Most of writer-director Eric Rohmer's films remind us of  Woody Allen's work, if he were French,  with that accompanying cynical eye  on relationships. This film is not like that except for the basic set up.

Set back a few centuries, the young noblewoman believes that Ganz has saved  her from rape one night during a war.  Yet several months later she finds  she is pregnant despite her savior's noble act that night.  This film is  also a happy-ever-after film, unlike most of Rohmer's other work.  I can't  say that this film really resembles Cocteau's ""Beauty and The  Beast"" but if you enjoyed that fairy tale, you may well also enjoy  this fairy tale.  I love both of them although they are told and filmed  quite differently.

1353597,4,B00004U0FM,"The film begins with some men in the tavern' discussing an advert in the local news. It says something like (I'm paraphrasing from the book here): the widowed Marquise von O. would like the father of her unborn child to present himself  at the Governer's home so that she may meet and marry him. This is causing confusion, some outrage, and a great deal of entertainment for the locals. The movie goes into the Marquise's story, as she comes to terms with an impossible pregnancy, the condemnation of her family and townsfolks (who believe her to be a wanton liar), and tries to figure out how she had been made pregnant without her knowing.

I gave it a four only because it is subtitled. A lot of people don't like that: for example, I couldn't get family members to watch it. Otherwise, I've have happily called it a five - its a well-made film. I didn't quite know what to expect from it at first, but 3 minutes in, I was totally involved in the story. The Russian army is invading an Italian town defended by a Colonel G, magistrate, commander of the town guard (I think) and  father of the widowed Marquise O. The house is being bombarded and is in danger of being overrun sometime after the family has retired, so Colonel G.'s family tries to flee. They are chased down by some Russian soldiers who capture the Marquise and are about to rape her when a Count, commander of the Russian forces, saves her, rounds up her family, takes them to a safe location and leaves orders to have her put to bed.

The count returns to the battle, finishes up the invasion of the town, accepts Colonel G's surrender, then returns to the home to find the Marquise sleeping heavily, albeit restlessly. She'd been given poppy seed tea by her own request, to calm her nerves. SPOILER ALERT: he feels almost compelled to look in on her and is almost drooling at the sight ...

The Marquise wakes to find the Count and his troops have left before she could thank him for saving her (something she very much wanted to do). The Colonel hears the Count had been killed in action, elsewhere, having suffered a chest wound. Soon, the Marquise finds herself feeling strange, fainting at odd times, and says to her mother, that had she not known better, she would suspect she's pregnant. Reports of the Count's death were premature. The Count returns to Colonel G. to ask for the Marquise's hand in marriage after some time. She'd vowed not to remarry after he husband's death, but agrees to his proposal in gratitude, provided they wait for a better date.

The Count has been dispatched to Naples, and it's agreed he should fulfill that commission before he and the Marquise marry. Soon the Marquise, who has continued showing signs of pregnancy, finds that, to her horror, she truly is pregnant. She can't accept the news, because knows she hadn't been with anyone since her husband's death. She feels duty-bound to tell the Count, however, who is undeterred in his determination to marry her, and who, out of everyone who knows her, is the only person who is sure she is as innocent as she claims.

And this brings the summary up to the point of the fist scene of the movie, which is where things get even more interesting. As I speak German, I am delighted to report that the subtitles are a near-literal translation of the story (many aren't). And it keeps the viewer focused - it isn't slow like a lot of period dramas, displays some humor, and shows the Marquise to be a fairly strong, determined woman, able to hold her own, and act on her will. I highly recommend it, especially for a movie binge night. The ending's a bit hokey, maybe, but it's true to the story.",1479340800,18,3651,4.53951367781155

1353604,5,B00004U0FM,"The Marquis of O is a superb adaptation by Eric Rohmer of Heinrich von Kleists 1808 novella set in 1799 during the Napoleonic wars which concerns the widowed Marquise of O (Edith Clever), a German aristocrat saved by a Russian Count (Bruno Ganz) from gang rape only to be anonymously impregnated during her sleep the same night. The mysterious pregnancy alienates her from her father (Peter Lhr), her mother (Edda Seippel), her brother (Otto Sander) and the Prussian aristocratic society they represent, while the Russian Count tries his level best to marry her as quickly as possible despite knowing her condition. What Rohmer has done here is to brilliantly invert his usual style with rapier effect. In his Moral Tales he depicts the contemporary world through the 18th century literary and philosophic Enlightenment tradition as rendered by the romantic triangle of Murnaus Sunrise. The ideas of Pascal, Bruyre, Rouchfoucauld and Stendhal permeate 6 variations on a theme which give a highly literary flavor to the dialogs of those films. In The Marquise of O he takes an Enlightenment text and translates it book in hand to the screen. He lets the ideas of the time speak for themselves whilst deploying distancing devices which retain the modernity of the Moral Tales. We see this distancing (first person narration forcing us to observe rather than participate) in the earlier films as being the influence of the Enlightenment, but in The Marquise of O we see the same distancing as being the influence of modernity, most notably the alienation of Berthold Brecht. The authors hand (Kleist through Rohmer) is kept very obvious throughout. The narrative unfolds exactly as Kleists book does with long intertitles breaking it up into a series of painterly tableaux. Shot mostly inside, scenes are lengthy, static and rendered without close-ups. A theatrical air hovers over the film, long fade-outs punctuating the action to heighten the artificiality. With the exception of Leopardo the servant we don't know the names of any of the characters and are given no personal details. Indeed characters are defined purely by their social position (Leopardo is named because he doesnt have a social position) to make the film less a personal crisis and more a social one. The conversations convey social protocol while ignoring personal emotions and one would scarcely know these are members of the same family talking to each other. The distanced treatment plays down the melodrama and sharpens the films apercus to an extraordinary degree. The actors are given time and space in which to interpret their roles intensely, fighting through Kleist/Rohmers perverse treatment. The result is revelatory. Far from the waxworks dished up by Stanley Kubrick in Barry Lyndon, these characters break out of their social straightjackets to become free people of very real flesh and blood  the story of the Enlightenment in miniature to be precise. Clever makes the Marquises suffering exquisitely poignant (especially at the point where she rejects her suitor because she loves him so) while Ganz does an amazingly sympathetic job demonstrating that within this devil a penitent angel exists waiting to make the Marquise eternally happy. The film is a stunning achievement, one of the best period dramas that I know and worthy winner of the Grand Prix Special Prize at Cannes, 1976.",1430956800,5,3372,5.16453382084095

Rohmer shot this series of 8 films over 15 years. They contain the whole Comedies and Proverbs series,where Rohmer turned to young heroines after his ironic focus on middle-aged males in the Moral Tales. In this series he consistently offered rewarding lead roles to women,notably Marie Riviere(The Green Ray) and Beatrice Romand(AGood Marriage),who rounded off the 4 Seasons as a triumphant double act in A Tale of Autumn. The outstanding episode,The Green Ray, where a woman can't decide where to spend her holiday,is distinguished by naturalistic shooting and a loose improvisational style at odds with Rohmer's usual formality. Throughout his films, characters lie to themselves almost more than to each other and this is, in part, what gives Rohmer's films so much of their warm irony and comedy. Rohmer, as a Catholic, sees the revelation of truth to them as coming via grace, in Full Moon in Paris by the grace of suffering. Whether it be the light of the sun in Le Rayon vert (1986), Rohmer interjects into the lives of his characters occurrences of the natural world that are outside of their control,or in this case it is a full moon which affects the main character, causing her suffering but also enabling a revelation. Louise has learned about choice and responsibility, and though for a time she may be saddened, is the better for it. The banality of the quotidian is invested with epihanic moments.

What Rohmer shows us in ""My Girlfriend' Boyfriend"" are the benign manipulations of people in love. He's expert at revealing the shifting geometry between the players,but Rohmer is a sympathetic filmmaker. He never condemns his characters - he merely presents them as they are and lets the viewer decide whether or not they are deserving of affection. In this case, he shows that, despite their superficialities, they are flesh-and-blood individuals, not comic contrivances or caricatures. Rohmer shows that friendship and love are two sides of the same coin. Sex is not much of an issue here; instead, this is about people connecting or failing to connect. Rohmer regards his heroines with considerable sympathy, and they're utterly convincing in their absorption in matters of the heart, and often more complex characters than the men in their lives. A Mozartian lightness, tight-plotting,a directing style of seeming simplicity,willing non-professional actors,minimal crews and everyday locations,embody the nouvelle vague's founding principles of economy. Rohmer's work is that of the total auteur from written subject to final image,powered by dialogue that reveals the character's inner life. Pauline at the Beach is a playful yet probing exploration of love and fidelity,a sunny,engaging film with captivating performances,one of the best introductions to his work. Pauline is initiated into the deceptions and hypocrisies of the adult world. Will her honesty survive her growing sexuality? Why do we prefer to be complemented rather than mirrored?

Beneath the surface of comedy in these films is a reality of pain which prevents them becoming whimsical. People's attempts to understand and be understood. In The Aviator's Wife Rohmer is confident to let his audience savour the subtle interactions among the players and keeps it vibrant. What is love to a 20 year old young man?Why do women say one thing and do another?The balance between reality and fantasy is kept. Love in the Afternoon & The Marquise of O fall outside of this main group,both are masterpieces. Rohmer was far more conservative than his fellow New Wave auteurs and broke with them when Cahiers du Cinema became too radically leftist. Despite writing about Hitchcock there is no suspense or much action in his films. Rohmer is particularly attuned to the romantic posturing of young men and women as they pursue the eternal dance. ""It is better to see all my films together as a collection. There is a relationship between all the films and that is where the interest lies."" In these last two films the cinematography is brilliantly done: many photographed by cinematographer Nestor Almendros. The sensitivity to colour palette and lighting is exquisite. He documents changing social and sexual mores. Love in the Afternoon shows 1972's conservatism.

The Marquise of O is a transposition of Kleist's teasing 19th century novella about a chaste young widow( who had sworn faithfulness to her late husband) suffering a pregnancy which she insists can only be the result of an immaculate conception. She announces in the paper that she is pregnant and wishes for the father of her child to present himself inorder to marry him. There is a public furore as her father is in charge of the citadel of their Italian town. The family chateau had been stormed and the Marquise(Edith Clavel,erotic,emotional) is assaulted by Russian soldiers and rescued by the Count(Bruno Ganz,charming,eccentric).With a hint of Barry Lyndon in the sensuous,painterly direction and cinematography. The motives of the count in offering Julietta his hand inmarriage and the longing looks which the two main `suspects' give her while she sleeps are two main Rohmer teases. Rohmer has delivered a gorgeous delight and captured the audience's heart like storming a fortress. This is in German.

`I do not say, I show,' he insisted, `I show people who move and speak.'Rohmer turned his literary intelligence into a cinematic sensibility and he repeatedly made variations of the same film,which is why he organised his body of work into related series. Over 40 years he treated the same subject 6 times over"" in the hope that, by the sixth time, the audience would come to me!"", his films deal with educated young adults from the haute bourgeois engaged in endless conversation and a comedy of manners. All I can say is what a birthday present this collection will be to anyone who receives it. What an education in film,by an articulate,resonant intelligence(1910-2010).",1381104000,6,6386,5.130643611911624
7923380,1,B00004U0FM,Hated this!  Rarely ever dislike anything enough to post a review but making an exception here.  I kept waiting for this to not be as bad as it was - for the story to have a different twist that would exonerate him but it never did.  Instead it tried to make his horrible crime alright because - it was after all committed in a moment of passionate love - or should I say lust!  How was his act in any way better then the men who were put to death for attempting the same thing?  I wouldn't recommend wasting time on this one.,1493510400,,526,4.067961165048544
7923381,1,B00004U0FM,"Weirdest movie I have ever seen.  I read all the other reviews and since there were a good deal of 5 stars along with a lot of 1+2 stars... I decided to chance it.  mistake.  It's actually kind of an offensive premise, woman is raped while on sleeping medicine, by the guy who saves her from being raped by others.  She has no idea what has happened until she realizes she is pregnant.  Long story, and not all that well done.

But somewhere about 1 1\2 hour into the movie there is a scene that makes that part of the story not so bad, if that is possible.  The pregnant woman was shunned by her family and made to leave home.  They decide to take her back and in their joy, she is sitting on her father's lap and he starts kissing her...full on mouth kissing.  He was pretty happy she was back home I guess...looked like he was trying to make out with her...pretty weird and gross.  And the Mother is there watching.

I wouldn't recommend giving up almost 2 hours of your life for this, I am still grossed out.  Ugh,",1489449600,3,1018,4.217616580310881
