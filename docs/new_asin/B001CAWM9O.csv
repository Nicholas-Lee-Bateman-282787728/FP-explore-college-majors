8286395,4,B001CAWM9O,"see my review for his other dvd , I would have the same thing to say about this one , its worth the time to listen ,listen and listen until its engrained in your brain, and take the time to figure out Kennys original hand written Tab.",1415232000,,234,4.0
8286396,5,B001CAWM9O,"Mr. Baker very generously shows us every note.  It will take a lot of practice to master any song of his, but I love trying.  Thanks Kenny!",1404691200,,139,4.111111111111111
8286397,5,B001CAWM9O,"Kenny baker video was outstanding. bowing patterns, left hand fingering, and slower version, all work well in learning the tunes.",1392422400,,129,5.5
8286398,3,B001CAWM9O,"The ""Fiddling My Way"" video of Kenny Baker included, as advertised, footage of him playing several songs and close-ups of his fingers and his bow hand. However, the camera angle was such that it was difficult to see what he was actually doing. Also, when I slowed it down the sound didn't come through so even though the fingers were moving I couldn't hear which notes were being played. Altogether disappointing.",1369785600,,413,4.830985915492958
