524636,5,6302922941,I remember this wonderful old movie from my childhood.  I consider it so good that all children should have an opportunity to see it.  It is with much disappointment that I wonder why Warner Brothers have licensed this DVD for VIEWING IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY.  This black and white movie is 70 years old and yet the rest of the world has no opportunity to see it.  So much for the so-called Free trade agreement between Australia and the USA! It doesn't surprise me that there is so much pirating of movies when DVDs are so restricted. I do hope to see it again.,1262908800,4,564,4.3428571428571425
524637,5,6302922941,hilarious!!! my eleven year old son (who wants to be a scientist) and I laughed and laughed.  Mickey Roonie is a delight and it is very easy to get past b/w because the story is so great!!!  I remember seeing this only one time before and I was about 10 years old.  It is truly memorable and about one of our own!!!,1254960000,6,315,4.048387096774194
524638,5,6302922941,"I adore this movie, and have been waiting patiently for it to come out on DVD. Now it is finally here, and I will order it today!

Mickey Rooney is a young Tom Edison in this biopic about the famous inventor. Tom's curiosity and inventiveness get him into trouble more times than you can count, and his poor father is about ready to throw in the towel after dealing with Tom's never-ending shenanigans.

In the end, Tom's tinkering proves to be more than a silly childhood preoccupation when he applies what he has learned in an emergency, becoming the town hero. Tom's father is so proud, he's about to ""bust his buttons!""

This is my favorite Mickey Rooney movie of all time! Mickey's performance, as a youthful Tom Edison, is endearing, poignant, lively, and captivating,"" a prime example of why Mickey Rooney will always be remembered as one of the most popular child stars of all time.",1246233600,7,890,4.656050955414012
524639,4,6302922941,"Tom Edison is one of the scientific geniuses that has most effected daily life in the modern world. However, as a child, his eccentric behavior and overactive mind got him into trouble. This film depicts Tom's (Mickey Rooney) early life, his fascination with Morse Code, his interest in combining chemicals, his thirst for knowledge, and his close relationships with his sister (Virginia Weidler) and his mother (Fay Bainter).

The film is shorter than most, but it covers many different stories and is highly entertaining. Ironically, in the part of a highly active and sometimes twitchy man, Rooney is much more subdued. It is an interesting portrayal, but do not expect to see the guy from all those musicals. Weidler is sweet and fun in her part, especially when she gets to pick on the town bully (Bobby Jordan). Bainter is particularly sweet as Tom's mother, a woman who understands him and wishes the rest of the world could too.",1158624000,5,936,4.886792452830188

524641,5,6302922941,"As a science teacher, it's fun to show a good, enriching, humorous, and educational film, but films like this are so very rare.  Young Tom Edison is one of those unique Hollywood gems that fits the bill perfectly.  Every year I show this film I hear the same thing:  ""A[...] we HAVE to watch a black & white film ?""  ""These old films are never any good!""  ""How old is this ?""  ""Is the real Tom Edison in this?""
Every year I start this film hearing comments like this, but without fail, kids are laughing and really enjoying the film after just 10 minutes.  After the first day (it takes two days to show Young Tom), kids can't wait to see the rest!  It's that good!  Mickey Rooney is perfect as the irrepressible Young Tom:  both charming and curious almost to a fault, Tom blunders his way into big problems and then brilliantly uses science to get himself out of the trouble.  From all I've read about Tom Edison as a young man, much of the adventures shown in this film are entirely factual, which only adds to the allure and charm of this family/school -friendly film.  A must-see for all ages, and a great film for public school use.",1008460800,188,1138,4.366666666666666
524642,5,6302922941,"Made during a time not unlike today, when America found herself in the midst of a turbulent world on the brink of war, and needed a serious uplift, ""Young Tom Edison"" is a lighthearted drama starring Mickey Rooney, as the famous scientist at around the age of 12 or 13.  While some of the events portrayed in the movie are most likely fiction, (the ending is a bit of a stretch to believe as actual history) this movie is still a delightful piece which tries to answer the question, ""What would one of the world's greatest innovators, misunderstood, mocked and ridiculed as a boy, have been like in those days?""  The casting is marvelous.  Not only does Rooney shine as the head-in-the-clouds, chemistry-brilliant young Edison, but both Fay Bainter and Norman Taurog give believable performances as hardy, hard-working Midwesterners doing the best they can to understand their decidedly odd young son. Virginia Weidler (of Philadelphia Story fame) delivers a remarkable performance as Edison's younger sister, Tannie.
The upshot is: if you're looking for a lighthearted approach to history and are willing to suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours.  Then this movie is nothing short of marvelous.  Buy it.",1008288000,4,1211,5.035

And so he is on his way to becoming America's best loved inventor.  This is Mickey Rooney at his best.

He invented the telegraph and became a telegraph operator. He printed and published his own newspaper. He assisted in creating the first typewriter. He invented the first vote recorder. He gave us paraffin paper, the electrical pen, the electric light bulb, the electric railway to move passengers and freight.
He invented the carbon microphone used in radio broadcasting and public address systems. He invented the motion picture camera and the voice soundtrack. He invented the phonograph and established the first manufacuring plant for phonograph records.
""Be courageous,"" he said. ""Have faith and go forward.""

Well portrayed by Mickey Rooney.

One of the ironies that comes through in this movie is how much more of a rigid, and controlled society we live in. In the world of today several of the 'troubles' that Tom Edison got into would likely have resulted in him being sent to reform school or prison.

And in today's public school system it is more difficult for brilliant children to excel in a particular subject.

I also see similarities between the young Tom Edison and a young Steve Jobs.  But I admire Thomas Edison more. As he built his empire, he did so with American Capital, and American labor.

The picture and sound quality on this DVD is excellent. You can quickly hop over the one trailer if you wish, and begin watching the movie immediately. No forced commercials here.",1298419200,3,809,4.583333333333333

it was easy to relate to him. This lad was always getting in trouble cause he was
different than the others. He was a thinker....
