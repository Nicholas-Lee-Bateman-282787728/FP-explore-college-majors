It makes knot tying fun!  My only complaint is that the video was produced about 30 years to late for me to enjoy as a Pathfinder!  This really is the only way to teach or learn knots.  All the hard work has been done, just pop in the disk and learn.  The publisher should tackle other honors in addition to this one.  I highly recommend this resource!  In case you were wondering it also has Boy Scout knots on the menu as a list that can be played.  The other thing I like about the video, is that after each knot is taught, there is a 30-45 second application section that shows the kids how the knot is used in real life.  Once again very well done and worth the small price you will pay for it.",1485388800,,871,4.070588235294117
8136070,5,B000H2NH3S,This video is excellent for first timers and also a refresher course for experience knot tyers. The video is easy to follow and makes learning knots enjoyable.,1300147200,,159,4.925925925925926
8136071,2,B000H2NH3S,"I was prompted to purchase this DVD because of some good reviews. I'm beginning to think that the accolades might have been for an earlier edition. The product supposedly features a section on how to make splices. When one accesses the chapters on ""splices"", each instructional presentation begins with the unraveling of the rope and ENDS THERE! No further visual information is given on how to actually make the splices. One just cannot learn to make any of the featured splices, period! Perhaps there were/are problems in the Second Edition of this DVD, which is the one I bought. Another thing I found annoying with this DVD production is the inclusion of ""comic asides"" by two young men. The humor is assuredly juvenile and the sound quality so bad that it's difficult to understand most of their inane pronouncements. Some of the sections on knots and their applications are done well enough, but hardly worth the price of the DVD. I attempted to contact the people who made this production in order to ascertain the problems. My inquiries remain unanswered. I would suggest anyone interested in knot-tying purchase a book on the subject.",1282435200,,1143,4.927461139896373

This DVD has been very useful to me as a person who loves Outdoor Activities of every kind. Living in Korea it is not easy to find references for this kind of activities in English, so the DVD has been of great help. Because of the EXCELLENT presentation and the clear instructions, I've been able to use it to teach my Korean students some knot tying techniques while they practice English. It's awesome to have such a user friendly DVD at hand.",1209513600,,792,6.7745098039215685
8136073,5,B000H2NH3S,"This instruction DVD has brought so much to the classroom, the students loved it and it was a delight to teach.  Very simple to follow and I loved all the extras.

On our next phase we are going to make rope, how cool is that?",1171843200,2,226,4.0
8136074,5,B000H2NH3S,"I highly recommend the Why Knot DVD for the beginner to knot tying.  Following the DVD step by step enabled me to learn enough in two hours to actually teach others how to tie a dozen knots at a knot tying-exhibit booth at an international youth congress. I can still picture how to tie everything from a sheepshank to a bowline. This DVD sets the standard for teaching knot tying. --Phil Johnson, Bloomingdale, IL",1099353600,4,414,4.594594594594595
8136075,5,B000H2NH3S,This is the best and easiest D.V.D to use. It lets you see step by step how to tie different knots. We used the colored rope that matched the D.V.D. which made it much easier to follow. It is much easier than using a book. You can buy the colored rope off their web site at [...] It was worth every penny that I paid for this D.V.D,1096243200,7,331,3.8823529411764706
8136076,5,B000H2NH3S,This is a must get DVD for anyone dealing with outdoor sports or recreation. This gives you all the knots that you will ever need for fun and safe outings. Parents with kids in any type of scout or outdoor group --- you will feel safer knowing that your child has learned all there is to being a well equipted knot expert.  It is easy to use and has great graphics for noting detail and practicing each knot. We use it to teach our kids.  Our daughter was one of the top kids in Illinois in speed knot tying competition this year because of this execellent DVD.,1087084800,4,561,4.233644859813084
