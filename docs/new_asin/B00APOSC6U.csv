8555734,5,B00APOSC6U,"This workout does what it promises.  Jump Interval Training follows a 4 minutes/1 minute rest protocol. It is challenging but adaptable to different levels. I cannot yet jump for all 7 intervals, but I can already see improvement in my fitness level.  The workout is straightforward -- nothing fancy, but well instructed and easy to follow.  Very nice HIIT workout.",1386633600,,365,5.05

I highly recommend this dvd.",1357948800,2,305,5.0
8555738,5,B00APOSC6U,"WOW!!! JIT is off the chain!
I bought this for my new years resolution. I have tried HIIT (high intensity interval training) and loved it! But I wanted to change it up a bit.
JIT offered just that!  JIT stands for Jump Interval Training and jump you do! But amazingly its not as high impact as one would assume. Good thing is that he shows you variations!

There are 7 x 4min intervals that get more intense as it goes!
From the first interval I could feel my heart rate and body temp start to skyrocket! By the middle of interval 2 I was drenched! I had to take a knee a few times... but I expected that in the current shape that Im in.
I have been doing this workout in the morning 3X a week (M-W-F) since Jan 1, 2013 where I weighed in at 237.4 and I weighed in this morning 01/11/13 at 230 even! I lost a total of 7.4lbs!!! Whoo Hoo!!!
The proof is in the pudding! (mmmm... pudding... NO!) LOL!!!

My goal this year is to get 'Pool Ready' by summer and I know JIT is going to take me there. Of course, with a good diet. Which is another thing! Shearill provides some awesome diet tips on the DVD!
He's not annoying like other ""DVD Trainers"" ***cough P90X & Tapout XT!*** =)  Thats why I know I can stick to this program.

Thanks Mr. Brown for a great workout and keeping it simple yet intense!

I'll be posting up another review closer to summer with my results!

8555739,5,B00APOSC6U,I would recommend this video to anyone wishing to tone their body.  In between the different workout segments there are motivational phrases that are very inspiring.  At the end of the video Shearill gives a nutritutional guide that is right on point.  This video is great for the beginner (as I am) and the experienced.  You can really feel the muscles working during the workout. I would totally recommend Jump Interval Training to everyone who wants to improve their health and shape!,1357430400,,487,4.902439024390244
8555740,5,B00APOSC6U,"This video was recommended by my co-worker, who was looking slimmer.  She told me to try it out and that it was very easy to follow.  It challenged me and was a fun workout that I was able to do at home.  Gyms make me uncomfortable and I am unmotivated.  Shearill is very motivating in this video and I kept going and didn't quit.  I have been doing this DVD 2 times a week and have lost 8 lbs in a week.  I'm sooo excited, i just had to tell others.",1356480000,3,450,3.89010989010989
