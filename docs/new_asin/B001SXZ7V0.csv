It is a very detailed information trove and an important tool when teaching others and aligning new information with the facts.

I suggest those who wish to speak authoritatively spend time with this very accurate info DVD set.  It is well worth the time and money.",1247184000,32,385,4.701492537313433
3787633,2,B001SXZ7V0,"A politically correct documentary of a people potrayed as victims, complete with Liberal consensus views on man made global warming contributing to biblical end time prophecy. Their is no biblical focus on the fact that mans inhumanity toward mankind in general is caused by mans sinful nature, and his enmity toward God. Man is responsible for all the misery of this world, but a loving God has provided a means for repairing our relationship with Him through the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. There is no explanation as to how cultures destroy themselves by turning away from God and biblical truth. The Jewish story is not one hopelessness as it is portrayed in this documentary. In the end God will fullfill His promises toward His choosen people and all believers in Christ Jesus. This documentary is a onesided Liberal view focusing on a victim-hood ideaology. It does a horrible injustice to all those seeking truth from a biblical world perspective.",1244419200,34,954,5.0062893081761
3787634,5,B001SXZ7V0,"This is excellently done and gives you a whole new picture of what is going on in Israel, especially the individual cities",1387584000,2,122,4.590909090909091
3787635,5,B001SXZ7V0,"After visiting Israel, I fell in love with the country and the people! This series helps to give me a better understanding of the culture there and also takes me back there. Love it!",1386633600,2,182,4.382352941176471
3787636,1,B001SXZ7V0,"Basic information. Christian based.  It didn't take long for Christianity to become throurghly corrupted. (spelling-remember I'm dyslexic) Why does each disk show the star of David cracked and broken?!  What is this supposed to mean!
What do I mean by corrupted:
Read about the council of Nicaea. This is where Catholics so hated the Jews they wanted to make a complete break with them.
This resulted in passover being changed to Easter.
The doctrine of the trinity
The change of the sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.
I could list many more things like It is not good for man to be alone to Paul's its better not to marry
All food is now allowed-but not meat mingled with the blood.  I guess this means your pig should be killed according to Jewish law. When you take your pig to be slaughtered be sure to wear a fast pair of running shoes!  This all sounds very silly doesn't it, it does to me also!",1384819200,,899,4.4969325153374236

3787638,5,B001SXZ7V0,"IF THIS DOCUMENTARY IS ANYTHING LIKE ISRAEL, A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME, IT WILL BE TERRIFIC.  I LOVE THIS KIND OF FILM FOR MY LIBRARY, THEY ARE TIMELESS,  AND WONDERFUL FAMILY  TIME AND VIEWING.",1373760000,2,191,4.7272727272727275
3787639,5,B001SXZ7V0,"This is one of my favorite series on the history of the Jewish People. They are indeed God's Chosen People, and have suffered greatly in the past for their forgetful nature of God's Requirements. The remarkable accomplishments of the Jews since their prophecied return to Israel in 1948 illustrate their ranking in the achievment of the nations of the world. The supernatural nature of antisemitism embarrasses most of the countries on earth.",1369267200,9,442,5.152777777777778
3787640,5,B001SXZ7V0,Israel is an amazing nation.  An Inspiring people.  A Journey Through Time is very well done.  I enjoyed it immensely.,1361750400,5,118,4.8
3787641,1,B001SXZ7V0,"I rated this one one star meaning, ""I hate it."" Hate is a word I don't use often and never lightly, but it applies here as I feel this (at least disk 5- haven't gotten up the fortitude yet to inflict disk 6 on myself) is perfidy in its most virulent form. This DVD set is so egregiously biased that I have to put in my two cents worth. I have been studying Islam (as a devout Christian) for the past six months and purchased these DVDs on the basis of a review calling them 'balanced.' I am accustomed to finding most resources slanted one way or the other on the issue of Islam and particularly the Arab-Israeli conflict-that's nothing new-but the degree of blatant one-sided information here is on a whole new plane.

If your are looking for a resource (as I was) to aid in fairly representing both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict to a group, look again.  It was VERY difficult to even make myself watch the entirety of DVD 5. There were so many counterarguments which the narrator and other commentators entirely ignored. I believe, and sincerely hope, that this sort of hateful rhetoric will only be acceptable to the most vehement anti-Palestinian Israeli. If that doesn't describe you and yet you purchase this set, please be sure to take everything said as hardline Israeli propaganda, and do some reading to find out what other views and evidence are out there so that you can intelligently make up your mind based on input from all sides. I'm not taking either side on these issues; I just like to see both represented fairly.",1312156800,7,1538,4.568840579710145
3787642,4,B001SXZ7V0,"I loved watching this series.  This is a detailed account of the history of Israel and an important educational tool.

The film is quite balanced in depicting the three religions originating in the area and their connection to the land yesterday and today.",1270771200,21,256,4.930232558139535
3787643,5,B001SXZ7V0,"This is one of the most amazing pieces of history depicting the three religions originating in the area, and their connection to our lives today.

I enjoyed it so much that I gave it to a good friend (Jewish) that needed enlightening.

As you progress through the discs, you yourself will find yourself wrapped up in the details that help you learn why it important today to respect each religion.

8340243,3,B001SXZ7V0,There is sufficient of interest in presentations to be of value.  Yet much of the scenery is repetitive lacking variation.  Also I found the scriptural dispensational application of Israel's circumstances to be inaccurate.,1406592000,2,222,5.696969696969697

8340245,4,B001SXZ7V0,"I actually rented this series via Amazon Prime. It must first be acknowledged that the history of Israel is long and that this series can only cover so much of that in 6, 40 minute episodes. This is really a good series for those that need a nice overview of Israel's history.  For anyone seeking a robust, detailed documentary, this will not satisfy that desire.  While I have a fair knowledge of the history of Israel, I still enjoyed listening to this documentary.",1393200000,5,467,4.614457831325301
