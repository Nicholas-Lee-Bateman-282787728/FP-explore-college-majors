5161569,5,B008H5J510,"Highly loved the documentary, even though I usually am not into such things. Never knew about Katy Perry's life and how hard things were for her. Right after the short presentation on youtube, I knew I had to watch it. It gives a lot of information on her which I knew nothing of, including her wonderful personality. This 1 hour documentary will be useful for any of the Katy Perry's fan.",1341792000,12,389,4.492957746478873
5161570,3,B008H5J510,"This is a fun movie. With a lavish concert in 3D plus the colorful personality of Katy Perry, it'd be hard to accuse this movie of being boring. It will certainly appeal to Katy's fans, and it will also appeal to non-fans for a peek at the life of one of the biggest musical celebrities since Michael Jackson.

The lead producer is Brian Grazer, who is one of the most prolific and successful producers of dramatic thrillers (The Da Vinci Code, American Gangster, Robin Hood, 24, Tower Heist, Cowboys & Aliens, etc.). I'm guessing that Katy picked him primarily because of his work on Eminem's ""8 Mile.""

I am calling this a ""movie"" instead of a ""documentary"" because Katy Perry is one of the producers, which means that it cannot honestly claim to be impartial or unbiased. Boxoffice Magazine criticized the movie for that reason, saying, ""this supposedly honest behind-the-scenes look at Perry's 2011 world tour often feels more like sharp brand management."" What's particularly troubling is that the movie alleges to show ""vulnerable"" moments, like an unseen camera supposedly capturing a dejected Katy in her dressing room struggling with her deteriorating marriage. Maybe such moments are real, but even so, it seems seedy to include them in the final cut.

It sometimes felt like I was watching a 97-minute advertisement. It managed to be enjoyable regardless.",1341705600,21,1366,5.008810572687224

5161572,5,B008H5J510,Adorable movie.  Lots of fun.  I saw the movie tonight with my 6 year old daughter and she was enchanted.  The music is great and the back story is wonderful.

5161573,2,B008H5J510,"Look, I know if you are a ""fan"" of Katy Perry and the image she projects, you'll think this ""movie"" is Citizen Kane. Me, being a Seventies and Eighties kind of guy, I actually like several of her songs, and she doesn't look too bad on stage. However, she isn't John Lennon, Bob Dylan or even Madonna; she just isn't that interesting outside the music. All I want is a full-blown concert video without all the ""part of me"" stuff. This is the third DVD she has released that is mostly about her life, her fans and what people say about her. She's had one decent album and a half-dozen hits to her credit, and that warrants all of this??? I don't want to know Perry the narcissist, I just want to see a dern concert film.",1341619200,4,718,4.248175182481752

5161592,5,B008H5J510,"Five SUPERB Stars! This is an excellent, fast-paced 2011 documentary, ""Katy Perry-Part of Me-The Movie"", filmed during the Katy Perry ""California Dream Tour"". In addition, there is extensive background information about the pop star. Using her worldwide tour as a starting point, the video shows the young Katy Perry when she and her friends were dreaming of future fame and some of her performances, plus commentary by her parents, manager, and young, professional people who were given their first big chance by Perry.

Based on their religion, most pop music and films were not allowed (Sister Act-2 was allowed), so she grew up basically singing religious and patriotic music on stage. But when she saw her first Alanis Morisette video, everything changed about her approach to music.

Meanwhile, back on the tour, it took 7 tour busses and 16 trucks to move the 2-hour show around the USA, the colorful performances are truly first-rate in music, dancing, costumes, and lighting effects, plus the mind-boggling 'dress changing' stunt. Some of the songs are ""Hot N Cold"", ""Part of Me"", ""Hummingbird Heartbeat"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and much more.

The video also addresses her brief marriage to Russell Brand, as she repeatedly flew thousands of miles to see him for 3 days each time and then back to the tour, only to ultimately see the marriage fail. But she carried on, despite the heartbreak, thrilling her fans while breaking sales records. Produced by Katy & Academy Award-winner Brian Grazer. Directed by Dan Cutforth & Jane Lipsitz, this is a very enjoyable but also frank and revealing Katy Perry video. My Highest Recommendation. Five FABULOUS Stars! (Paramount, Insure films. Rated-PG.

5161619,5,B008H5J510,"As this documentry of her tour proves, in or out of makeup Katy Perry is HOT..very hot..probably the most gorgeous woman in the current pop music scene. She also has a big heart and while on a gueling tour she gives her all at the meet and greets to her fans,to her crew backstage ,in her performance and runs herself ragged to fly to be with her husband on her very little time off. In his cameo, its easy to tell that its all about him..so since he decided to divorce her DURING this tour, I won't mention his name here. This is a good warts and all look into the fact that touring is a lot of work and hearbreak and not as glamourous as some people think it is. It also shows off Katys' talents as a singer/performer and that she doesn't need to surround herself with a lot of distracting spectacles ( dancers, costume changes, special effects ) to entertain and be the artist she is.",1440633600,3,887,4.254437869822485

5161624,4,B008H5J510,"I liked Katy Perry's music before I saw this movie, although at first blush I thought she and her themes lacked depth -- she's mostly about the thrill of sex and partying, which can only take you so far. But thanks to this film, I now understand her roots, and she makes perfect sense: her career was launched on a giant, public, explosive rejection of a Pentecostal upbringing filled with intense repression. So, understandably, she went over the top. And her music has always had catchy hooks.

But the movie doesn't fully strike a powerful chord until the end, when we see Katy struggling with a marriage that's crashing and burning, yet still she has to prop up her enormous worldwide tour. It's like reality TV at its most gripping: we see her crying, exhausted, physically and emotionally broken and unable to go on, while a huge area crowd chants for her up above. Will she cancel the show and send them all home disappointed? What follows is great theater. A ""wow"" finish.",1439078400,6,980,4.664739884393064

5161669,5,B008H5J510,"Made me laugh and made me cry. This movie is warm, open and positive. It's a beautiful series of little moments all strung together, or a joining of the dots. It's exactly what you would expect and we do get to see why people look up to Katy Perry in such a way. Is it her music? Okay, but lots of artists have good music. Is it her fashion? I don't think that's it either. I think people look up to Perry because her personality is just so likable, and she's faced relatable issues and real life problems. The concert footage made me wish that a full 3D concert movie was available. IF you're a fan, you'll love this.",1419811200,,618,4.201680672268908
5161670,5,B008H5J510,"Part of Me packs emotional punch!. Sometimes sad, but true and real. Watched it twice already. Great insight into Katy's world includes the break up with Russell Brand. Totally worth seeing, if you are a Katy fan - you must watch this. Fantastic!",1419552000,,246,4.744186046511628
5161671,5,B008H5J510,"I am a rocker. I love THE BYRDS, HOLLY BETH VINCENT, JEFFERSON AIRPLANE, THE SEX PISTOLS, TELEVISION, TOM VERLAINE, FAIRPORT CONVENTION, RICHARD THOMPSON, LUNA, MOBY GRAPE, BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD...those may not be metal ( I like HALESTORM though), they ARE some serious rock heavies. Why would I buy a Katy Perry movie and her cds. I wish I could say it was her fabulous body, which although sexist, would be simple. The fact that she's gorgeous does not hurt, although I have no intention of seeing her live. The thing is is that her music bounces, it's fun and often makes you feel good. She sings like a rocker and not a white girl rnb imitation...damn I hate when Britney Spears does that. If Katy was doing hard rock, her voice would actually have a kind of Grace Slick quality, but she doesn't do that. She doesn't get too serious and doesn't take herself too seriously. She isn't a poet and isn't flying Eight Miles High on LSD, although those stage sets....:-)  Her voice really isn't ""pretty"" and has a ""balls, or in this case t&ts to the walls"" quality. If she wanted to go hard rock, she could, easily. That's not where she's at. ""Wide Awake"" shows some psychedelic moments though.

Anyway, the film is a good biography. Don't buy it for a concert film: it isn't. You can get those a dime a dozen on bootlegs. Buy this if you want to see what kind of person she is. I doubt that she's perfect, but she doesn't come off loke some spoiled diva in here, but rather a pretty normal person. I like it and it's on my shelf flanked by THE SEX PISTOLS: THE FILTH AND THE FURY and FLY JEFFERSON AIRPLANE. What the heck...",1419552000,,1621,4.454545454545454

5161784,5,B008H5J510,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Katy's rise to fame, and getting up close and personal with her.  She is a talented and highly creative person with a flare for cartoon magic and fantasy!  She comes across as being sincere, honest, real, and vulnerable.  I like that in a person, even people I don't personally know.  And I don't think that's an easy way to be in the wild world of entertainment.  I valued her interactions with her ""peeps"" and family.  If it was staged, it was very convincing!  Everyone had glowing reviews of her as a person, a sister and daughter, grand daughter, an entertainer and as a friend.  Katy has NEVER been a publicity idiot like so many pop stars, she has earned her fame without being anything but real and talented in her own way.  I think that's what gives her so much believability and charm!  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who loves her music, and to anyone who wants to get into the business!  She worked hard, held fast to her values and is a good mentor for an aspiring singer-songwriter!  WATCH IT, you'll love the music and get a glimpse into the real world of Katy!",1391558400,2,1110,4.495

5161799,4,B008H5J510,"At first, I was skeptical of watching this movie. But I'm so glad I did. While many of her tunes are catchy, I never really considered myself a ""kitten"" (Katy's fan base.) Seeing her behind the scenes; her back story, and her struggles; made me a fan. While so many people and organizations tell people ""be someone else,"" Katy responded to such individuals with ""I don't want to be the NEXT anyone, I want to be the FIRST Katy."" After working in a church where the pastor's main lesson to staff was ""go to conferences, find out what bigger churches are, and become that in this church"" I am very appreciative of an artist with a spirit of individuality and originality.

Inspiring.",1390089600,,681,4.581967213114754

She is a sweetheart, extremely talented as both a singer and songwriter, and very loyal to her fans. That took a lot of strength on her part to keep going on with her tour after the crushing blow of her divorce looked ahead.  There's no calling in sick when 30,000 fans are waiting.

5161836,4,B008H5J510,"Before I saw this movie, I really knew nothing about Katy Perry or her music. I guess I had heard the ""Teenage Dream"" song in everyday culture, but for all intents and purposes, I'm too old for teen-pop!

That said, this was somehow the ONLY option for entertainment on a long flight last year (other than old TV sitcom repeats), so I gave it a try. In short, I guess I kind of fell in love with Katy. She's adorable, kind, funny, unique, and a normal scared young adult. I'll admit, I cried with her a couple of times, in the midst of her absolute exhaustion on tour and dealing with the painful heartbreak.

The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was how oddly one-sided the coverage of her divorce was portrayed, as it just seemed like too much of a cheap shot.

Other than that, it's a great view into the grueling world of super-stardom with a gal who seems to be a true American sweetheart.",1388102400,,907,4.323529411764706

5161838,5,B008H5J510,"There are some very miserable spiteful reviews on here. They usually contain such revelations as 'I don't like Katy Perry's music and hated this movie'. Er... what are you doing watching a film about Katy Perry if you don't like Katy Perry's music. I know, you came to be bored and to dislike it and you succeeded. The film contains a very revealing and surprising story about a genuinely gifted songwriter breaking out of her strict religious upbringing and rising to the very highest peak that anybody could possibly wish for. She did it through shear determination and spirit. She did not get it handed to her. She was in fact jerked around by all the record companies and almost sunk until, in one memorable quote, one of the young female execs stole her music from the company and 'snuck out' with it, so that she would be free to find success at another label which had people of some imagination and vision instead of the lame egotistical dicks that she was tied to at that time. Her message is absolutely positive, absolutely empowering and liberating for young girls, and the concert footage shows just how transcendent that message becomes for them at the live shows. She is not sleazy or nasty or stupid. If I had a daughter I would strongly approve of her being a 'Katy cat'. I enjoyed every minute of this documentary.",1387670400,3,1331,4.6440677966101696

My 14 year old is also cerebral palsy and legally blind so for her to connect the ""real"" Katy Perry to the music on the radio is entertaining to her..I recommend for all Katy Perry fans!",1387238400,2,297,4.0508474576271185
5161843,5,B008H5J510,A very well done inside look into Katy's world. Amazing to see how she became a household name! Made her more relatable and made you feel like you really know her. At times it was heartbreaking because of how real she was during her marriage breakup. Walked away from it with a greater respect for Ms. Perry. Loved it!,1387238400,,318,4.406779661016949

5161845,5,B008H5J510,"This was a rather honest biography of Katy Perry on her first major tour.
Combines behind the scenes storyline with on-stage live performances.

It is also suitable viewing for children since it does not contain any foul language or nudity. Short web video outtakes of actual Katie Perry fans, expressing what makes Katy Perry an amazing artist are very inspiring at the beginning and end of the film.

It is a film I look forward to inviting my children to watch. Even if you are not a fan, it is an uplifting tale of how hard work and perseverance can pay off, reminding all of us to pursue our dreams.",1387238400,,604,4.4818181818181815

5161849,3,B008H5J510,The movie is entertaining and keeps moving.  This was not my normal movie choice but I did enjoy the show.  No story line to speak of except one big tour.,1386201600,,154,4.1
5161850,4,B008H5J510,"This movie surprised me. The documentary was deep and powerful and clearly a snapshot of an actual year in her life, not just a specific message. I loved getting to see more about her background and felt like we got to know her more as a person through this movie. I liked her music before, but I like it even more now!",1386115200,,319,4.161290322580645

5161853,4,B008H5J510,The show features several of her songs following her along a year of touring.  It gives a background as to whom Katy Perry is and how she got to where she was at that point.  The coloring of the costumes was very neat.  It also gives a better understanding into her cast.  She is quite a character.,1385424000,,298,4.175438596491228
5161854,5,B008H5J510,Katy is delightful and charming. Her music tells a story most can relate to. The performances are colorful and cute.,1385164800,,116,4.85

5161858,3,B008H5J510,"If you're expecting a lot of contiguous concert footage and music, this is not for you. There are occasional concert clips spliced into a lot of ""behind the scenes"" footage.",1384560000,,173,4.8

5161863,4,B008H5J510,"Really good movie... my daughter begged me to take her to see it and I ended up enjoying it right along with her. There were a couple of parts in the song ""Peacock"" and ""I Kissed a
Girl"" that I felt were a little questionable for younger Katy Perry fans but overall the movie was very entertaining. My daughter and I really enjoyed it.",1383696000,2,335,4.25
5161864,4,B008H5J510,"I am not what you would call a Katy Perry fan. I have found most of her music pretty predictable pop, but in this movie she comes across as a very engaging and sympathetic character-- a real person-- who has a very interesting story. It also shows her in many scenes without all her makeup, looking like a normal girl you might pass on the street. She obviously has a good head on her shoulders and has surrounded herself with good people, including members of her family. I would recommend this movie-- you will find you like Katy Perry!",1383523200,,538,4.444444444444445

5161866,5,B008H5J510,"I'm embarrassed to admit, but I'm in my 40's and I love - love Katy Perry!  I love her music and she is such an inspiring role model for all ages who outshines other female musicians that try to get exposure by exposing themselves to a ridiculous degree (AKA - Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga).  While sex sells, it is anything but art and Katy Perry in this film displays how she persevered and had the courage to come out on top by being herself and showing how to be a true artist.  There were awkward moments in the film, but I thought it was well done and fun to witness Katy's rise to stardom.",1383091200,,593,4.139130434782609
5161867,5,B008H5J510,This was an insightful look into this young woman's life for a year. What were her managers thinking? She is hard working and ever the professional giving it her all even though the constant shows start to mentally and physically take a toll. She even performs through heartbreak. Ms. Perry is obviously talented and appears to be a really nice person to boot.,1383091200,,360,4.73015873015873

5161870,4,B008H5J510,"I didn't really know Katy Perry until I saw the movie.  While it's not riveting, it is good entertainment, especially if you did not see her in concert.  I do feel like I ""know"" her after watching her autobiography and I like her more because of it!",1382918400,,249,4.276595744680851
5161871,5,B008H5J510,"I kind of wish I didn't see this.  Before I did I was completely indifferent to Katy Perry.  I didn't like her or hate her.  I just didn't care either way.  Then one day I sat down and watched this after hearing some rave reviews about it from critics and I fell in love with her.  After watching this I discovered things about this Katy Perry character I didn't know anything about.  She was likable and nice.  There wasn't a diva bone in her body.  I sort of equate female pop stars to being a little full of themselves as if they're curing cancer or something.  I realized that Katy Perry is a hardworking girl who loves to entertain, sing and play the guitar.  There was some poignant moving moments in this as she allows the cameras to continue filming even when she's visibly heartbroken over the problems with her relationship at the time with Russell Brand.  I also didn't know that she writes her own lyrics and that they are from her personal experiences.  That made me like her even more that she allows herself to be cracked open in her work.  I learned that she didn't have it all handed to her and had to fight to create a career.  Sure this is a little cotton candy and bubble gum-ish, but its done so well that you find yourself being uplifted.  I'm embarrassed to say that I loved this and became a fan of Katy Perry by the end of this.  But hey if she can be that cracked open in her lyrics, I think I can be just as cracked open to admit that I like Katy Perry!  Ended up buying this DVD after watching it and of course then ended up buying two of her CD's since I didn't own anything Katy Perry related.  ""Teenage Dream"" and ""Prism"".  It's a good thing she made this movie, otherwise I probably never would've given her a chance.  I'm not particularly a big pop music fan, but it seems like she's one of the better ones out there.",1382832000,38,1850,4.2464183381088825
5161872,5,B008H5J510,"This is more of a documentary about Katy Perry than a movie, but I don't care what they call it:  It is really, really good.  You get to see how Katy Perry grew up with a strict Christian upbringing (her father was a reverend) to how she finally heard rock music at a friend's house and was hooked!  She is adorable and has kept a lot of those values from her childhood (NO TWERKING for her!).  She has such a generous heart that before every concert she has a ""meet and greet"" with a lot of her fans and is especially wonderful to children.  You see how taxing it is on someone's personal life to tour and even how physically draining it is.  The cherry on top is getting to hear so much of her music and watching the energy in her concerts.  This would be interesting to anyone who wants to learn about ""the making of a rock star"", not just Katy Perry fans.",1382832000,,859,4.16969696969697
5161873,5,B008H5J510,"I always knew that Katy Perry was inspirational. After watching this movie I see her in a brighter light. Katy is a genuine artist who loves what she does and her fan are what keeps her going! She had this dream while growing up to be just her and show people its ok to be you and she did that, but she had to work at it and she worked hard. Katy really did love Russell Brand. I cried like a baby who is teething because I could see the pain and the devastation behind those blue eyes, it was written in her body language, but in the end she pulled it together because her fans will always be there for her. I highly recommend this movie for all ages who understand the little necessities of life. Great family movie. I am an even BiGgEr KaTy CaT fan now.",1382486400,3,756,4.080536912751678
5161874,4,B008H5J510,"This movie is more in documentary fashion than ""movie"" fashion and it's very insightful and entertaining.  It show cases the 1 year of Katy's life where she was on her big tour.  I absolutely loved seeing the production quality of her show, the amount of time/effort that went into putting on this touring, and hearing much of her music.  This movie also documents some of how she got started in her career, her background, and her marriage.  Overall, great movie.  Appropriate for all ages.",1382400000,,491,4.7976190476190474
5161875,5,B008H5J510,"I love this movie. I learned a lot from her life: how she struggled getting a record out and proved people who didn't believe in her wrong. She's really genuine and funny. I'm a big fan! The special features are great, too: full length performances of ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" and ""Waking Up in Vegas"" and a bunch of other adorable clips. Worth buying and highly recommended!",1381708800,4,381,4.701492537313433
5161876,5,B008H5J510,"I absolutely love Katy Perry and I absolutely love this movie. It has a perfect balance between Katy's offstage and onstage life. The movie really made me feel emotionally for Katy. I loved the parts after the concerts when she did the meet and greets. It just made me want to hug her! This was one of those good movies that made me cry when the main character was crying. I also really loved the parts when she was in concert. I love all her clothes and it was weird to see her without makeup on. My favorite Katy Perry song, Part of Me, is the title of the movie. I think this title suits the movie very well. The movie is all about being yourself and not letting anyone keep you from being you. That song is my favorite because of that theme. Overall, I think this movie is amazing and inspiring to everyone, not just Katy Perry fans, and I completely and totally LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie. I would recommend it to anyone. :D",1381622400,,930,4.259887005649717

5161883,4,B008H5J510,"Katy Perry is a new talent to me, and I knew very little about Katy Perry before I watched this program.  I knew she had pink or blue hair, but I learned that is only a very small fraction of the person Katy really is.  Katy impressed me with her talent, devotion to her fans and to the people who have helped on her journey, and the love she has for her family.  All of her family may not appreciate what she is doing, but she respects their opinion.  I wanted to cry when the film documented her sadness when her marriage dissolved.  That segment was so sad, but she was so courageous to perform for her fans instead of wallowing in self pity.  Katy Perry has a new 'older' fan.",1379980800,,680,4.152671755725191
5161884,5,B008H5J510,"I really loved this movie because Katy Perry opened up to us and let us get a view of her work and personal life. The movie also shows how shes not an overnight success. Also, explains how growing up with her family impacted the way she is today. Last but not least it shows how dedicated she is with her music. She is a great song writer and all her songs come from her life experiences. I really recommend this movie, its very inspiring ! :D I LOVE YOU KATY PERRY <3",1379808000,,468,4.0978260869565215
5161885,5,B008H5J510,I really loved the movie. I'm not really into concert movies but this was definitely more about her as a person and how she has grown as an artist. Plus the love that she really does show for her fans is really amazing. You don't see a lot of that with someone famous.,1379635200,,268,4.0754716981132075
5161886,5,B008H5J510,"Had no idea I would like this as much as I did.
It's shot well, edited to keep your attention and has a pretty interesting slant on the price of fame from someone who seems to know that price but it still glad to have the opportunity to pay it.

Katy is fascinating in that she really is talented, gorgeous and has a personality that really shines. I always had issues with some of her multiple songs about glamourizing sexual experimentation and binge drinking, but it makes more sense where she's coming from after watching.  And even though the blue hair and need for attention and to please might be annoying, I have a feeling that Russell Brand missed out on someone WAY out of his league.",1379548800,,694,4.456692913385827
5161887,5,B008H5J510,I loved watching the journey she has been on through her career and that her earlier work is also mentioned in the film. She is a great person and humble artist who appreciates her fans so much they can feel it.,1379462400,,211,4.170731707317073

Every aspect of life doesn't always turn out like the the fairy tale one hopes for, but you keep on, and hold on  - sometimes people just aren't a fit in this chapter of life.  But chapters close and new ones begin.  God may have a perfect fit for you further on in life.  I like Perry's gumption and character - a brave young lady.",1378771200,,431,4.132530120481928

5161895,5,B008H5J510,"This very personal look into the life of artist Katy Perry during her tour, marriage and breakup from husband Russell Brand is almost too much information. The emotional roller coaster of Ms. Perry's life mirrors her music and still her fans love and support her. It's almost like seeing the man behind the curtain, killing the illusion of success equals happiness. For the concert sequences I would hardily recommend this to anyone. For those who want to keep the mystery alive I suggest skipping this one and buying The Smurfs.",1378598400,,529,4.888888888888889

I liked Katy's music, but I wasn't a hardcore fan or anything.  The movie just flew by and I found myself liking Katy as a person more and more.  She comes off as such a genuine person and I was almost in tears when she had to go onstage right after she found out Russell wanted a divorce.  The movie does interviews with friends, family, and her business people.  It also shows a lot of behind the scenes footage.  Russell is featured somewhat in the movie, but Katy comes off as so caring and devoted (she took constant red-eye flights to go see him in the middle of tour) and Russell just comes off as a selfish jerk.",1378512000,,749,4.23943661971831

This movie introduces you to Katy Perry's personality on and off stage, her dedication to her fans as well as her rise to stardom.

This movie was an inspiration, a message of never giving up on your dreams and always remaining true to yourself. Katy remained true to herself, despite the rejections, and it paid off in the end. I cried as I watched her heartbreak. To allow the cameras to film her, especially in her most vulnerable moments, took a lot of courage. My favorite part was watching her interaction with her fans and with her co-workers. She treated everyone like a friend. This young lady is quite admirable, showing what it is to rise to the top, but remembering where she came from and how she got there. Her professionalism in the face of her own personal troubles showed her strength of character and her dedication to her career and her fans. Truly inspirational.",1376179200,,887,4.620253164556962

Sometime projecting that everthing is good can get you thru it. She never let the fans down. Her ssongs are very real you just have to listen.

This is not the story about some washed up, drug addled rock star that's full of drama but more about a girl's struggle to make it into the music business and a look into her rise to fame. Katy seems like a genuine entertainer who keeps herself grounded by staying connected to her family, friends, and fans. She loves what she does and isn't afraid to be herself. She brings fun everywhere she goes. If she keeps doing and stays humble and grounded throughout her career, she'll be around for many years to come.

I'm in my late twenties and usually listen to Katy Perry as a guilty pleasure or for workouts.  I wouldn't say I was a die hard fan or anything close to that, BUT this was one of the best artist on the road documentaries I've seen.  It left me a bit emotional, really liking her, and overall inspired.  Other than the part where her ex decides to dump her during tour it was a happy movie.",1373673600,,478,4.163043478260869

Throughout the tour we were blessed with different original videos of her, seeing how she felt about her music, her parents, from her teens to signing of all her record deals. It also depicted how touring for the fans does take a toll on a singers personal life and her body. If anyone is interested in a girls personal aspect of how a record artist has to promote their wares, this was a very good account.",1372723200,,573,4.415094339622642

I view her in such a different light now. She really worked hard for what she has now and she deserves everything she has. It shows how good a person and artist Katy is. I mean she sucked up her feelings and performed even when she was depressed. That shows pure courage to show her emotions to her fans. And it shows how much she cares for them, because she didn't have to go on stage when she was crying but she did. She is such an inspiration and this movie changed the way I think about her!",1372636800,,650,4.208

I loved it.  It put a lot of that time frame into perspective for me watching Katy struggle with her relationship with her then-husband, the fans, her family, the difficulties and pressures she went through to get to where she is now.  I say I'm a fan now more than I liked her then because she seems far more real and human from seeing this movie.  She's human.  She's touchable.  And she's just as real as anyone else is.

Fantastic with great music, cut scenes from her concerts (which I totally have to take my girls to), and behind-the-scene moments that really make you pay attention, this movie was filled with great moments, sad moments and was very well done.",1370563200,,881,4.490566037735849

She is a strong family person despite her rebellion from the religious radicalism her grew up with. She is a humanitarian. Most impressive in the whole set is her openness about the breakup of her marriage and the courageous way she handled it while on tour. I am a baby boomer, a classic rock fan AND a big fan of the very talented Katy Perry.",1367625600,,472,4.436781609195402

5162035,3,B008H5J510,"I love Katy Perry, and her music.  This was a interesting look behind the scenes of a grueling tour and public life.  It was clear from the clips of them, that her marriage to Russell Brand was a train wreck - he appears so immature and she seems to be in a make-believe fantasy relationship.

I was glad to see her leave him but, her latest love interest - Mayer - is no better.  He will use her and move on to the next pretty young woman that smiles at him.",1364515200,,459,4.010989010989011

It's not often we get such an insiders look into the lives of celebrities, but you sure do in this. I have to admit that it was absolutely heart breaking to watch her marriage crumble, and her crumble with it.

Though its a bit too much documentary and not enough concert, it gives a real look into one of pop musics more interesting stories.

Glad to have this in my collection.",1352073600,,362,4.5
5162147,3,B008H5J510,"Certainly part of the charm of this documentary is the personality and charisma of Katy Perry herself.  Some will be disappointed to find out that this is not a concert film, although there are significant clips taken from various venues during her 2011 world tour.

What we see primarily is a lot of backstage activity and show preparation interspersed with short interview clips from those closest to her.  While certainly the film has the self-promotion feel, it doesn't duck the trials and tribulations of being a star.  The interviews do not include any with Russell Brand, but we do get to see Perry's reaction to their final breakup.  It isn't pretty and yes the show must go on.

There isn't a heavy dose of Perry's early life, although there is a smattering of clips of her as a teenager performing mostly religious songs.  Perhaps most surprising is that she was able to extricate herself from the cultural isolation imposed by her travelling preacher parents.  Even if you aren't a big fan, you won't be bored.  Still this is a film aimed at Katy Perry's target audience and I suspect they will enjoy it.

I watched this on the 2-D Blu ray but there is a 3-D version as well.  The video comes with 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The video quality varies somewhat, primarily because of a variety of original material.  The concert footage is first rate, complete with colorful razzle-dazzle like Perry herself.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is first rate as you might expect.  Plenty of surround and excellent bass for your subs.  Here is a list of extras:

""Last Friday Night"" Full Concert Performance
""Waking Up in Vegas"" Full Concert Performance
Grandma: An extended scene of Katy with her grandmother.
The Grammy's You'll Never Take Away From Me: Grammy preparation.
California Dreams Tour: Behind the Scenes (1080p): A six-part feature.

But I was surprised by what a hit it was with her brother(s), and continue to be amused everytime we catch them rockin' out to the movie. Understand that Katie Perry, while fun and catchy, does have some risque lyrics that may catch you off-guard to hear coming out of your child's mouth (and, no, I'm not talking about ""I kissed a girl"" which I find tame and funny -- Peacock anyone?). And, as a parent, I support any message where hard work and preserveance makes things possible.

5162171,5,B008H5J510,"If you're like me you have probably dreamed of meeting the public person who most inspires your life many times. Maybe it will happen for you as it happens for some fans backstage on Part of Me.

The next best thing would  be going to the concert and hoping that one day, maybe.. you could be one of the lucky few who make it all the way backstage and meet your inspiration, or would you meet them randomly somewhere? It happens.

Here then is a rare opportunity to do something similar, experience Katy Perry in concert, get a backstage pass and a fly on the wall behind the scenes look at the California Dreams tour.

I will be the first to admit that I am not Katy Perry's number one fan. I don't own any of her albums, but I do respect her accomplishments, her mighty alabaster orbs, her charisma and presence and the fact that she did manage to get five number ones singles off her Teenage Dreams album.

In so doing she matched an accomplishment only ever achieved by Michael Jackson for Bad.

Her number one Billboard singles were: Last Friday Night (TGIF), California Gurls (featuring Snoop Dogg), the anthemic Firework, E.T (featuring Kanye West) and Teenage Dream.

As a writer I loved her use her use of alliteration on songs such as Hummingbird Heartbeat, and cherry chapstick on I Kissed a Girl.

Part of me is combination biography, concert tour, real life drama. I loved watching the performances and I think she is a tremendous songwriter with one of the best voices in the business.

The bio part shows that overnight success only came after years of hard work, struggle and rejection. It's an inspiring story about persisting against the odds.

Although she was going through some tough personal stuff in her life during this tour particularly with the end of the marriage with Russell Brand I found this gave an emotional wallop to the movie. At one point before the concert in Rio she sobs uncontrollably in her dressing room. Her staff wonders if she can perform at all.

Then she calls for her makeup artist. On her way to the stage she breaks down again her body racked with sobs. Then she gets on the elevator to the stage, she turns on her lollipops and we see a change in her facial expression as her game face comes on. It's a wonder to behold. What a trouper.

Then the fans sing 'we love you Katy' in Portuguese almost as if they sense her struggle and lift her up. These were some of the greatest moments I will experience at any movie this year. The concert scenes I found to be visually spectacular down to the smallest detail with vibrant colors and a dizzying array of colorful costumes that dutifully and beautifully highlight her voluptuous figure.

I commend her for letting us get so close and sharing something so deeply personal even though she was hurting at the time. In so doing she has fashioned a remarkable movie.

I loved this movie and highly recommend it even if you are not a huge fan but just love great performance and I hope you found this helpful.",1350259200,4,3001,4.533333333333333

It was entertaining; I enjoyed the coverage of the live performances from her California Dreams tour.  It shows how hard Katy Perry worked to become a star and how hard she must continue to work to realize her dream.  She is family oriented.  The relationship between her and Russell Brand wasn't showcased but had a steady thread throughout the video.  Both my daughter and I enjoyed the film.  I do not regret the purchase.

It's all centered around one person, whose lyrics have very little depth, randomness, or awareness of the complex world.  I admit some of her melodies are catchy, but they're all spoiled by a vocal or drum that pierces the other sounds.

I liked the movie but so glad I didn't go see it at the movie theater.  I hope it made Katy lots of money but I doubt it made a lot of money at the box office.  I wasn't expecting a documentary but it lacked substance.  It does tell you that being a rock/pop star isn't an easy lifestyle and it will take a toll on your love life.  If your partner isn't with you, even if you BOTH have money, then your relationship will suffer.  It did for Katy and Russell but I didn't see that one lasting in the first place.

5162188,4,B008H5J510,"You are invited to join Katy Perry on the 'California Dreams' World Tour, in this story based and musically infused documentary/drama directed by Dan Cutforth. Perry is lifted straight up onto the stage and begins to command the audience. Kinda like an explosion, kinda like a cartoon playing out, kinda like a bunch of kids in a candy store and totally like Katy Perry.

Because this is in the form of a semi-documentary I took a chance on this one.  Instead of a concert I found a spectacle: of lighting, of color, of the costumes and a total cast of characters together for this event. Although, most of all I got to know a hardworking  woman who states of herself, ""I feel a real connection to Fairy Tales"" and ""I just wanna be the first Katy Perry!"".

From where Perry is today, one of the most colorful young women out there who dares to be different, it's a far reach to see how she arrived at the top.

Being brought up in a strict Pentecostal family and having a father who is a preacher, she began singing at a very young age.  Katy was given a guitar of her own at thirteen and started writing her own music.

Katy had a dream for herself from the tender age of three; to be in glitter with everyone watching her.  Now with that dream fulfilled, she wants to ""give people a heart full of happiness and a dream for a lifetime"".  She teamed with manager Bradford Cobb and shot off like a rocket with her first charting hit.

In no way has her path been easy.  Her determination, focus and drive got her right to where she is now, while taking some curves along the way.  One in the direction of marriage to Russell Brand (""Get Him to the Greek"").  They fell in love deeply and quickly, as Katy states;  ""I honestly thought I had found the love of my life"".

As Katy is performing show after show all over the world, she is also jetting back home routinely to be with Brand.  Her grueling pace takes a toll on her happy life; although Brand signed-on at the outset with full knowledge of her record and upcoming tour. He files for a divorce from a devastated Perry, who is broken down and in tears behind a packed stadium of her fans awaiting her.

While this is the stuff that may flatten a woman, Katy gets up and comes straight out onstage again.  She adores her fans as much as they do her and they feed off each others strengths in a magnetic cyclical motion.  Katy Perry is all about happiness, color and light, giving it to her fans at all costs.",1348876800,7,2461,4.32244008714597

The video is top notch and so is the audio.  Crank it UP!

What makes this movie especially enjoyable is that I saw KP on this tour in Columbia, MD with my wife and daughter.

Katy has a strong support network of family and friends, and she will find the right man when the time comes. There is plenty of time for a family in 10+ years from now.

However, Katy, I do think you are mature enough to handle being a mother. Putting this off until you have the time to be a mother is very wise. ROCK ON.

Good Luck Katy (K Hudson)",1348358400,,707,4.192592592592592

My kids and I rented this movie at their request and I went in with low expectations. Surprisingly, I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. I felt it had the right balance of concert footage, behind the scenes footage, and backstory. Katy comes across as honest, real, and driven by a desire to truly make others smile. Her journey through the music industry was inspiring, and the concert footage was loads of fun. The bits on her failing marriage with Russell Brand was just enough to keep it real without indulging in any bashing. I feel the film is innocent enough for younger girls (mine are 8 and 6) but of course that's up to parents - there are a few swear words, and footage of 'I Kissed a Girl', but no wild partying or anything like that. Katy actually comes across as working more than anything else. Her idea of a good time is taking the crew to an amusement park on their day off. So mostly, this was good, clean fun.",1348358400,,1020,4.459893048128342
5162197,2,B008H5J510,"Believe it or not, I'm a Katy Perry fan, but not nearly enough to see this in theaters. This is pretty dull with a lot of home movie, some concert footage and behind the scenes. It documents her year long tour... but doesn't have full song performances. It shows the behind the scenes and even brief moments of her new ex husband. But sprinkled in there is the real biography of this documentary / film. It shows her growing up, where she came from, her budding music career, why she's so awesome and would make it big one day.

Personally, this was a chore for 2 Katy Perry fans to get through. I think a concert DVD would have been better, but perhaps there are mega Katy fans that will think this is the best movie ever because it brings you into Katy Perry's life and how she's always been fun and weird from the start.

It is more than a biography, but it is still a biography with concert footage and behind the scenes. If you like watching home movies about someone you idolize, this is for you. If not, skip it, because you'll be bored. I can think of something 1,000x more entertaining... listening to one of Katy's 2 CDs. They're amazingly better than this.",1348358400,2,1167,4.373271889400922
5162198,2,B008H5J510,"UPDATE:
Disk 2 was supposed to contain all of the special features, but there wasn't any extra content that I could find on any of the disks, so I am returning my copy for a refund.
------------
I knew this was going to be very ""autobiographical"", but from how it was advertised, I expected it to be as much about the concert experience as it was the behind the scenes story.  This movie however, is a 93 minute VH1 documentary with very little actual concert footage.  Where there is concert footage, it is interrupted by interviews.  Only toward the end are there a couple of songs which were played in their entirety.  I haven't watched any of the extras, so this review is just based on the movie itself.  I'll update my review after I watch the other disks.

From what I was able to tell, most of the movie was shot in 2D with a few 3D embellishments.  The concert footage was shot in 3D and looked good, but this was hardly what I would call (or would have paid for had I known) a 3D movie.

The movie was kind of an interesting insight into Katy Perry's life, but I walked away from it liking her less.  As written in other reviews, she comes across as stiff and fake as her candy colored costumes and props.  She is supposed to be some sort of role model, but for what, I don't know.  She is a natural beauty who hides behind a phony persona, not exactly role model material.  Her music might have been from the heart at one point, but by the end of the movie, she seems to have become the formulaic act she was fighting against at the beginning.  Granted, it is her formula...or is it?  You decide.

Not worth the purchase price (especially for the 3D content) unless you're a die hard KP fan, but probably worth renting.",1348185600,3,1730,4.312693498452012

5162203,5,B008H5J510,"My wife would not let our 10 Yr Old grandaughter see the movie,  because of some discussion she saw on the View.  I am hardly a Katy Perry fan,  but read the other reviews and decided to see for myself.  The only negative I could come up with was that the "" music "" was secondary to the ""story line"" which went into her background and events leading up to her becoming a Pop Superstar. They also added in her marriage and divorce from Russel Brand.

Not one of her songs was performed from beginning to end and the sound quality was sub standard. I can't help but contrast this movie with the Glee Concert Movie, where the sound and performances were far superior in presentation.

All of that being said,  I was impressed by this young woman,  her perserverance and talent.  For those biddies on the View who apparently critized her costumes;
I would suggest that they remember that she is a "" Pop Music ""  star.  Pop Music is filled with Elton John,  Madonna,  Lady Gaga and Michael Jackson types.  In comparision  Katy Perry is a pillar of sanity.",1348012800,5,1050,4.424083769633508

On top of it all, she has a good, strong voice, and amazing camera presence.  Her videos are first class.  I thought her ""Teenage Dream"" video was very moving.",1348012800,2,310,4.5636363636363635

This is an honest documentary about herself, and I must say, she bares it all to the fans.  I was surprised about her parents.  Won't tell what happens, but I must say, in my opinion, they're strange, thus Katy's personality.  The editing was nicely done. Nice music clips.  Still not a fan, but I do like an interesting story.",1347926400,5,416,4.35064935064935

It opens and closes with video messages that fans had recorded of how much Katy has inspired them. Her history and the behind-the-stage/in-between-show scenes give you a feel/respect for the person that is Katy Perry as well as the performer on stage. I wholy recommend this movie for any young person with a dream or, heck, anyone who just enjoys her music occasionally. (Spoiler Alert: keep tissues handy)",1347926400,2,582,4.83

5162210,5,B008H5J510,"I went to see ""Katy Perry: Part Of Me"" at my local theater on July 9, 2012; 5 days after it was first released; and again in 3D format on July 18th with a close friend of mine. I knew when I went to see it that it was NOT going to be boring; even just the name Katy Perry is enough to take the dull out of my day. I've been a fan since ""California Gurls"" in 2010. The stuff from ""One Of The Boys"" I liked a little later on. What I didn't expect however was how much this film made me love her and her work A LOT more than I did before. There were A LOT of scenes and songs that touched my heart in ways I never expected. One scene was one of her meet and greets where she asks people if they want to dance on stage with her that coincided with her performance of Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"". If you liked it on Katy's ""California Dreams"" tour, you'll love it here too.
Another was what I call the ""Hey Jude"" scene, when Katy talked about how she handled her divorce from Russell Brand. I can't remember exactly what she said, although I knew what the subject matter was. COME ON! It's been 2 months since I last saw it. A piano version of ""Hey Jude"" played in the background during her interview. Then came the cruncher; her MusicCares rehearsal of that same song. That made my heart go ""KNOCK ME OUT! KNOCK ME OUT!!""
All in all, I knew I was gonna see something truly cool, but I never thought it would be THIS cool! Maybe it's just me. I hope not!",1347753600,15,1469,4.034246575342466
5162211,1,B008H5J510,"This movie definitely depicts the life of Katy Perry and her rising fame with fun clips and cool scenes but fails to deliver a real meaning and glorious emotional feel. It's like your watching a movie for little kids except it's about a 28 year old woman singing about ""Peacocks"" and her ""Teenage Dreams"". Music/Tour documentaries are for Justin Bieber not Katy Perry. Can't stand this movie can't stand her. Not to mention that this movie failed to do good in any countries, but too bad for her. Seems her stunt to gain in cash didn't work because her fan base isn't big enough for that. As far as my personal opinion of Katy I think she is a cool and fun WOMAN, but is way too cheery, sweet, and bubble gum pop. Her music feels so fake, and her vocal talent and Musical talent isn't necessarily the best. She did not help produce, direct, or manage anything for this movie, which really shows the work she put in? RIGHT? She has done good for her self, but I feel when her next album comes out she won't be so happy? Perfume?Movie?ReRelease?Soda?Chips?VideoGames? It seems shell do anything to be in the spotlight but lacks that mature and true feeling to her. She does not have the presence of a legend but just another singer, a bad one that is.
Sorry for all my blabbering, I know this is a review of her movie not herself but I feel I need to include it as well so yes that's it!

Its one of the few times you don't have to take everything so seriously and just be SILLY!

That being said, this movie made me cry, laugh, sing and feel what Ms Perry felt in her heartbreaks. She shows what acceptance and determination really can accomplish in a very open and honest way.

I left that movie not only with a whole new respect for her as an artist and role model but it made me proud to be a woman/mother showing my daughter that it really does pay off to be yourself no matter WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU!!

5162214,5,B008H5J510,"Okay, I'm a huge Katy Perry fan. I think her songs are pretty amazing, and she has the image of what a popstar should be, not really crazy like Gaga or Minaj, just a singer without the craziness. I also went to her concert last year, but thanks to this film, most of the fans get to know the real Katy Perry. Not the one we know from the music, or the one we see on interviews.
Following her life on the California Dreams Tour 2011, in this film we get to know Katy's origins, her life while touring and the struggles she has. Perry shows not only the great side of being famous, but also the bad one that includes pressure, fatigue and the obligation she has to put a smile every night in a concert even if she's broken on the inside. This film is only for fans and for non-judgemental people, honestly if you are not a KatyCat, you won't enjoy this movie. It's made for fans.
I think the 3D wasn't really needed. The movie only has like three or four 3D effects, but it was also a great addition to make the film more appealing to fans. If you haven't seen it yet, go and give it a try. If you're a KatyCat like me, you'll love her even more and if you don't, you'll probably become a fan after watching this.",1344470400,2,1211,4.113924050632911

5162216,5,B008H5J510,"I took a few weeks to mull over whether this was worth my time, and whether to take my daughter to it.  Katy has a great voice, but some of her songs and lifestyle do not jive with our standards.

I bit the bullet and took my daughter, thinking this would be a great ""teaching"" moment to show how someone who has made it big, and someone she may look up to.  I was thinking that we could talk about the decisions Katy made in her life, those that were good and those that were poor decisions.

Rather than glorify Katy and every decision she made, it appeared to be an honest effort to document her journey.  I learned some positive qualities of her that I was not aware of, and the questionable lyrics were not on center stage in the movie.

The music is awesome.  It was a fun movie.  The underlying theme is to be strong and independent, that not fitting in with the crowd is OK.  And that is important because young people face that across the entire spectrum, from not being the ""popular ones"" to just trying to fit in with the average joe.

I recommend the movie.",1343692800,,1069,4.247524752475248
5162217,5,B008H5J510,"Even though I love Katy Perry's music, I didn't expect to love her movie.  There's a big difference between enjoying a five minute song and watching a two-hour movie.  I only saw the movie because my two daughters wanted to see it.

As it turns out, I really loved the movie.  Viewers get a unique glimpse not only into Katy's current pop star lifestyle and concert tour madness, but also into her struggle to get a music label in the first place as well as her efforts to hold together a failing marriage.

But the reason I really ended up loving this movie is because Katy the person (not Katy the pop star) really appears to be genuinely sweet and likeable.  I loved seeing her interact with her siblings, her friends, her fans, her evangelist parents, and even her adorable grandmother.  Katy's ""realness"" really touched my heart . . . and even watered my eyes more than once.

5162219,4,B008H5J510,"""Katy Perry Part of Me"" is a rare and unique glimpse into the life, childhood, upbringing, ups and down and tag along journey for the concert tour of a lifetime for Katy Perry. In the capable hands of producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, this isn't just your ordinary run-of-the-mill documentary/concert video, this is a story and a behind the scenes insight like I've never seen before.

A few things grabbed me as the movie starts with the preparation of her monster first world tour. They start with the setup for her first concert and her associating with her crew, dancers and staff before going into the opening number. She treats the people around her like gold. The people she hires to do her costumes, makeup, manage her schedule and organize her life aren't industry people. They are her friends. They were ordinary, run-of-the-mill people who Katy worked with when she was a nobody and she kept them. She loves them, and they love her and that is the nuts and bolts of ""Part of Me"".

Katy Perry may consider herself the `Pied Piper of Weirdness', but I would consider her the `Pied Piper of Genuineness'. It is the heart of her success, because it is exactly what took her, after years of struggle, out from under record labels that told her who she ""should"" be. Millions of fans, literally overnight, took to her personality of being exactly who she is and fell in love with her. She is the voice of this generation. I don't doubt that. We live in a time where traditions and expectations are blending with freedom of expression and freedom of genuineness.  Katy Perry quite simply stands for being proud of who you are and being loud and proud about it. This very thing has made her a mega star.

In the Summer of 2011, Katy Perry did what only one artist had ever done before. She had 5 number one hits from one album. Only Michael Jackson had ever done that before. She did this by not being Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson or who ever else she was told to be like, she did this by being herself and with ""Part of Me"" you find out, that herself is something good and decent. Until her late teens, she was raised in a strict religious household. Even though she broke from that mold and had to pursue a path apart from her parents, she still finishes her shows looking to the sky and saying, ""Thank you God.""

Sure, some of what she brings to the stage is like Willy Wonka meets Wizard of Oz but the essence of genuineness that she embodies is no different back stage, with fans or on stage. She is always exactly who she says she is. Although as the toll of the tour begins to mount with personal heartbreaks, we see how she has established a persona with her fans and despite hardships, they come to expect it and she must deliver.

""Katy Perry Part of Me"" is not just a concert/behind the scenes video. It goes into the heart of an extremely genuine overnight sensation that is tackling life, just like all of us. The best movies are the ones you walk out of still thinking about, wanting to talk about and maybe even discovering a life lesson or two. ""Part of Me"" is one of those movies. You come out of that movie feeling a genuine kinship with a celebrity who can never be described as `typical'. There was a joy in her eyes and smile throughout most of the movie, but toward the end some of that was gone and you want to console her like a friend. That's just the way she makes you feel, like everybody else she comes in contact with.",1342137600,39,3472,4.42566510172144
5162220,5,B008H5J510,"Saw the movie as a favor for my 12 year old, but found myself being drawn into the singer's work ethic and personal life challenges. Realizing it is also a promotional tool, I have to admit I would rather pay for us to see this movie in 3D, than to buy expensive, bad concert tickets in a huge arena. Up close footage from the concert via 3D movie beats standing way back in the cheap seats, and seeing a disappointed daughter because she can't see what's going on on stage. The movie portrays a strong work ethic and a strong, individualistic female role model for young ladies.",1341878400,3,579,4.420560747663552
