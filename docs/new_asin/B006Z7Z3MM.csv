Some of it was filmed on land/in vehicles and other parts were from plane (and I assume other shots were from a drone).  It was lightly informative giving a few facts here and there about the locations, hotels, animals, and local culture.  In case anyone is wondering this is a movie is NOT a hunting safari (was slightly worried it might be since it wasn't stated when I bought it but was happy to find out there was no hunting).  I felt that some shots were less than blu-ray quality but kinda expected that since it wasn't filmed by a whole movie team.",1520294400,,633,4.431034482758621
8506798,5,B006Z7Z3MM,"I was skeptical because I feared this was a ""home movie.""  I found the movie to be informative and the photography was beautiful.  It is a far cry from a touristy travel video but every bit as satisfying.",1501113600,,204,4.342105263157895

8506803,4,B006Z7Z3MM,This is perfect it you are going to east Africa. Lots of specifics on hotels and seasons and places to see different animals. It is not a collection of awesome game shots showing what a fine photographer to author is. This is for people who want to be good photographers and enjoy game watching. Fits me to a tee.,1397433600,,313,4.322033898305085
