7775976,5,B01H2OWNH4,"If you enjoyed The Bridge, you definately want to see part 2. I bought it not realizing part 2 would be on the cd.  This is probably my favorite Christmas movie now. I am a man and I found myself crying at the end. I rarely cry. You definitely need to check this out. I agree with the previous reviewer, i would love a not movie with the same character",1473120000,17,352,4.0285714285714285
7775977,5,B01H2OWNH4,"What could be better for a book nerd than a movie about a bookstore?

When I heard that the Hallmark Channel was going to turn Karen Kingsburys The Bridge into a movie Ill admit I wasn't over the top excited. I wasn't a fan of the book upon first reading it (Ive since re-read the book and enjoyed it much more the 2nd time). However, when the movie premiered I absolutely LOVED it!! Starring Ted McGinley (Charlie), Faith Ford (Donna), Wyatt Nash (Ryan), and Katie Findlay (Molly), the casting was perfect in my opinion. Each character did a superb job of bringing these characters to life. I was invested in each character and their story. I might even have shed a tear or two  The movie gave me the more in-depth feel I was looking for with Molly and Ryan that I felt was missing from the book. Gosh, I had butterflies watching some of their scenes.

My friend Angela said this about Part 1 
The Bridge reminds me of Helen Kellers red-letter days, when we meet someone who changes us, who swoops in magically and influences our direction. I identify with Molly and Ry, feeling wistful gratitude for having met those special people, though I may never see them again.

For a little fun while you're watching Part 1 look for cameos by Karen, her son Ty and several of her books.

I LOVED Part 2 as much as Part 1 but I found Part 2 more emotional. I spent the entire 2 hours choked up and trying not to sob. Im such a sap  The Bridge was a fantastic portrayal of a community coming together to help others in need. I don't want to spoil it for anyone that has not seen the movie or read the book but I was pleased with how the movie ended. It left me wanting more  in a good way.

How does the movie compare to the books? Having recently re-read the book (dont forget its prequel, The Beginning), it is pretty fresh in my mind. There are some slight changes but the movie sticks very closely to the story Karen originally told in her book.

The Bridge Parts 1 and 2 are the conclusion of Karens book but I would love to see more from Ryan, Molly, Charlie and Donna.

7775979,5,B01H2OWNH4,"Hallo

The dvd ""THE BRIDGE"" is excellent.  Loved all of it.
Thank you

""TADPOLE AND THE WHALE""  I  LOVE the movie

BUT:

1. It was advertised as a dvd, and a video tape was send.

2. It didn't arrive on the time I asked for it, nearly 2 months later, and I had to pay an enormous amount to get it ""early"".

3. The tape is from beginning to the end damaged, I believe because of all the scanning at the airports.

7776035,3,B01H2OWNH4,"Wow did I see the same movie that everyone else did? Sorry, but this does not deserve 5 stars. I expected this grand dramatic film considering it was in two parts, and what I got, was just your run-of-the-mill Hallmark Movie. Very typical storyline of shop owners who run into financial trouble. Then your protagonists figure out of way, along with the community to keep the shop going. The element of how The Bridge brought people together and enriched their lives fell flat for me with not enough emphasis. Then this movie was so drawn out, that after a quarter of the way through, I found myself saying, Okay, so where is this going? Wheres the meat to the storyline? Finally, towards the end of the first movie it picks up a bit, only to end abruptly where you have to watch the second part to get any kind of satisfaction. Also, the putting together and tearing apart of Ryan and Molly was fine, but this misconception of what they both wanted and the barely missing each other scenes drew weary after a while. To the point that when they finally got together, it was anti-climactic. It was too drawn out where they could have easily edited this down to a single 2hr movie with no problem. The Bridge is okay for what it is, and what it is, is just your typical Hallmark movienothing special.",1492992000,,1297,4.5

7776040,5,B01H2OWNH4,"The Tunnel, is a riff from The Bridge in both Scandanavian and English versions. Truth be told I like The Tunnel better. The Bridge was the forerunner, and brought the interacting of two separate police departments working together. In all three versions the separate detectives are wary of one another, each having their own personality and their own method of police work. But when they work together, like a marriage, the work is better.

The Tunnel brings Karl, a Brit played by Stephen Dillane. He is on his third marriage, after cheating on each wife, has 5 children by different women, is looking for fun and love to ease the stress of his job. But in reality his life has been his job until he comes face to face with losing his family. The French side of the connection, Elise, is played by Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy. She is blunt, an attractive blonde, has no social graces, but is brilliant at her job. They are both involved in looking for a serial killer who has left the top half of a British body connected to the bottom half of a French body, placed smack dab in the middle of The Chunnel, the underwater tunnel that connects France and England. This is the beginning of a long stretch to find the killer known as Truth Terrorist.

We meet many characters, and as the days drag on the media, teens, old military, pensioners, financial people and the police are all a part of the circle of deaths. The writing is terrific, the acting is better, the scenes between France and England gorgeous. The Tunnel all boils down to the two detectives, their relationships with others and between themselves. High tension ensues, trying to outwit the Truth Terrorist, and bring him to justice without too many bodies along the way. Loved the two main characters, and their relationship. Looking forward to Part III.

Very heart-warming tale about how you can touch people's lives in positive ways without ever realizing it.  It's also about learning to love someone enough to give them the freedom to be themselves. Very heart-warming, but not sappy.  It's about community and coming together to help someone in need.  You come away with lessons learned.",1482019200,3,460,4.62962962962963

7776122,5,B01H2OWNH4,"If you'd ever read a Karen Kingsbury novel, then you suspect you're in for some weepy ish with any movie that adapts her work. The Bridge is such, and it is an absorbing viewing, never mind that it's told in two parts that aired months apart on the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries channel - Part One on December 6, 2015, Part Two on March 20, 2016. And if you eyeballed the original broadcasts, then you may have been as aggravated as I was at the interminable wait in between. And, yet, ultimately, it was worth it, wasn't it? I found the second part to be the richer half and the more rewarding half. Maybe the most telling thing is that The Bridge makes an argument for the tactile merit of the physical page versus its more detached digital counterpart, the e-read. It emphasizes the personal connections made in spending time in a cozy book store in the company of like-minded people and thumbing thru ""real books with actual paper,"" to quote Charlie Barton (Ted McGinley). Charlie is the kindhearted proprietor of The Bridge, a much loved two-storied book store in Franklin, Tennessee.

It's a story that spans seven years, and, so, the sweeping element of it. The cast rivets you to your seat. The four core actors are marvelous, although, to me, the easy standout is Katie Findlay as wilful Molly Callens. There's something about Katie; is it her smile, her expressive eyes, or the way she projects equal parts determination and vulnerability? It's about a tragedy inspiring a couple to found a book store designed expressly to be a home away from home for their patrons, and, years later, it's about an epic leak on the roof. And it's about two college students who meet in Franklin on the onset of their freshmen year and how they fall for each other but drift apart, only to run into each other years later. And, yeah, since this is a Hallmark movie, it's about a dire need for an eleventh hour Christmas miracle.

It's a two-part mini-series that's best appreciated when watched back to back. Like I said, Part One, when it originally aired, understandably cheesed off a gang of viewers (including me!) because you get to the end of that one and you're met with that ""to be continued"" blurb and then come to find Part Two wouldn't air until months later. #FrustrationIsReal. Now, whenever Hallmark re-airs it, it's shown one directly after the other. It's a fantastic little mini-series. Tugs the heart. Hits those emotional beats. Invests you. Rewards you with wonderful emotional payoffs. Makes you wish people were this good and caring. And, oboy, Katie Findlay weeping is an invitation for you to tear up, as well. If there's a flaw, it's that the ""big bad"" of the story is pretty cartoony in his despicability. And, yet, because this is Hallmark, even that meddling fink comes around. Yeah, it's a bit jarring that Part Two aired in March because this is such a Christmasy movie, but never mind, never mind. I wish with fervency for a local book store as cozy and inviting and down-homey as The Bridge. I wish for people like the book store owners, the Bartons, to greet me with open arms and with a tray of snacks. I wish what happened to Molly and Ryan would happen to me, only absent of the seven year wait. For now, I guess I'll settle for watching this mini-series or settle for reading the book. Where's my Kindle PaperWhite? Just kidding.",1481673600,,3358,4.651515151515151

While I wouldn't call them ""Classics"", I do think they are decent and likable. There were a couple of characters I didn't care for, but the bookshop is a charming place that I think anyone who watches these will wish they had a place like it in their lives. They are mostly child appropriate with only one or 2 scary situations(car crash, hospital). I'm not sure if anyone under 12 would be interested though.",1480896000,,512,4.7

7776186,5,B01H2OWNH4,"The Bridge is one of my favorite movies. However, the DVD did not allow me to play Part 2 on my DVD player. I had to play Part 2 on a little portable DVD player.  This makes me question the quality of the DVD. In this sense, it is a disappointment, not the movie itself, just the DVD. Is there any chance you would replace it?.",1475452800,,327,3.9545454545454546

7776207,5,B01H2OWNH4,"The Bridge is an adaptation of Karen Kingsburys novel of the same name. It is actually a two-part single story, but each part is an 86 minute feature-length TV film, thus the box calls this 2 movies. Not exactly. Part one you primarily meet the cast and their characters and get involved in their daily lives, all good, but almost all have a back issues they struggle with. Episode one opens in NC in 1997 when Donna (Faith Ford queen of chirpy & perky) miscarries and she and her hubby, Charlie Barton (Ted McGinley) move on to make a new life in Franklin via their bookstore The Bridge which Charlie suggests is their family they cant have as biological parents. It works. Flash forward to near Christmas 2009. Lives are touched at The Bridge, including local Belmont Uni freshmen Ryan Kelly (Wyatt Nash) and Molly Callen (Katie Findlay).

Episode Two moves forward in time another 7 years to 2016 Christmas and Ill not tell what, but the Bartons have had disaster placed upon a disaster. He holds to his faith, she, who lives for her husband and the bookstore, gives up. They find, as individuals life-paths are revealed, that The Bridge truly has given them a family who offer a hand, offer support, prayers.
The Bridge is old-school, traditional lifestyle storytelling about people with some serious bumps in the road. And, of course, its about books, real books, and the brick-&-mortar bookshop struggle. It is as holiday sweet a story as caramel-coated pecans dipped in milk chocolate. Or a mega muffin topped with a giant swirl of cream-cheese icing sprinkled with sugar/cinnamon, and a gooey inner-muffin cream.
A story with multiple themes of hope, faith, heart, perseverance, and loves.
It may seem corny in todays movies glut of murder, monsters, & super heroes, but expect goosebumps before The Bridge is completed.
I did.
Closed Captioned.
And for readers, Ive read the book, and it is even better than the film adaptation. Video can never put all of one books story on film unless it is done in a lengthy mini-series. Book and/or DVD is sure to turn your Seasons Greetings into the old traditional Merry Christmas.
