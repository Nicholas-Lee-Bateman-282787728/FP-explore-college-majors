8343777,5,B001UHW2J4,"A bit on the slow side (this is not a Hollywood production, after all) & some of the acting is, well, you know (B movie). But the mystery keeps you going & Adam Baldwin does an amazing job of playing a homeless person. And it poignantly answers the question: How did he GET that way?",1315872000,2,283,4.163636363636364
8343778,5,B001UHW2J4,"I bought this movie for two reasons: Adam Baldwin had the title role, and the plot description was intriguing. The story is gripping and the characters draw you in from the beginning. Adam Baldwin fans who know him mostly from ""Chuck"" and the ""Firefly""/""Serenity"" franchises will see just how phenomenal his dramatic skills are. (Mr. Baldwin's work in ""Chuck v. the Tic Tac"" cannot hold a candle to the work he does as ""the Keyman."")  There are some comedic moments in this movie, but it is a compelling drama, first and foremost. Daniel Millican did a superb job leading this production. If you are a fan of Adam Baldwin, or a fan of movies with a message, this is a movie you want to purchase.",1292630400,7,695,4.56
