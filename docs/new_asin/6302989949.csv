The disc transfer is horrible...but it was origionally a tv movie and I doubt the origional transfer was kept in good condition.  It's fun to see some of the ""Charlie's Angels"" before they were the Angels!!!  And Pamala Franklin is always a hoot to watch.  There are some nice atmospheric scenes that do remind you that you are watching a ""horror"" film.

531294,4,6302989949,"Look, it is low budget and kinda silly, but I would buy this DVD before I would buy Cold Creek Manor, The Missing, High Tension and The Village.

This movie is fun too watch and the Devil in those white shoes and flare (not bell bottoms) leg slacks are worth the price of this film.  And Kate Jackson must be at least 6'2"" which is a plus for me in itself.

A girl speeding down the road in a Duster, scared to death of something makes it to her sister's house, only to die inside.  The investigation closed by the police as suicide; the dead girl's sister embarkes on a mission to find out what really happpend to her late sister.  Her investigation leads her to the all girls academy her sister was attending.  Lots of night scenes and a basement scene which is a plus.  And a few possible candidates for the proverbial bad guy.  To top it off a good solid ending.  This movie comes from a time where movies were really fun to watch.  This movie is right out of the late show era before the days of infomercials when you could get some snacks and cuddle up on the couch and just enjoy a silly film that turns out to be pretty darn good.  I rate this just below the Initiation of Sarah and Midnight Offerings (Does anyone know where you can find Midnight offerings about 2 teenage witches one good one evil?  By the way you can also purchase this movie on the 4pack from Brentwood ""Evil Places,"" which I have but I would also buy this individual DVD just for backup and maybe some special features.",1136160000,12,1499,4.276595744680851
531295,1,6302989949,"This movie is obviously early 1970s before Kate Jackson was a big name star in charlies angels.  This film lacked just about everything to give it a good reccomendation.  The picture qaulity is not even up to vhs standards.  On the other hand it did have an interesting plot and I was able to sit in one place while watching it.  That is all I can really say except if you buy this movie don't expect much and you won't be disappointed, I would rather see an alfred hitchcock type movie than one like this though.",1109721600,3,513,4.3125
531296,4,6302989949,"Satan's School For Girls.  The title alone conjures up all types of lurid, imaginative ideas, doesn't it?  Personally, I had images of leather and whips running amuck in my brain.  Okay, so it has Kate Jackson (Charlie's ""intelligent"" Angel) in it, but that doesn't necessarily mean that some young lady won't at least sport a tight leather outfit.  Of course, all of my hopes were quickly dashed when I saw the distinctly 70's television-ish credits appear; then the name of Aaron Spelling came up, and I knew my fantasies would not be realized.  As it turns out, though, this is not a problem.  The movie begins with an obviously terrified young lady driving erratically and very quickly down a deserted road, seemingly trying to escape from someone or something behind her.  She manages to make it to the home of her sister, but just when she thinks she is finally safe something scares her so badly her screaming mechanism overheats.  When sis gets home, she finds cops outside and a dead, hanged sister inside.  Liz (Pamela Frank) refuses to accept the obvious conclusion of suicide and decides to enroll herself at her sister's school, the Salem Academy For Women, and conduct an investigation of her own.  At this point, I was a little worried because this movie was giving every indication of being pretty bad.  Once we arrive at the creepy school run by a headmistress everyone calls ""the dragon lady,"" though, the story quickly begins to build momentum.  Liz buddies up with Roberta (Kate Jackson), Debbie (Jamie Jackson), and Jody (Cheryl Stoppelmoor).  Who is Cheryl Stoppelmoor, you might ask?  Well, you probably know her better as Cheryl Ladd.  Yes, there are two of Charlie's Angels in this movie, and that can never be a bad thing.  Anyway, Liz meets up with two teachers, one of whom seems evil and twisted from the very start.  Once the report of another former student's suicide hits campus, Liz is ready to begin seriously snooping around.  When she explores the basement of her dorm, she finds much more than she bargained for (ergo, the Satan reference in the title).
To my surprise, this psychological horror tale of manipulation and evil is actually quite good.  The plot is nowhere near as simple as you might think early on, and the whole atmosphere of the school is deliciously creepy.  There is even one moment capable of producing a little jump in those lucky enough to not already be inured to such tangible effects of horror movies.  The future Cheryl Ladd doesn't get nearly enough screen time, but Kate Jackson plays her part exceedingly well.  The ending is something of a disappointment, I must admit, but the drama leading up to it is more than satisfying enough to leave me with a pretty high opinion of this film.  If I'm not mistaken, this was actually a made-for-TV movie, and as such it is exceptional indeed.  Of course, you won't find any blood and gore here, but the Gothic aspect of the tale really doesn't rely on such overt means of communicating its wickedly evil message.  Satan's School For Girls really beats the odds, serving up a creepy tale worth watching more than once.",1049846400,22,3126,4.776536312849162
531297,1,6302989949,"Though I'm a little embarassed to review a movie which doesn't move, I'm gutting it out because of Pamela Franklin, one of the two cutest actresses in history (the other  being Genevieve Bujold), and in my view the *only* reason for watching this film. Having said that, I don't believe it's as bad as Leonard Maltin thinks it is, because there are a couple sequences in it, especially the one where Pamela goes, lamp in hand, down to the basement level of the schoolhouse in the midst of a thunderstorm, that are atmospheric -- not exactly classic Gothic stuff, but still passably good for a low-budget TV movie. In fact, most of the cast is either superior or respectable (not excluding Jo Van Fleet as the schoolmistress, and of course Roy Thinnes as the eponymous heavy). The problem is the contrived and pointless plot -- it's never explained why Satan, assuming He exists, should show up in this ridiculous little schoolhouse -- unless, like me, He's got a yen for Pamela (or Kate), so when we see him at the end of the film before his ""coven"" of acolytes with a monumental simper on his face, it's more outlandish than anything Aleister Crowley could have dreamed of. At that point, my jaw dropped about 5 inches, but not from horror. For her part, Pamela shows awesome professionalism in a role which insults her acting talent, but which still can't succeed in concealing her charm. It's films like this which make me think there should be a ""Stoicism Award"" at the Oscars, given to the candidate who, in spite of the most formidable obstacles, manages to escape from a movie without needing an exorcist.",998352000,5,1612,4.696113074204947
531298,5,6302989949,"This is a great movie! I love the scene after the ""rat class"" when the one girl has a total breakdown, she is completely convincing & hilarious!

531299,3,6302989949,"Okay...this is actually a difficult review to write because of the nostalgia aspect of the movie.  The picture quality of the disc is not very good.  There are some scratches, marauding dust bunnies, and a big squiggly, snake-like red line that slithers from the top of the screen for about thirty seconds.  When the actors move into bright sunshine most of the color evaporates into a stange purple hue.  The story is also a little on the skimmpy side.  But...I have to say that I enjoyed it very much.  Seeing Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd working together before Charlie's Angels is certainly amusing as is the 70's attitudes and vernacular.  Roy Thinnes, best remembered for The Invaders, is good here as a sympathetic teacher.  I have given the movie three stars but it probably really rates a two; it was just so darn fun to watch it again after all these years.  If you're a fan of the ABC-TV movies of the week that were shown around this time like: Gargoyles starring Cornell Wilde, The Eyes of Charles Sand starring Peter Haskell, The Night Stalker starring Darrin McGavin, The Norliss Tapes starring Roy Thinnes then you will like this in spite of its technical flaws.

picked it up, knowing it wouldn't be of the highest quality.  Boy, my
suspicions about quality were more than correct.  Whatever you do,

""classic"" TV movie, but this disc is so riddled with flaws,
it's practically unwatchable.  The video quality is almost
indescribably terrible...it looks like one of those old filmreels we
used to watch in grade school, complete with all the flecks, big black

equally bad, sounding muffled most of the time and sometimes it's
inaudible.  Unless you REALLY want this movie (since this is the only

531327,3,6302989949,"Released to TV in 2000, Satans School for Girls is a remake of the 1973 TV movie of the same name. The story revolves around a young woman (Shannen Doherty) who enrolls at an all-girls college in Massachusetts to investigate her sister's supposed suicide. She befriends some girls (Julie Benz, Taraji P. Henson & Mandy Schaffer) and becomes involved with a dude (Daniel Cosgrove) while investigating the witchcraft of some Goth chicks (e.g. Victoria Sanchez). Kate Jackson plays the Dean and Richard Joseph Paul a girl-crazy professor.

While this is better than the underwhelming original version, it has its own flaws. Despite the TV budget, it starts out good and mysterious, which goes on for the better part of an hour, but then unravels into cartoony TV horror. Doherty is fine as the dispirited protagonist. While people complain about her dismal disposition it goes with the role. Sanchez stands out amongst the girls at the school, not to mention Schaffer. Despite this, the filmmakers generally drop the ball on the female front, considering the resources at their disposal (and Im not talkin bout nudity or porn). The semi-sleazy professor is the creepiest character while Cosgrove is amiable as Dohertys boyfriend, but their sexual union seems premature and forced. Another thing I liked is a certain plot twist: You think the storys going one way and it suddenly changes. Of course, this is so common now its no longer surprising.

As far as the last 35 minutes go, its tough to pull off satanic ritual sequences with a straight face, which is why Roman Polanski limited the satanic sequence in his Rosemarys Baby (1968) to a mere two minutes at the climax (not that Im a fan of that one-dimensional movie in light of it being 99% drama in an old NYC apartment and 1% horror). Filmmakers have to be careful with these kinds of scenes or they become more laughable than spooky. So most of the first two acts rate a solid B or, at least, B-, but the final act is weak. Still, it's worth seeing for the positives.

The movie runs 87 minutes and was shot at John Abbott College and Montral, Qubec.

The story line holds interest: a girl who is convinced her sister's death was no accident decides to enroll in her college to discover the truth. Cheesey? Yes. But it doesn't matter. None of the characters are memorable. They begin dying one by one as the investigative sister tries to discover what is really happening at this stucco, tile roofed, and desert surrounded school situated in Salem, MA. (It's low budget, remember? Filmed in CA...) The script's heavy reliance on suspence is what makes it so watchable. You wait and watch, hints of darkness and foreboding smattered throughout the protagonist's journey. In some weird way the story well conveys the naivety of youth itself. There's nothing complicated here, only the continual dread that something about this school is not quite right. It's fun to watch, requires no thought, and won't prompt you to check under the bed before going to sleep. There's no lesson or moral to learn. Of course, it doesn't hurt that two of the Angels have parts. I didn't realize that Kate Jackson was the prettiest angel until seeing the movie, as an aside. But no matter. Nothing stops the devil like a little act of arson. The whole place goes up in flames, and the devil slinks back from whence he came, presumably waiting for a next batch of flammable beauties to come along. The world is safe for now.

This older title however is the 1973 original made-for-TV film. It has Pamela Franklin (""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie""), and two of Charlie's Angels, i.e. Kate Jackson, and Cheryl Ladd. Pamela Franklin plays Elizabeth Sayers whose sister Martha's death has been ruled a suicide. Refusing to believe her sister killed herself, Elizabeth embarks on a mission to discover the truth, and goes to Martha's school, an exclusive prep school for women ominously named The Salem Academy for Women. Here, Elizabeth who has taken the last name Morgan, tries to investigate what happened to her sister. She is embraced by the girls there, namely Roberta Lockhart (Kate Jackson) and Jody Keller (Cheryl Ladd).

Before long, Elizabeth becomes aware of strange goings-on at the school involving several of the students and faculty members. The list of suspects increases, and it is evident that supernatural forces are at work. This is an enjoyable film, even though the quality of print is grainy and I wish some company would release these older films in high quality print.

531356,5,6302989949,"WARNING: Some spoilers ahead

Satan's School For Girls (1973) was a made-for-TV horror movie.  This movie stars Pamela Franklin (The Innocents, The Witching, The Legend Of Hell House), Kate Jackson (Dark Shadows, Charlie's Angels), Cheryl Stoppelmoor (known more famously as Cheryl Ladd from Charlie's Angels, CSI: Miami, Las Vegas), Lloyd Bochner (Bewitched, Dynasty), Jamie Smith Jackson, Roy Thinnes (Falcon Crest, Dark Shadows, General Hospital, One Life To Live, The X-Files), and Jo Van Fleet (East Of Eden).

The movie is pretty twisted, dark, spooky, and downright scary at times.  It's also somewhat cheesy at times.  It has that early '70s low budget ""LSD trip"" feel to it, if you get what I mean.  What the plot boils down to is there is a girl who is being chased by a crazy man.  This girl later is found hanged in her room from an apparent suicide.  Her sister refuses to believe it's a suicide and decides to investigate by visiting the school where her sister attended, called the Salem Academy for women.  She enrolls in the college.  Weird and bizarre things start happening with some of the students, including murders.  Eventually it's revealed that one of the instructors is responsible for all the evil deeds that are occurring.  He heads a satanic cult in which some of his students are followers who believe he is Satan.  I'll leave it at that and won't reveal the ending.  It's for you to discover.

I like this movie.  The picture quality is somewhat low and grainy, but I don't mind because this is an old early '70s movie that hasn't been given the cleanup treatment.  If you like twisted horror, then I recommend this flick.",1284508800,4,1653,4.825622775800712

531360,2,6302989949,"Short and low-budgeted 70's TV movie that should have been better. Purchased it because of the great title and because I am a fan of those lost 60 and 70's TV movies. No blood, demons or sacrifices here, just a lot of talking and probing. British actress Pamela Franklin, whom I fondly remembered from the fine Euro psychological thriller, AND SOON THE DARKNESS [1970], plays a young woman investgating the alleged suicide of her sister. She does not believe her sister could kill herself and decides to find out what influences led to this by attending her sister's boarding school. Jo Van Fleet, a terrific veteran character actress [won an Oscar for EAST OF EDEN, 1955 and so great in several Alfred Hitchcock Presents episodes] plays the school headmistress. Her immense talents were wasted as she was reduced to a babbling loon at the end. She definitely should have had a bigger part in this as did another vet Oscar winner Gloria Grahame who, also late in her career, did a similar campy, forgettable 70's B-flick, the cheesy and lurid BLOOD AND LACE, 1971. Vets Lloyd Bochner [cool as the pusher in TONY ROME, 1967] and Roy Thinnes are the only two teachers we see--- the straight-laced but erratic and furtive Bochner being Franklin's prime suspect and most of the gals having a crush on the popular, bohemian Thinnes. Two male murder suspects amongst a group of women plot similar to the excellent FIVE DESPERATE WOMEN [1971], another Aaron Spelling produced TV movie. Kate Jackson is endearing as Franklin's closest schoolmate while Cheryl Ladd is almost unrecognizible---they later went on to fame in 70's TV series Charlie's Angels. After the landmark ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968] there seem to come a whole slew of early 70's devil movies including BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN [1970], BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971], RACE WITH THE DEVIL [1975] and others [THE EXORCIST, 1973, being the apex and in a class by itself]. The torpid Satan's School for Girl's was among the weakest. Sub-par effort by Franklin whose emotions often did not jibe with the threats at hand. OK twist ending does not save this one. I purchased the DVD from Cheezy Flicks. It is grainy, fuzzy, scratchy, has 'bumps 'n dents' but is watchable. If your a die-hard 60-70's TV movie aficionado then it's acceptable but basically public domain quality. Needs a major clean-up although some who saw this on an old non-cable TV set w/ antenna back in the 70's may actually like the found-in-the-attic quality of the film. I purchased this DVD because of the cool foreboding cover art that belies the film's blandness. Unfortunately, two of the five Menu captions did not activate when I pressed the clicker. No trailers or bonus features. No poster art or data inside. I have not seen the BCI Eclipse, Platinum Disc or Direct Source Label DVD versions. Good luck.",1257897600,3,2827,4.867219917012448

It's like a transfer of an old film (without any restoration), with all the specs and ribbon lines across the screen, straight to disc.  There was also times when the film wobbled(?).  Also I don't know why they bothered to put a title menu in, it doesn't work.

Thank goodness it only cost $8.99. Cheesy flicks is right and I'm not talking about the movie.",1256169600,,882,4.022988505747127

For an older movie it is very good, but when you are expecting something with more special effects....doesn't work.",1195430400,,280,4.73469387755102

The right one is Shannen Doherty's. The satanic nemesis is ridiculous, but he only comes out late.",1464998400,,209,4.833333333333333
7833627,2,6302989949,"This 1973 Spelling-Goldberg ABC TV movie has garnered a cult following over the years since it features two future CHARLIES ANGELS among the cast. While Kate Jackson has one of the larger roles here it doesnt show off her talents in the best light and Cheryl Ladds performance is not indicative of the star quality she would exude as Kris Munroe just four years later.

Pamela Franklin has the meatiest part, but the script is rather weak and the execution flat, like most TV-movies of the era. You WILL giggle when you see the part where the Housemother (Jo Van Fleet) is hypnotized into regressing into a chatty, paranoid schoolgirl near the end.

The print is badly scratched, burned and faded and the night scenes are especially terrible in the video quality.

The only other Spelling TV movie I remember seeing was DEATH AT LOVE HOUSE also starring Kate Jackson and while it wasn't that great either, I would recommend it first over this one.",1460246400,3,947,4.7272727272727275
