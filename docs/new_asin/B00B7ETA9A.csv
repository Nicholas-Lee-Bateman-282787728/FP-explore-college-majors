8563605,1,B00B7ETA9A,"Warriors 6 - Attila The Hun. This so called ""documentary"" is as phony as a three dollar bill with more fiction than history. I would have rated it at no stars, but that is not an option. This film is loaded with historical inaccuracies starting with the actor portraying Attila and others who are supposed to be Huns. Huns have been historically described as being mostly being short in stature and with dark skin.

In this depiction of Attila, our ""hero"" comes straight out of Western Europe and I doubt that even stretching the imagination to it's fullest, the six foot six inch tall Scot Rory McCann does not even remotely look anything like a Hun. Over all, events of this film, costume, and historical details are quite historically inaccurate in many areas and unless of course you just happen to like a fictional tale with fierce blood and guts fight scenes, save your money.",1361577600,,882,4.690322580645161
