8208214,4,6304534620,"Genesis 0:7 features episodes 13 and 14 of the series. In episode 13, a new Angel infects the Magi supercomputers and Ritsuko must save the day. We learn a little more about Ritsuko's past in this episode. Episode 14 starts off the second half of the series with a recap of the last 13 episodes, a poem by Rei, and a few clues as to what's to come as Evangelion continues. This volume moves a bit slower than previous ones, but is quite informative. The series becomes more intense past this point.",998611200,,498,4.423913043478261
8208215,5,6304534620,"While I unfortunately ruined Eva for myself with spoilers, this volume totally turned me around, and even though I'd thought about it before, really made me wonder, ""What the ... is going on here?"" The first episode, Lilliputian Hitcher (which, by the way, is the best episode title ever created), keeps you rivited to your seat, which goes to show all the people who think that this show is all action and nothing else just how awesome little tiny computer viruses can really be.
The second episode is one of my very favorites. It's basically two parts - SEELE's recap of all the Angel attacks, which can be quite funny (""...it went bererk!""), but that's not the point. In the second half of the tape, Anno begins to hint at just how screwed up everyone really is. There's Rei's poem, Unit 02's...eh, I'm not gonna spoil it, there's Ritsuko's...uh...paranoia, in a sense, more about Rei being screwed up, some of Gendou being screwed up, some of Asuka being screwed up...basically, it's the best darn character development episode I've ever seen. It's sure not the only one, duh, but it's one of my favs. Then there's the last minute of the ep, and let me tell you...after seeing this, you will NEVER, EVER, EVER be heard screaming at the TV louder EVER EVER AGAIN. 'Nuff said.",992563200,,1278,4.684444444444445
8208216,5,6304534620,"In volume seven of Neon Genisis Evangelion NERV is attacked by a new angel the is trying to infect the Magi. With the Evangelions unable to combat this Angel only Dr. Akagi and Misato can hope to save NERV in a race  against time. Gendo meets once again with Seele, the mysterious  organization that seems to not only fund NERV but control it as well. In  episode 14 Shinji is instructed to test pilot unit 00. Yet is this a test  that Shinji will walk away from. More ofthe mystery surronding Rei, Gendo,  Seele and the Human Instrumentality Project is to be revield. The animation  in this volume is outstanding. The music especially the main theme  ""Cruel Angel Thesis"" is some of the best music I have ever heard.  The voice cast including minor roles, such as the members of Seele and the  staff of NERV are excellent. The person drama in this volume focuses less  on three children. Instead the focus is placed on members we really do not  know much about, such as Dr. Akagi. Warning this volume contains Language,  violence and some mature themes. Suggested viewing age is 13 and up.",961200000,,1090,4.561855670103093
8208217,5,6304534620,"Fans of Ritsuko out there will really enjoy the first episode of this tape.  She really shows her stuff here by taking out an Angel.  She even opens up a bit about her past afterwords.  The second episode starts with a  review of NERV's performance over the past few months by an overseer  organization.  The implications brought forth by this episode, including  its reference to the Dead Sea Scrolls, really makes buying the next tape a  necessity.  Lastly, there's a beautiful delving into Rei Ayanami's mind,  however brief.  Old episodes take on new meaning as the story progresses.",943747200,,587,4.887755102040816
8208218,5,6304534620,"i really liked episode 15. why? it was really funny when asuka proposed that she and shinji kiss for fun. other wise, everyother video in this series is spectacular, not so much episodes 25-26. nge, the best anime  ever~",943228800,,220,4.641025641025641
