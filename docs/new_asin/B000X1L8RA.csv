2996370,3,B000X1L8RA,"After loving Incubus' Red Rocks dvd, I was pumped for this new one.  The problem with this new one is that there is waaaay too much echo in the performances; which is distracting and takes a lot away from the enjoyment.  I don't recall noticing any echo on the Red Rocks dvd, so I don't know if its the particular venue or if its because that's how incubus decided to play that night - with echo.

But anyway, get their Red Rocks dvd - the songs are better, as is the performance.",1196899200,3,480,4.195652173913044
2996371,5,B000X1L8RA,"After watching the Look Alive DVD, it was very apparent that this was the finest DVD Incubus has put out to date. It tops all their previous efforts including gems such as the Morning View Sessions, When Inucubs Attacks II, and Alive at Red Rocks. While each of those DVDs was intense in a musical sense, Look Alive one-ups them by giving you a feel of who Incubus is. I was fortunate enough to meet them this summer on their tour, and they are truly wonderful and genuine guys - something you don't see a lot of in music anymore. You can see the true friendship these guys have for each other and the love they have playing music and traveling the world. The voice over of Mike, the guitarist, provides brief, yet extremely deep insight into the minds of these normals guys..who just happen to tour the world. We get to see them have fun in Iceland, Dubai, and Israel. We see how they have fun with each other, how they spend alone time painting or surfing, and the love of the music they write. The musical performance, from the Chicago show, is a masterpiece. They can take you from an absolute rock in your face jump up and down song like 'Megalomaniac' to ending on the swaying beautiful melodies of ""Aqueous Transmission"". It's truly remarkable to see a band who loves what they do, no matter what the consequences or criticism. They do this for themselves and for the fans. This DVD is an unbelievable gateway into their personal lives, their character, and of course...their unbelievable musical talent.",1196640000,,1511,4.6
2996372,5,B000X1L8RA,"Granted; the first Incubus album i was introduced too was ""Crow Left of...,""  i thought it was a good album. I picked up ""Look Alive"" and ""Light Grenades"" and am now hooked on their sound. In my estimation Ben Kenney is a standout bassist.

I fully intend to buy all their more ""Funk"" oriented albums of the past. But for now I am very impressed by this dvd. I was most impressed by the ""Look Alive"" concert version of Pistola!",1196467200,4,427,4.325
2996373,5,B000X1L8RA,"I'll get my complaint out of the way first...

WHY WOULD YOU PASS ENTIRELY OVER MAKE YOURSELF AND ALMOST ALL OF MORNING VIEW?!

I love Incubus, that'll never change, but those two albums have some of their best material and they completely shunned it. Aqueous Transmission was great (I'd never heard it live before), but come on, they played almost every song off of Light Grenades. And as much as I truly love that CD I wanna hear a collection of new and old songs, not all new with a couple old songs sprinkled in.

That being said, Look Alive, Incubus' newest DVD offering, is yet another winner. Taking a page from their first DVD, When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2, it's more of a clip show. It's primarily set in Chicago (the shots where they pull back so you get a view of the skyline too are incredible), but there's clips from a wide variety of their winter tour. Mixed in is home video footage from around the world of the guys merely having fun.

I've clearly stated my grief with them passing over my two favorite releases, aside from that though I don't have a lot of complaints. Quicksand leading into A Kiss To Send Us Off still gives me goosebumps...they capture the energy of that song perfectly. Let's be honest though, Incubus is at their best when their adding to their songs, and they do that more than a few times here. The complete overhaul they did of Redefine, contrary to what one reviewer said, is amazing. I heard it at the show I was at but feared I'd never hear it again...not so! The extended jam session in Pistola was great, as was the addition to Sick Sad Little World. The one song that truly surprised me, and probably will most fans, is the fact that they played Nebula. What's more impressive is that Brandon nails every lyric.

Overall, Incubus scores again in the DVD category, once again proving how great they are live. I just hope they wise up with their next one and put songs they clearly love playing live (ahem, Under My Umbrella) on the DVD. Past that, any fan of Incubus is sure to find comfort in this release...if only to have the b-sides Punchdrunk and Look Alive.",1196380800,5,2110,4.47012987012987
2996374,1,B000X1L8RA,they now think they are better than they actually are...redefine acoustic is the worst adaptation ever- really really really bad.they talk about being modest and down to earth so much its clear that they like the smell of their own farts way too much,1196294400,3,250,4.704545454545454
2996375,5,B000X1L8RA,"This CD/DVD really depicts the musical talent and passion that Incubus conveys as a band. The CD ranges from bossanova to african/tribal sounds to accompany the movie. The scenes between the songs show that the band isn't afraid to show thier true selves. It almost seems as if they don't put themselves on a pedestal over anyone else, including the listener. One of the scenes shows how each and every band member is not afraid to shake hands with thier biggest fans and it actually makes it a touching scene to see.

I recommend Look Alive to anyone who has never seen or heard Incubus live. Or if you just want to relive the great feelings you felt during the latest tour, then its definitely worth investing $15 to purchase it. Incubus has always been good to thier fans and this is just another addition to what I hope is a growing collection of Incubus DVDs.",1196121600,13,864,4.538461538461538
2996376,4,B000X1L8RA,"With 'Look Alive', Incubus once again proves what an amazing live band they are.

The different concert clips can seem annoying at first, but you get used to them quickly.

Brandon Boyd's flawless live performance is present and his voice is, as always, amazing.

The whole band is on fire...doing what they do best; playing music.

The in-between ""behind the scenes"" footage give a great insight of the band on their worldwide tour. We see them experience different cultures in countries around the world.
We also get to follow Mike when he is getting an operation for his Carpel Tunnel Syndrome.

Standout performances include:
Quicksand / A Kiss to Send Us Off
Anna Molly
Redefine
Nebula
Sick Sad Little World
Aquaeous Transmission",1196121600,7,734,4.983606557377049
2996377,5,B000X1L8RA,"For this DVD the bass player is Ben kenney, Dirk Lance was the bass player until 'morning view' album. The best band in the whole world, 100% recommended.",1341792000,,154,4.535714285714286
2996378,4,B000X1L8RA,"A decade after their breakthrough into the mainstream with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Make-Yourself/dp/B0000296JB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Make Yourself</a>"", Calabasas California's Incubus chronicle their continued success with the release of ""Look Alive"". Part concert, part documentary, the film follows the group as they rehearse, travel the globe, take in various cultures and, of course, perform to thousands of fans who seemingly know every lyric in their songbook. Through it all, we see the band interact with each other, seemingly as chummy with one another as ever -- with the relationships between founding members Brandon Boyd (vocals), Mike Einziger (guitar) and Jose Pasillas (drums) being particularly strong -- which translates into their dynamic and colorful live performances.

Longtime fans may grumble a bit, as the set focuses mostly on material from 2006's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Light-Grenades/dp/B000W1V3ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Light Grenades</a>"" -- the album which they were touring on at the time -- and chooses to ignore even their biggest hits such as ""Drive,"" ""Pardon Me"" and ""Wish You Were Here"". Never fear, though, as the band packs a strong enough punch with the new material that you'll barely miss the tried and true tunes (side note: there are several other live releases from the band that may quench your old-school thirst). Not only do tracks like ""Rogues"" and ""Love Hurts"" spring to life in a live setting much better than on record, but older, more obscure cuts such as ""Nebula"" and ""Redefine"" are given make-overs, with the latter track transforming into a completely different tune altogether. Overall, the band sounds great, with guitarist Mike Einziger being the star of the set. Not only has he shown increased talent and range with each successive album, but he has stepped into his own as a modern guitar hero of sorts. Watching him bust out the Chinese Pipa on ""Aquaeous Transmission"" and noodle away on ""Sick, Sad Little World"" is about as awe-inspiring as today's modern rock gets, folks.

Overall, the sound and picture quality of the DVD are top-notch. Presented in widescreen and sporting a 5.1 soundtrack, this is certainly the most impressive Incubus DVD to date. Through the film, we get to live vicariously through the band and see the wonderful landscapes of Iceland as if we were there while a score composed by Einziger pulses in the background. It just doesn't get much better than that. While it may not serve as an accessible, crowd-pleasing affair, ""Look Alive"" is at the very least an honest and inspiring portrait of a band in love with their craft. Not only does the newer material hold up live, but the band seems as honest and down to Earth as the day they started. It's definitely geared more towards the hardcore fans, so keep that in mind. For more of their hits, look towards ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alive-At-Red-Rocks/dp/B0006709MG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alive At Red Rocks</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Morning-View-Sessions/dp/B000067IX3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Morning View Sessions</a>"".",1280966400,,3279,5.88655462184874

2996380,5,B000X1L8RA,"I have always heard of Incubus, but when I got this DVD I didn't know what to expect.  Watching this I was completely amazed.  I have never heard a band sound so good live before!  They have quickly become my favorite band and you'll see why in this DVD.  It's a more personal look into touring with the band.  You get to see behind the scenes and the incredible live performances.  Brandon Boyd has a voice that never fails to surprise me.  The talent of Mike and his knowledge of so many different instruments is so impressive.  The band as a whole is a step above everyone else and this DVD does not fail to show that.  I've seen them live and can attest to the fact that what you see in this video is what you get at a live show.  They do, in fact, sound that good live and that's all the more reason anyone should buy this.",1262908800,,828,4.11875
2996381,5,B000X1L8RA,"I originally bought the standard single DVD edition of ""Look Alive"" because, 1. I LOVE this Band! 2. New concert footage of this band! But what I did not know was that there was a limited CD/DVD version of it at Best Buy stores. Well, when I found this out naturally it piqued my interest. It turns out the cd consists of 11 original scores created for the dvd by guitarist Mike Einziger and heard at different parts within the dvd. All of the scores are stand-out tracks and great for an Incubus collection. The cd also includes 6 bonus live tracks including the new songs Punch Drunk and Look Alive.
--Bottom Line--
Buy the CD/DVD version of ""Look Alive"" even if it is a few dollars more. Also the DVD is Region 0 so no matter where you buy it from the DVD will work on your player.
Thanks,
And I hope this was helpful. :-)",1257552000,,825,4.261146496815287
2996382,5,B000X1L8RA,"Being an avid Incubus (Brandon Boyd!) fan, I finally acquired this dvd.  It was a well spent purchase, what a fantastic portrait of a very funloving and talented band.  The guys are are incredible performers and watching their comraderie is very enjoyable.  Incubus is and will always be one of rocks premier bands, you're awesome guys!",1234656000,,336,4.964285714285714
2996383,5,B000X1L8RA,"Closest DVD to a live show ever! Blu-Ray is a must. Brilliant footage, very sharply edited and mixed - sound is incredible in surround; makes an art form of the live show visuals alone. Amazing live performances of all of Light Grenades (except LG and Pendulous threads), of Megalomaniac, Pistola, a crazy tripped out version of Redefine. After a totally gripping beginning kicked off perfectly by Dig, we wander through Iceland, Europe, Dubai and Israel with the boys. Then we reach the United States, they perform at home, Mike goes through surgery and his brutal playing recovery and back at it on the road. I definitely appreciated the cutting between different shows on the world tour. Ben Kenney lends a presence that elevates the whole sound. You can really see/hear what a good fit he is. No hate towards Alex, of course. Incubus could never be what it is to me without him, but evolution/change in art, as in life, is inevitable. Anyway, the boys speak for themselves about their tunes and what an amazing ride the band has had. I imagine they invested quite a bit of energy into making this DVD. I'm sure it will VASTLY widen their audience even more. It sheds such light on their great personal characters, personalities and the impetus behind Brandon's songwriting. All in all, a brilliantly produced DVD. It ends on the perfect bittersweet note, worthy of my all time one-and-only fave rock band. Props to the fans who attended 90 shows!",1233619200,,1450,4.804

2996387,3,B000X1L8RA,"While I still beleive after watching this video that Incubus is one of the most creative bands, do not buy this thinking you are getting a full concert. it does however show you glimpses of the band off stage and how they act when not on stage. if you are a fan, buy it,if you just want to watch them perform live, then maybe another video is one you should buy.",1222732800,,362,4.112676056338028

2996391,4,B000X1L8RA,"I have seen Incubus live twice and this DVD was like seeing them again except from angles that i could never have imagined. Good sound quality and great cinematography.  Only complaint is that they go into these random episodes of travel around the world during their set and show stupid stuff that did nothing but help me realize how weird of people the band members of Incubus actually are...If you like their music and enjoy their live performace then I suggest purchasing this DVD. despite how weird of people they are, they put on one hell of a performance",1212537600,,561,4.666666666666667

I have Jamie Cullum live(great jazz dvd), Incubus(morning view dvd), Linkin Park(Texas dvd), U2(live in chicago dvd),etc. To me the sound of the band is fantastic.  I love the way megalomaniac and sick sad little world sound on this dvd.  And the little jazzy music the band plays during the documentary scenes is high quality. The footage of the places they go to make me want to visit where they went!  And, yeah, the review is wrong- Dirk Lance has been gone for years now- it's Ben Kenney-he's good by the way.

Ever since Dirk left the band, I've been stuggling to regain the level excitement for their new music as I had for their older stuff.

""Look Alive"" has provided the elixir I needed to get it back. Musically, this DVD is still the ""new"" Incubus, but it showcases how their ""new"" sound has become more refined and nuanced. Brandon's charisma is stonger than ever and Ben is now fully blended into the band. All these refinements fill out the void the first two post-Dirk releases seemed to have.

In the mean time the Video showcases their travels, and they use some of their experimental instrumental stuff as a backdrop to the video when their not on stage. Very worthwhile!!!",1202515200,,870,4.832214765100671

On the other hand, if you are being introduced into the band, you won't understand most of the product, and you'll get bored with revisited songs, garage sound, and different versions of the same play again and again. You better get ""Nevermind"".

In this review, you better get ""Make yourself""

The new incubus release ""Light Grenades"", its probably the second worst of the band, with a couple of good hits like ""dig"", the rest feels like choosen to fill the record, than for complete the idea, concept or whatever they tried to...
""Look Alive"" makes an effort to give a new hearing of those songs, of course its the hook of the band performances, some nice old tracks live, and all of them presuming exotic travels....however does not work at all.

Fans: Its more of what you dig, oh and got to say, the sound quality its worth the price, five stars to it...buy it!...probably did already.

Beginners: Hear some samples, watch the Love Hurts vid, and if you like what you see...get the morning view sessions, its a long way to get here and you may not want to finish it.

The problem with this new one is that there is waaaay too much echo in the performances; which is distracting and takes a lot away from the enjoyment.  I don't recall noticing any echo on the Red Rocks dvd, so I don't know if its the particular venue or if its because that's how incubus decided to play that night - with echo.

But anyway, get their Red Rocks dvd - the songs are better, as is the performance.",1196899200,3,480,4.195652173913044
3230868,5,B000X1L8RA,"After watching the Look Alive DVD, it was very apparent that this was the finest DVD Incubus has put out to date. It tops all their previous efforts including gems such as the Morning View Sessions, When Inucubs Attacks II, and Alive at Red Rocks. While each of those DVDs was intense in a musical sense, Look Alive one-ups them by giving you a feel of who Incubus is. I was fortunate enough to meet them this summer on their tour, and they are truly wonderful and genuine guys - something you don't see a lot of in music anymore. You can see the true friendship these guys have for each other and the love they have playing music and traveling the world. The voice over of Mike, the guitarist, provides brief, yet extremely deep insight into the minds of these normals guys..who just happen to tour the world. We get to see them have fun in Iceland, Dubai, and Israel. We see how they have fun with each other, how they spend alone time painting or surfing, and the love of the music they write. The musical performance, from the Chicago show, is a masterpiece. They can take you from an absolute rock in your face jump up and down song like 'Megalomaniac' to ending on the swaying beautiful melodies of ""Aqueous Transmission"". It's truly remarkable to see a band who loves what they do, no matter what the consequences or criticism. They do this for themselves and for the fans. This DVD is an unbelievable gateway into their personal lives, their character, and of course...their unbelievable musical talent.",1196640000,,1511,4.6
3230869,5,B000X1L8RA,"Granted; the first Incubus album i was introduced too was ""Crow Left of...,""  i thought it was a good album. I picked up ""Look Alive"" and ""Light Grenades"" and am now hooked on their sound. In my estimation Ben Kenney is a standout bassist.

I fully intend to buy all their more ""Funk"" oriented albums of the past. But for now I am very impressed by this dvd. I was most impressed by the ""Look Alive"" concert version of Pistola!",1196467200,4,427,4.325
3230870,5,B000X1L8RA,"I'll get my complaint out of the way first...

WHY WOULD YOU PASS ENTIRELY OVER MAKE YOURSELF AND ALMOST ALL OF MORNING VIEW?!

I love Incubus, that'll never change, but those two albums have some of their best material and they completely shunned it. Aqueous Transmission was great (I'd never heard it live before), but come on, they played almost every song off of Light Grenades. And as much as I truly love that CD I wanna hear a collection of new and old songs, not all new with a couple old songs sprinkled in.

That being said, Look Alive, Incubus' newest DVD offering, is yet another winner. Taking a page from their first DVD, When Incubus Attacks Vol. 2, it's more of a clip show. It's primarily set in Chicago (the shots where they pull back so you get a view of the skyline too are incredible), but there's clips from a wide variety of their winter tour. Mixed in is home video footage from around the world of the guys merely having fun.

I've clearly stated my grief with them passing over my two favorite releases, aside from that though I don't have a lot of complaints. Quicksand leading into A Kiss To Send Us Off still gives me goosebumps...they capture the energy of that song perfectly. Let's be honest though, Incubus is at their best when their adding to their songs, and they do that more than a few times here. The complete overhaul they did of Redefine, contrary to what one reviewer said, is amazing. I heard it at the show I was at but feared I'd never hear it again...not so! The extended jam session in Pistola was great, as was the addition to Sick Sad Little World. The one song that truly surprised me, and probably will most fans, is the fact that they played Nebula. What's more impressive is that Brandon nails every lyric.

Overall, Incubus scores again in the DVD category, once again proving how great they are live. I just hope they wise up with their next one and put songs they clearly love playing live (ahem, Under My Umbrella) on the DVD. Past that, any fan of Incubus is sure to find comfort in this release...if only to have the b-sides Punchdrunk and Look Alive.",1196380800,5,2110,4.47012987012987
3230871,1,B000X1L8RA,they now think they are better than they actually are...redefine acoustic is the worst adaptation ever- really really really bad.they talk about being modest and down to earth so much its clear that they like the smell of their own farts way too much,1196294400,3,250,4.704545454545454
3230872,5,B000X1L8RA,"This CD/DVD really depicts the musical talent and passion that Incubus conveys as a band. The CD ranges from bossanova to african/tribal sounds to accompany the movie. The scenes between the songs show that the band isn't afraid to show thier true selves. It almost seems as if they don't put themselves on a pedestal over anyone else, including the listener. One of the scenes shows how each and every band member is not afraid to shake hands with thier biggest fans and it actually makes it a touching scene to see.

I recommend Look Alive to anyone who has never seen or heard Incubus live. Or if you just want to relive the great feelings you felt during the latest tour, then its definitely worth investing $15 to purchase it. Incubus has always been good to thier fans and this is just another addition to what I hope is a growing collection of Incubus DVDs.",1196121600,13,864,4.538461538461538
3230873,4,B000X1L8RA,"With 'Look Alive', Incubus once again proves what an amazing live band they are.

The different concert clips can seem annoying at first, but you get used to them quickly.

Brandon Boyd's flawless live performance is present and his voice is, as always, amazing.

The whole band is on fire...doing what they do best; playing music.

The in-between ""behind the scenes"" footage give a great insight of the band on their worldwide tour. We see them experience different cultures in countries around the world.
We also get to follow Mike when he is getting an operation for his Carpel Tunnel Syndrome.

3230874,5,B000X1L8RA,"For this DVD the bass player is Ben kenney, Dirk Lance was the bass player until 'morning view' album. The best band in the whole world, 100% recommended.",1341792000,,154,4.535714285714286
3230875,4,B000X1L8RA,"A decade after their breakthrough into the mainstream with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Make-Yourself/dp/B0000296JB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Make Yourself</a>"", Calabasas California's Incubus chronicle their continued success with the release of ""Look Alive"". Part concert, part documentary, the film follows the group as they rehearse, travel the globe, take in various cultures and, of course, perform to thousands of fans who seemingly know every lyric in their songbook. Through it all, we see the band interact with each other, seemingly as chummy with one another as ever -- with the relationships between founding members Brandon Boyd (vocals), Mike Einziger (guitar) and Jose Pasillas (drums) being particularly strong -- which translates into their dynamic and colorful live performances.

Longtime fans may grumble a bit, as the set focuses mostly on material from 2006's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Light-Grenades/dp/B000W1V3ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Light Grenades</a>"" -- the album which they were touring on at the time -- and chooses to ignore even their biggest hits such as ""Drive,"" ""Pardon Me"" and ""Wish You Were Here"". Never fear, though, as the band packs a strong enough punch with the new material that you'll barely miss the tried and true tunes (side note: there are several other live releases from the band that may quench your old-school thirst). Not only do tracks like ""Rogues"" and ""Love Hurts"" spring to life in a live setting much better than on record, but older, more obscure cuts such as ""Nebula"" and ""Redefine"" are given make-overs, with the latter track transforming into a completely different tune altogether. Overall, the band sounds great, with guitarist Mike Einziger being the star of the set. Not only has he shown increased talent and range with each successive album, but he has stepped into his own as a modern guitar hero of sorts. Watching him bust out the Chinese Pipa on ""Aquaeous Transmission"" and noodle away on ""Sick, Sad Little World"" is about as awe-inspiring as today's modern rock gets, folks.

Overall, the sound and picture quality of the DVD are top-notch. Presented in widescreen and sporting a 5.1 soundtrack, this is certainly the most impressive Incubus DVD to date. Through the film, we get to live vicariously through the band and see the wonderful landscapes of Iceland as if we were there while a score composed by Einziger pulses in the background. It just doesn't get much better than that. While it may not serve as an accessible, crowd-pleasing affair, ""Look Alive"" is at the very least an honest and inspiring portrait of a band in love with their craft. Not only does the newer material hold up live, but the band seems as honest and down to Earth as the day they started. It's definitely geared more towards the hardcore fans, so keep that in mind. For more of their hits, look towards ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alive-At-Red-Rocks/dp/B0006709MG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alive At Red Rocks</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Morning-View-Sessions/dp/B000067IX3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Morning View Sessions</a>"".",1280966400,,3279,5.88655462184874

I have never heard a band sound so good live before!  They have quickly become my favorite band and you'll see why in this DVD.  It's a more personal look into touring with the band.  You get to see behind the scenes and the incredible live performances.  Brandon Boyd has a voice that never fails to surprise me.  The talent of Mike and his knowledge of so many different instruments is so impressive.  The band as a whole is a step above everyone else and this DVD does not fail to show that.  I've seen them live and can attest to the fact that what you see in this video is what you get at a live show.

But what I did not know was that there was a limited CD/DVD version of it at Best Buy stores. Well, when I found this out naturally it piqued my interest. It turns out the cd consists of 11 original scores created for the dvd by guitarist Mike Einziger and heard at different parts within the dvd. All of the scores are stand-out tracks and great for an Incubus collection. The cd also includes 6 bonus live tracks including the new songs Punch Drunk and Look Alive.
--Bottom Line--
Buy the CD/DVD version of ""Look Alive"" even if it is a few dollars more. Also the DVD is Region 0 so no matter where you buy it from the DVD will work on your player.

3230880,5,B000X1L8RA,"Closest DVD to a live show ever! Blu-Ray is a must. Brilliant footage, very sharply edited and mixed - sound is incredible in surround; makes an art form of the live show visuals alone. Amazing live performances of all of Light Grenades (except LG and Pendulous threads), of Megalomaniac, Pistola, a crazy tripped out version of Redefine. After a totally gripping beginning kicked off perfectly by Dig, we wander through Iceland, Europe, Dubai and Israel with the boys. Then we reach the United States, they perform at home, Mike goes through surgery and his brutal playing recovery and back at it on the road. I definitely appreciated the cutting between different shows on the world tour. Ben Kenney lends a presence that elevates the whole sound. You can really see/hear what a good fit he is. No hate towards Alex, of course. Incubus could never be what it is to me without him, but evolution/change in art, as in life, is inevitable. Anyway, the boys speak for themselves about their tunes and what an amazing ride the band has had. I imagine they invested quite a bit of energy into making this DVD. I'm sure it will VASTLY widen their audience even more. It sheds such light on their great personal characters, personalities and the impetus behind Brandon's songwriting. All in all, a brilliantly produced DVD. It ends on the perfect bittersweet note, worthy of my all time one-and-only fave rock band. Props to the fans who attended 90 shows!",1233619200,,1450,4.804

""Look Alive"" has provided the elixir I needed to get it back. Musically, this DVD is still the ""new"" Incubus, but it showcases how their ""new"" sound has become more refined and nuanced. Brandon's charisma is stonger than ever and Ben is now fully blended into the band. All these refinements fill out the void the first two post-Dirk releases seemed to have.

On the other hand, if you are being introduced into the band, you won't understand most of the product, and you'll get bored with revisited songs, garage sound, and different versions of the same play again and again. You better get ""Nevermind"".

In this review, you better get ""Make yourself""

The new incubus release ""Light Grenades"", its probably the second worst of the band, with a couple of good hits like ""dig"", the rest feels like choosen to fill the record, than for complete the idea, concept or whatever they tried to...
""Look Alive"" makes an effort to give a new hearing of those songs, of course its the hook of the band performances, some nice old tracks live, and all of them presuming exotic travels....however does not work at all.

Fans: Its more of what you dig, oh and got to say, the sound quality its worth the price, five stars to it...buy it!...probably did already.

Beginners: Hear some samples, watch the Love Hurts vid, and if you like what you see...get the morning view sessions, its a long way to get here and you may not want to finish it.

3230908,5,B000X1L8RA,Incubus is one of the greatest bands of all time and naturaly Look Alive was great too.,1198972800,,87,4.176470588235294
3230909,5,B000X1L8RA,I bought the product for a Christmas Gift and the person was fascinated with it. The delivery was quick and the rpice was very low....,1198800000,,134,4.4
3230910,3,B000X1L8RA,"This DVD is okay. I own all 3 other Incubus DVDs, and they are better because I enjoy the live concert footage. This DVD is just totally disappointing because the band is consistently changing outfits throughout songs. Why don't they just keep each song from each venue? It is very annoying to watch and see Brandon wearing a hat one shot, then a tank top, then a hoodie...etc...its basically a music video with some live music being played behind it. I have a hard time watching just one song straight through, and I LOVE Incubus

However, the stuff between songs is cool, very artistic and relaxing. But, I'm going to watch Morning View Sessions and Red Rocks instead.",1198627200,5,670,4.677966101694915
3230911,5,B000X1L8RA,Great photography - you really feel like you are there.  I saw Incubus twice and it looks like some of the shots are from the St. Paul concert - hard to tell.  We were right up front.  If you like Incubus you will LOVE this DVD.  Highly Recommend!,1198540800,,247,4.083333333333333
3230912,5,B000X1L8RA,"simply put, ""LOOK ALIVE"" by Incubus was the best live concert montage by any artist released in 2007. most definitely HIGHLY recommended... a must-have for any INCUBUS (brandon boyd / dj (chris) kilmore / michael einziger / jose pasillas / ben kenney) enthusiast.",1198540800,,263,5.1395348837209305
3230913,5,B000X1L8RA,This DVD is great!!! The extra clips between the songs are fun and entertaining.  The song clips are visually stimulating too,1198281600,,125,4.9523809523809526

8226505,4,B000X1L8RA,Oh Incubus - How I have loved you since I was a wee child of 12 in 2000. Line up changes and new musically directions have kept us guessing as to how the new stuff would sound like. This is a concert DVD with music from their two albums at that time of release 2004 - 2006. It wasn't too bad - the package of the DVD is supposed to imitate or pay homage to an awesome authors classic work.,1386288000,,389,3.875
8226506,5,B000X1L8RA,"although it only focuses on one tour date, the footage and songs were great. Also get to see a handsome brandon boyd!",1359676800,,117,4.363636363636363
8226507,5,B000X1L8RA,"Incubus is a solid band and this DVD, while not super exciting or anything, has some good songs, some neat behind the scenes footage (concerts, jamming, hanging out, etc) and just gives a good vibe.

Great for popping in at a party or get together as some background music and imagery",1353888000,,284,4.568627450980392
