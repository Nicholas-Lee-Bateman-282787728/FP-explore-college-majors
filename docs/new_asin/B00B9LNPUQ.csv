5564695,5,B00B9LNPUQ,Season 1 and 2 are great for kids.  My 4 year old loves all the episodes and my 2 year old loves Iron Man too.  I can honestly say that I enjoy watching them as much as the kids.  Would love to see Season 3!,1368489600,,207,3.5555555555555554

5564701,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"I shipped this overseas to my nephew. It continues the story of a young Tony Stark (a good teenage role model). He and his friends love it! If you have an ironman fan, buy the whole series!",1392768000,,189,4.135135135135135
5564702,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"In this second season of the recent Iron Man cartoon, the action is more than in the 1st season, and I'm amazed at how much the creators chose to use so much of the comic book history in their stories. The show explores several key story-arcs in the Iron Man universe, some being the classic ""Armor Wars"", the ""Extremis Virus"", as well as the ""Technovore Virus"". The series does not touch on the character's many love interests or his battle with alcohal, probably because the creators decided to portray a teenage Tony Stark rather than an adult one. However, the show's creators did have the foresight to include several if not all of the many villians who have appeared in the comics over the decades. Crimson Dynamo, Titanium Man, Iron Monger, the Mandarin, the Blizzard & the Living Lazer are all in the series just to name a few. The show is presented in CGI animation which is becoming more popular in recent years, given the sucess of other series using the same form of animation. Transformers: Prime, T.M.N.T on Nikelodeon, and the recent Green Lantern: the animated series are all evidence that CGI animation is the future. All in all, the show is tastefully done, and Iron Man fans should enjoy the series for many of the reasons I mentioned above. Hollywood can easily screw up any potential motion picture featuring Iron Man, thank GOD for animation :)",1392163200,,1366,4.7196652719665275
5564703,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"Season Two of Iron Man - Armored Adventures continues a few months after the end of the first. Tony Stark changes a lot by character but still leaves room for his wit and charm.  I would give away too much regarding appearances from select characters
and a few `What If' moments but very worthy of Iron Man atmosphere.  This will stay in my DVD collection and easily a `marathon'
selection.",1390176000,,390,4.557142857142857
5564704,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"A welcome addition to season one. We really enjoy watching Ironman. There is lots of action, good for all ages.",1389744000,,111,4.6
5564705,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"So sad that they canceled the series, but getting it and the first season in a single box each was good stuff",1381449600,,109,4.0
5564706,4,B00B9LNPUQ,"It's a good series I like the computer animation good stories and I love the guest appearances from the Avengers movie.  The only thing I don't care for is that they made ironman war machine and pepper young, other than that its very good.",1378512000,,239,4.431818181818182
5564707,5,B00B9LNPUQ,My daughter is a big fan of the Iron Man series. We waited for the whole season to become available. I would highly recommend waiting for complete seasons. The packaging could be greatly improved; the discs are stacked up on top of each other so one has to do a lot of shuffling.,1378339200,,279,4.283018867924528
5564708,3,B00B9LNPUQ,"My first regret was the box. I imagined a metal box And the core power flashy. And it's just paper & plastic.
My second was the stories. They are ok. But not amazing like in the first season.
Maybe because we don't see Jin a lot before the end. Maybe because the end was so easy.
I don't know. The second season have good & not so good story. But miss Amazing moment.
Sure he suffer the fact that I watch the Whedon's Avengers. But I expected more",1376870400,,447,4.090909090909091
5564709,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"Though short lived this series was a nice reboot to the Ironman story.  Basically Tony Stark is now a teenager using his Ironman technology to gain back control of Stark Industries.  I won't say much more so as not to spoil any plot lines but suffice it to say a few arch enemies are also now the children of some evil person.

Nice touch as it probably relates to the kids better.  Definitely makes for an interesting Ironman based story line.

Animation is a bit ""computer generated"" looking, switching from excessively detailed shots to some that are more akin to a modern video game.  This seems to be a common theme with many cartoons/anime lately, not bad but annoying to some.",1376352000,,683,4.603305785123967
5564710,5,B00B9LNPUQ,Great show and dvd set. This is not really a review but more information. The first season set was fullframe and cropped to look like it was widescreen. This set is NOT that way. This is what the specification on the aspect ratio state on the back on the dvd set. WIDWSCREEN VERSION PRESENTED TO PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL TELEVISION EXHIBITION. ENHANCED  FOR WIDESCREEN TELEVISIONS. Hope this helps more people to decide to own this amazing season of the show.,1373673600,7,485,4.773809523809524
5564711,5,B00B9LNPUQ,You can't go wrong with Iron man!  nothing else to say but go and buy this series!  Great to watch with your kids,1373587200,4,113,3.869565217391304
5564712,5,B00B9LNPUQ,This was a great cartoon. Sad to see that this is the last season. I love how they took the stories from the comics and put them on the little screen. Anything Iron Man I will give a chance. If you are an Iron Man fan or a fan of cartoons then just get this and Season 1 if you don't already have it.,1373500800,,300,3.703125
5564713,5,B00B9LNPUQ,I enjoyed the season as a whole.  Told me more of the Marvel Universe and say what could be a third season to this series.,1371859200,,122,3.88
5564714,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"I love it the cartoon was so cool and it was perfect
I really did like the cartoon on dvd thanks for send it out to me.",1371772800,,119,3.4444444444444446
5564715,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"I've been very impressed by this series - the animation is fantastic, the stories are well-written.  Sure - young Tony Stark is constantly losing his temper and flying into danger, again and again...you'd think as such a genius, he'd eventually catch on start using his brain before the fighting started.  But that small exasperation aside, it was alot of fun to watch the series unfold.  Many of the story threads started in the first season are neatly tied up, which is satisfying - though it makes me wonder if there is going to be a next season.  Anyway, it's a good series and well worth watching!",1370649600,3,602,4.650943396226415
5564716,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"I have liked this series ever since seeing it several years ago.  Seeing Iron Man portrayed as a teenager (very Spider-man like) is a good idea.  And, now that they have offered this entire season as one reasonably priced package I have to say that I highly recommend this and Season 1.",1370476800,2,286,4.480769230769231
5564717,5,B00B9LNPUQ,My 4 year old can't get enough of this show.  Really great for the younger Ironman fans!  Can't wait for season 3.,1370390400,,114,4.136363636363637
5564718,4,B00B9LNPUQ,"In my opinion, over the past 10 years most action-oriented animated series can't seem to last ay most 2 seasons. To name a few: Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes, Spectacular Spider-Man, Thundercats (2011 Series), Young Justice, Green Lantern, Wolverine and the X-Men, Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002-03 Series), and the Super Hero Squad Show.

I thought Iron Man: Armored Adventures was a great series, especially when I was initially reluctant to watch yet another show whose lead character had been made younger as part of the plot. Nevertheless, this made for great stories and for great appearances by other Marvel characters including Hawkeye, Black Widow, Black Panther, Dr. Doom, and the Hulk. I yearn for the time when an action-oriented animated series will last for more than 2 seasons again.",1369958400,3,858,5.262773722627737
5564719,5,B00B9LNPUQ,My family loves this series.  Plenty of action and no objectional content like some of the other superhero cartoons.  We wish the series was going to continue.,1369008000,,159,4.851851851851852
8564728,5,B00B9LNPUQ,Season 2 is fabulist with a few surprises. I wish there was a season 3.,1497484800,,71,3.8
8564729,5,B00B9LNPUQ,"The kids and I love this. This include the girls 16 and 14 and the 9 year old boy.

The kids go crazy when they hear the theme song..... You will have to look it up if you never heard it.

Stories are great... they are connected to tell a larger story. All of them are full of fun and adventure!
