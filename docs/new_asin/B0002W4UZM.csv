2128355,5,B0002W4UZM,This is an amazing DVD that truly showcases the anointing of God in the life of Donnie McClurkin.  It was both uplifting and inspiring to watch.  It touched my heart and gave me a deeper appreciation for the spiritual and musical gifts that he possesses.  His willingness to share and allow himself to become transparent speaks to his faith and strength of character.  Donnie is truly a blessing from God to all of us!,1118448000,3,418,4.608108108108108
2128356,5,B0002W4UZM,"My spirit connected with Donnie McClurkin's when I first heard of him on his first solo CD in 2001. Songs like ""Stand"" and ""Have a Talk with Jesus"" lifted me above my cares during a very trying time in my life.  Somehow I knew Donnie was singing from his heart. He was not just making good music, he was commisserating with the Lord whether 'we' were getting it or not.  I saw him at Hopeville in San Diego a few years ago and the electricity in the room made me stand up and shout to the Lord.  It was the most amazing corporate worship experience I ever had up to that point.  This DVD gave insight to the reason why Donnie praises and worships the Lord the way he does.  He has a testimony that will encourage and inspire any of us who have a 'past' that satan wants to use to hold us down.  God has a greater purpose for His creation and He will use every experience we go through to that end if we place ourselves in His hands.  He is the 'recovery' hurting people need.  It is a wonderful, unashamed 'life story' that Donnie shares with us on this DVD. It can encourage anyone, no matter what you've been through or have done, that you can get back up again.  God bless Donnie McClurkin for sharing this very open, honest, poignant testimony of his life and deliverance.",1114646400,17,1276,4.261410788381743
2128357,5,B0002W4UZM,"How someone can go through all of that and come out victorious is amazing. I'm not the biggest Donnie fan but after this I can't help but admire the guy and get more music of his. Donnie should be proud of himself.

The dvd is highly informative and has nice performance clips... furthermore how someone can sing like that with a sist on your vocal chord is crazy.

If you are a fan you'll love it - even if your not you'll find something to enjoy. It is very well put together and worthy of your money and a spin in your dvd player.",1112572800,10,533,4.115384615384615

This just goes to show that you can make it no matter how hard your struggle is.  This is why God lets us go through different trails and tribulations.  When we prevail, we can tell the story and help someone else.  The music is a blessing and it speaks directly to your heart.  Pastor Donnie really did come from darkness into the light.

2128385,5,B0002W4UZM,"I first heard this young man many years ago, before I retired.  Of course being my age I don't like many of the new sounds, but this young man has many songs that I enjoy hearing.  The story of how he got to where he is, takes a vast amount of guts to tell.  I relate to much of the story because we were a singing family.  Never really well known, but then I raised my children as a singing family and much of what was shown in his video, also happened in my family as I raised my children.  It was almost like seeing relatives, but then that is probably part of his reaching power, he is so very like everyones family.  I loved it",1373846400,,632,3.9761904761904763

Therefore, You Can Experience It Too.

2128406,5,B0002W4UZM,"Donnie has an awesome story.  It couldn't have been told any better.  I'm glad he did it himself and used all the people that went through this with him.
It is raw and true.  This story will be able to reach out and help others who are struggling with the trials in their lives.  It will give them hope to go on and have faith that God will bring them through whatever they are dealing with and Donnie is a living witness that God can.  He will help others to step out on faith and let God heal them.  Nothing is impossible for him.  He has a testimony that everyone should see and hear.  He lets you know that God is real even when you've gone through the worst of times, God can bring you through and have something so amazing for you that you can't even comprehend it.
He let go and let God.  Awesome Donnie!!!  I recommend everyone to see this story. If you are seeking God or just lost and trying to find your way, see this video, it will bring you to the light.

2128409,5,B0002W4UZM,"This was an excellent DVD.  It can be helpful to those whose hope have been shattered because of brokeness in the family unit.  This DVD presents light at the end of the tunnel if we don't give up and if we seek a higher power, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to help us.

Excellent indeed!",1236211200,,292,4.178571428571429

2128413,5,B0002W4UZM,"I thought this was an excellent movie.  It goes to show that we don't have to stay in the dark, no matter what the obstacle, because Jesus is the Light of the World.  He will bring you to him, just rely totally on Him and deliverance will come, victory will come, mountains will be moved! I was especially moved when I heard Donnie McClurkin's testimony regarding the song ""Stand.""  (By the way, it is my favorite song.)It is through these life changing experiences that Jesus can do his greatest work, when we rely on him. So stop trying to fix the problem, for you see, after you've done all ""you"" can, just ""Stand,"" and watch the Lord see you through.  Another good point was Donnie's remark about the ""mothers"" in the church who kept him in line.  They encouraged him to be a man.  They told him this is how a man should act.  With so many ""fatherless"" homes, we need the good old mothers today, but where are they?

I do wish that there was more time in the movie to hear more verses of the songs that were sung; but that would have made the movie too long.  I was able to listen to some of the songs from the extras. Even the ""behind the scenes"" look was encouraging.  Just think, even Donnie McClurkin gets nervous, but he has a job to do, and he does it - minister to the people.  That's the example for all of us.  You have a gift and God will help you to use it.

One final thought, regardless of what the world says, God created ""man,"" and ""woman"" to be his help meet.  That's the way it ""is"" to be.  Those practicing ungodly ways, you too need to come out of the darkness to the light.",1168300800,,1597,4.19016393442623

Someone telling his courageous life story.  This DVD what incredibly inspiring.  I can't say enough about his ability to live when life was hard, his courage to tell the most intimate secrets in order to help others, his drive to do what God called him to do, his passion to tell others about the One who delivered him...I am forever changed by his testimony.",1146787200,5,532,4.3979591836734695
