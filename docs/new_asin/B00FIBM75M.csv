5993281,4,B00FIBM75M,"This is a total body toning workout, using the high reps and compound moves to boost your metabolism. My body doesnt gain much strength from these workouts, but they do get my heart rate up and so I view them as more metabolic workouts.  So since I didn't absolutely love this workout, I gave it 4 stars.  If you are a total body workout fan, you may just love this workout.

Workout details:
Warm Up  7:14
Workout  44:36
Stretch  4:46
Total  56:36

There are 3 premixes ranging in time from 39 to 48 minutes.

Equipment needed for this workout:

Dumbbells  Cathe uses 8, 10 and 25 pounds
Slide n Glide Discs
Green (medium tension) stretch band
Green (medium tension) firewalker band
Mat.

I had a tough time writing this review.  I personally don't like total body workouts and I much prefer to do splits, doing one or two body parts per workout.  I view these workouts like broccoli; I dislike them, but I know they can be good for my body.  It is good to mix things up.

Here are a few highlights from the workout:

WARM UP

As we are doing the usual reach and tap, Im thinking to myself, Did I already do this workout earlier this week?  Scary since I don't remember doing it.  Then it comes to me, the song in the warm up must also be in another workout.

LEGS & SHOULDERS

We start with the usual squat presses with 8 pound dumbbells.  Yes, I know these get the heart rate up, but these seem to be in every Cathe workout lately.  There must be another way to work shoulders and back.

The put weights down, cross one leg back and push weights up section is tough.  I don't go nearly as fast as Cathe since I was afraid that Id tweak my knees.

Now, on to shoulders.  In a word, ouch.  Cathe was using 8 pound weights and I could barely handle 7 pounds.  To be fair, I am in the middle of an STS heavy weight rotation and my muscles are tired.

BACK

I was talking back to Miss Cathe when she said, okay, on to back.  Im picking up the 25s.  Im saying, Well, Im not.

LEGS & BICEPS

More compound exercises, like rear lunges while doing bicep curls.  Cathe was using 8 pounds for the bicep work and for some reason; my arms were really tired so I used 7 pounds.  I actually welcomed the leg work since it distracted me from the bicep pain.

CHEST WITH DISCS

The infamous burpee pushup combo with the discs is back.  Im focusing so hard on making sure the discs don't fly out from my feet that I don't notice the pushups.

I hated the drop set pushups. I hate pushups anyway, but dropsets are worse.  You do 12, 10, 8 and 6 pushups.  I love how Shaun T. sneaks in pushups, not this pushup overkill.

DISC LUNGES

Looking back, there was a lot of leg work in this workout.  I never really did feel my legs burn.  I guess I should use heavier weights for legs next time.

TRICEPS

I thought this section was overkill.  The triceps muscles are small and don't need a lot of reps to fatigue them.

LEGS FIREWALKERS

Oh no, more legs.  I initially thought I might use a heavier tension firewalker band, but quickly decided that was not necessary.

CORE

Ankle grabbers are the first thing.  The pace is fast and you can tweak your back and not really work your core if you aren't meticulous about form.

I especially liked the new exercise where you have a weight (8 lb) in one hand.  You roll down and then roll up while pushing the weight overhead. You really feel this in the obliques!

P.S.  You may be wondering why I have this workout since I don't like total body workouts.  Well, I am big Cathe fan and must have every workout she puts out. : )",1381449600,5,3552,4.226047904191617

5993284,5,B00FIBM75M,"Love it, Flex train hits all your muscle groups in an hour.  Challenging yet doable.  As always Cathe's cuing is great and this is a nice addition to any routine.  The time saver pre-mixes are also nice.",1435449600,,203,4.4324324324324325

5993288,3,B00FIBM75M,"This DVD is for an advanced exerciser. Parts of it are quite difficult for the average Joe, so access your strength, agility, and stamina before buying this. I don't like the fact that Cathe uses so many accessories throughout the workout.  Just weighs and maybe a stretch rope would be acceptable, but the other two items are just something else I will eventually have to buy, if I want to follow the routine exactly.",1405814400,2,418,4.648648648648648
5993289,5,B00FIBM75M,"I was looking for something different than my traditional (and boring) 'upper body weights one day, lower body the next' routine.  I wanted something that was energized and fast-paced.  This workout is just that and so much more!  It keeps my heart pumping with the compound metabolic exercises!  And it goes by so fast!  The workout focuses on a a muscle group and works them out with high reps before moving on to the next, combining upper and lower together, which I find more challenging then my previous routine.  My muscles become fatigued during the routine, and while not overly sore the next couple of days, I do feel them more so than before!  Flex-train is not a full cardio work out, nor a hard-core weight work out, but something in between for those of us who want an energized strength and toning workout. As usual, Cathe does not disappoint!",1396310400,3,857,4.673333333333333
5993290,5,B00FIBM75M,"Wow Kathe!  You've done it again.  This is a total body workout with toning and cardio.  I was doing the Cross Train which I love, but since my shin injury I can't handle the impact, but eventually will incorporate it back into my workout.  Thanks!",1391644800,,248,4.444444444444445
5993291,5,B00FIBM75M,"As others have given a complete breakdown of the workout, I won't do that here.  I have done this workout 4 times now, and each time I find myself challenged by it.  Some have likened it to Supercuts.  While Supercuts is a great workout in its own right and will definitely give you a great workout, I feel that Flex Train uses heavier weights and is a bit more focused on strength training.  Here's the breakdown:

Pros:

1) A lot of variety in this workout. While there are some old favorite moves (tricep kickbacks while in a plank and lunges on the disc), all of them are highly effective.  I have felt this workout the day after every single time, especially in the glutes.  Also, the use of the discs and the resistance band mixes things up nicely.
2) I like the fact that Cathe doesn't use all 3 and 5 pound weights in this workout.  I like to strength train two times a week at least, with one heavy and one lighter day.  I use Cathe's Upper Body Pyramid when I want to do some serious work, but like Flex Train for the fact that it still gets some nice weight work in without being too easy.
3) The core work at the end was fantastic.  There were some new moves in there (such as holding an 8 pound dumbbell on one side and doing a sit up with an overhead press as you come up - worked the obliques nicely), along with standard and reverse crunches.
4) The music, while sometimes cheesy, was overall motivating.  When I recognized some oldies but goodies it had me smiling during the workout.
5) I often feel that Cathe's total body workouts neglect the biceps, but not in this workout.  The pulses with one leg up were having my biceps screaming (of course, I was using 10 pound instead of 8 pound dumbbells).
6) While I may be a masochist for saying this, I loved the exercise towards the end with the firewalker band.  Cathe has you move up and back with the band on, and then do some side to side motions.  A nice way to work the outer thighs.

The Cons:

1) Cathe always hits the triceps pretty hard, but I felt that the amount here wasn't really necessary-the same way I feel about the tricep track in her High Reps workout.  And then having to repeat all of those tricep exercises.....ugh.

Overall I'd say this is a nice intermediate workout.  It did get my heart rate up at time with the compound exercises offered, but also offered some nice weight training.  Pick this one up if you like a nice total body workout that leaves no muscle untouched.",1390867200,14,2466,4.328976034858388
5993292,5,B00FIBM75M,Cathe always produce great workouts.  This works well for me because I can add to other workouts.  This is  very similar to Super Cuts.  Don't think you will be disappointed.,1389484800,2,174,4.7
5993293,5,B00FIBM75M,"This hits pretty much everything in one workout. I like that I can turn off the music and just hear her voice. I like the menu setup, none of the moves require you to defy physics and since it keeps moving steady my heart rate stayed up the entire time. I like there is a stretch to do at the end which is the perfect segue for me to foam roll after the workout. No weights, medium weights or heavy weights the workout says advanced but I think some smarter newbies or middle of the road exercisers will do just fine. Do it without weights first time through if you're not sure. I'm positive all the stored cheeseburgers on your butt will be screaming even without any weights.",1381622400,7,677,4.296875
8615927,5,B00FIBM75M,love all her videos . good instructor and goods workout,1500854400,,55,4.6
8615928,5,B00FIBM75M,"Another great Cathe workout! I really liked this one, nicely paced. I could change weights, put on the band, or pull out the sliders and not feel like I was rushed or wasting time. The workout was well done, I liked the music as well. I will put this one on a regular circuit!",1490918400,,276,4.12962962962963
8615929,5,B00FIBM75M,"I've been working out to Cathe videos since the '90s, and consider myself intermediate level. She never fails to make me work and actually enjoy working out (that's quite a feat). I can keep up with her on virtually all of her older workouts, like Total Body STS, Pyramid, and Supersets. Those all seem to build in more rest with heavier weights (although not necessarily lower reps). My first time through this workout, I caught myself thinking, ""Oh, I should go heavier next time."" Hah! I actually dropped DOWN in my weights about 1/2-way through, from 8 to 5 and 10 to 8 (I don't have 25 pound dumbbells for back, but 20s more than did the job for me). The moves are FAST and high rep, so heavier weights seem risky to me until I'm stronger.

I was a little worried it wouldn't be a ""metabolic"" workout, since there's very little cardio of any kind. But my heart rate stayed way up throughout the workout, and every muscle was worked to exhaustion. As a total body workout, I really prefer this to Cathe's older, slower workouts that give lots of rest, since I feel like it's a faster, more efficient way to get lean and strong (time will tell).

If you're new to Cathe, I'd say she works you harder than either P90x or P90x3 as one example, and with much better cuing and form pointers. (She also actually does the entire workout with you, which I strongly prefer to Tony's folksy talk-talk-show off style.) If you're ready for a serious challenge, this is a great workout. If you're new to Cathe or not an experienced exerciser, you might be better off starting with one of her earlier workouts that give more instruction, rest, and time to complete each exercise. Circuit Blast, Body Max 2, or Supersets/Push Pull might be better places to start, although they're not easy, either.",1466985600,7,1787,4.58125
8615930,4,B00FIBM75M,"Another great Cathe workout.  Not as flexible as the ICE format, but still a great, effective workout.  This one is more upper body centric, Which is fine, just wish I had known that before hand.  I still like to do this one though.",1464739200,,232,4.348837209302325
8615931,5,B00FIBM75M,I LOVE all of the Cathe videos I have purchased!!,1464480000,,49,4.0
8615932,5,B00FIBM75M,"I absolutely LOVE this workout!  No muscle is left untouched and because most exercises are compound the heart rate stays up there.  After a warm up that had me winded (I'm more of an intermediate exerciser but improving due to Cathe's DVDs) Cathe targets the shoulders; I started with the recommended 8 pounds but eventually had to drop down to puny 5's.  She does alternating overhead presses and does a lot of them before doing more lateral and front chest work.  She then moves on to the back with a resistance band, legs with gliding discs (I haven't tried the discs yet but will soon enough), a slew of bicep curls, drop down push-ups for the chest and then the triceps (if I have these out of order I apologize!).  Other reviewers haven't liked the amount of time she spends on triceps but I appreciated it; I can't do a kickback in a plank position yet (I adjusted by doing traditional kickbacks with 12 pound weights) but you feel it by the time it's over!  Think the kickbacks, tricep dips, tricep push-ups... yes, quite a few but I love working my arms. She finishes on the floor concentrating on the abs, which I also modified because many of the exercises require you to do a full sit-up or raises with an 8 pound weight; I really felt it on my tailbone and although I could follow along I didn't want to tweak my back.  Superman crunches, regular crunches, and oblique twists with the 8 pound weight were fine but if you have back issues I'd definitely alter a few of moves.  Overall, though, this was a great workout that burned a ton of calories and the time flies by!  It's more metabolic than cardio but I burn more calories with this DVD than I do with some of Cathe's HiiT and XTrain routines and it didn't require a ton of equipment.  Highly recommend!",1459641600,2,1773,4.461300309597523
8615933,5,B00FIBM75M,If you enjoy Cathe's workouts this makes a great addition to rotate in on non-aerobic days or if you're getting your aerobic activity somewhere else that day.,1456790400,,158,4.888888888888889
