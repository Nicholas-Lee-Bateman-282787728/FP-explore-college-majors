5098935,5,B007LNBRKQ,Basically a docudrama with only the Charlston Heston character and his son being ficticious. Outstanding spciale effects that doesn't seem cartoonish like special effects in other similiar movies.,1341532800,,196,6.035714285714286
5098936,5,B007LNBRKQ,"""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" (1970) is a recreation of the events leading up to and the Day of Infamy displayed from both sides of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Naturally there will always be people that are not satisfied with the accuracy of this recreation.  There is a little controversy due to the collaboration between American and Japanese filmmakers causing some compromise of having both sides of the story in one film.

Other than a will paced film that keeps your attention, the real surprise is all the DVD goodies. The most important is the running narrative. It does some of the explaining of the differences between this film and reality without making excuses. After watching first with out the narrative, then with the narrative, it is time to watch it again and notice the points made on how the scenes were shot, the people picked and how they attempted to make the bulk of the film comply with history as we remember.

It does not make sense to repeat the narrative or the story in this review. Let's just say you will not be disappointed with the movie or all the DVD goodies.

5098937,5,B007LNBRKQ,"This blu ray uses the same print and extras as the book version did. They have taken the picture and cleaned it up and restored it completely. Frame by frame; the way you would hope all movies on blu ray would be done. This is one of the best war movies ever made too; because it is one of the most accurate ever made. The acting is excellent as well featuring  many great character actors and at the time it was one of the most expensive movies ever made. If it had been released ten  years later it would have been a huge hit in America; but the vietnam era just wasn't ready for a movie like this one. This has several excellent extras too , the backstory from amc is fantastic. You learn two men lost their lives making the film, and the studio heads lost their jobs because of it. A Japanese director had a nervous breakdown on it as well. Many of the action scenes which had men running for their lives were in fact just that. As planes went out of control and headed straight for them! This great blu ray is a huge improvement on what was out before. Fox relized the importance of this movie and did it justice on this blu ray. The color is even restored, the sound is enhanced into 5.1 too. That makes this look and sound truly fantastic. Film grain is natural on this one and that's ok too.  Film buffs and war buffs should own this one due to it's excellence in both blu ray presentation as well as it's accuracy in telling of the pearl harbor disaster.  One thing that you will learn about this movie is that the actor Jason Robards was at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked and was overcome at first when shooting there in 1969 as it all came back to him.  This film still remains gut wrenching for the viewer as well as the action is very well done too.",1340323200,8,1765,4.1946902654867255

5098943,5,B007LNBRKQ,"The best (and classic) movie on the Pearl Harbor attack. Even after 47 years, it's still the most accurate and realistic movie ever made on the subject. The 2001 movie ""Pearl Harbor"" starring Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale is a joke by comparison.

There are a couple of minor errors in the details. For example,  the battleship USS Nevada is depicted as having four triple 14-inch gun turrets. This is not correct: it was armed with two triple turrets and two superfiring twin turrets. There is also a scene which shows a US destroyer armed with a single 5-inch gun forward and the second forward gun replaced by a radar. This may have done in the 1950s but it certainly was not done during WW II.

Every detail of the vaguely and ambiguously worded messages from Washington to Pearl Harbor is accurately portrayed.",1513900800,2,817,4.699300699300699

5098960,5,B007LNBRKQ,"Famous for being one of those ""movies which nearly broke the studio,"" Tora! Tora! Tora! cost more money to make than the Japanese spent on actually attacking Pearl Harbor in the first place. Shot on location at Pearl Harbor and its surrounding environs, the movie is a painstaking recreation of the sneak attack designed to cripple the American Pacific Fleet on December 7, 1941. In the days before CGI, the only way to render something this spectacular on screen was to actually stage it, and the battle scenes themselves are spectacular. Planes explode left and right, battleships sink and capsize, and the last thirty minutes of the soundtrack is basically that of engines roaring and explosions going off.

Although criticized by some for its almost documentary style of filmmaking, the movie does a great job of taking you behind the scenes of both the Japanese and the American high commands in the build-up to the attack and during its execution. Delving into the background documentaries, it's fascinating to learn that acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa directed a portion of the Japanese segments, until finally undergoing a meltdown which resulted in his smacking a crew member around the head and threatening to commit ritual suicide when the movie studio finally fired him. The documentaries cover both production and the movie's basis in historical fact and are an entertaining way to kill a couple of hours after watching the main feature itself.

The movie looks great in high-definition, and the soundtrack mix will shake your house if you want it to. Tora! Tora! Tora! has aged well, and shines far brighter than Michael Bay's modern attempt to tell this same story. This Blu-Ray belongs on the shelf of every World War II afficionado.",1489190400,5,1752,5.037931034482758

5098965,5,B007LNBRKQ,"I found this film to be more accurate than any other account of the buildup and execution of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Having read the book upon which the movie is based made the movie even more meaningful. The details of how we were caught flat footed by this attack and the simultaneous attack in the Philippines were appalling to say the least given what our intelligence people revealed from breaking Japanese codes. The aerial photography of the aircraft of the time was stunningly good. Even though a US carrier was used to show the launch of the attack in the movie, one must overlook the obvious and pay attention to what is going on. Being a joint US-Japanese film, the portrayals were unflinchingly honest for both sides. For any military historian and military movie buff, this has to be right at the top of your list of all time bests. A historical document of the first order.",1483228800,5,891,4.610062893081761

5098983,5,B007LNBRKQ,"The film portrays the events leading up to and during the 'Sunday 7th December 1941' attack on 'American' naval-base
'Pearl Harbour' 'Hawaii' from both sides of the divide.
With the 'American's' making noises about the 'Japanese' activity in 'China' - 'Japan' considers it's options whilst continuing
to portray peaceful intent toward 'America'
However 'Japan' are already considering an attack on the 'American' Pacific-Fleet based in 'Hawaii' preparing for the possible
attack and making six aircraft-carriers ready to sail with 'torpedo carrying planes'
The 'American' Military and Political institutions divided in opinion with messages from the Japanese not being deciphered, though there are those that believe an attack will come, therefore preparations for such an event are inadequate.
Undetected the Japanese fleet position themselves within striking distance, to follow International law the Japanese intend to
declare War upon America one hour before the attack, a message that was not delivered correctly until after the event.
The American operatives given the task of using the newly acquire Radar Equipment had not received proper training.
The attack from a Japanese prospective a complete success.......it brought the Americans into the War, a sleeping giant had been awoken, during the attack. 2400 personnel were killed, 1200 injured, twelve war-ships either sunk or damaged along with dozens of fighter aircraft destroyed on the ground.
The film offering an authentic and well staged re-enactment of events, both in planning and indeed execution, the special-effects
really very good and realistic considering the film was released in 1970.
The film given a very acceptable Blu-ray upgrade, picture and sound quality is good.

5099005,5,B007LNBRKQ,"`Tora Tora Tora' cinema-released in 1970 is beyond dispute the best film ever made about the Japanese Navy's December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, incomparably superior to the juvenile, toe-curling 2001 embarrassment `Pearl Harbor' directed by Michael Bray and `starring' (if such a word can be used) the unfortunate Ben Afflick.

TTT adopts a meticulous documentary style and tells the story from both US and Japanese perspectives in two separate and eventually interlocking narratives, deploying a large cast of characters but no obvious `stars' to focus the sympathies of the audience. The Japanese viewpoint is told by Japanese actors speaking Japanese and directed by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku (Akira Kurosawa was initially engaged for the job, but worked too slowly and proved too much of a control freak, so was replaced). The American narrative is directed by Richard Fleischer. Caution: the first two thirds of the film may not appeal to viewers seeking only the excitement and titillation of combat action scenes, as the 18-month diplomatic build-up to the Japanese attack is chronicled with intelligence and fine detail. This background however serves to build the tension for the final reel very effectively, and places the action against a deeper perspective.

The scene of the actual attack lasts only 30-minutes, but soaked up the majority of the film's $25million budget, an unprecedented cinematic extravagance in 1970. As other reviewers have pointed out, there was no CGI in 1970: real aircraft and real ships were used (or the next-best thing: realistic 50-foot scale replicas). Mock dogfights were flown by real pilots in real vintage P40s and AT6 Texans `enhanced' to make them as close as possible in appearance to Japanese naval aircraft, and the carnage on the USN capital ships and the USAAF bases during the attack was created with real explosions and real danger to the stuntmen, several of whom were killed or injured during the filming. This long air-raid scene still looks absolutely stunning and utterly convincing, though being 1970 you don't see the horrific injuries detailed close-up as you might in a more recent production such as Spielberg's `Saving Private Ryan'.

Due to this profligacy of spend on visual spectacle, TTT didn't break even for the studio on initial release but the film's reputation has grown over the years. It's a movie with a script so intelligent, with a narrative so well-crafted and edited, that you can watch it again and again and each time gain a deeper understanding of the complex historical perspective. The only mild criticism levelled at the film is that the Japanese treachery is whitewashed to a degree, with Hirohito's direct culpability airbrushed out as he was at the time of filming still constitutional monarch in the by-then reconstructed and democratic Japan, and this criticism does hold merit but does not take away from the power of the film.

The 2012 Blu-Ray from Fox Searchlight is the best-ever release of TTT, with astounding image clarity and sharp detail. You get both the original 136-minute English-language theatrical release with Japanese dialogue subtitled, and the extended 148-minute Japanese cinema release including a couple of extra scenes:  a poignant scene of Yamamoto being ushered in to the Emperor's presence to discuss the planned attack, and a comedy vignette of two galley cooks on one of the Japanese carriers where the elder one tries to explain to the younger stooge-character how their crossing the international dateline means they are now living through yesterday again.

The Blu-Ray also includes an impressive menu of extras. The most interesting is a 90-minute documentary backstory of the film, its ruinous budget and the problems between Fox and the ageing, paranoid Kurosawa (""in three weeks, he had filmed only eight minutes of unusable material""), how the special effects were done and critical reception of the film on its 1970 release. Additionally, there's newsreel from 1941 and the documentary film `A Day of Infamy'. I also have the previous 136-minute DVD release in my collection, but the Blu-Ray beats it hands down for sharp image quality and as an overall viewing experience. Recommended unconditionally to anyone interested in the origins of America's entry into WW2, to action-movie fans and cinema buffs everywhere.",1408924800,3,4358,5.236389684813753

Things we still can't get right today.,1400716800,,289,4.2727272727272725
5099010,5,B007LNBRKQ,"It is hard to make a more complete film concerning Pearl Harbor and the events that caused the war. You have to feel sorry for Yamamoto who was opposed to the war but did his duty for his country with great regret. He was educated at Harvard and knew and loved the American people. He knew that the only chance of checking the American presence in the Pacific was a decisive attack which would cause America to pause and restrict the American response. To really tell the story would make the movie too long.
Lessons can be learned from this movie that apply in todays world.

5099011,5,B007LNBRKQ,"I saw this movie while I was stationed in Japan and I was the only American in the theater. A fact that seemed to have escaped me when I suddenly began applauding when the two American pilots were able to take off and shoot down a few enemy aircraft. People turned around and looked at me. Of course, I did the same thing as if I was searching for this person who seemed to be cheering for the wrong team.",1391904000,,405,4.075
5099012,5,B007LNBRKQ,"I'm not going to discuss the actual film itself, since views can be very subjective. What I will talk about is the quality of the actual Blu-ray itself.
I watched it on a 60"" Sony, rear projection HDTV, with Bose Theater Surround sound. The visual is razor sharp. The sound is as close to true surround as a 1970's film could get. Disc has 2 versions, theatrical release and Japanese extended.
If you ever wanted to watch this movie in HD, Blu-ray is the way to go.",1391385600,4,465,4.35632183908046
5099013,5,B007LNBRKQ,"This transfer is crystal clear. Also the disc offers the Japanese Market extended version which includes more of the Japanese footage shot by Akira Kurosawa. This extra material fills out the background of the Japanese side much more effectively. I have the older DVD version, and this Blu Ray is much much better.",1390608000,11,314,4.943396226415095
5099014,5,B007LNBRKQ,"A thrilling story of the events leading up to, and including, the attack on Pearl Harbor. Although the story is told in an almost documentary-like manner, the actual events are so interesting that there is no need for over-dramatization. The story is presented from both the American and Japanese sides, giving you a much broader perspective on America's entry into World War 2.",1389139200,,378,5.015873015873016
5099015,5,B007LNBRKQ,"Forget the ""Pearl Harbor"" movie with its silly love story and total lack of historical accuracy  This movie, ""Tora Tora Tora,"" is the film to see if one wants to see a movie that really portrays some of the true events about the Dec 7, 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor. It's a bit stiff at times, but it does try to get most of the facts and the timing of the events as right as the filmmakers knew when this movie was produced. Very entertaining and your brain will not turn to mush as it will if you watch the other movie.",1388534400,3,520,4.098039215686274
5099016,4,B007LNBRKQ,Solid story told from both sides of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The film moves well between the Japanese and American points of view both diplomatically and militarily. The attack scene itself was dated as it relied on models. Remember the film was released in 1970 before all the digital stuff was even thought of.,1387843200,,323,4.684210526315789

5099018,5,B007LNBRKQ,"I'm not particularly a fan of war movies but this film, depicting the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, is presented with attention to the historical facts and features a cast of great character actors, popular in the 60's and 70's.  Tora, Tora, Tora was made long before CGI (computer graphics) that is used so extensively today and features both the Japanese and American point of view of the event that brought America in to World War II,  Fox has brilliantly restored the movie in blu-ray.",1384473600,3,489,4.741176470588235
5099019,5,B007LNBRKQ,"Because I have always loved this movie when I first saw it back in the early 70s when I was about 12yrs old in a movie theater back then known as the CINERAMA, in QUEEN ST AUCKLAND NEW ZEALAND, this movie theater was the only one of its kind in NZ as it had a GIANT OVAL 70mm PROJECTION SCREEN, it sadly got demolished in the early 80S TO MAKE WAY for shopping mall complex & a multi cinema complex.
 What I liked about this movie, was, the story nearly so true to the actual events that happened in the mid 40s, the actors were superb, both AMERICANS & JAPANESE & IT WAS ALSO GOOD THAT THEY HAD ENGLISH SUBTITLES FOR THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE, haha..I actually watched TORA TORA TORA about 14 times in that same theater & well I was glad, when I went on the BLU RAY.COM website about 2months ago, in seeing that they had TORA TORA TORA & so, I just had to buy it online & when I saw, that it was AMAZON WEBSITE selling it & delivering like within 10 days I was a very happy chappy indeed, when I saw the package in my home letter box...yes definitely 5 star rating for the movie & 10+ rating for the BLU RAY.COM WEBSITE & FOR AMAZON WEBSITE IN DELIVERING MY PURCHASE OF THIS MOVIE, WITHIN 10DAYS...MEAN MAORI MEAN...KA PAI..
  It would be nice now, if I received a free gift from AMAZON after what I had stated all so TRUE & HONEST in my reply message to you...YEA I KNOW...DREAM ON MR.BRELL...lol..",1380672000,,1396,4.201492537313433
5099020,5,B007LNBRKQ,"Just to note:

(1)It is an urban legend that ""Tora Tora Tora"" was the code signal for an uncontested attack. The signal was ""Tora"" (Tiger). The fact that the lead pilot repeated it several times more it is irrelevant.

(2) The Japanese scenes are so horrible because they didn't use actors. The Japanese director accepted bribes in the form of investments in his next film in exchange for placing corporate CEO's in the roles of the Japanese hierarchy and if you pay attention you will notice how pathetic their non-acting is.

Still overall a very good film. Action sequences were later used also in ""Midway"".",1378339200,,610,4.79047619047619

5099026,4,B007LNBRKQ,They try to portray the attack on Pearl Harbor from both American and Japanese sides of what happened. Listen to the director's commentary some of the scenes that seem silly did happen.,1374019200,,185,4.8125
5099027,5,B007LNBRKQ,"The number of reviews from others who have much more knowledge about this film makes this review unnecessary. I do suggest you read some of them! You may find out information about this movie you didn't know and you'll enjoy the knowing. Heh, this is almost a review of the reviews huh?",1373587200,,286,4.519230769230769

5099029,5,B007LNBRKQ,This Blue Ray is rated 4.7 out of 5 for quality - anything above a 4.0 is worth buying in my book. You will enjoy this movie and it was delivered early,1371859200,,151,3.75
5099030,5,B007LNBRKQ,"I live in Hawaii, have family members who were here on December 7th and I happened to be at Pearl Harbor on business on a day when they were filming and having just returned from a tour of duty, I was looking for a place to hide when the planes flew over at tree top level and the explosions began as I could see the water erupt where the simulated charges went off.  I then saw the movie, and loved it and historically it was fairly accurate.  Yes, it wasn't perfect, but that didn't detract from history and the mistakes that were made by both sides not only here, but by the people in Washington D.C.  In my opinion Short and Kimmel were scape goats for the failings of higher command.  I have talked to survivors both civilian and military who were there that day and some of those have seen this movie and had good things to say about it.  I like history, and visit Pearl Harbor, The Arizona Memorial and the USS Utah and see the bullet riddled building at Hickam Air Force Base that serves as a reminder that we should never be caught sleeping again.  I highly recommend this movie.",1364256000,2,1088,4.3088235294117645

5099032,3,B007LNBRKQ,"I'm really sorry for Bowen's characterization of the Pearl Harbor attack as an unwarranted ""sneak attack"". In the first place, FDR manuvered (forced?) Japan into action and in the second place, I think we stopped ""warning"" the enemy of attacks in 1500 when the English kings would parlay with their opposition to decide when the ""mutual"" attack was to take place. I think we were actually very fortunate that the attack was a ""surprise"" and our ships hadn't put to sea. they would have still been sunk...but this time in 1200' of water instaed of 42'. Modern warfare is not enhanced by ""early warnings"". They would just be stupid.

And, I just ordered this Blu-Ray version since it has to be better than the original. I got ""Jaws"" in Blu-Ray and it's like looking through a window.  If ""Tora Tora, Tora"" is half as good, it must be exceptional!",1360627200,,844,4.657718120805369

5099035,4,B007LNBRKQ,"My Dad and I have seen this movie countless times. I was pleasantly surprised at its picture quality. The sound is not surround sound, however. Ir is very nice stereo. And that's fine with me. It was never conceived as to be done with Surround Sound so why should it now? All-in-all, a very good buy.",1348185600,,300,4.375

8519434,4,B007LNBRKQ,"Tora! Tora! Tora!(1970) was a box office failure at that time. On the DVD audio commentary for Our Man Flint(1966), Lee Pfeiffer jokingly claims that ""20th Century Fox made money by selling stock footage shot for Tora Tora Tora"". This was released in the same year as the WWII movie Patton. The producers hired Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku in an attempt to avoid jingoism. The English language scenes were directed by Richard Fleischer(Conan The Destroyer). Jerry Goldsmith's music score for Tora! Tora! Tora! is a masterpiece. The Imperial Japanese lost after World War II; the Attack on Pearl Harbor was an empty victory. The DVD version has a 20 minute Day of Infamy featurette. This is one of my personal favorite films.",1522281600,,728,4.926829268292683
