7876648,5,6304601905,"This is a great movie.  Dracula moves to Los Angeles under the name Vlad Tepesh.  In this story Dracula is cast in a sympathetic light as a lonely creature that is repulsed by his own vampire nature but ends up killing all the same.  Like a modern version of the classic story, he seduces Celia, the best friend of the woman he falls in love with, Kate.  Throughout the movie there is a constant power struggle going on between Vlad and his brother, Tom.  Tom has been following Vlad for centuries, making his life miserable because Vlad killed the woman he loved.  When Celia dies, Kate runs to Vlad's arms for comfort and the final battle between the brothers is decided, as well as Kate's own fate.  If you like modern vampire lore, this movie will do the trick.",1026691200,4,765,4.460431654676259

7876650,4,6304601905,"This film is not your ordinary Dracula flick. It's actually a love story with the obligatory horror scenes. The movie is indeed a so-called B-Film, yet it takes on a life of it's own. The first time I saw the film, I  couldn't believe that this cast played their roles as well as they did, and  I give everyone credit for making this film quite enjoyable, right down to  the music. One would expect to see the usual horror / Dracula film, but  aside from Bram Stoker's: Dracula and The Lost Boys, this is it for me.  From Dusk Till Dawn and Interview With A Vampire are well down on any list  I have for these types of films, but judge for yourself, and don't expect  anything other than a love story that bites...",942710400,2,714,4.2835820895522385
7876651,4,6304601905,"THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT STARTED MY VLAD FANTASIES WHEN I WAS A YOUNG GIRL. HIS IS THE ONLY FACE YOU WILL EVER WANT TO IMAGINE AS ANY VAMPIRE (DRACULA, LESTAT, ETC...) THE ACCENT IS DIVINE ALSO. QUITE AN INTERESTING MOVIE,  EXCEPT FOR THE B MOVIE GORE SCENES, A WOMAN IS CAUGHT BETWEEN A CENTURY OLD  FEUD WITH THE MAN SHE HAS FALLEN FOR, AND AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS THAT SHE  ALSO FINDS IRRESISTABLE. IF YOU CAN GET PAST THE B STATUS, YOU WILL LOVE  THIS MOVIE AS MUCH AS I HAVE AND STILL DO..... NOW THAT I CAN ADD IT TO MY  COLLECTION, AND GET RID OF THE BETAMAX TAPE THAT IT HAS BEEN ON FOREVER!!!",938736000,2,596,4.016949152542373
