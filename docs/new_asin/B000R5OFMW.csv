2858412,5,B000R5OFMW,I loved this movie it was so funny! Yes it was a mix of Beauty Shop and Barber Shop rolled in one but it also had a lot of uplifting messages. I really did want to see Terrance Howard's character a little more but the other actors really held it down. The gay guy in the Shop Dee-Dee was a trip. I loved Vivica's short hair cut it fits her well. If you haven't seen this movie get it there's a history lesson in it as well.,1191888000,,423,3.8735632183908044
2858413,5,B000R5OFMW,"You have got to rent this!!! Or better yet spread the word that this movie is out and BUY IT! I was at blockbuster and it was checked out for a minute. When i finally got it I swear the first five minutes I fell out laughin!!! It's sorta like watching ""comic view"" with a ""soul food"" esque ""beauty shop"" twist. (I won't give it away but the donut scene in the first two minutes was SOOOO FUNNY. It's the comedian that played the aunt in Next Friday.)

Why you should buy this movie? It's too funny. The prostitutes, the girl fight, it's a very good film. Most recent black movies that I've seen have been sub par for straight to video. I mean typically at film school you should learn about change of lighting and editing, and some movies get it right and some DON'T. This movie gets 95% of making a movie right. Only two or 3 scenes make you go ""huhhhh"" in the movie b/c somethign doesn't add up, buttttttt they're minor just go with it! But definitely a great movie that probably didn't get the distribution/capital it needed to hit the theaters (and yeah this one's that good)

Ummmm Vivica Fox is in it, good role for her and Darrin's dance grooves (from Soul Food t.v. show. that fine man) is in it as well. You should recognize a lot of the cast. Terrance from Hustle and Flow and Mary J. Blige ""Be Without you"" video is in it. And the girl from Gang or Roses and Sister Act 2 is in it(it was cool but it wasn't all that)
The dude that played DeDe the gay guy needs to get an award, because i was laughin' my butt off!!!

When you're done with this movie check out ""Who made the potato salad"" with Jaleel White (Urkel from Family matters. he's looking fiiinnnneee in that movie)",1189987200,4,1684,4.25625
2858414,1,B000R5OFMW,"Sorry to disappoint, but this movie sucked so bad, halfway through it I started fast forwarding through it.  Typical diaglogue with a typical plot and ending.  Barbershop and Beauty Shop redone on an ultra-low budget scale.  All those good actors gone to waste on a super-weak script.  I was hoping that they would develop the top actors' characters more, specifically Terrence Howard, being that he's such a good actor to me.  Oh well.  You win some, lose some.",1188691200,3,462,4.858974358974359
2858415,4,B000R5OFMW,"I thought the movie was pretty good. Vivica Fox's hair looked good. I've never seen her with a short haircut before. Taral Hicks was looking good. I'm glad to see she's still getting acting roles because she had disappeared for awhile after Belly movie. Monica Calhoun was looking good. I didn't like the relationship between her and Terrence Howard and the only weak thing about this movie was that Terrence wasn't shown more in the movie and him and Monica should've had more dialouge together. In one scene, he took Monica's car from her when she went to pick him up at the gas station where he worked at because he was mad at her for being late to come get him for his lunch break. I was upset that Monica wasn't given a chance to break up with Terrence and to get her car back from Terrence. R&B singer Gerald Levert had a small part in the movie. He was a customer at the salon. The scene he was in, 3 young black girls came into the shop hollering and asking him could they get his autograph. He asked them what their names were and 2 of the girls said Porscha and Mercedes. He said why do black people always name their kids after cars they can't afford? LOL. Kim Whitley was also in the movie as a hairstylist. Her and Gerald went to the same high school Shaker in Cleveland, Ohio. Kim is silly.",1187568000,5,1304,4.304878048780488
2858416,5,B000R5OFMW,"This is a very beautiful movie by wonderful characters. Each character showed himself/herself a real performer, this is why I gave it five stars. I like the honesty of the characters in performing their parts. I will recommend it to anybody.",1394582400,,241,4.902439024390244

2858420,4,B000R5OFMW,"The cast of characters in this indie, ghetto, wannabe Barbershop/Beauty Shop is ridiculous and I love it. I think it's actually ten times better than Beauty Shop. No offense Q.L.",1359504000,,178,4.966666666666667

She declines the money and decides to take on the DWP in court, all the while keeping the battle hidden from her outrageous employees and clientele.

2858423,4,B000R5OFMW,"The Salon was very great. Kym Whitley and Vivica A. Fox did a great performance. However, I felt that it could of been maybe a sequel, especially discussing what happenss with Monica Calhoun's character ordeal with her husband.

2858424,2,B000R5OFMW,Vivica Fox... is a very good actress... too bad she took this role... jokes a little funny... the fightin woman... typical... not enopugh storyline to hold a anyone's attention for too long..,1236902400,,191,5.0
2858425,2,B000R5OFMW,"This movie was just a remake of BarberShop minus the spouse.  I could go into details but all you have to do is watch Barbershop and you see the same movie.  The discussions about social issues, relationship problems, little business versus the corporate giant, even the dance scene.  It's all there.  I love the actors - especially Monica Calhoun - but this is simply a rehash of a movie from years ago.  I honestly expected better from Vivica Fox.  Not in terms of acting, but in terms of a movie to be in.",1235174400,,508,4.408602150537634

I first got wind of this movie in 2005 and heard it was better than beauty shop and hair show, well it wasnt, at least those both were original, this took bits and pieces from every black small budget movie. It was ok, but not great, nothing to rush out and buy, I'd strongly recomend renting this before buying it.",1227916800,,393,4.184210526315789

2858431,3,B000R5OFMW,I enjoyed this movie. Some funny parts. But I believe this is basically a copy of the The Barbershop and BeautyShop. We don't need another one.,1202342400,,143,4.538461538461538

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that ""The Salon"" is really just ""Barbershop"" on estrogen.  Like that earlier prototype, ""The Salon"" - which takes place in a Baltimore beauty parlor run by the beautiful Vivica A. Fox - is essentially a freeform series of conversations held together by the flimsiest of plot devices (in this one, an unfeeling bureaucracy wants to tear down the shop to make way for a parking lot).  Unfortunately, ""The Salon"" is a pretty wan imitation of the original, lacking the stinging wit and biting social commentary that made ""Barbershop"" such a crossover success in its time.

While there is a certain liveliness to the verbal jousting and a notable energy in most of the performances, the comic banter often comes across as catty and mean-spirited rather than funny and insightful. The screenplay by Mark Brown (adapted from the stage play by Shelley Garrett) works overtime trying to be clever and smart about race relations, sexual issues, and life in the African American community, but it really isn't telling us anything we haven't heard countless times before in films on those same topics.  Moreover, the characters themselves often verge on the stereotypical (with the prancing gay hair stylist as probably the most egregious and offensive example).  And to top it all off, the movie is saddled with an ending that is, perhaps, the worst case of a deus ex machina in any film in recent memory.

There are indeed some genuinely touching scenes embedded in all the brazen one-liners and zingers, and there are a few laugh-out-loud moments when the sassiness and sarcasm manage to hit the comic bull`s-eye at which the writer is aiming.  But more often than not, the humor misses its mark and falls harmlessly onto the hair-covered floor.

The actors give their all to the material and it really isn't their fault that the movie itself fails to catch fire.  Even brief appearances by Garrett Morris and Terence Howard aren`t enough to lift it out of the doldrums.

With ""The Salon,"" the ladies finally get the chance to have their say, but they're going to have to do a whole lot better than a second-rate, distaff copy of  ""Barbershop"" if they ever hope to get their message across.",1194998400,5,2237,4.8578947368421055
2858435,1,B000R5OFMW,This film watches as though the writers got together one day and numerically listed all the stereotypes we've ever heard about black communities and then  gave each one a five-minute format.
