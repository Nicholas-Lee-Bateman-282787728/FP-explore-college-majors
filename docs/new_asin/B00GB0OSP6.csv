6069023,5,B00GB0OSP6,"Yes! I remember watching this movie in the 80s at school on a rainy day. I was mesmerized by the Chipettes! I HAD to get it for my daughter! She, too, is a fan and loves the Chipmunks and Chipettes. The politics are definately 1980s, so be aware that it is dated--especially portrayals of non-hegemonic nationalities/ethnicities. BUT it is a littlegem from my childhood and certainly no worse than most anything else from that time period. It is fun, the music is fantastic, the plot is silly, so overall it is a great time. Good family movie!",1477440000,,543,4.608247422680412

6069256,5,B00GB0OSP6,"I rented this for my 3 year old to watch because I have fond memories of watching this back in the 90s with my cousins.  What I love most about this is how the villains are constantly chain smoking and drinking cocktails, no one seems upset that children/chipmunks are traveling around the world by themselves, borderline culturally insensitive scenes, and somehow hot air balloons are able to travel from Cairo to Antartica in less than 24 hrs.  With all that said you can't beat this gem of a Chipmunk Movie!

The premise is Dave is going to Europe and Alvin, of course, wants to go with him, but can't.  Dave leaves the Chipmunks back home and Alvin becomes obsessed with traveling around the world.  A wealthy diamond smuggling couple over hear Alvin's assertion that he could beat Brittany (Chippette) in a race around the world and use the Chipmunks and Chipettes to deliver what are probably blood diamonds around the world.  As you can image, chaos ensues, everyone sings, and the diamond caper is eventually discovered.

Totally wanted to be a Chippette, totally wanted to travel around the world in a hot balloon, and totally wanted to have Claudia's (villain) late 80s/early 90s chic bedroom when I was younger.  Be warned! There are depictions of smoking and drinking! There are bad guys who fight. There are culturally insensitive moments, like Looney Tunes; however, this movie is permanently engraved in my memory as one of the great movies of my childhood.  My own 3 year old would not move from where he sat until it was over.  And that is proof alone that movie desires five stars.",1447977600,,1599,4.760869565217392

The premiss may be too much for today's parent but whatever. I watched it as a kid and I'm not a diamond smuggling sociopath, so I think it will be ok.

This is not the new 3D version that's on the DisneyJunior Channel these are the old episodes put on DVD.  They are great and bring back so many memories.  The quality isn't as great as the new ones but its what we had back in the day.

If you don't get to movin' and shakin' to the Woolly Bully and some of the other Chipmunk's cover songs well you're just a stick in the mud. lol
In this movie join Alvin, Simon, and Theodore as they graduate from their weekly TV adventures to the big screen in the exciting, feature-length animated tale The Chipmunk Adventure. The three boys use a clever scheme with a tape recorder to trick their babysitter, Rebecca Miller, into letting them out of the house. The Chipmunks con the woman into believing that David Seville has granted them permission to set off on a trek around the world, in pursuit of the diamond smugglers Claudia and Claus. Of course, the boys make a point to solicit help from their female friends, The Chipettes, who excitedly agree to tag along on this globe-charting odyssey. A musical to boot, The Chipmunk Adventure features the boys singing such numbers as ""Diamond Dolls,"" and the rollicking and rousing ""Woolly Bully.""The Chipettes join in as well, with the memorable tune ""The Girls of Rock 'n' Roll.""

Dave should not be traveling for such great lengths of time while his 'wards' are clearly high needs and prone to misbehavior. Miss Miller should seek care from a doctor, she might have early onset alzheimer's given her poor ability to use context clues in her environment and retain info. Alvin has an overwhelming desire to win but nearly no skills to do so on his own. Simon is aware of his siblings thirst for victory being an issue but enables his quest with very little resistance. Theodore is often more concerned with snack foods than the people, places or things around him.

Seriously though, the plot is well done for a children's movie. I enjoyed this as a child and when I shared it with the kids I work with I was surprised by the layers in the plot.",1434412800,,811,4.510204081632653

Since the rental was good for a couple of days, I had my children watch it and my 5 year old son really enjoyed it as well as my 8 year old daugther. It's not much different from other cartoon chipmunks, but in my experience if a child likes the characters then they will pretty much watch anything with them in it.",1425945600,,482,4.08421052631579

There are also some very non PC events taking place, but that didn't bother me as much. The same language and actions wouldnt fly in todays cartoons, but it was the 80s!!!

I was beyond excited to see that this would be coming out on Blu-Ray (BLU-RAY, PEOPLE!) and immediately pre-ordered it. I have a three and a half year old daughter who I hoped would love it as much as I had (ok, still do). It is sometimes difficult to get her into movies from my childhood because of the different animation styles over the past twenty years. Luckily, the images are so vibrant and bright that it was still able to catch her attention.  It took only once for me to sit through twenty minutes with her and laugh through it for her to pick up on it. She now watches it almost every night for bed - for the past month! And every single night, she will run out to the living room, giggle, and say, ""Mom! He said, 'Woolly Bully!'"" followed by hysterical laughter.

6069575,4,B00GB0OSP6,"Forget the new CGI movies, THIS is the Chipmunk movie you and your kids should see! Based on the 80s version of the Chipmunks, this movie has a fun story, great animation (mostly from ex-Disney animators), and catchy songs.

I still come back to this movie for some of the more funnier scenes, like when the boys try to fool Miss Miller in thinking that Dave is calling, or when the Chipettes are in the Sultan's throne room.

Now, if you have the DVD, the video quality isn't that much better, sadly. The front cover says ""Digitally Restored"", and yes, I'm sure that they tried to restore it, but seems to be a bit rushed. The opening credits had more pixelation than I would like, and the line art in the opening scenes had the same. BUT, as the film went on, I can see where the restored process began to shine. The colors are brighter and the overall film is cleaner than the original DVD releases. So, this appears to be the best release of this movie so far.

Do yourself a favor and introduce your kids to this, or watch the film again and relive the good ol' 80s and all of it's childhood innocents. Such as, no country retaliation for anthropomorphic animals clearly violating their airspace with smuggled valuables.",1400025600,,1225,4.509009009009009

Although looking at now as a adult, it little corny at times; however this movie never lost its charm.",1399420800,,313,4.131147540983607

6069580,3,B00GB0OSP6,"It's sad when you buy this movie every time it comes out to have it in all video formats like myself (when I was younger, we recorded it from a movie channel, played the VHS tape out until it could play no more, then bought the newer VHS release in the mid 90s; I myself purchased the DVD years later as an adult), but this movie just never gets old.  There are so many ""moments"" in this film that every time I watch I find myself literally losing it with laughter.  From Ms. Miller's presence to Alvin's very intense and ""I'm over it"" expressions, this movie was hilarious.  And in my 30s now, I still can remember every song and line verbatim.

I thought the Blu-ray transfer was great, much clearer than the previous DVD version I had.  The only thing I didn't like about this release is that there were no real extras.  The little bonus clip that is included did nothing for me, when the last release that came out, the DVD version, included the full movie soundtrack, which was a major step up from the original VHS release which only included a bonus CD of about three songs from the movie.

It would've been nice to see a bit more as a hardcore fan of the movie, but at least there is a clearer version to enjoy for years to come!",1398816000,6,1237,4.260683760683761

6069589,4,B00GB0OSP6,"This is one of my favorite films from my childhood, and one that I still watch today even if my kids aren't around -- it's a very fun story of adventure and globe-trotting with memorable songs, humor and pathos, featuring the Chipmunks as I know them -- not the CGI versions.

I was happy to buy this movie a third time (once on VHS, then DVD, and now Blu-ray), and I hoped it would finally be widescreen (it is) and that the Blu-ray image would pop, the way Disney Blu-ray releases do.

The image does not pop. At times it is very soft and downright ugly. Other times it is clean and crisp, and I think ""this is how it should look."" But it's definitely not consistent, and it's a shame.

The backgrounds look better, but dark colors sometimes ""buzz"" with what I assume is digital noise.

All in all, I was disappointed with the transfer. So if you are considering a purchase, do it for the movie, which is great, and not the jump to high definition, which is lacking.",1395792000,16,968,4.331491712707182
6069590,5,B00GB0OSP6,"I recall watching this during my childhood and getting my the songs stuck in my head.  A random VHS cassette viewing with my children had them hooked, so naturally with the re-release of this movie, it was an easy call to make.  The animation still stands up against the current crop of other animated shows and features, but the songs are what really make this movie.  Those that appreciate The Chimpmunks in their original, hand drawn, animated look, will most certainly want to buy this for nostalgia or to introduce their own children.",1395705600,6,539,4.774193548387097
6069591,5,B00GB0OSP6,"When i found this online my heart melted. I fell in love with this movie growing up. 16 years later and i find it again. I also had the soundtrack and i would play it on loop over and over. In my opinion, this is way better than the live action movies they came out with. Its a must buy for anyone who wants to relive a cherished childhood memory.",1395705600,43,347,3.9714285714285715
6069592,5,B00GB0OSP6,"I loved this movie growing up, and today the Blu-Ray copy was delivered to my door by Amazon. I watched it with my 2-year old (who had no idea who or what a chipmunk was) and he was thoroughly entertained. The squeaky voices is what probably did him in, haha.

I didn't see any differences between the original release and the Blu-Ray version EXCEPT (and I might be wrong in remembering this) but when Jeanette gets stuck on the windmill chasing the Chipmunk doll she screeches once at the top, then opens her mouth at the bottom but no sound comes out. THIS version has her screeching a second time. I know, HUGE deal, right? I may be remembering it differently, but that's the only thing my brain was telling me I was different.

I'm glad to add this to my childrens' movie library. There is a little extra on the Blu-Ray of an old cartoon of them visiting a bull ring. It's cute, but I wish they'd added a few more extras to it.

Still worth it!",1395705600,16,948,4.314606741573034

This movie is filled with amazing music and scores. Super catchy I STILL find myself singing it on occassion. The storyline is very good, adorable and fun for a kid's movie made in the 80's. It really is a fantastic adventure following the Chipmunks and the Chipettes as they travel and race around the world!",1395360000,6,518,4.51063829787234
6069594,5,B00GB0OSP6,"Wow!  Last year I could only DREAM of a BR release, and now it is finally coming.  I'm not going to lie... This is my favorite movie ever.  Period.  I already own the DVD, but there's no way I can NOT buy the Blu-ray and miss out on the superior picture quality (hopefully)... I also have the soundtrack to the film (used to have the vinyl record as a kid many years ago) and I'll admit, I still enjoy listening to the songs every now and then.  Although there are 2(?) songs that will never grow on me, the vast majority of the music in this film is upbeat and fun and makes me wish I was a kid in the late '80s once again.  Nice idea naming this a ""Diamond Edition"". ; )  The new box art is ""ok""... not great, but I'll take it.  I find it disappointing the Chipettes are still relegated to a small part of the background, being that a huge portion of the film focuses on the adventure THEY go through!  Speaking of the box, no creepy villain eyes staring into your soul, either... although I kind of liked that (from the 2006 release).  Anyway, the movie overall is fun and definitely worth checking out, whether you're an '80s kid or just one at heart.",1395360000,,1155,4.1855203619909505

At least, I saw the Samuel Goldwyn Company opening logo for THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE on AMC and The Disney Channel in 1990's.
