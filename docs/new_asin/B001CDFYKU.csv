3510373,2,B001CDFYKU,"this movie was decent...it tries to go from Isaiah's prophecies to the Ascention in 28 minutes so the scenes are all very short so you get a decent overview but you don't get to go deep in any part of Jesus' life.  Also, there was a scene with Jesus in the wilderness when the devil comes to tempt him that is kinda intense for a child.  The devil was a very scary grim reaper type of character and my toddler acutally woke up 3 times the night after we watched it scared from the images of the devil. Animation is better than some other videos out there, but I probably won't let my child watch again till he's older and I will probably fast forward through the devil scene.",1287446400,19,675,4.224806201550388

8287129,1,B001CDFYKU,"Purchased this film from a Christian Bookstore in town. From the start, we noticed several different poses in the logo as it ""transformed"" into Peter Pan. The poses looked like poses from meditation practices from religions other than Christian. There was an ominous tone to the music that made us turn it off. We definitely feel this movie is not what it appears.",1419465600,,364,4.7936507936507935

8287133,1,B001CDFYKU,The animation was poor and Devil was not the impersive. I did not like the way the story went. If you want to watch a good movie on Chirst. watch the gospel of John.,1381363200,,165,3.8823529411764706

8287136,1,B001CDFYKU,"Quite disappointing!  The stories move so fast that it leaves out important detail from the biblical account.  The story appears to be based on a modern interpretation of the bible instead of the more classic King James version. Some important parts of the stories of the Savior are not even depicted. They use very stereotypic depictions of Satan, Judas Iscariot.  Satan reminds me of the Grinch with green skin, dagger-like finger nails and red eyes.  My 6 year old grandson even said, ""...that's not the way the bible tells the story.""  To me it doesn't matter if some children like it if it's innacurate.",1329004800,8,608,4.8076923076923075
8287137,1,B001CDFYKU,"I bought this movie for my kids and I was sorely disappointed.  It has many inaccuracies.  If you want to know the REAL story of Jesus, please read your Bible. Don't purchase this for your family.",1302825600,9,196,4.416666666666667
