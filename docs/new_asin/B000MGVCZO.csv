8169197,2,B000MGVCZO,"This particular video isn't much more instructive than, say, a lecture from an instructor without much personality.  About 80% of the visuals on screen are from a re-enactment, which gives you a sense of what the soldiers wore, but not much else.  Not a single map is ever shown, so people unfamiliar with the French and Indian War will be frequently lost.  Even assuming that this documentary was created with almost no budget (which seems to be the case), they even fail to take advantage of many materials in the public domain.

The historians interviewed are not bad, though nor are they particularly engaging.  The sole exception to this is the actor who explains the standing orders for Roger's Rangers.  His delivery of these precepts is the best part of the documentary.

A cursory look at overviews of the war from other sources reveals that there were many, many events that this documentary doesn't even touch on.  With a 55-minute running time, I suppose that the creators of this DVD had to decide if they wanted to conduct a very broad overview with few details or a compressed, incomplete overview that stops to examine a few key events in detail.  They chose the latter, which allows them to unpack a few interesting details but doesn't leave enough context for a newcomer to the subject.

The French and Indian War is possibly the most unregarded North American conflict in the modern era.  Unfortunately, this documentary does little to rectify that.",1319760000,3,1468,4.855421686746988
8169198,3,B000MGVCZO,"I will give this DVD a slightly better ratting than others because it does mention some good details despite an overall poor narration.  At 55 mins there are severe limits that anything in this series can do.  With a subject as complex as the French and Indian War of 1756 it is no wonder this documentry falls short.

Lacking any kind of maps, the action is often difficult to follow unless you are familier with the names and locales.  Even though this was done back in 1994 other titles in this series had maps.  The talking heads are light weights. Stuart Reid, with his Scots brogue is featured in a number of this series.  He is good with discussing tactics and mentions some decent details about the adaptability of British forces in this conflict.  The development of Light Infantry companies and tactics would stand the British in well in this conflict and future ones to come.

The re-enactor footage is rather weak and redundant.  The same groups are used for all the events shown.  Some of the pictures used are distinctly from later periods, most notably the American Revolution and later!  This is very sloppy and takes away from the production value.

The section dealing with Roger's Rangers is good and the re-enenactor who recites their warrior code is convincing.

Much of the story is taken up with the events at Quebec, where again a lack of any kind of maps takes away from following the action of the battle.  Still, some nice details about the regiments involved and the British platoon firing that shredded the French attack are provided.  Unforunatley little attention is paid to the second battle a few weeks later when Comte Levis takes his revenge on the British defeating them on the same field that Montcalm lost on.

Again, this is overall a weak production, but it does provide some decent details and can serve as an intro to the period.  The little quiz at the end is a cute feature.",1278979200,5,1918,4.677611940298507
8169199,2,B000MGVCZO,"I too found this film far less than comprehensive...not as good as ""The War that Made America"". However neither is excellent. Why with all the detailed DVD's and audio books about the American Revolution we cannot get a decent excellent production on the French and Indian or Seven Years War? I wish I had a few million to put together a documentary. Hell even popular films are few and far betweeen...""Last of the Mohicans"", ""North by Northwest""....doesn't anyone care about North America's first big war or the world's first World War?",1247184000,2,537,4.912087912087912
8169200,2,B000MGVCZO,"As my title has indicated, for those who are interested in the French and Indian War, the first choice is the PBS version, not this one.

This piece has the run time less than one hour, definitely not thorough enough to cover the whole story of this war. I guarantee that you cannot see the whole picture after you have finished this film. In addition, the making of this film is not so smooth, nor delightful to watch. It, however, gives a deeper analysis on certain parts of this war. For those who have been familiar with this war, this could be a bright side.

On the whole, this film could serve as a supplement, not for general-purpose use.",1182124800,23,646,4.420168067226891
