8503988,5,B006TIABTM,"I have had this for three years and have been methodically going through virtually every recipe.  It is terrific!  The variety is great and the recipes wonderful..From simple Sea bass beurre blanc or Grilled Strip steak with Chimichurri sauce to more complicated Tagliatelle Bolognese or Shepherd's Pie or Tuna Nicoise and to the more exotic Salt-encrusted trout or Duck Confit.  Also, the desserts are delicious and fun: fresh berry tart (with pate sucree) to the classic creme brle and panna cotta.  The videos are a great addition to the recipes as you can see exactly how they cut/flip/slice, etc.  Several of the chefs are quite amusing.  It was a terrific bargain at $99.00, but sadly no longer on the market...they may be selling them as individual lessons.",1424649600,2,764,4.9763779527559056

8503990,5,B006TIABTM,This was a birthday gift for my son who is just getting into experimenting with cooking. This set highlights the basics and opens up the world of food to someone who would eat take-out every day. We watch the show every season and it's nice to see the chefs when they are not competing.,1391904000,,286,4.314814814814815
8503991,5,B006TIABTM,"I'm someone who enjoys pretending to be a chef.  I had looked into several lessons around my area to hone my skills, but they are really expensive!  For example, it was going to cost $500 to take a class on knife skill basics!  I got the skills that I sought in this series!  I love the ideas, fun tips, and it has enhanced my ability in the kitchen.  I wish Grandma was still around.  I could teach her a few things.",1358208000,8,417,4.08641975308642
8503992,5,B006TIABTM,"This set is filled with fabulous recipes, The cookbook tells you which disk to use, and you see exactly what you need and how to prep and prepare...It is going to used more often than the many of cook books I own, and especially for planning special events.",1329782400,7,257,4.375
8503993,4,B006TIABTM,"First, I do love the videos they are very informative and helpful in learning how to cook better.

I have only gone through part of the videos but I love them.  This is the missing information that I wanted.  I have, already in a short time, learned so much and I am not even half way through the course.

I do have a few cons with the actual product (DVDs, cookbook) but this doesn't take away from the learning process.

Video Editing: I find that at times they edit out important steps.  A good example of this is when they julienne a carrot in introduction to knife skills. The carrot is prepped for cutting then without any explanation the carrot has been cut into planks and you are learning how to cut the carrots into matchsticks.  This is not a huge problem as you can guess how she did it.  Also the internet can provide a quick way to find the missing information.

Missing subtitles:  in their online demo of a course they show periodic pop-ups giving you tips and explaining why you are doing something.  This is sadly missing from the DVDs.

Missing Quality Assurance (QA):  The finished product feels like the QA department was napping and not checking for errors.  When looking through the cookbook the section on ""Beef, Lamb and Offal"" the introductory text reads ""This section is all about poultry and pork"".  Basically the title is correct the text is word-for-word from the previous section on poultry and pork.  There is at least one place where the DVD menu doesn't allow you to push down to get to the next lesson (hint you can press right and get to the wanted lesson)

I would gather that over time these will be corrected, ending up with a well polished finished product.

All in all it is a great product and defiantly worth the money but it does have the feeling that it was rushed out the door with little QA.",1328918400,15,1838,4.468468468468468
