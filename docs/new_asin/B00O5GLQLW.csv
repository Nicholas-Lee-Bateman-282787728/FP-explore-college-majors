8682262,3,B00O5GLQLW,"This series, while not bad (I actually like the first episode, the prelude to war, a lot) it isn't nearly as good as the 10 disk set, confusedly called ""WWII: The Complete History"" (Madacy Entertainment Group, I'm not sure which is the chicken and which the egg) provides a lot more detail and is much more ""complete."" It's still worth the money.",1520812800,,346,4.596774193548387

8682266,4,B00O5GLQLW,"This is a great collection of the whole history of WWII. Very detailed and very interesting. Plus the bonus documents that come with it is a very cool addition. Overall, great collection",1484611200,,186,4.84375
8682267,3,B00O5GLQLW,"I bought this for my 18 year old son, who is a huge fan of all things WW2.  The documentaries are very informative, without being propaganda (i.e. Victory At Sea).  He really likes the discs, which come as no surprise. Personally,  Peter Dickson, the narrator, annoys me to no end.  He constantly mispronounces words like Sah viet instead of Soh viet, Nazi as Gnat si, Espionage as Espion aj with a short a sound, and many, many others.  It literally drives me nuts to listen to him murder words.  It is something akin to ear torture.",1463529600,,534,4.510416666666667
