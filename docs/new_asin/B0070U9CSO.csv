I have used the birds video in the past and both products over excel excellent coverage of the subject matter. It held the attention of first and third graders.",1444176000,,259,4.6521739130434785
8507817,4,B0070U9CSO,"My primary class really enjoyed the excellent photography, and were able to remember a lot of interesting facts about mammals for our discussion and unit of study. Nice overview, visually engaging, and appropriate for young children.",1389571200,,233,5.5
8507818,5,B0070U9CSO,"This video has two sections. The Mammals section and a five part Reviews section. The Mammals section has a wonderful presentation of a number of animals and presentation of facts. Great for all ages. The Reviews section covers basic mammal facts to science vocabulary.

8507819,5,B0070U9CSO,"The DVD's this company puts out are great for all ages. They are very informative and colorful. I viewed it to my grandkids, gave them a quick test and hooray they all passed. The insect dvd comes with a test. I've used them in my classroom and my student's loved the dvd's. They are very educational and simple enough for everyone to understand.",1363824000,,346,4.507936507936508
8507820,5,B0070U9CSO,He's three and a half and gets up every day asking to see this. Nothing is more fun than taking him to his Grandma and Grandpas and having him tell them what a 'Ruminant' is. I don't even know what a ruminant is! Highly recommended.,1359936000,,232,4.177777777777778
8507821,5,B0070U9CSO,"These videos by Brain Food Learning are terrific. Educational and entertaining. If you are thinking of getting this video I also suggest you get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fascinating-World-of-Birds/dp/B0088L7D9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fascinating World of Birds</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fascinating-World-of-Insects/dp/B005ZV54Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fascinating World of Insects</a>, they are both outstanding. The best way I can describe these DVDs is that they take the best parts of National Geographic and Your Baby Can Read videos and put these parts together to make safe and entertaining DVDs. I don't have to worry about things being too graphic or being dumbed down. It is just the right mix. My youngest grandchild makes the sound of a lion roaring and likes imitating the elephants while watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fascinating-World-of-Mammals/dp/B0070U9CSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fascinating World of Mammals</a>. The older kids learned dolphins and bats are mammals. The introduction is great at describing mammals and how they fit into the animal kingdom. I have noticed these videos have won many awards and can't wait for any new ones to come out!",1349222400,5,1371,7.365853658536586
8507822,1,B0070U9CSO,"I was hoping for a fun close-up look at animals for my preschooler, maybe with some upbeat music and a few basic animal facts.  Instead, this is a MUCH more cranial-oriented production, with many details about a handful of animals, and complete with a ""quiz"" at the end.  Great for elementary-age kids who enjoy factoids, or parents who are homeschooling and want to incorporate this into their 3rd or 4th grade science curriculum.  Not age-appropriate for a preschooler, though, and probably very boring for anyone over 10!",1346976000,,524,5.0
8507823,5,B0070U9CSO,"WOW! This is another great DVD from BrainFood Learning!! (The Fascinating World of Insects DVD is awesome too!)! I am an elementary school teacher, and my students have enjoyed both The Fascinating World of Insects AND The Fascinating World of Mammals immensely! Both DVDs are very high-quality products- with gorgeous visuals/clarity, well-organized formats, and they both teach tons of amazing information about mammals/insects in ways that kids ENJOY!!! Great job, BrainFood Learning, and thank you for your DVDs! I look forward to your future products too!",1331942400,5,560,5.523255813953488
