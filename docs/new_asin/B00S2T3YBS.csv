6950664,5,B00S2T3YBS,"Season 5 of Wyatt Earp originally had 41 shows, which could be the record for a weekly series single season. most TV programs in the late 50's and early 60's had a standard 39 episodes. However on this DVD, only 39 edpisodes are shown,the first 2 episodes were moved to season 4 to make a standard 39 shows, since season 4 originally had 37 episodes. Not only that but there were usually only 3 one minute commercials in a 30 minute show, after the opening scene, then at the 15 minute mark and then just before the end credits, not even enough time for a bathroom break - how times have changed !
