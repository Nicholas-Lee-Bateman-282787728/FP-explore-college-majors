8298716,5,B001ELLCII,"While I was browsing Amazon one day I came across this DVD.  Being a fan of documentaries about bomb disposal, I decided to check it out.  National Archives:  The Big Picture highlights the diverse array of United States Military careers through the eyes of actual servicemen on the front lines from 1950-1975.  In this particular segment, the series takes an in-depth look into the rarely seen world of EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal), known for being arguably one of the most dangerous and deadly occupations in the military.  The film explores the origins of what would become one of the most feared weapons used in combat; explosives.  From the infamous Blitz bombing campaign of World War II to the terrifying nightmare scenario of one day having to confront a nuclear bomb.  Those daring and skilled enough to face such situations are the military's elite bomb disposal technicians known as EOD men.
  However, before an Officer or Enlisted man can join the ranks of such a select fraternity and take on such risks, they have to learn the ropes in school.  The film takes viewers on a journey with a young soldier who has decided to take on the demanding endeavor of EOD.  Training begins at the Navy's prestigious Explosive Ordinance Disposal School in Indianhead, Maryland where students from all branches of the military come to learn their craft of what will become their life's chosen work.  In the classroom, aspiring bomb techs familiarize themselves with a litany of knowledge and skills, everything from Ordinance recognition to the meticulous techniques of various and highly classified Render Safe Procedures that will save their lives and the lives of those in harm's way.  Another critical lesson plan covered on the course syllabus is the secretive render safe and disposal of nuclear weapons as well as, chemical and biological warfare agents.
  The film goes to great lengths to share with the audience as much information as possible about the EOD profession, though is careful not to reveal any sensitive render safe procedures that could potentially be used against American or Allied Forces tasked with diffusing various types of improvised devices or unexploded ordinances found on the battlefield.  After training at Indianhead is completed, a student proudly earns the right to wear the badge of an EOD technician and now can be sent out into the field to perform the tasks associated with bomb disposal work.  We ride along with the film's main character as he joins members of an elite EOD Detachment who are assigned with dealing with all types of bomb disposal duties in the field: whether its disposing of discarded rocket fuel on the coast, tracking the movements of military munitions traveling through their district or working abroad in a warzone responding to the report of an unexploded bomb.  This is the life of an EOD technician dealing with everything from the mundane to the dramatic, technicians can expect to encounter both phases of this job at any given time.
  What I found interesting about this documentary is that it takes place right around the Vietnam era.  That should give you some idea of just how primitive and outdated the techniques and tools were for the dangerous job of bomb disposal.  A lot has changed since then with the advent of ever evolving threats and new technologies to bring to the table in the form of global terrorism, the complexity of Improvised Explosive Devices and the means to counter such threats with sophisticated robots, X-ray machines and protective bomb suits.  Another interesting aspect of the bomb disposal business is that its ranks have risen to include a mixture of both government and local first responder agencies in the form of various police and fire departments that are trained to face the same dangers as their military counterparts serving here at home and abroad.  These brave men and women whom comprise this elite fraternity of experts make a formidable team.  However while the EOD profession has seen many drastic changes over the years, one thing remains constant, the unwavering skill and courage of the EOD technician.  If you're a fan of bomb disposal documentaries or the DVD series, ""Danger UXB"" this DVD is worth a look.  For me, it's nice to have a collection of films that cover both past and present eras of this honorable profession.  My hat's off to those who do this job for a living.",1311033600,6,4409,4.961904761904762
