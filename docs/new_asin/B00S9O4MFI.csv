6965189,4,B00S9O4MFI,"I expected a teen J.D. exploitation film but got a serious crime drama. A serial rapist is sought by a cop who has his own problems dealing with women. Good story with Mamie and her real-life husband (at the time) playing a divorced couple, for an inside joke.",1430524800,,260,4.4375
6965190,4,B00S9O4MFI,"Very strange, off-the-wall crime film about a serial rapist and the cynical cop who tracks him. Exploitation elements mix with a serious sub-plot involving the cop (Steve Cochran) and his wife (Fay Spain, who's excellent) in a one-of-a-kind type low budget drama. The script (co-written by Richard Matheson(!)) throws in everything including beatniks, Louis Armstrong & his All Stars who perform the title song and others, Vampira (out of drag as a beatnik poetess), and scuba diving. Cast includes Ray Danton, a cameo bit by Irish McCalla, Jackie Coogan, ""Woo Woo"" Grabowski (billed here as just Grabowski)  as a whacked out, no dialogue beatnik and of course Mamie Van Doren as a could-care-less divorcee' who gets pulled into the hunt for the rapist. And there's even Mamie's real life musician husband Ray Anthony in a cameo. The rapist is revealed right off the bat so the suspense mounts as to when and how he'll be caught. Definitely worth checking out. Olive films presents a clean, clear print and sound.",1430352000,9,1013,4.994082840236686
6965191,4,B00S9O4MFI,"This movie was entertaining and went off in some interesting and unexpected directions.  The film has exploitation elements, but also
had some interesting character development.  As long as your expectations are realistic, it's worth a look- and for those that like these kind of films it is worth a purchase",1428969600,,308,5.14
6965192,5,B00S9O4MFI,"The Beat Generation is a raunchy B Film, with Mamie Van Doren as a tough talking divorcee, who gets involved with a tough cop Steve Cochran, who is after a serial rapist. Read Mamie's book Playing The Field to find the lstory of her connection in real life with Steve Cochran. Lots of hip talk, and beatnick slang of the 1950's. Fans of Mamie will like this the most. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. A living legend and one of he last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood. I hope more of Mamie's films are released on DVD.",1428278400,12,539,4.09433962264151
8697848,2,B00S9O4MFI,"The long lost term melodrama comes to mind.

Bad script and superficial actors make this a must miss.

This is a clueless Hollywood take on a subject they know nothing about.",1525392000,,174,4.580645161290323
8697849,3,B00S9O4MFI,"This is really more of a police drama then a movie about the Beat Generation who when shown are portrayed though the media stereotype of the Beatniks.  Here are the pros and cons as I see it:
Pros:
1.  Louis Armstrong is in this film several times which was a nice surprise.
2.  Interesting how they talk about and portray several controversial subjects such as abortion due to rape, unwanted child, domestic violence, media stereotype of Beatniks, and the lack of sensitivity shown to women that were victims of rape.
3.  Underwater scenes of SCUBA are interesting, but that might just be my bias as I am a diver.
Cons:
1.  I actually bought this film to see Maila Nurmi (Vampira) but she was only in the film a short while reading poetry as a Beatnik.
2.  WARNING:  If you are sensitive to films dealing with the subject of rape, I would not advise this film.",1519430400,2,861,4.480769230769231

8697851,4,B00S9O4MFI,"this movie opened well but then turned into an ordinary police drama.  It did have some hysterical ""beat"" dialogue and a rare appearance by Maila Nurmi who was Vampira on television and in the infamous Ed Wood classic Plan 9 From Outer Space. (without her Vampira make-up).  It also features LOUIS ARMSTRONG if you can believe that!  Not bad.",1485907200,,342,4.762711864406779

8697855,4,B00S9O4MFI,"OK late 50's crime/beatnik thriller.  A cop is on the trail of a serial rapist who even raped the cop's wife.  You get the feeling, at first, that the detective is only doing this because it's his job.  He doesn't have a high opinion of women because his former wife ran around on him and it is clear he doesn't quite trust his present wife.  I think he even wonders if she welcomed the rapist's attentions.  The investigation centers at a beatnik caf.  Wait till you hear their music and poetry readings.  The highpoint (or lowpoint) is when Maxie Rosenbloom collars Steve Cochran for an impromptu and unwelcome wrestling match.  You get the feeling Cochran wishes himself a million miles away.  The true highpoint is when the detectives have to go to the local lovers' lane to catch a murderous mugger.  The sight of Sid Melton and Jackie Coogan in drag is a sight never to be forgotten.  Entertaining mishmash also co-stars Mamie Van Doren, Ray Anthony, Jim Mitchum (Robert's son), Fay Spain, Irish McCalla, Vampira, and a slew of others.  The Olive DVD release has no extras but is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1438473600,3,1125,4.737113402061856
8697856,4,B00S9O4MFI,"Im a sucker for movies made during certain fads of the past. It doesnt matter if its the roaring twenties, the hippie movement of the sixties or the beat generation as found in this movie. What becomes fascinating in watching these movies is that they capture a moment in history that will forever be there to watch on film (or in this case disc) for everyone to see.

THE BEAT GENERATION opens with a group of beatniks listening to of all people Louis Armstrong. How and why he ended up here Ill never know. We get to meet Stan Hess (Ray Danton), the drifting son of a well to do father on his fourth marriage. There is no love lost between father and son and it becomes apparent that this conflict is what drives Stan when the next time we see him he is posing as someone else, pretending he owes money to a womans husband who is away on a business trip. In reality what he is there for is to con his way into her house and then brutalize and rape her. Keep in mind this movie was made in 1959 so the term rape is never mentioned but is painfully obvious, especially later.

As Stan is making his way home he hitches a ride with a driver who turns out to be Dave Culloran (Steve Cochran), a local police detective. The two strike up a conversation, Dave lets him know where he lives and drops him off at what he thinks is Stans house. Of course it turns out that Dave is the detective assigned to the case. Daves partner Jake (Jackie Coogan) lets his partner know that he seems to have a problem with women, due mostly to past experiences Dave has had. But now with a loving wife at home, Jake suggest he take it easy on the victims rather than press them for information.

We get a glimpse of Daves home life with Francee (Fay Spain), his doting wife. As he asks her about her day it becomes obvious that he has a hard time leaving work at the office. His conversation with her sounds more like an interrogation and she calls him on it. Swearing to back off he shows her more affection and steps back on his way of talking to her.

That all gets turned upside down when Dave gets a call from Stan telling him that hell turn himself in if Dave meets him at a local beatnik club. While Dave and Jake wait for him to show, Stan shows up at Daves house and Francee turns into his next victim. Blaming himself for this, Dave swears he will catch Stan if its the last thing he does.

Most of the movie then plays out as a detective story with one exception. Francee ends up being pregnant. Alluding to the possibility earlier to Jakes wife, she now wonders if this is Daves child or the rapists. In talking with Dave about it she knows he could never accept the child as his own and decides she wants to abort the child without Daves consent. This becomes the secondary story in the film, a taboo topic that gets an adult look at the problem I doubt most films from the time dealt with.

Is this a great movie? Perhaps not but it is an entertaining one, more so than I expected. The discussion of the themes in the film seem far ahead of their time coming from 1959. Its more serious than some would have been and yet deals with it on both and emotional and moral grounds. Maybe its my nave way of looking at film from the period but I honestly cant think of many movies dealing with these issues short of the scandal scare flicks used to caution teens.

The acting here isn't Oscar worthy but holds up fairly well. This is the second film Ive seen Cochran in lately (THE BIG OPERATOR being the other) and Im surprised he didn't become more well-known. He does a solid job in the roles he plays and turns in a great performance. While Danton may have been the biggest name in the picture his performance is hampered only by the dialogue hes given to speak. With a ton of beatnik slang tossed in for his character everything from daddy-o to an overuse of the word man comes from him non-stop. Also seen is James Mitchum, son of Robert Mitchum, in only his third movie as Stans best friend and cohort in crime. Prominent in the ads for the movie is Mamie Van Doren who actually has a small role here but whose presence made it a must for teens.

As I said the most interesting part about movies like this is getting a glimpse of what life was like at the time it came out. It becomes as much a history lesson as it does an entertaining movie. Some might think of the film as quaint, a bit of fluff that barely covers the complex issues at hand. But as Ive said before when watching movies from years ago the best way to understand them is to put yourself in the position of the audience of the time rather than how things are today. When you do that with a movie like this one it becomes shocking on a whole different level. Today it would merit a movie on Lifetime but then it was a controversial topic. In the end if you like movies that display the more recent past then you might want to pick this one up for your collection. While there are no extras to talk about, Olive Films has done a great transfer to blu-ray on this one.",1431043200,6,5027,4.218295218295219
