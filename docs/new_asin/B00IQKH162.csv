It follows the adventures of El Santos, La Tetona Mendoza and El Peyote Asesino ,enduring characters that have been present in Mexico's  newspaper strips for almost two decades. Here El Santos and his faithful Cabo fight the horrendous Zombies de Saguayo, while trying to lure the heinous yet incredible attractive Tetona Mendoza. If you want to see a crazy movie that has no explanation but laughs, Mexican puns and daily life (the scene where Rata Maruca describes the male prisoners how they will be punished for not changing the toilet paper or peeing outside the toilet is just hilarious) this is the perfect one! The soundtrack is also another reason to watch this head scratching movie.",1401321600,4,774,4.863636363636363
