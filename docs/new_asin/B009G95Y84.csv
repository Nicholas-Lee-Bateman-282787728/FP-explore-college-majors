8541140,1,B009G95Y84,"The episodes here are fantastic and mostly complete. I bought it for Hank Williams Jr,  and he never disappoints. But beware.....these are DVD-R discs, not authentic authorized releases. Also, I had a first copy and then a replacement copy, and neither would play past the first eight minutes on the last episode. My suggestion;  find this footage elsewhere.",1426291200,,358,5.155172413793103
