7867475,3,6304277504,"1.) King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Ahmed Johnson vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley w/Chyna

Okay opening bout that sees Helmsley get the win with a Pedigree on Ahmed, following a distraction from Chyna

2.) King of the Ring Semi-Finals: Mankind vs Jerry the King Lawler

We get an in-ring pre-match promo from Mankind, where we get to here McMahon's classic laugh. Lawler is out next and cuts his usual comical insults on the crowd. The match was pretty good and goes for about 10 minutes. I enjoyed it and thought it was a fun match. Mankind advances to the finals after putting out Lawler with the Mandible Claw

3.) Crush w/D'Lo Brown and Clarence Mason vs Goldust w/Marlena

Slow, boring, and pointless match. Goldust wins with a DDT on Crush and that's that

4.) The Hart Foundation (Owen Hart, British Bulldog, and Jim Neidhart) vs The Legion of Doom and Sycho Sid

This was a fun and decent match that I enjoyed watching; as I feel many 6 Man Tag Team matches were a treat to watch back in the day. A few sloppy points here and there but it doesn't effect the overall performance and outcome of the match. Owen gets the win after a sunset flip pin on Sycho Sid off the turnbuckle. Unfortunately this marked Sycho Sid's last PPV in WWF as he was fired shortly after

5.) King of the Ring Finals: Mankind vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley w/Chyna

In the finals of the 1997 King of the Ring tournament, we're treated to an all back and forth classic bout and what some consider one of the best King of the Ring matches of all time, as Helmsley and Mankind battle out for the right to wear the prestigious crown. Of course, there was plenty of interference from Chyna to go along with the match. Helmsley comes out the winner, following a Pedigree on Mankind. I don't think many expected Helmsley to win, as according to many, Helmsley wasn't in WWF's good graces for a good while following the infamous 1996 Curtain Incident.

6.) Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Shawn Michaels

Prior to this match, we got a decent heel promo from Bret Hart, before he and The Hart Foundation tried to hijack the commentary table before getting tossed out by officials. Brilliant match between arguably the 2 most popular starts of the WWF in 1997. Austin's t-shirts had been selling like hotcakes following his bout with Bret Hart at Wrestlemania 13 and Michaels of course was still doing fine in the merchandise department, as he had been since late 1995/early 1996. This was pretty much a Grudge Match to be settled and it delivered as a nice variety of styles in a very chaotic way. The match ends on a disappointing Double DQ after Earl Hebner comes out and disqualifies both Austin and HBK for assaulting previous officials in the match. They'd go on to have a more classic battle the following year at Wrestlemania 14

7.) WWF Championship Match: Faarooq w/The Nation of Domination vs The Undertaker (c) w/Paul Bearer

Faarooq's forgotten 13 minutes of fame begin. After the Cold Day In Hell PPV, the WWF began pushing Faarooq towards the main event. At the same time, The Undertaker had realigned himself with Paul Bearer as part of a greater storyline that would consume most of Undertaker's career for most of 1997 and 1998 (most of you know what feud it is). It was honestly kind of weird to see this match. Undertaker went from battling people like Sycho Sid and Stone Cold Steve Austin to.......Faarooq? The Undertaker undoubtedly went into this match as the underdog. Not only was the entire Nation against him, McMahon and J.R. played up the secret Paul Bearer had about Undertaker and hyped that he'd tell the secret if Undertaker lost the belt. Even though the odds were stacked against The Deadman, he retains the title with a Tombstone on Faarooq, after the Faarooq was distracted by The Nation arguing on the outside. Following the match, Paul Bearer orders Undertaker to give Faarooq 3 Chokeslams, which oddly enough brings out Ahmed Johnson who tries to bring Taker to his senses with a Pearl River Plunge. This match really served no purpose other than to continue the storyline between Undertaker and Paul Bearer. His feud with Faarooq ended shortly after and no one even remembered the Nation leader's one time main event match

Overall: Not a great King of the Ring PPV. Maybe decent at best. The only match worth your while to watch is HHH vs Mankind and maybe Michaels vs Austin. The 6 Man Tag Match is a good one to watch as well. Everything else barely passes as watchable. KOTR 1997 gets a 3/5 stars from me",1401753600,,5117,5.340796019900497
7867476,2,6304277504,"Thanks to an old tape in my wrestling collection, I relived another event from 1997. During this time, The Undertaker was the WWF Champion who was involved in a feud with the Nation of Domination while at the same time, was being blackmailed by Paul Bearer. Also, Stone Cold Steve Austin & Shawn Michaels had won the tag team titles from the Hart Foundation but they couldn't get along no matter what to the point that they agreed to face each other. However, one highlight about this event that stands out was the beginning of the rise of a man that would become a multiple time World Champion & be referred to as The Game.

KOTR Semi Finals: Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs Ahmed Johnson. The first of two semi final matches but this one was more of a showcase for Ahmed as he overpowered Hunter throughout this match before Chyna was able to distract him long enough for Hunter to get the victory.

KOTR Semi Finals: Mankind vs Jerry Lawler. This was the second match of the tournament as the storytelling here was that Lawler was focusing on Mankind's neck to the point where Mankind took a piledriver on the floor that really had an effect on the match before Mankind withstood the punishment to qualify into the finals.

Normally, I don't mention backstage skits but this was the part where Brian Pillman was being interviewed before being attacked by Stone Cold Steve Austin that lead to him puttin Pillman's head in the toilet. This was really hilarious & a classic moment in itself.

Goldust vs Crush. This was just a filler match that was really ""just there"" & boring for the most part as it was just to continue the problems among the Nation members.

Owen Hart, The British Bulldog & Jim Neidhart vs Legion of Doom & Sycho Sid. This was Sid's last WWF match in what was a good six man tag as all six men worked well together along with this being the first match of the night that the crowd got heavily into it. There were a few botches here & there but nothing that really ruined the match as it also helped set the stage for the Canadian Stampede main event.

KOTR Finals: Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs Mankind. This was the most memorable moment of the night as this was the most aggressive that we had seen Triple H up to this point as he was relentlessly attacking Mankind's neck to take advantage of what happened during the earlier match. Foley took a beating here as he was pedigreed through the announce table, hit over the back of his head with a scepter at the hands of Chyna & was even attacked with the crown by Hunter after Hunter had already won the match & become the 1997 King of the Ring.

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Shawn Michaels. Well since these two couldn't get along despite being the tag team champions, they battled here in what was an awesome wrestling match & my favorite encounter between these two that is overshadowed by their future WrestleMania encounter. They put on a 30 min. performance with Austin relying on his power & roughneck style while Shawn was able to use his speed & quickness with a great story being told here as both men tried to top the other, even when it came to the ending of both men trying to prove who was the more ""anti-authority"" out of the two.

WWF Champion The Undertaker vs Faarooq. This was one of those matches where the bigger issue was continuing both men's respectative storylines as the Nation seemed to be falling apart with Crush & Savio being at words along with Paul Bearer constantly yelling at Taker to do what he wanted to say. Now about the match itself, Taker brought out a better effort than expected from Ron Simmons...I mean Faarooq. It was a good main event & one of Faarooq's best single matches during his WWF run but was easily Taker's weakest title defense during this reign. The aftermath featured Ahmed Johnson confronting & eventually attacking Undertaker to set up their title match at Canadian Stampede...that didn't happen due to Ahmed getting injured & Vader taking his place (Thank God).

Overall, this was one of those events that really only had two matches worth going out of your way to see which were Austin/HBK & Hunter/Mankind but both of those matches have already been released on DVD so if you can find this for a cheap price, then I recommend to give it a look but other than that, you can pass as the best matches on the card are available elsewhere.",1232323200,,4358,4.520304568527918

Semi-Final Match In The King Of The Ring Tournament:

Ahmed Johnson V. Hunter Hearst Helmsley

Horrible opener that couldn't have been any worst if Hogan was in it. Ahmed is only a shell of his old self. Triple H wins in a 100% DUD

Semi-Final Match in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Mankind V. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler

Another horrible match that is somewhat watchable because of Foley's bumps. Mankind wins. *

Crush V. Goldust

Why the hell is this on the card? Can you say ""Pointless Filler""? Horrible match will no real action. Goldust wins. 3/4*

Legion Of Doom & Psycho Sid

V.

Owen Hart, Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart, & British Bulldog

At least this was a ok match. Some good action and this is actually Sid's last WWF Pay-Per-View. The Hart Foundation Win. **1/2 (Personal Note: I never really liked Sid as a in-ring performer. I always thought that most of his matches were pretty dull. However, I have always loved Sid's interviews and that's why I liked Sid. Sid was probably the best promo guy in the business of a time there)

Finals in the King Of The Ring Tournament:

Mankind V. Hunter Hearst Helmsley

Pretty boring until the last ten minutes or so. It got really exciting and Triple H is the 1997 King Of The Ring! However with a very boring start and middle the rating will still be pretty low. Say a...**1/4

Stone Cold Steve Austin V. Shawn Michaels

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome wrestling match. My favorite match in 1997 and should have won match of the year but the Hell In The Cell match won it. Awesome wrestling back and forth and if there would have been a clean finish (it ending in a Double Disqualification) this would be a five star match. However because of the cheap ending I will give it a ****3/4. Awesome match. I really do recommend seeing it.

WWF Championship:

Undertaker (Champion) V. Faarooq

Why the hell is Undie wrestling a midcarder for the richest prize of them all? I don't get it. No wonder why WCW was kicking Vince's ass for two years. This match was horrible and had very little action. Undie wins. *3/4 After the match Ahmed comes down and beats up Undie to set up the WWF Title match at Canadian Stampede. What the hell? Another midcarder. Oh well, Ahmed would hurt his knee again and Vader would take his place.

Overall, a very boring show. However, the final ten minutes of the tournament final was great and the Austin/Michaels match was better than their WrestleMania match.",1130630400,,2521,4.588366890380313
