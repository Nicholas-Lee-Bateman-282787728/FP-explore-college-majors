8376510,5,B002OW3YZK,"After stumbling upon Brian Darwas' first film ""The Road to Bonneville"" I was eager to see what other movies he made. I've heard about ""The Devil at Your Feet"", and when I find out who made it I just had t see it, and I'm sure glad that I did.

The Devil at Your Feet studies two hot rod clubs from both The East and The West Coast, it's an age old rivalry that finally comes to a head.  This film lets you know that it's not so much about where you're from, but what your values are when it comes to traditional hot rods.

There is a lot of history to be learned from this film, and lots of excitement to be had watching handmade hot rods tear through the streets.  We get to see the cars and meet the men who built them.

This is another Hot Rod movie that is sure to spend more time on your TV than in it's case on the shelf.  I was throughly satisfied and recomend this movie to anyone who is serious about cars.",1290643200,5,915,3.9726775956284155
