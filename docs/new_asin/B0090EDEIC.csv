5200422,3,B0090EDEIC,"The only thing I can think of when it comes to Christmas movies that could be better than ones about killers dressed in Santa Claus outfits are disaster films centered around the holiday. I don't know if it's just coincidence or if Anchor Bay Home Entertainment is trying to start a new tradition, but last Christmas they gave us ""Ice Quake"" and now this year we get the gift of ""Snowmageddon."" SyFy Channel does deserve some of the credit for these entertaining low-budget time-wasters since they originally aired there first.

Christmas Eve in Normal, Alaska is anything but its namesake when a string of seemingly natural disasters occur. The tiny town's residents find themselves running for their lives from bizarre earthquakes, fiery explosions, meteoric ice, and protruding underground spikes. Could a mysterious cursed snow globe be the cause of all the mayhem?

""Snowmageddon"" is glorious disaster-film fun for everyone who enjoys B-movies made on a one-shoestring budget. This has everything you could ever want in this sort of film and more. The CGI and special effects are maybe two steps above what we've come to expect from C-grade Asylum movies.

Filmmakers definitely know what they need to do to attract a good mix of genre fans for projects like these. Magda Apanowicz (""Caprica"") does an incredible job of running around while screaming and crying. Michael Hogan (""Battlestar Galactica"") trades in his eye-patch for a tool smock in the role of a wise old antique dealer. Laura Harris (""Dead Like Me"") and David Cubitt (""Medium"") play the parents of the little boy (Dylan Matzke, ""Criminal Minds"") who finds the mysterious snow globe.

One thing I find interesting about these particular SyFy Channel movies is their family-oriented tone. Both ""ice Quake"" and ""Snowmageddon"" are aimed at an ""all ages"" audience. Besides a few scenes with blood, there's nothing too gory about it. They also center around families trying to save each other while staying united during incredible events.

The Blu-ray version of the movie comes with no extra features. Many times Anchor Bay will at least throw a simple ""Making of"" featurette and trailer on the disc just to give it something they can promote as bonus material. I love watching the ""Behind-the-Scenes"" clips for low-budget movies like these. I find it fascinating to get to see the type of conditions they had to film under.

""Snowmageddon"" gives disaster film enthusiasts something to watch over the Christmas holidays. The ""cursed snow globe"" is a unique fantasy element we don't get often with these types of movies. The lack of any real gore and graphic violence also makes it easier to watch with family and friends when you run out of other seasonal activities or just need a little downtime.",1356912000,,2764,5.037199124726477

5200424,2,B0090EDEIC,There is absolutely nothing to suggest that a snow globe has anything to do with the world around it but that is exactly what is suggested in this film.  The plot is weak and so are the special effects which lack realism. It was something that I might be able to sit through on ad-supported TV but not something that I would pay to watch... which I did.  It was not worth the money I paid to watch it.,1354060800,,401,4.063291139240507

The local sheriff, his pilot wife and their two kids must figure out why it is happening. Could it be the mysterious gift that was left on their doorstep on Christmas Eve? Their son has the sneaky suspicion that it is.

Brought to you by the Executive Producers of Ice Quake, Mega Cyclone, Mongolian Death Worm and Stonehenge Apocalypse; Snowmaggedon-despite what everyone else has to say- is a pretty decent movie. I'll admit, the title is abit misleading(as the movie doesn't really have anything to do with end of the world stuff). However, for a SyFy Original, it kept me entertained until the end. This makes the second SyFy Original that I've purchased and twice I've liked the movies...so, at least, we know that SyFy is getting better at these wild movies(sometimes the plots are wayyy out there, lol) they put out there.

I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but not every movie that's made can be a billion dollar blockbuster. Snowmageddon ain't as bad as people let on. I really liked it myself and think they ought to make a part two. Seriously.

For its' asking price, Snowmageddon is worthy of a purchase.",1353974400,12,1252,4.76036866359447
5200426,2,B0090EDEIC,"****MINI-PLOT SPOILERS?*****

It is hard to spoiler the plot of a production of this SyFy caliber. The movie opens with ominous music as a gift is placed on the doorstep of the Miller family during Christmas season in Normal, Alaska. It reminded me a bit of the beginning of ""Evil Toons"" but without porn stars. But I soon discovered one does not have to be a porn star to be a bad actor. If you missed the films, ""Earthquake,"" ""Avalanche"" ""Jumanji,"" ""Volcano,"" ""Ice Age 2012,"" and ""ROTK"" you are in for a real treat.

The gift is opened by ""Dragon of the Crown"" player Rudy (Dylan Matzke) the young boy. It contains a snow globe that contains a detailed replica of the town. Within about 10  minutes you will figure out whatever happens inside the evil snow globe, happens to this now isolated town. The question is who left it and why, something guessed at, but never fully explained.

Meanwhile the world's greatest snowboarder, Derrick Reed (Jeffrey Ballard) charters a helicopter with Beth Miller, (Laura Harris) the mom, who brings along her impressionable, slightly flirty teenage daughter Jennifer (Magda Apanowicz). It seems in December in Alaska it is hard to find a place to go snowboarding so champions charter helicopters to take them to mountain peaks.

During the course of the film the town is attacked by earthquake, avalanche, exploding ice storm, stalagmites, and a volcano. The armies of Mordor can be defeated once The Ring is cast into the fire of Mt. Doom.

What this film teaches us:

1.) If a Christmas gift is heavy, it's fruitcake.
2.) Game expansion sets make for stocking stuffers.
3.) If the dog barks at the gift, it is bad.
4.) Flirting is worse than ogling.
5.) Having a snow boarder autograph your arm is the best Christmas ever.

While adults will have problems watching the film because of the simplistic plot, bad acting, and CG effects, I can imagine tween kids or younger possibly enjoying the film.

5200472,4,B0090EDEIC,"It's Christmas Eve in Abnormal Alaska.  A mysterious nobody drops an evil gift on the door stoop of an average family of four.  It's a snow globe, one of the more deadly of Christmas decorations.  Of its own accord, it starts wrecking havoc on the small community.  Disasters pop up with clockwork regularity, some worse than others.  People die (mostly off screen, lessening the impact and confirmation that they did indeed die instead of just reaching the end of their small part in this plot).  At least the dog doesn't die.

The CGI is limited, but I'm come to expect that from the Syfy Channel.  And in some respect, have come to count on it.  These dopey stories wouldn't be nearly as much fun were they up to par with most sci-fi adventures of note.  It's their unrelenting ineptitude that makes them unique and watchable.

5200486,3,B0090EDEIC,"The bad things first. This movie seems to have been made to show that creepy things also happen during holidays...the supernatural doesn't take a vacation just because it's Christmas Eve.  The characters are stock ones...the local sheriff, his plucky wife, their two pluckier kids, the best friend, the troublemaking townsman, etc.  My main question is: Why?  Why is all this happening? There's never an explanation as to why armageddon comes in the form of a mysterious snowglobe in which whatever happens inside the globe also happens to the little town. Who sent it? Nothing ever shows up to claim responsibility. Why pick the sheriff and his family as the recipients? One keeps expecting there to be a tie-in to the board game the son is playing but it never happens except in offering a solution to the problem.

The halfway good and bad: As in most ""disaster"" movies, the events are the stars and even those aren't so wholesale destructive.  We see no bodies or body parts strewn around. There's a surprising lack of emotion for those killed. The best friend dies, he rates one line of euology. The nominal love interest gets it, the would-be girlfriend screams, then he's never mentioned again. Ho-hum.

The good: The characters are low-key and don't chew the scenery, of which there is a beautiful abundance...snow, greenery and mountains. (Query: can there be that much green on the ground when it's winter in Alaska?) The violence is relatively mild as mentioned previously. Familiar faces and good acting abound.

Rather than have the damage result from some human trespass against nature, SNOWMAGEDDON goes a much different route than most other films of its kind and molds the tale after the story of Pandora's box from Greek mythology. This is as original as it is confusing and utterly pointless, when most are just tuning in to watch the people dying as things explode on screen. Both the special effects and acting are adequate for the budget. ICE TWISTERS fans had better prepare for another deadly winter!

8533208,4,B0090EDEIC,"I don't know why I liked this one. it had nothing terrific about it, but maybe the way it was all put together. a hard to believe story with just a little bit of maybe average special effects; decent acting; or maybe the pacing because there was something happening at every moment regardless of how silly it might be............it was watchable.  yes...i'd buy it again!",1511740800,2,371,4.707692307692308
