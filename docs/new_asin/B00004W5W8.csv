7924973,5,B00004W5W8,"This movie is a complete kung fu movie. What I mean is this movie has a great plot, story and over the top kung fu. Starring Simon Yuen Siu Tien aka Sam seed the Drunken Master, Yuen Cheung Yan aka (the guy who directed the kung fu for Charlies Angels) and David Chiang the Shaw Brothers superstar. Corey Yuen, who has directed many of Jet Li's movies also helps supply the action in this as well. David Chaing plays a police cheif investigating a rougue gang. Simon Yuen plays Chaings girlfiends father. When one of the gang members is being hidden out on Simon Yuens land and the gang gets wind of it, Watch OUT!! It's an all out brawl. There is alot more to this movie but just get it and see for yourself why the Yuen Clan always creates great movies!!",978566400,5,756,4.293706293706293
