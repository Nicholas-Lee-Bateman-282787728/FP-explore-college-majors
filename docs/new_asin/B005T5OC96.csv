4888124,3,B005T5OC96,The information on this DVD is to me somewhat controversial. It did propel me to do more research. I am doing a research paper on Living to 100 and this information was somewhat helpful.,1395878400,,186,4.5
4888125,5,B005T5OC96,"After reading the book twice, i watched the video and found that it complimented the book. I liked Dr. Lodge's presentation. I picked up additional information from watching it. I found it motivating! Highly reccomend to anyone interested in understanding how their body works and in improving their health. I have changed my workouts to include an hour of cardio four times a week and lift weights two days a week.",1395792000,3,415,4.859154929577465
4888126,5,B005T5OC96,The information is excellent and given in a humorous manner that makes it an enjoyment to read. Great for retirement health planning.,1391299200,,133,5.090909090909091
4888127,5,B005T5OC96,"Common sense backed up with scientific knowledge and it is easy to understand.  I  bought the book also, in fact bought extras to pass around.",1372550400,4,142,4.64
4888128,5,B005T5OC96,"Lots of good things to stay healthy, or get healthy. I will send it on to a friend or relative to share in this valuable info.",1364428800,,126,3.8846153846153846
4888129,4,B005T5OC96,"I had already read the book (2 versions actually) and wanted the DVD specifically to share with a friend who probably wouldn't read the book, plus as a quick reminder of the many important items of health. The things the books and DVD about healthy aging and just plain healthy living are no-nonsense, easy-to-understand facts. It's a good book to keep around and refer to at least once a year.",1329609600,28,394,4.642857142857143
8485855,5,B005T5OC96,I found this dvd and bonus features very interesting. Fascinating! Highly recommended. Gives ine hope.,1522713600,,102,5.866666666666666
8485856,5,B005T5OC96,"I wish everyone could see this DVD. It is superb! In these times of health care crisis we need to look at ways to stay in good health. Dr. Lodge most certainly has some answers and the science to back up what he says. If the entire country followed this plan, and exercised an hour each day and ate a plant based diet, health care costs would plummet. And........... It also shows the real potential of being fit, healthy and vital into very old age. Let's just say I am doing it, and I am getting great results! Buy it! Watch it! Share it!",1488240000,,540,4.201923076923077
8485857,2,B005T5OC96,"It's not their fault, but I thought this was a CD we could listen to in the car on road trips! Bummer.",1476057600,,102,3.6818181818181817
8485858,3,B005T5OC96,"It's not exactly like the book. The book is infinitely better in terms of telling you why you need to rigorously exercise and what to do. Just watching this video will probably not motivate you enough to work out as hard as the direction implied by the book.  This DVD is like an infomercial. It's a good introduction to the issue, but if you want to know what to do and how much to do, you have to read the original book.",1443225600,2,422,4.146341463414634
8485859,5,B005T5OC96,"I think everyone should read the book Younger Next Year.  But if you aren't into reading an entire book, this is a very good option.  An important message that everyone should hear.",1441756800,,181,4.625
8485860,5,B005T5OC96,Not everyone understands the science.  That is the reason this book is worth reading.,1427500800,,85,5.071428571428571
8485861,1,B005T5OC96,A nice Public Relations commercial for the other Younger Next Year products.  Even less science than the original book.  J Gail Ph. D. PA-C,1413244800,3,139,4.75
8485862,5,B005T5OC96,This will change your perceptions about exercise and its benefits.  Have purchased it to loan to friends and family.,1411430400,,116,5.105263157894737
8485863,5,B005T5OC96,"Dr Henry Lodge is the real deal! Great information that we all should listen to. If you haven't read ""Younger Next Year"", I highly recommend it.",1409875200,,144,4.576923076923077
8485864,5,B005T5OC96,"Instead of ""Trojan Horse,"" this review could say that your body's ""message molecules"" are your body's ""conscience.""  But ""Trojan Horse"" is chosen, to illustrate that unknown to you, and if you make certain choices, wrongful choices for your body will be chemically ""subverted from within.""

Your own body is a potential Trojan Horse if you are sedentary, and particularly if you are sedentary and elderly - a double whammy.

LOCUS OF CONTROL: You may believe that when you (probably by default) chose a sedentary lifestyle, you are exercising ""locus of control"" over your own body.  But you are not.  When you engage in a sedentary lifestyle, you trigger your own body's biological ""default"" mechanism, which is set on biological decay - a sort of compulsory physiological deterioration - which is communicated throughout your body by messenger molecules secreted into your bloodstream.  If sedentary, ""locus of control"" passes from your conscious thoughts to your body's biological default mechanism.

Your body's Trojan Horse is your body's messenger molecules which communicate ""decay"" messages.  If your body's messenger molecules communicate ""growth"" messages throughout your body, your messenger molecules are not acting as a Trojan Horse.

Trojan Horse decay is not NATURAL ""aging,"" it's a result of your own choice, to lead a sedentary lifestyle.  You can avoid triggering your body's biological default mechanism by engaging in a physical active lifestyle, by remaining in motion by regularly exercising your muscles - and (everyone please note) your muscles are where your body's ""messenger molecules"" are secreted into your bloodstream and carried throughout your body.

The converse to the molecular message of decay is the positive molecular message of growth, which signals to your body that you are physically active - your choice.

This DVD's subtitle is ""The New Science of Aging.""  This ""new science"" involves new biologic knowledge - many Nobel Prizes awarded in this field - concerning ""molecular messaging"" within your body, and that much of ""aging"" is neither ""natural"" nor inevitable, but is the direct result of your own choices.  You can make the positive ""choice"" to remain physically active, and postpone or even reverse the supposed ""aging"" process, to become ""Younger Next Year!""

This DVD's message is that physiological decay, which most people regard as normal ""aging,"" can be halted and even reversed if people take charge of their lives and control their own physiological destiny by physical exercise - the more, the better, and sooner rather than later.

This DVD's speaker emphasizes that ""it is never too late"" - at ANY age - to abandon a sedentary lifestyle, and to halt and even reverse the physiological process of decay by engaging in regular physical exercise, thereby enhancing the quality of one's life, to become ""Younger Next Year.""

Captivating and entertaining speaker; great humor!",1396828800,6,2931,5.323210412147505
