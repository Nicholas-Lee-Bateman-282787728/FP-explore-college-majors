1386418,5,B000050XQO,"For those of us who have seen some or all of Survivor, this DVD allows us to relive what was a truly unique, unexpected phenomenon.  And though this DVD may not bear limitless repeat viewings, it is something I certainly enjoyed viewing in its entirety, and will perhaps again in the years ahead.
However, for those who have NOT seen Survivor, what an opportunity this is to witness the series for the very first time!  The drama builds quite nicely without commercial interruption, and rather than waiting seven days between each episode, you can go at your own pace.
The extras are nice, though I wish they had added still more unused footage.  Given the unbelievable amounts of footage CBS recorded, it seems like they could have given us a bit more.
The Survivor Season One DVD has won a permanent spot in my collection.  This critic has spoken.",978912000,18,849,4.677852348993288
1386419,5,B000050XQO,"ayone who loved the show has to buy this DVD.  The out takes were outrageous and very interesting.  The extras that were featured on the DVD were excellent and gives a lot of information that is hard to find.  Even if you didn't like the show I think you should own this DVD just for the fun and excitement.  The only flaw was the uncensored Nudity of Rich and only Rich,  but only the back.",978912000,2,391,4.16
1386433,4,B000050XQO,"Having taped every episode of every season of Survivor, I was looking forward to getting the behind the scenes and never before seen footage that this had to offer. I was a little disappointed with the way it was put together, simply because it didn't really focus a lot on the contestants or show any good never before seen footage (maybe that's why it was never shown.)  If your a Survivor addict like myself you'll probably enjoy reliving the greatest moments of the show, but if you've never seen it and want to get the real deal I'd wait and see if they ever release the actual episodes.",1040601600,5,592,4.481481481481482
1386434,3,B000050XQO,"Being a survivor junkie I was hoping to enjoy this one.  I didn't.  This seems to be a few highlights from the first season, yes, all of Susan's dialogue is in there, and so is Rudy's not liking Richard in a homosexual way, but it doesn't have a lot of substance.  It is highlights from each episode, but there isn't a whole lot that you haven't seen before.  Some is uncensored dialogue, but you don't see much of many of the cast members.  You do see a lot of the final four, others are in there as well, but they don't get the features that those four do.  Personally I'd rent this one but I wouldn't purchase it.",1038528000,6,616,4.177966101694915
1386435,3,B000050XQO,"Talk about summing up a series.  This dvd was way too condensed.  They summed up each show in a short period of time and didn't get into specifics.  Sometimes they touched on why a person was booted but when it came down to the Tribal council it was quite vague.  I saw the show when it came out but watching this didn't help my memory any.  You didn't see the Alliances which is what I remember from the show and what Survivor is about.  The challenges were a collage of about a one and 1/2 minute highlights... come on.  Pro's - it did have all the audition tapes and bios with deleted scenes but overall it didn't do justice to the original show and it's Gameplay - Outwit, Outplay, Outlast.

But as a Survivor junkie, that's what I wanted, and I couldn't help but be a little dissapointed. This was it though, as the rest of the DVD was a good synopsis of the time out on the island. What it did not do, though, was bring back much of the excitement that watching the show brings, which was the major dislike of the DVD. Overall, It's a good buy for diehard fans, and a good fix for those who miss the thrill of the first season.",1028419200,,587,4.0256410256410255
1386437,4,B000050XQO,"I'm a huge Survivor fan, and I really enjoyed this DVD.  It takes you through all the players and some of the things that they had to do, in the order that they were voted off.  It's a highlights disk instead of a replay of the shows.  My sister missed the first and second seasons, so this was a great for her to catch up.  The best thing about watching Survivor, is that you get to see people stabbing each other in the back to win some silly money.  You see, that happens everyday at work, it's just hidden.  You don't even know when your being stabbed in the back.  The show helps me look for it at work.  Thanks Survivor.",1022198400,,626,4.115702479338843
1386438,4,B000050XQO,"Now that we are up to the fourth round of ""Survivor"" it is rather interesting to go back and watch the original contest once again for several reasons.  First, just as it was always interesting to watch an episode a second time to see how Mark Burnett tried to simultaneously set up and disguise the ending in terms of who got voted off the island that week, it is interesting to see how the gang of four are set up.  I thought the greatest success of the show was that even when we reached the point that it was clear who the final four were going to be that it managed to create doubt each and every week as we talked things over at the office and kept thinking that sooner or later the rest of the survivors would catch on and do something about it.  I am always interested in the show about the show; in one regard I liked the 24/7 coverage of ""Big Brother"" that was available on line (for free) the first time because you could compare what ""really happened"" in the house with what they actually aired.  The ""new"" clips provided on this tape give you a little more information in this regard, but you can pick up more from the various books about the show.
Second, watching the original ""Survivor"" again also reaffirms the closeness of the competition.  By the time they got to the endgame I was voting for Rich, but when Kelly won all those immunity competitions in a row I was thinking that maybe this was a sign from the gods or something.  However, I was too busy trying to figure out how the others were going to vote to ever really decide who I would have actually voted for if I had been at the final tribal council.  But when you can argue that it came down to Greg's ""pick a number"" nonsense, I think our society really needs to reconsider the cultural lesson of Rich's final victory.  Even if you go back to the first tribal council of the merger, where the gang of four took our Gretchen and everybody else voted for a different person, you can see how easily things could have gone the other way.  Unfortunately, Gretchen's tribe was the first and only one in ""Survivor"" history NOT to go after someone from the ""other"" tribe immediately after the merger (although, yes, the current group of clowns ate one of their own instead of voting off one of the lazy jerks from the other tribe that joined when the tribes were all shook up).  If Gretchen's tribe has immediately gone after the weakest member of the ""other"" tribe (Kelly?), then they would have won on a 5-4 vote, and odds are Gretchen would have ended up winning.
Now think about how much that would impact our culture if the person who was best at ""surviving"" won instead of the person who played ""Survivor"" the best.  A key distinction, especially since the vast majority of survivors since then have taken Rich's victory as a sacred blueprint, carved in tablets of gold or something, instead of a series of situations breaking just the right way.  In his post-game interviews Rich has kept alive the myth that his victory was inevitable, that he was in control every step of the way.  There is some validity to this claim in terms of voting, but there is also some revisionist history involved here.  In a sense Rich wins by default because no matter how many times it was painfully obvious what was happening with regards to the voting, the other survivors refused to wake up, smell the coffee and write ""RICH"" at tribal council.
Besides: Rich's big contribution was his ability to catch fish and feed the others.  If the original ""Survivor"" had taken place in Australia or Africa, what would he have done to offset his personality?
Judging by those who have followed, the lesson of Rich's victory is be, in the immortal words of Sue, a ""snake.""  However, ironically enough, those who have followed the gospel according to Rich have not been the ones who win or even finish second.  Yet many of the other survivors in Australia insisted on characterizing their winner as being evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty because she ""played the game"" well.  Maybe it all comes down to the fact that I would have liked to have lived in a world where Gretchen was the winner rather than Rich, especially given the social importance that has been placed on what happened.  But, it was so CLOSE!",1020124800,,4260,4.494818652849741
1386439,3,B000050XQO,"Being a Survivor Junkie myself, I loved it!
However, if you're looking for an in-depth look at the first season, you might find yourself disappointed. This is not a full showing of each episode--you can't find that anywhere.  Rather, it's a pasted together collage of bits and pieces from each episode, so you can get the feel of how it went (even if sometimes the story is a bit hard to discern).  I liked the added features alot, and seeing the auditions was great -- but the way the actual 'movie' part of the DVD was a bit long, and I found certain parts should have been clipped or cut shorter for the more interesting ones. While I am only nitpicking on the editing, it's still a great flashback to that first season, and if you love Survivor, you have to get this.
I found the 2nd season DVD to be much better edited than this one, though I liked the added features better in this one than in the second one. I'd recommend to anyone that is a true survivor junkie to pick it up.",1018742400,,985,4.290322580645161

However, there are audition tapes for each of the contestants as well as more lengthy parting words by each Survivor after they recieved the boot. There is a little profanity heard from B.B. and Sue that was edited out of the televised episodes and you do get a few clear pictures of Richard Hatch's .....butt. That's about it.

Granted, with some more footage of challenges and the rewards that were won it could have been better, but the interview with Mark Burnett and Jeff Probst (the highlight of the DVD for me) more than make up for the shortcomings in that area. So, for anyone who claims to be a true fan of Survivor (as some previous reviews have stated, it's not really for first time viewers of the show) it is a must have.",998179200,,545,4.300970873786408

If you haven't seen the full CBS series, you'll probably wonder why America is bonkers over ""Survivor."" Or how Kelli, Sue, Rudy, Jenna, Sean and Hatch became household names. Probst is not a stupid man. He's in this strictly for the buck. That said, he should have released a box-set of the complete series with about 2 hours of deleted footage. But no, this quickie DVD (also available on VHS) contains pretty packaging and little else. Much is made about the audition tapes, the fighting, the immunity challenges, the bad weather, the lack of food and the voting procedures. Probst's Cheshire cast smile is grating. He professes to know all the answers, but I'd be willing to pay big bucks to see how well he would do during the immunity challenges. Yes, he's a smooth talker. Yes, he knows how to market himself and the show. But this isn't the DVD everyone's been waiting for. Sorry, Jeff. You lose. ""The Tribe has spoken.""",989193600,3,1272,4.786363636363636

Since I didn't watch most of the series on TV, I really cannot tell what were the new scenes and what was not. However, I can say that if you watched the series and you want a recap then buy it!

1386459,4,B000050XQO,"I've just watched this DVD and I really had a great time. ""Survivor"" is one of the most creative shows of all times and it is really amazing if you think 16 different people will have to stay 39 days together isolated in a faraway island to win 1 million dollars . The diversity between people is what makes this show so unique and so exciting.
The DVD is good, showing the best moments of the TV program, also containing a cool documentary on pre-production, with the show creator and its host. The only thing I thought annoying in this DVD was the edition. The DVD shows all the tribal council but does not show the show challenges, which happen to be the most interesting thing on the program.
The cast was really weird: a 39 year old and gay man, an old marine guy, a black woman who did not have white friends, an elderly lady who had cancer, a crazy and hippie guy called greg, a tough woman called sue, among others.
One of the craziest moments was the final tribal thing, where the last two participants had to be voted by a jury composed by the rest of the cast previously eliminated. WOW! Kelly, one of the finalists, was deeply offended by Sue, and I think it was really hard for kelly to hear her speech without attacking her back.
Anyway, here in Brazil we are watching the second season of a show based on ""survivors"" and it was really cool for me to watch the original version of the show, which started this whole competition.

1386460,2,B000050XQO,"One thing that really kind of ticked me off is that in all the television promos for the video/DVD, they don't ever tell you that it's just highlights of the show and they really play up the never-before-seen footage. I was sooooo excited about getting to see the couple of episodes that I missed. (I studied psychology, and from a group dynamic aspect, this show was fascinating!) So I was really disappointed to find out that it was just highlights. The never-before-seen footage? From what I could tell, it included a few 30-second speeches (maybe), and the language and nudity weren't edited. The nudity wasn't anything I haven't seen on NYPD Blue (not that I WANTED to see more of Richard's bare behind or anything else, for that matter, but they really played this up in the packaging), and the language was stuff you could guess despite the bleeps they introduced on television. The one thing that I REALLY enjoyed was the 20-minute ""featurette"" with the creator and the host. It was really interesting to hear the things they had to say.",980121600,3,1045,4.747252747252747

When I seen this dvd advertised I was very excited. I bought it thinking that it would have the 13 episodes that were shown on tv, plus extra never before seen footage. I was a little disappointed to find it was only hightlights from the episodes. There was a lot that they left out, like the challenges which I truly loved. So you don't get the exact feel of it all.
I still enjoyed the dvd, and I enjoyed the extras, (well, most of them, excluding naked Rich). It brought back some good memories of watching it for the very first time.
So if you watched it before, and are a fan, I recommend picking this dvd up, but if you didn't watch it and were planning on getting this dvd to see what the fuss was all about, I recommend holding off.

1386472,1,B000050XQO,"Survivor is without a doubt one of the least best shows of the milleninum. The action adventure soap proves that American culture and society has reached never precedented levels of voyerism and curriousity.
Basically, it is just Gilligan's Island with a bigger budget and the explicitly stated promise that they will eventually get off the island (and we all know how lowly that show stands today!)It is amazing how easily some viewers forget this is a fictional television show and therefore the characters are not actually real.
Although it would have been remotely interesting if they had to actually scavenge for food, and fight off a tiger or some other wild animal, ABC in reality kept them nice safe and secure. I do not care what obsessed fanatics think, there is no way they actually survived that much without the comforts of modern society.

1386473,4,B000050XQO,"I'll be the first to admit that I loathed the premise behind Survivor.  For all it's ""real life, uncensored drama,"" it was still an incredibly manipulative, voyeuristic program.  I got hooked on the show by the third week, when the various survivor names started sticking in my mind with the various survivor faces and personalities.  If anyone made it far enough in this series to have favorites, they were fans, whether they admit it or not.  Now that the show is revered as ""the"" reality TV event of 2000 (and not reviled, like Big Brother or the wretched Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire), viewers who were too 'principled' to watch the show faithfully can turn to this DVD for the rest of the story.  Those of us who became ravenous fans may find ourselves slightly disappointed with this compilation of ""greatest"" and ""most outrageous"" moments.
The structure of this compilation is fairly straightforward: viewers are given a slightly expanded view of the pre-island days, and after establishing the basic premise of the two teams (and setup of the two camps), we go straight into the eliminations.  Each survivor gets their own ""chapter"" on DVD, in the order of their departures from competition.  These chapters highlight the social standing of each contestant, just prior to losing at tribal council.  The soon to be banished survivor's pre-selection interview and ""demo tape"" is spliced in with footage of them in various ""notable"" social interactions.  These are also the chapters in which continuity is ignored, and occasionally an already banished survivor appears, in interaction with the victim-to-be.
Some of the ""heavier"" moments are highlighted, though virtually every minor alliance and casual friendship wound up on the cutting room floor.  That's the problem with taking 14+ hours of televised footage and straining it down to manageable 2 hour feature.  But don't worry that your favorite survivor's personality has been whitewashed: Stacy still comes off as snide, Gervase's lazy charm is in force, etc.  The survivors who lasted longest get the most exposure, of course.  Speaking of 'exposure,' parents can need not worry about the nudity warning that flashes onscreen before the program begins: there are half a dozen fanny shots (mostly Richard) that never made it to TV.  (Oh yeah...nice butt, Greg!)  Profanity is probably the only objectionable material here, since there are some four letter words that made the final cut.  For sheerly disgusting moments, nothing beats the fish-thing Richard catches, which starts to melt into slime the minute he cuts it open.  Yes, even worse than the larvae eating sequence.
Of the many Survivor-related conversations I've had at work, it seems like a lot of people questioned ""actual"" personalities versus ""televised"" personalities.  No one can say how each survivor adapted their ""normal"" speech and activities for the sake of TV (remember Greg & Colleen's fake fling?), but the way in which producers ""arranged"" and scored material to achieve a certain impact with TV audiences is reinforced here.  Again, some of the survivors (Sonja, BB, Ramona) register only nominal personalities, but many of the others were shown to audiences cast in the light of the producer's eyes.  So much of the ""total"" experience is edited that this DVD will reinforce the stereotypical character traits associated with each survivor...rather than show you a side of their personalities you didn't see when the show aired.
The bonuses on this disc are fairly interesting.  There's a section of survivor bios (still frame reading) and voting histories, a map of survivor island and it's environs, a bit about the climate, vegetation and wildlife on the island, and a few other goodies.  The 'documentary' piece is a worthwhile extra, featuring narratives from host Jeff Probst and series creator Mark Bennett.  No, neither of them tells us who their favorite survivors were, but Probst' enthusiasm for the show makes his hokey host routine easier to bear.
In spite of some over-familiarity and unavoidably massive editing, this Survivor compilation is probably a must-own for fans.  It's also a worthwhile 'document' in regard to television history, no less remarkable for it's manipulative premise.

1386475,5,B000050XQO,"ME: Hi. My name is Greg, and I'm a reality show addict.
THE GROUP, IN UNISON: Hi, Greg. Welcome.
Just the other day I reviewed ""The Real World You Never Saw,"" a DVD with new footage from the most recent season of MTV's ""Real World."" Although the new footage was good, I thought there wasn't nearly enough of it, and the DVD was not worth its cost.
Fortunately, that wasn't the case with the Survivor DVD. I thought it really delivered and that I got a lot for what I paid. The bulk of the DVD summarizes everything that happened throughout the season. It does so by putting the spotlight on each successive castaway in the order in which they were voted off.
The DVD blended new and previously aired footage. I thought the mix was very good. The previously seen material was stuff I definitely wanted to see again anyway. The new footage was stuff that really helped flesh out who these people are and how they interacted with each other on the island. (If only some of the weaker reality shows had such good editors.) I really felt as if this DVD helped me to get to know the castaways better.
In addition, to simply summarizing the season, there were a few segments that weren't necessary for understanding what happened but were great to see. For example, there was a challenge toward the end (right before Colleen got kicked off) where the castaways got to look at themselves in a mirror and guess how much weight they had lost. The person who got the closest received a small food reward. I assume this was never aired because of time limitations, but I was very glad it was included on the DVD. This is exactly the kind of stuff I wanted to see.
From reading the Survivor book, I know there was another unaired reward challenge that took place on the first or second day on the island. If I remember correctly, Joel was the winner. I was surprised that this challenge wasn't also on the DVD, but perhaps the producers felt that it wasn't interesting enough.
Anyway, I enjoyed the DVD very much, and I definitely felt that it was worth the money. If you've never seen SURVIVOR, you might have a bit of difficulty following what's going on on the DVD. (Wouldn't it be cool if the whole series were eventuially released on DVD? I'd love that.) However, if you watched and enjoyed the show, I can't imagine you not enjoying the DVD.

Next, you're treated to the footage of that week's Tribal Council vote, with each contestant explaining the rationale behind his/her vote.  Finally, the ejected member addresses the camera for a fairly lengthy farewell speech.  An additional feature of my DVD version was a trivia background segment on each contestant listing such earth-shaking information as their favorite hobbies, candy bars, etc.  (I chuckled when I read that Rudy's favorite smell was ""Food"").  Much of the video was a rebroadcast of what was seen on television, although there is a new challenge segment where each contestant guesses how much weight he's lost.  Admittedly, some of the original thrill of ""Survivor"" is lost since you already know who's getting the boot, but this video does provide a very pleasant fix for those ""Survivor"" junkies who can't wait until the next series.",979084800,20,1683,5.0215827338129495

The show had everything a viewer could want--adventure, ruthless human interaction, comedy, some cute people to look at, and a shocking conclusion.  Anyone who liked the show is certain to love this uncensored video.  It finally allows us to see some of the things that were only hinted at on the CBS show.  A+",979084800,5,399,4.739130434782608

This disc isn't as bad as most people say, but the season set will definitely be the better buy.",1080345600,12,329,4.076923076923077
7929160,5,B000050XQO,"This video is an overview of the original season of Survivor with some extras as noted above.  It's a good review of the two tribes that started all the hub bub, but it may not be for everybody.  I encourage you to watch this Survivor video if one or more of the following applies to you:
1.  You missed some of Survivor 1 but greatly enjoyed the episodes you saw.
2.  You are in some type of Fantasy Bowl Survivor, either at work, with friends, or on the CBS website.
3.  You're on the CBS Survivor's mailing list and get excited to see the previews for the next Survivor episode in your inbox.
4.  You have ever purchased an official Survivor buff or any other type of memorabilia.
5.  You want to catch the attention of someone you know to be a Survivor fanatic.
6.  You have applied, or would like to apply, to be a contestant.
7.  You want to re-live the Greg-talking-to-a-coconut moments.
8.  You own the Survivor board game.
9.  You were on the first season of Survivor.
10.  You need detailed instructions on how to build a Superpole.
11.  Each of the items on this list is completely comprehendable to you.
If you're only feeling lukewarm about the series, this video isn't going to turn you into a fan.  I would recommend Survivor:  Pearl Islands for that.  :)

7929161,1,B000050XQO,"What a waste of time.  As an avid fan of Survivor I felt that the money spent was not worth it.
This was boring, boring, boring and there was no excitement whats so ever and good have gone to a fine resturant for the money spent on this garbage. :(",1073865600,3,248,3.96
7929162,3,B000050XQO,"I bought this for my parents since they didn't get to watch the first season.  I would have rather watched the full season again than what they considered to be the ""highlights"".
The DVD starts out showing the castaways upon the boat and traveling to the island.  Then you get to see them arriving on the island and setting up camp.  From here, the DVD starts introducing the castaways by showing their audition tapes, their audition interview and then a few highlights of their stay on the island.  Then they proceed to show you each person getting voted off and what they said after they were eliminated.  They follow the order of who was voted off first, second, etc.  The DVD also shows a few challenges and more emotional moments of the series, but they didn't show the best parts of the season.
I watched the whole first season and was really surprised of the things they left out during the editting of this DVD.  I was very dissappointed and thought that this would be something that my parents would love since they had started watching the shows in the last few seasons.  But my dad was nodding off during the viewing and it looked like several (my whole family was watching) were getting bored and watching the clock.  It did cause a little discussion after we were finished, but we were mainly talking about what we missed.  I really wish they would have shown just the highlights of the season instead of all the interviews and auditions.  Watching the whole season in its entirity would have been nice too.",1072310400,11,1520,4.592592592592593
7929163,2,B000050XQO,"Bummer!  This is only a 2-hour-15 minutes DVD of highlights from the first Survivor.  The nudity is nothing really.  A rear-end shot of one survivor and Richard sitting down ""tucked under"" and walking naked.  But no private parts seen here.  Having not seen all of the episodes of Survivor. I was hoping for a complete, unedited, uncensored version, with all episodes Collector's DVD set.  I guess it is not possible.  One special feature is the ""Survivor: Inside the Phenomenon"", a 20-minute documentary, which I found to be quite interesting, especially how fair the game is, the exhausting hard work Producer, Mark Burnett and the Art Department can do, and how they managed to surprise the Challenge Survivor Winner, Sean, with a surprise visit from his father on the yacht at such short notice.  How they got his father there at such short notice is remarkable.",1050019200,11,866,4.924137931034482
