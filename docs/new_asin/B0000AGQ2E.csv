1905631,4,B0000AGQ2E,"The first thing you will notice when this movie starts is it's independent, low budget feel. The second thing you notice is Ed Burns voice is not suited for voice over narration. It quickly makes you wonder why you came to see this movie and if you just wasted your money.
Confidence can easily be summed up as a cross between Oceans Eleven and The Usual Suspects. Sounds great you say? Well, as good as the movie is, it doesn't quite do what the afore mentioned movies do so well. It's sort of gets caught in the middle. This isn't really a complaint as coming close to either of those two films is an acheivement on it's own.
The film stars Ed Burns as Jake, the leader of a crew of con men (sound familiar?). At some point in the story, he and his fellows con a victim from a sizable amount of money. As it turns out, that money wasn't his. He was transporting it for organized crime racketeer Mr. King (Dustin Hoffman) who has a reputation of doing not-to-nice things to people who upset him. King wants his money back, and instead of running and hiding (like he should have) Jake confronts him and tells him he'll square the deal by doing a con job for him; letting King take a cut equal to what Jake took from him. King insists that the the mark (victim) of the con be a rival of his (a much bigger rival) and that they take on one of King's men to their crew. Along their way, they pick up Rachel Weis and plan the biggest con of their career. Unfortunately, a long time nemesis Treasury Department agent (played by Andy Garcia) wants Jake in a bad way and has just picked up his trail.
What follows is the plot of the film that, like the two films I mentioned earlier, should not be given away. In this post-Usual Suspects/Memento world, the edge of the twists in this film seem a bit dulled. However, the way the film opens up at the end showing you how everything went wrong (reminding your of American Beauty), Confidence grabs you and never lets go inching you closer, compelling you to wonder, ""what happened?"" ""Where did it all go wrong?""
You may not be caught totally off guard at the films end, but you will appreciate the way the film got there, and the intelligence of the script. The film has been called ""a poor man's Ocean's Eleven"", but that is a good thing in a sense, as this films plot and characters are a lot more grounded in reality making the plot much more believable.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film and plan to add it to my DVD collection when available (I don't buy many films). Lower production values and some directing inadequecies prevented this film from being better, but in all I still easily give this a four-star rating. If you enjoy smart con/heist/caper movies, I highly recommend you check Confidence out.",1051833600,4,2749,4.413385826771654
1905632,3,B0000AGQ2E,"Any con-artist will tell you that in order for any con to work no matter how big or small you have to gain the victim or the mark's confidence. Otherwise your target will see right through you and know he's being lead on. James Foley's ""Confidence"" knows this key ingredient and the movie gets our confidence and manipulates us.
 I love, absolutely love con movies. I think most people find it fascinating to see how these people work. To see the cons unfold right before our eyes. Con movies often possess the same qualities a con-artist should. They are sleek and sneaky. Some con movies rank among my favorites. Take ""The Grifters"", or the works of David Mamet and films like ""House of Games"", ""The Spanish Prisoner"", and ""Heist"". And speaking of Mamet, ""Confidence"" remind us of his work. Foley directed ""Glengarry Glenn Ross"". But, ""Confidence"" doesn't seem to come off as polished. I don't care what anyone tells me I think Mamet's dialogue is dead on. But, Doug Jung, the writter of this movie, doesn't seem to have the sparkle Mamet does.
 ""Confidence"" had me going along with it the first 2\3 of the movie. The final acts ""seems"" to fall apart. We start to question the actions the characters make. And yet again this leads us back to Mamet again and a theme and in fact a line that always shows up in his work, ""Can you ever really trust anyone""?
 ""Confidence"" starts off nicely, it's told in flashback form. We see a con in progress. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) and his team, including Gordo (Paul Giamatti) and Miles (Brian Van Holt) are conning a guy out of a large amount of money. The con seems to go well, until, someone dies. That my friends, is never a good sign. It seems the guy they conned was carring money that didn't belong to him, but instead belonged to ""King"" (Dustin Hoffman, who is truly one of the highpoints of the movie). King, naturally wants his money back. And soon Jake makes a deal with King to get back his share. The plan is to con Morgan Price (Robert Forster from ""Jackie Brown""). Price is a ... bussiness man who King has something against. Only problem is, it's just about impossible to con him. So Jake gets together a new team including Lily (Rachel Weisz) and Lupus (Franky G.) who works for King.
 ""Confidence"" is one of those movies where you should walk into it knowing nothing. Not to worry, I didn't give away any vital information. I've only told you what you've probably seen in the trailers.
 Now, is this movie worth seeing? I don't think a large part of the audience will enjoy it. As I said the first 2\3 of the movie is entertaining and the third act has problems. But, everything is resolved, only, I wish the conclusion would of come about differently. I also didn't like the fact that the story was told in flashback. When the movie is just telling it's story that's when it's at it's best. When it's dealing with the flashback set-up, it doesn't seem ""correct"". Something about it seems phoney to me. I just felt it wouldn't really be handle that way. But, a big surprise is going to happen. If ""Confidence"" would of kept going on the track it started for itself, it could of been one of the year's best movies. But, ""Confidence"" is conning itself. It's payoff just felt like it's cheating us. Some may be extremely disappointed, others, may love it. But, I didn't really buy it.
 So why does the movie work? Because it is directed with a lot of style. James Foley really tells the story in an interesting way. And the acting is quite good and at moments, great. Rachel Weisz and Burn may not have much chemistry onscreen together, but, they do have a lot of charm. They keep the movie going. And like I said Hoffman is a highlight. His role slows down as the movie goes along, but, when he is onscreen it's a pleasure. ""Confidence"" has good points to it which makes it hard for me to totally bash the movie. There is real craft here and it shows. I just wished they could of worked on that third act!
 Bottom-line: Entertaining con movie that may not hit the level of films by Mamet, but still brings somethng to the table. Fine acting and impressive directing is the film's saving grace.",1051574400,2,4147,4.49933598937583

Aside from that, it's still an altogether entertaining film with great acting and very few dull moments.

Edward Burns made for the perfect con man. He really made you question if any of his actions were genuine, because they all seemed equally genuine - a perfect con man.

At first I was skeptical of Dustin Hoffman being a mob boss with a sinister reputation, but he turned out to be an enormously entertaining eccentric that made for a refreshing change of pace. I must repent for ever doubting that Hoffman could pull off any roll.",1407456000,4,722,4.546153846153846

1905668,4,B0000AGQ2E,"`Confidence' is an `Oceans-11' type Heist movie with its own unique personality.  While he sticks to the genre formula, Director, James Foley, moves this film along at a steady, active pace and throws in enough twists and turns to keep us involved.

Ironically, the master mind is a guy named Jake Vig (Ed Burns).  Ironic because Mr. Vig (his last name meaning 'the take' or 'the amount charged by the bookie for services rendered') is a `charming, virile fellow' (slang definition for `jake`) who wishes to accomplish his 'gigs' with minimal actual violence.  Unfortunately, a heist goes sideways when he and his crew find they have jacked a morally bankrupt criminal called 'King' , who is not partial to letting things slide.  In fact, with an act of very harsh measure, King makes it acutely clear what he requires to resolve the matter. Of course Jake refuses and the negotiations begin.  This is where the twists and turns commence and the whole thing gets interesting.

The caliber of talent in `Confidence' is amazing. The crew, Brian Van Holt (Cougar Town), Paul Giamatti (Oscar nom.), Rachel Weisz (Oscar winner) and Ed Burns (a celebrated actor/director himself) come off as a tightly knit, intelligent bunch that are as close and trusting as family should be.  Two cops on the take (Donal Logue and Luis Guzman) are hilarious hired help who hope to come out ahead.  Of course, King (Dustin Hoffman, Oscar winner) has bodyguards galore.  Tiny Lister (as Harlan) intimidates politely, yet inimitably, as usual.  A young, handsome Latino, Frankie G, displays his chameleon-like acting chops as Lupus, Harlan's understudy.  There is a moderate amount of subtle symbolism, in my opinion.  Unfortunately, I've been told I have to be hit up long-side the head with it (symbolism) to see it.  For example, the name Lupus seems apropos for this particular bodyguard's character, in terms of the word's medical implications.  It would be a fun subject for discussion.

The movie, 'Confidence', ends up being a Heist/Revenge movie with some great twists and a surprise ending.  I'm not a great fan of Heist films, but I enjoyed my 97 minutes just fine.  It was well paced, well acted, and well ... I liked it.",1297296000,2,2210,4.927027027027027

Between the lackluster plotting, anemic acting (with the exception of Dustin Hoffman, who's a little annoying but certainly not boring) and the sad feeling of the film merely going through the motions, Confidence gives potential viewers almost no reason to watch the film when there are many far better movies about con men (e.g. The Sting, The Spanish Prisoner, House of Games, even Matchstick Men) out there.

The story follows the big con setup that Jake has to pull off for The King (to make up for ripping him off) on a crooked banker named ""Morgan Price.""

1905679,4,B0000AGQ2E,"Lousy con movies are some of the worst around. They can have a visible outcome from the get go, but it's the way they carry the story out that makes them bad. No class, no style, no sense of wonder at how the con will go down exactly.

A good con movie on the other hand is a thing to behold. HOUSE OF GAMES from David Mamet comes to mind, where the con that goes down come completely out of left field, even thought all of the clues were presented from the beginning. Or the greatest con movie of all time, THE STING. We saw or thought we saw what was going on. But by films end, we discovered that not only had Lonnegan been taken, but the entire viewing audience had been conned as well.

Now comes a con movie that uses the term in its title. CONFIDENCE tells the story of Jake Vig (Edward Burns) and his crew as they pull of a con right from the start, staging a fake murder, getting the mark to leave and then taking the money and running. It's not until later when one of the crew is murdered that they discover they conned the wrong man. The mark was an accountant for one of the deadliest independent crime bosses in LA, The King (Dustin Hoffman).

Rather than let themselves be taken out one by one, Jake sets up a meet with The King and makes a proposition. He won't pay back the money. But what he will do is run a tremendous con for The King, paying him back the original amount as well as interest.

Although wary, The King agrees and the game is on. Jake assembles his crew once more, replacing the newly deceased with a new shill (part performer, all con artist). He chooses a woman named Lily (Rachel Weisz) who picked his pocket earlier in the week. Along with his two partners and a pair of watchful eyes that The King insisted be a part of the crew, the fun begins.

The con involves a rival of The King, a mark named Morgan Price (Robert Forster). An upscale banker and shopping center investor (where he launders enough money to rival the mint), Jake and crew set out to con him out of $5 million. Finding the easiest target they can, they set the con in motion.

Into this mix are all sorts of surprises from crooked cops that aid Jake (Luis Guzman and Daniel Logue) to a federal agent (Andy Garcia) whose been trying to get the goods on Jake for some time. While watching, keep in mind that no one is who they seem. And yet others are.

The fun of this movie comes on various levels. It's first off fascinating to watch how the con goes along, each step of the way. It's fun then to sit and wonder just who is conning who and if this person or that is involved. And it's a treat to watch a group of actors blend so well into their characters that you don't even consider the fact that they're acting.

I figured out portions of the ending before they came along and you will too. But then there are those magnificent twists that come as a surprise at the films end. Surprises that make this movie one that is a pleasure to watch.",1205366400,,2953,4.204946996466431

We have a team of grifter buddies who get along well and like each other's company, willing to take a high stake scam against the ""King"" - local mafia boss.  It is helping that they have one foxy girl (beautiful Rachel Weisz) to help out the boys with the scam as only the girl can pull.  But this film drags and drags with not enough humour to keep the atention span going.  There are too many parallel stories going on at once so warning - do not watch this movie while tired - you just will not get it what just happened.  I liked Giamatti's performance, but so disappointed that any time Ed Burns is in the film, it is always the same thick NY accent, his dandy looks and some mischief we know he is up to that makes any of his films so darn predictable.

1905681,3,B0000AGQ2E,"For a while, most the 90's and early 2000's, twist ending movies lead the way at the local megaplex.  While it seems that Bryan Singers' outstanding The Usual Suspects lead this charge, this new ""genre"" had its own roller coaster ride.  The highs ranking up there with movies like The Sixth Sense to the lows with anything else done by M. Night Shyamalan.  While Sense was a jaw dropper the first time around, the movie looses its appeal after repeat viewings and falls into a category of a good ghost movie.  Today's film, Confidence is a film that follows the same story structure as Suspects, but falters in its story telling and ability to be original.

Confidence opens with the soon to be dead Jake Vig (Edward Burns) having to explain to his executioner why he got himself into this predicament.  Jake is a grifter, a good one that has unknowingly stolen thousands from Winston King (Dustin Hoffman) in a grift and, in the aftermath, lost a partner to King's enforcers.  Jake sets up a meeting with King in order to set the air clear and promise to pay back the money stolen from the King by doing a grift for him against a person of Kings choosing.  King, of course, picks the one person you wouldn't want to grift, an international banker with mob ties.  Jake and his crew go about setting up an elaborate scheme to steal millions from the banker, pay off King, and get away with a profit.  Of course things go south, people turn on each other and we end up back at the beginning of the film watching the last seconds of Jake Vig's life tick away before our eyes.

One of the biggest weaknesses of the film is Edward Burns voice over work.  He states the obvious to many times and really reveals too much and ruins certain scenes.  His work on camera is good, ala a blue collar George Clooney in the Ocean's Trilogy.  Dustin Hoffman, having joined Jack Nicholson in the ""over-the-top villain"" club, is a blast to watch.  His character oozes a strange evil/kookie vibe that is one of the few original things in the film.  Paul Giamatti steals his scenes by out-acting everyone in the scene and Rachel Wiesz does what she does best: being easy on the eyes.

While the movie does not break new ground, it provides an entertaining premise that never really slows down.  It keeps up a steady pace with many cut away shots and up tempo music.  The scripting is really what bogs down the movie in the end with choosing to show certain parts of the con while leaving others to be played out.  It would have been a lot better of the film if they could of worked out some of Jake's voice over into actual scenes in the film, but instead we are subjected to being told what's happening instead of figuring it out for ourselves.

Confidence is a good film for a one or two time showing, after that, the twist become dull and the action very flat.  Unlike Suspects, which keeps bringing you coming back with Kevin Spacey's role and the strong musical score, Confidence has a hard time trying to stay original.  Think of it as a greatest hits album of con films with too many ""B side"" tracks worked into the album that make you skip around without going straight through; you have fun, but you won't be satisfied.",1196121600,4,3208,4.474226804123711

1905685,3,B0000AGQ2E,"CONFIDENCE (2003) is a hit for audiences who can find a way in

themselves to laugh at the misfortune of those who make wrong

decisions, costing them thousands, purely from the blindness of their

greed, and engage in unusual business deals.

Although Edwards Burns is reminiscent of Ben Affleck, and Rachel

Weisz of Melanie Griffith, the charm they project to the cameras, is

natural, and convincing.

The editing is a strong point in this movie, because it keeps the

audience on its toes, the action  upbeat, the attention spans wide

open as the story unfolds in a clear, understandable manner.

A lot of effort was put in the script, clearly, in terms of the

number of short funny phrases, and in the semi-serious narrative. As

said, there's a pleasure, excitement and personal presence projected

by every single one of the actors that raises the picture a notch or

two.

The soundtrack is upbeat, cool and brings  a relaxation ambience to

the underlying action, very well done.

The filming is excellent, showing a wide spectrum of sharp  sequences

indoors and outdoors, variety of pastel colors in a number of scenes,

contrasted with black and while in other moments, to change the mood

of viewers. The  wide-screen brings a theatrical feeling to the home

viewer.

There's perhaps an excessive effort in educating viewers in

terminology , touching upon a mark, shill, roper, insider, score,

fix, Belize offshore, money laundering, setting up a shell

corporation, arranging for a loan, but this is not surprising

considering the need for a all viewers to accompany the action. The

subtitles may also help, for those not familiar with some jargon.

An unfortunate aspect, is the excessive comfort of the story teller

with the actual behavior being done, such that some might see it

condoned, from the lack of addressing the moral implications

involved.

Also, every single person in the movie seems to be on the take, which

seems unnecessarily unrealistic or simplistic.

Andy Garcia brings in a semi-comical, very professional, low-key

performance in playing the role, as someone whose intentions are

hard to perceive.

Overall, from every standpoint, most audiences will find this DVD

entertaining. ""As in chess, you needs to see 20 moves ahead in the

game.""",1181433600,2,2290,5.043010752688172

1905690,4,B0000AGQ2E,"If you enjoyed the 2001 version of OCEAN'S ELEVEN with its great ensemble cast and witty dialogue with a great twist at the end then the movie ""Confidence"" should definitely appeal to you. In fact I would go as far as to say that this movie is the true sequel to the Clooney vehicle and not the OCEANS TWELVE that appeared in the same year.

And hey, Andy Garcia even shows up in this movie also, this time as a federal agent hunting down the hero of the movie (played by Edward Burns).

The movie opens with a familat movie trick. Held at gunpoint with his life on the line the hero recounts in flashbacks how he found himself in his present predicament. We learn that his crew pulled of a con on an accountant, taking the man for over $100,000.

The only problem is that said accountant was playing with the money of big-time mobster ""The King"" (played with zany relish by Dustin Hoffman), and he's none to happy with their antics.

So, the team strike a deal with King to pull off another sting this time against King's sworn enemy, a crooked banker, for a cool $5 million.

What follows is fairly familiar territory (at least for those who saw OCEAN'S ELEVEN). The additional members of the team are assembled and the job is pulled through a series of machinations. Then at the end there is a major twist that turns everything on its head, but still fits in well with the overall structure of the story.

The performances are also very good in this movie with top marks doing to Hoffman as an ADHD mobster and Rachel Weisz as a pickpocket who is recruited onto the team to help snare one of the vice presidents at the targeted bank.",1122422400,5,1636,4.400662251655629

It wants to be smart, but doesn gets there. The writing is poor, and motivations of the main characters are weak. Would you run a scam operation from your own home? They use their place to do cons, thinking  the guy will be too scared to come back!!!

dusting Hoffman doesn't sell it as a mafioso, but with such bad writing, he did what he could. This one movie that should have never been done. With so many better con movies out there like Matchstickmen, Ocean's Eleven and the like, we didn't need Confidence.  Christopher Walken's ""Scam"" with Lorraine Bracco (from the Sopranos) is a much enjoyable and better movie than this one.

That has become almost a clich for this genre.  The smooth talking leader, the nerdy number two man, the seemingly dumb operative and, of course, the lovely young woman.

A crass version of an updated cross between Mission Impossible and The Sting without the sophistication.  The Dustin Hoffman character was also a clich, a disgusting inhuman type.  It was impossible to feel anything for any of these people, and the story and progress of the movie left me cold.  A mindless attempt at entertainment at best.",1116288000,,653,4.586206896551724

But the film opens with Burns on his knees, as an angry black man holds a pistol to his head and encourages him to tell his story--how weak a conceit is this?  And Burns procedes to do so in such a cool--one might even say disinterested--way that we can't ever believe his life is really in danger.  The whole business is revealed immediately by Burns' lack of emotion as a con, and all that remains to be hashed out are the details.  Admittedly, there is some fun in those very details--in particular Dustin Hoffman is absolutely terrific in his role, and he's got one of the funniest lines ever  about the performance of two sisters in his nightclub--I won't give it away.  The movie is worth seeing for his part alone, and it's more than the cameo other reviewers claim.  But it seems to me that the director expected to keep our interest through the twists of the plot; but anyone who's seen The Sting, Paper Moon, The Confidence Man, or Matchstick Men isn't going to be much surprised.  Furthermore, I don't buy the con working the way it was portrayed; walking into a bank and trying to cash a check for five million dollars on the spot would pretty much blow a hole in the entire thing.  Either less emphasis on the plot or more--which might end up losing most of the audience--would make a better movie; and more of Dustin Hoffman certainly would have improved it.

1905694,2,B0000AGQ2E,"Confidence is a fine example of the relative abundance of acting talent in movies today, compared with the relative dearth of really good writing.  Here we find Dustin Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Andy Garcia, Luis Guzman, and others gamely carrying a decent, but flawed script. The overall feel is somewhere between Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead, and an American version of Snatch, with aspects of House of Games, and a character-type borrowed from Bullets Over Broadway.

Edward Burns plays Jake Vig, the leader of a small crew of con men. The have just discovered that their latest victim was, unknown to them, the cheating accountant for a feared local gangster known as The King (Dustin Hoffman). To make restitution, Jake agrees to swindle one of The King's rivals. The bulk of the film details the planning, preparation and execution of the sting, along with the usual and appropriate questions about whom, if anyone, Jake can trust.

There are some very entertaining moments in Confidence. Among these are a great bit by Hoffman about his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a terrific short con in a jewelry store. And, unlike so many films, this one improves considerably toward the end. Its third act is far stronger than what comes before, which is refreshing.

Nevertheless, Confidence is weighed down by too many problems to be really enjoyable, among them: a clumsy and tired everything-in-flashback structure; a complete lack of chemistry between Burns and Rachel Weisz; a cartoonish Andy Garcia character, and an amazingly lame lunch meeting to pitch a business proposal.

Edward Burns really lost it in this movie. I lost the whole jist of the con as the movie progressed and in return recieved the feeling that not even Burns knew what he was shooting for.

Admittedly there was a few good scenes, and the plot wasn't bad, it just wasn't portrayed well at all. Andy Garcia's role the worst of all. Why was he even there at all. Who or what was he trying to fool? Besides, his role was too second rate and he deserves better.

Dustin Hoffman was also a disappointment, as a sex-crazed addict who thought of absolutely nothing but his dancers. He's much better than that, just watch Finding Neverland or Hook.

No, this movie was completely a waste of my time and braincells.

Running Time:  97 minutes

Rated R for language, violence and sexuality/nudity.

On the rare occasions when some movie comes along that breaks the rules of the Hollywood caper film (such as ""Memento""), we usually get cinematic excellence. But with ""Confidence"", don't be expecting any deviation from the format. ""Confidence"" is a fun, enjoyable, light caper movie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else and for what it is, it's not half bad.  Jake Vig (Edward Burns, in a rare short haired appearance) is a deeply skilled grifter who has just pulled off a major score with his crew (including Paul Giamatti and Brian Van Holt). Trouble is, the loot belonged to a major criminal kingpin (Dustin Hoffman), who wants Jake to pull a job for him to make up the difference. Looking at a potential con that will net all the participants over 5 million dollars, Jake recruits a shadowy woman (Rachel Weisz from ""The Mummy"") to the team, and they set off to make the score. On their tail is a federal agent (Andy Garcia), who has past ties to Jake, and who won't stop until he makes sure Jake is behind bars for good.

Written by Doug Jung, ""Confidence"" delivers everything you'd expect: the tough guys, the kooky criminal mastermind, the femme fatale, crooked cops, and a every line of dialog punctuated with the F-word. This is tired material, but director James Foley (""Glengarry Glen Ross"") gets the momentum moving early, and his storytelling is stylish and inoffensive. He pulls out every trick in the book to keep the barge afloat, and he's more successful than not. `Confidence' wouldn't turn too many heads in a crowded room, but as con films go, this is entertaining filmmaking and features a willing cast.  Dustin Hoffman easily notches his bedpost and steals the entire movie from the rest of the decent ensemble cast and leaves them spinning wheels in a predicable grift caper, while Burns and Weisz are adequate in the lead roles.

Even with all the smooth, hip con artist moves to watch, ""Confidence"" ultimately becomes so aware of audience participation, that it piles on the double-crosses, time switches, and multiple characters just to keep people guessing. Technically, it isn't terribly hard to figure out certain things that the film assumes to be fooling everyone, but in taking on such a twisty story, Foley loses the appeal that was there in the opening of the film, when things are a lot more streamlined. The overcompensation needed to keep the audience on their toes is too much, so when characters meet their ultimate fates, the expected reactions just aren't there. The audience is left behind, trying to keep it all together. For fans of stylish thieves and wacky criminals, this might be the umpteenth trip around the maypole with this plot, but it's a reasonable one worth a look.",1085702400,,2998,4.916831683168317

Its not Burns fault at all but he comes across more like a street kid who grew up than a man who has his finger on the pulse of the con that he is trying to pull. Paul Giamati is fine but does the same stick he always does, and Andy Garcia lacks the charisma to pull off his role well. The real acting of this movie comes from Rachel Weisz, who is better than the material that is giving to her, and she proves that in spades by the way she makes you watch her every move. She was much more believable con artist than the card board cut outs that Ed Burns and his men were, and she would have made a much better lead in this film as well if the director and the screenwriter wanted to make a better movie.

""Confidence"" by Lions Gate studio (king of indie films) has one great thing--the cast.  Edward Burns, Rachel Wiesz, Andy Garcia, Luis Guzman, Paul Giamatti, Brain Van Holt, Robert Forster, Morris Chestnut, and Dustin Hoffman.  Even the major studios in Hollywood can gather these names easily.
And the story?  Sorry, as it's about ""Con""fidence, so not much can be revealed, except that A) the con-men team (and one mysterious lady) led by Ed Burns have to do one last big heist while so many obstacles are in their way; B) and if you have seen old classic films of the sub-genre about grifters (yes, including ""The Grifters"" or ""Sting""), you have already seen the story itself in ""Confidence.""  Which means, you also have a chance to see two corrupt cops, and a strangely dressed FBI guy.
The story is not important, probably.  The characters are, it is certain, more interesting to see, and the standout is Dustin Hoffman's 'King' (or ""THE King""), a mobster who runs a lap-club.  And you should know the rule of the genre; he, being a mobster, has to have some quirky habits.  Hoffman playfully does it with cleverly hidden menace, which is certainly amusing to see.
There are some other well-acted characters, especially by Paul Giamatti (one of the most underrated talents), whose 'Gordo' is perfect example of small-time crook who speaks too much without thinking about what he is talking about.  And my favorite Rachel Weisz shows up as a pickpocket (with American accent), who gracefully changes her outer look with ease.
But not everything is perfect.  As I said, newcomer Doug Jung's script looks like a copied (but well-copied) one from the past classics, and director James Foley does his job decently, but not with great originality.  The plot unfolds smoothly and pleasantly, but nothing in it really surprises, or more to the point, makes you care the character(s).  Edward Burns speaks too much (with too many voiceovers), and if you use Robert Forster in this way, like three minutes with no substantial role, it means you are willingly inviting the fans' bitter criticism.
Not bad, not good (just like the same director's ""The Corruptor"") ""Confidence"" will entertain you for about 100 minutes.  And nothing more.  Actually, the best 'con' movie still remains ""Sting"" which you should have seen before this one.",1076198400,2,2361,4.946835443037974
1905707,4,B0000AGQ2E,"Confidence, is a nifty entry in the grifters/caper flick that should please the many fans of that genre (I'm one, and I enjoyed it).  Edward Burns has the lead in a terrific cast as Jake Vig, master Confidence man and the brains behind a veteran team of con-men who must pull off a difficult sting to extricate themselves from the wrath of a gangster played with sly nastiness by Dustin Hoffman, who has already had a member of Jake's team killed.
Jake recruits the gorgeous Rachel Weisz to replace the murdered member of the team, and we get the planning and execution of the caper with, of course, snags, hitches,double & triple crosses. This one has its fair share of twists and turns and, of course, that is the fun in these types of films.
Full of snappy, smart-ass dialogue and with superb actors, like Hoffman and Andy Garcia, doing a lot with what are actually  small supporting roles, director Foley keeps it tight and fast at 97 minutes.
In truth, my only complaint is that with such a great cast that includes: Paul Giamatti, Donal Logue, Luis Guzman, a completely wasted Robert Forster, plus, of course, Garcia, Weisz and Hoffman I only wished that the film was longer, had more plot and more for them all to do.

The actors are pretty good and the twist is finally well plaid. The plot is not very exciting and loses a bit of its importance. It's more as if you want to see what's next than what is all about. The story is quite flat and it could be really more exciting. Fact is I had the feeling the screenwriter was writing his script without knowing what he's writing about and improvising pages to pages.

1905709,5,B0000AGQ2E,"Simply stunning in presentation and story. Now granted this is not the first heist movie by far, but this is one of the greatest. Regardless of what others say this movie is beautiful, the acting is spot on and from beginning to end you are entranced in this heist that is going on in front of you. At some points you want to scream at the screen cursing certain characters or shouting warnings to others. With one of the greatest opening lines ever (so, I'm dead) you find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat from beginning until the end, which you will surely talk about to whoever is near you when the movie is over. It wraps up everything so nicely that you can't help but smile in a good mood as the story unfolds. Now without spoiling much or anything for that matter i hope you check this movie out. Whether you rent it or buy it, this movie needs to be seen to be believed. What are you waiting for?",1075420800,,913,4.252873563218391
1905710,3,B0000AGQ2E,"This watered-down ""thriller"" is the spawn of an unholy union: _Reservoir Dogs_ and _Usual Suspects_. Possessing neither the chilling terror of Dogs nor the mind-twisting plot of Suspects, _Confidence_ follows a formulaic approach in describing the aftermath of a grift gone bad.
Edward Burns is the leader of a motley group of con-men who have made their way to LA, having perfected a team approach to grifting. Their con takes place in a low-brow bar and when the ""mark"" witnesses a murder in the establishment - and the cops head in - the money is left behind in the confusion. Of course, the murder never really took place and the witnesses in the bar are in on the scam - as are the pair of crooked cops who show up. Problem is, this mark had money that belonged to the ""King"" - and when one of Burns' gang gets viciously slain, Burns is forced to have a sit-down with the King to try to make amends.
The King, head of a nonsensical, ""independent"" criminal enterprise, is played unconvincingly by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman - as a Dennis Hopper-type prone to violence - simply doesn't fit the bill, given that any 16-year-old high-school football player could wipe the floor with him.  Disappointingly, Burns never changes his persona during the entire movie - whether making time with a female pickpocket (Rachel Weisz) that conveniently shows up in his life - being threatened by a large firearm pointed at his nose - or in his day-to-day planning of the scam that will pay back the King and give the group their final, retirement score.
I could go on, but why bother? You can probably guess how it all turns out. The sad truth about this flick is that the talented actors are abused by a story that is simplistic, silly and completely unbelievable. If you've got nothing better to do on a rainy evening, certainly give it a watch. But expect to be underwhelmed, given the ability of a cast that has a lot more to offer than what you'll see here.",1074902400,,1949,4.600574712643678

Watching her seduce the VP of the Bank was a fun.
This movie is real predictable.  I watched it with a friend who never really into movies like I am, and she figured everything out from the first five minutes.  Now that is bad.

Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia have little more than extended cameos: Garcia never even changes clothes and Hoffman wears two shirts. A couple days' work, tops, for each, and it shows. A special mention for fine character actor Paul Giamatti (son of the late baseball commissioner) -- the best lines and best performance are his. Edward Burns looks more and more like Ben Affleck's twin brother every outing.
The standout of this ensemble cast though is Rachel Weisz who not only makes this film but gives it a touch of fun and class that it really does not deserve.
All the actors do their jobs but the predictability factor is stretch a little too far, and the con is really something we have all seen before.

1905717,2,B0000AGQ2E,"One of the special features included in this DVD is ""Anatomy of a Scene"" in which the director, writer, editor, production designer, actors, and cinematographer all talk about what was going on with one particular scene in the film.  In their sound bytes, they discuss the ""emotional subtext"" of the scene, how the editing emphasizes the main character's imagining how this heist will go down, et cetera, et cetera.
It's all so hip.  It's all so well thought out, so cool.  Yes, it is all that.  But somewhere in this mix, somebody forgot to give us characters we can identify with.  While it is true that plotting is the main force in a thriller/action movie, without characters that move the plot along, it's a soulless journey.  And even the plot here is a ""been there, done that"" kind of thing--a heist planned by a bunch of ultra-smart hipsters who know the con scene inside out, backwards and forwards and several of whom do not trust each other.
Nothing new, and that's too bad.  Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia play the most colorful characters here and if more had been made of them taking an ACTIVE role in the film, it might have been more interesting.  But they do their thing on the side while the lead guy, Jake Vig--played by trying-to-be-tough Edward Burns--puts the ""plan"" in motion.
So beneath all that ultra-hip jump cutting, slo-mo, gradual fades, zoom ins and outs, and overall ""watch me do this fancy camerawork"" stuff is a formulaic caper film that we fans of such things have seen before a million times.
Even Soderbergh's remake of Ocean's 11--with a totally miscast Julia Roberts--is better than this.  James Foley, the director, has done much better work.

Even a small role by Dustin Hoffman, cast as a bad guy, doesn't help.  The fact is that I just didn't care about the characters.  And, after a few minutes, I knew enough not to believe any of it.

1905720,5,B0000AGQ2E,"Confidence is a very underrated film, the type which passes in theatres unnoticed, to be rediscovered again by viewers in the video/DVD market.
The first impression I got from the film,(about a group of grifters,pulling off their biggest scam to repay the debt they owe to a crime lord they mistakenly swindled),is how well and slick James Foley's direction is. He has had so far a hit and miss career, with films alternating between the good 'noir' genre (Reckless, At Close Range) and the average drama (Two Bits, The Chamber), and doing a Madonna film in between, Who's That Girl..So certainly Confidence is his best film to date.
He successfully manages to keep the pace from the first scene till the very last, with a mix of clever editing, cool soundtrack, and engaging performances by all the cast.
Edward Burns refreshingly is acting in a movie that he did not write or direct, Rachel Weisz has not only a seductive presence on screen and is very beautiful to boost, but she can act too!
Andy Garcia,Luis Guzman,Paul Giamatti,are all wonderful, but of course the actor who steals the show is Dustin Hoffman. With his manic portrayal of the crime boss, he proves yet again that the label 'one of the best actors ever' is not accidental. In my opinion, it is one of his best roles in years.
I can describe Confidence as a faster sexier version of David Mamet's House of Games,with a touch of Ocean 11, a film that I am confident will surprise you, keep you watching till the end (with its nice twist), and will leave you with a satisfied feeling. It is probably not an all time classic, but with all  these factors present,I am not complaining.",1064966400,,1650,4.6506849315068495

And Rachel Weisz outdoes them both with a great performance that the screenplay does not even try to capitalize.  Doug Jung's script is really not a script at all but a series of blatantly rip off material from better con films, and a poorly done rip off at that. The DVD itself is better than the movie, and that's because you can see how bad the screenwriter had dropped the ball with this film.
See it for Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz and Ed Burns's performances, but don't expect a coherent plot.",1064880000,12,759,4.3076923076923075
1905722,2,B0000AGQ2E,"Maybe I've seen one too many contrived, confusing, gimmicky, stylish movies about crooks and conmen shooting it out with each other (more like fifty too many), but I found Confidence to be yet another entry in the postmodern film limbo that combine elements from earlier films like The Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction (or others by Tarantino) and House of Cards (or others by David Mamet). Confidence begins with a flurry of activity, made confusing by the overused flashback technique. Edward Burns plays Jake Vig, the leader of a gang of grifters whose modus operandi is to get marks to front them money and then scare them off with fake bloodshed. They run into trouble when they accidentally rip off someone who works for a feared gangster known as The King (Dustin Hoffman). The King is a modern movie cliche, the psychotic gangster with a unique idiosyncrasy (he has ADD), often played by Dennis Hopper or Christopher Walken. Hoffman is not the obvious choice for such a role, but he's enough of a pro that he brings the character to life and makes him amusing and even a little scary. Unfortunately, no one else in the movie is as interesting as Hoffman and the many twists and turns the script takes are rather mechanical and predictable. We know in a movie of this sort that nothing is what it appears and that the end will reveal some clever surprise that is not really a surprise at all. Edward Burns is too slick and nonchalant throughout the action, even when someone has a gun pointed at his head. Rachel Weisz is Jake's sultry love interest who may or may not be on his side. There are several other characters whose true identities and loyalties are not known until the end, including a pair of corrupt cops and a federal agent. The problem is, by the end, I didn't really care. I wish scriptwriters and directors would get back to basics, like character and story, and cut down on the flashbacks and excessive plot twists.",1064275200,2,1936,4.66374269005848

Comparison to David Mamet's superior `House of Games"" or to Stephen Frears' superb ""The Grifters"" is inevitable.
Edward Burns plays Jake Vig, leader of a small group of con men. Their game is to stage fake murders, the object of which is to scare away a `mark' who, in his haste, leaves behind a whole lot of cash. One afternoon, things go astray when the victim turns out to be the accountant for a notorious gangster called King [Dustin Hoffman]. King nabs the group and demands his money back. Jake makes a deal in which his guys will take one of King's rivals for five million dollars. King sends in one of his men to keep an eye on things, while Jake recruits a beautiful woman [Rachel Weisz] to help in the con. The question is whether or not the clever Jake can outwit the infamous King in a tense cat-and-mouse game.
All the actors try hard, but are limited by their roles. The best performance is Hoffman's, who plays a sleaze ball with great relish.
The cinematography is excellent and lends a colorful, moody feel to the movie. The editing is fast paced. If the script had been sharper, this would have been a classic film noir.",1064102400,,1416,4.600790513833992

Pulling off a con for these guys is a sinch or so it seems when Burn's men by accident steal money from the wrong guy, Winston King played by masterful Dustin Hoffman.  Vig has two options, die or pull off the slickest and biggest con of his career.  In the new pack he brings along a sexy con artist, Lily played by beautiful Rachel Weisz and his returning crew featuring Paul Giamatti, Brian Van Holt and Luis Guzman.  Though Burns is in on some trouble because a Special Agent is on his tail played by Andy Garcia looking rather old with his beard.
  Though Confidence has a great, intricate plot that perplexes, the film features many colorful characters, different in a unique way which makes the film even more watchable and interesting.  The film is filmed in flashbacks in the sense that Burn's character is being held at gunpoint, which can be irritating at times.  Though viewing this film is well worth the money, infact I bought it without seeing it and I enjoyed it very much.  I wish I saw this one in theatres but oh well I'm glad I got to see it right away when it was released on Video and DVD.
  Confidence is rated R for Language, Violence and Sexuality/Nudity.  The language can be rather strong and excessive at times, the violence is understated, which includes some gunplay (usually bloody) and fistfights.  The sexuality isn't explicit but it does contain reasonably strong sexual innuendo and partial nudity.  I highly recommened this one.",1064102400,2,1678,4.777777777777778
1905725,3,B0000AGQ2E,"In ""Confidence,"" writer Doug Jung and director James Foley have fashioned a stylish, if conventional, tale of con men and drifting grifters, one that plays by all the rules yet still manages to throw us for a loop every now and then.
There's not much point in belaboring the film's complex and convoluted plot.  Suffice it to say that there isn't a whole lot that's original here - i.e. criminal double crosses criminal ad infinitum with predictable results - but the writing, acting and directing combine to make for a relatively diverting time for people who just can't get enough of these ""Sting""/""Usual Suspects""-type knockoffs.  Jung's script emphasizes humor over violence and keeps us guessing most of the time, even though, when all is said and done, the film doesn't really amount to much.  By far the most interesting character in the film is the man who goes by the name of ""King,"" a crime boss who is bisexual, suffers from ADD and rails against the crudity of life even when he is choreographing illicit sex acts for his nightclub or issuing orders for the rubbing out of an inconvenient rival.  Dustin Hoffman chews up the scenery in the role, giving full rein to all the twitches and tics that have long defined his repertoire as an actor.  Hoffman rivets our attention so much in the few scenes in which he appears that the rest of the movie almost inevitably suffers a bit when he isn't on screen.
Nevertheless, Edward Burns is so smooth, sly and alluring as the handsome young con man that we come to understand how innocent victims can so easily fall under the spell of his not inconsiderable charms.  He receives superb support from the likes of Rachel Weisz, Andy Garcia, Paul Giamatti, Franky G and the always-reliable Luis Guzman.
Despite the fact that ""Confidence"" never digs very far beneath its own shallow surface, the filmmakers keep the movie interesting by employing an intriguing dual-level structure, moving back and forth in time with relative ease and fluidity.

The true star of this film is Edward Burns.  While Burns has always had a pretentiousness about him that I find obnoxious, it works well in this film.  The movie is dry and emotionless, but that seems to fit the plot.

But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is.

It compares very well to ""Oceans Eleven"" but is less swinging, ironic and hip, much grittier with ugly stains showing through the gloss, and somewhat less certainty about the outcome.
As for the story - a group of conficence men pull off the wrong guy, or rather they con him out of the wrong money. Now, in debt to a local mobster (Hofmann ), they agree to trick an old enemy of  said mobster out of several million bucks - and doing this with crooked cops, irritated gangsters and federal agents on their tail. Sounds simple, but like all good sting stories it has a cartload of double-dealing, backstabbing and corrupting gears busily shifting and turning. Rather surprisingly for a contemporary gangster/crime story the violence, while definitely there, is neither overwhelming nor sickeningly self-serving, the camera-work is hands on, and for once the world is at its most dangerous when it looks glossy, stylish and neat.
Of course everyone missed it on the big screen while watching the Hulk, Tomb Raider 2 and Charlies Angles : FT and cussing - go figure.
Just like the perfect con - you don't notice its excellence until it's over. Now wisen up guys and at least get the DVD. No regrets - trust me on this.",1061510400,15,1981,4.895833333333333
1905732,5,B0000AGQ2E,"This was an awesome movie!  When I went to see it in theaters, I have never heard of the movie.  I didn't know what it was about, or even if it sounded good.  But it was awesome!  It kept my attention the whole time!  I love it!",1057622400,,228,3.765957446808511
1905733,4,B0000AGQ2E,"The film-makers got my attention, first and foremost, by the way they edited the plot into itself and out into a projected future. Scenes jump to events that just happened or may happen. And the narrator of the story is telling it all in flashback (but despite the technique a person has no idea how he got into the position of 'flashing back' -- a stylistic feat not too often achieved -- so it wasn't a giveaway by any means). I might have questioned the transitional techniques used -- rough, simple cuts that did not always flow from one scene past or present to another scene past or present -- but the cuts themselves I highly approved of. Perhaps -- but not definitely -- the film is very simliar to ""The Usual Suspects"": story as past tense (up to a point), plot more or less linear and centered around the proverbial heist, denouement rather sudden but surprising none the less. Of course ""Confidence"" does not hold up so well to ""Suspects"": Edward Norton is no Kevin Spacey in terms of acting ability. But the roles of Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz and Andy Garcia, anyway, put ""Confidence"" out there as one of the more fun, more adult films of the year.",1056499200,,1163,4.542857142857143
1905734,3,B0000AGQ2E,"Watching CONFIDENCE was like visiting a fortune-teller just for the fun of it. While not getting emotionally involved, I paid good money just to observe and rate the quality of the performance. And that's OK.
Jake Vig (Edward Burns) leads a gang of Los Angeles con artists that mistakenly burns a local crime lord, Mr. King (Dustin Hoffman), to the tune of $150,000. King retaliates by having one of the team executed. Realizing their peril, Jake prudently decides to cut a deal. Thus, King is willing to forgive and forget if Vig and his colleagues will fleece one of his rivals out of $5 million.
To my mind, a film's potential success has at least four determinants: the acting, the plot, the environment (created by the cinematography, soundtrack, FX, etc.), and the degree of bonding between the audience and the characters. CONFIDENCE succeeds in all but the last.
Perhaps the best incentive to see CONFIDENCE is Hoffman's portrayal of the ickiest, creepiest and most venomous character he's ever played. It may be worth a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the next Oscarfest. Burns, as well as the multitude of others in supporting roles, are adequate to advance the (admittedly clever) storyline, but none were endearing, at least to this viewer. Even the moll of the piece, Lily (Rachel Weisz), is too unrelentingly flinty to be attractive. The only character of any interest besides King is Gunther Butan (Andy Garcia), the scruffy Federal agent and Vig's ostensible nemesis, who appears to be the wild card in the evolving scam.
The director made creative use of flashbacks and visual asides to keep my in-seat interest level high.
I left the screening glad that I'd seen it, but am also going to purge it from short term memory immediately after typing the period that ends this review. CONFIDENCE is, ultimately, an emotionally sterile experience.",1054252800,8,1863,4.993569131832797
1905735,4,B0000AGQ2E,"If you like the genre it is a better than average movie, with enough twists at the end to keep most everyone guessing the real ending.
The theme is how to trick the mark into not following up the theft of his money and eventually finding and killing the confidence men. To this end the movie is great. Mechanism, technic, how to do it are all better than average. Worth your time, if this is your kind of movie to begin with.",1053820800,2,425,4.195121951219512
1905736,3,B0000AGQ2E,"If you love them, this will be right up your ally.  The characters are good (Dustin Hoffman is a very different kind of gangster), but not as great as ""Heist"", and the stage is hip, but no where near as grand the grandaddy of all Con flicks ""The Sting.""  I wish they would have added more detail about the con, as most would agree the devil is in the detail, see ""Spanish Prisoner"" for a good example.  Its a fairly simple scam, of course there is always a twist, and this movie has a nice pace.  If you are a female (I am not), Ed Burns makes the movie worth watching.  Andy Garcia is not in the movie a lot, but he does OK. Note, I think Garcia is the worst actor in Hollywood this side of everyone whipping boy, Keanu Reeves.  He had the world handed to him on a platter after Godfather III, and what has he done",1052352000,,815,4.0625
1905737,3,B0000AGQ2E,"""Confidence"" is movie about the mechanics of conmen, but not their mystery. It's a tutorial, and that's the hitch. What it should show, it tells. Cons are like magic: Offer the secret and the audience just waits for the shoe to drop -- and not with much anticipation.
The title sequence tips the hand: it's directed with style by James Foley, but our con guide Jake Vig, played with smarts (but little charm) by Edward Burns, speaks right into the camera, inviting us inside the game. It's a nice gesture from screenwriter Doug Jung, but a basic betrayal of the genre -- if the audience isn't one of the marks, what's the point?
Vig runs an LA crew (Paul Giamatti and Brian Van Holt) that scores by staging murders during phony drug deals; they rip off the accountant of a local crime boss, The King (Dustin Hoffman), a hyperactive creep doubling as a strip club owner. Vig proposes a new con that cuts in The King for the money he's owed, plus a chunk. A smoky vamp (Rachel Weisz) is brought onboard as bait.
The job is explained once, then again, then executed just about as it was explained. The con itself, involving a bank executive (Robert Forster) and a phony startup company, is pretty mundane,  Jung has an idea to backload the suspense -- will the con work? -- but it's a movie, and Edward Burns is the lead, and since when does Edward Burns not get a good cut from the deck? He even survived in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Will it work? Is there change in the washing machine?
The performances are hit and miss. Hoffman is very good. Maybe too good -- by The King's second appearance, repulsion bursts from the screen. Burns plays his Vig closer to the real thing, but somehow that's less filling -- Vig seems to be working a proof, not a score. Burns was once a can't-miss prospect for actor-director stardom; anymore, he's cast for his looks more than his talent. Andy Garcia is also onboard in a cameo as a sleazy federal agent tailing Vig, doing some ludicrous parody of Al Pacino's performance in ""Heat."" He's never been worse.
Foley, the director, is acquitted --""Confidence"" looks fantastic, and some scenes play better than they have any right to, as Foley bounces the camera around to loosen up dry, talky sequences. The King's sex den is nicely conceived, as is Vig clubhouse where most of the scheming plays out.
It's a fine setting for a good noir yarn. If only the movie were a yarn, instead of a how-to booklet.",1052352000,,2431,4.550228310502283
1905738,5,B0000AGQ2E,"Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is brimming over with Confidence and the cool quotient of a Robert Mitchum in James Foley's ""Confidence."" Like all great Con films, Jake's story is told in flashbacks: think ""D.O.A"" or ""Farewell My Lovely."" We know Jake is dead, we just don't know how he got that way. The success of this type of film depends on the journey the characters take, not on where or when they arrive.
Ed Burns has amped up his basic laidback personality a notch or two to play Jake Vig. And he is ultra-cool and exceeding street-wise and intelligent: he's sexy and more importantly he's able to engender trust so that we are willing to make this trip with him.  Brian Van Holt and Paul Giamatti are first rate as members of his posse; particularly Van Holt who, especially after his dynamic turn in ""Basic,"" appears destined for great things.
It is also good to see Dustin Hoffman leap off of his pedestal to play ""King,"" a man on the edge. His first scene with Burns is a classic: the Method actor meets the natural actor, both men bouncing off each other's physical and mental cues.
James Foley has directed ""Confidence"" with an eye and an ear for the details: his mise en scene is spotless. Even though there are numerous double, tripe and quadruple crosses, Foley directs in such a clear and concise way and he arranges the scenes with such crisp authority... the whole film snaps together without a seam showing.",1052179200,,1420,4.612648221343873
1905739,4,B0000AGQ2E,"This is a good film.  And this review doesn't have any spoilers so read on!
I liked Confidence.  Why?  Simply put, I felt like I was included in this group of heisters learning about what makes them suspicious, how they work, and what they're absoultely paranoid of.
I fell comfortably into the film so much that the heist they pulled worked on me too right up until the very end!  Maybe I'm stupid...or maybe I was distracted by Rachel Weisz...doesn't matter, this film was a joy to watch from various angles.  The directing was solid, editing was for the most part right on point considering that there's a bit of jumping around in this film.
There are some scenes that just stuck because they were executed perfectly.  For example, pay attention to the scene at the bar with the banker.  I felt like I was right there at the table laughing at the jokes and being a part of a group.  That's it right there.  That's why I watch movies, to become involved so much into the film and forget about everthing that takes place outside the theatre.
Confidence is a valued see for any heist fan.  Regardless of whether you think they stole scenes from other movies or not, just go watch it and make your own opinion out of it.  I enjoyed it very much and look forward to watching the commentary on DVD.",1051920000,,1295,4.444915254237288
