8129435,5,B000G8NVQ6,"Excellent second DVD! Fortunately Ashwin lives close to me and when he has time, I begin lessons with him. Good quality audio and visuals are clean. I choose this because I want to at least know how to set, hold and tuning basics without being a complete neophyte. For decades I've wanted to learn to play the sitar. I began learning tablas from a long time student of Ashwin earlier this year. I purchased what I hope is a high quality sitar in Los Angeles this summer. After viewing tutorial on YouTube for over a year, this DVD  cleared up what should have been questions about hand position and fingering techniques. Even if someone is considering picking this instrument up, it makes it clear some good points to consider...",1474502400,,729,4.651162790697675

8129437,5,B000G8NVQ6,"This video is a great valuable piece that every sitar fan should purchase.  It is a fantastic way to start practicing the sitar with various hand movements and scales for the purpose of attaining the right patterns and future skills of developing the art of music in a sitar; it's all about improvising after the video, although it has no music written or notes to play a particular raga (AKA) scale, or song, it does contain different methods to make up your own song.  Its a must have, as well as Sitar Tutor #1 for the beginers.",1142467200,,531,4.463917525773196
