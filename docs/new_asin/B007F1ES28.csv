5080275,5,B007F1ES28,"This is part of 10 films restored (some better than others) by Full Moon as part of their grindhouse series. This film was from 1991, so it really didn't need much in restoration. The opening credits could have been better, other than that, the film and sound quality were good.

This was your classic prison girl film on steroids. The plots are all the same, and no one watches the film for the plot.
The PLOT SPOILER highlights of this film were:

1) Girls are initially stripped one by one.  All the scenes generally include full frontal nudity.
2) The naked women are cleaned with a fire hose.
3) Girls are photographed naked and given revealing smocks/ hospital gowns to wear
4) There is the prison guard Girl/girl forced with Bondage
5) Sold to clients with Rape of the virgin
6) two girls survive by licking the sweat off of each other- Just too hot for words
7) Catfight with clothes being removed
8) Women hunted like animals
9) Revenge on female guard who is stripped and tied to wooden ""X""

One of the problems I have had with this entire Grindhouse series is that they went cheap on the DVD cases. The center holder allows the disc to come loose during shipping. My recommendation is buy a ""like new"" used one and request the seller to tape over the center to hold it in place during shipping.  This is an Italian film, dubbed. Its original US title was ""Caged Women in Purgatory.""",1441670400,7,1393,4.490118577075099
5080276,2,B007F1ES28,Do not order this unless you want a scratched up disc that won't play on anything.  I ordered it twice and had to return it twifce.,1441324800,,131,4.038461538461538
5080277,5,B007F1ES28,"Every now and then a foreign film does what US-domestic film companies fail to do - make a really good women-in-prison exploitation film.  Maybe its because they have so many really old forts to use in Spain; maybe its because they have so many topless beaches from which to recruit hot-looking models as extras in shower scenes.  No matter what the reason, this film has all of the classic WIP elements: innocent girl wrongfully imprisoned by unscrupulous authority figures, humiliating inspections, showers with high-pressure hoses, plenty of sweaty girl nudity, cruel punishment (stripped naked and kept in a cage in the hot sun; bound to a X-framed cross and sexually abused; miscellaneous whippings with a riding crop), and ending the film in a Most Dangerous Game-style plot where half-naked female inmates are turned loose and hunted for sport.

This particular version of the film seems to include all of the nasty bits that were edited out of for certain jurisdictions, and the image clarity is phenomenal for a movie like this.  You can even see the tiny blonde hairs on the bare skin.  Pilar Orive is a former Miss Basque Country beauty pageant contestant and her attractiveness is on full display here.  She spends most of her time naked, sweaty, and naked some more.  The prison uniform consists of a tunic, tied at the sides like a poncho but cut much tighter and much more revealing, so even when a girl is ""clothed"" you can still see plenty of hip and side-boob.  It's easy to see why this has become an international cult classic.  It's the perfect mix of tease-and-delivery.

There are other Women-in-Prison films out there, but none get the forumula as right as this one.

One thing I should note: ""Caged Women II"" is not a sequel to this film.  CW2 was made by a different film studio with different actresses.  CW2 was given that title to capitalize on the popularity of this film.  That said, CW2 is also a good film to have in your WIP library.",1439251200,9,1967,4.747058823529412

5080294,4,B007F1ES28,"As a WIP flick, this one is right in my wheelhouse: Gorgeous women, fully naked darn near start to finish and very light on the violence and gross-ness (which is atypical for WIP films).

I was surprised to see that the copyright is 1991; that's WAY after this genre and died and gone on to the back of the video rental store.  It's Italian and so as you might imagine, the women are HOT. There isn't really a lot of sex--only one full-blown sex scene, but it's a good one. Besides that a lot of implicit lesbianism and sex assault that doesn't go all the way toward rape (more or less forced dry humping). As far as I'm concerned the less rape in a movie, the better--none at all would be good for me.

I was impressed by this movie's high production values: Slo-mo, helicopter flights, gorgeous settings, close-ups, interesting camera angles. And whatever they paid the women to be in this film, it wasn't nearly enough; it appears that they did all of their own stunt work and there was a lot of falling down, hand-to-hand combat and running naked through conditions that had to be very unpleasant.

Overall, GREAT pickup if you enjoy this sort of frivolous nonsense. Did I mention that the women are hot?",1416873600,5,1208,4.527522935779817

Yes, there's that ONE female guard who has angry-sex with one of the girls, but they make it really clear that NEITHER woman is actually enjoying it, not even the apparently-lezzie-guard.  And yes, there's that one scene where two of the pretty inmates are shown licking the sweat off of eachother's bodies for moisture, but again neither one of them is enjoying it because this director clearly doesn't find lesbian scenes hot, which makes me wonder WHY he was picked to write & direct a women-in-prison film?

If you find women physically attracted to other women repulsive, and only want to see MEN dominating captive women, then this is YOUR women-in-prison film.  But if, like myself, you'd prefer seeing a wicked lezzie-warden, butchy lesbian guards, and/or predatory female inmates preying upon the lovely bodies of pretty girls incarcerated behind bars, then look elsewhere!",1415750400,,1142,5.123655913978495

5080299,3,B007F1ES28,"Caged Woman (1991)

A Full Moons Grindhouse release of Leandro Lucchettis 1991, Caged Woman or Mujeres Enjauladas.  This is a late entry of the Women in Prison (WIP) exploitation flicks. As such, this movie has very little else to add after many of its predecessors. The plot has a few more variants in one movie compared with some previous films, but something you will not be extremely surprised: young American tourist Janet is crossed and by incarcerated at an isolated castle located deep in the jungle while on vacation in some South American country. There you the usual recipe that includes a brutal staff taking advantage of the inmates for their own sexual playthings, force the ladies into prostitution, and used as human prey during hunting tours in the wild. This Lucchettis Caged Women is different from that of similarly titled by Bruno Mattei. However, and similar to Matteis film, sex (male-female and female-female) is simulated so this is not a hard core feature. In my view, the greatest achievement of this film on this matter has to do with good doses of erotic scenes, including some very body close ups. Overall, a descent, late entry on this exploitation genre. It is worth no more than 10 bills though.

Technically, a code-free, full-screen enhanced for widescreen TVs DVD presentation. English audio without any subtitles. Extras include a Grindhouse Featurette of interest to fans of these flicks.",1413676800,7,1426,5.033898305084746
5080300,4,B007F1ES28,"This is the truest movie ever filmed concerning the problems of forced lesbianism and hunting of naked female inmates in the American Penal System.

I had no idea that our domestic prisons were staffed by Spanish thugs toting machine guns, or that when caged naked in the blazing sun, inmates can keep themselves alive by consuming each others' sweat.

Oh how I cried when the helpless inmates were stripped and searched, stripped and washed, stripped and punished, stripped and given to brutish men as entertainment, stripped and fondled by a sadistic wardress, stripped and walked around, stripped and made to fight each other in a water-hyacinth choked river, and stripped and hunted like animals.

This documentary also shows the lamentable quality of the standard prison-issue clothing, so flimsy it may be torn off by any passing guard or slight gust of wind.

My outrage was such that I was compelled to watch it again simply so I could be sure that what I'd seen wasn't just some foul fever dream brought on by accidentally overdosing on anti-histamines.

You too may find yourself reaching for the pause button in order to allow your outraged senses to settle themselves.

The picture quality was not bad considering the age of the print, and when viewed through PowerDVD DX with the enhancer turned on it looked great considering it must have cost  several hundred pesos to make. Sound synch was noticeably poor but fortunately there was not much excuse to watch for it.

Needless to say I am a fan of this genre and I have been watching these types of films since I was a teen.

What are some of the reasons why we like these types of films?  Well, for some of us it's not the plot all the time.  Some of us like the fact of women in perilous situations and hardened conditions being liberated and becoming stronger as the movie goes on.  Now if you believe that then you believe that this movie is tame in the Full Frontal Female Nudity front, which it is not!!! My list of things that a movie of this genre must have is 1.  *Full frontal female nudity* 2. *Full frontal female nude shower scene*, 3. *Cat fighting women full frontal nude in a river*(2 of the women are with thongs, like it matters and the other 2 actresses are completely in the buff) 4.  *Lesbian warden that assaults her inmates sexually and physically.  5. *Actresses licking sweat off each other*(Completely Nude) and guess what this film has it all in abundance!

I can name you my top 5 films and the films that could have honorable mention.  ""The big bird cage""(Roger Corman) ""Bare behind bars""(Oswaldo Olievera) ""Women of cell block 9""(Jess Franco) Ilsa: the wicked warden(Jess Franco) and these are my honorable mention films.  ""Caged Heat"", ""Chained Heat"", ""Chained Heat 2"", ""Reform School girls"", ""Violence in a womens prison"" and last but not least ""The arena""(Roger Corman).  If you are a fan of this genre you will love these films as well because we all love how the women are tortured and abused, physically, mentally and somehow they find a way to break loose from oppression....Oh and the fact that you see the female form the way it was meant to be scene in a movie from the 70's. Full Natural bushy pelvic regions, natural mammory glands, plots that are okay but hey do we need them and of course the LGBT committee imposing there will on young nubile inmates... I love you all and I know you will love this film.  My guilty pleasure I know, but art is art and that is what these films are.

This is an Italian production and I would note that the info given by Amazon for THIS version (released by Full Moon as part of their new 'grindhouse collection') is incorrect in stating that the 'language' of the film is Italian - this is actually an English dubbed version!

There is certainly nothing 'original' about this flik - all of the essential WIP plot devices are present - a hot American female tourist in some nebulous jungle-ish country gets 'set-up' for a spurious drug bust by a corrupt local cop and whisked off to the ultra isolated women only prison - where she suffers numerous indignities and abuses, along with her fellow female inmates, culminating in a 'woman hunt' sponsored by the prison's decadent commandant and a satisfyingly vindictive denoument.

What makes this movie stand-out from the crowd of similar fare is the director's ability to nail every aspect that makes these films work. Full female nudity abounds from literally the first frame of the film and is constant through sweat drenched love making scenes to the requisite 'examination' of the 'new girls' and the many scenes of torturous travails that the girls endure. Sweat, in fact, plays a major role in the film's ambiance and there is a stand-out scene where the two lead girls are locked up naked in an outdoor cage to bake in the sun and they 'sustain' one another by licking the sweat from each others bodies!  If there was a WIP based Oscar - this scene alone would win it hands down!  I could go on - but suffice it to say that this flik has it ALL and would be a welcome addition to any WIP collection.

The film transfer quality is excellent on the 2013 Full Moon release  (beware the Desert Island version! - horrible transfer quality generally!) -  the 'extras' on the disk are mostly related to other Full Moon products.  This is the film that Jess Franco WISHED he made - highly recommended.",1383696000,58,2281,4.568627450980392

8515509,5,B007F1ES28,"Until comparatively recently I had no 'Women in Prison' or 'WIP' DVD's amongst my movie collection. Then a neighbour, here on the Spanish island of Ibiza, gave me several. In amongst this donated collection was this Amazon Classic Theatre Collectors Edition print of Llandro Luechetti's 1991 contribution to the genre, Caged Women. It stood out as way better than the others and I believe it is considered very much a cult classic. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did, however, subsequently discover there are different versions out in the marketplace. I mentioned this to my wife, who very kindly bought me the UK 'Full Moon's Grindhouse Collection' edition. This turned out to be exactly the same as the Classic Theatre Collectors Edition. Both are prints of the British Board of Film Classification's 1992 approved version for British VHS tape production and distribution. Apparently, at eighty-seven minutes running time, it had suffered more than three minutes of cuts before the BBFC would grant approval for its UK distribution; this after Luechetti had spent considerable time in carefully editing the film down to ninety minutes that he thought would gain the British censors approval. What we see therefore is what might have been a minor masterpiece had it not been butchered .

Certainly as it stands Caged Women is a competent film, even if critics describe Luechitti's scriptwriting as lazy, merely rounding up and incorporating standard themes from the WIP genre. Even if this is the case, the film looks polished even with the British censor's efforts at de-railing it  and ruining it's integrity. If the film's ultimate credibility is not down to Luechitti's scriptwriting and direction, then it is down to it's two leading actors. The combination of Aldo Sambrell and Pilar Orive  make this film absolutely superb as a war of wills between prison commandant, Captain Juan, and prisoner, Janet Cooper. Aldo Sambrell a veteran of countless spaghetti western brings a wonderful sneering, leering, quality to his performance as the ultra macho, misogynist, prison commandant who gets a daily buzz from abusing his vuinerable female prisoners. Pilar Orive justs sparks off Sambrells character as the beautiful American prisoner, Janet Cooper, who refuses to have her spirit and sense of resistance broken by the degradations Captain Juan subjects her to. It is a remarkable performance from Ms Orive, a former Miss Basque Country, as she is a wonderfully confident presence on the screen despite acting out her role alternately either fully or semi naked for virtually all the film's duration. She gives her character, Janet Cooper, a relaxed confidence and dignity to her enforced nudity that serves as a perfect foil to the macho Captain Juan.

Critics of the entire WIP genre frequently cast doubts on the credibility of the 'secret prison' plot proposition at the heart of most WIP script writing. Actually they are wrong to be quite so dismissive of this notion. 'Caged Women' is set in an unspecified South American country where US tourist Janet Cooper is incarcerated in an isolated prison which has the sole purpose of sexually abusing young female prisoners. Unfortunately we know from the testimony of young women who survived such treatment, that the institution featured in 'Caged Women' is a fairly mild depiction of the remote prisons organised for supposed 'State Enemies' who were merely young female students deemed to be left-wing radicals, or leftist fellow travellers, during 1970's military dictatorships in South American countries such as Chile and Argentina. Janet Cooper is typical of the sort of innocent foreign traveller who could easily ended up in such a prison, had she fallen foul of corrupt local security officials while back-packing through a remote region of South America in that era.

There is a fair amount of nudity in 'Caged Women', but not as much as some reviewers seem to imagine. Aside from Pilar Orive, Isabel Libbossart ( American prisoner Louise) and Elena Wiedermann ( the lesbian, SS-style, wardress Gerda) only four other young women cast members appear full-frontally naked in the DVD's taken from the BBFC approved 87 minute version of the film. Of these four , three make very brief, 'blink and you'll miss it' full frontal appearances direct to camera, while the fourth, Catia Castello Branco, playing the young virgin, has two protracted scenes where she is completely naked and very much the centre of our attention. With regard to the rest of the cast, principally the extras, none are ever fully nude. Most are dressed in flimsy, cotton-muslin, side-less smocks which, aside from bare hips and a bit of side-boob, maintain a small element of modesty despite frequently looking extremely ragged. Even fewer in number are the extras, or secondary actresses, who appear topless in somewhat curious loin cloths. Covering the lower abdomen from perineum to navel, these strange wardrobe items leave their wearers bare-arsed in the fashion of a more conventional, very much smaller, and more revealing g-string. Both smock and loin cloth are merely just skimpy but when mixed in with a few genuinely naked cast members they distract sufficiently to cause the mind to start playing tricks as to how many cast members really are nude on camera.

Just over a week ago I discovered it was still possible to buy the ninety minute version of this film rather than the more common offering of the eighty-seven minute version that resulted from the cuts demanded by the BBFC before they would permit release in the British market. The only problem is that this is the French language version released in France as 'QHS' ( Quartier Haute Securite pour femmes ) rather than under the English language title of 'Caged Women' , is in French and doesn't have the option of English subtitles. Nevertheless, via Amazon France, I bought a copy. My long neglected schoolboy French and recently acquired familiarity with the English language prints of the film meant there really wasn't much of a language problem. Without the BBFC mandated cuts, several scenes make considerably more sense and the whole film hangs together more coherently. Now having watched both eighty-seven and ninety minute versions of the film, I really question why the BBFC bothered having three minutes hacked from it. None of the deleted footage is in anyway objectionable and what has been cut has been arrived at on a most arbitrary fashion. 'Caged Women' in its eighty-seven minute form is a good film. An English language version in its ninety minute form would have been even better, actually downright brilliant. I'm now convinced that Llandro Lucchetti, aided by the acting talents of Aldo Sambrell and the amazing Pilar Orive made the best WIP film ever.",1498694400,,6784,5.1127141568981065
