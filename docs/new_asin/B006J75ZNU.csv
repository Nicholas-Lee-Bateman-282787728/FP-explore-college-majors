4992725,5,B006J75ZNU,I saw this movie about a year ago at a screening In New York City and everyone there loved it.  It's smart and funny and has a great ending.  I can't wait to finally own it!  I wish the trailer was on this page but you can watch it on the Second City website <[...]>  or by typing in BuzzKill at the IMDB website.  A movie this good needs to be seen!,1330041600,3,350,3.8055555555555554

Naturally I hoped not much had changed for the DVD release and sure enough it was the same delightfully dark indie comedy I remembered. I found out it's the first film represented by Second City in 40 years! Definitely recommend anyone with a sense of humor check this movie out! You can find a trailer for it at secondcitysbuzzkill.com",1330041600,,802,7.728260869565218
8499191,2,B006J75ZNU,The dvd was released on February 21st. There are five 5 Star reviews for this film...all posted between February 24th to the 26th.  Take that as you will.,1485907200,,154,4.5
8499192,2,B006J75ZNU,"This film was slow, boring and not particularly funny.  The funniest parts of the film come whenever Ray describes his screenplay to a collection of characters with each character not at all interested in reading it. But those moments, while worth a chuckle, are hardly comedy gold. All in all a disappointing film.",1432944000,,315,4.943396226415095
8499193,4,B006J75ZNU,"Pretty funny ~ not great, but not bad either.",1418688000,,45,4.111111111111111
8499194,2,B006J75ZNU,"With all these rave reviews, I guess my hopes were up too high for this movie because I can not find one good thing to say about it.  The premise is good but the presentation falls flat as a pancake.  I kept thinking, well maybe it will start being funny later.  Even ""black"" comedies should at least be slightly funny.  Again, the material is there but it fails to amuse for some reason.  I am going to have to guess the star is just not funny, and in facts sucks all the humor from the lines.
Also, what is so hard about adding subtitles to these cheap movies.",1369699200,,562,4.166666666666667
8499195,4,B006J75ZNU,"Buzzkill is a little bit like a Russian novel, but with a happy ending. Except that it's pretty funny and, evidently, filmed mostly in New Jersey. Things look pretty bleak for the main character (played by One of Those Guys You've Seen Somewhere But Can't Remember the Name Of) until, at his personal nadir, he's given a glimpse of what might be a ray of hope maybe. This ray of hope allows him to gather whatever resources he has left and drive cross country (another divergence from the Russian novel trope), leading him, of course, to even more ironically-- and increasingly funny and bizarre-- depths of misery. Along the way-- again, the theme briefly departs from your standard Doestoevsky-- the now despondent schlub meets up with a serial killer (played by Darrell Hammond, someone I could actually identify) who offers him, in a weirdly ironic way, the hope he needs to continue his journey. And then there's the even more ironically happy ending, involving the serial killer (off camera), the main character, selling out and what looks like a Ferrari. It honestly feels better than Anna Karenina.

Be forewarned: Buzzkill is not a date movie. There's a very funny scene involving an inflamed testicle, another that captures a bursting sewage pipe in brilliantly disturbing Technicolor and a third that...well, I shouldn't say. Rather, this movie is one that you watch with your college-aged nephew under the agreement that his mother/your sister doesn't need to know.",1331251200,2,1477,5.0285714285714285
8499196,5,B006J75ZNU,"How can you go wrong with Second City's stamp of approval...love Daniel Raymont..perfect casting..so nice to have a movie that casts for the part and not for the ""name"". Funny and smart..when's the last time you could say that about a movie?...if you have not seen it..delay no more..now is the time!!!!!",1330214400,,304,4.865384615384615
8499197,5,B006J75ZNU,"Buzzkill is hilarious.  Protagonist Ray Wyatt experiences unpredictable, unfortunate events that combine to make for a smooth-flowing journey laced with subtle dark humor.  The $20 is completely worth it to own a movie that cuts out all the unnecessary special effects to produce a work of substantial quality.  Also, this movie was 100% shot in film and it's definitely noticeable.  Considering its extremely tight budget, Buzzkill is a home run in every facet of a movie.",1330214400,,473,5.184210526315789
8499198,5,B006J75ZNU,"I just finished my second serving of Buzzkill!  This movie was suggested by a friend, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh and think. Everyone knows the likes of a Ray Wyatt--someone with ideals who figures out that things don't always work out quite the way you plan. Also, brilliant casting, especially for an indie. Daniel Raymont--well done! Thanks for the post about the secondcitysbuzzkill.com! Good stuff. Love it!",1330041600,,439,5.013698630136986
8499199,5,B006J75ZNU,"This is a really funny film.  In a world where we are devoid of really good and smart comedy, this fills a real need.  Well-acted and extremely well-directed from a veteran writer and director.  Steven Kampmann succeeds in making us laugh once again.  BACK TO SCHOOL and now BUZZKILL, it is well worth the purchase.  Check out the website too...there's some excellent behind-the-scenes info: [...].  Huge fan!",1330041600,3,409,5.029850746268656
8499200,5,B006J75ZNU,"Just received my copy yesterday, truly funny. I really like cult comedies and I haven't seen one even close to this funny in a long time...Where have all the good movies gone?",1330041600,3,175,4.5
