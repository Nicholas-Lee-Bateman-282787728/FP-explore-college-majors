4157546,1,B003NF97JO,"I am a diehard Cowboy fan but I can't possibly buy this due to the choice of games.
The 1999 game was a classic and I could live with its inclusion but the 1997 and 2007 games are a joke. In 1997 the Cowboys were 6 and 10, the Redskin game that year was a good game but not an all time classic and the 2007 game should not have even been considered. I don't think a broadcast of the 1974 Thanksgiving game exists but the comeback games of 1979 and 1983 should have been no brainers. How does the 2007 and 1997 games get included before either the 79 or 83 games.",1277164800,23,562,3.982300884955752
4157547,5,B003NF97JO,"I live, eat, sleep, and breath the Dallas  Cowboy's, America's Team.  This dvd has to be better than they one released a couple of years ago ""The ten greatest games"". That one was not even close. This has to be the Dec 1979 game in which Capitan Comeback  Rodger  Staubach came from  behind twice to beat those Redskins of that era, Joe Theisman and John Riggens, Art Monk,etc. The greatest game in NFL history period bar none.  Also Thanksgiving day  1974 with Clint Longley "" the mad bomber"" sent  his own "" Hail Mary pass  to (who else?) Drew  Pearson.  I will never forget the site of George Allen on the sidleine after  that. It was classic. Please don't mess this one up.............",1276041600,,689,4.512195121951219
8401036,2,B003NF97JO,"frankly i am puzzled by the choices of 3 greatest wins by our skins vs. dallas, maybe it would be too expoensive to show jugenson, kilmer when sober etc, recievers jerry smith etc, but to show gibbs when he arrives for the new century but didn't read how the game had changed, and show a game with brunnell and romo? 4 fumbles, a safety dropped everywhere was a real joke, i guess you can't walk out of rfk stadium after paying your life savings, but to fans, don't waste your money. seriously, if you wanted to show people why you loved skins vs. cowboys, these games would getyou certified. i guess it is like telling peple about great presidents and show them bush, trump reagan.",1523836800,,682,4.464
8401037,3,B003NF97JO,"Greatest Game... not games.

Three Redskins victories over Dallas included here: 1982 season NFC Championship - among the greatest of Redskins games for sure! -  as well as 2005 and 2006 miracle finish regular season wins that were memorable but certainly there were many better options for this set.  The 82 Game alone is worth the price anyway.",1517875200,,346,4.931034482758621
8401038,3,B003NF97JO,"Could have been much better. I only bought for the 1982 NFC Championship Game. The other two games were dogs. If they wanted to make this a true REDSKINS fan friendly set 1.) add more games. 2.) Dump the 2005 and 2006 games. 3.) Add the 1983 game in Dallas (Skins 31 Dallas 10). Both games from 1984 (Redskins 34 Cowboys 14 at RFK 10-14-84 and the 30-28 comeback win at Texas Stadium. Skins down 21-6 at half and win.) Add the 41-14 Redskins win at RFK from 1986. The 1987 MNF strike win in Dallas. Week 2 1991 MNF Redskins 33-31 win. The 1973 Monday night game when Ken Houston stops Walt Garrison on the goal line, just to name a few.",1514332800,,636,4.178861788617886
