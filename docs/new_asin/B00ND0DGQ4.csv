6647633,1,B00ND0DGQ4,"Although this is an excellent movie, it would not play on my DVD player. After doing some research, I found out the DVD is in PAL format, used in the UK. It is not compatible with US DVD players. I will be returning it for a refund. This information should be prominently displayed in the product description on Amazon's site. I am so disappointed!!!",1440633600,13,350,4.484375
6647634,5,B00ND0DGQ4,Be careful what you wish for.  An adopted daughter seeks out her birth mother only to find herself dropped smack in the middle of a hugely dysfunctional family.  Outstanding performances all around.  The only note that didn't ring true was the younger daughter's easy acceptance of her newly-discovered sister.,1440201600,,310,5.285714285714286
6647635,5,B00ND0DGQ4,"Amazing smart funny!  Character study of an aging unhappy woman with a miserable life who meets the daughter she gave up for adoption at birth.

6647636,5,B00ND0DGQ4,"A SECRET REVEALED!  A Mother and Daughter ultimately ""find each other"", and more importantly:  find THEMSELVES!

6647637,2,B00ND0DGQ4,"I had this issue as well, did not say it was region 2, just PAL. Are they one and the same? It should have been clarified better. Have been waiting and wanting to replace the VHS tape and thought "" great"". Wrong I was, unless it will play....",1435276800,5,242,4.0625

6647641,5,B00ND0DGQ4,Such heartrending portrayals of a totally dysfunctional family with very human flaws.  Excellent British production.,1428710400,,116,6.733333333333333
6647642,1,B00ND0DGQ4,So disappointing to receive a dvd that can not play in the U.S. Why sell it to  anyone here. I did  return it.,1454630400,2,110,3.739130434782609

6647644,1,B00ND0DGQ4,"I have wanted to watch this movie, 'Secrets and Lies' since it came out in the 90's and I had the good fortune to watch it then.. I was terribly excited to read it was finally available through Amazon.
Unfortunately, it was not to be.  The movie/DVD I received was the UK edition and of course would not work in my US DVD Player.  I did return the movie to Amazon and was credited but who cares?  I still want my own copy of 'Secrets and Lies'.  I wonder if anyone at Amazon will actually read my comments and help me with this issue.  Thank you.",1454025600,7,546,4.113207547169812
6647645,1,B00ND0DGQ4,"This will not play on DVD players in the US.  The description should out line that.  Unfortunately for me, I bought this last summer and, due to some vision problems, did not get to try and watch it until last week.  I can no longer return according to Amazon policy.",1451520000,,267,4.3
6647646,5,B00ND0DGQ4,"This movie is another great movie made by Mike Leigh.
I saw this movie then I watched Vera Drake. I can't tell which one is better.
But the ending, Secrets& Lies is greater I guess.
The director is really good at making good charactor and stories.
He doesn't, I mean never go to extreme situation. Violent or swear someone becoming crazy or something.
But he rather makes situation quielty and slowly built up to the point where it is so powerful that we all feel so touched.
This movie as well as Vera Drake makes me want to watch his movie again and again.
I think I watched this movie about 5 times and still want to see it some day later. It's a great film.
The difference between this one and Vera Drake is this is a happy ending film while the other one is unhappy ending one.",1450396800,,782,4.25503355704698
6647647,5,B00ND0DGQ4,Its a great movie. Complaints and low star rating are due to the fact that the USA customers bought the wrong region DVD.,1445731200,,121,4.304347826086956
6647648,1,B00ND0DGQ4,"And so i bought this dvd last April and never get around to watching it until tonight. To my dismay, my dvd player can't play it because the disc is PAL. Nowhere in the product description did it say such thing. I paid $17.61 for this for nothing.  What a bummer!",1444176000,9,263,4.1568627450980395

6647651,5,B00ND0DGQ4,"(WILL NOT WORK ON US DVD PLAYER, REQUIRES A MULTI REIGONAL DVD PLAYER) Besides the fact that it's reigon is not properly advertised, A fantastic movie and easily one of Mike Leigh's best films. This film details a successful Black British woman who discovers that her genetic mother is a lower class white woman. She attempts to reconnect with her mother, but tensions run high and in the heat of the moment everyone's secrets and lies begin to come to light. The performances in this movie are top notch, and Leigh once again demonstrates his knack for kitchen sink drama in his creation of scenes and relationships that feel wholly organic. I'd recommend this film to anybody who's a movie buff, and people who enjoy movies in general.",1440720000,3,737,4.765625

8677495,1,B00ND0DGQ4,"Love this qirky movie, but it took me over a year to actually watch it after buying it thru an Amazon seller.  The movie is only in format for European use sonit does NOT work on US drive and seller will NOT even refund or replace.  Bad biz practices so Im rating it a 1 for the Amazon Reseller, not the movie.",1513382400,3,310,3.9838709677419355
8677496,5,B00ND0DGQ4,Another great British character study. One of the best. I've watched it several times.,1487894400,3,86,5.214285714285714
8677497,5,B00ND0DGQ4,"Raw views of dysfunctional families. Life as anger and disappointment. Character that ties the families together is a young, adopted woman searching for her birth mother. Heavy dramaemotional, sad, can be depressing. Exceptional acting! This is a British film with British accents and jargon. Heart-wrenching, mesmerizing. Great cinema.",1477180800,,336,6.020833333333333

8677501,5,B00ND0DGQ4,"One of the UK's best films of the 1990s. From the acting, writing, and direction this is a warm and gritty story of the effects of giving up a baby for adoption. The scene where mother and daughter meet for the first time is brilliantly done; Mike Leigh, the director, trusts his actresses, and the pay off is fantastic.",1461456000,2,320,4.440677966101695
