7346506,5,B012BYDKFO,Awesome service and product!,1448841600,,28,6.25
7346507,5,B012BYDKFO,"Awesome movie for Fri 13th fans. It comes with oodles of out-takes and extra footage never before seen. The movie is colorful, crisp and clear. Better than the theater!",1448150400,,168,4.827586206896552
7346508,4,B012BYDKFO,"And here we find ourselves with yet another series of re-releases of the Friday the 13th franchise.

There are no versions of the feature films. There are no new special features. The contents of these discs is exactly identical to those that were included in the 2013 blu-ray box set that collected the Paramount franchise up to and including Freddy vs Jason and the 2009 remake. For those of you who own that now OOP set, there's nothing new to gain from buying these two disc sets.

The practical upshot of these is that if you don't own the complete set, you can pick and choose which films you'd rather have in relative comfort, and it also saves you the grief of the horrifying packaging that was inflicted upon the 2013 complete series box set (discs were damaged by the cardboard sleeve casing, as well as ill-placed dollops of packaging glue). Just be warned that your order may take some time to ship: I pre-ordered the Part V/Part VI set here at Amazon -- those are my favorite films in the series -- and it has yet to ship and is listed as temporarily out of stock. This in spite of my having placed the pre-oder back in July. It seems the sets are selling relative well, then.

If you haven't picked up the complete series box set, you could do a whole lot worse than to pick up all of the Blu-ray Double Feature Sets. They sell at a great price and you get all the content on the full set.",1441670400,,1403,4.347328244274809
7346509,5,B012BYDKFO,"Update 10-13-2015
These BR's do exist the demand has been crazy (so for everyone who has pre-ordered these two disc Sets) You'll get them
Also both films and all the  extras are on One BR disc
(which makes sense since BR Disc can hold lots of Data on one disc)  Photos Below

I was actually gonna buy the Complete Friday the 13th Box Set
on it's release date I went to the local BB they had the set on Sale for $80.00
Found two Box Sets hidden at the bottom of a shelf  the first TIN was damaged dents and dings  (The employ would Not give me a deal on it even though it was really beat up) The Second Tin looked very good up until i raised it toward my face
I could hear 2-3 disc lose and rattling around inside the Tin
So i put it back and said to myself pass
I'm not paying $80.00 for a Trashed Tin or a Set with multi disc being lose before i even open the thing up
Any Collector knows what I'm talking about (That Good Old OCD kicks in) you want stuff brand new and mint!
Needless to say I always avoided the FT13 Box Set 'Cause the Tin sucks it felt cheap and rushed (It was like a cheap knock-off of a Steal Book) and the inside has those cardboard slips (How Cheap and Tacky it that)
I was actually on Blu-Ray.com a week ago reading a Thread Regarding the FT13 Blu Ray Set  (and it's ironic and funny) almost everyone on there said the same thing the Friday the 13th Films will NEVER get a single BR Release ok
they were half right Paramount & WB are putting out the first 8 Fridays on a 2-Disc double feature Loaded with all the extras from the previous Deluxe Edition dvd's and also some extras that were only on the Original  Friday the 13th: From Crystal Lake to Manhattan Ultimate Collection (from 2004) So these 2disc Sets are without a doubt a great deal all around
Like many who jumped into Collecting BR way to early on (Keep in mind I still was collecting HD DVD's) I bought the first 3 Friday's on BR and they are really good the ""Original"" is the Rated X Cut aka Uncut
The problem is only the first three films were released on Blu Ray  (Until The Box Set) which was at least 4 years after the previous 3 were available
Then you fast forward to Sept 2015 and all the die hard Horror fans that missed out on the Over Priced (very flawed) FT13 Box Set get what they want FT13 part 4-8 in Glorious HD

What you get in this Double Feature
Friday the 13th part VII The New Blood  (This Version is the Deluxe Edition) all the Great extras are brought over onto this disc
Special Features***
Killer Commentary Track by Director John Carl Buechler and actors Lar Park Lincoln & Kane Hodder
This is flat out one of the Best FT13 Commentary tracks it's very interesting and fun to listen to! Always liked  Lar Park Lincoln I gained more respect for her after I listened to this track!
Jason's Destroyer: The making of FT13 The New Blood (also very cool)
Slashed Scenes Intro
Slashed Scenes (mostly the workprint footage)
*Mind over Matter: The truth about Telekinesis (This is the only thing I thought sucked through out the deluxe edition) It was just patted on just for filler IMO maybe others will dig it?
Makeover by Maddy: Need a Little Touch up work, My A**  (This was put on here for fun!) Not great but, enjoyable for what it is
FT13 part 7 is simple two studios wanted to do  a Freddy vs Jason film but, egos and money came into play so we
Got Jason vs Carrie and in the end it worked out
(Side note it's strange both studios wouldn't make nice in 1988 but, somehow New Line/WB and Paramount  found a way to do the Friday the 13th Re-Boot! under a Multiple  Umbrella!)
The New Blood works in many ways it works better then the previous entries (The story was slick but, simple The cast was great
Kane Hodder first time playing Jason (This is hands down the coolest looking Jason to Date) Kane's performance helps 110% even the little things like he's doing a lot under lots of F/X
Terry Kiser as the ""real"" monster of the film is interesting
Susan Blu as the mom i always liked her
Lar Park-Lincoln as Tina (She really brings it I'm not sure if this was her first major roll but, she gives it her all She might be One of the Strongest Survivors from all the films) I wish they explored more of her and her abilities but, it's a Jason Flick you go in and wanting to see half naked teens get killed
Diana Barrows as Maddy I like her too she's one of the very few people you really don't wanna see die 'Cause she's likable and very much grounded in reality.... Something you didn't always see in these films
Susan Jennifer Sullivan  (RIP) who is no longer with us  a real shame she didn't do much work in Hollywood!  as Melissa great performance due to the fact there are plenty of girls like her another character  grounded in reality
The F/X is maybe in many was better then in FT13 part 4
all the insane detail to Jason body from head to toe is just remarkable plus the face is just wow  John Carl Buechler made his name in doing Special Effects (Real Effects Practical) Not any of this phony fake CGI
So the look of this film is very real and organic (It's a real Shame so much was cut and pulled back
Paramount had a suit come in and watch the director and questioned anything he would try
I think FT13 part 7 The New Blood was gonna be the film  Paramount used to cut-ties with FT13 Brand
But, it still made them lots of money so they swallowed really hard and kept on
I'm trying to say they wanted to sabotage this sequel but, in the end couldn't
So FT13 part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan would pay for the sins of the Entire Series
The film was Butchered due to lots of odd factors (watch the Friday the 13th Doc put out 2 years ago)
The MPAA at the time had a massive hard on for the Horror Genera
Which is odd Cause if you look at the two Texas Chainsaw Films done by New Line/ Platinum Dunes those two would be without a doubt Rated X
I guess Torture P!rn is ok to the MPAA

Great Film is in my top 5 FT13 Films of all time
The Rated X Cut debate
I for the life of me don't buy into all the people who ""claim"" the Cut Footage is destroyed
you get some of the Rated X footage on the disc (it's rough and it's workprint footage I understand
But, at some point and time  We will get a Legit Uncut version of this Film
I'm sure of it (There's like 3 different version of FT13 pt. 4 ) That got out and traded and sold through out the years
It's a matter of time (People said we'd never get a Legit copy of Halloween 666 the producer's Cut, and we'd Never get a Director's Cut of Night Breed) Both these happened in the same year
when it comes to Films and tv (Never say Never)
People said these BR would Only be in the box set

Friday the 13th part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan
Special Features on the Blu Ray Disc
***Commentary Track by Director Rob Hedden (This track was Only exclusive to the Original FT13 DVD Box set from 2004)  Getting this is a real Bonus I enjoyed this track a lot when i heard it back in 2004! You can't help but, feel bad for him he was given a film but, very little money to actually make the film,  The studio used him as the ultimate scapegoat imo
**Killer Commentary by actors Scott Reeves, Jensen Daggett and Kane Hodder (I'm shocked this is on the disc due to the fact it's such a Honest Commentary track it's very funny and insightful you'd swear it's 3 old friends having drinks somewhere just hanging out! It's Lose and very good)
*NY has a New Problem (The making of FT13 part VIII) This is super interesting mini Documentary on the film!
* Slashed Scenes (cut scenes/ maybe some workprint footage? I forget)
Gag Reel (Interesting Not lol funny though but I could be wrong?!?
Friday the 13th part VIII Jason Take Manhattan
Isn't the best Friday Film but, in it's defense it's also not the worst Friday film
The idea was actually interesting and could have worked if Paramount would've gave the Director and film crew enough money to make a proper film with Jason tearing up NY City
Instead we got what we got I personally enjoyed this film I grew up on this film! It has some good memories regardless of the problems it had.... I'm sure most people who seen this in the late 80 or early 90's enjoyed it too
something happened after the whole world got on board with the internet where people BS and lie when it comes to pop culture stuff they once liked now it's lame or sucks!  just so they can go along with all the other phony hipster trolls
Everyone has to play the part (nobody can be sincere even when reviewing or discussing anything)
As i was saying before i went on and on about the lack of Honesty...
This film is enjoyable if you put your brain outside the door and just watch it (Tons of moviegoers do that with all the Garbage Live action Transformer films) so why not a quick and painless old school slasher
The opening with the Iconic them sound syncing up with the Paramount Logo whispering Jason
i always thought that was really cool (small thing but, I've never forgot about that)
It also starts off with this cool song ""The Darkest Side of the Night"" performed by Metropolis plays over the opening credits (Don't think this has ever been done before or since. This was very ambitious it was coming close to 1990 things were Changing (it's like the writers and Director understood this 'Cause there some things in this film you'd swear it was at least 1991)
The Biggest problem with this film is the time line
Then again after FT13 part 4 the time line got wonky and i mean wonky
as i was saying the time line is really jacked up
the music that was playing over the credits leads to Crystal Lake and a boat with two young adults are making out (They are listening to the same song which is also a nice touch) which leads to the NY DJ talking about the Crystal Lake Students coming to the big apple to visit for Graduation. the dude throws the boat anchor over board it hits a electrical line under water that's also by Jason's body which brings him back to life (Terrible way to re-introduce him) this also comes into play with the time line he's under water missing his mask but, all the damaged he had from part 7 The New Blood is gone you see no bones nothing it's very cheap he's in all green/black jumpsuit  and throughout the film he's dripping water (Which makes sense kind of)
While he is being brought back to life the dude tells he's chick about the story of Jason (we see a quick flashback with a kid who looks Normal yelling help)  Really silly had no business being in there
He gets a new Mask that looks pretty good (growing up in the 1980's you could never find a HQ replica mask but, this metal head finds one go figure) kills the two high school sweethearts then we are off to,,,,,,,
A Titanic size ship
We get introduced to the cast bit by bit
Most of the Cast members were super young  (This was there big break for a handful of the stars)
Kane Hodder returns for the second time in this film (He still does good but, the all around look to Jason is so generic and cheap!
he did the best with what he had i'll give him that.
Jensen Daggett as the main heroine  Rennie Wickham She too like Kane did the best with what she was given (everything about her character really feels a bit different she's Not a 80's Scream Queen she was more like the girl next door she's sweet and comes of very real in this madness  (Interesting side note Elizabeth Berkley (Saved by the Bell & Showgirls)  Auditioned for the role of Rennie  but lost out to Jensen Daggett....  which is very odd looking at the film now you can't help but, wonder how things would've turned out if Berkley did get the part......................

Scott Reeves as Sean Robertson  (he would go onto being a massive daytime star on Soap Operas) he was good his acting isn't the problem i think the character wasn't flushed out enough so his performance might come off shallow
 Sharlene Martin as Tamara Mason  (I thought she played a great bad girl she a trashy coked-out skank who uses her beauty to get anything she wants very hate able all around! Even her name Tamara Mason sounds like a Bond Villain!  Her death is satisfying (but, super edited) i really thought she was great as the bad girl wish you'd get more of her
Tamara's sidekick Eva Watanabe is played by Kelly Hu (who would go onto to do a lot of massive films 10 years later) Now you can catch her doing  viagra commercials at all times of the day and night!
Her death is both very good and terrible the lead up is pure nonsense Jason can now teleport and he does it like 5 times to Kelly in this disco club on the ship. Once he does grab her  he strangles her but, God bless her she sells it Big time then Jason throws her down that to looks insanely  good (This is One of the BEST deaths in the whole film cause Nothing was cut and it looks so good) the lead up just takes away the great basic kill.... During the cast Commentary track Kane mention that Kelly was super young and want him to throw her as hard as he could No Stunt Double was used that might be why the death looks so brutal you got a 105lb girl getting the life chocked out of her then thrown down to the ground
 Barbara Bingham as Colleen Van Deusen  always liked her in this role her chemistry with  Jensen was very good
Last but, not least the great Character Actor
Peter Mark Richman as Charles McCulloch (Great Casting Choice) once you are introduced to him you know you're gonna hate him
he's just the perfect other monster much like  Terry Kiser  was in FT13 part 7
The back story to the film while Rennie was a little girl she was out at Crystal Lake with her Uncle Charles learning to swim
But, she was afraid to go in the uncle mocks her and brings up Jason Drowning 'Cause he too didn't know how to swim  so the great Uncle being a sociopath pushes her into the deep lake water and keeps telling her she needs to swim or Jason's gonna get her she goes deeper down the lake and Jason is in fact in the water close to her trying to drag her down to the bottom of the lake!
She gets back to the boat and escapes Jason
This incident haunts her once she gets on the boat she's having these weird  visions of a Ghostly Jason yelling out ""help me""  (In Present day)
This back story without a doubt makes no sense in the time line of Friday the 13th 1-7
Even if  Rennie  is 19 let's say her swimming lessons (in the flash back memeroy she is 8 years old ) Jason wouldn't have been a kid 11 years earlier  either FT13 part 5 or part 6 would've been around this time
Most of the film takes place on this ship! Jason kills a lot of the passengers
the handful of Survivors finally make it to NY on a life boat ironically
they are able to get into a cop car borrow it to get away from Jason
Start speeding off to have this bizarre scene go down time slows down and Rennie see's young Jason standing in the middle of the street looking all ghastly and Rennie drives directly into a building/wall and the cop cars explodes with  Colleen still in the car killing her
more then 1/2 of the survivors  are killed
Jason is walking around through NYC holding a machete  and nobody is batting an eye (which was meant to be this wink wink as  New Yorkers  being Numb to everything around them! It works but, its a cop out
all the New Yorkers they come across look like straight up meth addicts  (which still in the late 1980's make sense)
There is one massive wide shot of Time Square where the camera pans around all the famous bill boards (Kind of strange that Time Square is not the same Time Square in 2015)
Jason does meat up with a Gang of Punk rock hoodlums but, nothing happens they whip all switch blades and threaten him
he lifts he's mask up to show them his face then they bug out of there quick (No real payoff this was just to add more time to the film)
The final battle winds up in a NYC Sewer  (it would've been dare i say it Clever to have some type of TMNT Reference in this scene) they could've got away with it I'm sure but, who knows
the kicker they have so long to get out of the sewer before toxic waste fills up the sewer (which makes no sense at all But, it's actually kind of funny) Rennie and Sean meet a State Worker in the sewer system he tells them they need to get out of there 'Cause the toxic waste is on it's way he gave out plot info so know Jason gets to kill him (he dies off screen w/ a Shadow and a terrible blood effect)
they run away from Jason! Rennie finds a big plastic drum of toxic waste (Not that big infact the  Size of  a Big Tub of Margarine you'd get at Cosco) picks up the tub/drum whatever hits Jason in the face with the toxic waste it burns so he pulls his mask of
Then you get to see the Worst F/X ever in a FT13 Film whoever did the work on this design has no business in Hollywood let alone doing work for a Adult Film Company
His face just don't make sense it's cheap (They should've NEVER taken off the mask in this flick!
Conclusion Jason is walking like a Zombie towards  Rennie and Sean they are on top of a ladder that leads to the surface
he can't reach them then the film once again takes a left turn down a one way street
Jason talks and starts coughing up/throwing up water before getting slammed with a tittle wave of toxic waste (which melts away the grown up Jason and you see a little boy in  tidy whities  laying in a puddle of water or toxic waste who really knows?
Is he dead or alive???
But, the infamous Hockey Mask floats away (which also makes no sense Since he ripped it off his face cause it was burning him!) The mask should've been destroyed from the waste
Yeah i know I'm not saying much about the naked kid Jason transformed into (It's hard to even try and explain why they did this I gave up trying to process it back in 1992)
It might sound like I don't like Jason Take Manhattan
But, the film is a disaster on so many levels It's a very expensive train wreck
But, it's a film that still to this day holds a special place in my heart after 25yrs.
Damn I'm old!
Over all it's Not at all as bad as some people would like you to believe
I don't understand why it gets so much hate FT13 pt. 5 FT13 pt. 8 & Halloween III Season of the Witch are all Classic Horror Films (these 3 films don't  get a bloody pass or Respect But, films like  Paranormal Activity, Ouija , and all this Cheap terrible found footage stuff is acceptable maybe there is Nothing wrong with Friday the 13th part VII Jason Takes Manhattan
Maybe there's something wrong with you...........

The only thing i find strange about these double disc are Jason Goes to Hell & Jason X are nowhere to be found on a double disc set (New Line i guess won't  play ball or the licensing agreement is done) From everything i've read Jason Goes to Hell in the BR Box Set is the Cut version Not the Director's Cut (it's rated X)  Freddy vs Jason and the Horrid Friday the 13th Re-make are already on BR
So all you young found footage hipsters are safe!
$13.50 for a 2Disc set with lots of Extras you really can't go wrong
The only major problem with all these double BR Set you loose the very cool Deluxe Edition Slip Cases all the FT13 Films had on dvd (It was 3-D art the Art on almost all were very good) Keep in mind this is Pre Scream Factory a major studio doing this was a little odd especially when you consider how much Paramount has Always loathed the Friday the 13th Series and it's fans!
