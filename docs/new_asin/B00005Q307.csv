1643193,5,B00005Q307,"I realize this movie came out years ago, but that does not diminish at all its quality and story line!  I initially watched it on a TV movie channel, and just had to watch it again.  When I did not see it on that TV channel again, I ordered a copy for myself!  Check out the main characters:  the ""mean"" rich handsome guy from ""Titanic"" (not Leo), and the lady flight instructor from ""Top Gun"" (Tom Cruise movie).  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1362787200,6,454,4.294117647058823
1643194,5,B00005Q307,This was a movie that I found to be very enjoyable. I would recommend this DVD to anyone search for a good movie to add to their collection.,1355184000,3,140,4.035714285714286
1643195,4,B00005Q307,"I bought this just to check out Henry Rollins in a faintly ""typecast"" role. I was not disappointed, aside from the same reason Rollins was about this movie: His nude scene was cut down! However, the view was greatly appreciated regardless. The movie itself is a period piece, well done occasionally flubbed accents from Zane aside, and is enjoyable for the story itself. I would have liked to have seen more film itself, because the timeline seems so rushed with how fast everything goes on. Enjoyable movie, I sadly paid more in shipping (still paid under $6 and it got here very quickly) than for the movie itself, but that's just fine with me.",1334016000,5,646,4.675438596491228
1643196,3,B00005Q307,I had seen this movie before I bought it.  I enjoyed it then and wanted to add it to my collection.  I mostly like the actors.  It's not glitz but an interesting little haunt.,1252195200,,175,4.088235294117647
1643197,4,B00005Q307,"I discovered this movie on the TV while channel surfing and was pleasantly surprised. I am a Kelly McGillis fan (ever since Witness) and I thought I'd give it a try. Billy Zane is also a good and yet underappreciated actor. He plays one of a trio of escapees from a prison farm in 1950s Louisiana. They seek refuge in the remote home of a middle-aged woman who has been living like a hermit since her father died.
The character Kelly plays is frumpy and eccentric. She has the opportunity to escape from the clutches of these bumbling escaped cons, but she is determined to stay at her house and work in her garden. Zane is the compassionate one of the three, and he prevents the bully in the bunch from molesting Kelly. In quite a funny scene, Kelly inflicts further injury on the whiney one of the bunch.
The cons lie low while the police search the vicinity, having to deal with a traveling preacher, Kelly's nosey sister who pops in from time to time, and the blind man who delivers her groceries. You know some characters are going to come to an untimely demise. Meanwhile, affections develop between Zane and McGillis. She started to look hot even in her frumpiness.",1071619200,15,1172,4.533018867924528
1643198,5,B00005Q307,"This was a surprisingly interesting film set in the 60's about 3 escapees, one of whom is dangerous (Rollins), one of whom is lovable (Zane) and the other who is annoying (guy from ""Roseanne"").
It's one of those gems that was overlooked by critics, but can easily be enjoyed by romance and drama fans.
Loved it!",1032480000,7,311,4.571428571428571
1643199,2,B00005Q307,"If you want to admire Henry Rollins' bare behind, watch this movie.  Everything else is a waste of time.  ""Morgan's Ferry"" is painfully slow and dry, leaving its otherwise talented cast deficient of an engaging plot, believable character relationships or interesting dialogue.  The dragging story makes the viewer wish for an explosion, or anything, to make it stop, instead of lumping along into the uneventful end.
Also, it is pointless to watch the DVD version, there are virtually no special features; there aren't even chapters, just one long run.",1019088000,2,552,5.179775280898877
1643200,5,B00005Q307,"""Morgan's Ferry"" - a touching story well told and well filmed. I enjoyed the film thoroughly and am going to buy the DVD. If you liked Fried Green Tomatoes and films about the American South, you will love ""Morgan's Ferry"". Kelly McGillis and Billy Zane have given good performances. When I've purchased the DVD, it's going to be in my collection of my all-time favorite movies.",1013299200,8,378,4.742424242424242
1643201,2,B00005Q307,Slow boiler about a group of prison escapees who are stranded at a depressed single woman's home has little to offer and takes way to long to do that.,1010880000,,150,4.206896551724138
