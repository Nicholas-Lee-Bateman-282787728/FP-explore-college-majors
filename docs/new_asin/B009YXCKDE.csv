5373121,5,B009YXCKDE,"American Mary was by far the best Horror film of 2012 in my opinion. Directed brilliantly by Jen and Sylvia Soska It was Raw,Gritty and Fearless.

(Katharine Isabelle)in the Title role as Mary Mason is amazing and never falters in her performance. Mary's Demeanor and tone go from dead serious to humorous and back with perfect precision .

Mary is a Medical Student studying to be a surgeon, she gets down on her luck and needs some quick cash in which along the way she meets some real amazingly freaky characters and gets mixed up in Body modification and eventually revenge that involves her inflicting unwanted Body modification on her foes.

You do not want to mess with Mary that is for sure. She has some help in the form of an underground sex club owner who may or may not be in love with her. The gore and effects are amazing and the film is beautifully shot. In this and a few other respects it reminds me of Asian extreme cinema such as (Audition) (I saw The Devil) etc..Buy this movie and fall in Love with Mary & all the quirky characters that she surrounds herself with..It's a winner in every aspect.",1365379200,2,1116,4.487684729064039
5373122,5,B009YXCKDE,"This is one of the past years most awesome darkly disturbing horror movies, very original and well made by the Soska twins who also star in the movie, Katharine Isabelle is amazing in this film as the lead role, she plays a surgeon who has just got through medical school finding it very hard to make ends meet and gets herself through a series of messed up events becoming an underground body modifier performing unusual requests for cash among other personal vendettas, is very dark and gruesome in everyway and is a pleasure to watch, this is certainly Isabelle's greatest performance and its so good to see her get a role like this, it is scary and very entertaining to watch her, this is a must see for horror fans or anybody into this type of subject matter.",1364169600,19,764,4.543478260869565
5373123,5,B009YXCKDE,"What happens when life doesn't go as planned? When the simple expectations that we set for ourselves and others fall way below acceptable standards? Many of us end up lost, wandering in a haze of confusion and misdirection that, if left unchecked, can put us on a destructive course that we may never recover from. The real world is cold, harsh, and unforgiving, though we are brought up to believe otherwise. This simple and unwavering fact lies at the core of Jen and Sylvia Soska's new film ""American Mary"".

Mary Mason is a medical student, a starving medical student more to the point. She is alone in the big city, trying her best to survive her schooling which brings the promise of a well-paying career. She is dedicated and enthusiastic, but also a little bit desperate. The world seems to be closing in on her from all sides, Proctors on one end and bill collectors on the other. With no other alternatives, Mary seeks a job as an exotic dancer, after all, the money's good and more importantly, immediate. Arriving at the low rent and downright seedy strip joint (say ""seedy strip Joint"" with a New York accent for proper effect), she meets owner Billy Barker, who might as well be wearing a shirt that says scum bucket on it, or so we assume.

Mary is an innocent, in its purest form. She brings a resume to her strip club interview, just in case he might request it. This is the first of many complexities in the film. Usually, its takes a smart and seasoned individual to bother bringing a well-maintained resume with them to a job interview (trust me, that statement is surprisingly and alarmingly true), but it takes an innocent to bring a resume to an interview at a strip club. Not to mention the fact that we have an innocent girl applying to work at a strip club in the first place. Some people may find the entire scenario unlikely, but I've known many young women in a similar situation who end up doing the same thing, because dancing for money and showing some flash sounds much better than sitting alone in a dark and empty apartment with nothing but your thoughts.

It's not only the innocence but also her sense of professionalism that sets Mary's life on a collision course with madness. In the middle of the interview, one of Billy's guys burst in and informs him that they've got a serious problem. Annoyed and angry Billy runs out, telling Mary to stay put. This is the first of many turns in the film. Billy returns, desperate, demanding to know how far along Mary is as a surgeon. Being satisfied with her answer he offers her $5000 cash, no questions asked, for a patch job. Mary handles it and walks out $5000 richer but leaving her resume behind. This almost immediately leads to a second job, a larger job that calls upon all of her skills as a surgeon, and requires her to learn a few new ones.

Once the money has a grip on her, it begins to dictate the course of her actions, and of course this happens quickly. With cash in hand, Mary handles her business as well as treating herself to some new threads. This doesn't go unnoticed by the surgeons at her school, and soon Mary finds herself invited to very swank party. So desperate for approval and overwhelmed at the thought of socializing with the medical professionals that she so desires to be, she doesn't question it and the Mary that walks through the hotel door is never truly seen again.

American Mary is a downwards spiral of a film and I mean that in the best way. It's first and foremost a horror film, but it's also equal parts a cautionary tale, and maybe even a little bit romantic comedy. It's a tale not only of innocence lost but also innocence found. As Mary's life seems to spiral out of control many of the characters whose lives are jaded and chaotic reclaim their innocence and find focus through her. And for a moment they all seem to be on the same page, but the reality is that they're ships in the night, heading in opposite directions.

Mary has a pet bird; it's interesting to note that once Mary accepts her position as a back alley surgeon and moves into a new place that can also serve as her office, we never really see the bird again. Its cage remains covered. In the East, birds symbolize the departed soul, and in the West, the bird symbolizes the saved soul. Mary seems to be Hungarian, and Hungry is considered the transitional country between the East and the West. Which does the Bird represent?  Since it remains covered, it can be thought of as both departed and saved, dead and alive. Perhaps it's a reference to Schrdinger's cat. Either way, the principal remains the same. No, I'm not over-thinking the film, it really is that deep.

American Mary is a deeply effective film. You can't help but fall in love with Mary and want to save her, and she wants to be saved, but won't let you. Like the best films, it will haunt you for days afterward, forcing you to play out scenarios in your head where the sun would rise and better decisions would be made.

Katharine Isabelle is Mary Mason and is absolutely captivating. In the many great performances she has had over the years this is her finest. She owns the character and the film every second that she is on screen, causing us to feel emotions that are constantly at odds with each other, and that takes subtlety and talent.

Antonio Cupo, who plays Billy, the strip club owner is truly endearing. As we get to know him through his actions we find that he is not the two-dimensional thug we perceive him as at the beginning of the film, but Mary's counterpart, a little boy who got lost along the way and is just doing what he needs to do to survive.

Tristan risk as Beatrice Johnson, the living Bettie Boop stripper, kind of represents choice in the film. She is a saint and sinner, Mary's salvation and she could end up being her undoing. Beatrice is a woman who has the best intentions, but whose world is violent, unpredictable, and most of all, unforgiving.

Lance Delgreggo, Billy's strong arm and Mary's protector, is played by Twan Holliday. A leather clad enforcer whose performance may be the film's most poignant, in the sense that he's the only one that brings out the light and Mary's eyes, if only for instant.

And finally, Paula Lindberg as Ruby Realgirl, the ultimate in duality represented on screen. Ruby is the innocent sex symbol, the beginning and the end, the cause and effect and in some ways, the moral center of the film.

Every one of these performances is crucial to the film and I do not hesitate to say that each of these characters is important to the story no matter how large or small the part.

This brings us to the Soska sisters. The girls are wise beyond their years and talented beyond reason. That may sound heavy-handed, but I've seen many many films by many many writer-directors and it takes a very special person, or persons, to make a film this perfect on their sophomore try. The last person to do it was David Fincher with his film ""Seven"" and that was almost 20 years ago.

With Dead Hooker in the Trunk, Jen and Sylvia Soska showed the horror community that they can make complete and entertaining film with almost no money. With American Mary, they're about to show the world what they can do when you write them a check. Beautifully composed shots, lighting that conveys warmth while sustaining the feeling of cold isolation, and layers of imagery and emotional substance, this is a film to be absorbed, and you will do so with minimal effort. A film about hope and love as much as it's about violence and violent intent.

I urge everyone to see this film and support it. An original horror idea by arguably the next great film-making team and brought to life by true artists. American Mary is the type of film you can discover again and again, seeing something new each time you watch it. There are so few of those films out there and even fewer filmmakers capable of telling a story in such a way. I've met the future of horror; its last name is Soska.

For all of the fake blood they used you'd think the ""torture"" scenes would show some actual torture. But time and again the camera cuts away and you're left with just a bunch of fake blood and cheesy background music. The acting is bad, the plot is really weak, and the script is atrocious.

5373207,4,B009YXCKDE,The movie was good.  Definitely a change of pace from most horror movies coming down the pike recently.  It was fun to watch Katherine Isabelle in something that wasn't absolutely horrible.  It's been since the first Ginger Snaps movie that she's managed to be in something original.  The music was pretty terrible though.  It was like an early 2000s movie scored by Jonathan Davis.  I honestly kept expecting to hear some remix of Got the Life playing in the club.

5373271,5,B009YXCKDE,"This movie is just WOW. I watched it after seeing some screenshots of Mary and her fashion on Tumblr, and I'm so glad I did! It's about a med student (Mary) who is struggling to make ends meet, and turns to the world of body modification and underground surgeries to try to pay her bills. After being raped by one of her med school professors, she drops out of med school and pursues body modification full time...making a LITERAL killing...get it? haha

If you don't like gory imagery, this movie isn't for you. If rape scenes disturb you, this movie isn't for you. If nudity or medical procedures freak you out, this movie isn't for you. But if you love movies that are twisted and disturbing, mixed with a good girl gone bad story where the victim overcomes something horrible to find herself and her true passion, you'll LOVE IT. But if the opening credits alone freak you out, PLEASE don't keep watching, for your own sanity.

The music really sets the tone for the scenes. Katherine Isabelle?! Omg! I loved her in Ginger Snaps...but I think this is her best!!! She really takes the role and makes it hers...I know that sounds cliche and it's always what people say. There really is nobody who could've played the role better in my opinion. And although my husband doesn't like horror movies he actually watched some of this and totally understood where Mary was coming from, which shocked me lol. The movie at the end really does come full circle and (forgive the pun) ties it in a sad and bloody bow. Which for me makes its heartbreaking. Great great movie!!!

5373275,5,B009YXCKDE,"I'd been avoiding this film for month on Netflix when it would pop up. I thought it would be cornball but it's far from that. The film has a dark sense of humor and it correctly depicts the economic crisis we have in our country. Katherine Isabelle, looking like a dominatrix is phenomenal and so is Antionio Cupo, who is the other main character. They have great on screen chemistry and another stand out isTristan Risk a fetish model who pot rays the Betty Boop obsessed body mod addict. This movie is definitely not your average revenge film. it's not predictable and I see Mary as a somewhat sympathetic character, you're almost rooting for her because you see how her humanity slowly disappears as bad things happen and she's very shut off and emotionally disconnected. Also the soundtrack is pretty fantastic and while it does have a plot line that centers around the body mod community it's very unlike Strangeland (a 90's horror film starring Dee Snyder) this film and it's characters aren't shlocky or one dimensional, they have layers. The Soska sisters shot this film in less than a month by maxing out their credit cards and re mortgaging their parent's house. I consider this one of the best horror films I've seen since May.

5373292,5,B009YXCKDE,"Great acting, great story, great film altogether- she is on the list of strong women in film that i hold dear who survive and fight back.
I am taken with Dr. Mary. To reference another reviewer, she starts out as an innocent, with naivety in tow, and no idea of how cruel and dangerous the world is. But this transforms as the story unfolds and she chooses to carve her own path (literally and figuratively) through all the horror in order not only to survive, but to thrive. You see her assume her full sense of power and strength when she chooses to exact revenge on those who cause her harm, as though through some form of self healing and to reflect on them the scars that they left on her and her soul. I do not condone violence, but to me the visuals portrayed in this film are all metaphorical and allegorical, and appeals to the side of anyone who has undergone trauma in their lives and fully dedicates themselves to their work, however unique or impossible the circumstances might be. It is a mission, not a career to Dr. Mary. she touched a nerve, and as a result this has become one of my favorite films.",1451347200,,1116,4.3701923076923075

Katherine Isabelle is great as always & her performance here was very good. The effects are good as well & seeing the weird things some people what done is also crazy. Aside from that there is also a rape/revenge plot going on as well. Mary starts out as a regular medical student but slowly comes around to performing body modifications after she hastily accepts a job for some quick cash. The only thing I would probably change is I wish the film had showed more body modifications since that's mostly the main theme I felt there were a little to few shown on film. Extras include a trailer, commentary & a making of. If you want something different or are a fan of Katherine Isabelle  you cant really go wrong with this film.",1442966400,,834,4.52317880794702

5373314,4,B009YXCKDE,"American Mary stars Katharine Isabelle (Freddy vs. Jason, Ginger Snaps) as a medical student who applies for work as a dancer at a strip club to help make ends meet. When a ""medical emergency"" occurs during Mary's interview, the club owner, knowing that Mary's a med student, offers her five grand on the spot to save the victim's life. Mary does, but sure doesn't seem to appreciate the chance for the hands-on experience because she goes home, gets sick, and tries to shower the ordeal away.

The next day, Beatress, a dancer at the club calls Mary after hearing about her surgical skills and need for cash. The Betty Boop-like (and in a very creepy sort of way) Beatress offers Mary twelve grand to perform some unusual elective surgery on her doll-like friend Ruby Realgirl, who wants to become less anatomically correct. Apparently, the cash is enough for Mary to get over her ethical and moral qualms and she performs the surgery.

Subsequently and with good reason, Mary becomes disenchanted with becoming a legitimate surgeon, and quits medical school to become a body modification specialist, working out of her apartment. I won't go into any more of the story or be a spoiler (you can go to the film's Wikipedia listing for that), but if you like movies where only and all the female characters are off the deep end, this is a gem you shouldn't miss. Also, kudos to all those in the makeup department on this one.",1441756800,,1423,4.710843373493976

5373316,3,B009YXCKDE,"what its about: Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) is a broke med student, who is studying to be a surgeon.  She is very gifted as you see in the beginning as she is practicing her skills on a turkey.  To make some extra cash she finds a ad for a job at a strip club, During her ""interview"" at the strip club, she is offered $5000 to patch up some guy in the basement of the club who has been worked over.  Later, one of the strippers at the club gets Mary's number from her resume(yes she brought a resume to a interview at a strip club)  the stripper has a friend who wants Mary to perform a questionable operation for $10,000. Mary performs the operation, and see how much money can be made in body modification procedures.  I won't spoil the rest of the movie, but things happen that makes Mary snap and she puts her skills to work.

My thoughts:  I was really looking forward to this movie after reading all of the positive reviews, so I was a bit disappointed in this one.  The movie never did, pick up any momentum and really take off.  They are some cool gore scenes, and overall the acting is ok.  But this movie never did come together and live up to its potential.  Its worth at least one viewing, but I couldn't imagine watching it again.",1439769600,,1247,4.263829787234043
5373317,2,B009YXCKDE,"American Psych-I mean Mary, starts with a med student (surgery class doesn't exist btw) who gets hired at first to be a stripper than is suddenly sewing someone's eye hole shut, and offers about as much explanation for the transition as I did. She gets raped by her teacher eventually and decides to use her body modification surgery for vengeance. This movie's thesis I think was to show the seedy world of body transformation and the bizarre kinds of people that seek out said surgeries. What it really showed was how narcissistic and shallow they all were. The twins for example wanted a bizarre operation, but all the film tells you of their character is 've are vierd lol'.

Mary was also an appropriate name for our hero because she's a total Mary Sue. She's so sexy every guy wants to bone her, she's a brilliant surgeon that people are demanding for, and she reacts to every situation like the cool controlled robot that she is. I doubt that was intentional but Katherine Isabelle is so stiff in her role that she just comes off as a goth chick's wish fulfillment. The movie's drive starts with her discovering her dark love of surgery but devolves into a long music video of sex and violence without any meaning or payoff. It's like the Soska sisters were flicking their beans at me for the last 40 minutes.

All in all the imagery is nice, there's some good gore scenes, but otherwise the movie is basically goth girls who are way too in love with themselves.",1439251200,,1469,4.581749049429658

5373357,2,B009YXCKDE,"I did try. Mary is too odd to be believable as a medical student. Her classroom appearance/behavior is over sexualized and though I've never been a medical student, I have been a college student and found it unbelievable that a supposedly top student would dress/behave as she does. Also, if Mary is so desperate for income why doesn't she have a roommate. Also, after Mary earns the first $5,000 why doesn't that tide her over for awhile, why does she immediately take more risky and bizarre jobs. Perhaps the story answered these questions later and as I didn't stick around to find out, I missed it. I find I'm getting more impatient with films the older I get and the worse they seem to get, so maybe a more patient person willing to sit through the film would enjoy it. I did skip ahead and saw that Mary dies. I tend not to like Thelma & Louise type heroine endings, the dead on her own terms twist. I thought the actress was good, just had a problem buying the character as a college student. Since that was the film's opening argument/premise and I found it unconvincing, the film never established it's reality with me. It didn't lose me as an audience, it never acquired me as an audience. So for me, it was a fail, and that was before Mary even got into the weird stuff. The weirder the character and her circumstances end up becoming, the harder the writer has to work to establish a believable reality throughout the film, but especially in the first act. This writer didn't seem to know that.",1423699200,2,1506,4.5

I didn't find Henry, May or Making Off particularly good, disturbing, or well written. Indeed, I found Making Off really bad and Henry mediocre at best. But since I love a horror film when it's intelligent, disturbing, and original, I keep trying flicks that I found highly rated in Amazon, so I bought American Mary.

First of all, American Mary's got a hell of a disturbing story and a great performance by Katherine Isabelle. I don't like spoilers, so I just want to say that it is one of the most disturbing and original horror films that I've come across maybe since Hostel. And trust me, I see a lot of horror movies. I truely recommend it to horror fans that are looking for a disturbing flick with a story and a great performance. Second, the film's got a lot of stories going on, specially the one about the body modification scene. This makes American Mary more interesting than most horror films that simply cannot not appeal a serious movie fan.

5373362,3,B009YXCKDE,"I wanted to LOVE this movie.  The story just has too many flaws.  It starts out with great Promise.  Mary Mason is a struggling student with the burden of paying bills and after an odd run that isn't explained at all, her fate turns.  I will start with what I didn't like about the story...

1. The rape that throws her over the edge.  She is invited to a party by a doctor and her professor?  How would they have gotten away with this?  It's not like Mary was a random victim?  She clues that they may have thought she was a prostitute based on her recently purchased items, but that makes them think they would have gotten away with this?

2. The gore, there isn't/wasn't enough of it.  This movie had such an opportunity to really show some gruesome material.  Most was implied.

3. The ending, unless I am missing something, they used a scorned lover of the woman that she operated on.  Someone that was never in the movie other than his observation of the aftermath of Mary's surgery on his wife.  They don't reference what happened to the Dr. that was abducted by the night club owner...at all.

Katherine Isabelle did play the role well.  You're on her side.  She is absolutely gorgeous.  Her acting is a ""cut above"" everyone else's.  Pun intended.  Other than that.  This movie was just okay.  Could have been way better.  It gives a look into the world of body modification but I would NOT consider this a horror movie.  Its almost like they left most of the key information laying on the editors floor.

I gave this three stars instead of two based on the acting of Katherine Isabelle.  That's it.",1421625600,,1607,4.451724137931034

I have ""favorites"" from directors most people have never even heard of. Yes, I'm into all kinds of horror - obscure, mainstream, whatever. As long as it's a horror movie of some kind I will watch it. I guess you could say I'm a horror junkie.

With that said I've seen all the horror cliches. Horror is truly one genre that rarely experiences much growth. The same cliches are recycled over and over again. American Mary is an absolute standout with very original content. There are a ton of sub genres of horror - zombie flicks, slasher, splatter/gore, scary/suspense, serial killer, comedy, with lots of crossover as well between sub genres. This movie isn't a scary movie but fits more into the splatter type horror with some gore and images some might find disturbing. The thing that makes the movie so interesting is the story, fantastic acting, and the writing and character development. Really behind it all this movie is about the dark side that all people have but this movie particularly speaks to the dark side of well known public personalities (actors, writers, doctors, etc). The brilliant writing of this story is what makes it really stand out. The good girl slowly evolves while simultaneously being exposed to the dark side of others and the world itself.

5373390,4,B009YXCKDE,"American Mary (Jen and Sylvia Soska, 2012)

It took me until ten minutes before the end of the movie to figure it out, but once it did, the whole movie (which, I rush to add, I already loved) made perfect sense: American Mary is one of the best examples of modern Film Noir that I have seen in recent memory. I watched it after I had finished up my Best I Watched list for 2013, and so I made the entirely arbitrary decision to put American Mary at #26 on that list; it may rise in a later revision. Yes, it's that good.

Plot: Mary (Ginger Snaps' Katharine Isabelle) is a med school student with a whole lot of money problemsin other words, she doesn't have any. This leads to some complications in her personal life, one of which gets her involved with small-time mobster Billy Barker (Elegy's Antonio Cupo). Billy offers her five thousand dollars, no questions asked, to perform an operation. She accepts, finding herself pulling bullets out of one of his associates. She draws the line there, telling him she'll never do that kind of work again, but Beatress (Darkest Hour's Tristan Risk), a stripper at Billy's club, gets Mary's number and asks her to do some grey-market plastic surgery. The money is far better, and she once again says yes. Now her money problems are temporarily forestalled, but a nasty incident (I'm being understated there) with some personnel from the school bring her back into Billy's circles again, and extreme plastic surgery, it turns out, is far more to her liking than pulling bullets out of mobsters OR attending lectures...

It is well-nigh impossible to go wrong with Katherine Isabelle, who shows hard evidence yet again that she has the acting chops behind the looks. Why she is not on the same level, both in salary and exposure, of Jennifer Lawrence is as beyond me now as it was the first time I saw Ginger Snaps. When she gets the proper script to back her up, she is basically unstoppable, and in American Mary she gets it. Usually I end up dinging a film for the kind of mismarketing this movie got (marketing a noir film as a horror movie), but in all honesty, I feel sort of spoilery telling you this is noir at all, because that revelation was such a key to my enjoyment here. But there's no way I can explain to you why this movie is so amazing without that. Mary's progression here is almost step-for-step the same as Walter Neff's in Double Indemnity or Joe Gillis' in Sunset Blvd. Both of those films feature a lead whose profession draws him into the web that ends up pinning him to the pavement; the same, with variations, is true of Mary, and again, in each case the decisions the characters make seem reasonable, or would if you didn't realize that no decision the main character makes in a noir has the possibility of being a good one. It's a schadenfreude that has always played well with American audiences. The only difference here is that American movie scripts have gotten somewhat more subtle, and more adventurous with the conventions of genre, as we've moved into the twenty-first century. This leaves us open to believing that the noir hero may, in fact, be capable of getting away with it, whatever the it may be. But you know Damocles is sitting just behind the curtain, giggling, with one of the blades of his pair of scissors resting against the spiderweb. And as Cully Sawyer says in the unfairly-maligned Tobe Hooper reimagining of 'Salem's Lot, this trigger has a three-pound pull, and I got about two and a half on it right now. I continue to be amazed that a genre film can keep me on the edge of my seat, even if I'm 90% sure I know where it's going to end up. And American Mary did just that. *** ",1406419200,,3675,4.530120481927711

5373397,4,B009YXCKDE,"American Mary's script is beautifully thought out.  As a spoiler free primer, Mary is a med student who drops out of school and performs illegal surgeries for the body mod community.  Although she is violating medical ethics, as an unlicensed practitioner, she's providing a service who's patrons would otherwise have little access to---and at a high quality level.  It sounds like a great premise for a late night cable drama right?  Most films don't attempt this kind of complex layered conflict.  It is the mark of great upcoming horror twin auteurs, Jen and Sylvia Soska.

With such a well developed core conflict, American Mary's major flaw is how it unravels at the end.  In order to make a this a film sized project, and not a miniseries sized one, the Sisters cut off Mary's story with a flimsy, undercooked villain.  They do maintain a strong core theme however, linking body modification to misogyny and female objectification.  The idea of body modification as a form of personal liberation, with dire and beneficial consequences, comes through strongly, making this overall a sophisticated horror film that aims well above the mainstream.",1403654400,,1150,5.074468085106383
5373398,3,B009YXCKDE,"Young medical student Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle ""Ginger Snaps"") has trouble paying attention in class and struggles to pay her bills. Looking for extra work leads her to an underground strip club and immediately she is immersed in the world of illegal surgeries and body modification.
  When her mentor surgeon professor drugs and rapes her, things really start to turn vicious. Mary's club connections capture the sleazy prof and she proceeds to inflict various operations and amputations upon him. She's also enlisted by a pair of German identical twins (the writing & directing team of Jen and Sylvia Soska) to fulfill their designs of a more ""complete"" bond between them. The Cronenberg-like final result of this unholy merger is never revealed.
  Mary's descent into a harsh lifestyle coincides with her increasingly numb emotional state of mind. The more she cuts into the flesh of others, the less connected she is with what's going on under her own skin. By the inevitable violent finale, Mary's ultimate fate is a surprise only to her.
  The U.K. DVD from Zavvi.com has a couple of worthwhile bonus features. ""Behind The Scenes"" is a sixteen minute assortment of footage showing the Soska sisters at work behind the camera and ""An American Mary In London"" is a twelve minute document of the twins successfully debuting the film at the Film4 FrightFest UK Horror Convention.

 The bonus features on the North American blu-ray from Anchor Bay Entertainment include ""Making Of American Mary"" (which is actually the same ""Behind The Scenes"" segment from the U.K. release) plus the original theatrical trailer and a commentary track by the Soska sisters and stars Katharine Isabelle and Tristan Risk.

  ""American Mary"" may feel at times like just a pro body modification piece but there are some darker identity themes being played with.

5373408,3,B009YXCKDE,"Mary is a financially struggling medical student studying to be a surgeon.  After suddenly losing her job, and having her phone shut off, Mary goes to a strip / s&m club to earn some extra money.  She shows up with a resume (mentioning her medical background) and auditions for a job. While auditioning for the club owner, a bouncer comes in and says there is a problem. Someone got a little carried away with torture, and a man is dying.  Mary is asked to do emergency surgery to save the man's life, and earns enough cash to pay her bills in the process.  The next day, one of the dancers contacts Mary with an offer of another job.  Soon Mary starts making a lot of money performing underground body modification surgeries.  Just when it seems everything is going well for her, she is betrayed and humiliated by some ranking surgeons from her college after being invited to one of their parties.  Mary uses her contacts from the club to exact some well deserved revenge and further her modification skills.  Up until this point, this is a tightly paced, well written revenge thriller, that keeps you rooting for the heroine and on the edge of your seat.

Then, the directors show up for an awful, extended cameo that stops the movie dead in it's tracks.  Their horrible 'acting' and worse accents just completely derail  the movie and it never really recovers.  It's a totally unnecessary 'look at us' moment that goes on way too long.  Why people choose to do this kind of thing rather than hire skilled actors is beyond me - stay behind the camera unless you were already an accomplished actor.  Still, worth a look - check it out.",1392681600,5,1636,4.577319587628866
5373409,2,B009YXCKDE,"""american mary"" is the uplifting story of a perky female medical student who decides to work in a strip joint in order to pay her student debts. instead she gets bribed into doing backroom surgery on a wounded crime crony of the strip club owner, and from that modest beginning launches her lucrative career meeting the surgical needs of the body modification community (try google images on that one). to make sure the basic narrative remains wholesomely mainstream and recognizable to the average moviegoer, this entrepreneurial go getter dresses up in green satin sexy for her first faculty cocktail party, where she is drugged and raped by her sex crazed surgery professor. so naturally she has the strip joint owner kidnap him, yakuza style, so that she may keep him locked in a warehouse as somebody to practice her modifications on. this whittles him down to size long before a serial killer shows up to do a little surgery of his own on mary.

katherine isabelle is convincing and clever in the lead, mixing chipper ingenue and seething victim with exquisite comic timing and expression. the film also titillates a morbid curiosity about the demimonde of bodmod freaks and the things they want to have done to their earthly vessel. but i couldn't decide whether this is a film of liberation or degradation. of course, as a bit of fictional entertainment that's not an issue worth contemplating. but thanks to isabelle's vibrant performance you come to like mary and empathize with her, so in the end you're left wondering whether her life is an arc of courageous independence ... or a sad life muddled by loneliness, money hunger and sadistic revenge.",1391212800,2,1659,4.903914590747331

The main character is exploited by men in power and she uses her connects (her friends in low places) to dish out some vigilante justice.  However, there is the matter of her now having PTSD and being sucked into the vortex that she created.

5373413,4,B009YXCKDE,"""American Mary"" is one of those films that's meant to be disturbing to mainstream audiences because it features a taboo subject, in this case extreme body modification.  It's a dark noir that's as much about turning you on as it is about squicking you out.

Mary Mason (Katharine Isabelle) is a struggling medical student hoping to become a surgeon. Desperate, she decides to turn to stripping. While she's there to strip, her services are put to better use saving a tortured man for $5,000.  And just like that, Mary discovers that she can make more money sewing flesh up rather than showing it off.

Word gets out and it's not long before a Betty Boop-style mostly-plastic doll named Beatress (Tristan risk)shows up to offer a new job: turning Ruby Realgirl (Paula Lindberg) into a real doll -- as in, smooth all over.  And so Mary moves from the underworld of criminal surgery to the seedy underworld of body modification.

So far, so good. Mary unwisely accepts invitation to attend a party hosted by her professor, Dr. Grant (David Lovgren). Dr. Grant drugs her up and rapes her.  He's so egotistical that he leaves her, dazed and wandering, at his own place as if she were just a tipsy date.

This does not go over well with Mary.  Her disillusionment with the medical establishment fuels her new career, cutting and slashing her way to success through her enemies and clients. That choice will ultimately be her downfall.

""American Mary"" is an original film with a twist on the typical revenge fantasy, but it's unfortunately marred by dream sequences and an occasionally scattershot plot that loses its focus.  It's also not quite as horrifying as it thinks -- the extreme body modification doesn't really go far enough to impress horror fans.  But for moviegoers looking for revenge with a twist, ""American Mary"" keeps twisting, and twisting, and twisting.",1389830400,,1866,4.870253164556962

Side note: Since the camera is supposed to add 3 to 4 pounds to a person, the lead actress (Isabelle) must be sheer skin and bones.

I honestly would consider it to be a feminist horror film, as far as horror films go, and it is incredible with how it portrays body modification in terms of how it can horrify and entice the audience. There are a few moments where it feels very strange, in the scenes with the surgeons, but they're supposed to be off-putting and you're supposed to know that something is wrong with them. If you want a rape revenge film that does not sexualize violence against women while focusing entirely on how the woman responds to the rape.

I also really enjoyed that Amazon's product page contains the (relevant?) information that Katherine Isabelle staunchly refuses to do nude scenes which really jibes with the strength and will of her portrayal in this film.  I wasn't going to watch this film at all but I was curious to see how the girl in Ginger Snaps had turned out.  I think that she turned out in what the main character in American Psycho 2 tried but failed to convey - that quarter life period in a smart but not silver spooned young woman's life when you have an iPhone that you cannot afford along with other essentials for your happiness.

This movie is full o shocking and exotic details like Tristan Risk's modified face.  Ultimately, this is a tragedy and a thwarted life but conveyed as some adventure in a girl's life for the voyeuristic audience - and that is exactly what Buffy the Vampire Slayer is - seven years of a promising young girl's life damaged and wasted, really destroyed because she was beseiged by monsters.

American Mary on the other hand is a profiteer in this world with ignorance/amnesia about the fact that the voluntary body modification patients are requesting the same surgeries as Josef Mengele forced upon his victims.  The director sisters actually appear as twins with laces in their backs evoking Mengele's siamese twin experiments as well as requesting that their left arms be switched with one another.  You can see that these walking wounded with their sad alterations especially sweet-voiced but perhaps malevolent-intentioned Beatress show the audience what Mengele's victims looked like.  One ""customer"" has a star tattooed in the same place that Auschwitz's Comfort Women had ""feld hure"" tattooed on their chest.

This movie is about how American Mary is constantly blocked by aggressive males and Katherine Isabelle is perfectly cast because she really comes off like those girls in college with no sense of entitlement but working hard to reach their full potential.  Hopefully, the reality at least in North America, is that American Marys make it - they don't have this happen to them because a real American girl would be on those Orgy Doctors SO FAST - she'd be on CNN and the Today Show within the same half hour.  Definitely, unbelievable and unlikely is that a girl like her would have gotten into this career made even more unbelievable in that she meets a cute guy during the interview and nothing comes of it - he just tries to get syphillis at every opportunity.  She is likeable and friendly in the same way as Ellen Page in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Candy/dp/B000JQWO2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Candy</a>&nbsp;and they both have naturally doll-like faces but she malevolent by omission and is flawed in her agreeing to do a Barbie Doll surgery when many doctors had refused to the patient's requests.  I think this responds to claims that the victims wanted it because as a doctor, you can refuse in the best interest of the misguided patient no matter how much you need the money so is does she represent the non-Nazi mercenaries who guarded the concentration camps and carried out the pogroms?  She DOES wear a leopard fur coat in one scene so maybe the filmmakers are commenting that despite the pleasant demeanor of the Pacific Northwest culture, people underneath it all don't change from their genetic makeup.

Her Barbie patient gifts her with a dress that while green is not the green of Katherine Isabelle's Celtic heritage but the wintry jewel green of colder climes like Russia and the style of the dress albeit too low cut is similar to Grecian, Roman draping and then she is raped in it.

Also, her first foray into surgery occurs after ""Black"" refuses to return to the club and a Doctor Black is at the rape party (Sabines are often depicted as redheads in paintings) who seems to be wearing those englarged pupils contact lenses popular in Japan for people who have snake eyes i.e. more whites than pupil in their eyes.

Throughout the film, the main character wears black nail polish indicative of the Christian Mittel/Eastern European labeling of Jews as demonic and the directors star as the ""Demon Sisters of Berlin"" while Tristan Risk's Betty Boop's character is often in read reminiscent of the Big Bad Rolf's desire for Little Red Riding Hood.  But the main character also looks more and more vampire like as the film progresses and is introduced early-on as a first-generation HUNgarian American so maybe this is a shout out the Huns and Mongols who made life so difficult in the 13th Century for Jews.  In her last outfit, she wears a white dress but her black underwear shows through as there being a black ribbon running across her dress like the negro arroyo where Walter White resides in Breaking Bad.

She DOES wear a leopard fur coat in one scene so maybe the filmmakers are commenting that despite the pleasant demeanor of the Pacific Northwest culture, people underneath it all don't change from their genetic makeup.

The club owner who is a predator preying on female sex workers is played by an actor with Italian heritage interesingly from Bari, Italy - once a major slave port as well as significant in the war against Nazis in World War 2.  Evil cancels Romance, tsk, tsk.",1378944000,,5405,4.9327453142227125
5373440,3,B009YXCKDE,"This is a decent and interesting idea for a movie. For my money, though, the film makers didn't quite know what to do with it.

Here's the scoop. Mary Mason (Katherine Isabelle) is a money challenged med student poised to be a surgeon. She does a solid for a local strip club owner by sewing up a guy who crossed him. The solid gets her a quick $5,000.00. Word of her work runs through underground channels to people heavy into extreme body modification. She soon becomes a cult hit with that crowd. Meanwhile, one of her professors has invited her to a higher-up party where he proceeds to drug and rape her. She has the skills to deal with him. All this starts to get out of hand.

The Soska Sisters, who helmed this outing, have a good sense of the bizarre. Seeing the makeup on some of the characters, such as Beatress and Ruby Realgirl, is both unsettling and fascinating at once. But nothing is really done to delve into the mindset of that type of person. The sisters do little to raise them above the level of freaks. Then there's the story itself. The set-up is good. Poor med student finds a way to put some serious cash in her purse. At first she's beside herself. Then, she not only gets into the swing of things, she seems to like it and prospers. The incident with her professor almost seems like a sideline and introduces a British accented detective who barely performs a perfunctory investigation. And the Soska Sisters show up as twin sister clients who want something really weird done to ""join"" them but you don't really see what that something is. Then the end happens way too suddenly and unexpected in a way that seemed tacked on. Like they just needed to wrap things up.

The gore is cool. The acting is decent to good. The directing and other production values are on par with the project. It just needed some serious considerations at the script level.

This isn't a bad watch. There is a lot to like. It just needs a tighter story.",1378944000,7,1958,4.460893854748603

5373442,3,B009YXCKDE,"This is very different from any horror movie that I've ever seen before.  It's completely unique.  In fact, I'm not even sure I'd classify it as horror.  It's not a movie that scares so much as shocks.  It's more akin to an old fashioned carnival freak show than a horror movie.  The principal character, Mary, is a very promising medical student who is barely scraping by financially.  She applies for a job as an exotic dancer and ends up doing some backroom surgery on a guy.  The works pays handsomely but she sees it as a one time thing and spends days terrified of what is going to happen to her as a result of her work.  Other circumstances ensue which pull her into the bizarre world of extreme body modification.  People pay her to make them look exactly how they want even if what they want is freakish.  She also uses her skills as revenge.  There are some definitely unsettling moments in the movie.  There just wasn't much of a plot at all.  The story is the strange, unnatural surgeries that she performs.  The bit of backstory that you get doesn't really help you understand why this otherwise normal seeming woman takes so easily to this type of work.  The ending, in my opinion, made the least sense of all.  As I said, it's a unique look into a weird world but that doesn't automatically make for a good movie.  I'd say watch it for the experience alone but if you are squeamish at all, you should avoid it.  It is not for anyone who is feint hearted or has a weak stomach.",1378857600,,1491,4.37956204379562

Unlike about 90% of horror out there, American Mary has both excellent acting and an excellent script.  The title character is played w/ subtlety and complexity, the plot line is strangely, disconcertingly plausible, and the ending is truly a surprise in a genre that rarely surprises me.

Self-mutilation and body dysmorphic disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent in our society.  American Mary takes a highly creative look at this bizarre subgroup.

Don't be put off by the movie description - the gore is kept to a minimum.  If you like dark psychological thrillers, definitely give this one a try.",1377907200,2,783,4.886363636363637

5373449,5,B009YXCKDE,"I personally love this movie for its realness and boldness. Its basically a story of how a young reclusive woman who once had hopes and dreams gets disappointed. The story starts off with Mary Mason a medical student having financial issues and noone to turn too. The thing that I really love about the character is how she is portrayed as a independent soul. Mary doesn't need the validation of people she doesn't have a boyfriend she mainly spends her time alone. In the long haul she finds out that the people she looked up too in the medical field were not what she thought they were. There was a series  of life turning events that led up to the one event that finally changed her as a person. Soon after she was sucked into a world of debachery.

American Mary is a realistic portrayal of how people can be judged by there appearance. It is also a good character study and shows that corporate people are hypocrites. They are just as weird and unhinged and strange as the people they judge. Mary had found a new family in the freaks which were very honest and in her corner throughout the film. Unlike the people she worshipped in the beginning and once admired. So as the story progresses she becomes more bitter and numb as time went on. There is one particular scene where you can see that she had held lot in and finally exploded. From the point after someone close to her died she became even more unconcerned about wrong or right. The film isn't really a hardcore gore fest or horrorfilm which I admire its uniqueness. But yet its a realistic portrayal of just how fed up someone could get with life and strike out on their own. The only other film I have seen similiar to this in originality was EXCISION.

 This is definitley worth the purchase if your looking for a different type of film with a good soundtrack. The cinematography is good the acting is ok. But over all a very unique and enjoyable experience. If you want to hear an amazing song from the sountrack check out BOSS & SWAN Raging Bull. The only issue I really had with the film was the ending credits song. I didn't think it was a good contrast with the ending of the film. I think it could have went for something slower and more emotional. Other than that this is a good film I advise to view it on Bluray to get the full effect. The story means the world to me because I am one of those people that don't need people to validate me. I am also to aloner not by choice just because I haven't found the right person to share my interest with. I also work in a corporate enviroment to make ends meet and noone understands me. When I go out on occassion it is amazing to be around people who aren't such hypocrites. Life does harden you over time and you become numb to other people. But this is definitley a extreme case in the film. This is a great film if you are one of those people and totally understand the contrast between light to darkness. It's a good character study for those who have really experienced life and had to take on life as it was handed to them.

I would say I am a horror movie fanatic, good or bad I watch it.  When I first saw previews for this movie I was intrigued by the lead character, Mary.  It seemed pretty badass for a woman to be the lead of a movie where at first (in previews) she is introduced as a slasher surgeon, but as the movie proceeds you find that she isn't some scapulae wielding psychopath, she is a victim at the hands of a instructor, and from there, well you know the saying, ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"".  I would say yes, she might get out of hand on a unsuspecting security guard, but the beauty and mystery to her character is so deep.

5373460,3,B009YXCKDE,"I wasn't thrilled with this film, but I remain very interested to see what the Soska sisters do next.  Horror has plenty of remakes and recycled concepts.  So I was happy to see this film for a nice change of pace and style.  Fans of body modification should enjoy this for what it is.

The scoring does a fine job enhancing the politely visceral tone as we first meet medical student Mary (Katharine Isabelle) practicing her incision and suturing skills on a store bought turkey.  Talented, but finding herself in a difficult financial situation, Mary lets a club owner hire her to play ""mob doctor"" for cash.  This slowly begins to resculpt Mary's moral compass, transforming her from almost naively innocent to readily corruptible.

Shortly thereafter, we meet the surgically distorted Beatress (Tristan Risk), a cartoonishly weird character who pulls Mary deeper into her illegal medical practice.  Beatress and her friends are interested in elective surgeries that are refused by doctors because of their extremity.  As Mary accommodates these taboo surgical desires, she herself desires more novel modifications to stimulate herself.  This swings into body modifications beyond what you'd find leafing through the latest issue of Taboo magazine and she even uses her unique niche skill set to exact revenge on those who have wronged her as she climbs her way into underground subcultural fame.

Needless to say, it's hard to write about this movie without ruining the surprises within.

The acting falls short of the highly effective tone, the dialogue falls even shorter.  It's disappointing.  I really wanted to take these characters seriously but I found it impossible.  I was especially irked by the attempts to depict entitled, egomaniacal surgeons.  It was as if someone started the background of a masterpiece with this especially taboo tone, scored and set so well with an underutilized premise, but then filled the foreground with poor writing and stale delivery.  I thought Katherine Isabelle did VERY well in Ginger Snaps and her small role in Being Human, but now I'm left to wonder if this rigid performance was the fault of her direction or her own acting.  I'd prefer to blame the direction, which failed to impress on several other accounts as well.  And Katherine was not outperformed by any other members of the cast.

This film was written and directed by Jen and Sylvia Soska. They haven't done much and I felt that it showed.  The inclusion of elective genital modification surgery, rape and surgery addicts felt forced.  These concepts are naturally shocking on their own; they don't need to be over-sold.  I really wanted to believe that this was meant to be more than another pervy exploitative shock flick.  But once I saw how Jen and Sylvia Soska wrote themselves into the movie with over-the-top body modification extremists, it was apparent that they were more concerned with celebrating body modification than they were with telling an interesting story.  They may have been passionate about this film.  But it strikes me that they never considered how others would view the film without living life through the lens of their subculture.

This review comes with its share of negative criticism, but I'm also very interested to see what else the Soska sisters can do and what kinds of projects they'll pursue.  Horror has plenty of remakes and recycled concepts.  So I was happy to see this film for a nice change of pace and style.",1375488000,3,3466,5.010489510489511

5373477,5,B009YXCKDE,"Jen and Sylvia Soska's AMERICAN MARY is one of best cinematic surprises to come along in years. Their debut film, DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK, was hugely entertaining and showed great promise. With AMERICAN MARY, the ""indy"" sensibility of HOOKER (which, admittedly, was one of its charms) has been replaced by a mature, comprehensive style. This is a film that could have been made by seasoned filmmakers with decades of experience.

Although marketed as a ""horror"" movie, AMERICAN MARY is so much more. At its heart is a revenge tale. And, like all good revenge stories, the person seeking revenge undergoes a psychological change in the course of events. Katharine Isabelle creates a Mary that is no carbon-copy movie character. Despite the bloody business at hand, there's a vulnerable side to her, a thoughtful side that adds depth to the character and also keeps the audience wondering. If we lived in an alternate universe where the Academy Awards actually meant something, Katharine Isabelle would get an Oscar for this role.

The Soska sisters know their stuff. DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK introduced us to their creative visual style and enjoyably warped perspective on life's twists and turns (emphasis on the twists). In AMERICAN MARY, they up their own ante. If there is any justice at all in this world, they will keep making movies for many years to come.

AMERICAN MARY is an intriguing film from start to finish. It's an original, nuanced work, well served by a fantastic script and excellent direction. It can stand proudly alongside such revenge classics as SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE and I SAW THE DEVIL.

Needless to say, very highly recommended.",1373587200,4,1657,4.971119133574007

Read the other reviews for fun if you like the story spoiled and the plot revealed. But I hate that, so I'm not telling you what happens, I never do.

5373486,5,B009YXCKDE,"Desperation. The word tells a story all by itself. It implies the situation has reached a turning point and something must be done. Something that a person would not normally choose to do. Something that will have consequences beyond the immediate need. The `Twisted Twins', Jen and Sylvia Soska, are two filmmakers who know how to take that idea and run with it in new and different ways. The pair co-wrote and co-directed ""American Mary"" a film that shows a dark and interesting path that desperation can lead to.

""American Mary"" tells the story of Mary Mason (Katherine Isabelle), a talented medical school student whose intelligence and drive mark her for a great career as a surgeon... if she can finish school. Mary's financial situation is bad and getting worse as she spends her time trying figure out how she can pay the bills. The distraction caused by a lack of money puts her at odds with her instructors, especially Dr. Grant (David Lovgren), who seems to have a special interest in Mary.

Mary is extremely intelligent, but she sees no way that her medical skills can help her, so she decides to use her looks instead and goes to a local adult club for an audition. The club's owner, Billy (Antonio Cupo), is warming up to her and appears ready to put her through the classic `casting couch' interview process when his bouncer comes in and tells him one of his guys is hurt. Since many of Billy's activities aren't strictly legal, he can't just take the guy to a hospital. Instead he turns to Mary and asks for help. At first she is reluctant. Practising medicine without a license could cost Mary her future, but $5000 in cash seems too good to pass up and Mary takes the job on condition that Billy tell no one.

Later, Mary is approached by Beatrice (Tristan Risk) one of the club's dancers. Beatrice has a strange look about her, almost like she's a living doll and it's obvious she's had more than one surgery to make her the way she is. Surprisingly enough, the woman wants Mary to help her friend Ruby. Ruby is a fashion designer who has the same, doll-like look as Beatrice. But Ruby wants to be freed of the distractions that her sexual appeal causes her, so she wants to become a living Barbie doll: beautiful, but non-sexual. Again Mary is reluctant, but the allure of the cash is too much. Soon Mary has her own side business doing body modifications for those who can afford her quality of work.

Dr. Grant notices Mary's new found financial freedom and assumes that she's selling herself, which leads him to invite her to a `surgeons party' with many of his colleagues.  Mary is honored to be invited to such an exclusive event, but she soon falls victim to Grant as he reveals the only reason any women are invited to one of the parties.

Now Mary wants revenge and she's in a unique position to have it, but what will she do with a man like Grant for whom killing is too good? Her new sideline offers a world of choices, and her underworld connections help her make whatever she can imagine come true. But as Mary goes further and further down the rabbit hole into the sub-culture of body modification, will she find a way out or will her work come back to haunt her in ways she never imagined?

Jen and Sylvia Soska's film ""American Mary"" is a stunningly inventive film that takes modern ideas of horror and mixes them with Hitchcockian era filmmaking. It would have been easy for the sisters to go over the top with gore and blood just for the sake of shock value, but instead they keep much of the actual cutting off the screen. They show the results, often disturbing and unsettling in themselves, but they leave most of the violence to the imagination. They make Mary's revenge scenes even more horrific as she describes what she will do without the audience having to watch each horrific act. That's not to say there isn't blood and gore. On the contrary, it is there. But unlike many modern horror films that throw it in `willy-nilly' for the shock value, ""American Mary"" uses it as an integral part of the story.

Katherine Isabelle is wonderful in the role of Mary Mason, bringing the character to life emotionally. She comes across as intelligent, confident and most of all genuine. As the film progresses and Mary becomes more entwined in the subculture of the film, she grows to be a dark reflection of the world she's entered, losing touch with her old life.  It's also fun to see Jen and Sylvia appear in a small roll as a pair of twins who want to become closer and with Mary's help they may get their wish and maybe a bit more.

""American Mary"" is a perfect example of what talented filmmakers can do when they are allowed to step outside of the norm. As the over the top blockbusters from Hollywood show us time and again, it is easy for studios to throw money at `safe' projects and to substitute effects for story. What these $100 million plus mega-movies often forget though is that the root of any film, horror, romance, action, or whatever, is the story. Jen and Sylvia Soska have shown they haven't forgotten that, and we can only hope they continue to bring quality back to the screen. So check out Jen and Sylvia Soska's ""American Mary"" - it's a cut and a suture above the rest.",1373068800,2,5234,4.5349576271186445
5373487,4,B009YXCKDE,"American Mary  2012/2013:
Written & Directed by: Jen & Sylvia Soska
Grade: B (Original, Disturbing & Beautiful)

Notorious as any filmmakers in the history of modern cinema, the rabid yet refined Soska Sisters have tazered the world right in the face with American Mary. Known for their unpredictable IFC Midnight film Dead Hooker in a Trunk, these ""Twisted Twins"" have brought about a new Universal monster with the film and the title character that is as precise as a surgeons hand in Mary Mason.

Mason who is a surgical student that drops out after traumatic events and unknown opportunities becomes jaded and forever altered. She is embodied by the lovely, dark and talented Katherine Isabella of the cult Ginger Snaps films. Isabella's performance is powerful and emulates perfectly to the Soska's vision and direction. With American Mary, both Jen and Sylvia Soska enter the ranks of such innovative and original genre filmmakers like Stuart Gordon, Tom Six, Takashi Miike, David Cronenberg, Marcus Dunstan, Mary Herron and Tim Burton.

The proud social statement by the Twisted Twins yet no-holds barred film never reveals too much building a solid foundation of style, distinctive voice, cinematography and shock which is crafted at steady pace. While American Mary's plot could have been developed more and the conclusion less abrupt, the Soska's casting is fresh and high quality with deep, dark and eclectic performances by  Antonio Cupo (Billy Barker), Tristan Risk (Beatress Johnson), David Lovgren (Doctor Grant), and the Soska's themselves who make a cameo appearance in the film.

Overall, the Soska's are versatile in their craft whether its balls out filming like Dead Hooker or the refined, emotional and unique beauty of American Mary. The Twisted Twins show a class and maturity that the viewer will appreciate as their eyes, hearts and minds are put through heaven and hell. Stylish, original, funny and beautifully disturbing is what the buzz is all about and American Mary is worth the time and buzz as it is a film that is perfectly imperfect. DANKE.

5373488,4,B009YXCKDE,"It's hard to find a horror movie that doesn't exploit women, and in exploiting the exploitation of women this movie manages to elevate itself to something other then a hack and slash piece of schlock.....it's oddly charming, in a similar vein of 'May' by Lucky McGee. Sure, you can check your brain at the door and enjoy the tits, ass and blood....but you'd be doing yourself a disservice. There is a lot here.
Katherine Isabelle's performance is somewhat uneven, but I think in the end it works....she is so broken by her experiences and becomes quite aware that the only existence she can't modify to fit her soul is her own.",1372982400,,627,4.657657657657658
5373489,3,B009YXCKDE,"I enjoyed this movie even though it has its fair share of issues. The acting way decent for most of its cast and its characters are fairly well developed. The lighting works well to help develop the dark and eerie mood of the film as well as the primary clothing colors (red & black) used. The story isn't new, but thankfully it's different enough to have peeked my intrest to give it a try. The stories big departure from the girl stripping to performing surgeries was both interesting and a bit of a disappointment. Let me try to explain. Mary is a top notch student and for her to take the route she does and throw away her career doesn't make much sense because of her looks and her body she could have caught up with her past due bills within 2 weeks if that. Now with that said, after her ordeal I can see her going astray to a degree, again she is a top pick who is driven and arrogant. Mary is not what you would call an emotional person nor is she kind hearted or loving. Her baggage makes it hard for me to like her, but I still feel for what she went through. I think the story could have been more believable if she wasn't at the top and could loose so much.  The doctor's interactions with Mary in the classroom were over the top when he addresses her as was the silly hospital scene when she tells a family the bad news without knowing the how's or why's. I found Mary's performance good except for some occasions when she was being serious her tone comes across as condecending. The same tone she uses when she addresses the Betty Boop's character who drove her nuts or others that she dislikes (which is most everyone). My other issues are with her skills, actions and judgements in regards to her medical training and the execution of those practices. Her first surgery was without gloves on a low life druggie who has who knows what???  When she is suturing the incisions of her plastic surgery patients she is using to large of a gauge of thread and her sutures are spaced to far appart.. She doesn't have any of the manatory medical equipment that she would need to preform the procedures that she does especially on the co writers/directors that double as twin patients. At her stage of medical school she was only practicing on her suturing skills, so she takes a huge leap forward performing all those surgeries.  With all of its issues American Mary is still one of the better B movies made especially considering its budget. Tthe writers/directors are on a steady path of honing their skills to a fine art. I am going to keep an eye on these girls! 3.5 stars

5373491,5,B009YXCKDE,"This movie was amazing. I love it in a way that is deep, exhilarating and probably a little unhealthy. It is dark, complex, bleak and humorous. And it is probably the most feminist horror film I have seen to date, and I mean that in all of the best ways possible.

At the shallowest level, this film is about a surgeon-to-be who falls into questionable company when she applies to be a stripper and finds that her med student training is more useful to them than her other assets. As this seedy underworld quickly proves more trustworthy and reliable than her student life, she falls into the world of custom body modification.

And here's where the deeper levels of meaning come in: At its core, this movie is all about identity, actions, and the relationship between them, about finding the balance between what others want you to be or try to turn you into, and what you yourself choose to be. If you do good work, is the horridness of the rest of your character forgivable? Or is it the other way around?

Friday the 13th this isn't. This is a thinking person's horror movie, with ghoulish humor to offset the serious questions it asks about identity and self-determination.

[Minor spoilers here]
Katharine Isabelle is outstanding as the titular character. She brings a subtlety and nuance to her character; small gestures and facial twitches convey tons of emotion and direction, from her initial naivete (who brings a resume to a strip club?) to her later steely determination to the very end to be defined by her own actions rather than anything put upon her or in her by someone else.

Mary's friendship with strip club owner Billy (Antonio Cupo) and his hired enforcer Lance (Twan Holliday) was perhaps my favorite part of the film. Mary's un-relationship with Billy, their simultaneous connection and inability to connect, is poignant and a little sad, even as they both do terrible things. When Mary stalks into the strip club's ladies room late in the film, notice the reactions of the other girls. Tiny touches like that -- they know what's coming, this isn't the first time this has happened -- are marks of the Soska sisters' storytelling genius that masterfully show you the story that has happened off-screen.

And Lance... Lance... Lance is just amazing. Half-mentor, half-protector, he tries to take care of Mary as best he can, in the most awesome, slightly lunkish but always loving fashion. When things go wrong, he knows how to make it all better. ""Titties and shrimp?""",1372636800,,2493,4.799533799533799

5373493,5,B009YXCKDE,Katherine Isabelle is fantastic (as always)! She definitely made me feel for her character. I've watched American Mary twice now and I liked it both times but I think it gets better upon multiple viewings. Very good modern horror film.,1372204800,2,235,4.9
5373494,1,B009YXCKDE,"I am totally disappointed in this so-called horror flick. I pre-ordered it based on published reviews...2 months before it was released.  What a mistake.  The parts I remember most are the agonizing sounds of Mary's cell phone chimes.  If I counted correctly, 37 times this phone rang in the movie...and each time it took away from the moment/mood.  I think the 1-star topper is at the end of the film when the police are more concerned about carrying Mary's birdcage out of her apartment than focusing on the crime.  What a lame script.  In fact, there really wasn't a script and nothing creepy...just some blood-filled slicing (way overdone).  I urge others to save their money.  This is not what it was built up to be.  I am a horror film fanatic and this one does not make it into my Top 200.  This takes horror films to a new all-time low.",1372032000,11,844,4.529801324503311
5373495,3,B009YXCKDE,"""American Mary"" is about a young female medical student (Katherine Isabel) who turns to a world of body modification surgery in order to pay her way through medical school. The movie turns too bizarre right around the middle, and as a result, it fails because of a lack of character development.

In some ways this film is similar to ""Excision"" because is has a strong female lead and focuses the majority of its running time on a bizarre fixation with surgery. ""Excision"" was a success because the audience was able to connect with its lead characters. This film, however, takes a look at the underground world of plastic and cosmetic surgery, and it would all have been spectacular if the viewer was able to maintain any type of emotional connection to any of the film's stars. The cast does a good job, but the script is lacking, and at times, random characters who have nothing to do with the plot are introduced and their actions are often unexplained. As a horror film goes, this is better than most of what's out there, especially in the acting and production department. But this film could have been something special with a bit better script and better development of its characters.",1371945600,3,1193,4.735576923076923
5373496,5,B009YXCKDE,"""American Mary"" is the sophomore film from Jen an Sylvia Soska aka The Twisted Twins. ""American Mary"" tore up film festivals all across the world in 2012 and established itself as one of the best horror films of all time, seriously it is one of the best films I've ever watched! I've seen it more than a dozen times and never tire of it, to tell the truth I'm watching it as I write this review, I absolutely love it!

Mary, a struggling medical student is hard up for money, she decides to try an make some easy cash working at a strip club but at the time of her interview is tempted into making $5000 for doing some backroom stitch job. Afterwards her life is turned upside down as she is offered a large sum of money to preform an unconventional surgery and later is drugged an raped.

I don't want to give to much of the story away because ""American Mary"" is a great story. Katharine Isabelle is excellent as Mary and really helps to make ""American Mary"" shine oh so bright. I highly praise this film but that's not to say it doesn't have a few minor flaws. There are a few scenes that cut way to fast, if your not paying attention you might not catch what the person is saying and that happens on more than one occasion.(MINOR SPOILER: Also the scene were Mary has her amputated victim hanging that gets let go by a security guard, I found it hard to believe that the amputee got so far so fast in that little amount of time!)
Then there's the ending, I won't say how it ends because its not bad, it just didn't end how I wanted it to plus It was like nobodies there than all of a sudden, BAM, he's there. watch and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Regardless, minor things like that are forgivable because the rest of the film for me was fantastic. I eagerly await its american dvd release so I can add it to my collection, so with out really needing to say, I highly recommend you see ""American Mary""!",1366761600,2,1912,4.261707988980716
5373497,4,B009YXCKDE,"I liked this a lot... until it just kind of ended with this very predictable scene. Such a shame when a film is so good for most of its run-time, and then drops the ball at the end. Wasted potential, but the main actress was brilliant!",1366329600,2,235,4.130434782608695
5373498,4,B009YXCKDE,"An aspiring surgeon enters the world of underground body modification to help pay her way through medical school, but her strange new obsession turns deadly when she begins to use her talents to exact revenge against those who have harmed her! Jen and Sylvia Soska return with their second highly-acclaimed Horror film entitled AMERICAN MARY, from 2012. Katherine Isabelle is an absolute knock-out as the sinful surgeon, lending a whole new meaning to the phrase ""Desperate times call for desperate measures"" with her peculiar new career path. MARY is teeming with dark, sadistic humor and sharply-written dialog, each of which are played out perfectly through Isabelle's twisted performance. Todd Masters lends a number of stomach-churning effects to the picture, as well. Although MARY takes us in to daring new territory as we delve in to the rarely-seen world of body modification, its message seems lost somewhere along the way. Having already earned her revenge, Mary's motives become increasingly unclear as she continues on with her bloody business towards no certain end. The film certainly shows a remarkable refinement in style for the sisterly pair in spite of these things, and offers Horror fans a refreshingly original break away from the sequels and remakes that have recently drowned the genre.
