4219016,5,B003XYWIXM,Listen to Your Heart is a modern day Romeo and Juliet love story with a huge twist. You will enjoy watching the relationships of the characters develop as they overcome life's harsh realities. The music and scenery are breathtaking.

4219017,5,B003XYWIXM,"I absolutely LOVED this film. A friend and I went to see it at the New York City International Film Festival and we were blown away. This film will tug at your ""heart"" strings. It really is watching a beautiful journey between extraordinary characters. I cannot wait to get my hands on a copy.",1284508800,4,293,4.444444444444445
4219018,5,B003XYWIXM,"I was fortunate enough to catch this film at the New York City International Film Festival in August and WOW! The acting is incredible - both Alexia Rasmussen & Kent Moran deliver powerful performances and Cybill Shepherd plays one of the most memorable roles of her career. The film is beautiful made, with scenic shots of New York City and Greenwhich, CT, and a musical score that is up there with two of my personal favorites, Good Will Hunting & Garden State. This is a great film, that pulls you in from the start and never lets go. This is one certainly worth watching again & again! I give it my highest recommendation.",1284422400,17,626,4.548672566371682
4219019,1,B003XYWIXM,"Wanted to watch a touching, feel good movie. The whole thing was depressing! Kept fast forwarding to get to the end so I get to the good part, and it was even worse.",1426118400,,165,4.03030303030303
4219020,4,B003XYWIXM,"It's love at first sight when Ariana visits the caf where Danny works in New York. He slipped her a note with his phone number, but she didn't call for weeks. He soon discovers that she didn't call because she's deaf. He's passionate about his music and saving every dime to make a demo tape, and she also loves music even though she can only feel it and not hear it. Though she's 21 and attending college, Ariana is kept on a tight leash by her mother, played sternly by Cybill Shepherd. When her mother finds at the end of the school year that  love has blossomed between these two, she cooks up a plot to sever all communications between them by intercepting letters and e-mails and leading Ariana to believe that Danny has moved on and no longer loves her.

When they are finally reconnected after Ariana's return to school, they are even more in love when a critical disease suddenly strikes Danny. Even though he's ill he encourages her to have the operation to insert cochlear implants so that she can finally her him and his music.

This is when it all starts to be a bit maudlin and unrealistic. Danny deteriorates dramatically, while she heals immediately from the complicated surgery. And suddenly she can speak. Actually she spoke (quite clearly) earlier to her mother when she told her off after discovering the plot to keep her away from Danny.

Though the acting is heartfelt, the story was full of clichs. The part of Ariana should have been played by an actual deaf actress, as there were too many inconsistencies with the performance of the non-hearing impaired actress. Nevertheless, it will tug at your heart strings, and you will be rooting for Danny and Ariana to be together always.",1420675200,,1705,4.6544850498338874

It's not a fast process.",1407974400,,273,4.46
4219024,1,B003XYWIXM,"I had to stop watching this movie half way through, you'd think that they would have made a point of having superb music in this film as it's such a important theme through out the plot. Boy was I wrong, i was completely taken out of story due to the horrible songwriting of every song I heard. The songs have the songwriting prowess of a 13 year old who's just starting songwriting. Really really awful writing, I have no idea how any producer would have let these songs permeate throughout the movie, they should have hired somebody to help with the music writing since Kent Moran clearly didn't have a grasp on strong songwriting at the time of this film. Kent Moran is a much better actor than musician if all you had was this movie to judge his talents.

As for the acting, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't by any means good. Furthermore, the plot was wrought with many cliches. I may have a fairly high cliche tolerance in movies but when those cliches are combined with the AWFUL songwriting, the whole thing begins unwatchable (any kind of musician or songwriter will cringe when they hear these songs). Very disappointed because the concept of the movie is awesome, the execution is where it fails immensely.",1404000000,3,1217,4.608294930875576

4219027,5,B003XYWIXM,"I loved this movie. To be frank, when I initially read the synopsis, I had no intention of watching this. However, due to a lack of options on tv, I gave it a chance. I am thrilled that I did. It is a beautiful, sweet, romantic, sad, and inspirational movie. The ending is rather sad, and does not have a fairy tale ending. I cried like a baby, which is something I never do. Frankly, I question the mental capacity, sensitivity, or humanity of anyone that thinks that this was a terrible movie. The 9 or so reviewers that thought that this was a terrible movie scare me. Is the movie perfect? No! Could it have been better? Yes! That being said, I would easily rate this as one of the best romance stories I've seen in a long time. I loved the music, and most of the songs. It was honestly done, and very inspirational. The music and songs perfectly reflected the mood of the movie, and the struggles that the characters had. As another reviewer stated, the music and songs aren't in the same caliber as the Beatles music or songs. I never expected it to be. If you watch a movie expecting perfection in every aspect, then you will never be satisfied. The movie showed how love and faith can guide you and free you from burdens. It also stressed the importance of maintaining relationships, following your dreams, and being true to oneself. I would definitely recommend watching this with age appropriate people.",1392508800,,1413,4.5234375
4219028,1,B003XYWIXM,This movie is so excellent but it cost $9.99.  What the heck!  I thought this price should be around $0.01 for used movie.  I do not give star but it requires me to rate one star for bad price.,1392336000,,193,3.8974358974358974
4219029,5,B003XYWIXM,I watched this movie on lmn last night and it was captivating from beginning to end. This is a beautiful love story with twists and turns and you never know what to expect! superb acting by every character. Even the sad ending does not take anything away from the movie because the young deaf girl is finally released from her mother's grasp and finds her way in life! worth watching again and againl,1392163200,,400,4.493150684931507
4219030,5,B003XYWIXM,Totally enjoyable. Romeo & Juliet with a twist at the end. Loved it especially the music. Simple with piano only but sophisticated and elegant scores. Beautiful.,1388016000,,161,5.230769230769231
4219031,4,B003XYWIXM,"I liked the first half of the film: the acting was really decent, the filming was beautiful, has meaningful characters, and I really loved the music.

The whole point of the film is NOT child rebellion (like some other reviewers have stated) because ""Sam"" is not a child.  The point of the film is for ""Sam"" to start acting her age and learn to be capable.  She is 21 years old and is severely oppressed by her own mother to the point of complete mental abuse.  The film is about breaking ""Sam"" out of the disabling prison that her mother has locked her in.  While there are many positives to the initial half of the film, there are several red flags you need to be aware of before renting this title.

If you're a Deaf culture lover... this film is not for you or me.  The Deaf character was forced to grow up in an oral school her entire life, and suddenly in her college freshman year she's automatically fluent enough in ASL to warrant having an interpreter that stays with her all the time like a nanny (even living with the family during summer break). The interpreter is horrible, she has zero work ethic whatsoever.  It is infuriating how the interpreter aids the mother in further oppressing ""Sam"".  Lip reading is misrepresented, ""Sam"" seemingly automatically understands everything her boyfriend says verbally all the time.  ASL is considered forbidden and is randomly dropped and used and dropped again.  VRS and TTY and texting apparently do not exist in this movie's universe.  Neither does closed captioning on films at the theater on date nights.  I don't expect any Deaf person to feel empowered by this film, it's more of a damsel in distress film.  Yes, it even has a handsome boyfriend to rescue the dame.

As is the norm: The cochlear implant saves the day.  Again.  I do agree that for ""Sam"", CI was definitely a great choice for her because she really wanted it and she wants to be a musician (she was old enough to remember music when she lost her hearing to meningitis).  But the CI was presented as a form of salvation and the film botched it.  She goes in for surgery at the beginning of the day, and walks out of surgery at the end of the day with the processor on her ear and turned on.  Not realistic.  In real life it takes at least 3 months before the CI can even be turned on.

The second half of the film needs to be its own movie.  Or just not exist at all.  Even the final ending theme song that was supposed to tie everything together needs to not exist.  Compared to the really good music in the beginning of the film, the ending theme music was really weak.  There's too much drama for anyone to handle in this secondary plot.  If you have a heart, or if you cried through ""My Sister's Keeper"" you will bawl your eyes out at least 10 times.  You have been warned!",1385078400,,2802,4.409356725146199
4219032,1,B003XYWIXM,Not happy with this one. There is no subtitles which is not good as I am deaf myself. I only watch it for 10 mins not understanding what they are saying so I switch it off.,1382486400,,172,3.8055555555555554

4219035,5,B003XYWIXM,"This movie displayed that love has no limitations and that anything is possible.  I first seen this movie on Lifetime Station and instantly had to get it.  I knew television cuts out parts due to time, commercials, etc.  Seeing the movie in its entirely was really great.
It's about young people with dreams.  Both have some type of reason why they have not chose to follow their dreams and goals.  But as fate has it.......... eventually they fight to get what they want.  They reach far and wide and have disagreements along the way with other family members, still there love hangs on a thread or a piece of yarn.  As the movie goes on, they unite in a powerful way.  I don't want to say what causes it, because I don't want to give away the movie.  But if you enjoy laughing, crying, getting upset.... well this is the movie for you.  It touches on all emotions.  The actors and actresses, truly play their part and make you will feel yourself getting involved or pulled in.  This movie also makes you ask yourself "" What if ?"", "" What would I change ?"", "" What would I do ?""

Danny is a waiter at a local restaurant when Ariana and her controlling mother and her companion stop in for lunch. Ariana's mother is controlling of her  because Ariana is deaf and feels she needs to make all of her daughter's decisions for her even though she is 21! It is love at first sight for Danny, although Ariana's mother doesn't think Danny is good enough for Ariana and does whatever she can to keep them apart. Kent Moran also performs his own music in this movie which is great! There are a couple more twists to this movie that I don't want to give away.

4219047,1,B003XYWIXM,"Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap. As in a Festival of Crap. As in craptacular. As in a movie that would make Plan Nine From Outer Space look like Fellini and Dunston Checks In look like Woody Allen's finest creations. I personally cannot imagine how anyone with the IQ of a rhesus monkey would give this movie two stars, let alone five. I'm guessing that the cast members desperately e-mailed their moms and begged them to write bogus reviews on Amazone. Either that or an army of zombie reviewers, the clones of Rex Reed, are out there on the loose, writing wildly enthusiastic reviews of anything that was shot even remotely in focus.

I mean, if someone ever told me they liked this movie, I would immediately begin looking for their lobotomy scars. Shall I number just a few of the reasons? 1) Miserable, whiny music throughout the entire abomination that makes the Free Credit Report Dot Com band sound like the freaking Beatles and Rolling Stones all rolled into one. 2) Terrible plot with too many twists and turns--and yet completely and utterly predictable at the same time. 3) Cardboard characters, with Cybil Shepard playing a crazed mother, probably channeling her on-screen rage by thinking of her agent and wondering how she was roped into this woofer. 4) Possibly the worst dialog I've ever heard in a movie. Honestly, I've seen third grade Christmas pageants with better lines.

My God. I cannot believe I watched this craptacular thing, and am seriously considering divorcing my wife for choosing this on Netflix, no matter how many times she apologizes to me. Mind you, I NEVER write movie reviews on Amazon, let alone dish the dirt on ones this bad. But I feel I have a duty to humanity and to you, my fellow movie enthusiast. Listen To Your Heart will be 100 minutes of your life that you'll never get back again, precious time that will be better spent watching another movie, helping the poor, mowing your grass, rearranging your sock drawer, or even downloading midget porn for your later satisfaction.

4219051,5,B003XYWIXM,"I loved the movie because it was very decent. In a day when you cannot watch a movie, even a romantic film without there being indecency it was pretty decent. I loved the movie because Danny was very selfless in his love for Sam and they were very committed to one another. I loved that he was very respectful towards her and that he lived life to the fullest. He did not take anything for granted and he never complained. He was very grateful for what he had. And the world was a better place because of him. He influenced so many people- even his boss quit drinking and he was an inspiration. He taught Sam to be independent and to grow up which she needed to do. Her mother was very controlling, maybe as a result of overcompensating for the loss of Sam's dad. But it was not a healthy love. The way Danny loved Sam allowed her to become all that she could be and to live to her fullest potential.

It does have a anti-parent feel to it that wants to make you believe you  can do better without them but let me warn you about getting your messages about life from Hollywood you can  only go as high as humans can go in their presentation. Just human love, sucess, and music is not enough to live by especially when facing death you certainly need something higher than yourself in both cases.

4219056,1,B003XYWIXM,"The synopsis for this film was so intriguing I had to rent it.

After watching it, I can't decide which was worse - the writing or the acting.  I'm going to have to go for the writing, since clever and creative writing very, often saves shoddy acting abilities.  Oh wait, there was also painful musical numbers.  Wow, this is a tough one.  I'll stick with the writing.

What could have been a very interesting premise, was shot down by glib, cliche, canned and mediocre dialogue.  It started out with a glimmer of hope and quickly sank in a pool of woes.  Think of it as a one hour and forty minute cross section of a really bad soap opera, then throw in some really bad music and singing and that about covers it.

Poor, yet heroic waiter with aspirations of being a song writer meets beautiful, rich deaf girl with a monster, control freak mother who doesn't want them to see each other.  Once that turmoil is resolved then one of the characters instantly comes down with a terminal illness with all the typical scenes that go along with that. No, I'm not kidding.

Best to say it's a mix of ""Fame"" within the setting of ""The Days of Our Lives"" and an ending laced with  ""A Walk to Remember,"" without the eloquence, depth or talent of either.  If I could take back my rental fee I would.  AND they are trying to recommend the musical CD that goes along with this film!  That would also have to be a NO.

I strongly suspect that the positive reviews for this movie were ballot-stuffed by the filmmakers.",1302307200,,541,4.316831683168317

I chose it based on reviews, but I just can't believe that anyone, let alone a majority, could give this 5 stars.  Beware of this one unless you like sappy, poorly acted, unrealistic films, with really bad music.  I hung in there until the end waiting for it to get better, but it just kept nose-diving deeper and deeper.",1300492800,5,458,4.440476190476191

2. The overbearing to the point of unbelievable mother

4. When he goes into convulsions on the floor, I thought, here we go, he's dying of cancer, sure nuff

Worst movie I've seen in a while, then again, I'm not female, nor under the age of 16.",1300147200,11,349,4.3538461538461535
4219064,5,B003XYWIXM,"I cannot say enough good things about the beautifully written story and the wonderful compositions from writer/actor/composer/producer Kent Moran, but gifted and talented would be 2.

This movie is an incredibly woven tale of friendship and love and the wonderful way that music can be felt, not just heard, from our hearts, no matter if we do not even have the ability to hear it with our ears.

The plot develops with a story of a young man who lost his mom.  We are not initially then told the specific type of this particularly terminal illness, only that he nursed her til her through as she fought a five-year long battle with cancer.

We fall in love with this gentle, heartwarming, positive, compassionate soul who's life was changed by a woman who endured so much and remained so grateful for life each day she struggled. He works with his best bud as a waiter at a cafe  and saves every dime he can spare for recording equipment to record his first demo.  He dreams big and works hard at his job to save for his dream, but he does more, he inspires others by his presence, his positivity and his sheer and utter determination to follow his goal of making music that would last forever in people's hearts.

Yes, ***spoiler alert***the ending is definitely a tearjerker but the whole story put together is one of the few stories that changes you, makes you think and appreciate the little things more after watching it. This movie is truly art and I look forward to Mr. Moran's deeper foray into the music world also one day, he has talent and gift that should be shared.",1300147200,6,1579,4.5583038869257955

4219067,5,B003XYWIXM,"Great movie filmed in New York, directed by Matt Thompson and written by Kent Moran. Scenes were filmed with the 'Red Cam' so it feels like you're right there with the actors. It's a great story about a high society deaf girl (controlled by her mother) and an ordinary 'Joe' (who works for a living) who fall in love. His dream is music and so is hers, even though she can't hear. Make sure to have your tissue ready for it will tug at your heart and the tears will come.
It has won many awards in the film festivals throughout the US, one which was 'Best Director' at the Beverly Hills Film Festival.
It's another Love Story movie worth watching.",1289088000,2,647,4.355371900826446

8408583,4,B003XYWIXM,"Overall, this is a moving piece about following your heart and loving in a self-giving way. Through his character, Danny exhibits signs of self-sacrifice, chaste love, and forgiveness, all attributes that are disappointingly muted in our world.  I disagree with the writer/director's foray into an alcohol-soaked evening (21st birthday) and the later implied fornication in the hospital room, although these are believable and handled with gentleness. Why is their love chaste until this scene in the hospital? Love, although clearly indicated as true throughout, does not have to result in sex. The hospital love scene could have been presented in a more mutually self-giving way that remained chaste. But there are many more poignant points throughout this film that merit watching it.  I especially like the transformation of Danny's friend (later his brother), who goes from the doubtful, world-seeking voice to a voice of faith and belief in something more than the tangible treasure of the world. Love, as a theme, permeates the film, but it is not just the ""eros"" love of romance and desire, although that is present between Danny and Sam.  It is the ""phileo"" and ""agape"" love that we notice in Danny, a love of giving, a love of brotherhood and sisterhood, that makes this film stand strong. Watch this gem of a film; you won't regret it.",1463875200,,1346,5.054054054054054
8408584,1,B003XYWIXM,"I like romantic movies. But I must say this movie is one of the worse movies ever. So cliche. Rich deaf girl falls in love with poor guy. Rich mother ruins their relationship using the most unlawful and most hideous ways possible. Mother finds her another boyfriend, but this time a rich guy, that turns out to be a sexuallly sick person. After the mother demostrates to everyone that she may as well be the devil the poor guy develops cancer. All in all and for me this movie is absurd and so negative that it is depresing.",1458864000,,524,4.357142857142857
