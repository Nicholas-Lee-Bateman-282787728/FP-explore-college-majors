2614119,3,B000GIXEX6,"Maya's Soul is the gritty urban story of a vulnerable young woman and the dangerous forces that enter her fragile life. From homelessness to forced prostitution to her escape back to safe alternatives, Maya's Soul is the battle for Maya's heart, mind, and salvation.",1168300800,7,266,5.068181818181818
8132855,5,B000GIXEX6,"I enjoy watching Danny Glover productions.  All of his movies are a literal hoot to watch!  ""The Woods of Evil,"" and ""Street Revenge"" both have the same actors, and they're both completely foolish.  They incorporate poor lighting, poor sets, ridiculous themes, and the acting is so adolescent it's incredible.  Regardless, I find myself watching them over and over when I get bored and feel the need to brighten-up my day.  In my opinion ""Maya's Soul"" is of the same ilk, but I'll continue to buy movies directed by Danny Glover.",1504656000,,529,4.833333333333333
8132856,5,B000GIXEX6,I love to collect black movies. This was a little B rated as far as quality of the film but it was a good movie one to rewatch over and over. Really good movie,1389916800,,159,3.7058823529411766
8132857,5,B000GIXEX6,I think nicholl Jones played a excellent role. I liked the homeless guy (Jammie Vhez) who really cared for this young girl nicholl jones who house got burnt up and she lost her mother. Her father dies in atlanta. I liked the girl who played Althea. Althea was like mya's mom and the homeless guy was like her dad and they really loved each other. In my opinion nicholl told her nationality in the movie as well. I hope alot of more people buy it because it is a good movie. I watch it everyday. Im going to get some more movies of Nicholl Jones.  I currently have bottom out and Maya's soul. There is another one i am going to get as well. Nicholl JOnes do look good. She sexy and fine. I love nicholl jones she is one of my favorite actors.,1386201600,,741,4.145833333333333

The movie seemed cheaply made...
It was a good story line
The sound quality poor",1365638400,,113,4.7
8132859,5,B000GIXEX6,"This is a good movie.  It is shot on a low budget but the acting is good and the plot keeps it interesting.  I would recommend this to anyone, it's worth watching.",1303603200,,163,4.0625
8132860,5,B000GIXEX6,"I had seen this movie before and wanted it so i went in search of and found it here. this is a great movie about being at the bottom and selfless people lending a helping hand that makes the difference. People who can be nonjudgemental and encouraging, and someone working hard to get back to a 'normal' life.",1283904000,,309,4.344827586206897
8132861,1,B000GIXEX6,"A well-meaning message movie, poorly executed, that's how I'd explain this unfortunate little feature. The acting is horrible. The storyline is heavy-handed but somewhat believable -- or rather, forgivable. The main actress, Nicholl Jones, has potential but simply needs a few more rounds of acting lessons and the guidance of a competent director, anyone but Conrad Glover -- who quite simply doesn't know what he's doing. Jaime Velez plays the homeless, mentally-ill character who befriends protagonist Maya; he is perhaps the worst thing in the movie. He is annoying. He is difficult to watch. His acting -- or lack thereof -- makes him difficult to believe and, ultimately, the most pressing reason not to rent this mess of a movie. Rashawn Underdue as the project's darkest character, a ruthless pimp, provides its brightest glimpse of a sound, well-executed performance. Underdue can act; his numerous film credits indicate someone else agrees with me. I enjoyed watching him embody the role -- but still, his presence couldn't overshadow or engender forgiveness for the film's myriad sins. Expect no sensuality in this tale of whores and the men who exploit them. With lots of heavy profanity for a faith-centered film -- I had no problem with that. I took greater issue with its weakly-written spiritual politics: made no sense, had no point, and in turn missed the mark. Looks very, very low budget within its underutilized NYC setting, but really it's just low skills. Do yourself a favor and skip this one -- it really isn't worth it, nor is its message (of losing then rediscovering faith) conveyed effectively enough to redeem it. Not edgy enough for urban-themed film lovers; too profanity-filled (f-words, etc.) for religious film fans -- and, overall, a disappointment for everybody! Many unintentionally funny moments, though.",1278460800,,1843,5.2087542087542085
8132862,5,B000GIXEX6,"Maya's Soul DVD is ""life changing"". As a Counseling professional, I work with many family dynamics. I believe that the writer of Maya's Soul, truly captured the reality of young lady experiences, that are facing very real challenges in our world today. I see this DVD as a ""life skill"" training tool, that I am able to use to educate my client families and others that I connect with- whether on a professional or personal level. This DVD offers very realistic solutions for overcoming life ills. All viewers can benefit from it.",1213315200,2,529,4.760869565217392
8132863,1,B000GIXEX6,"When I read the description of the movie, I was eager to view it.  The description depicted this movie as christian based but it is far from it.  I know the concept of trying to make the movies more relevant to todays society, but the language used drastically took away from the movie.  Also, since Maya, the main character is suppose to learn about God's grace through the decisions and trials that she endured, I did not see the relevance of praying to her mother.  I was truly upset concerning this purchase and view it as a waste of money if you are looking for a good, clean, and informative Christian movie.",1206316800,3,614,4.455357142857143
8132864,5,B000GIXEX6,"This movie is very good picture to watch, it has a lot of lessons in it for those that are going through something.  The acting was good and the story line was wonderful. I really enjoyed watching this movie.",1196985600,,208,4.333333333333333
