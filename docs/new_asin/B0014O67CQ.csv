She plays a wide eyed young girl who has been sent to a convent  by her stepmother when she was seven years old .Due to a cholera threat she is sent home . She is exposed to the real world with all it's beauty and wonders . She meets a young man and falls in love . She is afraid and confused but must choose the path her life will follow . Her mind and heart are torn apart . Not too predictable , a fine cast , well directed , and a fantastic performance by Bettis . I am very pleased to have this dvd in my movie collection .The copy I have is in English 2.0 with Italian subtitles.",1435881600,,670,3.7183098591549295
