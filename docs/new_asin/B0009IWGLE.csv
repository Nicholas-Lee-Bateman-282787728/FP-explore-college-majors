8061508,1,B0009IWGLE,"Have not opened the DVD as yet.  No doubt some of the old war Classics are worth watching.  How ever, when punching up the ""Imitation General"" it came up Amazon had the movie. Amazon didn't have the Classic movie.  I purchased the movie without reading all the films on the DVD.  Ted Turner has the rights of the I.G. and it is not for sale at this time as stated on Turner's Classic's. I gave a review the day I received the War Classic.  I believe some one was trying to make Amazon look bad. I will stay with AMAZON.  They have a good record.  Art Gray",1385251200,,555,4.130841121495327
8061509,1,B0009IWGLE,"I put in ""Imitation General DVD"" and Amazon brought up a page of multi-film DVDs about war, some starring Glenn Ford. Foolish, I assumed Amazon wouldn't have brought up these DVDs unless they had the Imitation General film I wanted. WRONG! Without going through every single one (as, of course, I did post-receipt of the DVD)I ordered one showing Glenn Ford starring. The cost of the film isn't worth the hassle of sending it back, but Amazon should change their practice of bringing up some worthless piece of _____ when you order one specific film which wasn't on any of the ones they brought up.",1375315200,12,598,4.704761904761905
8061510,4,B0009IWGLE,I liked it very much and would recommend it to war movie fans. It has a lot of different war movies.,1360368000,,100,3.8095238095238093
8061511,1,B0009IWGLE,"I was looking for Glenn Ford in ""Imitation General"" .  Glenn is in one of the movies on these dvds but its not what I was lookkng for.  You would not buy most of these movies.  They are BAD!",1358726400,12,190,3.8205128205128207
8061512,1,B0009IWGLE,Don't bother to buy this collection unless you are desperate to have some of the films under any circumstances. The audio/video quality looks as if it were transferred from scratchy 16mm prints. Even at the low price it is not a good buy.,1261008000,14,238,4.558139534883721
8061513,4,B0009IWGLE,I RECEVED YOUR DVD AND LIKE IT AND ENJOY THIS DVD AND ALSO DVD PACK AND QUALITY IS GOOD,1205280000,2,87,3.6315789473684212
8061514,3,B0009IWGLE,"this was a fair dvd but the main movie i was looking for was ""COMMANDO"" starring stuart granger in ref to the algerian war of indepandance ,made in 1962, rel 1964 in the USA if you have or know where please info me thank you.",1190937600,,225,4.022222222222222
8061515,4,B0009IWGLE,"There are over 23 hours worth of film and 16 feature films (4 dvd's) in this pack. Here is a list of the movies: Casablanca Express (1989), Cold War Killers (1986), A Yank in Libya (1942), Waterfront (1944), Commandos (1968), Eagles Attack at Dawn (1970), Hitler's SS (1985 - the best movie in the pack in my opinion), Go For Broke (1951), North Star (1943), Submarine Base (1943), Gung Ho! (1943), The Sell Out (1976), Black Brigade (1970), Half-Shot At Sunrise (1930), They Raid by Night (1942), Five For Hell (1968).
  Not all of the movies are worth seeing - the worst of the bunch are Casablanca Express & Five For Hell. The best at Hitler's SS and Gung Ho!. Several of the period WWII film's are very interesting just to see what Hollywood was putting out during the war years.",1184803200,24,783,4.546099290780142
