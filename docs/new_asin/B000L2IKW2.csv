8271549,4,B000L2IKW2,"Make no mistake, these workouts are tough at times. However they are more suitable for 40 plus excercisers,with low impact muscle- building moves. All are about 40-45 minutes in length and highly recommended. I much prefer these over the more recent Firm workouts,which are highly commercialized with a bunch of ""Stepford babes"".",1334966400,,329,5.346153846153846
