8134438,5,B000GTLMVQ,Great 1st lesson....makes you feel like you can do it. Lessons are as easy as can be and yet gets you right into the action of playing with other instruments right away.  If your just starting out this is the best beginner DVD out there.  If your going to play rock or metal bass don't hesitate in getting this.  Fun DVD to play and learn from and who could ask for a better bass teacher then David Ellefson! Buy it!,1364428800,,416,4.175
8134439,5,B000GTLMVQ,"I personally am a lead guitar player, but obtained this video for a friend who's learning bass and he said that out of all the instructional videos out there, this one's the best.  Dave Ellefson, whom I've admired as a metal bass player for many years, does an excellent job of explaining everything so that a beginner can understand it.  It's so much more than just, ""now hear's a scale, practice, the end"" like so many other videos of this sort are.  I recommend this to anyone interested in learning to be a metal bass player.  I have not yet viewed volume 2, but if it's anything like this one, then I recommend it as well.",1298419200,,627,4.379310344827586
8134440,5,B000GTLMVQ,"I'm not a guitar or bass player nor do I have the skill, patience, desire, or ability to play any musical instrument.  This is a review by a parent who observed results from their kid watching/using this DVD.

We bought this DVD for my step-son.  He's 13 and has been playing the regular guitar off and on for the last year or so.  He's had a couple of formal lessons.  For Christmas he got a bass guitar.  After 2 weeks of listening to a beginners version of ""Cat Scratch Fever"" 30-40x a day, we ordered this DVD.  Within a week he had completed the DVD and was tired of it. After the week of watching it, he was playing some new songs (the word playing is used loosely here) and was able to play the chords he picked up from the DVD.  He also started learning tab which he claims to have picked up from this DVD.  He's actually able to listen to a song, pick out the bass lines and play a version of it. It's pretty amazing to me how much he's improved in two weeks.

I'd highly recommend this DVD to any parent who has a kid learning to play the bass. I'm sure it'll provide value to anyone who is interested in learning to play the bass.  We've now ordered the Metal Bass 2 DVD - hopefully it'll provide more improvements.",1201046400,6,1226,4.174468085106383
