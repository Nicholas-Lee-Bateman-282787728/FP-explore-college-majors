1033729,5,6305347085,I saw the video and I was actually at the event live.  The best match was the cage match between Stone Cold and Vince McMahon where Vince took a huge fall onto the commentator's table. I have been to many wcw shows but did not  have near as much fun as I did at this one wwf show.,927331200,,280,3.810344827586207
1033730,5,6305347085,I think that this movie was a big hit for the WWF. The first match could of been better (Golddust vs Bluedust) but the main event was the best. Especially when Austin trew Mr. McMahon of the cage in to the announce  table. A must see. Buy it!!!,924998400,,244,4.083333333333333
1033731,5,6305347085,A great pay per view. Especialy for an in your house. Considering Rock Bottem wasn't that great. St. Valentine's Day Massacre was great. It was exciting and had a lot of surprises. The hardcore match was great too. I am  a big fan of the hard core matches. Especialy this one.,920246400,,276,4.411764705882353

1033823,3,6305347085,"On Feb. 14th, 1999, the WWF put on one heck of a wrestling show in Memphis, TN. And this PPV was indeed a pretty good classic, but not great by any means. The Last Man Standing match between The Rock & Mankind wasn't nearly as brutal as their 'I Quit' match at the Royal Rumble, but it's still kind of cool though. The Rock drops a set of the steel ring steps ontop of Mankind from the wrestling ring. The Rock is hilarious when he grabs the mic and sings ""Smackdown Hotel"" to the Memphis fans. But at the end, both The Rock & Mankind hit eachother simutaniously w/ steel chairs. As a result, both men are (supposedly) unable to answer the referee's ten count. The referee calls for the bell and rules this bout a darn draw. Boooooooo! Both men are then carted out on a stretcher and taken to a hospital in an ambulance for medical attention.
 The steel cage match between Stone Cold Steve Austin & Mr. McMahon is cool! Mr. McMahon gets his corporate butt kicked by the ""Texas Rattlesnake"", eventually taking a big fall from the top of the cage through the Spanish announce table! Oh, my gosh!!! This match is far from over, but hey, why not see it for yourself. You just might get a kick out of it! Cool match!
Al Snow takes on ""Hardcore"" Bob Holly for the WWF Hardcore Championship. The two men beat the living daylights out of eachother, eventually fighting into the Mississippi River (no joke, fans)! Cool matchup.
So there you have it. The three matches I have just mentioned are about the only matches worth seeing in the entire PPV. But this PPV still rocks! Good, but not great.",1032912000,,1586,4.412969283276451
1033824,1,6305347085,"This is the worst pay per view I have ever seen.  The Rock and Mankind spent most thier match laying on their backs, and whats the point of a steel cage match if hardly any of the match is spent in the cage, and one of the people in the match is the lousy owner of the company.  I could have gone to a bar on the right night and seen better action.  I thought the Hardcore title match was the best match just because it happened in the Mississippi River, which made for an interesting situation.  I couldn't wait for this to get over.  I just may sell my copy soon.",1030752000,,565,4.008928571428571
1033825,5,6305347085,"This PPV had 9 matches which were pretty entertaining execpt for the Bluedust Vs Golddust which was pretty bad.
The Hardcore match with Hardcore Holly and Al Snow was amazing. It had many rough hits and lead all the way into the river.
The Last Man Standing Match was excellent. Mankind got pretty beat up especcially at one time he gets back body droped off the announce table and hits the back of his head on it. good match but the ending [was bad], it should not have been a draw.
The Cage Match was actully good, Vince took a crazy bump off the cage and threw the spanish announce table which did not break properly and caused him to break his tail bone, Vince continued after about 10 minutes and kept up in the action pretty good for the injury he had. There was an amazing surprise ending which I won't tell but you will love it.",989539200,,836,4.2974683544303796
1033826,4,6305347085,"This Feb. 1999 PPV was certainly not the best the WWF put out that year but it certainly was not worthless either.  Mankind & The Rock battled in a ""Last Man Standing"" Match for the WWF title, an incredible brawl too, and Vince McMahon vs. Steve Austin in a steel cage was better than expected.  This match features McMahon taking a brutal fall from the cage (especially for a 54 year old man!)  Recomended, but some parts might be boring to some people, i.e. Big Bossman vs. Mideon.",974678400,,483,4.465909090909091
1033827,5,6305347085,"Last months Royal Rumble was typical of WWF Rumbles, everything on the card is great except the Rumble match itself. But this pay-per-view more  than makes up for any bad feelings you have toward the WWF, with The Rock  and Mankind going at it again in another brutal contest that is a classic.  No matter how many times they feud it still makes for must-see match-ups.  The main event though as got to be Austin and McMahon in a steel cage  match, where Vinnie Mc takes more bumps then Mankind, a brilliant event  where you knew Vince would have something up his sleeve. Even though he has  promised no interference from any Coporate members, no Rock, no Bossman, no  Kane, no Chyna, Vince McMahon will always manage to screw Austin.

Val Venis vs.  Ken Shamrock, Triple H/X-Pac vs. Chyna/Kane and the hardcore tilt with Snow  and Holly were all good bouts. The tag title match was decent but I could  have done without the Goldust-Bluedust match. The Bossman vs. Midion did  nothing for me as well.

2.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Al Snow vs Bob Holly

After being found attacked in the locker room on the previous Raw, Road Dogg was forced to relinquish the Hardcore Championship and JOB Squad members, Bob Holly and Al Snow would battle it out against each other to etermine who would win the vacant Hardcore Championship. A really enjoyable Hardcore match here. While it didn't have exactly everything you'd want out of a Hardcore match, it was enough to suffice. Holly and Snow fight to the backstage area, beating the heck out of each other with anything they can find. The fight eventually spills out into the streets and they end up fighting down to the banks of the Mississippi River that was sitting right across from the arena. Holly ends up hitting Snow in the back of the head with a large stick and pins him to get a close 2 count. A bit more fighting goes on and Holly ends up wrapping Snow in a chain link fence to ensure he can't escape and pins him for the win. Fairly good Hardcore match but has a comical ending to it.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) The Big Boss Man vs Mideon

This was a surprisingly decent match and I say surprisingly because Mideon wasn't exactly known for having any average matches with people back then. Mideon, representing the Ministry of Darkness and Boss Man representing The Corporation; this was a battle of the factions as part of the on-going feud between the Ministry and the Corporation that happened in early 1999. Mideon runs into a Boss Man Slam and that's all it takes for Boss Man to get the win. After the mach, the Ministry comes to the ring and jumps the Boss Man while The Undertaker and Paul Bearer watch on from the walkway. After his mugging, the Boss Man is taken to the back by the Ministry

Kevin Kelly conducts an interview with D'Lo Brown, Mark Henry, and Ivory about their upcoming match with Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett. D'Lo warns Debra that if she gets involved in the match, Ivory will rip every stitch of clothing off her body
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry w/Ivory vs Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett (c) w/Debra

A rather fairly good Tag Team match and an interesting one as well as both teams were heels, but D'Lo and Henry were more of the tweeners in the match. Some nice back and forth competition is exchanged between the 2, while Lawler and Cole constantly hype and remind everyone about how Ivory promised to rip Debra's clothes off if she interfered in the match. As the end draws, D'Lo goes to the top turnbuckle for the Lo Down on Owen but Debra expectingly distracts him. Ivory goes over and starts mouthing off at Debra and D'Lo and the referee try to separate the two. Meanwhile Owen takes advantage of the distraction and hits Henry in the legs with Jarrett's guitar. Jarrett picks up the scraps and locks on the Figure 4 Leg Lock and Mark taps almost immediately. Following the match, Ivory keeps true to word and rips or at least attempts to rip Debra's clothes off but she escapes with Owen and Jarrett before it happens
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Val Venis w/Ryan Shamrock vs Ken Shamrock (c) (Special Referee: Billy Gunn)

This feud all started when Val Venis had Shamrock's sister Ryan, in his latest ""flick"", slipping her his Canadian bacon. Too much? Sorry. Soon after the 2 began a relationship with each other which enraged Shamrock and lead to him attacking Venis and going on a rampage, leading to this match. To add on to the feud; Billy Gunn who was in trouble with Ken just a month before for a similar act with his sister, was assigned the role of being referee after WWF referees refuse to officiate the match due to Shamrock attacking several of the referees in the weeks leading up to the PPV. The match starts immediately as Shamrock storms to the ring and goes after Venis with some fast paced action but it starts to slow down a bit midway. Billy Gunn adds some slight humor to the match, screwing with both Val and Shamrock on several occasions by making slow counts. Shamrock ends up getting Val in the Ankle Lock and Ryan manages to pull Venis to the ropes to prevent him from tapping. Ken goes to the outside and berates Ryan telling her blood is thicker than water. Ryan smacks her brother in the face and Billy gets out to call Shamrock back in the ring but Shamrock shoves him. Gunn responds by attacking Shamrock and throwing him back in the ring where Shamrock walks into a small package pin from Venis for the win. An enraged Ken Shamrock goes after Gunn after the match and attacks him but Billy returns to the ring momentarily after and attacks Venis. Great match that had a nice storyline continuing to develop

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Triple H and X-Pac vs Kane and Chyna

This match was set up after Chyna turned on DX and defected to The Corporation. Things become personal between Chyna and her former pals, Triple H and X-Pac, declaring that she was the one who made DX what it was. With that being declared, a tag team match was made to settle their issues.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Championship Last Man Standing Match: The Rock vs Mankind (c)

In this forgotten and classic follow up to their Royal Rumble and Half Time Heat encounters, The Rock and Mankind battled once more in the ring for the coveted WWF Championship--this time in a Last Man Standing match. Rocky and Foley waste no time getting into it as the early stages of the match start off in the crowd but it finds its way back to the ring. How fitting that the name of this PPV was St. Valentine's Day Massacre because that's exactly what this match was; a massacre. Lots of high spots and chair shots as well as The Rock in classic fashion delivering some golden mic work in this match. A double steel chair collision shot spells the end as neither man is either to get up before the 10 count, making the match outcome a draw. Both future tag team partners are loaded on to stretchers and carried out of the arena in ambulances. A very fast paced and action filled match with an anti-climatic ending to set up their final match against each other the next night on Raw. Most people only remember the Mankind/Rock feud for their epic Royal Rumble encounter and the Half Time Heat match, while their Last Man Standing Match at this PPV goes highly unnoticed 99% of the time.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Steel Cage Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Vince McMahon

This was probably the match that most, if not all fans were looking forward to out of all the matches on the card. After screwing Stone Cold out of a Royal Rumble victory, Vince McMahon was goaded into putting the #1 Contendership spot on the line against Austin inside of a Steel Cage. The winner of the match would get the right to fight the WWF Champion at Wrestlemania 15. An over-confident McMahon would ban all Corporation members from interfering in the match and would fire them in any member got involved. This was probably the highest point of the Austin/McMahon feud as Austin would finally get Vince in the ring, one-on-one, with no strings attached. The match begins with some early shenanigans with Vince stalling about getting in the cage. Austin soon tricks Vince and gets his hands on him and the beating begins with Vince taking a bump off the cage and a sick crash through the table. Once Austin gets McMahon in the ring, that's where the real fun begins as Austin tears Vince apart, busts him open, and refuses to exit the cage, despite having an easy win in the bag. It all leads to the debut of the Big Show, who comes through the ring and attacks Austin. Show accidentally gives Austin the win, tossing him into the cage, causing the cage wall to bust open, allowing Austin to drop to the floor and win, much to the surprise of Vince McMahon.

Overall: The first and only St. Valentine's Day Massacre and second to last In Your House PPV was extremely well put together. Look past the dull opening match between Goldust and Bluedust and maybe the match between Boss Man and Mideon and this was an enjoyable PPV. It's only remembered for the Steel Cage match, making it an very underrated PPV from the Attitude Era.",1423872000,,9234,5.114797611147976
7889843,4,6305347085,"Thanks to another old tape that I found in my large wrestling collection, I was able to rewatch another WWF PPV from the year 1999 in the first (only so far) ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" event. Now during this time, the main stories leading into this event surrounded events that happened at the Royal Rumble. Mankind & The Rock had been battling for months with matches such as an I-Quit match & an Empty Arena match with each match providing unique finishes which lead to this encounter being a Last Man Standing match to settle the score. Speaking of scores, Stone Cold Steve Austin had some bitter scores to settle with Vince McMahon. After McMahon won the Rumble (believe it or not) & forfeited his title shot, Austin was named the replacement by Commissioner Shawn Michaels but Austin wanted McMahon to the point where he challenged McMahon to a steel cage match & on top of that, place his shot for WWF Championship at WrestleMania on the line.

Goldust vs Blue Meanie. This was just a short match that was supposed to be nothing more than a comedic match. This is one of those matches that your either gonna like or hate depending on your taste but the crowd enjoyed it so it did it's job in getting the crowd fired up.

Hardcore Championship: Al Snow vs Bob Holly. This was scheduled to be Road Dogg vs Al Snow for the title but due to the Road Dogg's injury the previous night on RAW, Snow didn't have an opponent so fellow J.O.B. Squad member Bob Holly stepped up for the challenge. This was the match that credited Holly from going to J.O.B. squad member to Hardcore Holly as these two just brawled through the crowd, backstage, parking lot & even the Mississippi River with The King delivering some hilarious commentary there along with a unique finish that I don't think was prior to this. An entertaining match that again made the Hardcore Holly character.

Big Bossman vs Mideon. Just a boring & pointless filler with the best part being at the aftermath where The Undertaker showed up with his Ministry to deliver a vicious beating to the Bossman before kidnapping as well.

WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett vs D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry. The story here was that Mark Henry was smitting with Debro so D'Lo had brought in Ivory to be the equalizer for Henry along with Ivory promising that if Debra got involved in this match, then she would rip off her clothes. Owen & Jarrett were underrated tag team as they used the tag team strategy of cutting off the ring & keeping D'Lo in their corner before Henry came in to be the powerhouse of the match. Debra did get involved which lead to Owen & Jarrett focusing on Henry's knee along with a guitar to get the victory.

Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock vs Val Venis w/Special Referee Billy Gunn. The storyline here was that Val Venis was messing around with Shamrock's sister Ryan & it was driving Shamrock nuts to the point where Billy Gunn made himself the special guest referee since no referee wanted to get involved in this match. Ryan was a major focus in this match with the camera showing her a few times but the most entertaining parts was Billy Gunn being the bias referee with slow counts, getting in both men's faces, not watching the action at times & even appearing confused when someone was using a submission to the point to where Ken & Val had to remind him to ask the guy if he gives. Ken & Val put on a nice match that went back & forth but this was more about continuing the storyline surrounding Ryan Shamrock to the point where she slapped Ken (which if you listen clearly, he tells her to do) & Gunn showing where he stands in this feud.

Triple H & X-Pac vs Kane & Chyna. The night after the Royal Rumble, Chyna turned on Triple H to join the Corporation after Triple H had quit in his title match against The Rock in order to protect her from being attacked by Kane. It should be noted that Shane McMahon made his way to the ring before the match got started to join the commentary table. Chyna was still limited at this point in time so her time in the match was limited but even with that being said, this match played out better than anyone expected as everyone else did a great job making Chyna look better whenever she was in there but the real highlight was the interaction between X-Pac & Shane McMahon that played a factor not only in the match but setting up one of the main events for WrestleMania.

Last Man Standing Match: WWF Champion Mankind vs The Rock. Mankind came into this match with an injured knee due to the attack earlier on HEAT at the hands of The Rock & you could see him favoring it while making his way to the ring. Even though their Rumble match was a more violent encounter, this match certainly delivered when it came to actual quality in delivering another match that was different than their previous encounters. They started brawling in the early stages with Mankind putting his hands behind his back similar to the Rumble match. This went to the outside where they would start using weapons such as a TV monitor, table near the entrance way where Mankind DDT'd Rock through a table, the ringbell, & the constant use of steel chairs & steel steps including a sick moment where Rock through the steps from the inside of the ring onto Mankind who was laying on the outside floor. Along with that action, there was some great & entertaining comedy such as Mankind trying to do the Corporate Elbow (or Mr. Elbow as Cole called it) along with The Rock singing ""SmackDown Hotel"". The ending was sort of cheap but it didn't take away from the effort of both men.

Steel Cage Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Vince McMahon. Austin's title shot at WrestleMania was on the line along with McMahon promising that there would be no outside interference from the Corporation or they will be fired. On top of that, Austin had made a few promises of his own which was to bust McMahon open, beat him from every side of the cage & walk over his carcass to win. This match summarized all of that as Austin just unleashed ""A Can Of Whoop Ass"" on Vince from the start to where he faked an injury just to get his hands on Vince. From there, Austin knocked him off the top of the cage through the announce table with Austin actually throwing Vince off the stretcher & using it as well, before beating him down once they got in the ring with some comedic moments of Vince flipping the bird whenever Austin thought about exiting the cage. The ending was shocking as Paul Wight (WCW's Giant & currently The Big Show) made his WWF debut & made an impact in the match but not the way McMahon expected.

Overall, I enjoyed this event more than I did the Royal Rumble card as there was more to enjoy on this card with the only real flops being the Bossman/Mideon match & the opening match (again depending on your taste of comedy). However the main events & the Hardcore title match made this event standout that I would receive this event as one of the better cards from the WWF in 1999.",1210550400,,7002,4.459797033567526

(Note-Each VHS I review has a ""Match of the VHS"" award somewhere in it.)

WWF St. Valentines Day Massacre
This PPV is one that can be over looked really easy. Most people only remember it for it's last two matches, but it carried some great mid-card action as well. It had its slow points, but it was overall a very strong show. Also, if I remember correctly, this was WWF's last IYH PPV. If I am wrong on that, please leave a comment and correct me.

Goldust VS Bluedust
The Blue Meanie from ECW has been taunted Goldust for weeks now. He has even went as far as dressing like a blue version of Goldust. This was an entertaining opener. The match was kept short and filled with comedic action.
RATING- 6/10

WWF Hardcore Championship
Al Snow VS Bob Holly
This was for the Vacated Hardcore Title. This is the match that went all the way to the Mississippi River. This was one of the better early Hardcore Title matches. It included all your usual hardcore antics; there are many weapons used and lots of backstage brawling. The match ends in a fairly innovative way.
RATING- 8.5/10

Big Boss Man VS Mideon
This match was boring with little interesting action. The best part is when it ends. I'm not just saying that as a joke at how bad the match is either, the aftermath is awesome and included a wicked beat down of Boss Man.
RATING- 3.5/10

WWF World Tag Team Championships
Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart (c) w/Debra VS D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry w/Ivory
A solid tag featuring some heated confrontations between Debra and Ivory. The story is that Mark Henry still liked Debra, and became easily distracted by her. Ivory was meant to be the equalizer. All wrestlers do well in this match.
RATING- 8/10

After this match, Mankind gives an interview about The Rock's attack on him earlier.

Special Referee- Billy Gunn
WWF Intercontinental Championship
Ken Shamrock(c) VS Val Venis w/Ryan Shamrock
Val Venis is with Ken Shamrock's sister. Shamrock doesn't appreciate this and is losing his mind. Billy Gunn provides some of the most entertaining refereeing ever. This includes slow counts, no counts, not knowing what moves are pins. Shamrock and Venis put on a strong match.
RATING- 8/10

Triple H & X-Pac VS Chyna & Kane
Chyna turns on D-X and joins the Corporation. This is really just your average tag match. What makes it so entertaining is Chyna beating up on guys and Shane McMahon is on commentary. Shane McMahon makes his presence felt by attacking X-Pac. I liked the ending as it made no one look weak.

Vince McMahon VS Stone Cold Steve Austin
This match starts off with some brawling outside the cage because McMahon refuses to get in the cage with Austin. They go up in the crowd and brawl. McMahon tries to escape Austin by climbing into the cage. McMahon pays for it as he is caught and falls through the announce table. Eventually, Austin gets McMahon in the cage and the match finally starts. The match is entirely a beat-down of McMahon, but it's one of the most entertaining beat-downs there has ever been. Paul Wight, better know as Big Show, would make his debut near the end of this match.

7889846,2,6305347085,"This PPV was horrible, the last man standing match was boring and dragged on, the cage match was good, and the only reason why this PPV even gets 2 stars is because during the Shamrock/Val Venis match Shamrock's sister goes face to face with Shamrock and she hit him, just before the slap if you listen closely you can hear Shamrock say ""Slap Me"" in his normal voice reminding her what to do at that moment, that was funny.",1093910400,,423,4.367088607594937
7889847,4,6305347085,"The ppv may not have been excellent, but it was a show that holds dearly to my heart.  Two of the best feud's in 1999 emerged in this show. Those two were Mankind/Rock and Austin/McMahon.  Foley and The Rock battled in a Last Man Standing match which was brutal and very entertaining.  The Rock sung a song and did commentary. Foley tried to do the people's elbow.  The match may not have been as brutal as the Royal RUmble I quit match, but it was an a great match. Austin/McMahon settled their differences in a steel cage.  If Austin lost he had to give up his wrestlemania title match that he was awarded. As you would expect Austin destroyed McMahon, but how it happened was cool.  McMahon suffered a beating before the match even begin when he fell out of the top of the cage into the spanish announcer's table. Austin had several chances to win the match but Vince lured him back in by flipping him the bird.  Finally, the big show pop up from the bottom of the ring and threw Austin into the cage multiple times.  He threw Austin unto the cage one last time and this time the cage gave way and Austin ended up escaping the cage and won.  Other decent matches on the card was the intergender match b/w HHH and x-pac vs Chyna and Kane.  The hardcore title was on the line b/w Al snow and Hardcore Holly which had a cool ending.  The other matches were mostly duds such as Goldust vs Blue Meanie and Ken Shamrock vs Val venis.  Overall a great show and the 2nd best ppv of 1999 behind Fully Loaded.",1064620800,,1502,4.287234042553192

WWF Title, Last Man Standing Match: Mankind v The Rock
Much like their 'I Quit' Match at the Royal Rumble, these two superstars took brutality to a whole new level. The match ended when both men knocked each other out with steel chairs at the same time, forcing a double countout. Therefore, the match became a draw. ****1/2. Match would have been ***** if it had a proper ending and a real winner, and not the stupid draw.
Steel Cage Match: Vince McMahon v Steve Austin
After Austin totally beat the hell out of Vince inside the cage, Big Show came up from under the ring and attacked the Rattlesnake near the end of the match. He threw Austin into the cage, forcing the cage to brake, and Stone Cold managed to escape for the win! ****
