8692308,3,B00QQRBKPA,"I love the other dvds that I have from this trainer.  I have the 2 upper body workouts from this same series and I like those better than this one.  This one has a lot of dynamic type movements which I don't care for due to knee issues and lots of RA issues.  It's more difficult to control movement when I am jumping around, etc, so I prefer straight up weight lifting where I can slowly control each movement.  However, if you are looking for a mix of weighted movements and dynamic/power moves (lots of jumping) then this is a good workout for you.",1529280000,,551,4.269230769230769

8692312,5,B00QQRBKPA,"I love most of Cathe's workouts, and this is no exception.  I don't particularly like to work out, but I love the effects it has on how I look and feel, so I do it regularly.  These days, I mostly only do these metabolic type workouts that combine compound lower and upper body moves with weights with cardio bursts.  It's the most efficient way to work out, and less time spent is a good thing.  I have all the Lift it Hiit It workouts, and I do the shorter timesaver premixes instead of the entire work out because, well, it's shorter.  It's definitely enough to get me breathless and sweating, and doing them 5 days a week, they keep me in great shape.  Thanks Cathe!",1443571200,8,670,4.32
8692313,5,B00QQRBKPA,This will definitely give you a great legs workout. I love this workout. I will add this DVDs to a once a week routine.,1432512000,,119,4.0
8692314,5,B00QQRBKPA,"This DVD is part of Cathe's ""Ripped with Hiit"" series, a series that combines strength training with cardio. This workout alternates leg exercises with explosive cardio moves so you work your legs and your heart.

Time: 41 minutes
Equipment needed: weight lifting gloves and several sets of medium to heavy dumbbells. Cathe uses: 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 35 and 40 pound dumbbells.
Outfits: Pretty navy blue tops and black bottoms.
Crew: Amanda, Brenda, Jai and Al.

Why I love this workout:

* The time flies by! There is no downtime since you're moving quickly from a leg exercise to an explosive cardio exercise. Thank goodness about 25 minutes into the workout, the rest times get a little longer because you really need it!

* Cathe tells us what weight she is using. At first, my ego told me to keep up with her, but I was quickly dropping the weights so that I could maintain good form.

* The exercises are fun. Yes, only a true fitness fanatic can call tough exercise fun, but what can I say? Sure there are lunges and dead lifts and plyo jacks, but you're moving quickly from one exercise to the next so if you don't like a move, wait a minute and you're on to the next move. My favorite exercise is the cross over lunge.

* The versatility of all the premixes and bonus workouts. There are several premixes of varying lengths from 21 minutes to 63 minutes. There are two bonus ab workouts as well.

A few things to note about this workout:

* Cathe uses a wide variety of weights. If you have a limited set of weights, you may not be able to follow her exactly. I had been doing workouts by other instructors that only use a few different weights so this constant changing of weights takes some getting used to.

* The weight exercises move somewhat quickly and it is hard to keep good form with heavier weights. For example, you do a shuffle side lunge with 12 pound weights. I was really afraid that I would tweak my back with this. Two key things to remember are: always maintain good form, even if it means using lower weights and listen to your body.

I recommend this workout to those wanting an effective and efficient workout that works both your legs and your heart.",1426809600,10,2181,4.457286432160804
8692315,5,B00QQRBKPA,"Another hit by Cathe! I loved it, it really made my muscles burn and my heart rate was up the entire time. During the workout you alternate from weight lifting- targeting specific leg muscles to cardio moves that target those same muscles. another very effective workout from Cathe!",1420156800,4,282,4.895833333333333
