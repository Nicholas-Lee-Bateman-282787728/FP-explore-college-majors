8502126,5,B006ORLD7M,"What initially concerns with a an apparent getaway of a sixteen years old girl, is just the begining of a plot with multiple branchs. The unsaid details of a recent past will begin to shadow the present until the boiling point be reached.

Once more, a smart and well constructed polt comes us from Norway. But what I really like most is the way about the further implications become an intriguing of power, seduction, blackmail, greedy and ambition.

Go for this singular thriller and watch it carefully. It will let not dissapointed at all. Superb performnces of all cast and formidable direction.

Not to be missed.",1333670400,,618,4.811320754716981
