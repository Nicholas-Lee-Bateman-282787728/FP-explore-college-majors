972711,5,630514415X,"I love this movie. Definately one of my all-time favorites. If it isn't then the only thing that comes close is Glory. Also with Denzel Washington.  I love the way the story is told about an upcoming basketball star who  gets caught up in lots of trouble. It is an all-star movie. Check it out!  And if you don't have a stomach for graphic sex, violence, drug abuse, and  harsh language, please check out Glory. It is an excellent movie about a  black regiment in the Civil War. Possibly my favorite movie.",918950400,,506,4.456521739130435

I saw this movie about 17 years ago and was so disappointed, I never wanted to see it again. There is not a single thing to like about this movie, it made me cringe.

973037,5,630514415X,"Denzel Washington and writer-director Spike Lee team for the third time with this contemporary basketball drama focusing on a promising athlete, the son of a convict-father entitled,He Got Game. It is sports-drama film written and directed Lee. It stars Washington as Jake Shuttlesworth, a prison inmate convicted for killing his wife. The father of the top- ranked basketball prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth,played by NBA star Ray Allen, Jake is released on parole for a week by the state's governor in order to persuade his son to play for the governor's alma mater in exchange for a heavily-reduced prison sentence.

Jake Shuttlesworth has been in prison for six years when tough prison- warden Wyatt tells him that he's getting a temporary parole with the promise of a commuted sentence. However, there's a trade-off -- Jake must talk his son, Jesus Shuttlesworth, the top-ranked high-school basketball player in the country, into signing with the governor's alma mater, Big State. A flashback makes it clear that Jesus' mother was accidentally killed by Jake during a violent family fight. After Jake went to prison, the resentful Jesus was left alone to raise his sister Mary. Now several colleges are offering Jesus scholarships, and montages satirize the manner in which young athletes are wooed by educators and coaches across the country. However, Jake will soon be back behind bars if he can't get Jesus to sign with Big State within the week. Meanwhile, the greed of other family members begins to surface.

The movie presents a realistic view on how athletes particularly basketball players are recruited by universities in their rosters. Aside from that,it also presents a vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama that would touch the viewers. Lee provides an artsy color film feature that was aided by great music from Aaron Copeland and Public Enemy. The story is moving especially when it becomes personal on both Jake and Jesus' part. The performances of Denzel Washington and Ray Allen,in his film debut,are also worthy to be mentioned. Overall,it may not be a great film but it is still worth your time especially for people who loves basketball.",1419206400,,2178,5.1671388101983

973137,5,630514415X,I chose this rating because I have been in an abuse situation. It drove home to me that I could have suffered the same reality as the wife who was accidently killed. It was sad. Denzel did a great job showing the grief that the husband in the play felt. I was very touched by the scene in which he hugged his wife's tomb stone. He made that scene seem so real. I like the way he never gave up on those children his character really had something to surmount with his children.

973239,5,630514415X,"Normally in films, a father bonding with his son is a peaceful scene; tossing a baseball back and forth, fishing with each other, and talking about life. However in the 1998 film, He Got Game, father and son bonding is pushed to the extreme when Denzel Washington and youthful NBA player, Ray Allen take to the big screen to portray a different side of the clich relationship. Directed, written, and produced by the legendary Spike Lee, who I have always been a fan of and I can't name too many blemishes on Denzel Washington's filmography either. I first went into the film with great expectations and still was amazed by the content of the movie! The only spark of skepticism I had was the fact that Ray Allen had a lead role. Spike Lee didn't have to cast an NBA player for Jesus' character. Any young actor could have took the role but he gave it to someone who never acted before. Having a basketball player as the main character was a risk but Ray Allen came through and delivered a great performance.  Usually, athletes who try their hand at acting make their fans lose a bit of respect for them -- see Michael Jordan in Space Jam and Shaq in anything. He Got Game is a great film for many reasons but mainly because of the acting displays, intense plot, and the transformation of the main characters.
The movie follows number one high school basketball prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth (Allen) struggling with the decision on where he will continue his basketball career after graduating and the media that a decision like that attracts along with the strains placed on family and romantic ties. Meanwhile, in the Attica Correctional Facility, Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) is spending time in prison for murdering his wife; Jesus' mother. With everyone wanting to get Jesus to come to their respective college or professional team, the governor offers Jake Shuttlesworth less time on his sentencing if he can convince his son to play basketball for his alma mater. Jake is let go on house arrest and given a week to make this happen which really doesn't seem like enough time since his son hates the sight of him. Throughout the film, the time period switches from the present day where Jesus is making his decision to the past where he used to get physically challenged by his father on the basketball court before his mother's passing. This addition really lifts the movie and gives it more emotion.
What I really love is that the film really digs into the controversies of collegiate recruiting all while maintaining its main plot points and theme. During the recruiting process, lots of students are persuaded by cars, money, and other gifts and Spike Lee wasn't hesitant to bring light to those discrepancies throughout the movie. Jesus and his younger sister live in their own apartment where Jesus pays the rent but nothing is ever mentioned of him having a job. Also, in the beginning, Jesus' girlfriend tries to get him to meet a friend of her family who is an agent but Jesus aggressively declines and tells her ""you know that s*** is illegal."" Including this in the film was genius because it makes the movie more real by showing something ugly about basketball and not just the glamorous lifestyle and flashy dunks.
Being a basketball fan, my opinion of the film may be a little bias but I loved every minute of it. It's a rather long film, clocking in at 136 minutes but it goes by so fast, it will leave viewers wanting more! With great acting from Washington and Allen, a well-polished story line, and a vintage soundtrack, this movie is one of my favorites. I don't only suggest this movie for fans who would be able to point out former NBA players' cameos and classic `90's sneakers worn throughout the film. I think anyone who loves a great, dramatic movie with intense scenes and amazing acting would enjoy He Got Game.",1382659200,,3845,4.704747774480712

Now on to the movie the story is interesting but I do think denzel washington's character pushed his son too hard which caused the argument that lead to the death of jesus's mother. I can totally relate to this film because in the movie jesus tells his father that he hates his name and I hate my name too so I found out we both have that in common.

973624,4,630514415X,"In 2001 Denzel Washington finally won his `Leading Actor' Oscar despite the fact that three of the four remaining nominees put in better performances than he did (those three would be, in descending order, Wilkinson, Crowe and Smith).  I'm not saying that Washington's portrayal of Alonzo in `Training Day' was bad or even mediocre.  He was a pistol, really electrifying the screen with his commanding presence, and he scores major points for taking himself away from the `dead eye stare' I see him give all too often (watch `American Gangster') and really igniting his face.  That said, he still was not the best of the year.

I bring up this point, not because I want to raise my voice in disapproval, but because I want to draw a major comparison in character between Alonzo and Washington's character Jake Shuttlesworth in `He Got Game'.  Both characters have that swagger, that jive and that fire, yet Jake is a much deeper and more emotionally complicated character than Alonzo, and Washington plays to his strengths in such a fierce way that I am baffled he wasn't even considered in the running for this performance, yet was handed an Oscar for basically doing the same thing three years later to a less impressive extent.  Washington grabs your attention here, not only with his blunt abrasiveness but also with his human and tortured rawness.

`He Got Game' may on the outset look like just another teen sports story.  It centers around Jesus (pronounced like the son of God) Shuttlesworth, a brilliant athlete who is being harassed by every state in the area trying to rally him to their basketball team.  Jesus is not your typical teenager though.  He has been raising his young sister since their father killed their mother and was sent to prison.  Their father is Jake.  Now, Jake is presented with a strange and inviting opportunity; namely to convince his son to join Big State University and in return he'll receive a lighter sentence.  The problem is that since Jake has been locked up Jesus has refused to speak to him, and he has no plans of changing his mind on the matter.  Still, Jake decides that it is worth a try.

The underlying story within `He Got Game' is about the path leading to redemption and the sacrifices that we make to get there.  As Jake tries to reestablish some grounds with his son we can see that he needs this; more than freedom he needs the forgiveness that only his son can extend.  Spike Lee brilliantly continues his moral lessons by exposing the corruption and greed within the striving for fame, but Lee never strays away from the purity and admirableness of those who have a clear head and a strong will.

So, like I mentioned, Washington is Oscar worthy here, but the rest of the cast is more hit or miss for me.  Ray Allen comes off a little stiff in areas but for the most part he delivers a strong performance alongside Washington.  He has some pristine moments where you can see his internal struggle.  Rosario Dawson is breathtaking as Jesus' girlfriend Lala, but even more than breathtaking she is a wonderful actress here.  She really understands her character and exploits her weaknesses effortlessly.  Milla Jovavich is a little miscast here, and she seems to be `acting' too much, which sadly comes off amateurish in many scenes.  Zelda Harris is also a weaker link, but she was young and so I won't lay into her too hard.  She wasn't a central character and so her few flaws are not detrimental to the film.

`He Got Game' is not a masterpiece, I won't go that far, but it is an extremely well crafted vehicle for Lee and Washington to shine as brightly as they are able.  Lee has done better work (`25th Hour' for one) and Washington has done better work (`Malcolm X') but to say that these two men are at the top of their game here would be an understatement.",1218499200,,3825,4.644873699851412

The mother is dead, killed accidentally in a temper but the father. The father is in prison for a very long time. The son hates his father and has to learn how to get over his hatred. The daughter is missing her father but her brother is isolating her. The uncle and aunt only see the money the son represents. He is a high school star in basketball and he can get directly into making a lot of money if he joins the NBA or he can go to some university and have a scholarship. One more tricky element: the governor wants the kid for the team of his university, the one he sponsors and likes. So why not use the father, give him a week of semi freedom and force him thus to negotiate his son's signing the right papers. What's more the basketball star is invited by some schools to come and visit and there he is provided with everything he may desire, including the girls and the useless other entertainments. The NBA is offering a car to the uncle, though in fact it is for the son to run it. And the high school coach is able to put ten thousand dollars on the table for him to join, guess what, the NBA of course. Immoral. The film is saved from this muddy marshlandish country by the son choosing the only moral solution, the one that will help his father to get out faster, the one that is going to cure him from his hatred, even if that is slightly idealistic, frankly utopian.

Ray Allen isn't as proficient an actor as he is a shooting guard, yet his performance works here. Denzel Washington and a supporting cast of Lee film veterans deliver in their roles, making up for any inexperience Allen has. Washington is impressive as Allen's father, a convicted felon who is given a short work release to try to convince his star son to attend the governeor's alma mater.

Denzel is awesome as usual, but the story itself and the trials of the main characters were thought-provoking and interesting.

973702,5,630514415X,"Spike Lee is such a talented filmmaker, one wonders why he took such
a fine script, marvelous cinemotography, thematic complexity and consistently fine performances -- then perforated everything with gratuitous sex.

Certainly, professional scouts lure college athletes with excess, but the manner in which Lee drops sex into the action here limits the audience for an otherwise outstanding film and interrupts the emotional resonance its characters evoke.

The film recounts a convicted father's effort to free himself from  prison for accidently killing his wife. He does so by trying to persuade his son, a gifted basketball player,to attend the governor's university, ""Big State,"" because governor is a fan.

The film has layers of plot and meaning woven together seamlessly. There is a father's effort to redeem himself in his son's eyes , to do penance in memory of his beloved wife. In all, Lee recounts the process of forgiveness with compassion and accuracy.

Beneath these layers, Lee explores the Faustian drama of professional athletics in a corrupt society.  He exposes the manner in which business corporations and big education elevate athletic talent for their selfish ends, often asting aside decency and ethical sensibility.

The score, combining the music of Aaron Copland and Public Enemy, is oddly moving, without a trace of affectation.

Gratuitous sex aside -- this film confirms Spike Lee as one of our most moral filmmakers.  While his output is inconsistent, his great films are just that. They are permanent and well-crafted, ethically sound and constructive.

In his role as Jake, Denzel Washington turns out one of his greatest performances. Whether embroiled in violence or tenderness, there is a depth and vision to this actor that is rare and wonderful.

Recommended for mature audiences.",1133827200,13,1820,5.328671328671328
973703,3,630514415X,"I love Denzel Washington. I mean, I absolutely adore this man...he never gives a less than credible performance in any role he plays. Once again, he delivers as a less-than-perfect father in ""He Got Game"". This is more than a story about basketball - it's about human relationships, the bond between a father and son, and how that prevails even in the worst of circumstances.

The story, set in the Coney Island housing projects in Brooklyn, NY (where it was also filmed), surrounds Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel) who has been imprisoned in Attica for the accidental murder of his wife. His son, Jesus (Ray Allen), a high school basketball star who is being hotly pursued to either go into college or sign with the NBA, has nothing but contempt and disgust for his father. If Jake can convince his estranged son to attend a certain university and sign a letter of intent, then his time will be reduced significantly, since this school also happens to be the governor's alma mater.

It starts off with a lot of promise, when Jake is allowed out of prison for a week to try to talk to his son. But after a while, the plot starts to wear thin when Jake keeps approaching Jesus, and Jesus is always telling Jake to leave him alone. How long can this be stretched out before you get tired of the whole thing? Okay, you can throw in flashbacks of Jesus as a child and how his father pushed him hard to play ball; a scheming, opportunistic girlfriend (Rosario Dawson); money-hungry friends and relatives; and plenty of tempting offers to either take money, sign with the NBA, go to this college and so forth to thicken the plot. Everyone seems to want something from Jesus, and as a result he has very little trust for anyone around him, and understandably so. But even that tends to get monotonous because you keep hearing the same type of dialogue, only from different characters. But stay with it.

This movie does show realistic situations that face talented high-school prospects that can play basketball, so Spike was on point with this. However, it is not the first film that touched upon this subject. There was also ""Blue Chips"" that had Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee (Penny) Hardaway in it as students/basketball players being heavily recruited for colleges and how they were being paid off, depending on what their decision would be. (At the time this movie was out, both Shaq and Penny were members of the Orlando Magic.)

Ray Allen is an NBA basketball player in real life, but he is NO ACTOR, just like Shaq and Penny aren't actors, either. Whatever scenes Allen appeared in were kind of painful to watch because the man just has no skills in that area. He does try, though. And the rest of the cast aren't much better, most notably Milla Jovovich. She plays a grimy and pathetic prostitute who is repeatedly abused by her pimp. I found it difficult to believe that Denzel or any man would find her to be desirable. But then again, Denzel as Jake was just coming out of prison, so...

I also disliked the fact that Spike had to throw in so many sex scenes. I normally enjoy Spike's films, but why must he exploit women? He makes them look like they are nothing more than lowlife sexual playthings who are out to use men for what they have. ""He Got Game"" runs rampant with this, even casting porn star Heather Hunter in one of many (unnecessary) sex scenes! What the hell?! Although Spike does it on a smaller scale in his other movies, and always has, it didn't bother me as much as it did in this film. It was excessive. I understand the point that Spike was trying to make, but come on - couldn't he leave a little SOMETHING to the imagination?

""He Got Game"" is definitely worth watching. Not perfect, but not a waste of time, either. See it!",1127606400,18,3749,4.571428571428571
973704,4,630514415X,"After producing mediocre stuff like Crooklyn and Bamboozled in the mid-1990s, Spike Lee rebounded strongly in 1998 with He Got Game. This was easily Lee's best film since Malcolm X in 1992.

At first, moviegoers may be inclined to think that He Got Game will be little more than a slam-dunk fest that will showcase the athletic talent of its lead actor, Ray Allen (one of the NBA's premier players). Truth be told, however, He Got Game is more a sentimental drama than a sports movie, and the film focuses primarily on the behind-the-scenes pressures, temptations, and betrayals that often confront athletes as they are recruited by major universities or establish their professional careers.  Spike Lee does a nice job of poignantly depicting the complex issues of money, sex, groupies, and greedy agents who prey on aspiring young athletes.

Although not a professional actor, Ray Allen does a splendid job in his role as Jesus Shuttlesworth - a high school senior who is faced with the difficult, high-pressure decision of which college he will attend the following fall. Denzell Washington delievers a spectacular performance as always, this time playing Jesus's father (Jake Shuttlesworth) who is serving a prison sentence for involunarity killing his wife. His mother's accidental death fuels Jesus's intense hatred for his father, but now his father is under pressure from the state governor to persuade Jesus to play basketball for the governor's alma mater. If Jesus agrees to do so, the governor has agreed to commute Jake's sentence. The beautiful Rosario Dawson is quite convincing as Jesus's gold-digging girlfriend with ulterior motives.

Fans of Spike Lee's films will notice several of Spike's regulars returning in cameo appearances in He Got Game, including John Turturro, Lonetta McKee, and Bill Nunn. Basketball personalities such as Dick Vitale, John Thompson, and Rick Fox also appear in the film, adding a sense of realism to the plot.

Much more than a simple basketball film, He Got Game tackles issues of race, class, exploitation, and family relationships. Interestingly enough, Spike Lee employs much more sex in this film than he usually does - porn star Heather Hunter appears in a cameo and Rosario Dawson delivers a sex scene of her own. The most graphic sex scene involves a menage-a-trois between Jesus and two blonde groupies during a recruiting visit to a prospective college.

Ultimately, Jesus discovers that the man he hates most is the cares most for him. Jake does not exploit his son, nor does he manipulate Jesus for personal gain.

He Got Game is a sentimental drama that should appeal to any sports fan, and the acting is complemented by a great soundtrack. Unfortunately, the DVD lacks extras - only a theatrical trailer is provided. An interview with the director or Ray Allen (discussing real-life experiences with the issues dealt with in the film) would have been a great addition.",1118880000,3,2931,5.09375

Onwards, for those open-minded to this kind of thing, this is a great work of art. It features the Oscar winning Denzel Wasington (Training Day) as a convicted murderer who is released conditionally to please society. Basketball star Ray Allen plays Denzel's son, doing what he does best--play basketball. A profound yet entertaining movie, with a slight tinge of abstraction towards its end.
It is one of the few DVD gems I highly recommend for those not offended by the former.",1033603200,,810,4.792857142857143
973831,5,630514415X,"Lee highlights problems not only in the world of professional sports, the ghetto, and race in America, but he does it all while weaving a moving story about basketball, redemption, and the relationship between a father and son. He has big things to say about the sold-out soul of professional athletics, but the film would be remarkable without this social commentary. I don't care if Washington won an Oscar for Training Day, this is truly his greatest performance. Ray Allen is also surprisingly good as the country's best high school basketball player, who is being pursued by everyone from NBA agents to his own girlfriend. The people who dislike this film are always ignorant about good filmmaking, and too involved in their white suburban lives to understand what Spike Lee is attempting to say about a variety of social topics.",1026000000,4,834,4.964285714285714
973902,2,630514415X,"...He Got Game was not quite as good as I thought it should be. Denzel Washington was superb as always, as the jailed father of a basketball player, who is allowed out of jail to help convince his semi-estranged son to attend a certain university. Washington is convincing. His sexual escapades with the relatively untalented Milla Jovovich are not all that believable, although I guess if I had been in prison for so long I might consider Jovovich also. The real life basketball player who plays the basketball star who has to choose his path is all right. He is no actor, though, and his path to decisionmaking is pretty long and boring and there is just a bit too much sex in it. His conniving girlfriend Lala is trying to make him turn pro and is seeing agents on the side. She also has no qualms about not being loyal to him. Misdirected misfire, this film. It is a shame, but it did serve my immediate purposes.",992131200,5,917,4.464285714285714
973903,4,630514415X,"This is a movie about basketball.  It's a Spike Lee film too.  So it's bound to express his well-known love for the game.  As we can expect from him, his view is a fresh, uncompromising one.  There's a harsh reality behind all the exaggerations and hype.
The story surrounds a high-school basketball star with the unlikely name of Jesus and the most important decision he must make in his life -- what college basketball scholarship he will accept. Temptations are everywhere and everyone around him feels entitled to some of his future financial success.  Denzel Washington plays his father who is serving a long prison sentence for murdering his wife, the boy's mother. However, the governor wants the boy to go to his alma mater and therefore grants him a week out of prison to also influence the boy.
Spike Lee's camera seeks out the outrageous details that add the wince, the pow and the dimension to the film.  It explores human nature as well as some ugly truths using the vehicle of the story as an allegory.  The music is an eclectic mix of Aaron Copeland and Public Enemy and somehow it works. And there are also cameo performances by real live basketball players and coaches.
I enjoyed the video and can even forgive the fact that it was a little too long and that some of the acting did not measure up to Denzel Washington's superb performance.  Spike Lee fans will love it.  Recommended.",989712000,,1400,4.658536585365853

973905,1,630514415X,"not so much as reviewing the dvd, but the movie in general. It's REALLY bad, nobody saw it and theres a reason for that. It has no story, the acting is terrible and the ending is the worst part. It leaves the movie viewer with a sense of disgust. Even if you like basketball i suggest you stay away from this movie. Because you will just be wasting your time and will never get the time back in your life. Spike lee is a terrible director and gives other directors bad names because he calls his movies joints, which is pointless. Bad movie i suggest not watching it.

A powerful drama that shouldn't stay  out of any basketball fan's collection.",963532800,2,400,4.940298507462686
973907,4,630514415X,"This is a terrific movie, despite the fact that Spike Lee lost his way in the meandering plot; the ending doesn't make much sense.  And of course, there's a bit of misogny in the portrayal of women.  However, Ray Allen is  wonderful as Jesus Shuttlesworth and Rick Fox is a tasty treat.  I would  love to see him in other movies.
Denzel Washington is a REVELATION.  Of  course I've admired his work for years because he's so handsome.  But I  haven't appreciated his acting ability (aside from his performance in  Glory) in quite some time.  This performance is nuanced and subtle and  complex and brilliant.  He's humble and arrogant, noble and low-life, all  in one character. It reminds me of his role in Mississippi Masala.
If  you love NBA basketball, this a great movie to watch.",958089600,5,785,4.669117647058823

973909,4,630514415X,"Spike Lee's film contribution of 1998 marks his greatest graduation as a filmmaker since ""Malcolm X"".  ""He Got Game"" documents the story of Jesus Shuttlesworth, the top high school basketball player in  the U.S. who is receiving incentives one way or the other, to attend  someone's university.  Jesus' father Jake - in prison for accidentally  killing his mother - is offered an early parole in exchange for Jesus'  enrollment at the governor's alma mater.  Jake has one week to convince his  son, who wants nothing to do with him.  This film is really not about  basketball, it is instead, a tale of a father seeking the forgiveness &  respect of his son.  Lee makes good documentation of the cutthroat world of  professional sports recruiting.  Washington, as always, delivers a touching  performance.  Whether asking his son for forgiveness, or giving his wife's  tombstone an embrace, Washington portrays a flawed man in deep need to heal  his family.
Lee had no need to cast an NBA player, but cast Ray Allen  anyway, who does a fine job.  The music, a mix of Public Enemy and Aaron  Copeland, is an odd combination that Lee puts to effective use.  This film  introduced Lee's slower pacing of storytelling, which he would continue to  do with ""Summer Of Sam"", and it works quite well.",952732800,27,1291,4.81651376146789
