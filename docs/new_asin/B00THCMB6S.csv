8701749,4,B00THCMB6S,"Good movie. I like these grimy gritty indie films, and this was a very good one. I'm not familiar with any of the actors, but this was casted very well. Sad ending, especially since the theme is pretty common, of a girl falling in with the wrong crowd, choosing a bad guy over a good one and it effecting everyone.",1493942400,,314,4.25

8701753,5,B00THCMB6S,"This movie was so good. But it broken my heart. I don't cry and I ended up crying so many times. Bring all the tissues. From now on I'll stick to my horror movies.

Please do not misunderstand...This is a FANTASTIC MOVIE.",1476662400,2,221,4.261904761904762
8701754,4,B00THCMB6S,"This is a tragic coming of age story centering around Layla (Jessica Sula) an immigrant from Trinidad living with her estranged mother (Naomi Ryan) in London. Layla hangs out with the wrong crowd and tries to fit in. She falls for Troy (Lucien Laviscount) who does hip-hop videos and allows Layla to be in them. Troy is not the wonderful man she believes and things take a turn for the worse.

I was confused by the brief opening scene which actually comes near the end of the film.

The film was well acted. However, I didn't find viewing a young girl in a downward spiral overly entertaining. This wasn't my cup of tea, but that shouldn't deter people who like well done teen drama/tragedy.
