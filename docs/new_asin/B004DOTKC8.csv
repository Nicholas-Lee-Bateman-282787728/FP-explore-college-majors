4334016,5,B004DOTKC8,I was so happy to receive this disc because it brings back so many memories of laughs from the past.  It reminds us of how much a visit to the theatre can raise our morale when we need it most.,1353974400,4,193,3.825
4334017,1,B004DOTKC8,"this item is a rehash for the most part of the very same films in Comedy Kings and Comedy Classics...if you own either one of those, you will be getting MANY of the same movies in this one..just a different product name and cover picture...the inside is REHASH...Mill Creek does this over and over with their 'bundles' where they put in up to sometimes 50% of the same movies as in another bundle, just naming it differently. i felt VERY VERY ripped off.",1334707200,36,454,4.481927710843373
4334018,5,B004DOTKC8,The movies contained in this set are obscure which makes them more enjoyable. It contains mostly black and white movies which is good because I do not prefer the colorized ones. The only thing lacking is no subtitles for the hearing impaired which these movies should be targeted to. Super smooth transaction!,1301529600,37,309,4.961538461538462

4334030,5,B004DOTKC8,"This video combo pack has all my favorite classic comedies in it, and some new favorites!  I like that they use separate CD sleeves to keep the discs from scratching each other.  I received this a couple weeks ago and I have already watched a few new movies I haven't seen before, and liked them :-) You couldn't get a collection like this for less, and it is worth so much more. If you bought one or two of these movies separately it'd cost you what you pay for these 50 movies!  Great deal.",1437350400,2,492,4.212765957446808

4334043,4,B004DOTKC8,"Package from Amazon Fulfillment arrived one day after the estimated arrival.

Items all in good shape, no damage [in the past, one boxed set arrived smashed]

All three are Mill Creek sets; two sets have one-sided DVDs and large, readable titles. The third is a double-sided DVD format with titles on the DVD that are next to impossible to read. Hopefully, if Mill Creek and others continue to release these collections as more films come into the public domain, the one-sided format will be used.

As for the quality of the transfers, I'm 150 movies away from an opinion on that, however the quality has always been acceptable in the past and I expect it will be the same with these.

Six of the films are duplicated between the sets, which leaves 144, which is okay. My own preference would be for MC to maybe wait a little longer and issue unique collections of highly regarded films that do not include TV dramas and clunker films - put them in special Klunker Kollections of campy movies.

In any case, I am now the proud owner of four Carol Lombard films from Mill Creek - that by itself is very satisfying. Thank you MC.",1402444800,3,1127,4.532019704433497
4334044,1,B004DOTKC8,"I enjoyed the B&W movies. Most of the movies are color movies.
The color movies are out of focus, the colors are extremely faded and have odd colors. The sound is of poor quality.
I would have to use four letter words to describe the people that created these DVDs.",1401580800,4,265,4.32
4334045,4,B004DOTKC8,"Am still going through the discs, but so far,
is a good mix of movies from different decades.
Not sure why are some are classified as comedies,
but they are still good.",1400198400,3,168,4.28125
4334046,4,B004DOTKC8,My husband & I enjoy the older movies for their storylines.  This is a fairly good collection.  We would have preferred that all of the showings would have been from the 30's & 40's......some are from the 60's & 70's which just don't have the quality of entertainment that we like.,1397606400,,281,4.490196078431373
4334047,4,B004DOTKC8,"I have watched some of these movies, but not all. These are some of the movies I grew up with. Most are from the 30's, 40's, and 50's with a few from the 60's and 70's. The great thing about these movies was you never heard any foul language. They were just pure comedy and made for the whole family to watch.",1384300800,2,309,4.0

4334049,2,B004DOTKC8,"Almost all of these movies were simply converted to DVD and were not remastered.  The resulting video and audio are very bad.  Also, the DVD's are not labeled and finding a movie is very hard.",1376352000,4,192,4.457142857142857
4334050,5,B004DOTKC8,"You will love this collection if you like comedy films. It was great for me as I got to see some rare ones I hadn't seen before. Something Special was very good with Patty Duke playing the part of the mother. Others were Angel On My Shoulder with Anne Baxter, That Uncertain Feeling with Merle Oberon andd Eve Arden, Broadway Limited with Patsy Kelly, Eternally Yours with Loretta Young and Eve Arden, The Fat Spy with Jayne Mansfield, Phyllis Diller, and Johnny Tillotson, Three Broadway Girls with Joan Blondell, The Over-The-Hill Gang with Ricky Nelson, It Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time with Stefanie Powers and Yvonne De Carlo, Oh,Alfie with Joan Collins, and a good drama Hoosier Schoolboy with Mickey Rooney.",1374969600,5,720,4.814516129032258

4334052,3,B004DOTKC8,"I have watched about 6 of the discs in the Hollywood Comedy Legends-50 movie pack and have not found the movies to be comedies. Most of them have characters with relationship, financial, employment and/or health problems.  Some of the movies have been enjoyable (because I like old b&w movies), but I expect a comedy to make me laugh, or at the very least make me smile.  The one I'm in the middle of watching now has a married couple with all the problems I listed above and their child has pneumonia!  Nothing funny about that! Some of the actresses/actors are well known for their comedy performances, but so far I haven't seen any of them in this collection.  Keep in mind I am not through the whole collection yet, so maybe there are some really funny ones coming up. I feel the set is worth the price I paid for it (about $11), but I'm disappointed I haven't done any laughing yet.",1373500800,25,887,4.45679012345679
4334053,5,B004DOTKC8,It's fun to go back in time and enjoy the movies of the past. The Hollywood legends should be part of everyone's DVD collection!,1369267200,3,128,4.375

4334055,3,B004DOTKC8,"Some real good movies mixed in with a lot of very poor ones.  Have watched the first five discs and liked about 1/2 the features.

4334057,1,B004DOTKC8,"I would never have paid money for these.  Save your money for a better collection.  Comedy Kings 50 Movis pack is worth the money but this one is a true dog.  Most of the movies in color are such dogs that they just HOWLLLLLLL.  The black and white are OK, but also most are available for free download on the net, from of our tax dollars.

Yes, the picture quality is not the best with some of these films; many of them have not been restored to their pristine yesteryears. If you're a stickler for picture quality from your DVDs, you might not be satisfied with this set.
Viewed on a portable DVD player, the picture quality is pretty good; it's when they are viewed on a HD TV that the picture quality degrades. Still, for the price you'll get a lot of laughs with these collection of comedies.",1493251200,5,622,4.5625
8425804,1,B004DOTKC8,"The video quality is horrid! If I could give this zero stars I would. I am a classic movie buff, but here all movies look as if they were sourced through public domain channels.
