8291710,1,B001D5F37Q,guy walks around 2 cities pointing out what may have been places visited by pink floyd. Nearly 3 hours of interviewing losers who don't know pink Floyd but live in these 2 cities. Unwatchable !,1435449600,,193,4.542857142857143
8291711,3,B001D5F37Q,"This was interesting to see some of the most famous Pink Floyd sites, especially because I live in the US, but I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. One viewing is really enough. They obviously didn't get the rights to use any of the Floyd's music for this documentary so it is interspersed with  a 1990's Pink Floyd sound alike. The extensive and quite unecessary dialog from the presenter is very annoying and the  thing he seems most interested in is whether the audiences at early Floyd shows were under the influence of LSD.  Locations filmed include Roger Waters', Syd Barrett's, and David Gilmour's childhood homes, Grantchester Meadows, Royal Festival Hall, Islington Green School, Mike Leonard's flat, Regent Street Polytechnic, and Britannia Row Studios, among others.  Photographer Jill Furmanovsky, journalist Chris Welch and London Free School founder John ""Hoppy"" Hopkins are all interviewed, but no new tidbits of information really surface.  It is a very amateurishly shot doc with wind noise, traffic noise and pedestrians walking in front of the camera as the presenter is talking.  I definitley would not buy this and I am a huge Pink Floyd fan.  Do yourself a favor and find it online, view once and save your money.",1297468800,10,1238,4.980582524271845
