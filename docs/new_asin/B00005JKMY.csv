1434668,5,B00005JKMY,"I did not see 'Abre Los Ojos', so I watched this movie with no other in mind to compare it with. That said, I really loved this film! The unsettling opening scenes hooked me completely! Many people have tried to explain this film though their reviews, and almost everyone understands it in a different way, so I will not add my own description. Let me just say that it is, among other things, a sad, scary, hopeful story of one man's understanding of his life.
Tom Cruise displays the same manic energy he has in most of his other films, most notably 'Jerry Maguire' (another Crowe film), and 'A Few Good Men'(The ""galactically stupid"" speech). There are times when I really hated David Ames, but that was probably the point. :)
Cameron Diaz is very good, her beauty and vivaciousness superbly twisted into something frightening. Jason Lee, Penelope Cruz and Kurt Russell are a welcome relief when David Ames starts to get a bit wierd, hiding his damaged psyche behind his mask. Kurt Russell is wonderful as the psychologist looking for truth, especially when he finds it.
If I had to explain this to someone, I would say this; imagine if a beautiful David Lynch film had characters you actually liked, and (almost) everything was explained at the end.
Go see this film on it's own terms. Let yourself be unsettled.",1015632000,,1315,4.696969696969697
1434669,4,B00005JKMY,"Rule number one: ""Watch this movie once and for all."" Because if you did not concentrate in the first time you watch it you won't understand it and you'll ruin the movie for youself!
This movie reminded me of both ""The Game"" & ""Fight Club"". The story goes too far beyond reality to an extent that you get DISTURBED! But the end manages to pull all the threads back together!
The problem with this type of movies is that if you do not accept ""swallow"" the ending, you'll never like the movie... but I swallowed it & I liked it!
Both Cruise & Cruz did a GREAT job... personally I think one of the best ""ACTING"" jobs for Tom Cruise is this movie! ...",1015459200,,647,4.225806451612903

It won't work  the pieces don't fit each other  there is no picture   call it Vanilla Sky. Cameron Diaz is great (which is why I gave it 3 stars).  I guess Cameron Crowe had a bad movie in him just itching to get out and this was it.  It appears Crowe showed up on the set each day and directed a scene  next day he has a different idea for the movie and shoots that. He can't make up his mind what movie he is making but just keeps filming scenes. Finally, he feels he has shot enough film and randomly splices the various pieces together and announces it as Vanilla Sky.  The movie is worth seeing for Diaz's performance.....Crowe ends up with a lemon.",1516233600,,795,4.184210526315789

1434776,5,B00005JKMY,"Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise are really at their best here in this think piece about reality, illusion and how to decide between the two when given the choice. The theme of the movie is that its never too late to decide. And even though a Bildungsroman-like character transformation for a mid-30s playboy like David might seem a little far-fetched at first, by the time of the end of the movie, not only do we guess what Davids decision would be, we know why.

I was 19 when I made my first turn toward living an unpleasant truth instead of a pleasant illusion, and I have, I hope, made that decision consistently throughout my life. Most recently, that includes the events that my Randall Nowan character describes in various reviews.  And, like David, I have no regrets.",1491955200,,772,4.627737226277373

Finally introduced this movie to my friends and the movie was funnier than I had remembered primarily because David's best friend who we all thought was extremely similar in character to Ryan Reynolds was hilarious.

You will best enjoy it if you watch it with an open heart and mind (and not be obsessed with it making sense immediately). If you ""absorb"" it at the pace of the film, you will likely ""get it"" - at some point - even perhaps sometime after the film ends. EVEN after you ""get"" it, there appears to always be MORE layers, symbolism, heart break, life lessons, hope, etc - with each and every viewing.

1434971,4,B00005JKMY,"I am on Amazon to order the Blu Ray format with the alternate endings (I have the original on DVD).  There are few films I want to watch repeatedly, and this is one.  The original release of the film was around December 2001, not long after the 9/11 tragedy.  I lost a friend that day in the World Trade Center, and when I first saw Vanilla Sky in the theaters it stirred up a lot of emotion being set in NYC, in particular scenes with David Ames on top of the building overlooking Manhattan and beyond (I won't describe the scene further to give anything away).  I just found the film emotional and moving with the visuals, the soundtrack and the story itself.  There are some really cool scenes; to see David Ames standing in Times Square without a single soul around is a haunting but beautiful image.  The scene of him tearing out of The Dakota in his vintage sports car to Radiohead's ""Everything In Its Right Place"" is a great opener.  The soundtrack is impressive too (Radiohead, Sigur Ros, The Chemical Brothers, Jeff Buckley, Red House Painters...).

1435042,4,B00005JKMY,"""Vanilla Sky""(2001 is directed by Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous). This is a psychological sci-fi film with a strong romantic angle. Penelope Cruz reprises her role from the Spanish film ""Open Your Eyes""(1997) which this film was based upon. The film is like a maze with flash backs and hallucinations as Tom Cruise's character is involved in a car accident which changes his life forever. Just as David Aames (Tom Cruise) is trying to understand what has happened to him so too the viewer is trying to figure out dream from reality, and truth from untruth.

The dvd has a couple of featurettes including ""Prelude to a Dream"", and ""Hitting it Hard"", as well as a Paul McCartney interview, and a feature long commentary with the director.",1439596800,,735,4.833333333333333

1435074,2,B00005JKMY,"I have watched many movies that used illusion and surprise endings but this was probably the worst of them. Lets go over a few movies from the classic era of film making. First, The Big Sleep. A favorite of mine, it was regarded at the time as very difficult to follow and had what many believed to be several loose ends. Upon watching the movie many times I have been able to tie up the loose ends that folks asked questions about (which never bothered me and didn't really detract from the movie at all). There was never anything visually difficult about watching The Big Sleep. The actors spoke plainly. The scenes were as you saw them - nothing was hidden.

The second movie that comes to mind is also from the classic era of movies. The movie is Mildred Pierce. A surprise ending. Nothing visually difficult to follow. A great movie.

Witness for the Prosecution - great movie. Surprise ending. Great stuff.

Fast forward to the spy classic ""The Spy that Came in From the Cold."" Le Carre classic. Again, a surprise ending but nothing visually distracting.

Other movies come to mind but to relieve the reader of wondering where this is all leading I will now turn my attention on Vanilla Sky.

I like Tom Cruise. I consider him a very good actor. And he does a great job here. What is sour about this movie is the constant rehash of similar scenes. Visually the movie is very hard to watch. Mentally the movie caused me to turn it off to avoid losing it.

I don't like movies that have to rewind every scene eight times. Not only does it make the thread of the movie hard to follow but you have to go back and watch scenes over and over again to figure out just what happened.

I have never had to watch scenes from Mildred Pierce or The Big Sleep multiple times to figure out what was being conveyed. There are other great modern movies that also were not as visually or mentally distracting as Vanilla Sky such as Night Train to Lisbon.

I know I will never watch this movie again. Which is a shame. If this movie is as great as people say it is then I would want to watch it over and over again. The MI movies by Tom Cruise for instance have twisting plots. The Bourne movies were excellent. Ludlum always used a twisting plot. His books can be mind bending to read but the movie versions resolve that very well. Whereas I enjoy watching The Rhinemann Exchange miniseries over and over again this movie will be returned to the library and never checked out by me again.

Which is perhaps a shame. I can think of ways that it could have been done with less distraction. But I am not being paid millions to do that ... ;)",1436572800,,2627,4.366803278688525

1435286,4,B00005JKMY,"Sometimes a film comes along which doesn't quite add up and soon after watching it you hit the web looking for an explanation of the story and what really happened, even then it's not quite clear. Certainly a film that requires multiple viewings to get the most out of it.

**Spoiler Alert** (well even with the story explained you don't give much away)

Story wise we have Tom Cruise playing David Aames a thirty something rich and successful owner of a publishing company. Early on we see David in a cell with a mask on covering his face talking to psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe (played by Kurt Russell). We get flashbacks to past events showing David and his fast paced care free love life with ex girlfriend ""Julie"" Gianni (Cameron Diaz) and his new love interest Sofia Serrano (Penlope Cruz)

When Julie hears about David's involvement with Sofia she crashes her car with David in it as a passenger, leaving him horribly disfigured and having to wear a mask.

Sounds simple enough to digest but things get a bit more ""odd"" as time moves on. David meets Sofia after the accident and starts to see her, she helps him come to terms with what has happened, physically and mentally. But on a night out David gets drunk and is left on the street where he sleeps until he wakes the next morning to see Sofia there again. After a while David gets his face repaired by some of the top plastic surgeons in medicine, but is experiencing strange thoughts and flashbacks. He sees an unusual man Edmund Ventura (Noah Taylor) who says strange things to him and he seems out of place with events.

Things take a turn for the worse when David is in bed with Sofia and think he sees Julie lying there, his hurt and anger means he strangles her (hence his appearance in the prison and the psychologist) David sees an advert for ""Life Extension"" a cryonic service which freezes people to bring back later on just after death. He later meets the same odd man (he saw earlier who looked out of place) he is ""tech support"" for the life extension.

The tech support man explains what happened to David during his life (evidently the real events that occurred) and tells him he's been in suspension for 150 years, offering him a choice of waking up now..or correcting the dream and putting him back into cryonic suspension. The film ends with the choice being made. (I won't spoil that part)

You can grasp some parts of the story by the presence of the tech support man (ie that David's dream is going wrong) On the other hand you're never really sure if the events even took place (or what events were real), and the final ending leaves the door wide open to the inevitable if school story ish ""but was it all a dream"" clich (but for some reason you're more willing to accept that).

It's not quite as cryptic and bizarre as ""Mulholland Drive"", but it's far from clear cut either. There are a number of interpretations of the story and ending, but I'll let you do the research on that. The film is well directed, with a good cast and script Cruise fits into the part well and the supporting cast are also strong. This is just one of the odd ball films out there you'll hate with a passion or really like.

I enjoyed watching it, but it's a bit like pickled onions with jam and Marmite on toast (all at the same time)..it's not really normal for breakfast :-) This is certainly not a normal film. If you fancy something a bit out there, this might be a film you'll really enjoy..sort of.",1413849600,2,3469,4.47626582278481

The wait for this Blu-ray release has been a cruel joke.  On three separate occasions the release date came and went so when I FINALLY got a shipped notification you can imagine my surprise...

This is a budget line release; it is a single disc, no booklet and no more extra features than the DVD release other than the alternate ending.  The DTS soundtrack sounds exactly like the DVD release; no lossless HD sound here...  The digital transfer goes all over the place from stunning to obvious standard definition with jittery transitions and frame stutters.  Perhaps the ridiculously long wait gave me unrealistic expectations... However, the excellent visuals and cinematography of Vanilla Sky could have been greatly enhanced by a top-notch 1080p transfer.

1435440,5,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky shows us the daring BioDigital actor Tom Cruise displaying his shapeshifting eyes at a record-setting pace. Hollywood is entirely 'BioDigital' - which means they are humans who host a digital copy of a Reptilian alien known as 'Number 6'. Because 'Number 6' is copied into so many human hosts, the conspiracy is known as '666' - a reference to the ubiquity of 'Number 6'.
Every Hollywood actor displays shapeshifting eyes - but only Tom Cruise would base an entire performance on non-stop shapeshifting. BioDigitals flash these Reptilian eyes SUBLIMINALLY. The method is to only shapeshift at a distance (never in close-up) and to shapeshift very quickly (most shapeshifts happen within fractions of a second). Ordinary humans cannot see these moments of subliminal disclosure because we were genetically engineered to be dim-witted and imperceptive...however, with the advent of DVD technology, humans can now use ZOOM and frame-by-frame to perceive these subliminal moments.
 Vanilla Sky gives us a rare glimpse at a renegade BioDigital (Cruise) who practically ignores the #1 rule of shapeshifting throughout the film. Cruise displays his shapeshifting eyes relentlessly AND IN NEAR CLOSE-UP. (If you doubt this Proven Fact, simply use your Zoom and Frame-By-Frame abilities to investigate your own copy of this film on DVD or Blu-ray.)
 But WHY would Cruise do such a thing? It's very simple: Actors use their ability to shapeshift their eyes to subliminally convey certain aspects of the characters they portray. Shapeshifting always happens for a reason. Most of the time, actors display slitted eyes to convey homicidal or cold-blooded Reptilian emotions (Angelina Jolie displayed a slit as she taunted Brittney Murphy in ""Girl, Interrupted""). Deceptions are also accompanied by slitted eyes. But also, actors can use this ability to convey the special or powerful nature of a character (for example, Christopher Reeve flashed his BioDigital eyes frequently to portray Superman). Guilt is another emotion that is conveyed by displays of slitted eyes (Halle Berry displayed her guilty BioDigital eyes to portray her character in ""The Call""). In ""Vanilla Sky"" Cruise decided to incessantly flash his BioDigital eyes for a very specific reason: To convey the dream-like nature of the world his character is experiencing. Cruise plays a man lost in a techno-nightmare dreamworld where nothing is real...as we see his relentless BioDigital eyes, we subliminally perceive the world of the film to be surreal.
 Tom Cruise also used his uniquely bold approach in the film ""Eyes Wide Shut"". The title of this Kubrick film refers to the perceptual blindness of Humanity...who look, but don't SEE the BioDigital actors shapeshifting their eyes in most all movies and TV shows. The counter-intuitive nature of shapeshifting may surprise many humans...for example, the slits do NOT remain inside the eyelids. A BioDigital will often display a slit that extends ABOVE the human eyelid - sometimes even going up to the eyebrow. This 'clown slit' is the classic example of how they shapeshift. It's also possible for a BioDigital to display their entire iris OUTSIDE of and ABOVE their eyelid (Jack Nicholson did it to portray the possessed axe murderer in ""The Shining"").
 The major preoccupation of all BioDigitals is ""The All-Seeing Eye"". This entity watches their minds and controls them in a god-like manner. BioDigitals use a form of symbolism to allude to this 'Eye'...it's known as 'One Eye Symbolism' and we see it in ""Vanilla Sky"". The film depicts a savior character named 'Sophia' who can help Cruise escape from his false world...Cruise draws pictures of 'Sophia' as a 'one eye' subject in the film. (The concept of the 'Eye' as a guide to help us escape from a false world is referred to as 'Gnosticism' by many.)
Another intriguing moment in ""Vanilla Sky"" occurs when Katie Holmes is subliminally displayed immediately after the image of a baby is flashed on the screen. This moment is typical of the BioDigitals - who know the future through the ""All-Seeing Eye"" and constantly hint at what the future holds. Cruise and Katie Holmes were both in committed relationships with other people when ""Vanilla Sky"" was made in 2001...they wouldn't get together until 2005. This sort of thing is going on all the time in movies and Art. For example, James Gandolfini died of a heart attack...but in one of his final films, ""Burt Wonderstone"", he is depicted as suddenly dropping like a heart attack victim who experiences sudden death. BioDigitals also relentlessly 'in-joked' about the 911 Twin Towers for many years before they were destroyed. These references are ubiquitous and can be seen on many YouTube videos. In ""Vanilla Sky"", such a reference is made: The 'technical support' man stands on the roof with the Twin Towers just over his shoulder as he refers to ""The Sour"" experiences in life. (""Vanilla Sky"" was released BEFORE the 911 attack.)

My biggest bone of contention was at the end of the movie with the choice of how he 'faced his fear' - it was not done in a way that made any sense.  (Spoiler alert)  If you want to face your fear of heights, you don't do it by jumping off the top of a sky scraper.  That, instead, is the definition of how to commit a very permanent suicide!  They should've had him bungie jumping or sky diving - duh!  Yes, it was a bit slow in places & yes, the guy was a major superficial narcissistic douche-bag but I'm don't think the punishment fit the crime, so to speak.  Sci-fi aspect was only a little bit & only revealed in the technology used at the end of movie.  Otherwise it was mostly a confusing series of weird flashbacks, some real, some not real & what was what is not revealed until the end.  I would classify more as a psychological thriller.  It was all about actions & consequences, guilt & conscious vs subconscious.

After the that,we get treated to many weird and out-of-this world events the film transforms into a surrealistic and psychological drama. I had to see this film twice to fully understand and to fully appreciate the story. It is not a film for everyone as it consists of symbols and meanings. The performances and the soundtrack were great. The only thing that bothered me is the Lucid Dream option part as it somewhat maneuvered from the film's genre although I felt that the producers had to do it for it to become commercially viable for movie fans who are not into deep thinking despite the presence of Tom Cruise,who definitely has been a box office movie draw for many decades now.",1405382400,,989,4.722543352601156

1435520,4,B00005JKMY,"I'm going to start off with a spoiler because it seems to me that everyone else has covered the crazy aspects of this movie down to a tee.

The saddest moment in this movie, the one that struck me the most was when David looks in the mirror and waves goodbye to himself.

I actually got teary eyed when I saw this and, I guess I have to give Tom Cruise credit for nailing the body language down. It was so sad to me that someone after ingesting a lethal dosage of pills, just waved goodbye to themselves. I'm thankful that I've not been surrounded by anyone who has attempted suicide, but it definitely made me feel bad for the person who felt that it was their only option left.

Not only was the cinematography, color, and acting emotionally engaging, but the realization that this man is about to die alone was just . . . I don't have the words.

Look, this movie is weird, okay? It's hard to follow because you don't know what's real and what's not. It is a never ending chain of waking up into a dream into another dream into what he one day hopes to be reality.

Some people hate Tom Cruise's character David and some people can't get over how the film switches genres. From thriller to sci-fi, it's a real mix of different elements and themes.

The movie kept me interested, but I'd be lying if I didn't doze off for a few minutes and start wondering when the movie was going to end.

I'm not quite sure where to put my finger on it. I'd say that overall I enjoyed the movie, but I can't say I'd recommend it as a must-see. It's very different, feels very unique, and if the crazy plot doesn't drive you mad, who knows, maybe you'll like the movie too.",1402099200,,1659,4.247619047619048

1435615,5,B00005JKMY,"When I first watched this movie, I couldn't get past the 45:00 minute mark.  It really looked to me like the movie was a confusing, psychotic montage of self-indulgent crap.  It didn't seem to have a point; it was going around in circles and stagnating, aimless, drifting.  So I stopped it there.  I thought about never picking up the movie again, but, hoping for the best, I went to the end of the movie instead.

I am very glad I did.  The end of the movie puts the first 90-95% of the film in perspective, and it does it with aching beauty and aggressive poignancy.  Once I understood the ending, the whole rest of the film took on a magical sheen and depth that was not there to my eyes before.  I don't normally watch movies more than once, but this one called for just that.

I enjoyed the acting.  Penelope Cruz was perfect for the role of Sofia.  She was gentle, slightly naive, sweet, loving, and soulful.  Kurt Russell played the role of psychologist McCabe with convincing thespian maturity.  The role seemed completely natural to him, and it was a pleasure to see a veteran actor giving a perfectly tuned performance.  Jason Lee was spot-on with his character as well.  Well done.",1397952000,,1192,4.530516431924883

Personally, I enjoyed it and thought that Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz were great in their roles. The story and subject are definitely interesting and the film is experimental in many ways. Again, you'll either love it or hate it. The weak parts for me were the moments of slower pacing, where scenes were longer than needed to be. And some of the supporting cast (Jason Lee) seemed a little weak when acting next to the main roles. Overall, this ends up being a science fiction film that starts out with a non-science fiction feel. I enjoyed it and would watch it again.",1396742400,,678,4.475806451612903

A very well edited and rather artistic film.  The story line is part science fiction and tragic love story.  The cast is superb.

From Rain Man to Magnolia, Born on the Fourth of July to Top Gun, the guy can act. I never saw this movie when it was released because the critics blasted it, but I have learned to not always believe critics. While looking for a movie to watch on my Fire, I decided to take a chance.

I was enthralled from the beginning. It is a weird, confusing, acid trip of a movie, and I don't usually get into those types, but this time it worked. Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz earned new respect from me, and Kurt Russell was amazing. I am still not sure whether to categorize this movie as drama or science fiction, but I guess it doesn't matter. Give the film a chance.

1436080,5,B00005JKMY,"After years of relentless searching online for updates on this blu ray release, it's finally on its way. One of my all time favourites and a day 1 purchase regardless of price. I live in the UK so will be importing this as no UK release date as yet, and will hopefully be region free if it's from Paramount.

I just hope they go to town on the PQ and AQ and throw in a shed load of extras.

I never tire of watching this. There's always something going on that's relevant to the plot. A very satisfying film with emotions on various levels. A lost love story? Sci fi? Dream world? Total Recall? Make your own mind up. I agree with the other reviewer completely that the story plays out as the director intended and that what you see actually happens. To me there's no point over-analysing the plot or changing the real story when there's no need. Just sit back, concentrate and take it all in (then watch it again!). This movie is far to intricate to be simply a 'Bobby Ewing steps out of the shower' type event!

 I never understand those that say they don't 'get it'. One poll even has this listed as the most confusing movie of all time - really?? (Donnie Darko anyone!?). The mystery here is fully explained by 'tech support' towards the end of the movie - complete with flash backs!

Great visuals and a great soundtrack. Should have a new lease of life in DTS HD.

I don't want to wish the months away, but April 2014 can't come quick enough!

As for the 1 star reviewer suggesting tom cruise should just kill himself for real on screen - clearly you're one of those who didn't 'get it'.

I imagine most people viewing these reviews have already seen the movie and know what to expect. But for those that haven't, grab this cult movie on blu ray for the first time. It's well overdue.

1436143,5,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is simultaneously a completely original piece of art, and yet is also based on a Spanish film from a few years before, ""Abre Los Ojos"" (Open Your Eyes) which also starred Penelope Cruz in the same role that she plays in Vanilla Sky.

Sky is staying fairly close to the source material, yet it has created this world that Tom Cruise finds himself in that is unlike anything else.  This film is not something that is easily digested, or something that you can put on in the background and just pay cursory attention, and then expect to follow it.

This is something you have to pay attention to, and potentially watch multiple times to truly enjoy and appreciate what director Cameron Crowe has created.

Crowe came out years ago explaining that there are three or four different interpretations of the ending of the film, and just what is going on with Cruise's character.  While some may argue that there's only one true explanation, as I look back on the film I can see how it is very easy to come to the conclusion that it is one of any of those three or four explanations.

Excellent performances by Cruise, Cruz and Cameron Diaz, along with great supporting performances by Jason Lee (Chasing Amy, Enemy of the State, My Name is Earl) and Kurt Russell (Unlawful Entry, Fast & The Furious 7).

This film got mixed reviews when it came out, yet has developed a cult following since.  I think it's the ambiguity that is found within this film that has encouraged the mixed reviews.  Some loved it, others despised it, and many others were just flat out confused.  As I said, it's not a popcorn film.  It's not a typical Tom Cruise movie that you don't really have to think about.  This is not a Jack Reacher or a Top Gun type movie.

This is an intelligent and thought provoking work of art that demands multiple viewings to truly appreciate.

If you give it your attention, and ""Open Your Eyes"", then perhaps you will be rewarded with an enjoyable experience.

One of my all time favorite films is finally coming out on Bluray, which makes me very happy.

Sidenote, according to the official Cameron Crowe website ""The Uncool"", they are planning on a brand new commentary track along with bonus deleted scenes that were cut from the film.  I imagine they are going to stuff this sucker full of extras, both from the other release on DVD and brand new ones strictly for this release.

I saw it when it first came out, in the theater, and have wanted to see it again, ever since.. the themes, the story, the cinematography, the acting - are all great.  It's one of those movies you can watch over and over, and gain more insight into people, relationship, life, reality, priorities  each person can arrive at different conclusions, and get a unique experience from the movie it's more like a ""question"", a ""challenge"" to think.. to dig deep into our own lives and minds, our own fears and perceptions of reality and life  kind of like a mirror what we get from the movie reflects ourselves  I don't particularly like Tom Cruise or Cameron Diaz, but in this film, their parts are perfect for their abilities.",1384041600,,744,4.571428571428571

1436251,2,B00005JKMY,"I had seen the movie a long time ago and didn't get it, even though I watched it in its entirety. I know that this movie generally has received good reviews so I decided to give it another chance on Amazon Streaming, I thought maybe there was some profound message in it in a second viewing. Generally I like Tom Cruise movies so this review doesn't reflect on him. This was one of the few movies that I had to just stop watching after 30 minutes because I found it totally unintelligible despite the excellent cast. The pacing of the movie (dialog) is glacially slow as opposed to police procedurals which are usually fast paced like Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. This is a framed movie set in the future that jumps back into past flashbacks, in this lies a major problem, there is no real suspense built up here, no motive. We see the relationship with Cruz, Diaz, and the best friend but the best friend so easily gives up on Penelope Cruz that it's hardly even a love triangle. The dream sequences try to be profound but are neither very surreal, or interesting. He's running through Time's Square by himself, all it makes me think of is how they closed off Times Square at 5 a.m. one summer Sunday. Another problem you are always aware of the big stars on the screen, they don't inhabit believable characters, so you are watching Cruise play Tom Cruise he could be in Cocktail, Days of Thunder, etc. Diaz could be in Something about Mary, and Penelope Cruz in any Pedro Almodovar movie. I just hope to save viewers the pain of paying for this movie, unfortunately, I wasted $2.99.",1376524800,,1584,4.503472222222222

1436304,5,B00005JKMY,"While this film received a great deal of criticism, I greatly enjoyed it. It isn't your typical popcorn movie. While it is a remake, I have yet to watch the original, but I like the move on numerous levels. The story is different than the usual, and takes several twists, some you see coming, some you wont, and ends on a twist you really don't expect. As the details unfold, it makes you want to watch it again to see the clues that are there, but easily missed as you are so wrapped up in the narrative you don't notice them. This is a film I can watch over and over again.",1375401600,,575,4.142857142857143

1436306,3,B00005JKMY,"Confusing and somewhat nonsensical until the last 30 minutes when all is made clear, Vanilla Sky is an odd conflation of psychological thriller and science fiction. It's not a great movie, the original Spanish movie was far superior, but it was entertaining. Tom Cruise plays his usual over-confident douchebag role to the hilt, as he always does. If ever anyone needs an unpleasant character with few to no redeeming qualities, he is the go to guy. But his come-uppance is interesting as is the twist at the end. You could do worse, a good popcorn movie. You won't be disappointed if you don't expect cinematic grandure.",1374969600,,621,4.867924528301887

Despite an ending that was a bit hokey, it did tie up the story very well and left me satisfied.  I can honestly say I didn't see it coming.  I knew something weird was going on, but never suspected the truth.
The acting was very good and while Tom Cruise is a great actor, he is always...well, Tom Cruise.  His character seemed to be the same as every other movie he has ever been in.  It's worth watching for Penelope Cruz if nothing else as she comes across as so lovable, almost like an adorable puppy that you would do anything for.  She was very genuine in her performance.",1368835200,,675,4.2015503875969

1436425,5,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is one of those films that lingers in your mind after viewing,It is the story of a rich arrogant man (Tom Cruise) who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth due to his father leaving him a publishing empire. It is also about the consequences of his actions,and about not being careless with people. In making a decision to get into a car with someone David (Cruise)ends up paying one hell of a price when his life is altered forever,in the process he loses his good looks,he loses the woman he loves Sofia (Penelope Cruz)and almost loses his empire as well as his mind in the process. I realize that this film is based or inspired by a spanish one called Abre los Ojos i unfortunately haven't seen it so i will not compare both films,what i will say is that Vanilla Sky is in my opinion a rare film that makes the viewer think and feel many things..I highly recommend it for anyone that has not yet seen it.",1361664000,7,922,4.304597701149425

Also ruined of course by the most overrated actor I can think of - Tom Cruise. Please someone tell me why you like him. I mean as an ACTOR, not just a pretty (to some women and gay men) face. I could act better and I've never acted. Every time he says something, it's as if he is reading a script. I wonder if they have a monitor with the words on it for him. He's like a karaoke actor!

I'll give it two stars though just for the sake of the other actors in the film who had the bad luck to have to play across from Cruise in this silly nonsensical piece of wannabe profundity.",1361404800,,775,4.132450331125828

1436462,5,B00005JKMY,"I have NEVER placed a review on any movie I have ever seen on Amazon Prime. I have had an Amazon Prime account for 2 years and must have seen over 200 movies. This was the best movie I have ever seen.  Why? because the canvas of the what's happening in David Ames (Tom Cruise's) life real or a dream? I understand how some of the reviewers who gave this one star would. You notice how the ratings are either 5 star or 1 star? If you like reality shows, you will not like this movie.

I wish I would have seen this movie when it came out in 2001 as I know it would have changed how I dealt with relationships. The lesson from this movie is that life is finite, and you should cherish the good times when they happen. The good times are like magic. Just like the interactions between David and Sofia.

I am surprised that this movie gathered no awards and some of the professional reviews blather on about themes such as ""eternal life"" , ""guilt"" and the ""power of the unconscious mind"". Those themes are all footnotes to the main topic being that the good times don't last and you'd be smart to take care of them when they happen.",1360368000,,1128,4.212962962962963

1436501,1,B00005JKMY,"Ok, when I saw this movie almost 12 years ago, I didn't really get many aspects. I was young, unexperienced in the area of love and relationships, but beyond all that, it didn't catch my attention. I thought the plot was slow and confusing (remember that movies like Eternal sunshine and Inception hadn't been made yet), and the acting, well, I never really liked Tom Cruise as an actor, he makes 1 one acceptable movie out of 5. I was dissapointed with Cameron's performance. I've loved her acting for years, I couldn't believe she signed for such a secondary role. I think Penelope Cruz will never ever learn how to speak English properly...c'mon after more than a decade and she stills speaks with the Spanish accent. She should take advice from Antonio Banderas, the only Spaniard who managed to speak English without the annoying Spanish accent. Some time later after watching this version, I saw the original: total copy from the beginning to the end but without the Hollywood budget jje. Did not like it either; and frankly I don't remember anything at all. I do believe Amenabar is a great director and he did great with ""The others"", which is part of my blu-ray collection now.
Time jump to tonight. I was zapping through channels and found Vanilla Sky, I must have watched about 45 minutes, it had just begun. I stopped short time after the car crash scene. That dialogue I didn't quite understand 12 years ago, surprisingly now it's pretty clear. He deserved what she did to him. After suffering myself for three years with a guy pretty much like Tom in this movie; I just imagined myself doing the same to my ex, but without killing myself on the way. And I'm pretty sure lots of women have been in Julie's situation too. The rest of the movie is still completely forgettable.
For the chemistry between Cruise and Cruz, well it doesn't exist. It never did, not even when they were a couple. On the other hand, I do own ""Knight and Day"" in blu-ray, where Cameron and Tom showed they chemistry much better. Thanks God, Cameron never married Tom in real life, she could have been part of the collection of ""Tom's unlucky wives"". Just a joke, but the guy is starting to remind me of King Henry VIII..",1354492800,4,2208,4.606598984771574

Cruise's ability to be ugly on various levels was gut-wrenching in this movie: he is very raw and very exposed.

Even in the beginning, the story of publisher David Aames (Tom Cruise) starts off as a dream. Things start to go weird after he is disfigured in a car accident, even imagining that his dead sex buddy (Cameron Diaz) is his current flame (Penelope Cruz).

Halfway through the show, though a series of dreams alternating with reality, I wondered if I was going insane. In this sense, Vanilla Sky is that good.

The cast put up generally robust performances. You really need to concentrate as I gave up sitting through the first viewing.

The reality of David's situation is revealed towards the end. Even then, there is a playful yet disconcerting thought going through your mind - now is this for real or what?

1436595,4,B00005JKMY,"I first watched this film on DVD in May 2003 and was absolutely blown away by it. It was the only time I've ever gotten that cinematic buzz (albeit on DVD) from any movie and I still have yet to feel as strongly about any other film as I once felt about this film. After my first viewing I couldn't wait to watch it again a 2nd time the next evening after work. I thought about it all day at my office. I must have watched it 10 times in that first week. I was so excited about it I wrote a very long review and posted it on one of those free websites that were so prevalent on the Internet about 10 years ago (this is before Facebook, of course). And I had a full size Vanilla Sky movie poster in my apartment at the time. For several years it was hands down my favorite film.

However, nearly 9 years later I feel differently about the film and I can understand other people's views that the movie is shallow and the story unreasonable at times. Though there are many people who will be confused about the plot and this is what ruins the movie for them, there are those that understand the movie and still don't like it and I think there are many valid criticisms of the film. Most notably Sofia's shallow ""love"" of David. When Sofia meets David in the club after the car accident, and even when she first sees him at her dance studio, it is obvious that she can't get over the fact that he ain't good looking anymore. But perhaps we ought to at least give her character credit that she doesn't stay with him for his money! But when you think of it, why shouldn't she be shallow? They spent one evening together, albeit an evening that had a lot of relationship promise, but one evening none the less. I think most of us have had something like this happen to us in our personal life. Not with a disfiguring car crash mind you, but a glimpse of a love that might have been that never happened for one reason or another. Isn't David's inability to not be able to get over this a little pathetic? In fact it is so pathetic that he decides upon it for his lucid dream.

But even with valid criticisms of the plot, the movie is still a wonderful film that may just take you on an emotional journey and it is visually stunning at times. And even watching it earlier this evening for the first time in years I was surprised that the hairs on my arms stood up during the ""your not Sofia"" scene. Those of you that have seen it know what I'm talking about! Though I enjoyed re-watching it, I think how we view and feel about a film changes with time. A movie impacts us in part because of where WE are at in our life at the time of the viewing. 10 years later, things change, you change, and your view of the film changes.

With my latest reviewing I really see how some viewers were disappointed with the film, in particular the ending. Learning that David has been in a lucid dream and is frozen for half of the film is OK, but the final scenes with David and the ""tech support"" guy and when David says goodbye to Sofia I now feel are pretty weak. And Penelope's acting just seems off to me in many parts of the film. Perhaps it was a cultural or language barrier issue.

However, there are still some good revelations and insights at the films conclusion. David realizes ""I lost you when I got in that car."" And this is a valuable lesson for anyone to heed about how choices impact your life. And how sometimes life seems to test you to see what you will do.

I'm very surprised that this film has not been offered on Blu Ray. Many of Cruise's films have been released on Blu Ray and many of them older than this film. I am curious how Cruise feels about this movie today. In the DVD commentary 10 years ago he certainly seemed proud of the film. I wonder how he views it in his career present day.

Despite some reservations about the film this is a movie I recommend to friends who haven't seen it without hesitation. It's the first movie that comes out of my mouth. Because if you hate it, oh well. All you have lost is a DVD rental. But this film has the capacity to be truly special for some people depending upon where they are at in their life at the moment.

If you haven't listened to the DVD commentary yet, you should. It clears up a lot of things that many people might find confusing about the film and offers some nice insights. I often listen to DVD commentary on films that I like, but Vanilla Sky by far has the best movie commentary of any I've ever listened to. It's as good as watching the film!

FINAL GRADE: A-",1327708800,3,4528,4.2025316455696204
1436596,2,B00005JKMY,"Obviously this is a controversial movie.  People seem to love or hate it.  You can see that just in how people evaluate each other's reviews here on Amazon.  On every review with a strong opinion you get many people who agree or disagree with the review, and I cannot find many reviews that everyone agrees with.  I also had a strong reaction to this movie, and I respect that others loved the very things I hated.  I ask that others only consider how these plot elements could have looked from a different point of view.

I feel that Vanilla Sky could have been one of the greatest movies ever made. Instead, it is a confusing, poorly developed, and poorly assembled mess. I am not frustrated. I am angry. I am angry that such a good basic premise for a story was wrecked.

The following remarks will ruin the movie for anyone who has not seen it and does not want to have secrets revealed in advance. But there is no way to explain my anger without being specific.

Here is the story that this movie was trying to tell:

1) Successful young man - played by Tom Cruise - meets woman of his dreams - played by Penelope Cruz - and the two discover true love.

2) Young man makes tragic decision which results in a horrible accident that permanently disfigures him.

3) Young man dies and is put into cryogenic suspension, and at some point in the far future is placed into a lucid dream where he gets to act out any pleasant thoughts, fantasies, or desires he wants.

4) Young man realizes at end that this dream is not real, and chooses to exit the dream and enter the real world.

For this story to create a meaningful dilemma that makes the choice in 4) painful and difficult, we must believe the premise in 1) that Sofia - the character played by Penelope Cruz - is the love of his life and that she in turn shares similar feelings about him. Unfortunately, the movie fails utterly to achieve this goal. Before his accident, nothing convinces me that these two people have more than a shallow infatuation. There are too few moments shared between them, and too little evidence that either deeply needs the other or deeply fills any needs of the other. These are basic failures in the story telling, not dramatic failures in the acting.

But the dagger through this movie's heart is that once David - the character played by Tom Cruise - has his accident, and finally reintroduces himself to Sofia, Sofia almost immediately rejects him. And there is no explanation of this rejection, leaving us with the distinct impression that she is physically repulsed by his new appearance. This has to be the worst decision in the history of film-making. Instantly the movie's main premise collapses, and Sofia is revealed to simply be shallow. We are left wondering what was the basis of her original affections. Was she simply in love with David's beauty? Her inability to re-connect to the physically ugly David signals a complete lack of depth in her affections. Anyone who had feelings of real love would have needed to reconnect emotionally to the lost lover. Sofia shows no such need, nor does she show any conflicted emotions. To me, her love is a disappointing fraud. (At the end of the movie, Sofia is shown going to David's funeral and wondering about their love, but at this point such a revelation is just confusing and unconvincing. Too little too late...movie already ruined.)

At the moment Sofia rejects David, the movie simply collapsed for me. The fact that the premise in 1) is not believable, makes David's lucid dream in step 3) simply a pathetic revolving act of puppy love and wishful thinking. David might as well be a 20 year old boy who is deeply in love with a girl who doesn't like him, and who dreams of loving her over and over and over, passionately, and without any real point since the love isn't two-way. This makes the decision to exit the dream simply painless for the persons watching the movie, once we realize that after the accident happens, that *EVERY* scene involving Sofia loving David is simply a fraud. All of these scenes are simply part of David's ""Lucid Dream"" in the far distant future.  None of these scenes of Sofia loving David has any basis whatsoever in any actual love. David becomes more like a pathetic drug addict living an unhealthy and habitual existence, addicted to his need for a relationship he wanted but never actually had.

If the story makers had made us believe the premise in 1), then the decision in 4) would have taken on a deep angst - choosing between one's real life before death and the uncertainty of a new life in a new world without family, friends, money, profession, or relevant education and experience needed to cope with a world 150 years in the future. As the movie actually develops, of course I want David to choose reality over his pathetic dream. There is no angst in leaving such a hideous unhealthy rotation of thoughts. Anything is better than such a sick and pointless fantasy existence.

Honestly, the movie is confusing enough that most people won't even grasp the attempt at points 1) to 4) as discrete elements in a story. But to anyone who sees the attempted storyline, the makers of this movie missed a huge opportunity to create something deeply philosophical and troubling and complex and beautiful. A big theme of the movie is that little decisions can have big consequences. Unfortunately, little decisions in the construction of the story had major negative consequences for the film's overall quality and ruined an opportunity to achieve greatness.",1322092800,6,5546,4.664959016393443

1436599,2,B00005JKMY,"Though Vanilla Sky opened up with so much potential, it tried to hard to seem clever, and ultimately turned out to be confusing and incoherent, and not in the good way. It follows Tom Cruise's character, David, as he meets the love of his life one night at a party. When he tries to end his open relationship with another woman the next day, she tries to end both her own life as well as his as revenge. David's life, as well as the story, was fine up until that point, but afterwards, it didn't make any sense, even when I rewinded and watched scenes again.

I admit that I did like the pairing of Penelope Cruz and Tom Cruise--I certainly understood why Cameron Diaz's character was jealous--but that was one of the only redemptive qualities of this movie. After Cruise's character survives the accident, he becomes immature in facing his problems, and creates more problems unnecessarily. Scenes begin shifting more and more rapidly as the movie goes on, and I suppose they do that to make it seem clever, but they ultimately fail. The writers don't really take any aspect of the story in depth, and by the end, you find out a twist that ""might"" make sense, but certainly wasn't interesting enough to watch to its ending. Of course, you might still be confused by the ending, and I wouldn't blame you since many of us felt the same way.

1436660,3,B00005JKMY,"David Aames is a vain and self-centered playboy whose life is changed forever by the beautiful and intelligent Sophia. His new romance is cut short by a scorned lover, who nearly destroys his life and permanently scars him in a horrible car accident. After recovering from a short coma and an ineffective facial reconstruction surgery, David's life is turned upside down when Sophia rejects him based on his new looks, but he awakens one morning to find himself in an ideal world where Sophia falls back in love with him and doctors are able to fix his disfigurement. Things aren't as perfect as they may have seemed, however, as David later describes to a police psychologist after being charged with the murder of Sophia.

VANILLA SKY might only be enjoyed by anyone who had never had the benefit of seeing the original OPEN YOUR EYES by Spanish director Alejandro Amenbar. The choices that were made in both the casting and script revisions in this American remake are simply abysmal. Cameron Crowe lays on a cheap sentimentalism through the film's sappy soundtrack and nostalgic homages to classic cultural influences, but these are only minor distractions compared to the shockingly bad performances by Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, and Jason Lee. It is as if each of these actors mistook the screenplay as a comedy of some sort given their outlandish efforts. Cruise is the film's greatest liability, since his erratic behavior reduces the brilliant character drama into a silly farce. Crowe presumes that his American audience will be far less perceptive than the world viewers that praised the original, so he drops blatant visual clues throughout the film that clearly delineate dreams from reality. In doing so, he eliminates the subtle effectiveness that Amenbar worked so hard to create in his cleverly-designed plot. The beautiful irony in all of this is that the viewer will hope to wake up from the same horrible nightmare that David has found himself in by the end of the movie. Amenbar couldn't have written that better, himself.

1436663,4,B00005JKMY,"The engrossing Dec/2001 film Vanilla Sky is quite the psychological mind bender and it never lets you get too comfortable. Just when you think you see through it all,it switches gears and leaves you scratching your head. I'm not a Tom Cruise fan per se',and while I do think his caliber of work has been spotty over the years,I do have to admit when he does something that is appealing and this is one of those times.
Vanilla Sky is about one David Aames(Cruise) who is heir to a %51 share of his fathers publishing company in New York. He is quite the recalcitrant when it comes to the business end of things,much to the eternal chagrin of the board members he must grudgingly work with and who comprise the ones with the remaining %49 share/control;or the ""seven dwarfs"" as he refers to them. He is young and is enjoying life and has surrounded himself with quite the coterie of friends and hanger-ons. One of the latter is Julianna(Cameron Diaz)who,while a good sexual encounter,harbours deep resentment that David does not understand;yet. His friend Jason(Brian Shelby),a book writer whom he sponsors,introduces him to Sofia(Penelope Cruz) one evening at a party David has thrown and an instant connection is established between the two.
A jealous and uninvited Julianna has shown up at the party and follows David when he takes Sophia home. They sit and talk into the evening hours and when David leaves,Julianna is there to greet him. She talks him into going for a ""drive"" but the drive soon turns into a terribly invective rant against David and how he treats her and others. Suicidal,Julianna ends up going through a bridge railing and down into the street below. She is killed while David barely survives. His face is left horribly disfigured and he has to undergo constant therapy for injuries to his left arm. It takes months of surgery mixed with depression but David finally returns to meet for the first time since the accident with Jason and Sofia at a rave up. When he does he is wearing a prosthetic mask and while trying to put on a brave front his language both verbal and body betray the inward anguish and resentment he really feels. He gets drunk and later accompanies Jason and Sofia home,who end up leaving him to fall asleep on the sidewalk below Sofia's apartment.
He is awoken next day by Sofia whom he starts dating again and their relationship grows deep. David undergoes further extensive plastic surgery and finally gets his face restored to near normal. However strange things start to happen. Not only does he start seeing his old disfigured face off and on in mirrors he is also seeing Julianna as Sofia. Then to top this we find David is in an interrogation room in a jail,being questioned by a psychologist Dr McCabe(Kurt Russell).The doctor is trying to find the truth as to what really happened,while David is trying to grasp onto the reality of the moment. The movies events continue and we switch back and forth between them and the jail as the story is slowly revealed. David's mental state deteriorates rapidly and one night he wakes up in bed with Sofia at first,who then switches to Julianna. He ties her up and calls the police. HE is arrested for apparently beating Sofia(not Julianna) up;who will not press charges. The final straw comes when Sofia and David are in the midst of a passionate love making session and Sofia ""turns"" into Julianna. This time David in a frenzied state suffocates her with the pillow.
Throughout all these seemingly mind boggling events there has been a man popping in and out of scenes. At first he has been in the background staring and later he actually talks to him in a bar. Now with Dr. McCabe and a jail guard in tow they arrive at a place called Life Extension. It seems the mystery man is from the tech support department(Noah Taylor) of the company. David had signed a contract with them to freeze his body and re-animate it years later. Well it is now 150 years later and it appears that David's dream state has gone awry(which tech support detected);which began the night after his sleeping on the sidewalk at Sofia's. Dr McCabe is an illusion as has been every event since then and now he must choose his next step;to continue to sleep or wake up,get reconstructive surgery and continue his life in the real world. At this point he is standing atop a skyscraper over looking New York city with a beautiful Vanilla Sky above(just like the Monet painting his mother so cherished).He has a fear of heights and walking with the doctor means continuing his dreams while jumping brings him back ""home"".He prefers the latter and the film ends as we see both his eyes open for the first time in 150 years.
The plot is certainly an intricate one and I am afraid I cannot do justice to all the nuances built into the story;those you will just have to experience for yourself. But I hope I have given you enough of a taste to whet your appetite for more,for if you stick this movie through you will be amply rewarded in how all the loose and seemingly unrelated ends,come together in the end. Tom Cruise I must say turns in a marvelous performance as the rich playboy turned into a self loathing and tormented man after the crash that disfigures him. Top performances are turned in by all and I must single out Kurt Russell as the psychologist who is a solid addition to the proceedings.
Technically speaking this movie has been transferred well into widescreen and the colours are sharp and crisp. The special features include Commentary,a featurette,a music video,a short interview with Paul McCartney who wrote the title number,the unreleased teaser trailer and the regular trailer.
All in all this is a 135 minute gem,while not everyone's cup of tea,is certainly(to me)an intriguing and engrossing psychological film that keeps you guessing right down to the last few minutes. Highly recommended.",1286755200,4,5878,4.735609756097561

They make up the film for me, if that element wasn't present there i wouldn't bother buying or even seeing the film. Also this movie was the one who made me embark on my own 'Lucid dreaming journey'. For the rest, the movie is normal, take the science fiction out and the movie is just another movie.

1436666,5,B00005JKMY,"David Aames (Tom Cruise) is the head of a vast publishing empire that he inherited from his father. Besides being at the epicenter of all that is hip in Art, Music, and Literature, he also has good looks, youth, and last but not least, lots and lots of money. He is Citizen Kane, or perhaps Citizen something else--the less than flattering nickname his underlings call him behind his back (See comment). He has a 'friends with benefits' arrangement with Julie Gianni (Cameran Diaz) but when he sees Sofia Serrano (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) at his birthday party, he jokes about Julie as a twisted pick up line for Sofia:

---------
David Aames: See, I've got this little problem. I've got a stalker.
Sof&iacute;a: It doesn't sound life threatening.
David Aames: But I need a cover. I need for you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation, and you are wildly entertained.
[Both laugh]
David Aames: I know it's tough.
Sof&iacute;a: I'll improvise.
===================

Whoa! This ploy actually works, but the joke backfires on David Aames. The joke turns out to be the truth.

------------
Sof&iacute;a: I think she's the saddest girl to ever hold a martini.
====================

There are 428 pop culture references in Vanilla Sky, according to writer/director Cameron Crowe. 429 if you count one that was made accidentally. One that was made on purpose was when David Aames (Tom Cruise) walked down the street with Sofia Serrano (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) and it looked just like Robert Zimmerman and Suze Rotolo on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan album cover. Pay attention. This is a clue. There will be a test.

-------------------------
David Aames: My dreams are a cruel joke. They taunt me. Even in my dreams I'm an idiot... who knows he's about to wake up to reality. If I could only avoid sleep. But I can't. I try to tell myself what to dream. I try to dream that I am flying. Something free. It never works...
==============================

Cameron Crowe really knows his cultural references, as he was a child prodigy rock critic who began writing for Rolling Stone while still in High School. He made Almost Famous in 2000, which was a fictionalized autobiography based on his experience, and in 2001 he followed it up with Vanilla Sky. Based on Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's 1997 film ""Abre Los Ojos"" that also starred Pen&eacute;lope Cruz; Vanilla Sky was Crowe's Magnum Opus. His Magnolia. His Citizen Kane, or rather Citizen Blank (see comment). Along with the 429 cultural references he also crammed in Citizen Kane, Magnolia, Mask with Cher, The Mask with Cameran Diaz and Jim Carrey, Franois Truffaut's Jules et Jim, La Belle et la bte by the poet Jean Cocteau, Johnny Handsome with Mickey Rourke, The Matrix, and The Phantom of the Opera. It seems like he put everything but the kitchen sink into Vanilla Sky and it must have broken his heart when he was crucified by the press and the film didn't do so well at the box office, either.

------------------------
David Aames: I wanna wake up! Tech support! It's a nightmare! Tech support! Tech support!
===========================

Perhaps this is just a Minority Report, but I really enjoyed Vanilla Sky. I think it was very ambitious but Crowe was able to pull it off after all. He bit off a lot, but it was NOT--as some critics have suggested--more than he could chew. Some people might have been confused, and others might have thought that it explained itself too much in the end (or did it?), but I thought Cameron Crowe balanced himself on the high wire between those extremes, while simultaneously juggling the 429 cultural references and the multiple levels of reality. Where most directors would just take on one story arc, Crowe goes for about 4. Boy meets his reflection in the mirror, boy loses his reflection, boy tries to get his perfect reflection back, boy gets his reflection back--or does he? And it all unravels (or does it?).

Tom Cruise and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz had all the chemistry that Cruise lacked with his then real life wife Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. Cruz was magical and Cruise gave a stellar performance. He almost jumps on the couch on Oprah, but dials it back just enough. It was a bold performance, as in the first part he is kind of a jerk, but semi likeable, considering he has had the world handed to him on a silver platter. In the next part he has to adjust to life without his movie star smile. His face is hideously disfigured. He doesn't take it well, and is an even bigger jerk. I think this was brave and one of Tom Cruise's boldest roles. He is forced to actually act here, and not just smile and let the audience bask in his smile. He is not just cruising on auto pilot. Though Pen&eacute;lope Cruz obviously makes his job so much easier.

Cameran Diaz did well as the F W/ B, or the FB for short (See Comment). She seems like she is content with the friendship with benefits, but then she lowers the boom! Big Time. Rumor has it that the character called Kelly from Lost in Translation was based on Miss Diaz. Writer/director Sofia Copolla's husband Spike Jonze directed Cameran in Being John Malkovich (again, see comment). Sofia/Sofia, Cameron/Cameran, Cruise/Cruz? I don't know what any of that means, but there's something about Diaz, ""the saddest girl to ever hold a martini.""

Jason Lee plays David's wing man Brian, an aspiring writer. What is it with Jason Lee's movie career? He is the perennial 2nd banana (Heartbreakers being the exception that proves the rule). Lee was 2nd banana to Ben Affleck in Chasing Amy (who is himself the perennial 2nd banana to Matt Damon). 2nd banana to David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool, even, where his character is also a writer, just like in Vanilla Sky. It's one thing to play 2nd banana to Tom Cruise, but once you have 2nd bananaed Schwimmer, you better take that offer to be on a sit com about karma called ""My Name is Earl,"" because your movie career is in what is known in show biz as a rut.

Jason Lee was also a rock singer in Cameron Crowe's previous film, Almost Famous, but he was kind of a 2nd banana there, too. He was the Greg Almon to Billy Crudup's Duane Almon, so even though he was the lead singer, he was upstaged by the guitarist, and thus was also the 2nd banana, again. 3rd banana, if you count the kid who was supposed to be the young Cameron Crowe. Jason Lee was more than adequate as Cruise's 2nd banana here, but nothing to write home about.

The film also features the talents of Timothy Spall, Johnny Gallecki, Alicia Witt, Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor, and Tilda Swinton; and a great soundtrack, with well chosen tunes from Radiohead, The Rolling Stones, Todd Rundgren, The Beach Boys, a 3D hologram of John Coltrane, Creeper Lagoon, The Monkees, R.E.M., Elmer Bernstein, Jeff Buckley, Bob Dylan, Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor, Bj&ouml;rk; and Paul McCartney even recorded a song called Vanilla Sky especially for this film. The songs, an integral part of the 429 cultural references, are woven seamlessly into the tapestry of Vanilla Sky.

1436667,5,B00005JKMY,"Cameron Crowe was known for sweet natured films, so seeing ""Vanilla Sky"" was a refreshing escape from his norm. Strange and compelling, it's  about a guy who's privileged and set in his ways. Suddenly, things change and he doesn't know what's going on. I didn't really know what was going on either, but it was too compelling to take my eyes away. The catharsis at the end was worth the wait. Fine acting from all, especially Cruise and Jason Lee. Cameron Diaz was deservedly nominated for many awards (SAG, etc), and I take issue with Penelope Cruz' nom from the Razzies. She was charming and totally in touch with the material. The DVD has loads of extras; the story makes sense if you can make it through the middle section, which goes off in many directions.  This is an American remake of an Amenabar film, in which Ms Cruz appeared. Critics are wrong, on so many levels. It's definitely worth a look.",1270512000,,906,4.58641975308642

I bought this DVD cheaper than I could have rented it for one night. I can't remember exactly how much I paid for it but it was around $2 or $2.50 but no more plus around $3 shipping and handing.

The only positive value of the film is it passes time well there are several cuties in it among which are Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz. Kurt Russell does some good acting on his part.

This movie is formula and predictable.  Formula as many variations of this are overused such as in ""The Matrix.""  There is no mask or detraction as to what they are trying to do.
The bulk of the movie is disjointed Sound Bites, and flashbacks (or forwards or whatever.)

Bottom line, it is a take it or leave it film that passes time.",1265328000,,733,4.6434108527131785
1436730,2,B00005JKMY,"One of the first things you'll notice about `Vanilla Sky' is that it is a very visual piece.  From the opening canvas of empty streets, `Vanilla Sky' is almost too beautifully crafted.  It is within this visual mask that we are expected to completely fall, and thus we lose sight of the fact that this film really doesn't do much more.

Seriously, it's pretty but is there really anything else that can be said for it?

The film tells a very familiar tale (or at least `morally') about a man who has everything (or so it appears) because of his dashing good looks and his endless supply of wealth only to have it taken all away by a jealous lover who despises him because of his despicable personality.  Sadly, this tragic intervention (his lover drives him, literally, into the hospital) comes at the precise moment when this devilishly self-absorbed creep falls madly in love with a mysterious woman who offers him the opportunity (and motivation) to become a better man.

If you feel the above paragraph is clich ridden and rather generic, you'd be correct.

The best thing I can say about `Vanilla Sky' is that Crowe paints with such an expansive and stirring paintbrush that we never really realize how dense and contrived the film really is.  We do get wrapped up in the splendor of his `vision' to the point where the films ridiculousness (and rather clumsy and chaotic plot twists) doesn't really hit us.  Maybe that should be considered praise, since Cameron Crowe made something stupid appear poignant and `deep', but I don't know if I can praise it.

It's like putting lipstick on a pig; right?

That was rather harsh, I know, but further reflection on this film has really embittered me, because I was so duped by Crowe's directorial achievements (you can't really say this was a good directorial job either, when you consider some of the performances).

Tom Cruise is a generic and fictitious representation of what we all have probably come to consider his real self.  He is flamboyant and self concerned and borderline insane.  Penelope Cruz may have ended this decade on a very high note (her performances post 06 have been stellar) but she started this decade horrifically.  Is it just me, or has she even gotten prettier over the decade?  I really thought that she was a talentless and extremely unattractive woman until I saw `Volver'.  She is bland and ineffective here.  Jason Lee can't do drama well at all.  It is apparent here.  The whole `Kurt Russell plot point' is just the worst part of the film for me, even if his performance is effective and sound.

CAMERON DIAZ.

That is all I need to say here.  I mean, she is the only reason to see this movie, and the only reason I will recommend this movie, beings that her performance is so stellar and so superb and so masterful and seriously one of the best supporting turns of the decade.  The way she handles Julie's instability and ruthless jealousy (and bitter emotional devastation) is just so impressive I can't help but bow at just the thought of her flirtatious and manic threats.

YOU CANNOT STOP LOOKING AT HER.

Upon distanced reflection it becomes obvious that `Vanilla Sky' is just not the film it is pretending to be.  You want to like it, love it even, because it is visually stirring, which gives the impression that there is something there to be seen.  The prolific (or faux prolific) statements made with the delicately disguised sets are not enough to make this a good film.

Cameron Diaz is enough to make me recommend this very poor movie though.",1263254400,3,3541,4.684466019417476

Perhaps opinion in this, as with most everyhting, will inevitably depend upon the person giving it, but still, I don't agree with this sentiment at all.

Sure, there are some idiosyncrosies in Crowe's style, but all in all, Vanilla Sky came across as a much more well pieced together story than Ojos, from character development (including Cruz's), scripting, the matter of piecing together the bits and pieces that comprise the timeline of the movie, and in the acting (I particularly felt Cruise did much better than his counterpart).  I believe the real selling point for myself in choosing VS over Ojos is simply that it goes more deeply into the themes carrying the story to its closing, ie, some of the observations of the manner in how the actions/attitudes we carry on in our day to day lives can be so affecting (ironic, however, that Cruise's involvement with Cruz while creating this film led to the dissolution of his marriage).

At its core, the film is a classic tale of redemption with some sci-fi elements tossed in to add to the flavor. At times it is shocking and violent, at others schmaltzy or vulgar, and the characters can come off as vapid urbanites who have never even had to think about working a normal job. Still, the film manages to connect emotionally on many levels despite the fact that it's hard to identify with the characters.

Perhaps the film could have accomplished its task without coming off as pretentious, but somehow I doubt it. This is one of my favorite films, and one I've shared with many friends.

I simply loved every twist and turn of this film.

This film, I believe, marks a departure for Cameron Crowe's film making. You will quickly see that this film is not as focused on the MTV generation, generation X or music in general. So the story goes, he became infatuated with the whole concept of Abre Los Ojos (the original Spanish film)that he felt as though he must try it himself. Cruise is the lead and I realized it in this film that he really is an odd actor.  His acting seems so very fake and over-the-top, yet at the same time, poignantly real. I do like him for this. Cruz and Diaz are wonderful. Cruz we knew she was this kind of an actor, but Diaz surprised me with a different performance than her usual.

1436795,2,B00005JKMY,"A film which makes an attempt to pattern itself on the fantasy vs. reality films that had become popular at the turn of the new millennium - David Fichner's ""Fight Club"" and M. Night Shamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" both from 1999, Christopher Nolan's ""Momento"" from 2000, and David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" released the following year (all of which don't surpass the reigning king of this genre when Terry Gilliam released his 1985 masterpiece ""Brazil"") - by no means fails in this respect since I found it both entertaining and intriguing for the most part, but is noticeably long and certainly may confuse the average '2hr-max-movie-goer'. Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both stand out playing their respective, 'good gal/bad gal roles and Jason Lee is quite appealing as the best friend of our dashing lead Tom Cruise. Yet Cruise may be viewed as stretching this performance given the physical challenges that are demanded. I hesitate to reveal these challenges to those that have not seen the picture as they are indeed the focal point of the plot. Many good things like the witty Cameron Crowe retrospective soundtrack that is weaved into clever culture references and tributes which are indeed enjoyable and even necessary to solve the riddle presented in 'what's is going on?' scenario of the main character's pressing dilemma which may not be easy to access with a single viewing. But still the ride can be entertaining as Tom runs away and into trouble as he often does in quasi-action films that are laced with mystery and intrigue like Sydney Pollack's 1993 ""The Firm"", Brian De Palma's 1996 ""Mission Impossible"" and even the more cerebrally dark, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" from Stanley Kubrick. As noted by many educated critics as well as the tasteless tabloids Mr. Cruise may be biting off more than he can chew as he dives into the land of independent production. I applaud Tom for his efforts and are rooting for his success yet do believe that his choice for future roles should include a return to comedic territory as a deviation/diversion to selecting elaborate/complicated efforts which could be prove too risky and result in a poor reception at the box office.",1197158400,3,2168,4.958791208791209

It's definitively worth watching at least once in your life and it's not a bad movie to own. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because some narrated parts could have been done better.

I felt sympathy for David (Cruise), maybe I even felt a little bit identified with him. I'm no Casanova and I certainly don't own an enterprise like David did, but we all have moments in our life where we make small ""harmless"" choices that change our life forever.

1436870,5,B00005JKMY,"So I sat down to give Vanilla Sky a viewing, without reading much about it and just hoping it was even mildly interesting and thought-provoking. It turned out to be a well made movie, with some good performances, and decently thought-provoking as well!

Tom plays a wealthy playboy heir with one of his big hobbies being to get laid all the time and then cast the women aside when he gets bored of them. One day he appears to have broken one heart too many and his life is changed forever. He ends up in an accident, disfigured, in excruciating pain. He thinks the board of directors is out to steal his inherited company. Him and his friend have fallen for the same woman and he thinks he'll lose her because of his problems now. And from there it's down the rabbit hole... some force in his mind is degenerating... his dreams become nightmares and he can't tell what sanity is. Kurt Russell plays a psychologist who tries to coax it out of him and solve a crime.

That's about as far as I can go without explaining the truth of the plot revealed at the end. Suffice to say, it's something out of left field. I thought Cruise, while being his usual androidal self that does a good job at least of pretending to be human, did a capable job and the rest of cast are even better. Even Cameron Diaz had an effective scene which is remarkable. Penlope Cruz does the best job though, lighting up a relationship triangle with her humor and naturalness.

I'll have to see the original some time since it seems by a lot of consensus, Cruise took some rather crude liberties with the film. However, watching it as I did, without any of that in mind, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.",1186272000,3,1682,4.36741214057508

1436874,4,B00005JKMY,"Spoiler Alert: Skip this review if you don't want to know the ending.

Cruise's rich, handsome and happily shallow character has bought himself a custom-made Heaven. This heaven comes complete with his favorite sky, a vanilla-colored sky patterned after his late mother's Monet painting. The catch is that he doesn't know he's dreaming and that his peculiar heaven will eventually turn hellish. In fact, after 150 years of dreaming of the bliss of finding and winning his dearest and most true love Sofia, he first suspects and then rages that it's not real at all, but a nightmare. Strands of Hindu mysticism are subtly woven through this film, hinting of something beautifully infinite and strange. The movie's soundtrack heightens the mood and mind-bending confusion of this film, and it may turn the screws to your mind at times, leaving you spinning and feeling off center. If you don't understand the bad and the good vibrations that flow through this film, then--to paraphrase Penelope Cruz's character--maybe you will in another lifetime, when you are a cat.
In summary, I think this movie is worth watching more than once; so go ahead and get the DVD. There are many things to admire about it. For me, the romantic idea of being blissfully and timelessly sustained in a dream about finding one's true love is sweeter than a vanilla sky.",1171756800,2,1345,4.92511013215859
1436875,5,B00005JKMY,"Based upon a foreign film that translates into English as OPEN YOUR EYES (ABRE LOS OJOS), VANILLA SKY gets its title from a Claude Monet painting, ""Seine at Argenteuil"" that the film's protagonist, David Aames (Tom Cruise) has upon a wall.  The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ""Vanilla Sky"" because of the color that Monet used for the sky in the painting.  The misnomer of the painting's title is a key in understanding and appreciating the film because early on it becomes clear that this is a movie that likes to play with one's mind and the things that take place aren't necessarily real.

VANILLA SKY revolves around the character of David Aames.  David is the son and heir of a international media tycoon.  Most everyone close to him, including his best friend Brain Shelby (Jason Lee) see David as a spoiled brat who has no appreciation whatsoever for all the gifts that have been given to him since birth.  He takes advantage of almost everyone he meets and lives in a fantasy world of wine, women, and song.  At the start of the film David is involved in a serious relationship with a beautiful blonde named Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz).  They have been dating for sometime and are romantically linked, but David doesn't feel their relationship is as serious as Julie does.  Whereas Julie is waiting for David to commit and propose, David sees her as simply being a ""friend with benefits.""

At his birthday party, David meets a woman that he finds so captivating and fascinating that he falls immediately in love with her.  The woman, Sophia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) is the opposite of everything that he found attractive in Julie.  David ends up walking her back to her place and spends the night talking with her.  To him, Sophia is the woman of his dreams.  She is the woman he would choose to marry.  Unfortunately for David, Julie doesn't take things very well.  She reminds him of some of the unavoidable truths about their relationship.  Julie and David are involved in a car crash and when he opens his eyes, he is living in a different world.

His face has been reconstructed and at first things seem normal.  But then David starts having nightmares.  Soon the nightmares of his dreams seem to mix with his day to day life.  He finds himself unable to distinguish the difference.  Sophia is Julie and Julie is Sophia.  The world is too confusing and David longs to sleep so that he can return to his dreams.  Pleasant, pleasant dreams filled with the Sophia he met at the party and skies colored in vanilla.

I really don't like Tom Cruise much.  He does have talent, but his large ego and cocky attitude take away from every picture I've ever seen him act in.  Therefore, I was reluctant to see VANILLA SKY.  I wish I would have watched the movie long ago.

The movie is a strange romantic drama sci-fi picture that tackles some huge issues.  How do we live our lives?  Would you rather live your life in a comfortable existence filled with superficial happiness or would you rather live an exciting, though often painful life filled with wonder and awe, truth and beauty, but only occasional moments of happiness?  This is a decision that each one of us is actually presented with daily. We might not always recognize it as such, but it is and the way that choice is presented in the film makes VANILLA SKY such a powerful and engaging piece of cinema.

Cruise's ego works well for most of the film, though it denies the audience from completely identifying and empathizing with the plight of David Aames.  Cruise is a great jerk, but not a very good reformed man.  However, his gift at playing spoiled id-driven men sucks the audience into the action of VANILLA SKY from the beginning and even though one is never convinced of David's reformation, Cruise's performance/presence keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.  Penelope Cruz reminds me of a Spanish Audrey Hepburn and though she isn't in the movie a great deal, she shines in the moments that she is.  Cameron Diaz is a beauty and movie star, but overcomes her celebrity. She does a wonderful job of portraying Julie, an everywoman character that many women who have been stepped upon by men can relate to.  Julie isn't on screen very long either, but when she is she raises some important questions about love, relationships, and sex in American society.  Another important actor in the film is Jason Lee.  Lee portrays David's best friend Brian, who is busy writing a novel.  Brian is the catalyst for many of the film's deeper thought-provoking moments.  It is also Brian who just might hold the key to the real meaning of the film.  Like Cruise, sometimes having Lee in a picture is a turnoff, however in VANILLA SKY he is perfectly cast.

VANILLA SKY isn't the easiest film to understand.  It isn't necessarily the most romantic film and though it's an intelligent movie, it asks more questions than it answers.  It also has an open ending, so people who have to have a movie end all tidy will have problems with the film's ending.  Nevertheless, the film is a beautiful piece of cinema that engages and entertains.  A person cannot watch it without and not have something to think about later.  That's something only really good movies can do.",1170892800,19,5250,4.685245901639345
1436876,1,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is quite a disappointment considering the presence of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Penelope Cruz, among others!

The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond ""below average!""

Tom Cruise and the rest of this AMAZING cast are given terrible lines and bad roles.  A shame, really...

The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words...

As for the plot, school plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better storylines!  It is truly sad...

It seems as though the writers/directors/producers decided to go artsy-fartsy on us, following in the dreaded footsteps of other such ""films"" as It's All About Love and the Russian Ark.

So it's a weak plot, and a GREAT-but-wasted cast and setting, which when put together fail to take off.  No masterpiece here.",1154563200,5,855,5.093525179856115
1436877,4,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is either a disappointment when viewed against Indie Film standards, or a happily confusing lark when compared to the unending deluge of big budget / low-minded Hollywood that's released weekly.

On the plus side, we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind. A movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting, it is that rare commodity: the movie we like to talk about later. Like Memento or Barton Fink, people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it's over.

Also impressive is the fact that Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's famed pretty boys, spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask, or horribly disfigured. Not a role many other actors would jump to take.

On the down side, Vanilla Sky, (a re-make ?) is basically an Art House or Indie film starring a big Hollywood actor. What could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man, or alternate/multiple realities, or even a study on the nature of reality itself, instead ends up like an art house rip-off of Total Recall.

Rating: B- / C+

FYI:

1) When did the universe change so much that ""Banky"" from Chasing Amy could get a lead role playing opposite Tom Cruise?

2) When did Penelope Cruz get the role of Indecipherable Speaker, ala Brad Pitt in Snatch or Fenster in The Usual Suspects?

Firstly I'd just like to say don't believe the critics and see the original version of this film. This version is by far the better of the two. It irritates me when people just say the original is better to appear intellectual. As if it's cooler to say the original will always be the best. Critics like to pick holes in any remake with be name actors and actresses. However, this is an excellent example of superior directing, acting, writing, screenplay etc. . .

Never has a film been so complimented by its music. You can tell that much thought has gone into the songs chosen and it works incredibly well. You can tell that each song means something to the film makers involved and most probably to you also. You will find yourself pausing the credits to write down a big list of albums to get the next time you go music shopping.

That's all I wanted to say.

1436957,5,B00005JKMY,"David (Cruise) is a vain self loving man who takes for granted everything that he has.  He's never worked for anything but had everything handed to him by those around him.  Even his on-again-off-again F@#$-buddy Julie (Diaz) gives him everything she can regandless of how he treats her.  His best friend played by Jason Lee is a loyal friend dispite the fact that David disregards his feelings on the drop of a dime, even going as far as to take the one woman that his friend really ""digs""...that woman being the exotic Sofia (Cruz), a guest at his birthday party, a guest that his Jason Lee brings as a date but she ends up taking David home.  At this point of the film you really dislike this guy.  He rich, good looking and pretty much better than everyone else, and he knows it, so he flaunts it.  Then the morning comes, and with the sun comes a gloomy day, a very gloomy day.  Julie meets David outside Sofia's apartment and confronts him about his feelings for Sofia.  She tells him she loves him and that she needs him and then...BAM! she drives him off a bridge and into a wall and here is where you need to open your eyes!  From that point on the film spirals down towards an ending that wil have you guessing.  From the murder charge he can't explain nor understand to the life he can't be living and the dreams/nightmares that he is having and theres this guy that keeps showing up in bars and clubs and he's almost everywhere that David turns.  WHO IS THIS MAN?  Open your eyes...you'll see him very soon.  The acting is superb on the parts of the lesser players.  Diaz gives an oscar worthy performance as proven by her SAG nomination for the part and Jason Lee as the loyal yet betrayed best friend and even Kurt Russell as his shrink trying to understand the mess he's in does a great job.  The movie will have you guessing and it may even take 2 or 3 watches to fully get what's going on but it's well worth the time spent.  Great concept for a film and I hear it's a remake of a film starring Penelope Cruz called 'Open your Eyes'...can't judge between the two beings that I've never seen the first one but from the other reviews I gather that this version is the better of the 2...Watch it and love it and remember to open your eyes...the answers are right in front of you...literally!",1137456000,6,2305,4.3629976580796255

If you have an open mind when it comes to movies, then you might like it a lot.  The negative reviews about the film seem to be because the reviewer didn't understand the film, and therefore was frustrated into attacking it.  I love how people who don't get a movie say that the people who think highly of it are ""acting smart"" just because they think it makes them smart to like a particular film.  It has nothing to do with intelligence in my view.  All it is to me is perception.  So if you like films with a science fiction flavor and you're open minded, then this is a five-star film.  If not, don't waste your time with this one.  You'd be better off going to see a movie that spells out every aspect of it's essence with perfect clarity.

1437000,5,B00005JKMY,"I've watched many films - some are just disgarded as a waste of time. Others are thoughtful and remain in the memory for some time. And some a very good. Vanilla Sky is the best film I have ever seen. The only film that has actually affected how I live life. I saw the film in the cinema and I thought I liked it but I wasn't 100% sure because I didn't understand it fully. I watched it again and again (probably about 12 times now) and each time it just seemed to get better.

The film probably has it's flaws. But these are so outweighed by the plusses that I can't see them.

The soundtrack of the film is incredible. I'm not referring to the actual commercial CD of the soundtrack because I believe that more than half of the films tracks are not on the CD. I instantly took to the Sigur ros song that was played when David jumped off the rooftop at the end. I then heard it on the radio on night and decided that I had to get that tune. It took a few hours to track it down using the internet, but I learned all about Sigur Ros in the process. I bought their records and they are now by far my favourite band.

Anyway, the film itself has so many emotions and themes running through it that you identify with some of it. Obviously not the sci-fi part.

Temptation/Consequences - It's human nature to be tempted into wronful actions. How many times have we ruined love and friendship by wrong deeds. The lead character was revitalised after leaving Sofias house in the morning. He could have lived another 40 years in happiness and true love. But he got in the car and his life was ruined. On a personal note, I've done stupid things which nearly ruined the best relationship of my life. This film has made me really think.

Love - We don't appreciate love till something goes wrong

Anybody who can't understand the film should watch it again. Even a third time. That's when it all falls into place.

As for the reviewer who posted on 2 Jan 2006, he thinks Far and

Away was a good movie and doesn't like ""hard to follow"" movies.

Go rent a bunch of cartoons if you want to be entertained!! Don't dismiss a good film cause you don't understand it.",1136332800,7,2152,4.267813267813268

Then on top of this, the story is a mind bender only to conceal the ending. They try to keep you guessing till the end where you will be completely let down by the lame ending. The only scene worth wathcing in this whole movie is when they get in that car crash, but that was probably only worth seeing in the movie theater with the great sound and big screen. You couldn't pay me to see another Tom Cruise movie after his long string of wierd movies. To top it off the guy has been rated as the most annoying actor of 2005. I think its affecting the movies.",1136160000,3,718,4.099290780141844
1437002,5,B00005JKMY,"There's a lot of reasons why somebody would want you to believe this is a bad movie.

""The movies disguises confusion as deep plot"" is a common one.

This movie is an amazing cinematic experience. For the people who said ""poorly developed plot, specifically between Cruise & Cruz,"" well, the answer for that is in the last few minutes! The movie is AWARE of that fact and also gives you the reason! This movie is not one for casual viewing: it demands that you pay attention to every scene, the dialogues as well as the on-screen visuals. You can't just take a 40-second run to the fridge while the movie is running...a masterfully told story, with great music and greater lines.

SPOILER (SORT OF)

David Aames isn't exactly the kind of guy Average Joe Six-Pack can associate with: he's rich, better looking than 99% of us, sleeps with women who are about 10 times hotter than the ones we sleep with, lives life king size and doesn't even work (sort of). But even this flamboyant-sexy-rich hunk ends up making that one mistake that we all have committed at least once when we were younger: concocting an imaginary fairytale romance with somebody we love (read fascinated/obsessed with) so strongly for reasons unknown that in our little imaginary world, she's the perfect woman, who loves our jokes, loves us regardless of anything else, doesn't seem to care about money and is just too damn sweet. We barely know these girls/women, maybe engage in 3-minute conversations a few times a week at the water cooler and flash each other bright smiles down the hallway. It doesn't qualify for any kind of relationship (maybe except that guy/gal from work/school)...but in our young, love-lusting minds, they are the perfect saviours for our lovelorn lives. This is the essence of this movie...one that causes me to identify with Tom Cruise's character in the movie (yeah, even I was 17 once). But this movie, takes that 17-year-old-romance factor and makes it believable when it afflicts Tom Cruise. That, is an achievement in great storytelling.

I haven't seen the original and I'm sure it must be a good movie...but I still wonder if it can top the Cruise/Crowe experience.

Excellent choice for repeat viewings (in the same category as Terminator 2: Judgement Day. At least I can't seem to tire of these two...surprisingly, I no longer feel like sitting through The Matrix that frequently!)

P.S. You must really love this movie if you understand the title. I realized it after the 10th time (or something) I saw it. Its the scene, the morning-after the nightclub scene. It's shown twice in the movie - Halfway through and at the very end. Well, just observe the sky and notice what the reason for that Vanilla Sky is!",1135814400,4,2717,4.805139186295503
1437003,4,B00005JKMY,"Director:  Cameron Crowe

Cast:  Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, Noah Taylor, Timothy Spall, Tilda Swinton, Michael Shannon.

Running Time:  136 minutes

Rated R for sexuality and strong language.

""Almost Famous"" was Cameron Crowe's deeply felt ode to rock and roll, a personal journey that was one of the most highly acclaimed films of 2000. In keeping with the rock theme, ""Vanilla Sky"" could be considered Crowe's cover version of the Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 mind-bender ""Open Your Eyes."" Reteaming with his ""Jerry Maguire"" star Tom Cruise, Crowe has taken the lukewarm original vision and twisted it in to a thoroughly bizarre, yet unmercifully enthralling picture.  David Aames (Tom Cruise) is an unapologetic, filthy rich playboy who heads a publishing empire and enjoys life to the fullest. At his birthday party, David, through his best friend Brian (Jason Lee), meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz). The two have instant chemistry, and David begins to have real feelings of love for her, something which angers Julie (Cameron Diaz), an old flame. Julie invites David into her car for a ride one afternoon, and promptly crashes it, killing her and disfiguring David. Dazed and confused, David must learn to live again with his disfigurement, and also confront his reality. A reality that is quickly spinning out of his control and heading toward dementia.

Written and directed by Crowe, ""Vanilla Sky"" is about as extreme a left turn as a filmmaker can make these days and he creates an extending, hallucinogenic film that succeeds only because Crowe is taking such a leap of faith.  The higher aspirations for ""Vanilla Sky"" set Crowe's imagination afire. Taking on bigger topics such as the media-suffocating world and the true consequences of casual sex, Crowe's loftier ambitions with ""Vanilla Sky"" are miles away from his usual territory of optimism and love. It's a change that I wasn't comfortable with at first, but soon realized that this stretching of the artistic muscles seems to suit Crowe. A director with an incredible gift for visuals (the opening scene set in a completely abandoned Times Square is a knockout) and music placement (Crowe even includes a long forgotten Monkees tune ""The Porpoise Song"" in his kaleidoscope of a soundtrack), Crowe takes the audience on a journey of multiple realities this time out. A place where all might not be as it seems. Dangerous, even for a man who once asked Eddie Vedder to act, but the new direction opens Crowe up in an all new light. Though I would be disappointed if he completely dropped his heartfelt stories that shaped the foundation of his career, I can rest assured that he can hold his own with even the most peculiar of stories.

Enlisting Tom Cruise into the fold is a stroke of genius, since the actor seems to be the most comfortable under Crowe's direction. ""Vanilla Sky"" asks a lot of Cruise. It forces him to act with heavy prosthetics for the first time in his career and the character also confronts the very golden boy image that Cruise spent the better part of the last decade trying to bury six feet under. Hyper, convincing, and brutally committed, Cruise takes the challenge of ""Vanilla Sky"" very seriously. He comes away with an enriching performance that rivals the best work of his career. It helps to have great backup as well from actors the likes of Lee, Cruz, Diaz, Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor and Timothy Spall. It may seem from the opening that this is a no-brainer role for Cruise. Just wait. As the narrative mire becomes deeper, the intensity of his performance grows with each passing minute.  While it is a remake (and a pretty straight one at that), ""Vanilla Sky"" does have many hurdles to cross that Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"" didn't even need to consider. With a bigger star and a budget roughly 60 times larger, Crowe and Cruise have to be very careful to make sure the audience doesn't begin to lose interest in the jigsaw puzzle story. They clarify the plot more efficiently than Amenabar did, and they don't leave the public cold in the end as the original did. ""Open Your Eyes"" was a scrappier, less involving yarn, as it had less at stake, and that was the very reason I didn't respond to it. ""Vanilla Sky"" is more urgent with its drama, more interested in keeping the story moving and not relying on the third act twist which propels this tale from being merely a brain-tickler to a full out acid trip. ""Sky"" is not an easy film to like, and for a big-budget holiday picture, seems and often acts as uncommercial as they come. Yet under all the deranged images, all the nightmare narrative and all the unsightly Tom Cruise, there is a motion picture that does the unthinkable. It is actually quite better than the film it's remaking.  To see growth in talent and audacity in project selection from Crowe is certainly a treat, for ""Vanilla Sky"" is a solid entry from the director and promises some more changes of pace in the future. As long as he continues to have his heart buried somewhere beneath all the madness, we have nothing to worry about.",1135814400,,5090,4.810068649885584

 ""Vanilla Sky is a tough film to rate. Too interesting to be called bad, too pretentious to be called good,"" says Gary Paton from the online Movie Gazette in his review.  Certainly, it was a stunning movie-at least with the first viewing.  Viewers are dazzled and confused with special effects, sketchy dialogue, and a summary that fell far short of the demands of the story.  Vanilla Sky was meant to function as a work of art, questioning the boundaries of dreams and reality, the wants and desires of our subconscious; but seemed to come second to its Hollywood duty: sensationalize.

 David Aames, played by Tom Cruise, begins as a narcissistic playboy and suddenly his life is scattered in the matter of a few hours.  He meets Sofia Serrano, realizes there is more to love than one-night stands, and nearly killed when his jealous friend, Julie, drives off a bridge.  The story begs to follow the path of redemption of David, but suddenly careens into a science fiction thriller.  The viewer is not given the chance nor time to understand the course of events:  the sudden appearance (and re-disappearance) of dead Julie, the reversion to his disfigured face, and many other apparently inexplicable, incongruent events.  The conclusion was lofty and dramatic, simply resolving David's character and leaving several gaping plot holes open for the viewer to fall into.

 Although Abre Los Ojos, the original Spanish film, had less character development it felt more natural and more meaningful than Vanilla Sky.  It is a film to enjoy only when one has plenty of time to absorb the deeper meanings beyond the time spent watching the film itself.",1133136000,2,1680,4.971326164874552
1437005,2,B00005JKMY,"""Open Your Eyes"" was much better than ""Vanilla Sky.""  ""Vanilla Sky"" mostly copied ""Open Your Eyes"" but was too obvious and less convincing.  (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.)  ""Open Your Eyes"" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where ""Vanilla Sky"" does.  Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in ""Vanilla Sky"" is poorly done, whereas ""Open Your Eyes"" represents the dream experience very well.  I recommend watching both movies before you buy one.  But if you're going to buy, get ""Open Your Eyes.""",1131494400,5,582,4.6568627450980395
1437006,5,B00005JKMY,"Very interesting film, the first part of this film is linear and logical and easy to watch, the second part (where everything goes apparently crazy) will unfortunately turn off most casual viewers (it did me - the first time). When the film is explained better (toward the end) and becomes a sci-fi movie is when we can appreciate all the 'muddled' elements (like the identity of his girlfriend changing every few minutes), it therefore pays to pay attention throughout the confusing parts and for this reason has the appeal of being very re-watchable.

The film grapples with some sad realities, firstly it deals with Cruises's mind's inability to construct a satisfying reality for him, nothing he can dream up can compare to reality, yes even with reality's dissapointments and bruises and pain - the thrill of exploring the unknowns of reality and the way they change us and shape us is incomparably better to living in a contained fantasy. The second is the theme of apparently unrequited love, Cruise's self pity and lack of confidence costs him a real chance at true love - at the end we see how he narrowly missed out on Cruz (who was just waiting for him to make a move).

The ending is....perfect, i must admit i was pleasantly shocked - it all makes sense, how Cruise swapped his vanilla sky for a Monet sky - at the very end as he is waking up he hears Cruz's voice, this possibly indicates that his escape to reality was probably another fantasy in itself, another trick by the designers to calm him down.

..This is a great movie for repeat viewings. It is a layered complex story that is as enjoyable watching with the Director's commentary as it is just enjoying the movie.

..The characters are beautiful ,the script is real and intelligent in terms of dialogue , and the message is life and love....

David Ames is a narcissistic man with all of life at his doorstep. He has the life we all want and then is turned upside down. The story itself is a blend of sci-fi and fantasy but the ultimate message in the end is one of appreciating all the little things and the joy of being in love with life and finding that someone who gets who you are.

The film is complex and bears repated viewings just to see all the ""clues"" that show you where it is going. It is a lovingly crafted movie that I would love to see a Director's cut of someday.

The soundtrack provides a moving score and is deftly synchronized with the tone of the movie. I just wihs the CD had all the music from the movie on it. I eneded up searching for some of the music here on this website. I recommend the DVD and the CD whole heartedly.

1437008,5,B00005JKMY,"It has always disturbed me that this wonderful film didn't recieve the praise it deserved from audiences or critics.  On the other hand, it must be said that sometimes what makes a movie all the more one's own is knowing how groundbreaking it is and that with time others will realize the same.  In a country that typically favors thin story/big action (a la ID4 or Blade), Vanilla Sky is the absolute antithesis.

Cameron Crowe's superb genre-twisting thriller is one of the most intricately woven and ultimately satisfying I've ever seen.  Every element- from the script to the sound to the editing to the acting -is top notch.

A man in a facial prosthetic gives the account of the last few months of his life to a psychiatrist from a prison cell.  He had run a national publishing company, was filthy rich, had glamorous parties with beautiful women, a loyal best friend, and then met the love of his life...So how did he end up here and why? There is no emotion you'll cease to feel and no genre that goes unrepresented. There is love, fear, confusion, awe, humor, exhilaration,  and gratification.  All perfectly timed and executed to maximum impact.

Though it may be natural to want to compare Vanilla Sky to Open Your Eyes, don't bother.  Appreciate this masterpiece for what it is.  Pay attention to the details and you'll leave the film feeling enlightened and nostalgic.

1437082,3,B00005JKMY,"This film stars Tom Cruise.

Sadly, that statement condemns the watcher to over two hours of flat characterisation, empty purpose and hollow feelings.  Tom Cruise plays himself admirably.  He dare attempt no other role.  The casting deprives a powerful story of its fundamental strength.  The perceptive viewer will quickly realise that this plot is rich with promise, a covenant emptied of its worth by the inadequacy of its lead actor.  The story, opening with the hackneyed depiction of sex, money and power, soon enters a new realm of fantasy.  The issue of ""what is real?"", reduced to a trance state from overuse, is here granted a fine resurrection.  The surprise is its mechanism.

The story of a ""poor little rich kid"" seems, initially, too weary to endure again.  Inheriting a publishing house, a New York apartment and a resentment toward his departed father, David Ames has no aims.  His sole relationship with the company is an ongoing battle with the Board of Directors for control.  The control isn't rooted in how the business is run - it seems to run itself.  It's a personality clash - with seven people collectively having less personality than Cruise.  How is that possible?  David has a stable of ready women, as any rich pretty boy should.  Notable among them is Julie - Cameron Diaz, whose sensuality is somehow actually enhanced in this film.  How is that possible?  David has another stable - his friends.  This one contains but one resident - a stereotype struggling writer doing a fictional autobiography.  Which is possible to the point of saturation.

This scenario promises the ennui of a George Sanders film until David encounters Sofia.  Played by Penelope Cruz, Sofia vacillates between repelling David's advances and enticing him on.  The first encounter lasts the entire night.  David emerges from Sofia's apartment to be confronted by Julie.  The result of this encounter initiates the film's departure from stereotype.  Julie, challenging David's flighty notions of committment, leads them to an act of mutual destruction.  Or does it?  Something goes awry and David is being interviewed by a psychiatrist.  This interaction becomes the basis of the story as David struggles to detail the events of his life leading to horrible disfigurement, emotional conflicts over his women, his friend and his inheritance.  David may have murdered somebody, but the victim isn't identified and the circumstances defy definition.  The resolution shows why this film could have been a masterpiece.  Crowe's struggles to retain the power of the original story are Herculean, but simply undercut by Cruise's insistence on playing the lead.  I would have preferred George Sanders.

There is evidence of Crowe's abilities in the other roles.  Cameron Diaz brings a fresh intensity to her depiction of the rejected suitor.  She's not just a gold-seeker - David is a real person to her [obviously surpassing our perception].  Penelope Cruz possesses all the grace and dignity you would expect of a ballerina.  She handles every scene with finesse.  The real standout here is Kurt Russell as the psychologist.  In their exchanges, Russell is drawn in by both David's personality and the bizarre condition he suffers - the wearing of a latex face mask to conceal his scars.  It's tempting to say Cruise is at his best behind a mask, but we'll forebear.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1127088000,14,3404,5.0703971119133575

The journey he has after the car crash is what the film is all about. I did feel sympathy for him. Even when he was behaving very badly. Yes he behaved badly when he got in the car of his ex-lover but people do not change overnight.

Julie died but David is now severely disfigured and then he cant remember much of anything suddenly hes in weird phases of his life its like the whole thing is a dream suddenly he finds out some dark secrets that happened after that day.

The way that the ""friend"" reacted at the party when his date became star-struck with Cruise's character(her ignoring the date), was just shallow.

Vanilla Sky is one of those movies that will take your head, spin it around a couple of a thousand times and drop it so hard you won't know what happened! With that in mind, don't expect to understand the plot to Sky from the first viewing. Give it some time and repeated viewing and once you understand exactly what happens, write a detailed review here on Amazon!

The movie starts out normal with Cruise's character, a young, spoiled huge corporation inheritor and owner named David Aames waking up to his playboy get-what-I-want life. He wakes up the first time in a dream that reveals his fear of loneliness. Anybody with so much money and prestige cannot be alone, that's what we learn from the first ten minutes. David's life is also quite eccentric; he has a sex buddy, a singer named Julie Gianni played by Diaz but he takes her unseriously while he begins flirting and falling for the spanish companion of his best friend Brian, Jason Lee, Sofia played by Cruz. Gianni goes over the edge with David's carefree and neglectant behavior towards her true love for him, gives him a ride in her car and plunges to her death (or is it their death?)

From this scene on, David finds himself stuck in one dream (or is it not) sequence to another. His fears of loneliness come true (or don't they?) as his face becomes deconstructed due to the near fatal crash, and he's on a drunken spree to try to bring back Sofia into his life while struggling to maintain his playboy-ish and prestigious image.

The movie is nice to watch while Crowes' now brilliant script writing doesn't fail you with his charming dialogue, funny moments, and a string of classic rock tunes to the soundtrack, including the new song by Paul McCartney with the same title.

The movie's special features include a shot by shot commentary by Cameron Crowe. I do recommend listening to him talk about the ending of the movie to help you get your final understanding of the movie in general.

1437110,4,B00005JKMY,"It is very difficult to write this review without giving spoilers but I really enjoyed this movie.  It is one of those types where you are not sure what is real and want is in Tom Cruise's mind.

Cruise is in some type of correctional facility telling his story to Kurt Russell who appears to be a psychiatrist for his defense in a crime.  Cruise is wearing a mask and you suspect that he may be somehow disfigured under it.  Cruise tells how he was the major shareholder of a corporation and he had his disagreements with the board.  He also seems to have a lot of vivid dreams.

He also, tells about his relationships with Camaron Diaz and Penelope Cruz.  He gets into a car accident with Diaz and she dies.  The rest of the time you don't know what is real, what is a dream, or maybe in Cruz's mind.

Diaz and Cruz are both gorgeous and the movie held me from start to finish!",1120176000,,879,4.2155688622754495
1437111,4,B00005JKMY,"I saw this film last night and what had kept me away from this movie is the same thing that made me watch it. That thing is the negative reviews from friends,internet,media as such. Alright, so it isn't a film for everyone. I don't expect fourteen year olds to like it.

Where this film truly owns is the story line and the execution. I wouldnt think Tom would do a film like this. I was shocked to read towards the end that he was one of the producers. The director leaves absolutely nothing to predictability. There is a lot of suspense and confusion in the plot. I gotta feel it for the disfigured Tom Cruise. He's one fine actor and it's sadly plus interestingly real to know what a life it can be for someone who's had his face disfigured.

The film has many such dialogues and scenes that leave you smiling. The way Cruz jumps after her first liplocking session with TC,the Martini comment on Diaz,the bartender's ""B***h"",the bob dylan angle,the car crash,the best friend love triangle,the sex,the comment on a new birth as cats....

Alright. I won't go into any more details because that is not the purpose of my review. The purpose of my review is to tell you that any and most movie lovers would actually dig this. No , this isn't a romantic comedy. It's not a thriller. It's Vanilla Sky.

Who is this movie for?

This movie is for people who don't dismiss movies on the basis of conclusions but actually like the interesting things about the movie. Please note,anyone who liked the Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind , will like like this movie. I didn't like the movie as much I liked Vanilla Sky. It's done with a more ""we want your money,watcher"" theme.

Anyhow,WATCH THIS MOVIE for the love of originality.

Also,it has the best soundtrack any movie can have.

With much muted respect for originality,

1437113,3,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is an interesting remake of Abre los ojos. I can't say that it's better though.

Tom cruise's acting is meh. Cameron Diaz is Meh. Penelope cruz did her role better in the original.

Overall the film seems to work better than the original in the music department. The scene where tom leaves penelope's apartment right before the car accident and you hear jeff buckley's last goodbye is simply irresistible!

Also the scene when tom walks into the club and you see people dancing to thievery corporation's Indra track is very cool.

And at the end when you hear Sigur ros is just unforgettable!

Other than that, the film is inferior to the original.

Perhaps it being set in NYC made it more appealing but whatever.",1115856000,2,726,4.677165354330708
1437114,5,B00005JKMY,"The first time I watched this film, I hated it, I didn't understand anything, I just wanted to lie back and understand whats going on as if I were watching 'Speed'.

After seeing 'Minority Report', I decided to give it another go, and this time really focus. I understood it this time round, and its quite mind twisting, but I did not enjoy it as much as 'Minority Report', I found myself trying way too hard to catch up on what the hell was going on with no real entertainment along the way. The movie was only 2 hours, but it felt like 3 hours.

This is also one of those films that you definitely see best the first time around, so you really have to focus, look and listen to everything. This is also Tom Cruise' best work.

Unlike 'Minority Report' you might be reluctant to watch it again or anytime soon unless you haven't understood the story, as it really is one of those movies where it gets really boring after the first go.

Don't let the trailer fool you, this is far from a simple love story. Plenty of twists and turns, its hard to catch up. It may not be very enjoyable, but its definitely worth watching and understanding atleast once.",1115856000,,1152,4.344186046511628
1437115,5,B00005JKMY,"This is the type of movie that you're likely either going to love or hate.  Whether you buy / watch this movie or not, I think it prudent to know this going in.  As for me, I fall into the category of those who love this film.

The story tells the tale of a wealthy man (Tom Cruise) who is put in the enviable position of having to choose between Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz (gosh, if only I were ""cursed"" with such a predicament!).  Sounds like a typical erotic thriller type of movie, right?  WRONG!

Instead of being another run-of-the-mill boy-must-choose type of flick, this one takes some delightful twists and turns that you will likely not see coming.  There are some hints here & there as to what's going on, but I will admit I only picked up on a couple of them.

Having a philosophy degree, I did enjoy how the story toyed around with the concept of solipsism.  Not to give anything away, but the opening scene is utterly crucial in setting the tone of the film.

What I liked the most about the movie was its symmetry.  Yes, it is weird.  It is a cross between THE TWILIGHT ZONE and ORIGINAL SIN.  However, that said, it also MAKES SENSE.  I don't mind off-the-wall, bizarre stories so long as they fulfill this requirement.  After all, anyone off the street can throw together a story that makes no sort of sense.

So, if erotic thrillers are your game, this VANILLA SKY may be worth taking on.  One thing is certain, whether you enjoy the movie or not:  this flick is most definitely  NOT vanilla!",1115769600,4,1514,4.40072202166065
1437116,3,B00005JKMY,"Not bad, but not anything groundbreaking either. Even though Cruise was good, and the movie seemed like it was going to turn out decent, it was droll and centered more on Cruise doing his thing with his girlfriend(s) more than anything else. The ending was hard to figure out also, did he take reality or just the dream world?

On the whole, the movie led up to something, but never really seemed to capture it altogether. It was as if Cameron Crowe had a good idea what he wanted, but didn't know how to make it seem presentable.

Good for Cruise fans, but for those that like me that just watch him just because, it might not be a good idea to view this film. Unless you have two hours to kill.",1114905600,,696,4.265151515151516
1437117,5,B00005JKMY,"I heard and read many bad opinions and reviews about this movie, therefore when I saw it (4 years after the original release) I had very low expectations.

1437178,1,B00005JKMY,"Cameron Crowe is one of my favorite filmmakers. His films are usually filled with characters who are believable, characters you can care about and a story that makes you feel good. ""Vanilla Sky"" is a complete departure for Crowe as it has none of these things.

David Aames (Tom Cruise), the young, rich head of a publisher producing three popular magazines, lives life to the fullest. Work is a secondary consideration for him and his board of trustees, `the Seven Dwarves', as he calls them, is not very happy about it. His occasional sex buddy, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), is young and beautiful, but is becoming too attached for his own comfort. At his birthday party, David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), a writer, brings a new friend, Sofia (Penelope Cruz). David begins to flirt with Sofia and falls in love. Julie notices this and soon becomes jealous.

""Vanilla Sky"" is meant to be an `erotic thriller', yet I have difficulty labeling it that. There is virtually no sex and very little romance. Many of the scenes between David and Sofia (or Cruise Squared as I like to call them) involve them talking about nothing. But, you see, this is meant to mean they are talking about everything. In their post-coital bliss, they mutter sweet nothings to each other which sound like the worst poetry two love sick teenagers utter to one another. It becomes annoying fast.

It is also difficult to care about David Aames. Young, brash and full of himself, he isn't a very likable person. This is fine at the beginning or end of a film, if the character has changed during the course of our viewing. But Aames doesn't really change. Throughout the course of the film, he becomes more desperate, but he doesn't really become a better or worse person.

Technically, the film is fine. Crowe's films are always very well-made and he doesn't disappoint here. A very early scene shows Cruise walking through an empty Times Square. The shot is arresting and interesting and apparently they were able to shut down Times Square to get the shot. This is just one example of the technical skills employed by Crowe throughout his films.

The film takes a very different turn during the last thirty minutes, by way of explaining all of the strange goings-on. The turn is alluded to very briefly in earlier scenes, but the explanation is so ludicrous that it would be laughable if the film were not so serious about it. I have talked before about believing in what a film is trying to sell you, but I wasn't able to buy into this. For this change in storyline to work, it needs to be more prevalent throughout the film. A few toss-away lines can not build up to the new ending.

""Vanilla Sky"" is really an incomprehensibly bad film. A very disappointing effort from Crowe and Cruise",1113350400,15,2777,4.691991786447638
1437179,1,B00005JKMY,"This morality tale about a spoiled rich young man who has lost his soul does not have one good scene in it. Why? Because the director and the screenwriters try to tell us, rather than show us, about the dangers of excess wealth with no accountability. As a result, we must suffer a series of cliches, while the director lectures us about morality. Because the script is so abysmal, the actors overact. The scenes have a static quality about them that reminds me of B movies I used to watch in the early seventies. Plot? So convuluted that you need Vanilla Sky Cliff Notes on your lap while watching the film. Because of the grand, aspirations of this movie, it must be truly one of the most egregious film failures in the last five years or so.",1113004800,13,744,4.437956204379562
1437180,3,B00005JKMY,"...This is a difficult film to watch, the original Spanish version is just the same but infinitely more credible.

 The characters are generally speaking, cynical and self obsessed rich kids. So the the intial process of identifaction and developmet of connection is fraught with viewer anxst, that in itself is not a failing point, the film draws us in to examining the wrong doing of and towards a bunch of thoroughly dislikeable folk and question the morality of their behaviour and it's consequences.

 A fine intellectual premise, get that figured and the the viewing process becomes a test of social and moral values.

 The pace of the suspense building is perfectly pitched and the myriad of twist and turns in the plot are interesting and infuriatingly engaging. The final solution is for me the let down, fanciful nonsense which blows the entire story apart and renders the investment of your time to dissapointing cheated; at best.

 Diaz is excellent in her menancing and slighty unhinged role, Cruz provides a breath of fresh air in her beautiful and unincumbered character. Cruise is awkward, stumbling and ever so slightly out of his depth. The film seems more a medium to prove his worth as an actor (because let's face it, his x-wife has been trumping him repeatedly since he left her) than it is a means to bring this fascinating story to life.

 Get the spanish version if you enjoyed this and you will see the glaring flaws, hollywood doing arthouse nearly always renders the format lack lustre and about the ""Star""; a shame here really as they seemed just inches from getting it right in many ways.",1113004800,3,1618,4.829710144927536
1437181,3,B00005JKMY,"Some people hate this film, some people love it, i veer towards the love crowd but at the same time there are flaws to this film that i hope won't be overlooked.

As you can see from previous bad reviews, people have not tried to understand the film, they have just taken it at face value and decided that this film was too strange to be good.

I can see where they come from. This film starts off rather normally where events are as you see them. Tom cruise played his part more than adequately and all the actors along with the script conveyed really well the situation where cruise has become disfigured and he is finding it hard to interact with others due to his paranoia and vanity.

The only problem i found when the film took the direction it chose in the last hour, was that the character development of the minor characters was very low. Jason Lee was criminally underused  and id like to have seen the motive for the car crash explored further ( was Lee trying to plant ideas in Diaz's head, to get rid of cruise?)

However, having said that the ending was artistic and beautiful, and despite many plot twists, the film was explained very well at the end, and idealism vs reality among other issues were brought up well.

I would recommened this film to people who want to watch something different. There were Beautiful bits, depressing bits, and even one scary part. Good value for money",1113004800,,1400,4.470588235294118
1437182,5,B00005JKMY,"I had read reviews of this movie when it first came out and that'll teach me to believe them!  I cannot believe that such a plausible tragic story could turn, in the last 40 minutes, into a fantastic science fiction.  It gradually dawns on the viewer that the story has stepped over the reality boundary and it is incredibly moving.  Tom Cruise plays this sort of role very well and all the supporting cast were terrific.  I have purposely avoided giving ANY of the game away.........just watch it!",1113004800,,498,4.625
1437183,4,B00005JKMY,"Back in 1997, spanish director Alejandro Amenabar directed Open Your Eyes, a cult film of sorts that was quite well done and made you think. Cameron Crowe, writer/director of Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous decided to remake it(or as he says, a ""cover version"" of it). And so we have Vanilla Sky, a film that sounds bigger than it is.

David Aames works for a fashion magazine and he's one of those owners that just shows up because he has to but he doesn't do a lot, kind of prances around and does very little. He's a bit self-serving and has a **** buddy in case he doesn't end up in a relationship. He meets Sofia, a beautiful woman who he instantly falls for overnight. Later that morning, he is stopped by his f*** buddy Julie and offers a ride/talk, however she goes nuts and wants more than just casual sex and ends up driving him and her off a bridge. She dies, he lives and we find he's recounting his story about how he murdered his girlfriend later on in flashback style.

To go any further than that would create more confusion and just plain ruin it but it does take some twists and turns and unlike other psychological films that makes you question the reality of the film, the film makes you question it almost haphazardly like you're supposed to question everything without so much an explanation as why that can't be trusted or that with you being kept in the dark. The ending/reveal at the end is neat in a way but apparently there's 4 different interpretations of it.

As for the leads, as usual with people, the handsomest/prettiest actors and actresses people think they can't act. Tom can pull off a good performance and he certainly pulls one off here, it's quite surprising. Cameron Diaz is quite a complicated one because she can be smiling and her eyes suggest something else entirely and Jason Lee can pull off dramatic roles despite being known primarily as Brodie from the Kevin Smith movies. Penelope Cruz, who's quite the looker(the scene at the end on the rooftop, the way she's filmed and lit she looks downright gorgeous), she's kind of flat as a character, maybe it's her speech. She tends to speak kind of soft english.

Watch the film and make what you want out of it because there's not a lot of these films being made, just too bad this one was almost there.",1112400000,,2298,4.516826923076923

It runs a bit long, but it is justified, the ending does not disappoint as I thought it would. It left me thiking about it days after seeing it, and any movie that has the capability to do that is worthy of seeing at least once. However, that is one downside with this film, it's at its best the first time you see it. Very similar to ""The Game"", ""Vanilla Sky"" is a trip that you'll enjoy from start to finish, but once it's over, repeated viewings won't compare.",1112140800,,633,4.283333333333333
1437186,5,B00005JKMY,"As you can see from the customer reviews bouncing between loving and hating this movie, it is not for everyone.

The first time I saw this movie in the theater I was unable to move when it was over.  I was utterly stunned.  I can count on one hand the times this has happened to me over a lifetime of movie viewing.

Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a rich young man who has inherited a publishing empire from his late father.  Cameron Diaz is the girlfriend he really doesn't care about, and Jason Lee plays his best (and perhaps only) friend.  Aames is utterly disconnected from his own life, and seems to care little about anything.  One night his friend (Lee) brings an intriguing dancer (Penelope Cruz) to his birthday party.  Cruise takes up with Cruz, but then experiences a waking nightmare that destroys his life.  I can't reveal more of the plot without giving it away, and I suggest you NOT read any more reviews of this film and just see it--otherwise you'll deprive yourself of one incredible movie ride.

This movie is visually spectacular.  There are scenes that set off the dive klaxon deep within my brain but I couldn't figure out why until much later in the film when the plot is revealed.  What is this film?  Science fiction?  Yes, but...  A psychological thriller?  Yes, but...  A love story?  Yes, ultimately.

It's better not to categorize Vanilla Sky, and just enjoy (or not enjoy) it.  I think this movie either works on you, or it doesn't.  And this is probably the most polarizing movie I have ever seen.  You'll either love it or hate it.

Jason Lee and Cameron Diaz give the performances of their careers.  I would have said the same of Cruise, but then he uncorked Collateral.  Kurt Russell has a relatively small part as Cruise's psychologist, but he nails it perfectly.

Vanilla Sky is based on Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenbar's Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes).  I liked Vanilla Sky a lot more than Abre Los Ojos, unlike most American remakes of foreign films, because it contains additional scenes and more spectacular visuals.  However, an English-only speaker like me can't really make a fair comparision because there are so many subtitles to watch in Abre Los Ojos it makes it hard to watch the actors.  Penelope Cruz plays the same role in both films.

The real value of this film is that it makes you think about what (and more importantly, who) is at the core of your own life, and how will you feel about how you have lived when the clock runs out?

Vanilla Sky is a rare movie--unique in plot, and made with passion and care.  I can't guarantee you'll like it, but there is no other movie more worth taking a chance on.",1111795200,229,2662,4.562367864693446

  The plot is, of course, shown to the viewer as if the scenes were little pieces of a 1000-part puzzle. Therefore one needs to pay close attention to the whole film, in order to understand the constant movement through the present, the past, the reality and the dream concerning the protagonist.

  ""Vanilla Sky"" is a very intriguing movie that will set you wondering about the actual meaning of happiness. As for Tom Cruise, I dare say he plays one of his most challenging roles, and he carries that out perfectly.

1437220,5,B00005JKMY,"""We're now on pause.""
'Vanilla Sky' is one of my favorite movies of all time, for that reason I have discussed it with a number of people.  It is true that you will either cherish, despise, or totally not get this film.

The film is complex both in content and presentation, thus many simply won't get it.

People dislike 'Vanilla Sky' because, the original, 'Abre los Ojos,' is more artsy and less glamorous...and it is for that reason, I gather, that many people prefer the original film and strongly denounce 'Vanilla Sky.'  'Vanilla Sky' is, in my opinion, more graceful and not quite as raw as Amenabar's original.  Crowe made a great story and message digestible for American's, but in the process brought forth such a jarring and real message about so many aspects of life that I think people either don't want to or can't wrap their heads around it.

This is no bastardization.  It is a cultural re-doing of a solid film; with excellent performances and great work by so many others behind the scenes, that ultimately comes off better than the original.  I love this movie because it is a truthful depiction of a man who torments himself...who chooses to bring crap on to himself...and fate cuts him no slack because he has been blessed in many earthly ways, very realistic and unlike your typical Hollywood junk (but of course it is not originally conceived in Hollywood).  So, he throws his blessings away on many an occasion by making foolishly impulsive decisions and generally refusing to take charge of his life.  On other occasions the viewer cringes as he unfruitfully grasps for what he tossed out before.

The blunt realization is that all the little moments in life matter so very-very much.  That is life and 'Vanilla Sky' is a great allegory for some of the most important lessons: the sweet is never as sweet without the sour (hard work); there are no short cuts, no quick fixes; money can not repair the most important problems we are capable of bringing upon ourselves; and particularly if you are even slightly self-aware you must eventually chose to either: wake up (open your eyes) take control of your destiny and live a real life; or you will be engaging in a grand delusion, a dream.

So it's a remake and I haven't seen the original but this movie has a remarkably fitting soundtrack. The songs are actually a part of the movie and help create the different states of mind one will experience if you allow yourself to be taken for the ride the movie will give. This is the true value of this movie. It will show you a state of mind perhaps very foreign to you or very familiar as was my case. Not just entertainment an experience.

It has it's moments: I loved the soundtrack and I appreciated that Crowe was trying his hardest to create his own ""Memento"". I'm also glad that I rented it first -- I certainly won't see it a second time. While listening to Crowe's so-so commentary, I understand that for him this was a huge artistic risk. I also get the feeling that, depite the sincere effort, even he deep down realizes that the film fails.

The basic plot points are straightforward enough: the man who has everything overreaches and loses it all, only to finally understand that he never had anything in the first place. Except, maybe love, and we're not sure if that's what it was because it too was taken away before its time.

To go into more detail wanders into spoilers territory -- suffice it to say the zinger at the end nearly destroyed this movie for me. What was an interesting psychological drama, buttressed by Cruise exceptional performance, fell apart into a very pap, kindler-gentler Twilight Zone ending. I place the blame squarely on Cameron Crowe -- after setting me up by delivering a huge emotional impact surrounding the main character's tragedy, he pimps it out with a bogus sci-fi wrap-up. I felt cheated and betrayed by it.

The other element that came pretty close to wrecking ""Vanilla Sky"" was Penelope Cruz. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt that she isn't well-trained to act in English, and that she really is an good actress, but her performance was so bloody lifeless I couldn't understand what Cruise's character was smitten over (besides her astonishing beauty). ""Vanilla Sky"" would have been better served by another actress in such a critical role.",1101081600,,2016,4.7025495750708215
1437263,5,B00005JKMY,"I have become sick of people reviewing this movie who took no effort in understanding and analyzing what it was about. Naturally, when the toughest movie for them to understand is 'America Pie,' you DO NOT even come close to reviewing Vanilla Sky. So people, please ignore the negative reviews.

Vanilla Sky has a lot of philosophy to it. Dont worry, its not that deep. But the movie has its grounds in it. Tom Cruise is a rich and handsome kid who succeeds his father's multi million dollar corporation. He has everything he wants...women, sex, clothes, cars, yes-men and everything you can think of. He takes the world for granted. Nothing can bring him down...except love. He meets a beautiful girl (penelope cruz) and feels his life has been flipped. But soon an incident takes place that shows him how shallow the world can be. And the best part about the movie is his quest to do the impossible.

Vanilla Sky is a movie that requires thinking and deciphering. But it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure it out. A lot of people have been whining that ""its too wierd"" and ""I cannot understand it."" Most of these whiners are people who only find solace and comfort in watching 'Friends', American Pie, Eurotrip and other teen romance/sex comedies. Vanilla Sky is an exceptional movie and I hope it takes you a dream world where the impossible becomes the possible.",1099353600,12,1372,4.7125
1437264,3,B00005JKMY,"""Vanilla Sky"" is a remake of the Spanish film ""Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes)"", and if you have seen the original film and ""Vanilla Sky"", you might notice that ""Vanilla Sky"" was filmed almost in the same way, most of the scenes are duplicated from the original movie, but there are key differences. The plot and most of the scenes are virtually the same in both movies, but ""Vanilla Sky"" features a different kind of music.

This movie has a rock-oriented soundtrack, the film was directed by Cameron Crowe, a rock aficionado, usually he throws his favorite songs into his movies, so obviously Vanilla Sky is not an exception. The songs are great (R.E.M., Radiohead, The Beach Boys, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, etc), but there is a problem: many times the song has nothing to do with the scene, but Crowe inserted the tracks anyway. Sometimes ""Vanilla Sky"" resembles more a music video than a movie, but at least the music is fine.

The movie has an interesting cast, because there are a lot of familiar faces in ""Vanilla Sky"", like Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russell and Jason Lee. But even though it's a flashy cast, the movie rarely offers highlights with the performances.

Tom Cruise gives a lackluster performance, Kurt Russell makes a good job, Jason Lee is adequate, and Penelope Cruz reprises exactly the same character that she played in ""Open Your Eyes"", as a matter of fact she didn't expanded her role, since she does the same things that she did before. But the character played by Cameron Diaz is a slight improvement over the original character, because Cameron adds more depth with her performance.

Of course, since ""Vanilla Sky"" is a Hollywood movie, the visual effects and the budget are bigger this time, so the only significant improvement over ""Open Your Eyes"" is on the technical side: there are visual effects, there are more technological gizmos, the makeup is better in ""Vanilla Sky"", and the sets are impressive.

But despite those technical improvements, ""Vanilla Sky"" is not an overall improvement over ""Abre Los Ojos"". As a matter of fact, it's very recommendable that if you liked ""Vanilla Sky"", you should rent ""Open Your Eyes"", it's a more modest movie, but it's more effective, it's better done, it doesn't have more pretensions than to tell a gripping story. ""Vanilla Sky"" follows the footsteps of the spanish movie, but it's more pretentious. Anyway, if you haven't seen the original movie, you might even like ""Vanilla Sky"", but you are advised: this is a mixed bag.",1097884800,,2519,4.835266821345708

In my opinion, Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz all deserved nominations for this incredible film.  Only in Garden State have I seen such an enchanting female lead and Tom Cruise gives his finest performance aside from Magnolia.  Something I can not understand is why so many people found this movie confusing.  I am fourteen and have watched the movie ten or more times, but I was eleven when I first saw this film and I still understood it.  I can't get why people are afraid to be captivated by a movie enough to be immersed into the film.  Another reason this is one of my favorite films is because of the incredibly unpredictable ending.

This movie hammered in the moral of the story harder than any story I have ever heard.  It colourfully illustrates the fact that people make choices in life that have consequences.  In this case, mr cruise gets in the car with cameron's character.  This choice caused him great consequences.  I really related to this movie and it hit me so hard that I cried myself to sleep that night after watching it.  But it was so great,  it felt as though I had an epiphony.  Cheesy as that may sound,  its like a door in my mind had just been blown open and I knew exactly how I wanted to live my life.  How I treated people, the choices I would make...it all made sense.

I have to agree the contents are quite abstract and confusing with lots of twists, but if you add more thoughts and pay attention, you will appreciate the message that the director's trying to convey you. It's really like a journey of self-awakening. In contrast, you may find this film as a ripoff if you cann't resolve the puzzles & twists at the perspection level. Besides the mind-blowing storyline, I found the dialogs in the film were magnificent. Here are some interesting quotes:

""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour, and I know the sour.""
""You will never know the exquisite pain of the guy, who goes home alone.""
""I think she's the saddest girl to ever to hold a martini.""
""I'll tell you in another life, when we are both cats.""
""What is the answer to 99 out of 100 questions?... Money.""
""What is happiness to you?""
""Every passing minute is another chance for a new life.""

About the DVD, it comes with some standard features like:
- Director's commentary
- Interview with Paul McCartney
- Prelude To A Dream
- Hitting It Hard
- Music Video 'Afrika Shox'
- Unreleased Trailer
- English Subtitle

Despite this is the exact remake of the Spanish film ""Open Your Eyes"", I really do think Vanilla Sky is a very great film, a revolution of the mind. It keeps me thinking of ""what is happiness to you?""

1437270,4,B00005JKMY,"I was surprised I liked this movie actually. I've pretty much gone off Tom Cruise since the split with Nicole, and no longer particularly like him as an actor. This is the movie that effectively ruined the relationship between him and Nicole, although obviously, things were going wrong before then, and the chemistry between him & Penelope is obvious.

The great thing about this movie? The plot twists & turns. I can't say too much, otherwise I'll give the entire film away. Normally, I hate movies that have to many twists and turns, and you have to concentrate to understand what's happening, but what this, I found each twist & turn all the more intriguing, and it leaves you wondering what exactly the hell is going on. Just when you think there's a resolution, things just take on another turn. This is about taking friendships for granted, relationships etc. The movie is extremely thought provoking, although some of it is instantly forgettable.

Most of the actors did well, but Penelope didn't strike me as the best actress ever, she's pretty wooden, and seems to struggle with the language. Cameron Diaz plays the blonde bimbo once more. Jason Lee was a surprise for me, and although he wasn't in the film enough, and had the damn fully grown beard (somebody pass me a razor!) he was terrific as Tom's best friend in the movie. It's a lot more of a serious role for him, and a step away from his comedy roles in many of the Kevin Smith movies etc.

You can pretty much guess the movie's told almost entirely in a series of flashbacks. There's your usual swearing (at least ol' Tommy-boy doesn't come out with ""friggin'"" like he did every two seconds in Rain Man). There's also a very rough looking sex scene. (""I'm so afraid of the power of this!"") On the positive side, though, there is also a powerful message in morality about the true depth and meaning of a sexual relationship. (""When you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise whether you do or not."") For once, I actually agree with Cameron Diaz.

It's quite an entertaining movie, and whereas some people simply don't like it, it's always the case that I'll end up liking it. Always happens!

Something to look out for: early in the film, David's car's inspection sticker reads ""2/30/01"". A date that doesn't exist, maybe a little insight into the movie?",1092787200,7,2331,4.675609756097561

1437302,4,B00005JKMY,"I have watched Vanilla Sky three times now, and every time it has left me powerfully affected. It deals with many topics that interest me, particularly the study of dreams vs. reality, and the nature of relationships, and love. There is much that is very good about it, however it contains one major flaw that prevents it from being truly great.
 The acting, is overall top notch. Jason Lee turns in yet again another stellar supporting role; he radiates charisma in this performance, and fits the role given perfectly. Cameron Diaz is a fine choice for Julianna, she brings an almost maniacal sense of urgency to her character that was both disturbing and complusively watchable; she simply looks amazing on film. Tom Cruise performs more than adaquetly as well, and perhaps the greatest kudos must be given to Penelope Cruz, who simply lights up the screen here. Her charisma is unmistakable, and she infuses this film with life and vibrancy. This is a film with many powerful images, be it the gorgeous vanilla skies that soar over New York within the dream, or the (SPOILER) unforgettable image of Cruise's David Aames waving farewell to his disfigured reflection in the mirror. It entices in the first viewing, draws you in irresistably, and apon further viewings still moves with great pacing, and many subtle clues and hints can be found that help the viewer understand the nature of David Aame's reality. My only real complaint is that Cameron Crowe for some inexplicable reason (though it certainly must have been because of confused test audiencies, those who this film is not intended for anyway) chose to come out at the end of the film and blatantly reveal all of the films secrets and twists; he talks to the viewer as if we were 5 years old and need him to hold our hand. This film could have been very similar in nature to, and even rivaled Lynch's masterpiece Mulholland Drive had Crowe not chosen to do so, and it is very disappointing that he did in fact choose to do so. But this aside, the film is very compelling and often powerful. I still love the questions it raises concerning love (if his love with Sofia wasn't ""real"", than does it still have meaning?), and the image of ""I will find you in another life, when we are both cats"" that so powerfully emphasizes the power that love can have, and the joy and awe surrounding that human emotion. For a similar image look in the closing chapters of the novel The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman. But i digress. This film is solid, even coming from hollywood, and with big name stars attached. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is willing to be challenged slightly by the film they watch, and those who love to be moved.

It contains anything any moviegoer would want-suspense, romance, action, comedy, and science fiction.  Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz have excellent chemistry.

1437306,4,B00005JKMY,"There is no present when we manipulate the future. The film tries to show us that surviving after death at very low temperatures is extremely dangerous, not for our survival per se but because these business people who are going to propose us with such an adventure will have to occupy our sleep with dreams and these dreams may turn into nightmares, and like all dreams, these nightmares will go on feeding themselves on the psyche of the sleepers. Then coming back to life after a long period of hibernation is going to be slightly difficult because such dreams or nightmares will have erased any clear limit between reality and imagination, and what's more we will come back to quite a different world. Waking up or passing away will be a choice to be made while we are still asleep, hence within our dreams or nightmares. But if these dreams have turned sour how can we desire to go on with them, since we are going to be killed in a way or another in these nightmares, and we want to live, or how can we desire to get out of it since we don't even know it is nothing but a nightmare, hence a dream, not reality ? In other words this film seems to imply that we must not play with the present because we are thus manipulating our survival in a future that we definitely ignore now. This film tries to tell us that we have to assume the present and build whatever future can come out of it with the means we have at our disposal, particularly our psychological means to cope with the present that can be a real unescapable nightmare in a way. The end is of course quite unidentifiable : are we in the future or are we in the present ? Is the character going to wake up in an unknown future or is he going to wake up in the present ? Is he going to come out of a real nightmare in the present, or out of an artificial dream turned sour in the future ? Each one of us will have to decide.

It's a Wonderful Life
Empire of the Sun
As Good as it Gets
I'm not a moron.  I have taste (eheh, or so I think...).  Look, for those that disagree, I'd like to speak to you first, and concede a few things:
This movie IS confusing...Insanely confusing, and it took allot of appreciation away from my first screening.  Also, it is stuffed with allot of ""cinematic sweetener""; almost acts like a music video at times, unbelievably fashionable, even the dialogue pushes the limits and sometimes swims past the buoys of practical.
That said (and without giving anything away to those who haven't seen it), I think it's helpful to consider this not as a drama, but as a Science Fiction movie.  It really is; but it masquerades as a drama up until the end.  That can be frustrating for unprepared viewers, and lends itself to even more confusion as to what is going on.
I'm a huge believer in the technology that plays a central role in the dramatic climax.  I think it will change everything.  So granted, that aspect lent a particular attraction for me to the film.  However, I think the lesson of the movie is important for everyone [and this is my interpretation], ""you make your own life, and it's really not about the big decisions, it's about the small ones that aggregate to form your orientation; orientation that could serve as gravity for good things in your life, or bad"".
Nothing new, nothing earth shattering.  However, that lesson, folded into some of the best cinematography, best music, and darn good acting...
...it earned my five stars, and more than that...I truly love this film.
For those who haven't seen it, please know ahead of time that it'll be confusing...try and watch somewhere you can give it good attention (hard to do at 3 hours, but worth it; I've seen over 5 times).

If you are really into movies, then this one ranks among a small handful of must-see modern movies. Movie-lovers will adore the film; especially the mesmerizing chemistry between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. The two may not be best known for their acting, but in Vanilla Sky it doesn't matter because their love affair was not an act.  When wholeheartedly viewing this film, the very real attraction, love, and desire between the two can be felt - stirring the viewer's emotions and drawing one into the depths of the movie with an amplified appreciation of the story, characters, and themes.

Vanilla Sky is a carefully crafted work of art - upon first glance many find the film distasteful and confusing.  However, with further study many viewers begin to see the magnificence of the work and are moved.  Because appreciation for the greatness of the movie is often only developed over several viewings, this quality likely came at the cost of lackluster box-office sales and mediocre initial reviews.  Nevertheless, the intricate details and  powerful themes woven within the story are there to discover, and give the film a depth and longevity that a typical movie does not have.  Credit must be given to director Cameron Crowe.

Then, as time went by, I found it coming back to me in a song, in an image, in something I overheard.  I decided to give it a second chance and rented it.  What I found upon my second viewing was fascinating.
  The exploration of human obsession with superficial beauty and instant gratification was phenomenal.  David Aames lives for the moment;  he is a young, wealthy, good-looking man who sleeps with gorgeous women, drives fancy cars, wears nice clothes and, best of all, doesn't really have to work!  His world is turned upside down when he catches a glimpse of what could be true love.  When all that he takes for granted in life is taken away and he must face all the personal insecurities he has never even thought of, we are forced to look at ourselves in an uncomfortable way.
  It's hard enough for me, who in no way comes close to Tom Cruise, to entertain the possibility of a physical disfigurement.  The journey that his character takes is at once painful, uplifting, and one of the greatest achievements of subtle introspection delivered through the medium of film that I've witnessed in a long time.

Tom Cruise is perfect in this movie.  He is a cocky, rich, inheritant with the world seemingly at his hands.  In one hand he is the editor of a popular pop culture magazine with a chic apartment and a slick Ferrari. In the other hand he has the pretty but insecure Cameron Diaz as his girlfriend along with his best friend played by Jason Lee. Meanwhile Tom Cruise has an eye for Penelope Cruz and they start to fall for one another.  Thing is that Jason Lee really liked Penelope Cruz and that pisses him off.  But his anger that pales in comparision to the anger Cameron has.  She obviously isn't a fan of the growing relationship Mr. and Ms. Cruise have for one another.  Therefore she turns from the nice and likable character we've seen in Something About Mary and transforms into Mommie Dearest.
That is where the movie does a backflip and then it gets messed up.  Oh it sure does.  I'm not going to summarize the rest of this movie but from there it is a great movie that travels into science fiction and questions reality.
The characters in this movie are hard to forget.  I think they all play their role very well in this movie.  As I said earlier Tom Cruise fits in this movie perfectly as he did in Jerry Maguire, Top Gun and Risky Business. Cameron Diaz is perfect for being a psycho lover and I found it odd that Jason Lee was in this movie.  I picture him as the dude from Mallrats, which is the funniest comedy of all time.
In short, this is a great movie that will make you question life and is also a cool science fiction movie.  Give Vanilla Sky more than one viewing and you will see what I mean and alot more.
By the way the soundtrack to the movie is outstanding.  When Tom Cruise is going insane, they play the Beach Boys - Good Vibrations.  It is such an odd song for this movie but it sounds perfect in a movie like this.",1073606400,2,2154,4.229828850855745

I think that's what everyone should do who didn't understand the movie or just the ending...lol. Its just the most weirdest movie I've ever seen and I mean weird in a good way, then ending is just such a surprise ""twist ending"" and I loved it!!!

Vanilla Sky does just that for me.
This one of my very favorite films. It's so many things, so many adjectives i won't waste space with.
The acting by everybody is top notch. Tom shows that he can give a great performance without his great smile and charming personality in his favor. Penelope, Jason, Noah, Kurt, amazing.
Music..can't say enough about it. The songs and score (by Nancy Wilson) fit perfectly with the visuals.
Visuals..great job again by DP John Toll (also did Almost Famous).
I think a lot of people that saw this film, even saw it more than once, tried to adhere to the explanations laid out in the film. That what was shown and explained was the only possibility and vision. Granted, it was Crowe's vision, but not the only one. There are lots of ways the story could have taken place. e.g. what was real, what was a dream, etc.. choose the one that most fits you, or create your own theorey. That's the great thing about it.",1071964800,3,1194,4.431818181818182
1437438,2,B00005JKMY,"It wasn't that I didn't understand what was going on, it was that it was simply too much work to follow.  Part of the joy of watching a film, as opposed to reading a novel, is that the very act of trying to tell a complicated story in 2 or 3 hours in the medium of movie making compels the storyteller to get to the point.  When a film tries to hard to be an artistic statement, it ends up being just that, a statement.  I don't watch films for statements, I want to be entertained.
I'm not saying this movie isn't an ok rental, but I'd hardly recommend buying it to watch over again, it was way too slow in my opinion to watch again, especially considering once you know the twists, there's nothing there to surprise you anymore.
I did enjoy watching Cruz, she has a powerful on screen presence, and although I like Diaz a lot too, this wasn't the best role for her in my opinion.  Cruise has the ability to make really great films but this one isn't one of them.",1071878400,4,964,4.166666666666667

No one survives a dead stop auto crash at 80 mph; their internal organs would be ripped apart even if they were wearing a seat belt. From that point on all we have are Cruise's musings and suspicions as he dies. Monet's Vanilla Sky is an impressionistic expression of what that painter felt. The movie is the impressionistic expression of a character's deepest hopes and fears.

1437441,5,B00005JKMY,"This movie is a remake of the Spanish 1997 film, Open Your Eyes, also starring Penelope Cruz. I'm really surpirsed by so many negative reviews on here. But, many people that I have talked to just ""didn't get it."" It is a complicated film. Not one that you can walk out of the room to get popcorn and take bathroom breaks while watching. You must pay attention or you will be confused. But, if you pay attention and watch for all the subtle clues and underlying subtext, you will see that it is truly a good film.
Tom Cruise plays David Aames, the young, rich and powerful publishing tycoon who gets whatever he wants whenever he wants it. He has an empty, ""sex-only"" relationship with actress Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz).
He meets the woman of his dreams (Penelope Cruz) at his birthday party who also happens to be his best friends date. But in her, David believes that he just might have found what had been missing in his life for so long.
Julie begins to feel used and pushed aside, and seduces him into her car after stalking him all night. Foolishly, he goes. And instead of the ""fun"" that she promised him, she takes them both over a bridge, killing herself and disfiguring David's face.
What happens next beceomes more unbelievable with each scene. David's world spins out of control as his mind tries to put together the ever changing and foggy pieces to the cryptic puzzle that has become his life. The surprise ending, which is borderline impossible to predict, will amaze you - might even make you angry, as I have read in a few other reviews on here.
But I loved it. I think that it is a very deep film.
If you get a chance, you should watch it once and then watch it again with the director's commentary. Cameron Crowe the director, and his wife, Heart guitarist, Nancy Wilson talk over the scenes to explain a little bit more in depth what he was trying to portray - they also give away vital background clues that will have you rewinding and replaying quite a few times.
This movie is great because a lot of it is left up to interpretation. Which is why I think so many people don't like it. Some people just don't like having to think for themselves.  But I think it's great. This movie means something different to everyone.
The acting is great. I wish Cameron Diaz was in it longer - she plays an amazing psycho!! And I think it's one of Tom Cruise's best performances. Definitley a must see!
I recommend this one for anyone who has a mind of their own!",1069113600,2,2472,4.432967032967033

It looks as though some people that saw this film didn't. This is the type of movie that can really make you think about your own life and what really matters to you. It's the little things, not money, or fame or anything else materialistic. It's about love, it's about a tiny freckle on your lover. Wonderful film. I also saw ""Open Your Eyes"" in which Penelope Cruz also plays Sophia, it is the original spanish version. Penelope & Tom where made to play David & Sophia. This movie means a lot to me.

1437444,2,B00005JKMY,"It's hard to make a surprise-ending movie that satisfies the audience. ""The Sixth Sense"" worked because, once the audience found out the truth, they like the movie even *more*. They said to themselves ""I should have known!"" and they went back to see it a second time. I felt that way watching ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Fight Club.""
But after seeing ""Vanilla Sky,"" I felt confused and ripped off. First of all, half of the movie could have been cut and the story wouldn't have changed a bit. Everything with Kurt Russell was pointless; remove it and you've got the same film. Second, the explanation of what's really going on doesn't answer any questions. It's an uninteresting explanation and it raises a lot more questions than it answers.
There are other problems. The opening scene in Times Square is supposed to be amazing because it's empty. But I clearly saw a crowd held back by police barricades in the background. You'd think the director would digitally remove those people, since it ruins the whole point of the scene.
The romance between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz has no chemistry. When they're naked in bed together and talking, he says he wants to be the mole on her breast. It's supposed to be cute or sexy or something, but it's actually a little creepy. Penelope Cruz looks like she's waiting for the director to say CUT so she can get out from under Tom Cruise.
There are just two good things about this movie. (1) Cameron Diaz. She convincingly acts like she's crazy-in-love with Tom Cruise. Thanks to her performance, the scene in the car (which is the best moment in the film) is a shock. (2) Like every Hollywood film from the last ten years, ""Vanilla Sky"" has the right look --- every set is lit and designed in a slick-but-subtle way.

Rewriting of the screen play was, as everybody agrees, horrible. All the things that made Abre Los Ojos work have gone missing. Why turn Cruise into a millionaire? Why make him run down Times Square? Why, why, why for a thousand of things.

Having been niether a fan of Tom Cruise or Penelope Cruz, i went into this film being more then a little skeptical. But i have always loved the work of Cameron Crow, and i have a great fondness for off-the-wall storytelling.
The exact plot of this film is more then a little too complicated to try and explain here, and in fact there are several different interpretations one can have as to what this movie is about in the first place. In fact, i've run into many people who found it far too confusing to make sense of...but i guess in my own twisted way, i loved that about this film. it's not your average cookie-cutter Hollywood movie. it does make you think, and question what exactly it is you're seeing on the screen.
Having stated earlier that i was never a fan of either Cruise or Cruz...i have to say that one of the main reasons this movie worked so well for me, was their performances. They both rendered these characters beautifully, and their on-screen chemistry comes across so well, that it makes the resulting storyline all the more tragic.
Crowe definitely captures the dreamlike quality on screen that his script so beautifully conveys. and one of the main reasons i love the man's work so much...is his ability to inject humor into otherwise serious situations, which he does here wonderfully. My single complaint would have to be with Cameron Diaz. Her performance is so incredibly over-the-top and annoying, that there is no way to feel any kind of sympathy for her character, no matter how small the amount might have been.",1064793600,,1650,4.6506849315068495
1437480,2,B00005JKMY,"""Vanilla Sky"" is, in short, a complete mess.  Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe set out to remake Spanish director's Alejandro Amenbar 1997 masterpiece ""Abre Los Ojos.""  I guess I made the mistake of seeing the original first and saw where 'Sky' consistently failed to measure up by either (a) losing the plot, or (b) getting interrupted by one of Crowe's vanity vignettes.
Like his restaging of ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" album cover.  No doubt that one-time rock journalist Crowe always wanted to sneak that in there.  But Amenbar didn't need it, nor did he need a whole load of other flourishes that Crowe peppers in here, the empty Times Square shot being the most outlandish (and useless).
The only actors that distinguish themselves here are Cameron Diaz (convincing as a psychotic ex-girlfriend) and Jason Lee (better than Cruise in all their joint scenes).  Penelope Cruz-Cruise seems a bit disinterested in the whole thing.  Who's to blame her?  2nd time she's done the role, once in Spanish, once in English.
I should point out that I love all of Cameron Crowe's original work, most notably the underrated 'Singles.'  I'm sure he'll get back on track with his next film.",1062892800,5,1177,4.909090909090909

First, all of the characters were completely flat. They all seemed the same to me, I really couldn't care less what happened to any of them. Tom Cruise's character was especially vain and annoying. I can't believe so many people find it enjoyable to sit and watch him for two hours.

Second, if you want to make a film with a surprise ending that makes people think, you have to at least leave clues leading up to it. You can't just make up a completely ridiculous explination for something and stick it on the end of a movie. Perhaps the filmmaker should have borrowed a couple tips from M. Night Shyamalan. Instead of having an amazed reaction upon the ending of the movie, I was in complete shock that anyone would be stupid enough to end a film that way. Apparenly, to completely understand the film, one should watch it a second time. Are you kidding me!? I just wasted two hours of my life watching it the first time. There's no way I would ever voluntarily waste another two hours to be completely bored out of my mind for a second time.

Basically, if you have any sense at all, you will stay away from this film. I'm warning you now, this is two hours of your life you will never get back! I'm dead serious, don't blame me if you ignore this review and think, ""Well, it can't possibly be THAT bad, not with such stars as Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz.

I know many people that saw this movie were confused by it and reviewed that they did not like it, because they did not understand it.

However, I really don't see what is sappy about choosing to live a ""real life"" as David Aames puts it. A sappier ending would have been if he had chosen to go back into the Lucid Dream with Sofia. And did the ending of the movie really tie everything up neatly? Was the real plot as it was layed out by the Tech Support character or was the entire movie just all a David Aames's dream?

1437544,5,B00005JKMY,"Many of the reviews of this film simply reflect an appalling ignorance of any other life-perspective than our own linear, rationalistic and materialist Western one. For the Amazon reviewer to fault this film for implying that ""youth and beauty = happiness""---that is like saying King Lear is about good parenting.

 The whole point of this movie, of which the ""Life Extension"" device is just a metaphor, is that most people actually live their lives like the Tom Cruise character after his accident: actually in an artificially preserved state of ""life,"" they struggle against their unconscious (which is full of guilt and repression) and try to make a beautiful sunny sunny happy happy MTV kitsch-fest video of their lives---which they are doomed to fail in as their resistance only creates more and more suffering, wastes more and more time and energy.

 Even before his life-changing accident, Tom Cruise's character was already on this delusional path---as an exceptionally fortunate billionaire heir who is both rich and handsome and has just about what any man could wish for, there is a scene where he tells his buddy that he's ""living the dream."" He is too shallow to even appreciate his own blessings, too self-absorbed to care about others. When he becomes disfigured, he clings to his illusions---mainly, his youth and physical beauty, which form the core of his narcissistic identity and priorities---which of course time and change (the only constant in life) have suddenly and inextricably stripped away, becoming bitter, self-pitying, and despondent. Like many of us, he makes the mistake of identifying with the illusion, pretending that he will live forever and always have what he has---there is no real gratitude towards or appreciation of life.

 You won't get all of that the first time around; I'd recommend a second or third viewing too.

 If all the above just goes above your head, watch the film for Penelope Cruz---she is absolutely irresistible, this small but unspeakably gorgeous woman could charm the Devil himself! Cameron Diaz is scarily realistic, and very cute as usual. Cruise actually puts in a pretty competent performance, while Kurt Russell and Jason Lee shine.",1053993600,7,2201,5.162921348314606
1437545,4,B00005JKMY,"I waged a personal boycott against this movie because I couldn't get beyond Cruise's smarmy smile imposed all over the celluloid.  Last week, my husband borrowed the DVD from a friend.  I got a certain satisfaction at the prospect of Tom's pretty little face being severely disfigured, thereby losing the girl, and I caved.
My first reaction was that this is like ""The Matrix"" series for girls, an exploration of reality in pink and lavendar instead of green and black.  Both raise myriad questions without settling on an Ultimate Answer, and I hesitate to admit that I was entranced.
""Vanilla Sky"" casually acknowledges that romance is superficial and that sometimes cannot be redeemed.  Ever.  This relieves the viewer of the exhausting conflict of most films:  one true love exists for all deserving Everyman Heroes in the world.  The distinctly unlikeable Evil Guy only wrangles whores (especially evil whores) or Hero's woman by force.  In ""Vanilla Sky"" the protagonists are a playboy jerk and girl who only loves him when presented with the draw of his unharmed physicality.  We wax and wane between hate and intense pity as we do for our real-life acquaintances.  We care (notice I didn't necessarily mean ""like"").  There's no preordained cheering-for-the-hero.
Cruise is quite the convincing playboy jerk. I'm sure Nicole Kidman agrees. But I digress; he pulled off the really deep, sad moments, too.  I can't think of another actor better suited.
Penelope Cruz as the girl of his (lucid) dreams is otherworldly lovely and vague.  Whether or not the vague was a result of acting or just a casting coup, I don't know.  It worked in context.  Cameron Diaz is a quietly brilliant actress who deserves larger rolls in dramas that what she's allotted. If you don't see her as the jilted lover here, watch ""Being John Malcovich"".  She can be more than a bubbly blonde-in BJM, she isn't even BLONDE!
See this movie.  Preferably with people. See it for the cinematography, the strange roles, and the controversial ending. You may hate it, may love it, but you will discuss it.",1053388800,,2076,4.936599423631124
1437546,4,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky stars some beautiful people in beautiful settings.  Visually, it is fun to watch--I wanted to find myself in the story.
Tom Cruise plays David, a rich heir to a publishing conglomerate--one who lost his parents at an early age.  He coped by learning to play well.  We find him approaching his mid-thirties, and still playing at life.  He has lots of fun, but not much joy.  Cameron Diaz plays his girl friend.  She loves David, but understands his immaturity, and so pretends to also simply enjoy playing the game.  Sofia (Penelope Cruz) enters the story, and steals David's heart.
The story offers romantic tension, psychological thrills, and science fiction overtones that make this a complex and sometimes plodding adventure.  There are hints of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in the dream-like quality of much of the film, as well as a ""choose your life"" dilemma reminiscent of ""Total Recall.""
The bottom line is that this is a complicated movie.  Some patience is required if one is to grasp and enjoy the story.  Fans of the actors and actresses, as well as those who enjoy a film that stretches, rather than merely entertaining, will applaud it.  The acting, plot, and technical aspects are 5-star, but a rather plodding pace brings to a solid 4.",1053216000,,1251,4.826291079812207

This is really only a minor drawback, though; actually some of the time it works rather well.

1437588,5,B00005JKMY,"Here in Vanilla Sky, a thoughtful reprise of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes (1997), directed by Alejandro Amenabar, we have Tom Cruise, American heart throb and box office buffo paired with his current true love, the amazingly beautiful and very talented Penelope Cruz.
Guess what happens.  The public doesn't like him.  Even though this is a more finely structured and comprehensible film than Open Your Eyes (we'll get to that in moment), Tom Cruise is NOT sympathetic, or at least it takes us until near the end of the film to feel any sympathy for him, and then perhaps what we feel most sympathetic for is the mask that is Tom Cruise in most of the later reels.
I think the problem is that Cruise is miscast.  Unlike Eduardo Noriega, who played the same part in the film directed by Alejandro Amenabar, Cruise is too cute and too privileged to elicit our sympathy.  We almost feel his character has it coming.  After all, he willingly got into the car with his ""stalker"" (Cameron Diaz) presumably to have a little sexual fun.  And this just after spending a Platonic night with Sofia (Penelope Cruz), whom he is now supposed to be in love with.  Furthermore--and this may be just a minor point, but a telling one--Cruise's disfigurement was not as gross as was Noriega's.  One gets the sense that perhaps Cruise insisted on it being that way.
From another angle, one might ask, is this deja vu all over again?  Recall that Cruise was married to Nichole Kidman when he played opposite her in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.  Guess what happened.  The public didn't like it.  Aside from the fact that they didn't understand it, what they didn't like was Tom Cruise.  He was NOT sympathetic.  One could not identify with his cruising various kinky sexual opportunities as a privileged married doctor.
Having said all that, I still think that this film, directed by the very talented Cameron Crowe, who wrote Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and wrote and directed Almost Famous (2000), is the better film.  Why?  Mainly because Crowe demonstrates a better understanding of the underlining theme of the film than did Amenabar.  (Of course he had the benefit of Amenabar's film to improve upon.)
What I am getting at is the precarious nature of our brain's experience of reality.  On one level, I think that is what the film is really all about.  (On another level of course there is a love triangle.)  Throw the cryonics mumble jumble out the window and consider that we might, as some people believe, become software.  As partial products of our own culture we will (at least in the beginning) experience glitches that will destroy our dreams, just as David Aames's guilty conscience destroyed his lucid dream and made him see a projection of his fear and his guilt instead of seeing his beloved Sofia.
If we do become software, there will be imperfect matches between our biological nature and the artificial neural nets we will fuse with.  We will not be freezing ourselves in the future.  Instead we will merge with our machines as we live and become part human and part artificial intelligence--something beyond human.  This is the glimpse of the future that Cameron Crowe extends to us, a possibility that he saw in the Spanish language film not fully worked out by Amenabar.
Despite his miscasting, I think Tom Cruise gave a spirited performance, and I think only his celebrity and the compromised personality of the character he plays kept some movie goers from fully appreciating his work.
Penelope Cruz is more playful here than she was in Open Your Eyes and her role here is somewhat larger.  Crowe makes sure she has ample time in front of the camera to mesmerize us, and she does.  At some point I realized that she reminded me a little of Audrey Hepburn.  Perhaps she has been watching some of Miss Hepburn's films.  (I would bet on it.)  Regardless, she, whom I first saw in Belle Epoque (1992) when she was eighteen, is utterly bewitching.
Also giving an excellent performance is Cameron Diaz as the fatally scorned other woman.  She brings a sexy, haunting quality to the part that works well with Cruise's software ""experiences.""  She is not quite as convincing a stalker as was Najwa Nimri in the original, however, and this may be another reason that this film only gets 7.0 out of 10 stars from the voters at IMDb while Open Your Eyes gets 7.8.
Usually I prefer the original to the remake, the European film to the Hollywood production, but in this case I think it is Vanilla Sky that will be remembered.  At any rate, look past Tom Cruise's celebrity and see this for Cameron Crowe whose vision of a virtually real future is intriguing and reveals that he did his homework.",1046736000,43,4702,4.710268948655257
1437589,3,B00005JKMY,"After the unprecedented success of Almost Famous, director Cameron Crowe assembled a formidable cast.  Jerry Maguire (another Crowe movie) star Tom Cruise returned, as did Almost Famous star Billy Crudup, completing a line-up that consists of Penelope Cruz (who starred in the original Abras Los Ojos), Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell and even small turns by Tilda Swinton and Alicia Witt.  The story revolves around hot-shot billionaire David's (Cruise) romantic encounter with Sofia (Cruz), a person who he thinks he may have found true love with.  That is until his jealous sort-of-girlfriend Julie (Diaz) drives them both off a brdige, killing herself and disfiguring him horribly.  Or did she?  Flashing back and forwards between the present, with David trying to build his life up again with Sofia, to a present where David sits in prison with a latex mask over his face, accused of murder and talking to psychologist Kurt Russell, Vanilla Sky constantly confuses you as to what is going on.
The cast is close to perfect, with the famed romance between Cruise and Cruz being particularly evident, something that clearly works to Crowe's advantage.  Cruise is clearly comfortable working with Crowe again and resultantly puts in one his best performances to date (but still not beating his turns in Born On The Fourth Of July and Magnolia).  However, whilst many have praised him for trying a brave role in that his good looks are marred by facial disfigurement are a little off the mark; it's not really that bad and he's not disfigured for a great deal of the movie.  Cruz has a willowy elegance to her that lends itself perfectly to the role and Diaz as always is a pure delight whenever she's on screen.  Russell and Crudup for the most part have thankless roles but do the best they can with them, rounding up a list of impressive performances.
However, Crowe's film is decidedly over-ambitious and cannot satisfy on a number of levels.  Whilst it's true that the ending will make you see everything in a new perspective, this doesn't mean that you'll have had any more fun watching an ultimately cloying first date between the leads and a lot of flashy effects with David constantly waking from dreams, being told to open his eyes and being asked if he can tell the difference between dreams and reality.  If it wasn't for the fact that Crowe clearly thinks himself very clever for doing this and signposts a twist ending right from the very beginning maybe Vanilla Sky would be more entertaining at a basic level and also on a psychological level.  As it stands though this is a movie with a good resolution and great performances.
Still, to say that a film's only flaw is the fact that it's got too many ambitions has got to be something to be applauded.  Not long ago a movie like Vanilla Sky wouldn't have been made with an all-star cast and the movie's marketting did it no favours by not delivering exactly the romance with a twist story that Cruise fans might have been expecting.  As it stands this is an intriguing piece of moviemaking that doesn't quite pull it off, but at least it shows a step forward in Hollywood if they're prepared to make adult movies such as this, along with recent pictures such as Insomnia, Lantana and The Others.  Given this, maybe Vanilla Sky shouldn't be condemned completely.",1046044800,3,3322,4.793345008756567
1437590,3,B00005JKMY,"People who have seen this movie before Abre Los Ojos, the Alejandro Amenabar film on which this is based, well, let me say this.  When a remake tries to mirror the original in certain scenes to the point of paraphrasing the dialogue, it can't be that good.  Surely some innovation is required to lift it above the original, yes?
Basically, David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a spoiled millionaire whose parents left him in control of three magazines in a worldwide publishing house.  He has 51% control, but seven other shareholders, derogatorily known as the Seven Dwarfs, have the other 49% and have nothing but contempt for this breezy, smug, playboy.  At his 33rd birthday party, he's introduced to his best friend Brian's new girl Sofia, and falls for her.  Feeling that he has been ""snowboarding through life with no focus,"" Sofia tells him that ""every passing moment is another chance to turn it around.""
However, before he can make good on that chance, he gets in a car accident that damages his face.  His good looks gone, and his life goes downhill as a result.  All the time, he's telling this to a psychologist while in prison for murder, a murder he insists he didn't commit.  David thinks the Seven Dwarfs have set him up in order to wrest control of the publishing house.  His face is repaired eventually, but things take a turn for the weird.
Cruise plays himself as usual, arrogant, smug, cocky, with a smile that makes me side with the Seven Dwarfs.  He acts nonchalantly in a scene where he and Brian are nearly killed in a car accident, laughing with Brian when the latter says ""Your whole life flashed before my eyes--almost worth dying for.""
Jason Lee (Brian) comes off the best here, not bad in a drama role, but someone who in contrast to Cruise is the average guy yearning for that girl of his dreams, but can't compete.  He has a good line to that effect:  ""you don't know the exquisite pain of the guy who goes home alone"" and also his speech on love being the sour and the sweet, where the former makes one appreciate the latter.
Penelope Cruz really has a thankless role here.  It's bad enough that she has to reprise a role which she did three years before, but she isn't as good-looking as she was in the original.
Cameron Diaz has a smile that lights up her whole face, and plays Julianna, a girl David treats callously, as someone who shows some deep feelings through her shallowness.  She even tells David in the car, ""when you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise whether you do or not.""
And Kurt Russell as the psychologist is clearly modelled after his Spanish counterpart Cheta Lara, down to glasses and beard.
Maybe the cinematography of Monet's vanilla sky realized, plus Nancy Wilson's melancholy theme ""Elevator Beat"" made it worth watching, but other than that...  All in all, way inferior to the Spanish original, which I hope those of you who haven't seen this watch first instead.  Then watch this and draw your own conclusions.",1045872000,6,2976,4.64

1437615,2,B00005JKMY,"Two weeks before I watched 'Vanilla Sky', I happened to watch the original 'Open your Eyes'.  Had I not watched this, I may have liked 'Vanilla Sky' a lot more.  I really disliked the way little things had been changed to suit a more mainstream audience, for instance changing Sofia's (Penelope Cruz) job from mime artist to ballet dancer.  I felt the remake lost all mysteriousness because of these changes.

I really didn't think the film needed all these 'celebrities' (Tom cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell), to help sell the film, cos it's a good story without them.

I also felt that Cameron Diaz was miscast.  I usually really like her, however I could not believe that Tom Cruise's shallow character would turn someone so beautiful down.  I actually liked her character of Julie (though I don't think I was meant to), cos she seemed so normal compared to the oringinal version, where that character was completely crazy (and no way near as beautiful).
I found 'Vanilla Sky' so much more confusing than 'Open Your Eyes', (which is strange cos the original is foreign!).

If you like any of the above flicks, this one is worth the time.
This film is trippy, multi-dimensional, and sincerely requires at least three viewings to fully integrate all the little 'hints' that it brings.
I knew, the first time I viewed it, that by opening with the haunting music of Radiohead's 'Everything In It's Right Place', after windy New York overhead cam shots, including the hauntingly dark Dakota building, where John Lennon lived for so long and where he died, that this movie was something to be reckoned with.
Cameron Crowe's use of music in this film is superb, each little bit corresponds with the movement of the plot...for this I truly commend him. As far as plot, it takes, as I say again, a few viewings to really integrate all the characters, their motives and their actions, to really understand what this movie is trying to say. From Julie Gianni's cell phone ring ('life is but a dream') to Tom Cruise's character saying 'living the dream, baby, living the dream', to Jason Lee's character saying 'I'm drunk, and I'm from Ohio!', to Kurt Russell's character mentioning that he's from Ohio...there are so many subtle qualities to the writing that are missed on the first or second viewing...Tom Cruise, who I believe may be a very fine actor, but takes the 'easy way out' with more ordinary, general public pleasing roles, is really incredible in this, much as he was in 'Eyes Wide Shut'...when he takes the chance, he is truly riveting as the character he takes on...really believable in his pain, anger and anguish...
all in all, a very mind-trippy experience and a true visionary filmmaking idea...
kudos to you, all those who made this film, and all those who choose to watch it with an open mind...what will you say about your life to this day? is it life, or is it a dream?

1437617,5,B00005JKMY,"Shrouded by the initial revelation that Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz were seeing each other at the time of the film's release, the matter of whether the film was any good or not became a moot point. It's a travesty then that such a blinding piece of work has more crept out under the radar (despite the A list names attached) rather than explode into public consciousness as it rightfully should have.
Simply put, if there was ever a reason for the word 'unique' to be applied to a film, than Vanilla Sky is it. Reuniting Cameron Crowe (the most romantic director in Hollywood this side of Baz Lurhman) and Tom Cruise for the first time since Jerry Maguire, the two come together to forge a magical, hynoptic, elegant, polished film about redemption, hope, status and above all else, love. From the opening montage in an eerily vacant Times Square where the camera literally bombards you with image after image, the tone is set, representing David (Cruise) Aames' emotional and mental state as well as remaining a statement about advertising as a whole. It's scarily effective film making from a director not renowned for his use of avante guarde imagery. Tom Cruise himself has never been better than he is here, creating a character that is uncompromisingly self assured and yet frighteningly vulnerable at the same time, stirring feelings of confusion as to whether we are actually supposed to love such a successful and highflying character.
The earth shattering event that quite figuratively destroys his life, brings him down from so high above the rest of us to bury him at a status that renders him emotionally distraught and Cruise portrays this with heart wrenching honesty and intensity. Sterling supporting roles are delivered by Kurt Russell, playing against type as the 'father figure' psychotherapist, Penelope Cruz, embodying the perfect antidote to Aames' overly comfortable and therefore boring lifestyle, and Jason Lee, who now finally is receiving the roles he was destined to play. It's a second crime that an actor as acomplished as Lee has not been offered roles as important as this sooner.
As the film spins it's twisted tale, things take a decidely dark turn as, along with the audience, Aames' begins to suspect he may have lost the plot somewhere along the line. A masterful move on Crowe's part as the audience feels almost exactly as the 'hero' of the piece, thereby providing an 'emotional anchor' for the remaining events that play out. The beautifully orchestrated chaos of the last two hours is finally explained in a tour de force of editing and deft handedly paced flash back scenarios/montage, culminating in one of the emotionally resounding endings to a Hollywood blockbuster/drama seen in recent years.
The final message in Vanilla Sky is one of pure hope that strikes a powerful chord with anyone that has felt, at some point in their life, they were not in control of the events that spiral around them. With Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe has fashioned a film that is timeless in it's sensitivity, first class in it's use of music to compliment, if not actually tell, the story itself (special praise must be handed to Crowe's wife and the film's composer Nancy Wilson for crafting such a haunting and mature score) and renders every other romantic Hollywood film cold and heartless.

1437620,4,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is clearly a landmark in cinematic entertainment, and if the average movie buff is searching for something fresh, intelligent, and simply moving, this movie is for you.  However, do not expect the conventional movie experience, and aboslutely forget everything you thought the trailer has told you. Its misleading, and quite frankly, if the movie turned out to be what the trailer eludes too, it would have been a mediocre film.  Thankfully, it provides the audience with an experience that is a mind blowing collage of images, emotions, and mysteries that will keep any intelligent person interested, and at times intense. (I sat on the edge of my seat this entire film, though that is not to say that this is some sort of fast paced, sensationlized thriller)  If you think that you may be speculative going into this, understand that it is intense based on the way it is put together, because if your looking for action sequences, stunts and eye candy, go see XXX.  The fact of the matter is, is that this film simply rocks.  Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances, and is superbly backed up by energetic and believable roles played by Penelope Cruz, Kurt Russel, and Cameron Diaz.  The only problem I really found is that about 20 min. of footage could be deleted, and the movie would be just as good.  However, unlike what most people say, the editing should not come NEAR the ending.  The last 15-10 min. of the film is what makes this movie such a masterpiece. Its smart, beautiful, and moving.  If you want something different, give this a rent, open up your mind just a tad, (and yes I tend to be a very close minded person sometimes!) and experience it.

While a cinematographer's dream, the story of a self-indulgent man facing the reprecussions of his choices, just kind of lies there.  The casting was promising, but the story kills any of their efforts.  It just didn't seem to have the 'punch' one would expect, given the premise and the setting.  Also, the trailors really set you up for a greater expectation than you come close to getting.
The end also seems to be one of those story-telling devices in the category of 'Oh no!  We need to tie this all together and we've got 5 minutes to do it.'  I felt strongly that the ending was just thrown together and not actually a strong part of any part of the story.

The ending helps you make since of it all, but it still wasn't enough to save this movie for me. I thought the movie spent too much time trying to keep me guessing rather than delivering a good story. I thought the plot was spotty and the climax was really a low point. Tom Cruise does deliver a pretty good performance. This movie was still one of the worst movies I have ever seen though. It's not worth the price of admission. I know that our technology is pretty advanced and science can do many things, but why would you want to stretch a movie with this type of storyline into a 2+ hour flick. I would rent this first before buying it. That way if you don't like it, you only paid four bucks for it. This movie was so bad I didn't even want to rate it.

1437659,4,B00005JKMY,"If you received an Amazon.com gift certificate for the holidays and you're cruising through DVDs you might like to own, or if like me you saw 'Vanilla Sky' in the theater and believe you might enjoy it a second (or third, etc) time, go ahead, purchase a copy.  No matter how you view(ed) it, you need to watch this film more than one time.
I read a well-known film critic's review of this film before I saw it the weekend it opened in theaters.  The gist of the review was; you have to see it twice to understand it.  I saw it once, enjoyed it thoroughly and left the theater thinking; well, I understood it the first time, that was pretty good.  I also knew it wanted to see it again, if for no other reason that to get a second look at the Times Square Scene, which I originally had believed was computerized.  Then I began to talk to other movie-goers, friends who saw it later, then after release to video, friends who bought the film.
This is when the film became even more fun than before.  On viewing, the visuals were lush, the music rocked, the cast was beautiful, the morality tale of the danger of depending on your wealth and your looks, were all great assets.  But the discussions with friends and the reading of reviews; the hearing others tell you, ""I got it too..."", then relating an entirely different take on the film, what it meant, what it was, how it happened...that was just too much fun.
So, I delayed getting the DVD for awhile so that I couldn't hear the commentary until I had read/heard dozens and dozens of 'meanings'.  Now, having watched the film again several times on my own DVD, I did indeed 'get it' the first time, but unlike so many of these other reviewers, I don't see that as a negative.  I liked figuring it out.  Hearing the commentary confirm that it was indeed 'a' possible version that the director had in his mind was interesting, as was so much more of his commentary and inside information about the film itself and the making of the movie.  The two featurettes were enjoyable as well.
So, if there are movie lovers out there who haven't seen this film even once, or you have seen it only once...you need to see it...twice.  Don't let the negative comments of friends and reviewers deter you from the enjoyment of the experience and the chance to draw your own conclusion in the clouds of the Vanilla Sky.",1041120000,2,2352,4.431554524361949

1437661,1,B00005JKMY,"Just a few comments about this film and reactions to other reviewers.
1. This is not an ""intelligent"" film.  Some people like to throw that word around in regard to this film, and it just doesn't fit.  Why?  Because the whole ""false reality"" in the film is not original.  It is an interesting idea, however it was not thought up by the writers or directors of this film.  I've read that this is actually just a remake Spanish film from 4 or 5 years before, so there is really no contesting this point. --- Films like The Matrix, Fight Club, Memento, etc. deal with perception of reality in a much more entertaining and original manner.(this last statement should not be a revelation to anyone, as 2 of those movies are extremely popular).
2. (...).  This is my big gripe with this movie, and in my opinion, a significant reason why this is not an ""intelligent"" film.  It related in almost no way with the rest of the film.  Ooh, there was some weak attempt at foreshadowing in the commercials on the TV.  Big deal.  The ending was such a departure from the rest of the movie and so poorly done that it ruined an otherwise entertaining movie.
3. On the plus side, the movie opened up with some Radiohead and Sigur Ros, which scored major points in my book.  But then the ending ruined everything.
So anyway, if you wanna enjoy the movie, watch the first hour and 45 minutes, and then just turn it off.  Of course you won't do this, but it was worth a try.  Also worth checking out for the attractive people and decent music.  And Jason Lee kicks (...).",1040601600,2,1551,4.415492957746479

This is the worst movie ever made.  Bar none.  The plot makes no sense, Tom Cruise is horribly disfigured so there's nothing to look at.  I read another review that said the plot was full of holes.  That's the beauty of this movie.  You won't care!  You won't spend time afterwards picking out plot holes, you will just not care AT ALL.  Additional time thinking about this movie will just waste more time.

In addition, the movie does give you something to think about (e.g. What is the difference between reality and dreams?  If you could  re-live your life what would you do differently?)

1437774,2,B00005JKMY,"""Vanilla Sky"" is an unremarkable American remake of the excellent Spanish film, ""Abre los Ojos"" (Open Your Eyes). In each film, the plots are virtually identical. A wealthy, privileged, and handsome young man, David Ames (Tom Cruise) has a girlfriend, Julie (Cameron Diaz) whom he scarcely values and a best friend, Brian (Jason Lee) whom he treats shabbily. During his birthday party, David meets and falls in love with Brian's date, Sophia (Penelope Cruz), and ignoring the potential consequences to his friendship with Brian, he spends an idyllic, platonic, evening with her. Subsequently, however, a series of bizarre events radically disrupt David's life and his sense of confidence, which leads both him and the film's viewers to question what is real and what has actually happened to him.
In the introductory remarks to the DVD, producer and star Tom Cruise describes how impressed he was with ""Abre los Ojos"", and how after viewing the film he felt as though he had overheard a conversation in which he himself would like to participate. Had Cruise and director Cameron Crowe made any unique contributions to the story then perhaps he could have gotten his wish. Unfortunately with ""Vanilla Sky"", Cruise hasn't joined the conversation but has reproduced it with more money, more visuals, and hyperbola.
""Vanilla Sky"" is in fact a visual movie and it's tempting to argue that perhaps it is a visual interpretation of ""Abre los Ojos"". (It isn't.) In ""Vanilla Sky"" many of the clues about David's life are rendered visually and at the end of the film they are explained in purely pictorial terms. This is a sharp departure from ""Abre los Ojos"" which develops its psychology and dramatic tension through dialog and through very accessible characters. It is easier for us to identify with Cesar (the protagonist in ""Abre los Ojos"") than with David because we feel that while his lifestyle may differ from most of ours, he is still human in the same way that we are. ""Vanilla Sky"", by contrast, places its' characters in a realm of privilege beyond our reach by effectively glamorizing them. The protagonist is no longer just a wealthy, privileged youth, he is now the CEO of a company in New York city. His girlfriend is no longer just some woman he picked up, she is now a famous celebrity. It's as though Crowe is shouting, ""look, this story is too good to have `normal' characters, so I'm going to invest them with superstar status. ""Abre los Ojos"" give us universally recognizable people and ""Vanilla Sky"" gives us caricatures from Entertainment Tonight, People Magazine, and Vanity Fair. Don't get me wrong, Tom Cruise is hardly a bad actor, but in this film he pretty much plays himself: a handsome, wealthy guy. Despite the film's excessive glamorization of Julie, Cameron Diaz manages to infuse her with genuine human feeling. In an extremely believable moment of rage and vulnerability, the love struck Julie confronts David with the declaration ""your body makes promises even when you don't!"" This memorable sentence is perhaps this film version's only significant contribution to the story.
While Cruise and Crowe inflate the appearance of their characters, they also manages to suck the wind out of the story's powerful conclusion. Without giving away the conclusion it is safe to say that by the end of the film symbolism and reality collide sharply. The conclusion of ""Abre los Ojos"" makes a courageous distinction between the two, while ""Vanilla Sky"" just can't bring itself to do so. Having inflated the appearance of its characters and setting, Cruise can't seem to face the stark implications of the conversation he desperately wanted to be part of. At the end of the film, Cruise and Crowe make a small but very important change to both the plot and to Sophia's character that render their version of the film, a flashy, and sentimental distortion of the real thing.
The philosophical and psychological concepts of this film are fascinating but it is more appropriate to discuss them in my review of ""Abre los Ojos"".",1032912000,28,4039,4.967503692762186
1437775,4,B00005JKMY,"I was intrigued by the previews for this film, but was afraid it would be similar to the whole ""Eyes Wide Shut"" debacle - a pseudo-psychological ""thriller"" that didn't thrill in the slightest. Thankfully, I was rather surprised - this is a very entertaining film with unpredictable twists and turns, some of which are in the style of ""Jacob's Ladder."" I was kept guessing until the big reveal, and The Truth was a total shock to me; I truly hadn't expected that kind of element to this film - I really can't say what sort of element I'm talking about, as that would absolutely ruin some of the surprise.
The story revolves around David Aames (Tom Cruise,) a charismatic, rich, and witty executive living a charmed life, but only skimming over the surface. He quite unexpectedly meets the woman of his dreams, and from there, things begin a completely unpredictable course of events that rapidly spiral out of his control - or do they? Is Cameron Diaz's character alive, or is he simply losing his mind? What's happening to Penelope Cruz? The plot is engaging, and I was wondering what would happen next. It's also a true aesthetic treat, with well-crafted scenes and beautiful colors. The direction is very good, the acting above par, and the storyline engaging.
The special features are entertaining, giving behind-the-scenes glimpses with the cast and filmmakers, as well as some insight into how the film came to be. An enjoyable experience, start to finish, and I definitely recommend it.",1032480000,6,1492,4.877952755905512

I haven't really seen a film like it, and I loved every minute of it. It's very hard to review without giving anything away, but I can't think of a single flaw in the movie.

1437780,1,B00005JKMY,"So if the main character, David, loses everything and goes mental because his face is disfigured, doesn't that sort of make him a vain vapid jerk?  Wouldn't it have been a good idea to use an actor who could play vain and vapid and still engage the audience's sympathy?  It also would have helped if David's competition for Sofia was someone to really worry about;  Jason Lee just seemed kind of sardonic and unthreatening.  Suppose David was worried about someone like George Clooney?  That would make him a bunch more desperate I think.
By the way, Noah Taylor did a fine job as Mr. Confuso at the end of the film.  Taylor is always so interesting to watch.

The theme, is about true love as much as about dream and reality, a very relevant topic in the age of abundance of virtual reality. Although pretty trite the plot is after the charismatic Matrix, it still is a touching one, with the help of the atmosphere, especially the ""vanilla sky"".
The acting is beautifully spontaneous, lively, and exemplary in every respect. You can say Tom Cruise was ""overacting"", but that is what acting is all about.
The DVD comes with a short documentary of an around the globe promotion trip of the movie, and a commentary of every scene in the movie by the director. I found the commentary very interesting.",1030752000,,798,4.7898550724637685
1437804,3,B00005JKMY,"In Vanilla Sky, Tom Cruise plays David Hayes, a self centered and spoiled magazine editor with daddy issues who has his world rocked by an event that robs him of the control he's always taken for granted.  One bad decision deprives him not only of being who he is but also of his only chance at true love. Then, mysteriously and without explanation, David seems to have a do over of sorts.  When the movie opens we find David imprisoned and recounting the bizarre turn of events in his life to a jailhouse phsychiatrist in an attempt to to recall the lost memory of what led him  being charged with murder.

The biggest and most damning flaw of this movie is Penelope Cruz as David's love-at-first-sight dream girl. She's so incredibly annoying and she plays the part so badly that it almost drains the movie of any enjoyability. Bad directing and bad casting ruined the most significant character besides David Hayes.

It appears this role wasn't much of a stretch for Tom Cruise but he certainly gives us a living, breathing person in contrast to Penelope's lifeless corpes of a character. Cameron Diaz as David's sex toy shows she can act.

1437805,4,B00005JKMY,"This film was provocative and interesting, and caught my imagination at several points, although I sometimes suffered from the twists and turns that became outrageously confusing enough that they broke into my enjoyment. To say this remake of the original Spanish version of the film is an exercise in stream of consciousness and exploration of different reality perspectives and multiple forms of truth and experience is the understatement of the year. At several points I got a headache trying to figure out what was really going on, and although it was obvious that a lot of the sequences were dream-based excursions, trying to keep any kind of meaningful storyline straight became personally difficult.  Finally, then, I gave up the ghost of logic, and just enjoyed the sequences for what they were; an emotional roller-coaster ride.
This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the film, for the performances of Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz were all quite good. Based on what I understood, I thought Cameron Diaz literally stole the movie in terms of the level of performance she delivered, with a range of emotions so well covered that she was entirely believable throughout the film.  Penelope Cruz is drop-dead gorgeous, and could make me believe anything she wants with a simple flutter of her eyelashes and those big beautiful eyes. And even Tom Cruise, a terrific actor who sometimes grates on my nerves with his reliance on his over-earnest macho deadpans as a way of ""emoting"" was very good here. His sense of desperate bewilderment and incomprehensible confusion is telling, and he really does seem to be way over the edge and visibly out of control and out of his element as a result of all that whirling around (and within) him.
The movie is well choreographed and extremely pleasing in terms of the way it has been filmed, so that it is very colorful, eventful, and suspenseful. The plot is so convoluted that no mathematician could unravel it, so the best way to approach the movie is as an object exercise in alternative realities and how one copes with the possibilities. It is a bit pretentious in its ambitions, and it by no means successfully executes whatever vision it has. But it is good (if sometime confusing) entertainment, and I highly recommend it.

1437806,5,B00005JKMY,"The beauty, or some would say the downfall, of this movie is its multi-level intricate workings, that you can't pick up on all entirely would you watch this movie for 2 years straight.
Open YOUR eyes, and stop looking for clear meanings or 'deep' meanings that are blatantly obvious.  It's different for everyone.  Cameron Crowe himself realized in the end the movie made its own directions, with or without his guidance.
Maybe the movie is a futuristic erotic thriller.  Is it a fever pitch of maudlin sentimentality?  A tragic love story?  How bout just a dream inside of the coma.  Was that voice in the end waking David up to the future?  And maybe, just maybe, the whole thing was Jason Lee (such a great actor)'s novel he so desperately worked on between the lines in the movie.
So pick a direction, or just watch the movie for its beauty.  It has tons of small nuances that you will take with yourself into the rest of your life, because its always those small things that you remember.  Maybe how a lover threw her arm around you, or how you held off on a kiss, and not the sex that came and went.

1437807,2,B00005JKMY,"I'm sure that you've read all of the mixed reviews surrounding Vanilla Sky at this point. I'll be honest the movie starts of well, and right after the suicidal car crash, the movie literally crashes. What could have been a great film actually declines rapidly trying to be some sort of Nuevo avant-garde wanna be Sundance psychoanalytic thriller. The best performance in the film is surprisingly delivered by Cameron Diaz, who seems to be the only one who can play a character with any credible substance. Every other cast member seems to just overact their part to the extreme, especially Cruise and Cruz. In some parts the film even attempts to be humorous but the comic relief that surfaces fails considerably. A geek with a pocket protector and a Member's Only Jacket wouldn't even be able to find any of the humor in this film funny. This twisted plot fails so miserably when it finally unfolds in the last 15 minutes. Watching this movie will make you want to grab a Gillette razor and slice your vein. They should make contestants on Fear Factor watch this film, the first one that suffocates or falls asleep looses.
However, The only good quality conveyed here is Cameron Crowe's beautiful cinematography. The camera work is in a class of its own. The Time Square scene in the beginning is awesome. But at times, I will admit, you don't even know if you're watching Vanilla Sky or a reject IKEA/Banana Republic ad. So if you do decide to buy or rent this, I suggest viewing it for the visual art and not the demented storyline.",1030492800,3,1535,4.667896678966789
1437808,5,B00005JKMY,"Cameron Crowe's dark remake of Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 Spanish film, ""Abre los ojos"" (also starring Penelope Cruz) is a mind warping experience.  Welcome to a world where dreams and reality are seamlessly interwoven, so it is impossible for the characters, the viewers and maybe even Crowe to tell where one ends and the other begins.  This will be a frustrating film for anyone who hopes to make sense of it.  To enjoy it one must relax and allow oneself to be mentally flagellated for two plus hours.
Like all lady or tiger stories, the film will generate great debates among the intelligentsia about which parts of the story are real and which are the dreams.  They will ponder the philosophical message regarding materialism, superficiality and emotional depth.
However, for a great many the response will be, ""Huh?""  Crowe keeps us guessing until the very last frame at which point he throws us the final curve and abruptly ends the film.  In the featurette that comes with the DVD, it is clear the Crowe is relishing his role as tantalizer, taking great pains to make each scene as ambiguous as possible to keep it open to multiple interpretations.  That's what makes the film fun, if you like that sort of thing.  Personally, I like closure, but I can appreciate Crowe's deliciously evil intentions.
As is always the case with Cameron Crowe, the presentation is innovative and visually interesting.  Crowe has a terrific and unique way of crafting his films that is very engaging.  In this film, he purposely avoids defining his characters, preferring to keep their motivations abstruse.  For him to maintain the vagueness, it is important that we remain confused about the characters' personalities.  In this regard, he succeeds spectacularly.  The film is a bit too long and bogs down slightly in the middle, but just when we are about to get bored, Crowe throws us another brain bender to keep it interesting.
Kudos go to the makeup department in the creation of Tom Cruise's facial disfigurement, which is realistically hideous and effective.
The acting ranges from good to great.  This is a particularly difficult film for actors since the characters are meant to remain indistinct.  It is hard to render a character when the director demands that his/her motivations and personality keep changing, but the cast adapts beautifully.  Tom Cruise is powerful and tortured as Aames, the convoluted protagonist.  Since the entire film is essentially shot from his perspective, it is important that we share his bewilderment and consternation, which means he must project those emotions onto us.  This he does with extraordinary effect, delivering a gut wrenching performance that takes him (and us) to the brink of insanity.
Penelope Cruz is excellent as his sexy and supportive love interest.  But Cruz is eclipsed by Cameron Diaz, who steals the show with minimal screen time.  Diaz swings from sweet and adorable to vicious and maniacal with such ease that it is frightening.  Jason Lee is also good as Aames' fickle best friend and rival.  Lee naturally projects a trustworthy persona, so when he turns on Aames it creates the startling effect that Crowe wants.  Kurt Russell is okay as the psychologist, but this is a more cerebral role than his skills can handle.  Russell is a naturally visceral performer, great in roles as the tough guy with a big heart.  Here he seems a bit out of place.
This film is deviously crafted and expertly presented with deft performances by the cast.  It will drive most viewers a little nuts, which is its intention.  This will also mean that some people will really dislike it.  I rated it 9/10.  If you think you can figure it out, you're dreaming.",1030060800,3,3698,4.919354838709677

Oh but the world needs entertainment, or is it that the world needs distraction from the evil sheet that's going down.  Bread and circuses didn't hold a candle to video.
Oh well on a more specific note this was a mediocrely crafted  psychedelic version of The Game (another waste of time) with a sort of Crowlian twist, and you either see what a sad soulless mess Crowley was or you idolize him as he idolized himself .  Crowley, like Freud, in attempting to kill the mean-spirited Judeo-Christian God only wound up letting his own angry unexamined little psyche take his/her place. Ah but I diverge from the divergence that my subject of deriding this movie, or was it  ""civilization"" is; well, either way they both suffer from the same preoccupation with uber wealth, high-tech toys and the fantasy that science will save us from our own mortality and/or our or society's unethical choices.
So, ""Turning and turning in the widening gyre....""  Its not the sheep that deserve condemnation, for they are for the most part only sheep/victims. It's the shepherds I would damn to the eternal pit of hell, and Hollywood as the shepherd of the psyche of man should take up about as much space down there as it does here.

1437822,4,B00005JKMY,"This film has engendered a great deal of hostile reaction, and I think that about 90% of that is a result of frustrated expectations. Given that the film was directed by Cameron Crowe, who had previous directed JERRY MCGUIRE and ALMOST FAMOUS, and starred Tom Cruise, who had previously been in JERRY MCGUIRE and the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films, I think many expected this film to run along those tracks. In other words, the presence of Tom Cruise (especially coupled with Cameron Crowe), created very specific expectations, expectations that were unquestionably violated. Now, Tom Cruise did a very good job in this film, but the fact it that because of the expectations surrounding him, he was probably miscast in this film. The film would probably have received a better reception with someone like John Cusack or Johnny Depp in the lead role, actors who have an established quirky side.
I think the other reason that this film has received some negative reactions is the fact that it really, at its heart, is not a happy film. Things don't work out the way that any of the characters in the film would have liked. There is no fairy tale ending. Instead, there is an acknowledgement that life does contain tragedies.
Although this is not a perfect film, it nonetheless is a stimulating, thought provoking fantasy. I loved the way that it continually challenged my sense of reality, and surprised my sensibilities. I loved the look of the film, and I find that many days after having seen it I have a host of extremely vivid images that I continually recall.
So, I strongly recommend this film. But before seeing it, try to imagine that it doesn't star Tom Cruise. You'll have fewer expectations that way.

I didn't go and watch it at the cinema for some stupid reason but recently got the DVD.I've heard mixed opinions of the film,one of my close friends loved it and a few liked it and the rest thought it was ok. Having watched it a few times now,and bought the spanish original and watched that its up there with fight club,usual suspects,seven and meet joe black (strange mix i know).
I think tom cruise is one of the best actors at the moment,along with brad pitt and he is fantastic in this. Penelope Cruz reminds me of a mexican girl i know and this film makes me want to fall in love with her.
After watching it the first time i walked around in a daze with a permanent grin on my face (bit like Tom),wanting to fall in love and dream and also wanting to watch it again straight away.
All i can say is watch it,everyone should before they die. If you like it as much as me then thats great that theres someone else out there who got blown away on the 6 millionth level of heaven like me. If you don't like it then don't put other people off watching it,let them decide cos they might just change after watching it.

1437861,4,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is my favourite ever movie, just pipping Jacob's Ladder to the top spot.  The Jacob's Ladder DVD had a brilliant series of extras.  The best part for me was the deconstruction of the film in the form of a 'making of' featurette.  Vanilla Sky has two similar featurettes, both of which are awful.  One is this press tour thing, and the other is probably the worst documentary I have ever seen.
The original music video 'Africa Shox - Leftfield' was awesome and directed by a great up-and-coming director called Chris Cunningham who no doubt will be making waves in the movie arena soon.  But the DVD version of this music video was awful - just clips fom the film with dodgy editing and effects out of the 80s!!
The good things on the DVD are:
(1) TheFilm
(2) Cameron Crowe's directors commentary which is very insightful.

Not only is the plot engaging, it presents a precipice, an edge where a seemingly romantic movie becomes deeper, engulfing love, dreams, fears, desire into a surreal vision.  To those who dislike the seemless genre mixing, I say that this movie has no exact genre because life can not fit into one classification.  This movie, in a great paradox, is about life through dreams and reality, love and hate.  A great movie to watch over and over, until you understand it one way, and then you see it a new way... a great movie to discuss with friends the meaning you get from it.

The title of my review above is what I got out of it. The entire movie was a dream as some think this life we live is a dream. Sophia was the dreammaker (or god) in this movie not LE. ""Open Your Eyes""
This movie teaches vanity to the max. It also teaches that looks do matter. I think this movie made fun of the audience in the sense that we glorify Hollywood and only love Hollywood actors for what they are..pretty, handsome, rich..rather than who they are..regular individuals put on a pedastal. Finally it teaches that the things we do in this life will affect others.

This film is about conscience, and it is one of those rare films that happens to come out of hollywood every great once in a while. In fact, it is rather unconventional. The ephemeral romance between Cruise and Cruz is subdued and simple, and the moments they share together on the screen are tender without being too sentimental. Who can forget the genuine expression of humility on David's face in the elevator after being told about the possibility of true love with Sofia? The imagery is vivid and lucid, much like the  dream David is in, and the Vanilla Sky near the film's conclusion is eccentric, yet memorable. One could learn much from this film if one keeps an open mind ( hence, Open your eyes ). Finally, Vanilla sky does exactly what it wants: make you think. It makes you think about the importance of little things, the precious nature of love and the consequences we endure because of our actions.

This film brought so many questions to the surface. Do you need money to be happy? Who is the real you? Is it the one face you show to others or is the one face you see of yourself? If you had a second chance, how would you live your life?
Vanilla sky is a movie that makes you think. You must watch it carefully to catch the nuances of each character's attitudes and reactions. Cruise pushes the envelope from happy oblivion to paranoia. Diaz's psychotic stalker scared me with her realism. Cruz played her part as a ""prop"" well. This film didn't do her justice. The surprise character was Kurt Russell. Quite a change from his usual characters.

""Vanilla Sky,"" an entertaining, somewhat clunky drama, offers Tom Terrific the chance to play a vain, super-rich New Yorker who emerges from a near-fatal car crash with a hideously disfigured face. Poor, poor Tom.
The film does manage to hold your interest (Tom loves to ACT for all of us) but only because it is part Hitchcockian allegory, part sc-fi, part psychodrama and part let's see if Tom Terrific could snag an Oscar nomination. Halfway through, it falls apart, but picks itself once once the filmmakers tells what's real, possibly isn't. Dozens of other actors could have played this role, but Tom managed to get it first. That's not a bad thing, but not a good thing either.",1027814400,,749,4.813953488372093

Now when I rented it I couldn't wait to pop it into my DVD player and watch it. About 10 minutes into the movie I was like, ""This is sssoooo dumb!"". Then at about 20 mins into the film I was hooked! This film is fantastic. I have never seen a film by Cameron Crowe and I'm glad I did.
Tom Cruise gives a great performance as David Ames. Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Jason Lee all also give fantastic performances. Cameron Crowe did a great job with putting the film together. This film is in the top 10 best films of the year. Its simply amazing. The DVD is also great. The picture quality is one of the best I have seen and the sound is unbeliveibly clear and crisp. I haven't watched the special features yet but they look really good.
Vanilla Sky is about a young wealthy magazine owner(Cruise) whos life is going great. Cameron Diaz plays the woman who loves him beyond belief and follows him everywhere. When David Ames meets Sophia(Cruz) he falls for her and spends the night with her. When he leaves Diaz is there asks him if he wants to take a ride. He goes and everything is fine until she starts questioning him on why he spent the night with her. She starts speeding at 80 mph and flys off a bridge. Diaz killed herself but Ames lives but is horribly disfigured.
Will Ames ever come back to normal???? Will he ever have a life??? I know the answers but I won't tell becuase you don't want to know the end before you see it. This film is fantastic.

1437910,4,B00005JKMY,"this is seriously one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life, by far cameron crowe's greatest in my opinion.  first of all i can understand how some people may feel that the ending is a ""cop-out"" & that crowe spoon feeds the audience the entire resolution at the very end all at once.  but if you really think about it, it all fits together perfectly.  david (cruise) is supposed to be just as confused as the audience & his sudden acquisition of the whole truth goes hand in hand w/ his ""final awakening.""  so i think the strategy here is to make david more believable & to help the audience sympathize w/ him in the midst of all the bewildering chaos.  some people don't like how the film has a choppy, frantic, urgent feel to it.  but his perception of his life is a nightmare & nightmares usually are that way.  it's amazing how profound this movie is, how many levels it has.  it speculates on the future well-being of mankind b/c of new developments in technology & questions the scientific ethics of ""playing God"" by bringing people back from the dead, which is a very real situation that is being thoroughly researched today.  it tells us to appreciate the little things in life, everything, even the bad b/c suffering allows us to appreciate our blessings.  it tells us to appreciate these things b/c we never know when the consequences of the decisions we make will turn our whole life around in a matter of moments & possibly face us w/ our own mortality, the mortality that makes us human.  david wasn't happy w/ the events of his real life, so he decides to sculpt a ""perfect"" dream, but it goes horribly wrong b/c nothing about life is perfect.  you can't live in a dream.  he realizes this in the end & that's why he chooses to wake up from his dream.  he wants to be ""real"" again.  i love this movie so much b/c it's so philosophical; it's got something to say to its audience.  it says to ""open our eyes"" & see things for how they really are.  sorry for all the rambling, but i guess i'm a hippie at heart.  much applause to alexander amenabar & cameron crowe.",1027555200,,2092,4.375647668393782

Crowe filled this movie with everything, flashy scenery, a ridiculous plot, and most importantly... one of the best soundtracks every put together. I'll admit it, one of the reasons this movie works is because of the music. Crowe knows the exact song that needs to be put in a scene for it to work, and he does this throughout the entire movie.

1437912,1,B00005JKMY,"After his career-high achievement Almost Famous, it boggles the mind how Cameron Crowe managed to plunge into the abyss that is Vanilla Sky.
Without a shred of coherence or a single believable major performance in sight, Vanilla Sky is a vain, pretentious, schizophrenic descent into narrative chaos.  Tom Cruise's lead performance is bereft even of his usual boyish charisma; Penelope Cruz discards her dramatic ability (shown mostly in her Spanish films); and Cameron Diaz looks and acts miserably, possibly sensing a bad career move.
The plot makes no sense and the middle drags horrendously; there comes a point where the ""story"" -- whatever there is of it -- stops completely and we're stuck with Tom Cruise struggling to convey psychological horror.  But unlike, say, Dario Argento or David Fincher, Cameron Crowe is not a visually based filmmaker.  His calling card is his usually sharp writing, and Vanilla Sky abandons that for a vague series of visuals without any guiding force.  There is never any sense of danger, mystique or malaise in the film, just endless scenes of characters brooding and self-pitying -- hardly the stuff of good movies.
The only redeeming factor is the gorgeous photography, courtesy of Oscar-nominated cinematographer John Toll (Almost Famous, The Thin Red Line).  It's a pity Crowe doesn't come up with anything emotionally or intellectually worthy of the imagery, so it all remains lovely eye candy that provides only blank calories.  Oh, and underrated actress Alicia Witt (Fun) makes a cameo, if that matters at all.  When not even the magnificent Tilda Swinton can save your film, you're really in trouble.

Tom Cruise has done much better films with director Cameron Crowe. (Like Jerry McGuire) He also shines in Risky Business, Top Gun, A Few Good Men and even Legend is much better than this one. What was he thinking when he read this script?

i get it... it's kinda cute... i think the concept for the movie is excellent... i jus cant get into the actual performances that the actors give us.
this movie isn't 'confusing' as much as it is 'dis-jointed' and that kept me from gettin emotionally attached to any of the characters displayed here.
tom cruise's face remains covered for much of this movie so i cant say his 'acting' prevailed and carried me thru the flaws.
penelope cruz wasn't given enough screen time...
cameron diaz almost has that 'glenn close quality' with this; more of her 'spurned lover' routine woulda been nice.
kurt russell gives a descent performance but nothing to brag about, i liked him better in 'big, trouble in little china' (uh-oh, are yall using my taste in that movie to rationalize my opinions now? probably!).
overall, this is a very well-made average movie... anyone wanting to compare this to the works of classic writers (such as kafka) proly doesnt read enough... no movie that i have ever seen has ever compared to the book it is related to (hopefully, tom hank's 'road to perdition' will break that trend).

(The ""empty Times Square"" scene, in particular, is surprising and shocking.) The more intimate moments reveal an intriguing protagonist David Aames (Tom Cruise) who is dragged from arrogant complacency to bewilderment and confusion through a series of ever more outrageous incidents. Cruise is surprisingly convincing in the role, moving from his more typical sunny, confident extrovert persona, through to deeper, more conflicted & ambivalent individual, as the story develops.
The plot is indeed (deliberately) complex and shocking. The strands only come together at movie's end, in a somewhat unsatisfying ""Matrix""-like conclusion.

1437944,3,B00005JKMY,"There's a great performance in ""Vanilla Sky,"" but it's not by Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee or even His Most Imperial Majesty Emperor Thomas Cruise Mapother IV. It's by Kurt Russell, playing Cruise's psychiatrist. Unfortunately, you have to describe the plot in detail to say why Russell's performance is so effective, and that would take more space than I have here, not to mention that divulging the plot of ""Vanilla Sky"" to anyone who hasn't seen it should be punishable by guillotine. Let's just say that when Russell learns the secret of the plot, his air of gentle resignation is more moving than anything else in the picture. NONE of the critics mentioned Russell in their reviews--except to say he was in the movie--and those who post here are saying things like, ""EVEN Kurt Russell shines in this movie."" This is all too typical of Russell's career. He acted Cher off the screen in ""Silkwood,"" but guess who got the Oscar nomination?
  And ""Vanilla Sky"" itself? It has a number of dazzling set pieces, and it's certainly worth seeing, but it doesn't hold together in the end. Again, you would have to describe too much of the plot to say why it doesn't work; I would note, however, that it's kind of galling that Jason Lee's character is described at the end as a ""true friend"" to Tom Cruise's, when his actions throughout--even when you sort out actual vs. illusory actions--show him to be anything but. Cameron Crowe, that sanest and most humane of directors, has the technical prowess to bring off the special effects here, but the crazed, misanthropic tone of the movie plays him for a loss. Cruise also has some brilliant moments, but it becomes plain before the movie is half-over that ""Vanilla Sky"" is a Tom Cruise vanity production, with the other performers allowed to shine intermittently only by the sufferance of the star. That Russell comes across so strongly--in a very quiet performance, yet--is a great tribute to a much underrated actor. I would recommend ""Minority Report"" over ""Vanilla Sky."" Steven Spielberg is enough of a star (and control freak) in his own right to glide over plot holes and keep Tom Cruise's ego in check.",1026604800,,2163,4.811827956989247

Now before anyone leaps on me for missing the point - yes I understand it was supposed to be a complex plot, with twists and turns. But does that mean we needed to have a story where you had to not only suspend disbelief, you had to throw it out the window completely!
[Plot spoilers coming up - Go no further if you intend to watch the movie - I warned you]
Excuse me, but if you're in cryogenic suspension - you do not dream (no matter how much money you have. Now if it had been a coma, maybe I wouldn't have been so outraged.
The complete spoiler for this movie though is the poor character development. Are we really supposed to dislike Tom Cruise's role as much as I did? It was one of those movies that not only did I dislike the ending - I didn't care anyway. I just wanted the movie to end so I could say I'd seen it and relegate it to the 'Don't bother watching again pile'.
Don't get me wrong, I like complex material. But this was not like a 'Thirteenth Floor', 'What dreams may come' or anything like it. I gave this movie 2 stars (rather than none) simply because its one of those movies that many people will tell you was brilliant - you therefore have to see it yourself and make your own mind up.

First off, the plot is terrible.  There are so many flashbacks and flash-forwards going on that it seems like a bad Pulp Fiction clone.  Add to that the extra twists from Cruise's character suddenly having scenes that completely contradict other scenes in the film, and you're left with an experience that essentially has your face locked in a perpetual ""what the heck is going on"" look.  I'm an educated person and like to think that I can handle plot twists, but this was even too much for me.
It's definitely not a film where you'll fall asleep, but it's one where you have to fight the urge to say that the money you spent just isn't worth the time you'll be watching this lemon.

The film is brilliant:  there's a great cast that fits perfectly with a beautiful but complicated story about dreams and reality and what could happen if you lost yourself within the two.  Penelope Cruz is so beautiful and lovable in this movie, and Tom gives an astonishing performance.  Not to mention Jason Lee, of whom I am a big fan.
I can't even upt into words how this movie made me feel from start to finish.  Right from the beginning I fell completely in love with it, and the film's soundtrack (which is one of the best I have ever heard).  I truly wish that more people could watch the movie from a more open perspective to truly appreciate its beauty.  I don't mean to sound cheesy, but the film was definitely one of the best I've seen this year.  It was probably my favorite.

Viewers must wait until the last segment to find something of interest, but by then we have lost interest enough to cease caring.

1438018,5,B00005JKMY,"I actually ordered this film on a wim, I had heard a little something from my friend Zach. But it was little more than ""Vanilla Sky was cool..."" So while bored, I ordered the film.
At first, I was a little taken back. But ten minutes into the film, I was in awe. Little things, stood out to me. Listening to David (Tom) and the changing of his character throughout the story, almost makes watching it worth wild.
Now I won't say it didn't have flaws, or that this film is for everyone. For it most certainly is not, this movie isn't for someone who is looking for a quick, understanding plot and kisses and hugs for an ending. the ending DOES leave possibilities, but there is also your lingering. ""Why couldn't?"", before I continue, a basic outline of the film.
David Aames (Tom Cruise) is wealthy, has a wonderful ""Girlfriend"", and almost anything he wants. When he meets Sofia, (Penelope Cruise) he starts a somewhat blossoming relationship when his world shatters... Julie (Cameron Diaz) his earlier ""Girlfriend"" takes David on a drive, aiming for a two way suicide. She explains to him she loved him, and that she is not just a sex plaything. He tries to console, but in the end, she crashes the vehicle. Julia dies, while David lives. But in a horribly disfigured shape, he then moves on and regains companionship with Sofia.
As the story progresses, you will see David and Malkave (Kurt Russel) discussing a murder and David's involvement.
In the end, things are summed up fairly well. And the whole story is rather fascinating and deserves a second or third watching to fully understand. All and all, this film is for someone who is willing to watch a film for the FILM itself. Who is willing to pay attention, and dedicate themself to that two hours and sixteen minutes. And appreciate everything it has to offer, with that I leave you with this...

The two documentary shorts by Cameron Crowe that are included on the DVD are extremely helpful in appreciating what Crowe, Cruise, Cruz and Diaz were trying to accomplish in this film.  I never saw the original ""Abre Los Ojos"", but I am extremely curious after having viewed this interpretation of the story.
This film is not for those who watch movies for ""entertainment"" this movie is definitely for those who like to have an experience when they watch a film.  This movie makes you think and challenges the viewer to find the meaning for his/herself.

The storyline at FIRST is somewhat hard to follow but at the end of the movie it all comes together and all the blanks are filled in. The second viewing of this film seems to be even better. Overall this movie is a great story and it shows how money and power are not needed in love, and what counts are the feelings deep down inside of the individual.",1026086400,,519,4.416666666666667
1438021,4,B00005JKMY,"Based on the Spanish movie Abre Los Ojos aka Open Your Eyes, Vanilla Sky is different, but as equally compelling as the original.
Vanilla Sky copies several scenes right out of the original movie. There are parts that are eerily similar, especially with Sofia being played by the same actress who played her originally, yet there are several different parts as well. Vanilla Sky is more lengthy, and goes into more detail with everything.
The Times Square scene was brilliant, and even more fascinating than the one shot by Amenabar (the director of Open Your Eyes) in the original, partly because Times Square is something that exists closer to home, rather than something in far off Spain. Eerily shot, it features the entire Times Square in New York empty, with not a single person in sight, and is a brilliant setup to the rest of the movie.
While Vanilla Sky has many similarities to the original, the most fascinating thing I found was that two things made experiencing Vanilla Sky totally different from experiencing Open Your Eyes for me. The first was the lighting. In the original, the lighting is very dark, and chilling, and the movie has a very dark thriller tone to it. But Vanilla Sky is shot with brilliantly bright colors that make the entire movie glow with a certain vibe and energy, and that exist to make the movie sometimes even more chilling in its own right. The second was the music. While the first featured a deep and amazing score by Amenabar, this second featured many pop culture references, and a more modern sound to it - something that Cameron Crowe is known for. These two factors make the two movies entirely different, but in both cases, they enhance the experience.
The mystery tone itself is hard for me to judge, partly because seeing the original took out all the mystery in Vanilla Sky anyway. But even without having a sense of mystery for me to judge, it was still a stunningly original experience, and one which had me engrossed in the entire movie.
It didn't hurt either that Cameron Diaz had what was one of the best performances of 2001. There is always a certain moment in a brilliant performance that defines the entire role, a certain scene in which I can only describe as a spark, a place where the actor/actress connects with the audience. Fionnula Flanagan had it when she regally gave the keys to Nicole Kidman in The Others, Kate Hudson had it when she was torn between crying and laughing in Almost Famous, Naomi Watts had it in her audition in Mulholland Dr, and now, Cameron Diaz had it when she laughed and looked into the camera with those almost maddening and insane eyes in Vanilla Sky. The rest of the cast was also stellar as always, though I would have liked to see more of Kurt Russell as the psychiatrist at the end of this movie.
Many will interpret this film differently. Some will take the ending literally and utterly without question. Others may interpret this in an entire other way. There are at least three main paths that someone could argue this movie takes, and as the director said, every one of them could be right.
All in all, Vanilla Sky is one of the more intelligent, compelling, and fascinating movies of 2001. I am glad to say that Vanilla Sky is a piece of art in its own right, as equally colorful and vivid as the Monet painting hanging in David's apartment.",1026000000,2,3347,4.6268907563025214
1438022,1,B00005JKMY,"What a piece of pretentious garbage Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise have served up here!
I loved ""Almost Famous,"" and have enjoyed many of Crowe's other films.  I'm not a big Cruise fan, but he's been good in some films, including ""Jerry McGuire."" Notwithstanding, it wouldn't have been a shock if this movie was merely mediocre.  But it's way worse than that.  It's positively hideous.
The movie wants you to care about the fate of a spoiled brat, whose struggle throughout the movie is his yearning desire to remain a spoiled brat, and not grow up. And although the storytelling is murky to say the least, it appears, at the end, that against all odds, he remains a spoiled brat.  You're supposed to be happy about this outcome, because in between being a spoiled brat at the beginning and a spoiled brat at the end, the character apparently suffers.  But he suffers in the most undignified, obnoxious way!  Cruise's character has friends and lovers, but you can't see why.  They aren't golddiggers, though in the real world, a guy like Cruise would only be surrounded by golddiggers and yes men.  These friends are presented as being people of depth, but the very fact that they fight so hard to remain his friends makes you question their sanity.  There is simply nothing to recommend this guy, nothing that would inspire loyalty in a normal person.
My sense is that success has ruined Crowe.  He's lost touch with what his audience would find compelling, and has run out of things to say.  So instead you get a lot of psuedo-inventive filmmaking and non-linear storytelling, and a lot of retro-psychedelic party and nightclub scenes, and some third-rate X Files type paranoia, which may seem very interesting to a jaded, overpaid, overpraised media hypester, but mean nothing, nothing, nothing to the audience.  I've yet to find anyone who liked this movie.",1026000000,10,1859,4.829652996845426
1438023,5,B00005JKMY,"Against my better judgment, I'm going to enter the fray.  Apparently Vanilla Sky doesn't offer much of a middle ground.  This is one of those films that people either love, or hate.
Recently my wife went out to rent a couple of DVDs and returned with Vanilla Sky.  Since I am not a Tom Cruise fan, I was disappointed.  I was prepared to do something more interesting like clipping my toenails, or re-organizing my toolbox, while she watched this movie.  Ultimately, she did not enjoy Vanilla Sky, my toenails didn't get clipped that night, and my toolbox is still a mess.  Apparently if my wife's reaction, coupled with the response from other reviewers, is any indication, Vanilla Sky tends to appeal more to non-fans than fans of Tom Cruise.

If your goal is pure entertainment, or if you want to sit back in your chair and go along for the ride, this movie is not for you.  It's not simply a spectacle.  To understand and enjoy this movie, you must participate, you must think.  While not completely predictable, this film contains frequent clues and hints regarding its outcome.
Vanilla Sky is beautifully filmed, and includes remarkable performances from Cruise and Cruz.  Tom Cruise (As David Aames) is forced to act without the benefit of his famous good looks for perhaps only the second time in his career.  He delivers an emotional performance that is pact with charisma and depth.  You cannot help but fall in love with Penilope Cruz as Sophia.  Kurt Russell was definitely well cast as Dr. McCabe (A psychiatrist who also appears to function as a spiritual guide for Cruise).  Personally, I believe this movie's greatest flaw was the casting of Cameron Diaz as Julie Gianni.  While the casting of Diaz may have been good for the box office, her performance was weak, childish, and consistently broke the pace of the movie.
Vanilla Sky inspired me to run out and purchase ""Abre Los Ojos"" (Open Your Eyes), the Spanish film by Alejandro Amenabar.  For those few readers that don't know, Vanilla Sky is a remake of Abre Los Ojos.  I've read and heard criticisms of Vanilla Sky as it compares to the original.  One frequent comparison between the two films is that Vanilla Sky ""over does it"", especially when Tom Cruise's David Aames is compared to Eduardo Noriega's Cesar.  While David Aames is the extremely wealthy head of a New York publishing firm (To a small extent David Aames struck me as a JFK JR type), Cesar is a moderately wealthy partner in a catering company (US extravagance vs. European moderation).  In both versions of the story our protagonists clearly have access to the finest physicians available, and they can afford the ultimate solution depicted in this film.  Regardless of any reall or imagined differences between US and Spanish health care costs, and the diferences between lifestyles depicted, in a nutshell both characters must have access to great wealth.  Frankly, I don't believe that an American audience would accept that the owner of even a large catering company would have access to the kind of wealth that would make this story plausible.  Also, the David Aames position in society adds another dimension to this film.  Do you have friends, or just people who need something from you?  While both are essentially the same films, they were created for different target audiences.  Both films stand on an equally firm footing.",1026000000,2,3372,4.84965034965035
1438024,1,B00005JKMY,I have never written a review before but this movie was so disappointing I felt that I had to begin now. The main reason that I felt so strongly was the fact that Vanilla Sky is a remake of a very good movie called Open Your Eyes. Vanilla Sky while not straying from the story failed miserably on all levels of movie making. Cameron Crowes use of rock songs for the soundtrack missed the mark and his rewrite of the script just missed the whole essence of the movie and the characters. I recommend Open Your Eyes which has Penelope Cruz also over Vanilla Sky 100% but it is in spanish and you have to read subtitles but it is worth it.,1026000000,16,635,4.213114754098361
1438025,5,B00005JKMY,"I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Tom Cruise proves himself to be a gifted actor, the angelic Penelope Cruz is delightful, Cameron Diaz is great; even Kurt Russell shines in his role.  So many people complain about Hollywood, deriding the fact that today's movies are unoriginal, yet many folks don't seem to appreciate a truly ""different"" movie when it comes along.  I know, this is a remake of the Spanish Obre las Ojos, yet it does represent something unique among recent American releases.  I can also understand why some people may be confused about the movie as the story progresses, but I found it quite understandable by the end.  The issues this movie addresses are ""deep,"" but they get to the heart of life and existence for the individual soul.  Reality, dreams, desires, disappointments--these are the determiners of life itself, and any movie that can really make you think about your own life and existence in a serious manner wins my highest praises.  I won't even talk about the plot of this movie here--this movie has to be experienced; it cannot be explained.  Don't worry about where the movie is going; just enjoy the ride.  I would urge the viewer to devote a full 130 minutes to watching it; if you pause it to talk to your neighbor or mess around in the kitchen, you run the risk of losing comprehension and rob yourself of the spectacular aura this movie wraps around you.
This strikes me as rather a bold career move for Tom Cruise, especially given the fact that his character has his face disfigured in an accident.  Of course, there could be no better way for him to define himself as a great actor.  I love Penelope Cruz--her beauty is matched by a mesmerizing air of mystery which plays incredibly well in this particular motion picture.  As for the DVD's special features, they are OK but not exceptional.  There is a seven-minute mini-feature about the making of the movie--it doesn't really give any secrets away, but I would definitely watch it only after viewing the movie.  Another mini-feature provides us with glimpses of the worldwide tour by Cruise, Cruz, and director Cameron Crowe.  The interview with Paul McCartney is short and sweet, and I must admit that I didn't realize that he had contributed the ""title song"" to the movie until I watched the interview.  Even if there were no extras, Vanilla Sky is definitely a movie worth owning.  While I have only watched it once, the intricacies of the plot make this a prime candidate for the mantle of rewatchability.  If you approach this movie with an open mind and let the story absorb you into its unique world, I do not see how you can walk away disappointed.",1025913600,3,2653,4.718004338394794
1438056,1,B00005JKMY,"Do NOT buy this movie under any circumstances -- don't even rent it.  To do so would be to encourage an otherwise very talented group of people to make another overly-hyped waste of time.  First clue that it's a stinker: we rented three ""new release"" videos -- the other two were due back in two days; the video store didn't want this one back for a week.  Second clue: the star is also the producer.  Third clue: at the main menu (on the DVD), the first selection to play is not the movie itself, but a 10-minute hype piece about how great the movie is and about how wonderful the cast and crew are.
The movie starts out very promisingly, but slides steadily downhill.  For those pseudo-intellectuals who believe there's some profound meaning to this movie; you probably also think the emperor has clothes.  After watching this beautifully filmed mess, we thought the special features might shed some light on what was going on in the minds of those who make this movie.  Alas, there were no clues, but the promo piece did mention that the crew still gets together and talks about all the ""layers"" of the movie.  Translation: even they don't have the foggiest idea of what they made, and they're trying to convince you to buy the movie anyway.

1438057,2,B00005JKMY,"I am a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I must be honest.  I did not enjoy Vanilla Sky.  The story line flip flopped between dream, therapy and reality...which left me quite confused until the very end.  Curiosity is what kept me hangin on...wanting to know what's the point?  At any rate Cruise plays David, a handsome and rich womanizer.  His womanizing gets him into serious life altering situations.  The only thing that stayed on my mind from this movie was the statement that his sex buddy (who was really in love by herself) made, ""When you sleep with someone your body makes a promise whether you do or not!""",1025740800,2,608,4.532110091743119
1438058,5,B00005JKMY,"... for an increadible journey. Vanilla Sky is so sad, so true, so brilliant. I saw the original, which is raw, sloppy with a lot of mediocre choices and solutions. Vanilla Sky is a beautiful tale, a message so rarely received: ... well, I shouldn't tell my version, it's best told in the movie.
I join the long line before me: I never was a fan or admirer of Tom Cruise. That all had changed with Magnolia. In Vanilla Sky, both him and Cruz act so credibly, they redefine and reset the standards of acting in a few minutes of the movie at the end and after that very night they spend together. Their expressions are so subtle, their sadness is so true that it's hard to believe it is ""just"" acting. Well... the love story part isn't as we know.
Last note: This is a good case study comparing Open Your Eyes and Vanilla Sky. The latter is modern, easy to connect to and to be moved by, the original misses the point: the audience. E.g., showing someone angry doens't make the viewer angry, it makes them uncomfortable. What's wrong with contemporary European art?Trying to make a profit on a movie is not a sin. It may even help the cause, gives you a ""down-to-Earth"" attitude.

Well, unfortunately, it gets to be too deep for its own good.  You think that you understand what's going on after the car crash that Cruise's character, David, gets into, but eventually it turns into a big spinning illusion with women that are dead, alive, carrying two different names and faces and doing it all at the same time.  A good movie with this kind of plot line allows the viewer to piece together the confusion in their own way that somehow gets them to the end of the movie, but in the case of Vanilla Sky you'll want to punch the wall in anger because they do such a bad job of confusing you.  Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz are outstanding, particulary Cruz, who steals the show with her spunkyness and beauty.  What's more, though, is how Cameron Crowe (who I'm very dissapointed in, after the wonderful Almost Famous) tries to make this a sci-fi movie, with cryogenically freezing companies that prolong life, a la Austin Powers.

1438060,5,B00005JKMY,"Like other non conventional movies before it, ""Vanilla Sky"" takes a few viewings before its true impact sinks in.
Once it does, you realize the film is a multi-textured masterpiece that offers,underneath it's bizarre style and fractured time structure, a number of deeply felt life lessons about love, friendship, sex and dreams.
Tom Cruise gives the best performance of his career (the scene in which he phones Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and leaves the ""our old friend 'Benny the Dog' message on her machine, is perhaps Cruise's finest piece of acting to date..
The monolouge given by Cruise's Life Extention Tech Support representative (brilliantly played by Noah Taylor) in which Taylor explains how Cruise's dream life was fashioned by the pop culture icons of his youth, is moviemaking at its finest.
The entire supporting cast (Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Kurt Russell) is simply sensational.
I've avoiding discussing actual details of the plot since ""Vanilla Sky"" is a movie that has to be seen and digested to be fully appreciated.
Cameron Crowe directs from his own screenplay (based on the Spanish film ""Abre Los Ojos"") and does a masterful job.
The properly eclectic soundtrack features, among others, Bob Dylan, REM, Paul Mc Cartney, Radiohead and the Beach Boys.

Another friend of mine told me it's reminiscent of The Matrix and Dark City in terms of questioning reality, so I took in Vanilla Sky not knowing what to expect, and I was happily surprised at the results.  Tom Cruise plays a self-conceited, wealthy, handsome, playboy who has the world at his fingertips (he's really playing himself), but one day his world comes crashing down when he is left horribly scarred and disfigured in a car crash involving his suicidal ex-lover played devilishly by Cameron Diaz.  Eventually, his face is seemingly repaired by a miracle of new age plastic surgery, and he is reunited with his one true love played by Penelope Cruz.  But soon, things start falling apart even more so, and Cruise discovers that all is not what it seems, and there is a higher power in control.  Tom Cruise is rather good in this film, as is the other Cruz, both of whom give off great chemistry together, and Jason Lee (alumnus of many of Kevin Smith's films) is good as Cruise's best friend, but I thought that Kurt Russel was wasted in his role.  All in all though, the ending of the film may have been the biggest flaw, which is why some people absolutely hated the film, and while Vanilla Sky isn't perfect by any means, it is clearly worth a look.",1025568000,4,1422,4.556862745098039

What is good about ""Vanilla Sky"" is that it is a brilliant;y crafted and hypnotic piece of filmmaking. Cameron Crowe has proved himself to be a director of great visual style. The film has many recurring motifs and literary allusions, which make it interesting on several different levels. The acting is good. Tom Cruise is genuinely convincing and creepy as a man gone over the edge, and Penelope Cruz is diverting as the woman of his dreams. Cameron Diaz plays the psychotic and wounded Julie to perfection. Indeed, her performance is a big reason to see the film. The romance between Cruise and Cruz is involving and their chemistry convincing.
The labrynthine plot of ""Vanilla Sky"" is creative and diverting, but about halfway through, I had lost interest. Despite good direction and great acting, it becomes more and more difficult to care how it all ends. The ending, when it does come, explains everything...almost. My big problem with ""Vanilla Sky"" is that the explanation to all that has occurred is so ridiculous and unlikely. It is far too simplified and destroys all of the delicious ambiguity that the previous two hours have built up.
""Vanilla Sky"" is a good film, but it is not a great one. I do recommend it, though. It takes several viewing to pick up all of its nuances, its textures. Just skip the ending.",1025395200,,1598,4.751798561151079
1438065,2,B00005JKMY,"For those that need the movie explained to you, don't worry. It's New Age psychobabble and New Agers probably fell for it.  Tom pulled you in and you fell for it.  The whole time I am watching this movie, I see Tom's ""religious"" views.  I thought the movie was entertaining and that was it.  It is not deep, it is not artsy.  If Tom was giving you a story about God, most of you would hate it.  However, Tom pulls you in to his religious views by disguising it with a movie.  Here is how it goes, Tom, er, the movie has you believe that you are in total control of your life.  Mistakes you make will be a learning experience for your next life.  Each life is a series of learning events.  Therefore, you are only responsible for yourself.  The bad things you do will guide your next series of life.  This is the nonsense that this movie dictates.  Like I said, if Tom was trying to give a Christian perspective, many would be offended.  Many would curse Tom for pushing his religious views on the public.  That is exactly what he has done here.  You see, there is nothing artsy about it.  He took his quirky religious views and put it on the big screen.
Many ""intellects"" give it a five star because they actually fall for it.  These are the same people who think any movie is a great movie if it is completely in French and has subtitles.
As far as acting is concerned, Tom does an OK job.  He is not anywhere near Guy Pierce, Brad Pitt, Russell Crowe, Tom Hankes and just about everyone else except for Keanu Reeves and Sly Stallone. Kurt Russell is Kurt Russell.  Penelope Cruz doesn't have to act, so that leaves Cameron Diaz.  She actually steals the movie.  I think she did a pretty good job.",1025308800,5,1698,4.290220820189274
1438096,5,B00005JKMY,"Watching this after viewing the convoluted mess, MULHOLLAND DR., was like a breath of fresh air. Here is a convoluted film with BIG IDEAS and an actual pay-off at the end. AND IT'S FUNNY!! Some [people] claim this movie made no sense and was full of holes. Huh? The whole thing is spelled out in it's conclusion. Cameron Crowe practically leads you by the hand. ... Having seen this PSYCHOLOGICAL MASTERPIECE 3 times so far, I couldn't find a single hole in it's superbly delineated plot.
Not being a fan of Penelope Cruz or Cameron Diaz, I went into this film with low expectations. I was wrong. Cruise and Cruz have great chemistry together. Obviously because of their off- screen chemistry. And Cameron Diaz' performance is chilling. I have a newfound respect for her. Next to BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY, this is Tom's best performance by far. He says, it's his favorite film to date. No kidding!! His performance is sad, hilarious, and profoundly touching. BRAVO!! Jason Lee is always great and he's a riot in this film. Hope to be seeing more of him, now that he's mainstream. Kurt Russell in a marvelously understated role.

... Granted what at first appears to be a psychological thriller, which it is, ultimately becomes a science fiction odyssey of the mind. [For those] who couldn't understand why Tom Cruise gets in the car with Cameron Diaz: Diaz offers Cruise sex. This is the important choice that Cruise makes which ultimately changes his whole life and the direction or conflict of the story. And he doesn't ""punch her in the face"" because he's trying to talk her down. ... It's about the male libido. It's about thinking with one's head and not one's.....ahem. ""It's about choices"" is stated several times in the film. As for the identities changing during Cruise's nightmare nothing could be more obvious: his subconscious is playing out his tortured feelings of guilt about Cameron Diaz' character. ""The subconscious is a powerful thing"" is stated several times in the film. Psychology 101. Pretty simple stuff when you see it unfolding. ...  As for comparing this to MEMENTO: OK, a psychological thriller with an unusual timeline device. But MEMENTO had a fill-in-the-blank pay-off. What was the motivation behind it all? Why was this guy manipulating this other guy's mind? We'll never know. Doesn't really matter. These two films are pretty far apart in their intentions.
This script could have come from the mind of Phillip K. Dick- sheer paranoia, except for the ending, which is full of redemption and hope. Stunningly put together and masterfully directed by Cameron Crowe. The music is wonderful. One expects the music in a film such as this to be haunting and weird, ala David Lynch, but the choice of tunes is a reflection of the main character's taste in music. GOOD VIBRATIONS?- man, that was out of left field.
 The DVD format is artfully done and the extras are good, although the MAKING OF segment, PRELUDE TO A DREAM, could have been more extensive. DO NOT watch PRELUDE TO A DREAM before watching the film. It gives away a part of the plot ... You do get a COMMENTARY by the film maker which I haven't clicked on yet.
Not as psychologically disturbing as FIGHT CLUB, but close.
Wow, I thought the meaning of this MASTERPIECE was fairly obvious, but after reading some of the other reviews, I guess I have to say, go into this one with an OPEN MIND.
BRILLIANT!! Thanks, Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise, for helping to restore my faith in Hollywood. This movie is one of the reason's why I love film. One of the 2 or 3 best films of 2001.",1025308800,18,3568,4.714743589743589

I love Cameron Crowe, his other works are so much better than this one. But still... this movi was decent. It wasn't HORRIBLE, it was decent. Is the DVD worth buying? Thats a hard thing to say. A lot of people have different tastes so I wouldn't know if you wanted to buy it or not.
I for one want to buy it. I guess you should rent it then buy it, if you liked it of course.
I thought the menues were great. They were well beyond great. I just love the menues. And the movie, I could point out the flaws but then i would max out the maximum number of words I have. So. I'm just going to tell you the good things, the pro's. The actors did a good job. Tom Cruise, as always, he was very good. Cameron Diaz, she really convinced me in her little psycho-traumatic state. Penelope Cruz... well, lets just say she should definitely stick to Spanish films. At least then she had respect.
The script was great, i thought. so... well yeah. i guess it was a good movie. MINDBLOWING ENDING. so many little clues throughout the movie that most people take for granted. the ending was great. it was just great. i mean the movie overall was decent and its a great disc.

1438101,3,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is truly unique in its own ways of capturing one's imagination. But what the producers and writers failed to overlook was the plethora of plot twists that confused more than half of its viewers. In all of my critiques of films, I have found this movie to truly be the hardest. Although the film was confusing, its plot was very thought through and one can tell that it took many intellectuals to bring forth such a complex storyline. One's realization at the conclusion of the film was intriguing, but in a way contradicting. Certain parts of the plot seemed to be twisted with others; which lets its viewers wait through the boredom of the untwisting plot which seemed to never come clear. The casting and soundtrack were all top notch, but this movie is definitely one would have to watch a few more times to incorporate it's plethora of twists. In my opinion, plot twists can truly make a film shine in glory, but Vanilla Sky's twists were disorganized and confused too many viewers. People were so confused at the end of the movie that they dismissed it as ""the worst and confusing movie I've ever seen"". The plot's goal was top-notch, but the twists and turns broke the movie's chance of survival off the hinge.
Pros:
1. Excellent Soundtrack
2. Top-Notch Casting
3. Intriguing plot that was meticulously thought through with pristine intellect.
Cons:
1. Easily looses the common viewer's understanding.
2. Plot twists came in great numbers and were disorganized.
3. Simplicity can overrule complexity when a film's plot is at judgment.",1025049600,,1552,4.838345864661654

The last fifteen minutes make everything transparently clear. What's the mystery? Then you look back and see the brilliance of everything that transpired before. And Tom Cruise gives perhaps his best performance ever. Granted, watching the movie can be disturbing. But the ending provides full redemption and an appreciation for everything that happened earlier.",1024963200,5,694,5.205357142857143
1438103,4,B00005JKMY,"... you'll find this surreal dreamscape of a movie by Cameron Crowe. A bit longish, but fascinating nonetheless, ""Vanilla Sky"" takes its title from a painting by Monet, which is significant, but not crucial to understanding or enjoying this American remake of Alejandro Amenabar's ""Abre Los Ojos.""
Both my wife and I found this to be a far better movie than ""Mulholland Drive,"" which we watched a few weeks earlier. It's not perfect, and there's at least one glaring plot/structure flaw -- why would Aames choose to make his ""splice"" when he does, rather than earlier? -- but the film holds your interest and provides some food for thought.

Open your eyes...didn't you see the ""Van Gogh"" painting in the beginning of the movie??? That was the kicker for me.  It was so symbolic, how could it be missed?  Create your own sky...create a fantasy.  The opening scenes lead you into the movie's blueprint.

  Simple as pie..the plot (which obviously I can not go into detail about.)  My review, I hope will open the mind of someone wanting to rent it, but sees so many negative reviews.  Watch it...If you have a sense of life and an imagination...you'll like it.  The cast is the only thing I did not like..I had no problem with a plot that took some above average intellect or the ending that required at least three solid seconds to sink in...(It isn't Star Wars).It wasn't intended to be an adrenaline flick, but rather a puzzle.  Penelope Cruz just gets on my nerves a bit.  She's so mousy and seeing her act beside a powerhouse like Cameron Diaz just exaggerated her lack of believable acting skills.
  On the best side..some directors just KNOW how to leave their mark...this is one of them. Reminds me of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" with his signature lighting effects...(also seen in ""Aliens"") Crowe has his own thumbprint too.  The movie has that Cameron Crowe and possible dash of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" feel to it.  Felt like an ""Ode"" to that other famous fabulous director.
I loved it.  Watching it twice made the ending even more phenomenal.  You have been warned...see all those negative reviews? Who cares...if you enjoy Lewis Caroll...you might like this one.  If you are looking for instant gratification..wait for ""Minority Report"".  Vanilla Sky needs to be savored with all its intensity.  If you like this movie..check out ""Run Lola Run"".

1438137,4,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is a visually and intellectually fascinating film that many viewers and critics found too confusing to enjoy. What starts out as a surreal mystery turns out to be an exploration into the nature of reality. In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films where the characters are never sure what is real and what is a dream (or computer-generated fantasy). Vanilla Sky also has some David Lynch-like features, as when people's identities seem to randomly morph. Unlike Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive, however, Cameron Crowe's story at least offers an explanation for the confusion. The explanation won't satisfy everyone (as some of the harsh criticism of the film shows), but to focus too much on this is to miss the point, which is to make us ponder some big questions regarding truth and reality. Helped by some very good performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and some stunning visual effects (such as a truly eerie scene of a deserted New York City), Vanilla Sky is an entertaining and intellectually stimulated film. Just don't  expect a straightforward, linear story.",1024790400,4,1144,4.958333333333333
1438138,5,B00005JKMY,"What's most surprising about this film - other than that Cameron Diaz can be quite convincing in a dramatic role - is the way it has been marketed.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that what I had thought, from the trailers, was just going to be another romantic-thriller with an A-list cast, was actually a far more complex and compelling sci-fi story.  From the tone of most reviews, however, it clearly doesn't pay to mislead your public.  What is it with audiences these days?  Don't they like surprises?  You'd think that the deluge of predictable excrement that flows out of Hollywood's studios every year would have most viewers excited to find a film which doesn't pander to their expectations.  Clearly not.  I hope it doesn't discourage Crowe and others like him from pursuing projects like this one.  Hollywood typically butchers every European film it tries to ""repackage"" into a spoon-fed format for American audiences.  `Vanilla Sky' is a notable exception, and well worth seeing.",1024704000,44,1001,5.0181818181818185
1438139,5,B00005JKMY,"The critics and audiences all around were right.  It's not hype; this movie is AMAZING.  I was very anxious to see this movie.  I heard that it was confusing and that it messes with your head, and that's why I wanted to see it.  I like those kinds of movies.  I like a movie to keep my interest and keep me guessing until the very end.  ""Vanilla Sky"" is a powerful, stunning, beautiful, and clever film.
A quick recap of the story; very quick because this is one of those movies you have to be careful how you explain it, or you might give it away.  This is the story of a man who has it all; great looks, a successful buisness, money, and most importantly, the women.  One night at a party he meets what he thinks is his true love.  But after a jealous woman sees the two interact, she decides to confront Cruise, and that's when everything comes crashing down into a horrible nightmare that seems neverending.
The performances were awesome.  Tom Cruise did a really good job.  Possibly one of his best roles.  The script was very well written and thought out.  The movie was brilliantly directed as well.
The best thing I liked about this movie was it kept my interest the entire time.  It keeps you thinking and guessing until the very end, very much like ""Memento.""  I would love to compare this to another movie, but I'm afraid if I do that, it'll give this movie away.  So I will refrain from doing so.  After you see this, see if you can guess the movie.
There are a bunch of special features on this DVD, but I haven't had a chance to check them all out yet.  The picture quality is breathtaking and the sound is incredible.
I know a lot of people left the theatres or their rooms confused.  Many people did not get this movie.  Well, I thought that I wouldn't get it, but the last twenty or fifteen minutes of the movie explains everything and it all comes together.  You will be thinking about this movie well after it is over.
It's not hype; it's fact.  This is an outstanding movie that really surprised me on so many different levels.  This is one I'm sure I will watch over and over again.  If you want a clever movie with a great story and plot, this is your movie.  ""Vanilla Sky"" is a beautiful movie that expands the mind in so many different ways.",1024704000,4,2265,4.297872340425532

1438141,5,B00005JKMY,"I have seen many reviews that describe this film as confusing.  To a point, it is confusing.  It leaves you a little uncertain as to what is occurring or how it could occur.  In one scene David Aames (Tom Cruise's character) says to an apparent stranger that he wishes everyone in the bar would just shut up - and then they do.  You have to wonder, what's going on?  The beauty of the movie is that it gives you an answer and then it all makes sense.  If you watch it a second time (and many people will want to) you can see some clues you missed.  I suppose that many people that dislike this film just do not care for the uncertainty it creates, that is the reason I liked it.  It wasn't in any way ordinary.  There is one question I can answer for people who see the film and wonder why the ""Lucid Dream"" began when it did.  Of course, it began when David Aames choose it to begin but why at that point.  Because, it was the lowest point in his life - he wanted to take his life from that point and make it happy from there.  That does make sense if you think about it - but if you don't like to think about movies when they're over.  You should definately watch something else - I believe the ""Fast and the Furious"" is available for you.  Another point about this movie is that it touches on the effect of pop culture in our lives.  The movies we see, the music we hear, etc.  It all has an effect on us as we go through life - I don't believe any movie has ever brought that point to light in quite the surprising way this one does.  Last point is the music, there is a lot of great music in this film - old and new.  And it's used to great effect - the song ""Can We Still be Friends"" is powerful, and the ""Elevator Beat"" is both sentimental and haunting.",1024617600,3,1760,4.03757225433526

  Cameron Crowe, who also directed last years ""Almost Famous"", which I also loved, directes Vanilla Sky into a climatic shower of the unknown every minute, while the plot unfolds into a mind bubbling unexpected twist of suspense, love, hate, dreams, sex and jealousy.
  Tom Cruise is at his best here, and gives every emotion forward to make us inhale the wonderful sensual feelings that his character feels and goes through. Cruz and Diaz are a delight, and Kurt Russell, who rarely does a film today is wonderful as the part of McCabe the lawyer.
  A lot of critism has been made over Vanilla Sky, mostly because people just don't get it. It's hard to explain how you feel after the viewing Vanilla Sky for the first time. You alsot feel confused, but enjoyed and entertained at the same time, wanting you to go back for more to see it again. Upon your second viewing of Vanilla Sky, your questions will be answered and you will see the real beauty and love story that Vanilla Sky portrays.

1438177,2,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky, the worst movie in my recent memory, can be described in two words: pretentious and tedious.  While at times visually stimulating (especially the Cruise/Diaz sex-scene... hilarious, hence the 2 stars, not 1) this film uses too many one-liners, dramatic and pretentious moments, and try-to-be-artsy gimmicks to trick viewers into believing there is some substance.
Repeated phrases like ""I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats"" are useless, meaningless sentences veiled in a mask of intelligence, when they are anything but intelligent or insightful.  The point of one-liners like this (there are MANY) is to pretend that there is an intellectual purpose of the movie, building the film up to a point where it just seems ridiculous, and you feel like laughing out loud.
Contrary to what some might say, there is nothing new about this movie, nothing groundbreaking, and nothing worthy of noting... besides its feeble attempt towards the end to make it a science-fiction movie, with special effects and all.
Meandering through a bunch of tedious plot twists also got excessively dull, as the makers tried to fool its audience repeatedly, saying ""ha ha!  you were thinking THIS was going to happen!  silly audience..."" much the same way as Mission Impossible: 2 did, with the cheap trickery of masks, an easy way to twist the plot and trick the audience.
Basically, the movie constantly pounds you over the head time after time after time with high-sounding phrases and annoying surprises so much that in the end, you think that the building up was for something interesting or new, but in fact, you were just being set up for nothing but a complete waste of your time.

1. ""Worst movie ever"" appears as the tag of many reviews. Either you don't see enough movies if you think this or you have hit your head recently.
2. ""Poor script."" Oh, well then, maybe you should go to Hollywood and do better, hotshot.
3. ""Didn't know what it wanted to be."" OK, I too was thrown a bit by the direction the movie went in, but I hung on. In fact, I laughed when I realized I'd been on the hook for so long only to realize it was a sci-fi trip.
4. ""Made no sense/convoluted/too many twists."" Fortunately for me, I unkowingly inoculated myself from senselessness by watching ""Mulholland Drive"" last month. Everything after that has been as easy to decipher as a See-Spot-Run book.
I had a good time being taken by this movie. And I understand Cameron Crowe liking pop culture so much as to mix it into his movies.

Tom and Penelope are AMAZING together in this movie, and it you can totally see the chemistry between them. Their love for each other is evident and Vanilla Sky was the perfect movie for them to play together in. The one thing that is very striking about this movie is the music within it. Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Chemical Bros, are a perfect mix but the bad thing is that the soundtrack does not have a lot of the music in it. But watching the movie over again just to experience the music is worth it. And the story plot will make you appreciate love and what it's all about.

It is exteremly difficult watching Tom Cruise's character quickly degenerate from a man who is larger than life to nothing but an empty shell.  Also there are many confusing shifts in Tom's characters perception of reality that don't make a lot of sense at first.  But the ending is brilliant!!!  Once you understand the significance of Benny the dog and take a trip to ""L.E."" it all fits together perfectly.  This is a masterpiece of mind bending film making!!  The ending provides a choice to Cruise's character, wheter to keep living in  a dream or to ""OPEN YOUR EYES"" an face an uncertin future. This is a choice we all have to make.

(and the quickest among you will note the Hepburn film 'sabrina' playing on Cruise's TV in the opening sequence -- the playboy/the lovesick waif -- aha!). yes, the music is awesome. yes the visuals are there. and yes it does fall apart in the last third. oh well. it is compelling to watch, though it feels like some substance has been sacrificed for style, but to some style is enough.

1438217,4,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky shines in a way few other movies ever do. The real significance of a movie like Vanilla Sky is it opens peoples' eyes to the possibiblities of science.  The obvious messages: ""it's the little things that matter"", ""every moment is a chance to change your life"", ""the sweet is not as sweet without the bitter"" have been done countless times in movies past.  What hasn't been done is a realistic portrayal (in the movies) of the possibilties for cryonics and life extension research for mankind.
The fact that the movie broaches this subject in such an ingenious way makes the movie a winner.  Vanilla Sky has its weak points to be sure, the acting scenes in the disco and the all-of-a-sudden strained relationship with his best friend for example.  But in general the movie is very enlightening and opens the minds of those who may be blinded by myths and fairytales to the possibilities of a marvelous and REAL future of science....a life without disease and aging....maybe death as we now know it.
The protagonist has enough vision to try to give himself another chance, avoid the maggots six feet under, and is rewarded for his ingenuity and courage.  That is a real possibility, a real chance he gives himself...it's not paying homage to some unknown entity based on primitive writings thousands of years ago.

1438218,4,B00005JKMY,"Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" is a remake of ""Open Your Eyes"" which was created by Alejandro Amenabar who also did ""The Others"". Crowe did an excellent job of giving us his interpretation and not just a duplicate. He incorporates his own themes of pop culture's influence on everyday life and twists a few other plot elements. I do not want to give any of the secrets away but all I can say is this movie does not turn out into what you expect it would if you judge it from the first 20 minutes or so.
The problem is that the original plot is complicated enough and then with Crowe's extra elements, I thought it cluttered the story and that the dialogue was trying to be too poetic. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie but I think they explained the plot to the audience too much at the end, as if all of us would not understand although a few still did not catch on.

This is a movie about a young man (Tom Cruise) born wealthy who doesn't have a care in the world.  He's basically a playboy and uses women as he deems fit.  Cameron Diaz plays one of the women who falls in love with Cruise and when she see's that Cruise is falling for Penelope Cruz she goes a bit nuts.  I don't want to tell you any more because I don't want to let anything out of the bag but the rest of the movie up untill the very end will leave you very confused and trying unsuccessfully to figure out what's going on.

It kept me into the movie, it kept me glued to the screen trying to predict what is going on.

If your looking for a cheap thrill, or a sappy love movie this movie is not for you. Its a movie (if you get it - which a lot of people don't) that causes you to ask some questions about your own life, which is the underlying message throughout the movie.

I wasn't sure what to expect here, but I really enjoyed this movie.  Despite all the big-name actors, this is not a ""blockbuster"", in fact it has more of the feel of an independent film.  It is the mind-bending tale of a rich magazine editor who is disfigured in a car accident, and from there his life is never the same.  Strange things begin to happen, and he can't tell what's real and what isn't.  The acting is great, the special effects are done well (but don't worry, there aren't that many), and the story has perfect pace.  I've heard many complaints that this movie is ""confusing"", but I don't know why, because I understood it completely.  Unlike a lot of movies with twists and turns, the twists and turns actually have purpose, and in the end everything makes perfect sense, even if it didn't as you were watching it.
I wouldn't call this the most brilliant movie ever, but it's certainly a breath of fresh air, when you consider how bad most of today's movies are.  I'm disappointed at the low review average here.

His version comes across like N'Sync covering a Beatles tune.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and see the original instead.  Of course you will have to read subtitles (god forbid).

 At first i assumed this was because i had seen the original(ABRE LOS OJOS) and knew the outcome, but then i watched abre los ojos again and there it was ....the full impact all over again.
i chalk it up to passion, the original writer/director ALEJANDRO AMENABAR ( who also made ""THE OTHERS"" with nicole kidman) was passionate about his work and knew exactly what he wanted to convey. This movie was glossed over by the hollywood ""HEAVY HITTERS""( CROWE/CRUISE WHO WERE ALSO FANS OF THE ORIGINAL) who remade it, yet don't come across as fully understanding the original as it was first envisioned. I give them an A for effort but believe that alejandro's original is still the PAR for this effort.

As usual, Tom plays Tom again and for good measure, he throws his latest girlfriend into the picture and guess what folks?  She can't ACT!!
Now I do have one positive note on this film--I actually liked Cameron Diaz in her role.  She gave a brilliant performance and I think this girl is being typecast as the funny girl.  Hasn't every woman who has been screwed over by a man wanted to get revenge?  Cameron proved to me she can be a serious actress when she wants to be.
Other than that, it took me an hour to wretch and purge this film out of my system.  As time went by, Tom's head got bigger and bigger and bigger and I think I threw up the contents of that head.

1438271,2,B00005JKMY,"I think the main problem with ""Vanilla Sky"" is that it is such a departure from director Cameron Crowe's previous films.  While past projects like Say Anything, Singles, and Almost Famous were quirky films about relationships,  this movie is mind-boggling and, at times, boring.
Tom Cruise plays wealthy executive David, whose life is changed when he decides to romance lovely Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and ignore his possessive girlfriend Julie (Cameron Diaz).  Julie crashes her car with David in it, killing herself and disfiguring his face. While David struggles against his unsightly appearance and the possibility of murder charges, the plot slowly builds into a confusing blur between reality and fantasy, incorporating a strange kind of death technology.
Throughout most of the movie, I was not entirely sure what was going on.  I didn't know who was alive or who was dead.  I DID know that I was not really interested in the story.  Some reviewers made an excellent point recently about the John Travolta film Basic:  they said it had SO many twists and turns that it lost its steam.  I believe the same thing could be said about Vanilla Sky.  It's really a shame too, because I think there was a powerful message about beauty and happiness that gets lost amidst the weirdness.
These kind of suspense dramas don't seem to match with Cameron Crowe.  I expect this kind of film from someone like David Fincher or Christopher Nolan, but I prefer Crowe when he's writing and directing deep, humanist pictures about love and coming-of-age.  I guess I have to applaud him for taking a chance on something different, but the film itself could have been much better.
The performances aren't bad, which saves the movie from being a total loss.  Penelope Cruz really stands out; she's the perfect charming woman to sweep Cruise's David off his feet.  (Coincidence??)  Mr. Cruise is average, flashing his winning smile just enough for us to believe he can emcompass what it's like to be a rich, good-looking publishing exec.  Let's just say playing a handsome man that women love to stalk is not a big departure from Cruise's actual persona.  Diaz lends enough craziness to be a prettier version of Glenn Close's famous Fatal Attraction psycho.  I don't feel that this is as big a breakout role for her as many critics thought.  (For that role, see Being John Malkovich.)  Finally, Jason Lee plays Brian, the underappreciated and underrated best friend of David.  He isn't allowed much opportunity to develop his character, which annoys me a bit.  I guess it's still taking Hollywood time to accept him in dramatic roles.
Conclusion:  perhaps the original ""Abre Los Ojos"" should have been left alone.  Nine times out of ten, remakes just don't stack up to the originals.  This film just didn't work for me.",1023580800,,2800,4.908510638297872

Nothing is as it seems, up is down, down is up, good is bad and bad is good, and the only reality/clarity to be gleaned from this mish-mosh of juvenile sci-fi bad bad movies is that this particular movie stinks. Tom Cruise in a latex mask, sheets that contain the hidden forms of either Penelope Cruz or Cameron Diaz, (lady or the tiger) and a board of cartoon characters from the Addams Family, added to the psyhcobabble plot-line, whatever that was supposed to be, and you have a movie that makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Citizen Kane. The trailer/preview is a lie, and all the  interesting and pertinent interaction between Cruise and Diaz takes place within the first minutes of the movie, and the subsequent ""action"" is all Cruise in his mask suffering angst from what may or may not have happened and trying to discern what was a dream, lucid or not, and what was reality.

The main character played by Tom Cruise is a selfish magazine owner born with a silver spoon in his mouth. That's OK, even though he's not a very likeable character, he does have enough redeeming qualities to make you care what happens to him. Penelope Cruz is a sweet, enthusiastic character who doesn't fall for his tricks, but falls in love with him and he falls for her. A stellar performance by Cameron Diaz as a woman used by the main character for sex, takes the ultimate revenge and scars him for life. What ensues after that is a twisted maze of continuously changing storylines, leaving the viewer completely confused at what's going on. Worst of all, you don't even care. I agree with the other reviewer who said this movie is disjointed. It's so disjointed that half-way through the movie I almost shut it off. Still, I stuck it out.

Afterwards I started exploring the special features and learned a few insights from the short films included on the DVD. It was enough to get me to start to watch the movie again with the director's (Cameron Crowe)commentary. Then I thought that's a little crazy since it made me throw up after the first time. However, listening to the commentary one learns that the movie is full of ""clues"" and while you might pick these out of the movie it is still difficult to determine their significance. While the movie might appear to be cleverly choreographed it is actually open to the viewers individual interpretation.

1438315,1,B00005JKMY,"Skip Vanilla Sky and rent Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos). I don't know what Cameron Crowe was thinking when he decided to remake a recent, intelligent movie. Tom Cruise basically plays himself: a self-centered rich guy who sleeps with women and runs away when he's done with them, which gets him into trouble when Cameron Diaz ends up driving her car off a bridge with him in it. She's dead, he's disfigured. Penelope Cruz plays the woman who transforms Cruise into a ""good man"". Then all hell breaks loose, and the plot becomes insane and the film begins to try to hard to be cool and impress the viewer with bizarreness.
It's almost obvious that Crowe used this movie as an excuse to put his favorite songs to film. He also uses so many pop-culture references in the finale that it's ridiculous. And the sci-fi ending, which actually makes sense in the original, is over the top and completely stupid in this movie.",1023062400,5,917,4.597560975609756

It has you guessing what's going on until the last 10 minutes when it finally reveals itself....and if you understand it, it is very powerful.  It is woven together with delicate skill, with subtle hints that will make more sense when you watch it a second time.  And this is a movie that deserves a second viewing...for some it would be needed in order to understand it fully.
There are some deep universal truths that are buried in here that can carried into your own life.  Like 'The Matrix', the physical external world is an extension of the self, for instance the line 'there is no spoon.  you're not bending the spoon, you are bending yourself'....similar to the line in the cafe when ""the man"" tells tom cruise 'what if i told you that you can control every person in here.  that, you are their god?'.

1438367,2,B00005JKMY,"From previews, reviews, and word of mouth, I knew there was some sort of catch to Vanilla Sky where all wasn't what it seemed and there was a fine line between dreams and reality.  Miraculously, I hadn't learned the ending of this movie so I was prepared to enjoy a well-made movie (it has to be well made with Cameron Crowe directing) with a surprise ending.  I was disappointed on all counts.
The movie losely tells the story of Cruise's character falling in love with Cruz' character while Cameron Diaz begins to stalk him.  She disfigures him while wrecking her car and killing herself.  Cruise rebuilds his life enough to enter into a relationship with Cruz.  But nightmares and visions keep coming back in the form of Cameron Diaz.
The story appears to be being told in flashback fashion because we know that Cruise is in jail for murder and being interviewed by a pshychiatrist.  So while watching the movie, I want to know about the murder and also about all of the weird dreams Tom Cruise is having?
Close to the end, I gave up on following what was happening because it became to convoluted and confusing.  It quit being a movie and became just a bunch of scenes thrown together.
Then came the ending.  Finally everything is explained.  All of the earlier scenes make sense.  But also the earlier scenes and the entire movie become a meaningless waste of time.  I don't want to give away why, but let me just say that the movie should have ended after Cruise passes out drunk in the street.
So much of the drama, emotion, and relationships in the movie was rendered useless by the ending.  This was one movie where the ""surprise"" twist at the ending is nothing but a big disappointment.",1023062400,,1696,4.579470198675497

1438369,5,B00005JKMY,"This is a spoiler, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie yet.
This is it in a nut shell:
Here is what happens...
Guy treats girl badly... meets another girl he likes better...  girl gets upset and kills herself with him in the car.
He gets out of the hospital with his face all messed up....tries to get back with girl he really likes... she ignores him at the bar.
He wakes up in the street, and goes on about his life...
He keeps seeing the ad for LE (they kept asking him who ELLIE was). LE was the company that froze the dog and brought it back to life.
He signs a contract with LE that when he dies, he wants to be frozen, but he gets the `dreams' package, where you continue to dream while you are frozen. (Why a guy who has nightmares would do this, I have no idea).
A few months go by and he still wants the girl, and feeling sorry for himself, OD's on pills and alcohol and dies.
In his contract with LE, he had the option of starting his dream any where in his life. If, for example, he was 100 years old when he died, he could be 20 in his dream state.
He chose to go back to the moment he passed out on the street that night. For his dream to begin there... (his face was never fixed...that was his dream)
His conscious messed with him... even though he wanted to live his dream state with his face fixed and with the girl he loved, the other girl he used still was in his conscious and it was interfering with his dream.
So, he is figuring this out on his own as he is being `questioned' by `someone else', who is really his ideal father figure.
So, they explain to him all this stuff, he remembers it, and then they say 150 years has gone by. They fixed the bug in the software that allowed this nightmare to continue as long as it did and they could continue his dream-state, or, if he would rather, they could wake him up. The technology of the future 150 years from now can fix his face and bring him back to life.
For him to choose to come back to life, he must conquer his fear of heights by jumping off the roof (once again, these were all requirements he originally ordered on his contract before he died). But dreams are so real... He really feels as though he is really jumping off the top of a building. Or, he can not jump, stay frozen, and continue in dream-land without the nightmares.
So before he jumps, he conjures up his love again, and remembers what she said at the bar about talking to him in their next life when they are `both cats'.
He thinks that is ironic since she is long dead and he is continuing his life 150 years later. So he is going to look for her in his new life. To find her re-incarnated in someone alive 150 years later. He prefers that over dreaming.
Then he jumps off the building, and his whole life flashes before his eyes....and then he wakes up...(yes, 150 years later) and then the credits roll.",1023062400,2,2865,4.143626570915619

Beautiful cinematography... it has such a crisp, clear look to it... most of the images are truly vibrant, and almost have a life of their own. Now, I didn't hold much hope for this movie, I will admit... but I must confess, that I enjoyed 90% of ""Vanilla Sky"". I even found Penelope Cruz to be tolerable... and we all know how difficult THAT feat is! I will say that there was something interesting, enjoyable and almost voyeuristic about watching a week in the life of Tom Cruise's character.
Now for the ending... it seemed rushed... like everyone involved was sitting around saying.. ""Urmm.. ok.. we wrote ourselves into a corner here, now, how do we go about capping off this flick?"". A big dartboard was put up, and some office assistant threw at it... landing on the final ending. Which, turns out to be a tremendous cop out.

I guess the plots of every film but this one caught me completely off guard. When he jumps off the top of the building I worried that the director would ruin the film with some kind of ""Hollywood"" ending but he added just the perfect visual - one eye opening.

I love action blockbusters, but there needs to be other films where a director takes some bigger chances than just losing the studio money.  This film takes the artistic chances, but fails.  The first 30 minutes set up an interesting realm of possibilities, but then the rest of the movie is just bad.  The last 10 minutes of the guy from ""shine"" explaining the plot closes the lid and flushes the toilet.  Tom Cruise is very good in this.  The story comes together so artificially in the end.  Ultimately, it looks like an American director failing in an attempt to make a foreign movie with a fine American cast.  Nice try, but it didn't work.  Three stars for effort.

""Vanilla Sky"" is so ""bizarre"". It sticks in too many elements at the same time. It leaves you wondering, and confused. Everything is so...bizarro. Though I have to admit, Mr. Crowe is very darn creative, and has a vivid imagination. It's a movie that's hard to understand while you watch it, but don't understand anything until the end. At the end it'll make you say, ""Oh...I get it now! Okay...uh, whatever"". ""The Sixith Sense"" is a prefect example of a very good ""bizzare"" movie.

It's an amazing story ( matryx anyone??? ), food for thought...it sticks in your mind for days!!
It has touches of romance, suspense and it's even a bit scary.
I can't compare it to the original feature, Abre Los Ojos, because Vanilla Sky has a different aproach to the plot, let's say that things are warmer here and each film is a winner.
The photography of the film is superb and the DVD has an amazing picture quality to it.

After swearing that I would never buy the dvd, I saw that there was commentary on it and I broke my word and ran down to the store to get my copy of Vanilla Sky. After watching this film several times now, I find it to be an ok film. On the good side, it looks beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful. I liked the idea of a man experiencing an evening of bliss, destroying his life because he is unwilling to leave that one moment behind him and move on. Certainly, one must respect Cameron Crow for trying to make a movie different from his previous ones. Individual parts of this movie are wonderful. The relationships and dynamics between the different characters are interesting and should be explored further. It is obvious that a considerable amount of heart was put behind the making of this film. However, when all is said and done, this film leaves you unsatisfied and wanting more. Crow falls into the Hollywood trap of repeating himself and his ideas over and over, so that the audience will be sure to get it. He could be doing this for a reason, and I have thought of several reasons why this might be important to the meaning of the story. Unless your willing to watch this film several times and spend the time to pick through and analyze the film, this repitition just comes across as the arrogant director feeling the audience is too stupid to get his ideas and vision. It is never a good sign when you have to ask yourself, ""Am I beginning to like this film because I am starting to understand it, or if with all the  documentaries and commentary on the disc, Cameron Crow has just talked me into thinking this film is meaningful and important?"". It is a movie worth watching at least twice, and it's an important step for Cameron Crow as a writer/director, but it has several flaws and the ending ties up too smoothly (a trait of every Crow film, which he has proved doesn't always have to be bad).",1022889600,,2089,4.454308093994778

1438407,5,B00005JKMY,"I have not seen ""Abre Los Ojos,"" so I viewed Vanilla Sky without any comparative reference point.
What I CAN tell you is that it was one of the most jarring movies I've seen in years--and I mean that in a good way.  There's nothing better than a movie which you'll think about long after you've seen it, and I'll never forget this one.
The Cameron Diaz scene in the car is something you will never forget.
According to Crowe, there's 4 different interpretations floating around for this movie.  The one he forwards (and directs) is the most easily digestible, but he's open to anything.
BONUS about the DVD: in his audio commentary, Crowe will provide you clues and basically explain what is really going on, if you didn't catch on first viewing.  This may or may not be to your liking--if you don't like being tipped off I suggest you buy Mulholland Drive, which I'm still trying to figure out (but love regardless).
Apparently a lot of people didn't like this movie because they see the name Cruise and expect action.  This is NOT an action flick--it is a psychological drama along the dreamy lines of movies like Jacob's Ladder, Mulholland Drive and even the Matrix in some respects.  Lots of clues, lots of unforgettable scenes, and here's my one clue that doesn't give too much away: LISTEN TO THE MUSIC.  The songs are all cues in themselves.
Hell even the Paul McCartney song at the end of the movie is good!  When was the last time you could say that?

 Perhaps I am in the minority, but I view this film  as irritatingly disjointed, and purposely confusing.  You think you know what's going on, then, everything abruptly changes to show the viewer that they've been fooled time and time again.  After a while, there's no fathomable plot-line, and nothing worth attempting to decipher anyway.

 Are we supposed to find Tom Cruise's character, a sympathetic one?  A guy who's had everything handed to him, and is callously carefree and confident?  Cameron Diaz is the most entertaining character, and leaves too soon as she gives him his due, but then what on earth is happening after that?  Is what's happening even ON earth? From that point on, this is an incomprehensible mess of a story, and a mystery not quite tempting enough to solve.  Even when you think you've got it seemingly figured out, there's some break or sudden change to let you know you've been fooled again.  That can be fun, and necessary in a ""who-dunnit"" mystery scenario, but in ""Vanilla Sky"", it only seems obnoxious.

 Director Cameron Crowe has mastered many fine films in a long successful career, but I'm afraid this time, despite a decent cast, the relentless and  repeated juxtapositionof the plot line, makes ""Vanilla Sky"" a tedious, pretentious, and highly confusing viewing experience.",1022544000,5,1447,4.917355371900826

Cameron here's a tip: Next time when recording a commentary go to your office!.
Also in the DVD there was mentioned a conversation with tom cruise.. What it is is this: Cameron calls tom during the commentary... and we hear ""Hi tom"" ... ""We're thinking about you"". ... ""aha"" ... ""aha"" ... etc.

I was also supposed to be fascinated by the plot twists and turns while I was simultaneously guessing my [rearend] off about what was REALLY happening. Maybe, if I hadn't been trying so hard to stay awake during this movie, I might have become engaged in staying with those twists and turns and guessing. Instead, I flat out didn't care because no one in this movie gave me any reason to even be slightly interested. By the time the guy showed up near the end to sort of explain this hodge podge of mush, I felt too tired by it all to care much why anyone did anything.
Once again, the trailer for this movie promised far more than the film itself could deliver. The trailer hinted at a mystery and suspense. It did not suggest that the mystery would be why I bought a ticket to see this stuff, and the only suspense would be when the ending would finally show up. Because of the nature of this movie, it's difficult to say much about the actual plot without giving away too much for those who may enjoy it and don't want any of it spoiled for them. I have seen discussions on message boards among people who want to debate the points of what was real and what wasn't real in the storyline, so I do realize that others did get something from this movie I just didn't see or care about. For me, this was just another film with a gimmick that was done to showcase Tom Cruise and his perfect hair. That's not enough for me to recommend it to someone else or to try to find some redeeming quality in it to justify the time and money I wasted in the movie theater.

Ms. Cruz doesn't do all so great. With this film Mr. Crowe is attempting to do something more in the relm of the late Stanly Kubrick. The movie finally breaks out of the his signature mold. At the end, everything builds up and you know something very strange has to happen to explain everything. The way this all plays out is a little dissapointing and I felt somewhat cheated... There just aren't enough clues in the movie to support the ending. Having said that, the plot isn't bad. It doesn't have any slow parts and you're always trying to figure out what's going to happen next.
The DVD bonus material isn't worth much. The most notable thing is the promo world tour (you get to see the relationship between Tom and his new love develop, how sweet.. (yawn). You also get to listen to Cameron Crowe rave on about how great Vanilla Sky is (again.. yawn).
 This movie really is quite bad compared to the film it's trying to remake.",1022371200,,1407,4.309433962264151

1438448,1,B00005JKMY,"After the horrible films entitled Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, I decided to give Tom Cruise another chance, after all his preformance in Top Gun was first rate. None the less although as an actor Tom is pretty good, he choses the worst movies to play in! Take this one for example, Vanilla Sky is by far the worst movie I've seen in a long time! I watched it for free and still asked for my money back, I haven't seen the original forign film to actually compare, only by word of mouth, but from what I've been hearing this movie does the original no justice!
Of all the people who've rented this movie since it came out, and there's been a lot, I have found only one person to have anything at all nice to say about it. Of corse if you are the type to like movies that you sit through for two or more hours and come out having no clue what you just watched, then you'll probably love this flick!
That, however is all this movie is, one big mass of chaos and confusion that makes no sence what so ever, even after they attempt to explain it all in the end. Anyone who wants to watch this film, I suggest you be sure that you are being paid to watch it, and not you paying to watch it, otherwise you are just wasting your hard earned money on a pile of junk!",1022371200,,1257,4.093117408906883
1438489,4,B00005JKMY,"""Vanilla Sky"" is based on a Spanish thriller written and directed by Alejendro Amenabar. Tom Cruise bought the rights to remake the movie and brought on board his friend, esteemed director Cameron Crowe, who did ""Jerry McGuire"" with him.
David [Cruise] seems to have it all. He's smart, good-looking and rich. He runs a publishing empire left to him by his father. His girlfriend, Julie [Cameron Diaz], is gorgeous and devoted. But his life is not nearly as secure as he thinks it is. His board of directors sees him as a spendthrift playboy and wants him out. His best friend, Brian [Jason Lee] is secretly filled with jealousy. When he falls for a Spanish dancer, Sofia [Cruz], Julie informs him that their relationship is not the casual fling he thinks it is. Full of rage and fury, she commits an act that destroys his privileged life.
Or does she? Is anything in the movie what it appears to be? Could Julie and Sophia be the same woman? Does what Sophia do to David really scar him for life, or does he imagine it? There is a murder, or is there? Is the story taking place in the past, the present or the distant future? By the end of the movie, will the average viewer even care?
Personally, I liked ""Vanilla Sky"" a great deal. I think it is one of the most underrated movies of 2001. Having already seen the Spanish version, I knew what to expect. The vast majority of the remake's audience didn't have this advantage. It is anything but commercial, although it has the big-name talent and large budget generally associated with mainstream entertainment.
Ironically, the biggest problem with the movie may be Tom Cruise. He's a great star but not a great actor, in my opinion, because, whatever he is in, he is always Tom Cruise, the star - bigger than life, sure of himself, and always overplaying his part. That works well in vehicles properly tailored for him, like ""Mission Impossible"" or ""Jerry McGuire"". The role of David requires someone more subtle and softer - Brad Pitt or Edward Norton perhaps.
Cameron Crowe again demonstrates his fine directorial talents. ""Vanilla Sky"" may not rank as one of his best works, but considering the complexity of the story, I think he did well.
For people who like a little intellectual challenge in their movies or who love a puzzle, this is a good choice. Everyone else should probably pass.",1022284800,,2344,4.664251207729468

I went to this movie expecting the same but was pleasantly surprised. This was one of those movies I walked out of the theater going ""Man, I can't wait till this comes out on DVD"". Well here it is May 21st, 2002 and I now own one of the most overlooked movies of 2001. Gone is the sap that oozes in most Cameron Crowe movies, and in its place a great story that keeps you interested to the very end. Crowes main ingredient in this is the always good Tom Cruise. Add to that the very Jeckyl and Hyde performances of Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, and you've got a very intense, intelligent, and erotic movie. The Times Square scene is worth the price alone. I don't want to go too in depth into the movie because I don't want to give anything away, but it is definetly great movie making. The DVD package is just as good as I was hoping for. Included is a great commentary with Crowe, Nancy Wilson, and a special phone appearance by Mr. Cruise. Not one, but two featurettes, an interview with Paul McCartney, music video, photo gallery, and a couple of unreleased trailers. I am very happy with this movie and DVD presentation.

When will the academy realize that not only is this actor a hugh box office draw, but he has the abilty to act circles around any of his peers.  When an actor can allow his wonderful good looks to be stripped away and wear the face of a monster should have the respect that his acting ability deserves.  I was  blown away by the ending and the expressions that Mr. Cruise has as reality begins to seap in is the stuff that real movie making is made of.  From the moment that he was robbed in ""Rain Man"" I have waited for this actor to be recognized for his talent.  Guess he's just going to have to keep tugging away at it.

The DVD is a DVD, not a VHS on a DVD disc. The navigation, transitions and background sounds were well thought out and make the disc an overall ""dream"" to explore.

Hats off to the photo gallery (almost worth the price of the disc alone to see pictures of Penelope Cruz).
I must have spent an hour or so just checking out the special features on the disc prior to watching the movie. I think it's the background music and sounds that pulls me back to the root menu. Overall an excellent DVD with superb quality and features.

My personial opinion of this film  is support Total Recall it deserves it far better than this rip off.  And for his new film The Others starring Nicole Kidman, watch the Sixth Sense, it's the same damn film, it even has the same cover art.  He should stick to writing music he's good at that, as far as writing goes hire someone thats creative. At least redo a film that didn't copy off of something else to begin with.  Beside from this point that I can't seem to let go of his films as well as the remake of open your eyes are extremely well crafted, they don't beat out Kubrick from a long shot, but they're very well done in their direction and editing.  They're worth seeing just for Penelope Cruz, gosh darn are you one hot woman.

Good acting all around, although I can't stand penelope cruz and her ""i can't speak english"" accent coupled by her ""look how cute I am"" bug eyed stare into the camera. Cameron Diaz once again shows that she's more then a booty shaker, but at times she goes over the deep end with the character. This film is a pretty good mystery, although the soundtrack should have been skipped in favor of an orchestral score but oh well. The only bad thing was how at the end everything is literally told to us step by step so that even the casual movie goer will not leave the theatre perplexed. Some ambiguity would have been nice, something to discuss with others after seeing the film. The end scene was a bit dragged and could have been shorter. One last complaint, our main character is supposed to be learning a lesson through out this film. But by the end he really doesn't learn anything. If you see the movie you'll understand what I mean. The choice he makes at the end isn't soo hard as he is explained how life must continue for him. If he was faced with a more bleak future yet face it courageously we might feel more for this uptight sometimes charming always prideful rich white guy. Can't feel sorry for him, even when his face is deformed he still is good looking. Oh well. It's worth seeing once, not bad at all. Good directing work and a pretty good story.

1438556,2,B00005JKMY,"Before fans of this film savage me, can I just start off by saying that I so much wanted to love this movie. I am a Cameron Crowe fan, I like Cameron Diaz, loved Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire and looked forward to seeing Penelope Cruz in a decent role. The preview trailers were excellent, although misleading, and made me optimistically look forward to an excellent romantic thriller with a stellar leading cast; Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and the very sultry Penelope Cruz and on that basis this movie looked like a sure fire winner. Ultimately though this movie has a character crisis, unable to decide whether it's one thing or another (thriller or morality tale, science fiction or romance) it falls into the gulf between.

I don't like to spoil the movies for those who haven't seen them before by revealing too many plot details but for what its worth the outline story, told in flashback, is as follows; Tom Cruise is David Aames a rich, handsome New Yorker, who has inherited a magazine empire from his father and has everything he wants: A great life, a great car, a beautiful occasional girlfriend (Cameron Diaz) and a great art collection, including a Monet, from whence the films Vanilla Sky title comes. However at his glamorous birthday party, he falls for his best friend's girl, Sofia (the beautiful Penelope Cruz, reprising her role from Open Your Eyes). Unfortunately though, this excites the jealousy of David's latest conquest, Julie (Cameron Diaz), a would-be singer and bunny boiler, leading to the `not very stable' Julie driving off a bridge, with him in the passenger seat, permanently (?) disfiguring him. Doctors provide him with a prosthetic mask and then set about restoring his appearance and David learns the true meaning of love and the superficiality of good looks but something is rotten in the state of Denmark (okay maybe not Denmark but you get the point), as David's life starts to unravel with terrifying hallucinations, opening up a Chinese box of puzzles: He is arrested for murdering Julie/Sofia/Julie/Sofia (he's not quite sure which one) and his only ally is Kurt Russell as a very unlikely psychiatrist assigned to his case and given to making profound observations like: 'The subconscious is a powerful thing.' Wow, that's like...really...ahem...deep...don't you think?
As previously mentioned, I am a fan of both actor and Director, particularly Crowe for Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire but I have also enjoyed the ex Mr Kidman in the likes of Rain Man too. The idea of the star and Director of Jerry Maguire re-uniting seemed irresistible but frankly it just doesn't work. One of the big deals of this movie is supposed to be that Tom Cruise gets his face mashed in a car accident leaving him hideously disfigured, sobbing in front of the mirror at the horror of his own appearance but the irony is that although disfigured it isn't very hideous. In fact for much of the movie every opportunity it seems is given to Mr Cruise to peel off his shirt and ripple his six pack (okay, I admit to being jealous on that point).  I can't claim the cultural and intellectual high ground in having not seen the original but by all apparent counts though Vanilla Sky is a glossier but inferior version of the 1997 Spanish movie Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) directed by Alejandro Amenbar, who subsequently went onto stylishly direct the Nicole Kidman movie, The Others. An oddity however is that although Amenbar and his co-writer, Mateo Gil, are credited, the credits also proudly proclaim that it is ""written for the screen and directed by Cameron Crowe"" as if the story had come from some obscure European source material (like a book or a cave painting).
Another of the oddities of this movie is that you can't fault the cast, they all give decent performances, although Kurt Russell was undoubtedly miscast. Ultimately though, the movie falls down because it doesn't know what it is, plus you've seen it before and you've seen it done better. The plot twist doesn't work and is a disappointment and if you want to see a movie that twists and turns between nightmare, hallucination and reality go rent (or even better buy) Jacob's Ladder it would be money better spent. I'm also led to believe that as movie fables go John Frankenheimer's 1966 film, Seconds, in which a clandestine organisation provides youthful bodies for the ageing rich and arranges for them to fulfil their dreams with new lifestyles, is a much more rewarding watch. Vanilla Sky on the other hand is a major disappointment, not awful just disappointing...",1021161600,18,4565,4.858793324775353
1438597,5,B00005JKMY,"Vanilla Sky is Cameron's Crowe most adventurous film to date. After his two previous outings Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous, Vanilla Sky charts new territory as it marks a very different quality and style from the usual embracing of the human spirit that his previous films have explored.
Vanilla Sky at its most basic level is a modern love story that seeks to explain the choices and repercussions that an individual makes. Tom Cruise's character David Aames is a person that has it all, good looks, wealth, success and the women. However the appearance of Sophia (Penelope Cruz) at a party catches his eye and he immediately falls for her. After a self-revelation occurs in that meeting, he sets out to change his life but before he can even get into it, he is involved in a major car accident after spurned lover Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) drives them off a bridge.
That is where the story begins, and David is taken through a totally incomprehensible mind-blowing experience where he finally finds out the truth about his life and himself after numerous twists and turns. This film questions many of the things that human beings stand for, our sense of reality, our perceptions of love, hate, relationships, friendships. It points out excesses and how all of this can turn into an total mind-warping nightmare or a blissful contented existence. We are asked to look reality in the eye and examine our own selves as we journey with the movie. It is best to approach Vanilla Sky with a very open mind, do not watch the movie with Cameron Crowe's other films in mind, it is very different from them and you will be totally frustrated if you do so. Many people panned the movie because they did not understand its complexities and character complexities.
Vanilla Sky defintely warrants more than just one screening, it is filled with numerous clues and cleverly framed scenes. One should watch the movie very carefully and pick out the little tidbits and giveaways. The features on this DVD are very comprehensive. There is an excellent commentary from Crowe and his wife Nancy Wilson where they talk about the movie and its subtle nuances. He enlightens the viewer on some of the perplexing issues that confused audiences during its theatrical run. With DVD, one can leisurely pause and review the movie bit by bit. Perhaps Crowe sums it up best in his comments that Vanilla Sky is ""a movie that extends an invitation...and whereever you want to meet it, it will meet you there."" One has to peel away the layers and put our fixed perceptions and mindsets aside to fully embrace what it has to offer. Tom Cruise also pops up midway during the commentary to talk a little about the movie, so fans will not be disappointed.
For those seeking a context that places the movie in perspective before viewing it, the feature ""prelude to a dream"" serves as a suitable introduction to the movie. Crowe introduces the movie and explains some of his ideas, telling you how to approach the movie and what he essentially set out to do. Other features on the DVD include ""hitting it hard"", a look at how the movie was promoted in various countries by the cast, 2 theatrical trailers and a short interview with Paul McCartney on his composition of the title track 'Vanilla Sky'.
In all, Vanilla Sky ""celebrates the things that made us"" and it is an excellent choice and easy recommendation on DVD.",1020988800,6,3385,4.748726655348047
1438598,2,B00005JKMY,"I went to the movies to see this movie after I saw Open Your Eyes, I was specting to see something just as good, but I was very disapointed, the whole story gets distorted, losing a LOT of the Amenbar touch portrayed in Open Your Eyes, Tesis and The Others.
David Ames is not the playboy Cesar is in the original, David is a nice guy, Cesar is just a guy, too much depth is given to the Julie character, where the character in Open your Eyes is just a girl Cesar's current affair, which happens to be a junkie, unlike Julie who is a singer, has a carrer and no motives to be unstable (4 times in one night sounds SO stupid a reason to kill oneself).
Sofia is really an actress who dresses as a mime in parks, not a dancer, which removes the dream and the rainy scenes from Open your eyes, key scenes.
David's friend makes a video of david and sofia together whereas Pelayo, Cesar's friend takes a PICTURE which he later shows to Cesar when he thinks sofia is not sofia, what did the other guy had to show?
I noticed so many things removed or distorted is not even funny.

1438599,5,B00005JKMY,"When I went to see Vanilla Sky in theatres, I was amazed by two things.  One was how much I loved the movie, and the other was the single most negative audience response I have ever witnessed.  I was literally the only person in the theater who wasn't annoyed at the end of the movie.
Oh well.  Anyway, Vanilla Sky (like Magnolia, also starring Cruise) is one of those films where your appreciation will be directly proportional to how much you like the sheer joy of watching films.  There is no grand point, and not really any moral.  Just a twisting, turning narrative that you absolutely will not see coming.  I mean it.  Unless someone blew the ending for you already, there's no way anyone could predict that this movie would start out as a standard erotic thriller, then take a sharp 90 degree turn to something completely different, then implode in upon itself and become... well, see for yourself.
  It's  fantastically directed, and the acting talent is spotless, but the real joy of Vanilla Sky is watching the story twist and turn and shift genres seemingly at random, pulling the rug out from under you every thirty seconds.  Complaints?  I only have two.  First, the ending might explain a little too much, but then again, it makes sense to reveal all of that information considering who is revealing it, and who is asking.  Secondly, the choice Cruise makes at the very end of the movie...  in actuality, I would have found it much more believable and interesting had he made the opposite choice.  Then again, it doesn't really matter.  The ending is basically a signpost saying ""That's it, we're done with your head. You can go home now.""
  Overall, This is a film you will either love or hate.  The only way to know is to see it.  And I say you should.  I mean, what do you have to lose?  You might end up like me and be pleasantly surprised.",1019952000,3,1858,4.530120481927711

1438604,2,B00005JKMY,"This disappointing film is an English language remake of a Spanish language film of the same name that apparently got great reviews -I can't comment on that  version since I didn't see it. I *can* comment on the Hollywood remake and I can tell  you that it's pretty lame. For a start, the initially intriguing premise transforms the concept of suspense into one of confusion and has enough holes in it to be one of Charo's dresses. My wife and I came up with a dozen inconsistencies within five minutes of leaving the movie- then we never spoke of it again- like cinematic Chinese food, nothing stays with you past the closing credits.
Once again Tom Cruise plays what seems to have become a set character role for him these days- he's like, well....Tom Cruise- the same character from ""Mission Impossible"", ""The Firm"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"" etc. It seems like he's losing range as an actor as time goes on. The rest of the film isn't much better- it's a typical manufactured Hollywood product- the car chase thing, the  twist ending which since ""the Sixth Sense"" now seems mandatory, the ""Fatal Attraction"" love interest thing, the state of the art special effects, the pulse pounding music- it's all so ""been there, done that"". Was it all a dream?- I didn't care by the end of the movie and I don't think you will either.
Not recommended.",1018742400,,1335,4.648305084745763
1438605,5,B00005JKMY,"I loved Vanilla Sky for all of its creativity and guts! Cameron Crowe deserves so much credit for putting out an amazing and truly different movie in times that often only accepts copy cat moviemaking. So it was no surprise this movie opened to not all glowing reviews and as many haters as lovers of the film. This was the most underrated movie of the year and deserved some award attention. Tom Cruise gives his best performance EVER! He was remarkable and I'm not even one of his biggest fans, but he proved himself as an actor with this truly challenging role. The other Cruz was so perfect and charming and a joy to watch. And then there is Diaz, all I can say is WOW! I love her, she is so mind-blowing and in this role proves she's not just the sweetheart funny comedy girl, she's so much more. She gives a completely frightening performance as the obsessive lover of Cruise's David. This film is about making you think and looking at your own life. The things you can't change, the moments you wish you had back. What is reality? What is dreamworld? This is one powerful film. Another one to add to the collect. Thanks to Cameron Crowe who keeps making my favorite movies!!! Almost Famous rocked!!! As does this! SEE this movie! Open your eyes man!",1018742400,7,1256,4.489082969432315
1438606,2,B00005JKMY,"Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a man of -- of just what? Who knows? Is he a rich man of privilege, a prisoner awaiting trial for murder, a traumatized victim of a disfiguring accident struggling for continuity in relationships with friends and lovers, or what? He seems to be all of those from time to time in a mishmash of disjointed episodes that confuse and try the patience of the viewer. The accident that maybe killed or maybe disfigured David (or who knows what) was caused by a vengeful spurned lover played by Cameron Diaz. What is it with her? She can be so sweet and delightful when heroic as in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, and CHARLIE'S ANGELS. So is it by choice that she ends up stuck in unheroic, undelightful, and hard-to-watch roles so often, as in VERY BAD THINGS, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, and now this? Anyhow, as the plot finally develops, we learn that David apparently did die in the accident, but by a contract he had signed with a futuristic life-extension firm, he'd been promised revival into a perfect dream-life. Of course we could predict that his utopian dreams would turn anti-utopian instead. By then we see that all those separate disjointed episodes of at least three different versions of his life (I lost count) are part of the playing out of mixed, reality, promised good dreams, and misfired dreams turned nightmares. By then, one would have to really have patience with this film to want to go back and think out the details of how it all fits together (if it does). I'm still thinking that some of the dreams (nightmarish or otherwise) of the dead (and revived?!?) David seemed clearly to occur before the accident that killed him, So what am I to make of that? I don't know yet, whether I'll get up the interest to go back and view it again and try to resolve that and other confusions. If I do, I'll surely wait for video release so I can watch it piecemeal. But unlike really good convoluted films, it leaves me weary of it rather than eager to get on with deciphering it.",1018656000,4,2035,4.562841530054645
1438657,5,B00005JKMY,"This movie is along the lines of the matrix and other such movies that carry the metaphor of questioning reality.  It is almost an exact translation from Open your eyes, the movie that it was based on but it has several americanized things and some wonderful lines, such as ""every moment is a chance to make things better""(probobly not exactly right but one of my favorite lines from the movie that really helps to explain the metaphor of movies like this)and some of the witty banter between tom and jason lee.  It is a great movie that most people that I have met that do not like it just can not seem understand it.  It can be somewhat confusing and for some people they may need to watch it several times to truly undertand what is going on which should never be a bad thing in a movie you buy.  It also has a lot of great music in it from radiohead and good performances all around.  And if you get nothing else from this movie remember the all important lesson, if you have a psycho ex girlfriend or stalker, do not get in the car(also carry this metaphor out to other areas as well, not just vehicles).",1018396800,4,1109,4.3125
1438658,5,B00005JKMY,"This film is a thought provoking, intelligent, and all around amazing experience. It amazes me that this was given a mainstream release by Paramount, and I only wish that they would continue to take more risks like this once in a while, because here, the payoff is beautiful. Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre. This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.

I personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS. Why this film did not connect with audiences and critics is the most baffling thing for me to grasp. Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well. Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana. The soundtrack is to die for, and perfectly compliments the mood of the film.

This is a beautiful film. It is a celebration of life, and how ""every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"". I watched this film in theatres years ago, and it made a huge impression on me. I've watched it twice since yesterday.

For those of you who may be skeptical, ignore the negative reviews and watch the film for yourself. Let it wash over you. You won't regret it.",1018396800,,1680,4.6120401337792645
1438659,5,B00005JKMY,"Tom Cruise does and amazing job portraying a confused yet dedicated character in this movie. I fail to see how anyone could say this movie wasn't good. From the moment this movie starts, the plots/sub-plots keep you guessing the entire movie. I for one thought something was happening, and then literally two second later something would happen, and i could just sit there and say, ""What?!?"". This movie is a mind bending rollercoaster that will keep you hooked and interested the entire way though. The plot of this movie is absolutely amazing, and the cast of characters (Tom Cruise, Phenolpe Cruz, Cameron Diaz) makes this movie amazing. If you want to see a movie that will keep you hooked the entire time, and leave you with a sense of guessing, this is the movie. In today's day and age with movies that are made about anything and everything, this movie is definately a welcomed refreshment to the world.",1018137600,6,911,4.772151898734177

I think if you've ever had one of those dreams where you reunite with a long ,lost love on a sunny island, suddenly wake up and realize you're really 65, still single, and the girl in your dream was someone you casually met 30 years ago; you'll have no trouble understanding Vanilla Sky.",1018137600,,461,4.076923076923077
1438661,5,B00005JKMY,"This is an intense thriller that twists the mind and commands you to follow.  From the sweetly toned, ""Open you eyes"" to the final revelation you cannot refuse to be captivated.  The story does not allow you to lead it, you must surrender to it's pace and in doing so you are rewarded with real understanding.
This film offers real insight into life, power and interpersonal relationship.  While it decidedly uses science fiction to deliver the final message the conflict is well grounded.  You must pay close attention to this film to appreciate the details and fully understand it's implications, but it is well worth it.
Rent or buy this film now.  It will move you, and isn't that the point of all art?",1018137600,,706,4.661290322580645
1438662,4,B00005JKMY,"I would recommend Abres Les Ojos over Vanilla Sky.  Penelope Cruz give great performances in both of these films.  However, Cameron Crowe did not change much from the original.  That said, this movie is still good.  One of those reality questioning movies that takes a few good twists and turns that will leave you either confused or thinking you have an explanation, but nobody knows for sure.  That was the original intent, not to answer anything.  This is a solid title with good performances from the entire cast, including two of my favorites, Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz.  Worth checking out.",1017792000,2,598,4.861386138613861
1438663,5,B00005JKMY,"This is not a romance movie. Those who watch it as a romance movie will be disappointed. Apparently the people working for movie times websites didn't know what genre to put Vanilla Sky under. Even though there is a 'love story' inside the movie, I wouldn't go into the movie expecting a romance.
With that said, there is another way to watch this movie. Forget all your ideas of what this movie is supposed to be. Because not all movies are made to depict reality. Vanilla Sky is pure art expression. The scenes, coupled with a great soundtrack, depict something straight from the director/writer's mind. Lots of movies are applauded for technical expertise, which isn't bad. (Like the attention to detail Stanley Kubrick had for his movies. Or Steven Spielberg and his story expertise.) But, 'Sky' doesn't need to be technical. You have to watch it from a different mind set. To love this movie, you must understand what it feels like to be trapped in a dream. You must understand why the main character would make the choices that he did. This is the first movie that has, in my opinion, properly depicted a nightmare. I would almost go as far as putting this movie under science fiction. But, these ideas of lucid dreams seem so real. Another movie that I saw that comes close to the same idea of Vanilla Sky is Jacob's Ladder. I recommend both movies.
One of the only reasons this movie falls short of it's potential is that the script tends to assume that nobody will understand it. The movie, at the end, is constantly trying to explain itself. In that way, the movie tends to stray from it's intent.
Very early in the movie, Cameren Crowe starts to give you the impression that something isn't quite right with the main character. It's not necessarily concrete evidence. It's just this huge exhilarating feeling. I wondered if the movie was really going to turn into the movie I wanted it to be when I was about one-third of the way into it. Then it all unfolded beautifully, as if I was in someone else's mind. I believe Cameren Crowe wanted to express what was in his head. Not that the plot/story was a new idea - it was just that, I believe Cameron understood the story on a higher level than most. I love Crowe for making this movie just as much as I love the movie itself.",1017705600,,2286,4.5375302663438255
1438664,5,B00005JKMY,"Cameron Crowe's re-make of Spanish film Abre Los Ojos is one of the few re-makes that are actually any good.
But it gets better- it's a stunning piece of film.
Whilst many people have given this film low ratings, I have one thing to say to you: THEY ARE WRONG.
Fair enough- the storyline is confusing (especially the ending). You need to see it at least twice to get it. But there's some great cinematography at the start of the film. Perfect editing. Fantastic soundtrack. All you need to do, is Open Your Eyes to see the greatness of the film. You need to make an effort to love it- otherwise, it WILL kick back. In other words, if you don't like it, it won't like you. Once you've seen it already, see it again. The many hidden details that appear are very odd, but also very cool.
And one more thing- I saw this 6 times at my local cinema (theatre). Three times by the end of the opening weekend. I've only ever done that with one film. This one.

1438665,1,B00005JKMY,"I've never been so lost, and so upset about watching a movie. Vanilla Sky starts out as an interesting movie, depicting the spoiled life of a rich little playboy. Cameron Diaz probably does her best acting in this film, and it's a shame it has to be attached to such a piece of garbage.
After Diaz's character runs her car off a bridge, it all goes downhill. We're thrown into a myriad of explanations of what's happened to Cruise's character, and we're never sure whether what's taking place is real or dreamed. The second half of this movie is so convoluted, and so pointless, it's sad. The movie started with a little promise, especially knowing we'd be treated to one-liners from co-starring Jason Lee. However, this becomes a train wreck of a movie, and great actors like Kurt Russell, Penelope Cruz and Lee are wasted. Instead, we're treated to a bizarre trip through the possibilities of what's become of Cruise's character's mind and body. Why the makers of this film thought people would be attracted to such a mess is beyond me. You'll be left with so many questions, and so many ""Why?""'s, it's not funny. This might be the worst movie I've ever seen.
