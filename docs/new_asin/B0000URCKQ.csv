1947930,3,B0000URCKQ,"The Fantasies disc I would give 4 stars and is my far the most erotic and artful--also interesting historical DVD for breast augmentation for models.  Many beach seens, hot tub, and exercise sceens with voluptuous bodies.  The strippers 1-3 portion are ho-hum, but variety if thats what one is looking for.",1359763200,,306,4.980392156862745
1947931,5,B0000URCKQ,"Great DVD that was direct to content and was as expected.  The shipping on time, previous reviews just and unbiased.  Price per item always a plus and reasonable.  Quality of viewing content unflawed.",1344470400,,200,5.0
1947932,4,B0000URCKQ,"I was a little worried when the 1st 3 girls had ""over-inflated party balloons"" but there were some nice natural girls as well.  A good variety overall.  The camera man gets some nice close-up shots.  You get to see every little bump on some of these girls nipples.

The risque factor is prodably slightly higher than Playboy.  The emphasis is on boobs but you get some down below shots as well.  Sometimes they actually focus a little too much on the face with the close-ups.

Some girls are better than others & I wouldn't call any of them absolute top notch but it was an overall good DVD that fit my taste well enough.  3 hours for roughly $5.00 used def. gave me my monies worth.

I actually found the music to be on the boring ""elevator music"" side but there's no commentary so you can easily put it on mute & play whatever you like for a better veiwing experience.  Hence the music is kind of a moot point IMO.  Let's face it, these kinds of things are mainly about the visuals.",1316304000,14,984,4.3224043715847
1947933,4,B0000URCKQ,"This really IS a DVD with plenty of HOT SEXY STRIPPERS!! I was leery of it at first, since there were no reviews or even company info, but I'm glad I got it. I've gotten some other similar DVDs from the company DGD that are good ones, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NUDE-FOOTBALL-BASKETBALL/dp/B00002CGG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NUDE:FOOTBALL/BASKETBALL</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nude-Pool-Party/dp/B00008R9LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nude Pool Party</a>, so that's why I took the chance. I had thought HOT SEXY STRIPPERS would be ladies stripping in clubs, but it's all done one-on-one for the camera. Most are indoors in various rooms, while maybe half a dozen are outdoors. Most of the ladies are very sexy and are good at dancing and stripping. And most of the time there's good camerawork and picture quality, with various rock music tunes going that are decent. Yet there's some inconsistency with this DVD, as, there's a few women here who are not nearly as good at stripping, and in a few cases the lighting or background are off. In several segments, shadows occasionally fall across the dancers, apparently from the equipment or camera crew. But overall this DVD is very good, and is unusually long at about 3 hours, so even with the few disappointing segments, there's LOTS of other great ones! There are 24 dancers, and I recognize several of them from other such videos, such as Cheyenne Silver. And a few of the ladies are so outstanding that I wish I could find more films they've made!",1206057600,28,1617,5.658436213991769

8003282,4,B0000URCKQ,With a title like this it should be obvious what you will see.  The show does live up to the title but don't expect the cream of the crop strippers.  There are some very good looking women but both the women and the cameramen are pretty amateurish at times.  There is plenty of women to check out and a fairly small price so a pretty good deal.,1385856000,,344,4.104477611940299
8003283,1,B0000URCKQ,"Boring.  It appears solely to be an exercise for the one person production team.  He even does the music, which resulted in muting the feature.  The movie in no way lives up to its own hype.  Don't waste your time or money.",1369612800,,223,4.238095238095238
8003284,3,B0000URCKQ,"There are three separate one-hour shows here. Even skipping the first two, which are godawful, this rates barely three stars.

This was produced in the mid-'90s and looks it, which isn't in itself a deal breaker; in fact there are some other mid-'90s releases like this out there that are really, really good. But do expect hallmarks of the period, including emaciated girls, bad hair and poor-quality video.

Let's analyze each word of the title, back to front:

*Strippers. Well, I would say that it's a fair bet that these women were indeed strippers at the time of taping. Yet none of them seem to be able to strip with any degree of skill or entertainment value. Seriously, these are some of the worst dancers I've ever seen who would brazenly label themselves as dancers.

*Sexy. Again, in order to be ""sexy,"" you have to move in a sexy way, not like some awkward fawn who doesn't know what to do with its limbs. On more than one occasion I actually saw these girls stumble while disrobing.

*Hot. There are a total of 24 women over these three presentations. However, with the possible exceptions of Lovette (thank God that she's here), Heaven Leigh and Brittany Andrews, none of them ever commanded much attention on the circuit. There are more pancakes here than at a Denny's restaurant: Tall, skinny women with no butts and horrible implant jobs. ""Trailer-park skanks"" probably would have been a better title; most of them look so haggard in close-up that it actually embarrassed me as a viewer: dark circles under eyes, pock-marked complexions, scars, open cuts (not kidding), stretch marks from childbirth, drug-addict teeth. In fact I had to question whether some of them even had showered before showing up to shoot.

The first two shows are, as mentioned above, terrible, and with the exception of maybe a couple of women (Lovette's being one), you might as well just avoid entirely. By the time that you get to the third show, there are some attractive women and FINALLY some womanly rears.

There is some fair explicit nudity here (a good addition), though it tends to be fleeting and almost accidental. And that's another big complaint I have: the cinematography (I guess that's what you'd call it) is just bad. I wasn't expecting anything great, and I can live with subpar production values; what I can't live with is a photographer who seems to be more interested in capturing images of panties and shoes than actual female body parts. Time after time, this putz zooms in on the woman's hands as she pulls off her underwear...and then just continues to follow the underwear. Darnedest thing that I've ever seen in a supposedly-erotic show. So she's getting completely naked but we don't even see that part until much later, mostly by accident. We're instead treated to an oh-so-titillating long shot of underwear sliding down the stripper's legs, clumsily getting hung on a pair of high heels and then sitting there on the floor for brief moments. Whether the guy is a fetishist or just totally inept at shooting video, it's still infuriating.

So all in all, I can't recommend this for viewing, much less buying, and if there was a rating for something between two stars and three, this would get it.",1364083200,4,3221,4.8014440433212995
8003285,1,B0000URCKQ,"This was a very disappointing DVD.  The quality of the performers and settings pales by comparison with real burlesque type dancers who can move, sell their act and entertain as well as excite or stimulate sexually.  The absence of live musicians and audiences only makes it worse.  Obvious breast augmentation scars in some cases too.  Granted they do take it all off.",1361664000,,369,4.903225806451613
8003286,2,B0000URCKQ,"I have watched it twice. Although most of the women were indeed hot and sexy, most of the scenes weren't. Each scene is about 10 minutes (or less). They dance around or whatever for 3 or 4 minutes before they begin to get naked.  When some of them get naked either the camera shot goes soft and fuzzy or the girl gets into the bubble bath and all you see is her head sticking out of a bunch of bubbles. Yeh, she's naked, but you can't see her. Another one hides in the bushes. The first two hours nearly all the breasts are fake. There were only a couple of very good scenes in the each of the first two hour sections.
The third hour was the best as far as I am concerned.  The camera work was better. The girls didn't hide. The girls even had real boobs. The best scene was just over 6 minutes long. That one featured a porn star, Bobbi Starr, or Bobbi Bliss, not sure or if they are the same. Anyway, she was good.
You could throw out the first two hours and keep the third one and not miss much. But I have seen other stripper videos and I felt the same way about them....Maybe it's just how I am.
One thing I didn't like about the format was it only played one hour then it stopped and went to menu. Then you have to restart it on the next hour.",1360022400,8,1249,4.0120481927710845
