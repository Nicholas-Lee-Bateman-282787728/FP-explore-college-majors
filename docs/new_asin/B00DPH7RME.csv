5841337,4,B00DPH7RME,Great Old Classic Anime!,1416700800,,24,5.25
5841338,1,B00DPH7RME,"Royal Space Force or Wings of Honneamise as it is also known is quite a polarizing film. The film's place in Japanese animation history as the product of legendary Gainax Studio (neon genesis Evangelion) is well docuemented. The story focuses on Shirotsu, a aimless screw up who signs up for the astronaut program. The story can be viewed as being on another planet eerily similar to Earth or as a piece of extreme alternate history. There are plot summaries elsewhere so I won't elaborate here.

I want to start off by saying the film is absolutely gorgeous. The movie is drenched in a warmth that only hand drawn animation can create. Produced in the late 1980s Japanese animation studios were pushing the limits to what traditional animation could create. ""Akira"" would represent the zenith of this era and indeed the genre but on ""royal space force"" Gainax created their own masterpiece film filled with lush and detailed visuals. Each scene is filled with lots of details allowing the audience to see new things with each viewing. Unfortunately, one would only have additional viewings if they liked the film and that is where the problem exists.

Shiro's journey from loser to astronaut is not an easy one. He isn't likeable nor are any of the other sadly underdeveloped characters. Shiro's female friend is a religious obssessed woman who talks often about the creator but passively moves through scenes while bad things happen to her. Her home gets bulldozed. She is nearly raped by the main character. And then she apologizes for stopping the rape. All sorts of bad things. The latter event itself has polarized many viewers regarding this film. For me, in addition to the attempted rape the  biggest issue was that the characters were neither likeable nor interesting and the plot itself was slow, plodding and actually not very enjoyable.

Royal Space Force is an attractive film. Visually it's a treat to look at and one can appreciate its importance in anime. However, the film was a commercial flop and for me I can understand why. It didn't entertain, inspire or inform me personally and it's not a movie I would want to watch repeated viewings. I definitely think one should see this movie at least once and make up their own mind but definitely rent or view before spending money to purchase.",1395792000,7,2309,4.852791878172589
5841339,5,B00DPH7RME,"I'm here to talk about why I feel this movie merits your attention. I'm an anime enthusiast. I've seen plenty of anime to determine a good anime from a bad one. I've learned to appreciate the quintessential ""Akira"", the influential ""Ghost In The Shell"", the pain-stakingly created ""Metropolis"", the truly humane ""Grave Of The Fireflies"", the cerebrally-complex ""Serial Experiments Lain"", the famous ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Redline"", ""Kanon"", ""Clannad"", ""Haibane Renmei"", ""Chobits""....the list is enormous. But the bottom line is that I've seen the best to solidify the meaning of what makes a great anime.

""Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise"" is an anime that did not resonate with me after watching it the first time. It left me wanting something else, and I felt its story was vague and incoherent. Its characters were rather shallow, with no room for us to empathize with them. These were my thoughts after seeing it. But I decided to see it again.

Something inside of me forced me to rethink about my initial reactions. I saw it again, and it got me thinking. It's not a difficult anime to digest. I'm not going to explain the plot since that is something that can be read in other websites. But one particular scene had me thinking a lot: Shirotsugh Lhadatt seeing Riquinna Nonderaiko. He sees how she is handing out pamphlets containing religious material. Shirotsugh dismisses the message she is declaring, but it stays with him. Another scene shows Riquinna again with her effort to distribute her material, and so Shirotsugh (and this surprised me) goes in and assists her, taking some of her pamphlets and handing them out to many walking by.

Something has happened here: Shirotsugh has realized Riquinna's firm stance, her firm decision, and her strong decision in talking about things that, for many, cannot be perceived. He realizes how much faith she has in her effort, and the attitude she displays. She has a clear objective, and here we see Shirotsugh come to terms about the importance of her work.

It's one thing to explain particular scenes as part of this review, but it's another when you see Shirotsugh's transition towards accepting what Riquinni does for a living.

And to view the colorful palette of images and detailed backgrounds when we see Shirotsugh and Riquinna interact...just wonderful. Sure, we might expect so much chemistry from them, but that's not the sole important point. The point is to take every aspect of the film, from the animation to the music to the characters to the story...these are all things that need to be held in high regard.

""Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise"" deserves a place in the canon of the best anime, if ever such canon exists.",1383955200,12,2710,4.919037199124727
5841340,5,B00DPH7RME,"An early and wonderful movie from Gainax studio. Without a doubt this movie is a classic of Pre-CGI hand drawn animation. This is not an action adventure anime.  Do not order this film expecting explosions every ten minutes. It is an existential drama with a Hard Sci-Fi setting. NO it is not appropriate for children. YES it is beautifully animated and thought provoking,in spite of the infamous ""rape"" scene. (Which in no way condones the practice of rape, nor is it particularly exploitative.) I would rank this film among the Titans of anime, like ""Akira"", ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Princess Mononoke"".",1383264000,12,606,4.9411764705882355
5841341,1,B00DPH7RME,"Review of movie:
Guy is in a go nowhere job whist dreaming away his days of flying whether it be awake or asleep. He joins the commonly accepted joke of a Space Force just so he can fly. With his country at war, he shows his cowardice at various points. Can't win a bar fight, failure at combative training at work and flees when confronted on the street.  Hooks up with a religious zealot with a brat of a kid. He tries to rape her and then she blames herself for his actions. Trust me, it wasn't her fault, she's really annoying. The scene demonstrates how pathetic the protagonist is. With each new scene, his outfits get more goofy than the previous.
All of this is in between many the naps he takes.
It is clear that the budget went into the gorgeous visuals and not the soundtrack or story. The visuals are quite elaborate, but the story and soundtrack that simply negates it all. It takes ""annoying"" to a whole new level not seen since Nancy Grace or Rachael Maddow (forehead) got air time.
Yes, people will be upset by this honest take of the movie, but there is no real good defense to these addressed concerns.
""Concerns"" I wish I had known about prior to showing this movie to a class of seven to nine-year olds in my church group here in south Texas interested in the space program. Most of them were speachless (which is a hard thing to do after all that Mountain Dew they drank) upon seeing the movie. In hindsight, it might of been a good thing called ""tough love"" since none of them are Muslim and those are the only ones NASA wants to send up into space anymore as an ""outreach program.""",1382832000,3,1604,4.346666666666667
5841342,5,B00DPH7RME,"This anime movie is worth buying on Blue-ray.  It falls outside of the 2015 ideals of either studio Ghibli type family movies or characters with owl sized eyes falling into predictable categories.  The hand drawn cell animation is detailed and more fluid than the average from the 80's although not completely smooth.  The story is about human beings, with all the flaws included, in an alternate world attempting their first orbital flight.  The main character may start out as a directionless loser but he perseveres through misfortune and personal mistakes in a tale that warrants repeated views.
Not suitable for either children or the childish.  A 9 out of 10 or 4 1/2 *",1447200000,,675,4.885964912280702
5841343,5,B00DPH7RME,"I first saw this movie about 20 years ago. I re-bought it recently to get the current DVD issue (I had an old VHS), and I really wanted to revisit this movie. It's been 20 years and the movie's climax still give me goosebumps.
I was somewhat afraid of the DVD quality because I heard that previous DVD editions were lousy. I want to share this movie with my kids and I didn't want it to look dated. Fortunately, the latest DVD's quality is very good sound and image-wise. I'm fond to Ryichi Sakamoto soundtrack and it sounded great.
The story itself is about an alternative earth history and a group of men who got for the space travel for the first time. Only that nobody really takes them seriously and the group that lands in the Royal Space Force are really the outfields. Kind of an opposite ""right stuff"". What will be then the moving force that powers them to get to space? As other reviewers has stated, the answers is faith. And that's also the reason I wanted to revisit the movie, it reminds me what faith is. Even though I speak about faith in a generic way, the movie approach has a clear religious aspect.
I have to warn you that the movie may seem boring to many people, the first part is all about this ""going nowhere"" group of people, so obviously doesn't sound promising.",1446681600,,1289,4.397489539748954
5841344,5,B00DPH7RME,"In this anime, in my opinion, its charactors and sometims even the backgrounds are moving beautifully, I think you can say this anime was produced by the traditional Japanese craftsmanship, and that is the reason I gave it the FIVE STARS!  However, I wanted the animators and others to have built up more interesting and less bored story for audience, thats all.
While I gave this anime five stars and I confess I shares my country I belongs with them, frankly this anime is for those who have any interests for the history of the world animations development. At that point, however, this anime was produced by the young men at their 20s among whom are Mr. Sadamoto, Mr, Anno( Remember the Evangelion)
 and Mr.,Skamoto (now famous music composer).

I think those who he or she has interest in the pre-production story of the EVANGELION will satisfy his or her curiosity.

5841345,5,B00DPH7RME,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honneamise"" released by Maiden Japan.
What I found so intriguing about this rare anime film is that astronaut Shirotsugh Lhadatt discovers his belief in G_D through the life of a devout young woman that he grows to love through her actions of faith here on earth, and his revelation of the universe as a whole once his space capsule is in orbit.
It's through discovering the G_D of his universe, that Lhadatt grows from an aimless military man with no ambition to one who matures into a man who leads the conquest of space.  The animation is lush, though in rare moments, it does veer off into that funky anime style of the 1980s.
Prude Alert - there is a somewhat violent attempted rape scene in this movie that shows upper female nudity - though shocked, Jeff H. did not turn away; and the attempted rape is stopped with a timely smack on the head with a handy skillet.  Jeff H. did say ""No way.""
Spoiler Alert - for some reason, the ending goes all pseudo-2001 and it detracts a bit from the over all story.
Strongly Recommended for its exploration of faith and exploration.
Five Stars!",1442448000,2,1167,4.5260663507109005

8595904,5,B00DPH7RME,"While the dub can be kinda goofy and the Blu-ray has a few minor visual hiccups, the heart of Royal Space Force is why I love this movie. I bought the product initially upon viewing a YouTube reccomendation of this movie claiming how good the endings battle animation was. While the final skirmish was indeed very well done overall, I cannot say that that is the reason I loved this film, though I will say that the last 10-20 minutes of the film is quite fantastic and prior to viewing the film I had not seen anything quite like it. The characters or character are the real gem here, mainly the main female character and her interactions with our protagonist. I felt real empathy for the woman in this film and loved how the main character became so moved and affected by her lifestyle and beliefs. She is an incredible character. I would rather not go into too much detail and let you, the viewer, experience the film without any spoilers. The ending was fantastic and that is a big part of why when I finished this movie I felt so satisfied yet was given much to ponder. Definitely worth a watch and in my opinion it is worth purchasing.

8595907,5,B00DPH7RME,"Lhadatt, a befuddled slacker who becomes the driving force and public face of a military/scientific enterprise he can barely understand, is the hero of a science fiction satire that seems to be the lovechild of Robert Heinlein and Jim Jarmusch. If the movie's theme -- hard to pin down on the first viewing -- is that people can do the right things for the wrong reasons, then its deadpan blend of dark comedy, big social/philosophical questions, and a technological sense of wonder start to make much more sense.  That's not to downplay the suspense as the launch date approaches, and the sheer physical realness of the busy, rundown, very lived-in world that the characters inhabit.

In a strong cast of individuals, Lhadatt's girlfriend Riquinni -- a dowdy single mom whose religious devotion borders on fanaticism -- stands out as his unlikely muse and guiding light. This 1987 movie is not your typical anime: it has more to say about life, and our choices about what gives it meaning, than you may be used to.",1487376000,3,1015,4.827586206896552

Not going to go into details to much on this one because it's been so long some I've watched it, but this movie is like buying a record or CD back in the day without listening you just know the good ones when you see it, and speaking of music this deserves to be purchased based on that alone seeing it's produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto former member of YMO the Japanese electronic must group who gave us the classic dance tracks Computer games and Behind the Mask.

I was impressed not only by the animation, but also by the rich world developed by Gainax.  Little did I know that this studio would later make Evangelion, long since considered the ""gold standard"" for may anime outside of the venerable Studio Ghibli movies.

I had the DVD which was a very rough and dirty transfer from what I assume was high quality broadcast VHS.  The colors were a little muted and it had some interlacing artifacts.  However, this Blu Ray transfer looks bright and clear, though maybe still a little muted (the movie is pretty old, after all).",1452124800,,714,4.582677165354331
