7883282,5,6305120447,"Let me put this first:  This isn't for children.  Adult anime contains nudity and sexual situations, plus adult topics.  Parents beware, 18 and under should steer clear.
Warnings aside, this is pretty good.  I have the english dubbed version, and they do a pretty good job.  I don't THINK it's been edited, but there is one shot in the second episode that makes me wonder....
Anyways, this high school girl named Yoshida is a pretty cold woman, about 19 years old.  (The dustcover says prominently that no characters are under 19 years of age.)  She has a career as a model, despite the rule about students at her Tokyo school being forbidden to work.  A teacher finds out the truth, however, and is determined to use it to his advantage....until he finds himself at the mercy of a master tease.  Yoshida herself is unbelievably cold-hearted.  She doesn't warm up until episode two, when a new girl, a transfer student named Azumi, awakens feelings in her....deep feelings.  Yoshida's never been in love before, and this confuses her.  And how would her boyfriend react to being dumped for....another woman?  I don't think he'll take it lying down.....
The second episode is what really makes me like this tape.  If you are an adult, it is worth viewing, because, even for anime, it's a different experience altogether.",1007337600,3,1319,4.830357142857143
7883283,5,6305120447,"These two stories of a Master Tease's sexy adventures are playful and funny romantic/erotic comedies. These animated shorts are far more entertaining (and addictive, I want MORE!) than the crass and tasteless T&A ""comedies"" that stuff the live action rental sections of the local Schlockbuster Video Outlet. Why? Because they have heart and a gentle realistic humor that comes from the both characters and their interactions with each other just as much as from the slapstick situations themselves. I cannot recommend these stories more highly.",981331200,,544,5.411764705882353
7883284,5,6305120447,"Boredom and an extra 2.50 make for an evil cocktail, and I ended up renting Strange Love.  Which, I give five stars because there was nudity and sex, and in retrospect, that's all I was looking for anyway.",976233600,4,205,4.394736842105263
7883285,4,6305120447,"This one was pretty strange, and there was quite a bit of lovin' going on, too.  There are two episodes on this tape.  I must say, in the first I  intensely disliked Yoshida, the main character.  She teases this poor  teacher mercilessly, even ruthlessly.  In the second part, though, she  becomes less spiteful and more pleasant.  Overall this was a good anime sex  comedy, but be aware that it is very adult, with much more nudity than most  others.",965347200,3,451,4.594936708860759
7883286,5,6305120447,"This Movie Rocks! I'm not going to describe it, because than I would be to tempted to give the whole dang thing away! That is how good it is. And the cover alone is enough to deserve 3 stars.",964656000,,191,3.923076923076923
