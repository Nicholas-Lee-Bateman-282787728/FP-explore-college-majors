This combination pack is actually cheaper than the two movie packs from which it springs.

Among the real finds in this set are the serials. ""Bulldog Drummond"" is quite amusing, and all but the first one is quite viewable. The Bulldog Drummond series even has John Barrymore with a very good turn as a police inspector quite late in his career. There is the Dick Tracy series, which is also quite well preserved and watchable. Finally there are some of the old Sherlock Holmes films. The earliest of these suffer from some pretty bad fading, but most are OK. Then there are some great individual films including an independent film by James Cagney in the 30's - ""Great Guy"", Mickey Rooney at the center of a film noir in ""Quicksand"", which pretty much says it all about the plot, and the unforgettable noir ""He Walks by Night"" with Richard Basehart that focuses more on the psychology of the criminal and the science of criminology. You know from the start who did it, the fun is in seeing how the cops catch the criminal.  David Manners and even Bela Lugosi show up in a couple of forgotten films with pretty good plots.

If you're into classic stars and great plots, I recommend this. However, do note that there are a few films that are quite faded and their audio is so bad that it makes it difficult to enjoy them.",1238198400,111,1802,5.666666666666667

One-half the movies they were familiar with, while the other 1/2 were unknown to them, so it is a good mix.  One problem with this set is the sound, as mentioned in several previous posts.  Some movies sound great, while others are practically inaudible.  But my main beef is that it does not come with a booklet (that other sets include) describing the movies, so you have no way to know what discs the movies are on, or what the movies are even about.

Like me, you may want to mark the film titles with a Sharpie pen to properly identify them for organization.  Paying about $20 for 100 movies was well worth a bit of my time.

2683109,5,B000K6GM4W,"I have bought several of these multi-pack sets and like them all, this one as well. So far nearly all the movies I have watched in this set have been very watchable quality wise. Back when these were made studios went to a lot of trouble to use correct lighting, even in night scenes. I find this era of motion pictures much more interesting to watch. The actors have individual personalities, the stories have real intrigue and suspense.
Universal and Columbia sold their back lots to condominium developers and moved those lots to some companies hard drive.
It is no wonder today's actors look dumb founded they are doing the scene in front of a green screen not really knowing where they are until the CGI guys fill in the blanks.
The 30's 40's and 50's is where the real quality performances will be found. So pick up these multi movie packs and enjoy.
Many people complain that these movies haven't been cleaned up, so what it just makes the movie more interesting and charming to watch.
The enjoyment is in the actors and the sets and of course quality writing which these movies have in abundance.
We are lucky that companies like Shout and others are making these classic movies available and at a very inexpensive price.
It may not be long before these movies will not be available so get them while you can.",1415750400,2,1317,4.584745762711864

You can't get any better then John Payne in Kansas City Confidential and Dan Duryea in Too Late For Tears. A few reviewers have complained about sound quality on some films and there are one of two where the sound fades low for a second or two but that is a minor complaint.

2683142,2,B000K6GM4W,"The sound track is nearly completely ruined by an an attempt to improve the sound on every Mill Creek collection that I have bought.

Music: To suppress hiss sounds in the high frequencies the music that accompanies the program has been so lowered in volume that you do NOT feel the musical emotion of the film. This makes every single show unnecessarily boring. It took me a while to realize what was going on. I found that on movies that I have duplicate copies by other DVD makers that the sound is much better and the overall effect is dramatically better even though they have more hiss. Hiss is soothing to some people and it is obviously not worth ruining the sound track to suppress it when you compare.

Dialog: It is hard to tell what the actors are saying. Apparently the sound hiss processing makes the sound suddenly go up and down in volume when an actor talks but the high part of the voice is suppressed to eliminate the hiss. This makes every actors voice sound dull and boring and women do NOT sound as feminine as they normally do (you miss the sexy voice of fem fatals). Suddenly you will hear a little more music when the voice is boosted louder reminding you that you are missing the musical sound track thus you are not feeling the emotion of the program.

Story: Some of these are great old B and B+ movies that are worth watching though they are not the highest budget programs so not the best. Sadly they are ruined by the sound processing. As I have said, I have found a copy of some of the movies on other DVD's and they are dramatically better. Sadly rated a 2.",1273536000,7,1590,4.3830508474576275
2683143,5,B000K6GM4W,"If you like old (1930's-40's) crime/mystery movies, and don't mind them being ""B"" pictures you may enjoy this set. A mixture of ""B"" (and lesser studio) movies: some good (for example the 4 Holmes-Rathbone series), some mediocre but still watchable and some when-is-this-thing-going-to-end torturous (for example-the Holmes-Wontner/Owen series.) 5 of the 'movies' are ""Playhouse 90"" style dramas made for earliest TV broadcasts from 1949-50, not theatrical movies at all.

I paid [one-five-dot-eight-six], including shipping for my set (new).

Yes video/audio quality varies; many prints are very contrasty, others dark and muddy. it may help to adjust the contrast and brightness on your set. One movie (Fog Island) I had to listen via headphones through my stereo and adjust the audio equalizer, otherwise the dialog was so unclear I could not understand it. The audio/video quality could have been improved noticeably if Mill Creek had just made some very, very simple video and audio adjustments when they transferred the films to video.

I won't repeat points already covered in other reviews. If you want a taste of what is on the set, go to [lileks(dot)com] and click on '100 Mysteries'. James Lileks is a writer/humorist on a Minneapolis newspaper and has authored several books. He received this as a gift and as of 2009-10 is commenting on a movie a week from the  boxset, with stills from the films and even some very short video clips. Yes, his comments are mainly intended to entertain, having a bit of fun at the expense of some of the films/actors, but he still gives credit where credit is due. It was reading about his slogging thru the boxset a film a week that got me interested in buying the set.",1266019200,28,1715,4.986013986013986

I think I paid $17.xx for this set.  There are 100 movies in the set, though they are on double-sided discs and usually 2 movies to a side.  There are a bunch of really good movies--especially if you like the old classic B&W movies.

Read the description; if that's what you want, buy them.  By the way, the box they come in is handy for storage, and there are mini-reviews on each disc sleeve.

Buy 'em!
