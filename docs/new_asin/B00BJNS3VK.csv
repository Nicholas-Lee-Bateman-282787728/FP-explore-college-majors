It is beyond rediculous, but that is why it is so aweesome. Over the top stories and characters make this show a great time. Funimation I freaking love you! Thank you so much!

5878772,4,B00BJNS3VK,"Move over, Kei and Yuri, the dirtiest pair of all have arrived and they are not messing around.  ""Panty and Stocking with Garter Belt"" (PSG for short) is a madcap exercise in obscenity and hilarity that uses and abuses a semi-American kiddie animation style (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Powerpuff-Girls/dp/B001GU04Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Powerpuff Girls</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Is-Magic/dp/B00803LRTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic</a>) to increase it's own patent offensiveness.  Panty and Stocking are the first names of the Anarchy sisters, fallen angels who are trying to buy their way back into Heaven by defeating earthly ghosts using weapons formed out of their undergarments.  Garterbelt is the perverse afro-priest who plays the Charlie to their angels.  And they are all majorly effed up.  This is an anime for those of you with a truly sick sense of humor. Profanity flies profusely from the mouths of these characters in both English and Japanese (often in the same sentence) as they argue about such topics as the importance of breast size versus perkiness or belittle each other's BDSM techniques like opponents with opposing styles in an old chop-socky flick.  Every bodily fluid known to man comes into play at some point in the series and the flow of sexual humor is nearly constant.  This is not a show for your kids and it is not for the easily offended.  If you have delicate sensibilities at all, leave them at the door when you view PSG.  It will push your buttons with inane regularity.

What do I make of this insanity?  Loved it.  The Japanese voice cast is hilarious (as of this point, I've note heard the dub) and the soundtrack is among the most instantly memorable I've ever heard.  Auto-tuned pop and dance grooves with bits of reggae and even a little speed metal are thrown in to make the sounds of PSG incredibly infectious and full of personality.  The sound effects are spelled out onscreen comic book style, which adds to the stylish visual charm of the animation.  The show is also a humorous cocktail of parody and genre subversion.  References to everything from grindhouse classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2000/dp/B0038SUBEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2000</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanishing-Point/dp/B00013RC8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanishing Point</a>&nbsp;to full-on parodies of Transformers and the zombie films of George Romero make every episode an adventure for experienced viewers.  In a single music video, PSG manages to reference everyone from KISS to Lady Gaga to The Beatles, to name just a few.  This is a very hyper-literate series from a pop culture standpoint, which is impressive for a show that is based around some of the most base and vulgar humor possible.  Where else will you see sperm playing as soldiers in a Saving Private Ryan send-up attempting to storm ""the bush"" like it was Normandy?  Also, whenever an enemy dies at the hands of the sisters, animation is replaced with a real life model of the foe being blown up.  That is awesome.

One thing that stands out as an example of the cleverness of this show is the girls' transformation sequence, among the most dreaded of anime cliches.  PSG parodies this particular standard without allowing it to become the annoyance it is in any other series in very interesting ways.  First off, the normally low-rent chibi animation is replaced with detailed sexualized hi-def hotness as halos appear above the girls' heads and swoop down the length of their body as the angels' Madonna-esque dance groove kicks in, which just plain looks cool.  Panty and Stocking then exchange ridiculously suggestive poses making for a mix of legitimately sweet animation, hilariously obnoxious fan service, and the admitted cheesy enjoyment of the classic anime heroine battle ritual. But only the first episode shows the entire sequence in it's entirety while subsequent transformations show different bits and pieces so it takes up minimal episode time to clear room for more laughs.  Win.  Win.  Win.  This is a great example of how PSG subverts and exploits the appeal of an anime staple while at the same time parodying it.  Best of both worlds, baby.

I tore through PSG in record time.  I just wanted more and more of it and could not leave it alone. But it's not without flaw.  While usually highly episodic in nature, the final episodes of the first season reveal a story arc that the series would have been better off without.  The finale is a bit of a confused mess that brought down what could have been a five star series for me.  Particularly the closing moments of the season were troubling.  The final twist was so random and so nonsensical it felt like it was specifically devised as a metaphorical middle finger to the audience who saw the characters give so many literal middle fingers over the course of the show.  This would have been awesome, but the cliffhanger ""to be continued"" ending implies a second season that will probably be more story driven from the get-go.  And the second that PSG started trying to be anything but minute-to-minute random craziness was the second it stopped being a perfect show for me.  Nonetheless, I am very much looking forward to the upcoming DVD release of this one (I can definitely see a possible Adult Swim slot in it's future) and will definitely be looking forward to more Panty, more Stocking, and even more Garterbelt (afros rule) in the future.

When you watch the first two episodes you might think that but if you continue to watch and reach episode 3 when the Demon sisters are introduced, the show takes off and hurtles far beyond South Park! This show is for adults only due to the language and situations and if you are easily offended do not watch this show. Two sisters are kicked out of Heaven and sent to Earth to redeem themselves. They have to kill ghosts to earn Heaven coins to get back into Heaven. The show is fast, creative, inventive and always changing. Not every episode works but when they do, there is nothing else out there that you can compare this to. This is a Love or Hate show and I love it!",1494288000,,754,4.316901408450704

5878788,3,B00BJNS3VK,"This anime series is definitely not for kids. At best there's quite a lot of sexual innuendo, and very strong... suggestion of sex without actually seeing, well, animation of it. I'm not usually one for crude humor (and it IS crude), but I actually found this quite amusing. I watched in in English just to receive the benefit of cursing, which there is also a lot of. (I don't like crude humor but strong cursing doesn't bother me. Go figure.) Both Panty's and Stocking's characters were ridiculous and complete stereotypes, but it didn't really bother me as the whole point was for humor.

As for the actual story, for one thing, I felt like they focused a lot more on Panty than Stocking. I felt like the addition of the ""dog"" Chuck was unnecessary, and he certainly didn't deserve two episodes to himself. (Which I didn't even bother trying to watch.) My biggest problem was with Garterbelt. I initially liked him, I thought he was funny. But as the story progressed, his character, well, creeped me out. I don't know if they think the idea of pedophilia or borderline pedophilia is amusing, but I didn't think so.

Unfortunately, this detail wasn't shocking as a lot of anime series don't seem to have a lot of boundaries. Most of the time this is good, but there are some certain instances where they shouldn't be crossed. Ultimately, I would say I would watch this series again, though there are some undesirable parts I would skip through.",1472688000,,1447,4.692913385826771

5878800,5,B00BJNS3VK,"Panty & Stocking With Garterbelt is a very fun series with so many jokes crammed in such a short period of time that many times during an episode I have to pause and re-watch the previous screen to catch all the jokes.  This may be just me but I love the character design and the art style of the series it is different than most anime today so I dig almost any design that stands out from the norm.  Be warned, this anime contains humor and language for mature audiences so view discretion is advised.  Again on personal note my favorite episode is (I think) episode seven where two robots that are supposed to be Optimus Prime and Megatron crash into the city.  Panty and Stocking eat the souls of the two robots and transform into those robots from the classic 80s Transformers cartoon.  The entire episode from that point becomes a parody episode of the 80s Transformers cartoon with Panty with an army of autobots and Stocking with an army of decepticons that fight out even ending with a fight with the Fallen from Michael Bay's Transformers Revenge of the Fallen.  Panty & Stocking With Garterbelt is a great series and receives a recommendation from me to go out and buy it.",1461628800,,1182,4.525821596244131

All the English voice acting is top notch, with the likes of Monica Rial and Cherami Leigh.

I was kind of surprised by the packaging of this.  ""2 blu ray discs and 3 dvds"" it lists on the package.  The size of this combo pack is about the width of a standard DVD case, but is short like most blu ray cases.  Surprisingly, they managed to jam 5 discs in here via a hinged tray system.

Despite how Amazon may portray the package, there is no box.  The combo pack is 1 case with a slipcase.  If packaging is important to you (for me, it factors in to my thoughts on my purchase) I'd say avoid the combo pack.  If packaging isn't an issue, the value makes this worth it for sure.  The fact that all the discs fit into 1 small case is a space-saver, if that is important to you.",1454198400,2,793,4.0256410256410255

5878832,5,B00BJNS3VK,"Satire and anime typically don't mix. Sure, occasionally you come across a rare gem such as Ouran, but it's a very small genre. This, is wayyy more than I hoped for. It's a refreshing parody of Western media, made to look like a 90's cartoon from Nickelodeon and has the humor of a PewDiePie YouTube video. Granted, it swears so much that there's a four-minute video edit of the characters saying ""f***"" without any repeats and for most people this show can be considered in poor taste if they're taking it from face value. But, when it comes down to it this is a fantastic show with a soundtrack to match (seriously, you're going to get ""I Want You"" or ""Fallen Angel"" stuck in your head at one point) and something to watch when you need a laugh. The dub is great (one of the few I can tolerate) and the drastic change in art style was amusing. One flaw I will point out though is the characters themselves; I actually found myself liking the demonic sister villains Scanty and Kneesocks better than Panty and Stocking. Panty and Stocking are very uncensored, loud, ""indecent"" (which doesn't bother me at all just trying to make a point) while the demons were more sophisticated, elegant, and so forth, which for me are attractive features that the Anarchy sisters lacked. But, I think that's supposed to further the idea that things aren't always as they seem. The plot itself is basically Supernatural (imagine Panty being Dean and Stocking being Sam genderbent) meets South Park. The're angels sent down on Earth to fight demons and get back into Heaven while simultaneously banging dudes and eating sweets. It has NSFW themes in it and is overall worth every penny (side note- I told my Dad to purchase this for me because I was too lazy to make a Amazon account at the time...

Once you get past the shock factor of the humor it has no real substance or no real anything for that matter.

This is a good watch and forget title..  I picked it up for $25ish  and while it was cheap I was probably better off watching via streaming or some other video service.

Pros..  The Dub...  disclaimer I usually watch subs.. so I am sub guy not a dub fan.  I was told the Dub was really funny..  it was.. amusing
Cons..  No Story..  If you can't take crude humor..  aka.. Drawn Together or something similar then avoid..  Animation Quality..  I expected some of it but the Power-puff girl art style got old quick.

5878835,5,B00BJNS3VK,"Ok look,
I'm just going to come right out and say it, this series is freaking amazing, this is quite possibly the funniest anime I've ever seen. I would totally recommend this if you haven't seen it yet.
The creator of the show got a lot of influence from American culture and you can tell just by watching the episodes like one episode is based on a parody of Transformers, while another is based off of the movie Deathrace.
If you love raunchy comedy like South Park or family guy you will love this.

5878838,5,B00BJNS3VK,"This is a Japanese made ""anime"" that doesn't really adopt the animation style implied by ""anime"".  It is heavily influenced by the Ren and Stimpy, Dexters Lab, Powerpuff Girls, etc. cartoons you would expect from Cartoon Network 20 years ago. Many characters from these franchises make small cameos as background characters.

The series is a mix of action scenes where our two heroes, Panty and Stocking, take down evil ghosts. The ghosts are all creatively designed and have enough variety to keep the series interesting.

The real humor from this series comes from the banter between the main characters. It's a stream really well delivered pop culture references and sex jokes. They're all very varied and well paced, so you won't get bored of the humor.

This set contains the dub and the sub. Funimation did a stellar job with the dub. Every one is well voiced, so there's no ""weird VA syndrome"" that happens when you watch a series subbed then dubbed.

If you're unsure if this series is for you, the first two episodes are legal to stream from Funimation's YouTube channel.",1437609600,,1080,4.8478260869565215

5878870,4,B00BJNS3VK,"A funny show, but it's very episodic. The plot loosely fallows that Panty and Stocking are angels kicked out of heaven for being lazy slutbags. They work with Garterbelt a gay black priest to defeat evil ghosts to earn coins that will grant them passage back to heaven. For the most part that piece of the story doesn't matter as there are only a few key episodes that seem to even fallow a story line. Most of the time you will just be in it for some laughs and funny/erotic animation shifts. As with most gainax anime this doesn't shy away from taking fun shots at anime and the fanbase.

I would say this is a good show to try and get adults who aren't into anime possibly interested, at least so long as they enjoy things like south park, family guy, simpsons, etc.  The show I think may be on par with Black Lagoon for dropping the F bomb the most times.",1418774400,3,859,4.263803680981595

But man, the entire story of this series is boring, and the animation is so incredibly HORRIBLE that it makes even South Park look good. Seriously, it's the sloppiest animation I've ever seen. Now I'm stuck with the burden of trying to sell it because I seriously HATE IT. I wish that the animation was at least as good as Drawn Together was. There's no excuse for cartoons/anime like this.

You don't see very many adult cartoons/anime like this, where every other word is an F-bomb, and some truly gross things happens in some episodes (like one particular episode involving....boogers. Ugh). It's a shame that it was so poorly done, and that the stories couldn't have been better.

Also, the voice of Stocking is annoying. She sounds very similar to the obnoxious voice of Toot from Drawn Together. Just not as extreme. In fact, I was thinking it was the same voice actress (Tara Strong), but it's two different people. Weird. Overall, don't waste your money on this unless you're a fan of atrocious animation.",1416182400,,1123,4.724489795918367

5878889,5,B00BJNS3VK,"Panty & Stocking is the greatest cartoon series of all time. Some of the highlights are the constant stream of dirty jokes and profanity (yay!), the variations in animation style (from classic chibi to classic anime to very modern anime), and the fast-paced blur of background elements that require multiple viewings to appreciate or even notice. The villains are all disgusting freaks with fetishes or are sentient manifestations of humanity's worst bodily functions, and they all die using crude clay models and real explosives.

The underlying story of the fallen angels trying to destroy enough evil to make it back to heaven, only to be constantly hindered by their sex and sugar addictions (plus drinking, profanity, and general disgust for people in general) is funny in its own right. But honestly, the concept would not make it very far without the incredibly sly use of the elements listed above. For such a crass show, it is remarkably sophisticated and almost guarantees repeat watches in order to really observe everything that's happening.

Five stars would be an absolute minimum for this show.",1392508800,,1109,5.121546961325967

Jaime Marchi is just as great as ever, ever since I first heard about her from Strike Witches. Chris Sabat was great as well. and this is first time I ever heard of Monica Rial who which by the way has a very unique voice for voice acting.

The original studio that animated requested funimation make this show as vulgar and offensive as possible without complete censorship in North America, well, Funimation did it and they made an amazing Dub. The characters are snappier and sharper in english, its all around funnier, and voices although great in both,t he Dub just sounds right.

This comes with the original Japanese audio as a selection with subtitles though, so if you are ultra weaboo, there ya go. Buy this, both versions are hilarious and the animation is cute, also there's an episode which is reminiscent of Tokyo Gofathers or Tekkon Kinkreet which really has an odd slow pacing, but its rather neat to see in the mix of all the flashy bright colours.

At any rate, its very vulgar, cheap obvious in your face comedy such as; ""I have the biggest entrances in the entire school!!""

In many ways this series plays out like a more ""mature"" (well, more adult, but hardly ""mature""...) version of Dav Pilkey's Captain Underpants novels. This series follows the adventures of two angels on Earth, one of whom is a nymphomaniac angel who has promised to herself that she will sleep with a thousand men, and the other of whom is a sarcastic goth with a sweet tooth. Confronting a rogue's galley of insane villains (including poop itself, and later on their main antagonists, a pair of lesbian demons), Panty and Stocking's scenarios provide all manner of laughs and beautiful, glorious fan disservice. Highly recommended. Would love to see a second season.",1380067200,,744,5.056910569105691
5878904,5,B00BJNS3VK,"Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt...

The story of two foul-mouthed angels that were kicked out of heaven for bad behavior and have to brutally kill ""Ghosts"" to gain money to buy their way back.

You know, I actually bought this on a whim. I had no idea what I was getting into and yet now I've started a little craze of it around here with all of my buds. I've even gotten guys who aren't into anime at all to really love this. Not surprising, though...considering it's hilarious.

It's certainly not for those who don't consider profanity funny. This show is loaded with it and I promise you that you'll probably find at least one part of it that will make you cringe. It's vulgar, rude, crude, and outlandish, but if you come to love it...that's probably why you love it. It dares to be as naughty as it can be and really, that's kind of impressive considering how hit and miss that can be with audiences in this day and age.

It has loads of references to pop culture, games, movies, you name it. It loves to make fun of American culture in general, though. That much is blatantly obvious. I find that funny, though. I won't give out all of the references they make, since that'd ruin the surprise...but some are really obvious and others are barely noticed. Makes it interesting to watch it again and see what you missed.

This isn't a show for someone who wants a very interesting story. The story is interesting to me, but for most it's hard to understand upon watching. It's really not meant to be loved for the story, but rather the comedy and characters themselves.

Speaking of the characters...The characters are all very unique in this and the dialogue between them is the best I've ever seen in an english dub. It's so fluent and delivered perfectly. Makes the already vibrant characters even more vibrant. The english dub is far better than the sub on this one, for sure. Both are good, but trust me when I say that you have to hear the dub to understand why so many love this show.

One other thing that I adore this show for is the music. Good lord...It has the catchiest songs I've ever heard in an anime before. Every time ""Fly Away"" plays, I have to start bobbing my head. Can't help it. I'm tempted to buy the soundtrack, honestly. It's hard to describe what it's like, though. You'll have to listen for yourself to see. You can tell that they put a lot of work into the music and it's definitely appreciated.

The colors and artstyle were made to mimic western cartoons like old school Power Puff Girls or Invader Zim. Things of that nature. If you're someone like me that grew up watching those shows, this feels like an adult version of those shows. Nostalgia overload. It's great to me, but for the more traditional anime lover...that might be an issue. The transformation scenes are traditional anime, though. More like what Gainax typically does. They're all really well done, regardless.

This show does have a lot of comedy, but I dare say it has it's fair share of action too. It's over the top and comical, but some of it is quite impressive to me. Especially on my personal favorite episode; ""Les Diaboliques."" I might just be easily impressed, but it can be quite a wild ride at times if you're into that.

All in all, I'd recommend this show to anyone that wants hours upon hours of laughs and it's a blast to watch with that best bud of yours that you share your dirtiest jokes with. Just keep this one away from the younger ones. It's way too much for them, trust me. It may look like an old kid's show, but it isn't in the slightest.

It's become my second favorite anime and that's not something I say lightly.",1379635200,,3647,4.469172932330827
5878905,5,B00BJNS3VK,"my girl friend introduced me this show  thru her stocking figure , watched 3 episodes then decided to buy the DVD while I can

for starters this show has a freakin amazing English voice cast that really enjoy more than the JAP DUB ( which is rare  )

when I watch it in English it makes me believe its one hell of an American cartoon because they really nailed the voice acting  also the art style of the show ( same thing goes on how the ghosts die and how amazingly funny its shown in the extras DVD included  )

I have to note for being a cracking show  I must warn of the strong languages in this show ( or Panty in General  )  LOL

each episode is crazier then the other ( probably the whole show  )

the whole cast are really funny most of the time ( again panty takes the show her own way )

the most amazing thing is its an anime but looks cartoony which makes it a GEM in my collection

I deeply wish they make a season 2 of this",1379548800,,938,3.9148936170212765

5878907,1,B00BJNS3VK,"The limited edition box is very attractive, and the art style, writing and direction throughout is very unique and catchy. Frankly though I'm not a fan of the show at all, despite how optimistic I try to be. Neither Panty nor Stocking are compelling as characters and their lines make obvious they are intended to be more a manifestation of teenagers' imaginations than real human beings. This is a Saturday morning cartoon network type anime aimed at kids rather than to thoughtful adults, or even semi-thoughtful teenagers/young adults. The characters are not relate-able or believable or likeable. Some of the supporting cast are tolerable - Garterbelt is awesome and likeable actually - but in the end this is a show about Panty and Stocking and both of them SUCK (Not literally. Well I guess Panty sucks literally).

Yamada's First Time (B Gata H Kei), Baka and Test (Baka to Tesuto to Shokanju), Cat Planet Cuties (Asobi ni Iku yo) are just a couple examples of anime with similarly straightforward plots and cliched, overused devices --- the difference is all of those shows are so well-rounded that they ca find success with all demographics and are infinitely more entertaining. As I write this I realize those shows are not the same genre as Panty and Stocking because Panty and Stocking is a kids show. The sexual humor won't put you off but the shallowness of it will, the unskilled writing.

Think ""Archer"" without the wit, just the arrogance and crass. Think ""Ren and Stimpy"" without any mystifyingly adorable/redeeming nose-bleeds. I just cannot express how juvenile Panty and Stocking is. It sucks. It sucks terribly.",1378684800,,1633,4.978021978021978

But the thing is, this show is meant to suck, and that's what makes it so great. If you appreciate extreme bouts of irony and cheesiness covered in a thick coat of offensive comedy, then you can appreciate this show. It's stylish character design really speaks to me and the generic Saturday morning kids show plot line furthers the sick irony and cheesiness with this show. It is not a kids show, yet it looks like one.

The one thing I would like to say though about the Blu-ray version, the menu design is crap...the quality n' junk is lovely, special features, great...but the menu...it's got problems. First, the text is so tiny I could barely read it when sitting only a few feet from my tv. Also, the fount is hard to read. The biggest problem however, is that the color of the text will blend in with the flashy, alternating, seizure inducing background, so you can't even see it at all till you wait for the colors to die down.

All in all the show is pretty good if your into corny stuff, but if you don't know you should probably just rent it or preview a couple episodes before buying.",1368662400,2,1227,4.307359307359308

The people I heard ""it's good"" from, were wrong; it's amazing!  Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt delivers all the profanity and derisive language you could possibly want and still provides some kind of story line.  If one were to combine sex, swearing, violence, and ""vulgar language and situations"" all in one nice neat little package with some Powerpuff Girls style art, they would have Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt.  This isn't one I'd recommend watching with kids or anything like that because of the aforementioned situations and language.  This anime is DEFINITELY not for someone who gets upset over people who use ""vulgar language"" because believe me, profanity is the meat and potatoes of the dialogue in this anime.

The plot is simple, Panty and Stocking, the Anarchy sisters, are Angels that eliminate evil spirits from the world through mandates sent from heaven via lightning bolts into Chuck, their pet-like imbecile of a creature.  Garterbelt is a priest who tries to keep the girls at least active in their duty to kill evil spirits and earn heaven coins so that the girls may return to heaven someday.  Panty loves sex, Stocking loves sweets, and neither one of them has any real self control.

If you like foul mouthed angels with super powers, action, comedy, and fan Service then you'll like this show. However I would say I loved it not liked it. An example of the kind of humor you'll find is like in Episode 8 ""Of the Dead"" when heavenly weapons have no effect on the zombies so Panty mentions a gun shop across the street but sadly turns out to be an adult shop! This upsets Stocking who says Great!, now we are trapped again. What can we find that can possibly help us?! Panty replies, ""Something new to stick up your butt!"". So, if this would make you laugh you might want to checkout this great show.

Maybe that works if you're in Junior High, but for the rest of us, you need to actually add humor to it, _then_ it's hilarious. Didn't laugh once.

And to add insult to injury, the animation is just ridiculously bad. I don't mean the ultra-simplistic art style - that I don't mind (and kind of like). I mean they do as little animating of the artwork as humanly possible (lazy), so it winds up looking like some paper puppet show an eight-year-old could do.

Obviously, you could say the same of Shin-chan; but the difference is, they made Shin-chan funny enough to compensate. That just isn't the case here.

From GAINAX comes yet another over-the-top original story fit only for GAINAX. At first blush this can fall into the ""magical girl"" genre, but only in the loosest (ha!) of terms. This whole show is will be in your face from the get go. The jokes are crude and the language even cruder. If that's not your thing, then stop reading here. If you can bear it, then let this show take you on a ride of laughter and entertainment.

The setting is pretty straight forward. Angels need to collect some coinage to get back in the good graces of Heaven (an attempt at irony there). While the deed itself could be ""simple,"" this particular pair of angels seems dead set on finding ways to commit every sin possible along the way to achieve that goal.

Luckily for us, the audience, this phase goes out after about the third episode. Yes we get it, GAINAX could pull all the stops and bludgeon us on how ""extreme"" the anime media can get will keeping it tasteful. From there, the studio exercises more creativity in their stories and punchlines, hedging on contemporary topics, and you get the sense, as more coins are collected, the grander story coming out. Particular highlights for me were ""Vomiting Point,"" ""Les Diabolique,"" ""Ghost: The Phantom of Daten City,"" and ""Help! We Are Angels.""

Animation style, I can't think of any similar to that except of that of a certain PPG, D's L, and SJ. For its part I wholly enjoyed how it played up to that kind of simplified, bold-lined, work for this type of show. It's a plus because you can't really screw up the quality as the show starts looking at the budget for ways to cut corners and deal with deadlines .

I haven't watched this show for the subtitles, so I can't review on that. But the dub I have no complaints. Swearing like a sailor is not a task all that difficult for this experienced crew of voice actors.

I didn't laugh once through the entire series. The episodes are largely monster-of-the-day scenarios with the ""ghosts"" embodying every conceivable bodily excretion. The dialog was 90% cursing. Now if you think that swearing is funny, then this series was F-ing hilarious. Otherwise you'll be S-O-L.

5878945,4,B00BJNS3VK,"Okay, first things first: how much you enjoy this is going to depend really heavily on your tolerance for profanity and sex-based humor, because this show consists of almost nothing else. It was basically created for two reasons: as a massive Shout Out to western animation in general, and to give the censors an aneurysm.  90 percent of the show consists of vulgar, profanity laden humor.

That said, even though I personally don't care for that type of humor much, I think PSG pulls it off most of the time.  As far as I'm concerned, I think the dub cast did a very good job with the comedic timing (I definitely enjoyed the dub more than the sub).  The animation is also top notch; it's extremely vibrant and dynamic and the occasional stylistic switches are usually funny as well as showing off the animators' ability.  The background music is almost entirely awesome as well.

Not that the show doesn't make a few missteps, some of the episodes go into overkill with the vulgar elements to the point that it overshadows the real comedy, and obviously some of the jokes are going to fall flat.

Long story short, if you have a high tolerance for vulgarity it's worth checking this show out, but if you're easily offended you should probably give this one a wide berth.",1349395200,5,1272,4.626666666666667

5878951,4,B00BJNS3VK,"I don't review anime sets I've purchased based on whether I liked it or not anymore.
Let's talk quality, okay?

First off, if you like or dislike P&S, great. That's great for you. I enjoyed it, myself- I enjoyed it enough to buy the dub! So what does this dub have? Quality! Typically it's hard to translate comedy in Japanese and keep the same punch it delivers- but P&S does a great job of localizing and adding slang to the dialect. Other than that, the voices are actually... decent? Well, except Garterbelt. That's a whole other story.

ON TO THE ACTUAL ITEM! It comes in an amazingly colorful and pretty cardboard artbox that holds two DVD boxes! Wow- imagine that, an artbox! I'm a sucker for artboxes, especially since they're in such short supply, so this rubbed me JUST the right way. DVD extras are also in a decent supply! With a gallery of ghost explosions, well made menus, and more!

Oh- also, the music in this series is simply amazing. Go buy the soundtrack.
But yeah, all in all, I loved this release. It's a step in the right direction and another few steps that follow. Good jawb FunnyMayShun.",1346803200,,1113,4.555

Usually they screw up really good anime when they do English versions of it. 4Kids version of One Piece for example. But I decided to shell out $40 for this product and came to a conclusion. $40 very well spent! They didn't change an ounce of story or humor in this anime. If anything they added more humor with the English dubbing. They picked perfect actors, the animation is unique, the quality is superb, and the humor, randomness, and insanity never stops. I would pay another $40 just to see this ALL OVER AGAIN!!! It's like a XXX version of the Powerpuff Girls. I highly recommend this product to any anime collector or if you just wanna have a laugh.",1346198400,,814,4.469798657718121
5878955,4,B00BJNS3VK,"At first, When I was told about this series, and that it was by the studio, of Gainax (Creators of FlCL, Gurren Lagaan, And Noen Gensis Evagalion) I was excited and couldn't wait to watch it, but after seeing the animation, with, I decided to lay my hands of this series.

But after seeing how many peole reccommend it and seeing, the transformation scene,  following  that Funimation had actually pick it up I decided to give it a shot. Turns out don't just a book by it's cover.

The plot which I was confused about at first turn out that these 2 girls, known as Panty and Stocking, were kick out of heaven for their behavior and the only way to get back into heaven was to beat a monster and recieve some heaven coins. (Kind like Puff Power girls and Super milk chan- but gone bad)
All the main charcters Are Panty: A girl who uses her panty as a tool, that transforms into a gun to fight the monster. She also sleeps with many characters in the series, and really doesn't care what others think of her.

Stocking, A  girl that kind of glothic looking. she, like Panty uses a Stocking that turns into a Sword to fight. She unlike Panty seems to be more dependable on her missions.

Gaterbelt- a Black afro priest, that seems to care for Panty and Stocking. (though it doesn't seem that way in the english dub) He (kind of like the mayor in PPG) gives them missions on the monster that they have to kill. Which nboth seems to not care for. He was also a past that of a villain, which I won't go to far on that.

Chuck-A green pet, that seems to hang around Panty, Stocking and Gaterbelt. It seems that whenever they are in trouble, he sometimes steps in to fight as well. He can also drive the See-through which is a pink car they drive.

Brief- A boy that is in love with panty. He is treated cruely by the group which Panty and Stocking call him ""Geek Boy"". Is true identity is reveal later in the show.

Each episode has 2 part, which sometimes can be very different, like the powerpuff girl, some with different animation, and a lot of refrences to many other shows, epsically in America (Chuck kind of looks like gir from Invader Zim, High School Muiscal, Sex in the City, Back to the Future, and so on) which it very random and doesn't usually continue on from the privous episode. And according to the director of this series, a lot of this was based on randomness or rather ""should we try that or how about this,"" So like for Exmaple the zombie Episode which included all of the characters being turned into zombies in the end, never continues on after that. Cause in the next episode, they are all back to normal.
No for many poeple that always concern themselves by this. ""Is the dub any good?"" Some may find it horrible, some might find it good. To me, I think funimation done a great job on the cast.

The packaging was  great. My was suppose to be Limited Edition but as another review had said, it didn't come with the Heaven Coin. So make sure if you want that, get it on Rightstuff. You'll probably get it early and with the limited edition stuff if you order it from there.

Extras Include, Trailers, Monster documentaries on how they created the blowing up parts when they were destory. Some shorts that were conclusion and extras from some episodes in the seires. And original Japanese and English Trailers to the series.
Now my However part....is the script writter in this series.  Like I said the dub is great. Love how they were cast. My problem in the show is the profanity that was used countless times in the show. Don't get me wrong I don't mind the profantiy, however Funimation just seem to overuse to much. Like When they kill a monster. In the Sub they say ""repent!"" but the Dub the say ""Repent MotherF****r"" which to me makes it hard to watch it, a much less to the Sexual parts in this show, which there is a lot. The sub version use the profanity a lot but not clearly as much as the dub did. That to me was a problem while watching it. Which my older sister, seem to have that same problem.

I heard many spoilers about how it ends so I knew that would happen. But as I watch it, it actually was ok to me. i mean this was based off of randomness so as what might happen in the second season (if there is one) Might start with Panty and Stocking being back to normal or not even with them in the series in the first place. But I guess we'll wait and see.

To me the series was great, Funny, random and awesome to watch. I recommend this to anyone that was into that cartoon, action comedy that they all miss and love.",1345852800,,4553,4.295215869311552
5878956,4,B00BJNS3VK,"I might as well get into the part where I mention something about the Japanese vs English dubbing before anything else since that seems to be a massive issue. Now, bear in mind that in the English dubs tend to differ greatly in the translation of animation. That said don't expect the dialogue of the English version to be the same as the Japanese version. What seems to be a huge difference between the two dubs is the amount of profanity, which is more prevalent in the English dub in earlier episodes. If you don't like the massive amount of profanity or if you happen to be some otaku fanboy who enjoys being a purist, you might easily be turned away from the English dub. Speaking of otakus I think it should be pointed out that most of the Engrish scenes, like the one in the zombie episode, got a change in the dialogue(which I don't mind, since Engrish sort of bothers me in VA most of the time). On a brighter note on the English dub I think it's safe to say that some of the scenes in English like the ""ARE YOU ON A DIET?"" scene actually are actually funny if not slightly better than the Japanese dub. Lastly the VA in the English dub is fine for the most part. It's not the best voice acting but it's bearable.

Animation wise, the style of this specific show parodies American animation. As you'd expect, you may find the art style for P&SwG extremely similar to the Powerpuff Girls and may find several references or similarities to certain cartoons or shows you probably watched as a child (Ren & Stimpy, Tex Avery Cartoons, Power Rangers, etc.) as well as a ton of pop culture references. So if you happen to be a fan of American animation you may like this show.

Lastly, the music of this show is priceless. A mixture of different genres in each piece actually work for the show in certain scenes, and it doesn't disappoint.

Overall, Funimation didn't do a perfect job with this one. However it's good enough where it could be a worthwhile watch to several people. Unless you're some Japanese purist otaku who thinks that Americans ruin everything translating everything into English. It's really a hit or miss translation so don't expect it to be a purchase that will be great, but don't expect it to be a buyers remorse ether. You may have quite a bit of fun watching this show.",1344988800,,2299,4.469047619047619
5878957,5,B00BJNS3VK,"This is an English dub that surpasses the Original Japanese audio.

This is in the realms of Cowboy Bebop in terms of it's English Dub.
Loved the show the first time around, watching it again in English was even better. And slightly different!",1344556800,,373,4.753846153846154

If you watch with subtitles and original Japanese soundtrack then it's not as bad, but the English dialog is even more vulgar and profane.  When the main characters excrete profanities in English while the rest of the dialog is in Japanese -- it feels like they are just showing off, being cool.  When you hear and endless stream of English profanities -- they are not being cool, they are simply base.

I have no idea who the intended audience for this show in US is supposed to be.  The characters are completely unrelatable -- bratty, inconsiderate, shallow, selfish and rude Angels with a typical over-inflated sense of entitlement.

5878960,5,B00BJNS3VK,"So, where to start with Panty and Stocking. Pretty much this Gainax had went on a no-holds-bar mission to create the most rauchy-humorous animation that is borderline hentai. This show though is completely amazing though even with the amount of cussing, sex jokes, and crude humor. Panty and Stocking is literally a homage to all of Western animation that appears on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, but adding an anime flare to it as well.

Ok, so the story line is not one of the world's most amazing plots nor is it anything special. The angels Panty and Stocking have to find ghosts to kill and get their heaven coins in order to pay their way back up to heaven. Just about every episode involves the girls fighting different ghosts almost each episode. The bizarre part? Almost each ghost is very gross (From poop to vomit) or perverted/sexual (Panty stealing ghosts to semen). The story grows into a little more depth in about episode 6, but still has a few episodes that follow the beginning plot.

As some people have mentioned, the characters are not exactly likeable. It is kind of true. Panty is the typical whore, Stocking is a sweets lover, and Garterbelt is a wild reverend. They all have their own little oddities to each of them and make them enjoyable to me. The enemies each all have their own little quirks to them as well.

Those that are reading this review are probably asking: ""WHY THE HELL DO YOU GIVE THIS 5 STARS!?""

Yes, plot wise and characters, they are not the greatest. But, it's how Gainax approached this anime is what makes me give it 5 stars.

CHARACTER-WISE: To be honest, I do not think any characters on Western cartoons are really likeable and do not have as much depth to them as would how animes try to portray characters. Western and Eastern animations are probably just as different in character and story development in that sense are they to art style. Look at Powerpuff Girls. I love that show, but think about the characters. Blossom is the most intelligent of the three and is leads the three in almost everything. Bubbles is the cutesy one that is afraid of a lot of things. And Buttercup is the tomboy rough and tough of the three. But, they do not develop character any further than that throughout the entire show. They follow that same formula of their character. Panty and Stocking stay pretty much their selves as they were created. If you looked at this show from an Eastern viewpoint, yes kind of bland and don't evolve in character such as shows like One Piece and etc. Remember, Gainax only made this show 13 episodes.

EPISODE-WISE: Yes, every episode follows the same routine. The Angels go out, kill the ghost, and get a coin, the end. Once again, follows a more Western animation view.
Fairly Oddparents: Timmy makes a wish, it goes wrong, he fixes it, the end.
Ed, Edd, and Eddy: Eddy thinks of a plan, the Eds try it, they fail.
How are these any different than to what Panty and Stocking is attempting? These two are widely well-known among both Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon fans and are considered classics from both. Gainax went from their overly-complex crazy stories into trying to make their little tribute to Western animations but throwing in a wave of vulgarity. This is why I really do not complain too much about the episode plots.

VISUAL and MUSIC: This is probably where I love this show to death. The art of the show is amazing to me. I always loved the very poppy and bright colors of the show. Gainax really did try their best to make a new style and it shows. Even though you can tell it is a Western influenced style, Gainax created a style that is always going to be known as the PSG style now. Some people complain the animation is kind of ""meh"" and not the greatest. We have to still kind of look at this as a Western animation still. Gainax is using a whole new style that is really 2D-ish in comparison to their other shows. I am not sure what other animation company creates extreme action scenes such as this show and other Gainax classics. Gainax is using a style that fuses both their art and animation style with Western-influenced  designs to still keep the action in the show. They have extended out of their comfort zone of their traditional style that they use in almost all of their animes and created this show. Also, I love the music in this show. They use Electro music and not scores like other shows use. The music in the show can work as clubbing music and it fits in the show perfectly.

Even though these reasons make me love the show, I know many are still turned away by the vulgarity. I have not heard the Funimation dub, but from what I heard, they threw in many more F-bombs in the dub. It seems like they did a Shin-chan to Panty and Stocking, which I did not think it was exactly possible. I believe that is why Amazon claims it makes South Park sound like a boys choir. As much as I hate to agree with many, I am pretty sure the sub is better than the dub. This show is no Gurren Lagann, but the art and action in the show make me love it. I think the main challenge for many is getting over Gainax's ambitious raunchy ideas (Which I believe is still very clever how they executed everything). Remember, it's Gainax. They define the idea of animation that the impossible is possible and the imagination has no bounds.",1344038400,3,5335,4.508790072388831
5878961,1,B00BJNS3VK,"I saw PSG on Crunchyroll and thought it was hilarious and so well done.  Not an anime for everyone, but funny as all get out.

Tried Funimation's version and nearly cried.  They screwed up not just the subbing (subtitling is not well done) but dubbing - the English cast and translation is horrid!

They took what was a trashy show and threw it to the bottom of the gutter.  There were more f-bombs in the 1st episode of the English translation than just about the whole original series.  It lost is humor after 5 minutes.  So sad.

The original cast was 100 times better. I don't think the folks at funimation even speak the original language if this is how they translated the sub-titles.  Pathetic.

*sigh*  Poor Panty, poor Stocking...poor Garterbelt!  I didn't even get to Brief.  *sigh*

At least the soundtrack rocks.",1343865600,7,824,4.671328671328672
5878962,4,B00BJNS3VK,"First of all, I did not finish the original Panty and Stocking anime. Perhaps the western style animation threw me off, or I thought myself above a lowbrow anime such as this. About episode 2, I stopped watching. At the time it, it perhaps simply did not interest me. It was a lot of slinging or sex jokes and insults. I decided to give it a second chance and went ahead and bought the box set.

The box alone makes the purchase worthwhile. Most companies throw together anything for the box, but this one was nice. The outside was sturdy and thick, and had a really colourful outside. Even the slip I put on my wall, that's how creative it was. The DVD slips were just character poses, but still high quality nonetheless. The inside was the best part. Such a nice array of colours, so appealing to the eye. How many companies actually make sure the DVDs themselves look nice? The heaven coin, of course, is nice and simple. A good trinket to put on your desk.

Now onto the actual product. The menu screen, thank goodness, does not play the theme song. This is a minor pet peeve of mine, but whenever a TV set plays the theme song, that's played every episode, on the menu, that just irks me. Another note, they actually split the episodes into chapters! But only over the theme song. Thank God! Straight into the episode, though the theme is nice and short anyway, so I don't mind watching it.

The anime itself: The first two episodes, I enjoyed thoroughly. It's a bit like Powerpuff Girls -- on crack. Yes everyone has made that joke, but it holds true. Quick wit, many (less than painful) puns, and some once in a while funny innuendo. Then part 2 of episode 3 comes along. And episode 4. I thought I almost remembered why I dropped it. These episodes must have changed directors, because they traded quick wit and less than painful puns for blatant, in your face innuendo and gross shock factor. I'm not kidding, one episode solely revolves around characters picking their nose, which may not seem as bad as episode one, which had one of the main characters covered in shit, but trust me when I say it's a different kind of gross. Then episode 6 comes along and BAM we're back to less sex jokes and much quicker wit, as well as a slew of pop culture references. Not to mention quite funny fourth wall jokes. I also enjoyed part 2 of episode 5, but that had less humor in it. The rest is also pretty good, especially the ending. The music, of course, is universally praised. Even if you're not a techno fan, I know I'm not, it's quite good.
This isn't an anime you go in for the plot. You go in for the stupidly hilarious characters and for the humor. If you're into MA, toilet humor, and obscenity then the anime itself is for you.

Now for the dub. Holy mother of Mary and everything above, a good dub. The translation is a bit blunt, but done quite well. The voice actors themselves are near perfect -- well, in actuality their only slightly above pretty good, but that for dubbing standards is phenomenal. Plus they do fit their roles quite well. Even the supporting actors such as Brief do an excellent job. They especially do a nice job with humor scenarios, delivery insults quickly and naturally, sounding like jabs between friends, even if they are technically sisters, so it fits.

The extras were also nice, my only gripe being that you don't have all the songs.

Now that I've praised it, time for my minor nitpicks, mostly around the importing itself. First of all, no commentary, that being one thing I look forward to on movie or anime dvds, I was a little disappointed on that right. Second, and this is a very tiny nitpick, they had the 2nd and 3rd dvds in the same box. I can't help but feel DVD 3 would have fared better in its on box with a slip featuring Garterbelt and Brief. The voice acting, at times can get a little shoddy, like they inserted trials for the voices into the anime itself. And the menu on the third DVD was a bit messy, having to click next to reach all the extras.

Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt is not an anime for everyone. It certainly was an experiment and almost like a Gainax response to Teen Titans (a cartoon network production that heavily imitated anime) imitating western humor, only doing much better than your standard Comedy Central product. It has a brilliant quick humor, though it may not be for everyone. It'd get an 8/10, but for a giant drop off in episodes 3.2, 4, and 5.1, I have to give it instead a 7/10. It was entertaining, and even at 13 episodes, for the beautiful box, better than normal voice acting, and the irreverent humor, makes this purchase worthwhile.",1343260800,14,4640,4.464622641509434

This series doesn't have any naked-boobs, and rarely has underwear shots (on the characters, I mean. Panty removing her underwear to use as a gun doesn't count), surprisingly.

This series is HILARIOUS, leaves you confused in the end because the people who made this are trolls, and is fun to watch again and again.",1343174400,3,620,4.775700934579439
5878964,5,B00BJNS3VK,"I had never seen the original Japanese version of this show. I had only heard about it on funimation's website and on internet forums and blogs. I haven't been into anime for a very long amount of time, but from what other's were saying, this would be a great show for me.

After watching the entire box set, I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with this show. It was absolutely hilarious. The topics they cover are so off the wall, I had to do a double take sometimes to realize what I was actually watching. The animation is top notch and the English voice acting is perfect. I personally prefer an English dub over English subtitles, and this show didn't disappoint. The voice actors did a great job for all the characters.

Although there are only 13 episodes with bonus content, I felt it was a good purchase. I would recommend it to anyone who loves raunchy humor and doesn't mind excessive swearing. Nothing is edited, so it's all there, and let me tell you, there is a lot of it. There are even swear combinations that I haven't even heard before, and I've heard a lot. This isn't a show with a lot of fan service, but you can hear the sounds and sometimes see the shadows whenever someone's ""gettin' it on"". The traditional anime scenes throughout just make the show that much better.

And about the heaven coin everyone is talking about. I checked, and it was a limited pre-order bonus from Funimation, so none of these copies of the box set come with it. At first, I wanted one, but after seeing the show, I felt the product purchased has more merit than a silly little pre-order bonus.

To summarize: I had never seen this show before I purchased it. After watching it, I want two things. 1) To watch it through again (Yes, it's that good). 2) A second season. This show was so good and the way it ended, it deserves a second season. I've heard that it isn't happening, but I've seen it before. Take the Dead of Alive series for example. The last console title came out on the Xbox 360 in 2005. After that, the company practically fell apart and had to merge in order to survive. The game's creator even left, and he mentioned that the series was over. It's been seven long years, and even with all that turmoil (and the creator leaving), it's finally coming out in September. That just goes to show that nothing is impossible. And I used that example specifically since it's a Japanese company and some of them don't care about their US and European fan bases. Hopefully, the sales here and on other websites will show them that they have a real gem on their hands. Maybe season 2 will be out before too long.",1343174400,9,2626,4.430641821946169

Well that pretty much the gist of the plot. It's like one big dirty joke.

The anime looks like it was made in a western style cartoon. The characters aren't really likeable. There's Panty the slut who uses her panties as a gun. And Stocking the goth who uses her stockings as swords. There's also an annoying dog named Chuck. I think he's just a ripoff of Gir from Invader Zim except much, MUCH more annoying.

That, and surprisingly, the English voice acting is pretty good. In fact, the English dialogue is better if you ask me, but that's just my opinion. The box is nice too!

As for the show, I know the art style and silly name make it seem harmless, if not dumb, but a word to the wise (or an invitation to those with what I'd consider a good sense of humor) this show beats out anything you've seen on US TV in the curse, sexual material, and overall raunchy humor department.

5878970,5,B00BJNS3VK,I got an advance copy at Anime Expo. The dub is fantastic. Delightfully lude and a breath of fresh air from the same old. I love this show.,1341792000,5,139,4.0
5878971,5,B00BJNS3VK,"I received my copy 2 weeks early from rightstuf.com. They really got the right people to voice the characters. Love all the extras that came with the dvd box set including a heaven coin & 8 extra short mini episodes that were weird with a mixture of gross to say the least. The dvd art along with the nice art on each dvd case along with the extras and the awesome job the VAs did with the voices made this box set worth the $38.99 for me.

Watching the subtitled version so many times before this came out; I'm glad I can finally enjoy the episodes in english because of such excellent voice acting, which is very rare in anime.

If you're a Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt fan get this set! it's worth it!",1341273600,56,708,4.237037037037037
5878972,5,B00BJNS3VK,"Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt has been my favorite show since the subs. When funimation got to it, I knew they was going to thier best. They did great Panty and Stocking is more funny in eglish. I got it yesterday from Rightstuf and got a Heaven coin. [...]",1341014400,3,262,4.36734693877551

8599145,5,B00BJNS3VK,"I hope they make a second season of this Anime because it's fantastic! It's raunchy and over the top, but has a cohesive story line and we'll defined characters. I'd rank this among Kill la Kill and FLCL. This has very quickly become one of my favorite anise series. It's very funny and witty.",1518393600,,293,4.444444444444445

8599150,5,B00BJNS3VK,"OMG!!! This is an absolutely fun series!! Definitely not a kids cartoon/anime. I bought this on a whim and have not regretted it since. The jokes and humor are crude and the characters are sexually objectified for those whom of which care about that kind of thing, but, for the rest of, it's just freaking hilarious and fun!! Plots are outrageous. The characters even more outrageous. Freaking love it!",1514937600,,402,4.840579710144928
