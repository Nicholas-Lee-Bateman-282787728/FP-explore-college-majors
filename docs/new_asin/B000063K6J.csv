1690784,5,B000063K6J,"I think this has to be one of the best South Park DVD's avaiable to buy.  I haven't really had a chance to watch the newer ones on TV, so it helps when they put them out on DVD.  I had heard about these episodes, but had never seen them.  Now that I have, I can easily say that this is South Park at its best.
Here are brief summaries of the episodes on the disk.  (Brief, because most of the stuff I can't even write on this public site!)
""It Hits the Fan"" : Yep, the one where you hear the ""S"" word 162 times, unedited.  I can't believe they aired this one uncensored for the first time!  Very funny.  Hearing the ""S"" word gets a little annoying towards the middle of the episode, but that's the whole point.
Grade: A-
""Cripple Fight"" : New disabled kid, Jimmy, enters the scene and poses a threat to Timmy as being the new popular disabled kid.  Timmy knows he must do something right away.  It's hillarious and brutal at the same time when you see these two fight.  What will they come up with next?!
Grade: A+
""Proper Condom Use"" : Sex Ed South Park style!  That's all I can say that will make it on here.  This is a funny, but very disgusting episode.  A little much at times, but still very good and funny.
Grade: A
""Scott Tenorman Must Die"" : After a high school kid tricks Eric Cartman into buying a certian type ""hair"" from him for 10 bucks, Eric decides to get revenge.  It ends very much like ""Usual Suspects,"" meaning it's very twisted and unexpected.  I loved it!
Grade: A+
Overall very funny DVD, although there aren't any eye-popping special features, but that's okay.  It would've been nice to include maybe one of two more episodes, since these DVDs are in no way cheap and that it's only approx. 88 minutes long.  Still, a very funny South Park DVD that should be on every South Park fan's wish list.
Final thought:  TIMMY RULES!!!!!!!  (well.....he does!)",1023580800,22,1875,4.320916905444126
1690785,5,B000063K6J,"Insults to injuries is a great dvd.  It includes 4 of the Season 5 (my favorite season)episodes.  It Hits The Fan, Cripple Fight, Proper Condom Use, and Scott Tenorman must Die
It hits the fan is very funny i would give it 4/5 it also says s**t 162 times.
Cripple Fight is a really popular episode i give it 4/5 also
Proper Condom use is hilarious i give it 5/5
Scott Tenorman Must Die is one of the best episodes ever that is packed with surprises and crazy humor
If you're a south park fan than i highly recommend that you buy this.  If you get offended easily then you probably shouldnt buy this.",1023494400,2,599,4.2368421052631575
1690786,5,B000063K6J,"This is a great DVD.  I have all the south park DVD's, but this one is the best for one reason.  SCOTT TENORMAN MUST DIE!  I have been a South Park fan from the begining and there have been a lot of good episodes, but Scott Tenorman must Die is by far the best episode.  It has everything you look for in a South Park episode.  It was crude, it was nasty, and it had a cool band in it. What sets this apart from all other episodes is cartman getting back at Scott Tenorman.  In every other TV show or movie there is always a Scott Tenorman like charecter, Who realy deserves to DIE!  But nothin ever happens to them.  The good charecter in the story decides to take the high road or somethin stupid like that.  Cartman didn't do that. He got back at Scott Tenorman Great. That kid deserved what he got.  In most TV shows Scott Tenorman Wouldn't have gotton what he deserved.
South Park Isn't most TV shows.
I think i've been talking about Scott Tenorman to much,  The other episodes are also great.  It Hits the Fan broke yet another rule of television.  I don't think I can say the actual word that they used on the show, but they said [a bad word] on television almost 200 times.  It was a crazy episode, but isn't craziness why we all watch South Park in the first place.
Cripple Fight is a good episode too, I realy hate Jimmy, but I think it's funny that the people on the show think he's funny.  Jimmy is realy not funny at all.
Proper Condom use is a hilarious episode.  The best part of that episode is Mr. Garrison teaching the kids all the sexual positions.  I've never laughed more in my life.
This is a great DVD.  I recomend it to anybody.",1022889600,2,1652,4.190476190476191
1690787,5,B000063K6J,"I have been a South Park fan for years and can officially say that it has warped my fragile little mind. But, I can't say that without mentioning what fun its been. Southpark uses shock humor, and sometimes extremely Sharp wit to generate laughs. The main reason that I even review this dvd is it contains my most favorite episode in which Cartman rules the day: ""Scott Tenorman Must Die.""
This episode alone is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. When Scott Tenorman steals money (16 dollars and 12 cents) from Cheezy Poof loving Eric Cartman, he must find a way to get it back. When no one wants to help Cartman, and all seems lost, he devises an ingenius plan for ultimate revenge. Sure to get you rolling on the floor - whether your a fan or not.
Also, luckily, there is another episode included titled ""Cripple Fight"" that is funny as everything. Timmy and ""wow, what a terrific audience"" Jimmy, go head to head in the battle of the handicapped.
(Some mild material below, just for information.)<P Ok...
""Proper Use"" has Mr Mackey teaching a sex education class, and quickly has all of the kids afraid to get near the opposite sex in fear of STD's.
All 4 episodes:
""It Hits The Fan"", ""Cripple Fight"", ""Scott Tenorman Must Die"" and ""Proper Use"".",1017878400,35,1258,4.546255506607929

7959408,5,B000063K6J,"Back in the time when TV boxed sets were too expensive for the average person to buy, Trey Parker & Matt Stone produced a series of their favorite episodes on DVD and Insult To Injuries is by far the best. This DVD features ""It Hits The Fan"" which in response to them using a word too often, they say it 162 times and count it out on the screen. ""Cripple Fight"" where South Parks resident disabled kids go at it. ""Proper Condom Use"" a hysterical episode where Mr. Mackey & Mrs. Chokesondick do it! ...and ""Scott Tenerman Must Die"" which is probably the single best South Park episode ever! This disc shows 4 of the best episodes, that really pushed the envelope and showed how cable TV gives show like this much more leeway than traditional TV.",1361664000,,744,4.437956204379562
7959409,2,B000063K6J,"I love South Park, but this set is stupid. Get the season set instead, its way better than this joke.",1218153600,,101,4.1
7959410,4,B000063K6J,"These episodes are hilarious and are a prime example of how awesome south park is, but instead of buying in volumes, BUY THE SEASON.",1154476800,,132,4.541666666666667
7959411,5,B000063K6J,"Even though it would just make sense to just buy the season sets, since they're a little much(one store here has them at 51.99), it makes sense to get themed DVD's. What you get here is probably some of the weirdest and sickest humor of the show but it's just funny.

It Hits the Fan: Inspired I bet by Chicago Hope having the word, a network airs the word ""sh*t"" and soon it becomes a popular word. Only saying it is going to bring a curse and bring a demon out. Pretty funny, includes an on-screen counter for the amount of times the word's said.

Cripple Fight: Probably one of the few times you should be appalled yet you're laughing like hell. Timmy is threatened by new disabled kid Jimmy, who does standup comedy. It all comes to a head when they have an all and out brawl.

Proper Condom Use: It's sex ed time for the kids as Mr Mackey teaches the boys despite being inexperienced while Ms Choksondik teaches the girls and scares them silly about STD's. My favorite part is when Butters tries to put a condom on. His dialogue is quite funny. Personally the ""love scene"" between the 2 teachers is rather bad.

Scott Tenorman Must Die: A racist, bigot, inconsiderate, slightly masochist and self-centered Cartman vows revenge on a 9th grader who sold him hair from a certain body part. Cartman's eventual revenge is quite out there and twisted yet for some reason you don't hate him. One of his traits. Radiohead guest-stars.

My only complaint with the otherwise excellent disc is that there's no chapter selection for the episodes. The Scott Tenorman episode doesn't really kick until later, where you suffer a rather bland first half but if you can't afford the season sets, get this instead.",1118188800,,1701,4.600660066006601
7959412,5,B000063K6J,"If you're really desparate for some recent ""South Park"" episodes and just can't wait for (or afford) the Season 5 DVD's, this little disc should satisfy your appetite for some of Trey and Matt's uniquely sick and twisted humor.  Indeed, for a comparatively low price you can get four of the show's best episodes, filled with the kind of moments that you just can't find enough of on basic cable.  By 2001, Trey and Matt could get away with just about anything they wanted, and it shows here, as these four episodes are all so outrageously offensive they could give the entire membership of the Moral Majority fatal heart attacks.  Here's a quick review for those with short attention spans: in just 90 or so minutes, you get child molestation, a fight between wheelchair-bound Timmy and his crutch-laden rival Jimmy, a fourth grader manually stimulating a dog, kindergarteners learning the Filthy Sanchez, 162 uncut uses of a certain four-letter word that starts with ""s"" and ends with ""t"", and an entire episode revolving around pubic hair.  Of course, it's not all shock and awe, as there's plenty of Trey and Matt's patented razor-sharp social satire on display.  ""Cripple Fight"" presents a surprisingly thoughtful take on the recent controversy over homosexuality in the Boy Scouts; ""Proper Condom Use"" is a spot-on sendup of sex-ed hysteria; and ""It Hits The Fan"" gives us the delicious irony of an episode that satirizes TV's declining standards while the characters swear up a storm at the same time.  ""South Park"" has been somewhat inconsistent over the past few years, but as one the show's most ardent fans I offer my assurances that the four episodes here are pure quality.  If only there were some more appearances by Tweek here, we'd be looking at TV perfection.",1099094400,3,1775,4.8966666666666665

There not on DVD so thats why I saw this. I can't wait for the 6th season with these episodes. But these episodes are still great but don't really buy it unless your really dyig to see these episodes. These are the episodes and their description.
episode 1- it hits the fans- nypd says the word sh&* and the towns mind gets possesed.
episode 2- criplled fight- timmy and jimmy duke it out
episode 3- proper condem use- Mr maky and Ms Choksondik endore sexual content
episode 4- Scott Tenorman must die- Cartman gets ripped off 16 dollars with special appearance ""Radio head""",1087862400,,716,4.6015625
7959415,4,B000063K6J,"South Park - Insults to Injuries is definitely the video to own for die-hard fans, and new fans alike.  It has some of the best episodes, that are chock full of the political commentary, and is sure to keep you doubled over in laughter.
This video contains the infamous ""'It' Hits The Fan"", where ""IT"" is said 163 times.  But don't think this is just about being a potty mouth.  It's about the overcommercialization of the worst parts of our pop culture and how the need for ratings reaps horrible consequences.
Insults to Injuries is not a video you want to rent.  You'll want to see ""IT"" over and over.  And each time, you'll laugh just a little harder while you learn.  Highly recommended.",1061424000,,692,4.540322580645161
