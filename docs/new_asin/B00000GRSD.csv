7909082,3,B00000GRSD,i don't know if i remember this but i think these were some episodes of when like tommy was the evil green ranger,1489017600,,113,3.9565217391304346
7909083,5,B00000GRSD,"At the beginning the Rangers had finally learned that Tommy was Green Ranger.  The shock was overwhelming.  Once they accepted it, they quickly realized the truth - that Rita must be controlling Tommy's mind.  That realization gave them knew purpose - they had to break Rita's spell and save Tommy.

Rita however was certain of her impending victory.  She called forth the Mighty Dragon Zord.  Under Green Rangers control, it was meant to be end of the Power Rangers.  Without Zords the Rangers came to face him, but the there was a difference.  Them knowing who he was made a difference.  Somehow the real Tommy was fighting the spell somewhat, but he still had no choice but to attack.

They would have been destroyed, but then Alpha manage to re-establish Zordon.  His strength returned the Zords to the Rangers, and he told Jason to destroy the Sword of Darkness.  In the following battle the audience gets T-Rex Zord vs Dragon Zord and then Megazord vs Dragon Zord.

The final battle was Green Ranger vs Red Ranger -  Sword to Sword.  The Dragon Dagger's Power energized Green Ranger's chest plate, turning it into a Mystical Shield - that reflected Jason's blasts back at him.  Then a major blast from the Sword of Darkness sent Jason flying.  Then Jason disarmed Tommy, and vaporized the Sword of Darkness with a Beam from his Blade Blaster.

Afterwards Jason demonstrated the wisdom that let him lead the others.  Everything Tommy had done was because of Rita's spell, not his fault.  He wanted Tommy to help them defeat Rita.  Without hesitation all 5 Rangers asked Tommy to fight by their side.

Tommy joining them gave them another Ranger.  With him came Dragon Zord in fighting mode, Mega Dragon Zord, and eventually Utra Zord.",1453507200,,1739,4.781144781144781
7909084,1,B00000GRSD,"I saw this only once.  It was on a tape with two other Christmas episodes ""I'm Dreaming of a White Ranger"" (Mighty Morphin season 3), and ""A Season to Remember"" (Zeo).  It was the last episode on the tape so you can watch the first two and not have to sit through (or fast forward past) this confusing, garbled annoyance.  They knew it was bad.",1390348800,,344,4.2615384615384615
7909085,1,B00000GRSD,"Let me start by saying the following: I grew up with the Rangers, they were awesome. My parents had me an wayne watch the tape one christmas, and then put it away.

For a power rangers christmas special, I would point fans to ""I'm dreaming of a White Ranger"" before this thing. Here's what's on the tape. An ad for Power Rangers merchandise that you can't get anymore unless you dig around the internet. A cool promo for a karate school taught by the Green Ranger, Tommy. Then the movie starts. The rangers are no where to be seen because they're with santa doing very important work. Alpha and Zordon are all alone. Then Zordon presents Alpha with a christmas tree to get into christmas... Zordon's mouth STILL does not synch up with his words.

Then Alpha gets an idea to make the place more ""christmassy"" so that santa will come and the rangers will come with them. So he invites kids without getting their parents permission (some might call this kidnapping) to decorate the place and sing christmas carols. Then the green ranger, pink ranger, and blue ranger show up and the end the special singing ""we wish you a merry christmas"" and a montage.

All of this happens in a span of 30 minutes. The recordings of the actual carols are definitely third rate compared to other versions of Christmas carols for kids. Basically that's what this tape is, a tape of christmas carols with very little power rangers. It's pretty bad, but a 5 year old kid or younger might like it. However, if you don't want your ear drums to suffer, I point you in the directions of another tape of christmas carols for kids: Kid Songs We wish you a merry Christmas.",1266796800,,1644,4.5286195286195285

7909089,5,B00000GRSD,"This episode is the last of the Evil Green Ranger episodes.  The Power Rangers at the end get Tommy to his original self and becomes one of the good guys, then they go and get Rita, but she always seems to disappear whenever she gets in danger (she's a chicken).  Trust me if you are looking for action this is the video to get for anyone in your family, but if you are getting this video make sure you have seen the other four episodes that go along with this video.  They are here in Amazon.com, just have to search for them.  If you are embarassed to buy it because you are to old, hey, I am 15 years old and my mom loves them and she is 41 years old.  The Original Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers Rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So buy it!!!!!!!!!!!",995155200,10,738,4.198581560283688
