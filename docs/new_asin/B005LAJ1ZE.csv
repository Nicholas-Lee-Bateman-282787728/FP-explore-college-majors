4824670,5,B005LAJ1ZE,"""Suburgatory"" is a new (2011-2012) ABC television comedy series, starring Jane Levy as Tessa Altman, cool and savvy New York City high school student, summarily transplanted to the suburbs by her architect father George (Jeremy Sisto) after he discovers a box of condoms in her room.  Tessa finds herself hilariously out of step with her new classmates, and must scramble to find her own niche.  Some of the best comedy of the show comes from Tessa's sarcastic voice-over commentary on her new life.

The storylines typically proceed on two tracks, with Tessa finding new ways to prod and poke her overbearing classmates, and sometimes just being a typical teenager.  Her single (and eligible) father must also navigate a new environment of stuffy country clubs, militant PTA's, and pushy neighborhood watch organizations.  He is guided by old college friend and dentist Noah Werner (Alan Tudyk), who attempts to interpret the new rules for George.  George also gets some help from good-hearted but over-the-top female neighbor Dallas Royce (Cheryl Hines), who goes out of her way to help Tessa adjust; she may also have an agenda planned for George as well.  Alicia Silverstone makes a late-season appearence as a surrogate mother for Noah and his wife, and a possible love interest for George (and, of course, an inside joke for those who saw the movie ""Clueless"").  The interaction between Tessa and George is sometimes the best part of the show, as they take turns being the adult in their rather unique father-daughter relationship.

The comedy is consistently good, and the show is willing to pursue its humor over, around, and through any number of stereotypes associated with American suburbia.  ""Suburgatory"" has already been renewed for a second season, and is highly recommended to fans of its distinctive brand of humor.",1335571200,17,1832,5.117449664429531

4824677,1,B005LAJ1ZE,"My wife and I have tried to watch this and like it, since it is sandwiched between the Middle and Modern Family.

It is like an ABC exec said ""I know, let's come up with a sitcom about a teenage girl growing up in the suburbs... Does anyone know somebody who lives in a suburb?... anyone?""

Apparently not.

The plots are contrived, and the format is old and tired, pretending to be cutting edge. And the characters are  like The Stepford Wives meet Desperate Housewives, but not nearly as interesting as either. Cheryl Hines was marvelous in Curb Your Enthusiasm. Halfway into this show, she inexplicably turned into another Stepford Wife. All the adults in this show are only canon fodder for the smart-mouth comments of a spoiled brat teenager, none of which are funny.

Whoever cancelled Better Off Ted and created this should be fired. Some 40-something writers think they have their finger on the pulse of the 10 to 18-year-old female market sector... ""Does anyone know a 10 to 18-year-old female?... anyone?""

4824803,2,B005LAJ1ZE,"I rented the first disc of Suburgatory and saw the first several episodes before I went on Amazon to purchase the first season.  I thought I had discovered a great new sitcom with fantastic characters that made me laugh out loud so I was hoping it would be consistently funny throughout.

In the first episode you are introduced to many quirky, funny characters that were absolutely hilarious. This included the really hot, ditzy neighbor and her monotone, morose daughter, a father who moved to suburbia with his city slicker daughter and two neighbors with hot wives who could not possibly have been straight.  Those two characters made a couple of guest appearances in future episodes but never were really developed as characters.  The ditzy neighbor was a decent character but she was not nearly as funny in future episodes. The daughter was pretty consistent throughout but her father just became the town romeo with every woman under the sun wanting to sleep with him. I have seen this so many times in television shows and it always means that the character is going to be just there for romantic plot lines. Yuck.

Anyway, this show is okay. It is not nearly as good as I thought it would be and I have read about it online and found that it has been waffling between existing and being cancelled. I wish that the first episode was a mirror into the future of this show because it was so promising but it degraded into just the average sitcom with a few laughs here and there. The father is now a trophy man in the neighborhood, the laughs are fewer and further between with the ditzy neighbor (although she is smoking hot) and her morose daughter and the main character has not evolved enough for my taste.  Rent this one if you can and see if you like more than the first couple of episodes. If you do, buy it.  I am guessing that many of you will say, ""Not bad, but....""",1393200000,2,1882,4.533923303834809

4824806,4,B005LAJ1ZE,"I started watching this show because Alan Tudyk talked about wearing a speedo in it.

4824850,5,B005LAJ1ZE,"I had no idea this show even existed until Jane Levy was cast in the update of the ""Evil Dead"" movie. Out of curiosity as to who Jane Levy was, I rented disk 1 of season 1 and immediately fell in love with it for reasons I probably can't list, but I'm gonna try.

I don't think I'm the typical target audience for a show like ""Suburgatory"", but maybe I am; who knows? I didn't think I was the target audience for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" either before I got hooked on that show and realized that the target audience was not teenage girls, but EVERYBODY. The same goes for ""Suburgatory"". You would assume that the target audience is teenage girls, but you would be sadly mistaken. The target audience is anybody with a heart and/or a sense of humor.

The show is about a single father, George Altman, who moves he and his daughter, Tessa Altman, from the inner city to a suburb, against the daughters will. Tessa is a product of the city and much about her life is confusing, fast and overwhelming. She doesn't know her mother and she is trying to find a place to fit in with a rebellious outer-shell and a vulnerable inner-shell.

The show is gifted with solid writing and creative comedy, but most importantly Jane Levy sells the character of Tessa and you can't help but feel invested in every conflicting situation she encounters. She's adorable, twisted, tougher than she appears, more vulnerable than she appears, confused and dealing with life as it comes; something we can all relate to.

Bottom line, it's a funny quirky show with real emotions and real dilemma's camouflaged by an overall giddiness. Not being a big fan of formula shows, ""Suburgatory"" is right up my alley because in the course of watching the episodes, you come to know Tessa and George and you come to love them and wish they were your friends or neighbors and you want to keep coming back. Not many shows have that power, but ""Suburgatory"" does.",1375228800,4,1926,4.573913043478261

This show is the story of George and Tessa Altman, a father/daughter duo who move to the suburbs from New York City. George found condoms in teenage Tessa's room and quickly moved her to the burbs where everything is perfect and she'll be safe. And while the town they live in is freakishly perfect in many ways, it also has its share of problems which Tessa and George work through together and the help of their various friends.

This isn't the perfect show by any means, but it's cute and it works. Jane Levy plays the New York City teenager who was forced to move to the burbs, quite well. She quickly becomes friends with Malik, the high schools so-called token black kid who happens to be dating Tessa's best friend Lisa, who lives across the street from Tessa. I relate to Tessa a lot. She's awkward, she's a teenager who's convinced her parents don't understand her (although hers don't for various reasons. Mostly because they're weird).

Tessa of course has a rival, this is high school, and TV. Her rival is Dalia, a materialistic popular girl, who has her smart moments, but often has things go over her head to the annoyance of everyone around her. Dalia's mother, Dallas,  is really good friends with George and often throws signals at George that she would like more. He is currently ignoring most of them.

I didn't expect to fall in love with this show. I assumed I'd get it from the library (thanks local library for having massive amounts of TV shows), put it in and have it as background noise while I complete everything on my to-do list. Yet that didn't happen at all. I got sucked in. Hard. I want more of it and I want more of it now. I like the friendship between Lisa and Tessa. I like the father/daughter relationship between George and Tessa because even if it isn't a `normal' relationship, it's theirs and it works. I like that they portray relationships well between Tessa and guys, too. There was a brief love interest in the first season and one that you don't know is there, but it's perfect.

I put this show in the area I put Raising Hope. I wish it got more attention because it's a good TV show.",1357084800,,2170,4.481012658227848

They have assembled such a great cast of characters, and most are all really funny and unique in their own way. They use elements of satire and parody in this show, but it's not meant to be taken too seriously or as an accurate portrayal of the suburbs, that's why it's well done. They play with the stereotypes while at the same time subverting the expectations of these stereotypes. The main character, Tessa, is perfectly played by Jane Levy. I don't think they could have chosen anyone better. And I find myself laughing throughout most episodes. Once the show found it's voice, you could really tell, and it just got better. The only down side of season 1 is a guest star they have at the end of the season but I am happy to find out that guest star will not be returning for Season 2.

4824943,4,B005LAJ1ZE,"Suburgatory is one of those rare gems, a show where everything seems somehow to have gelled, perfectly, effortlessly, remarkably, into a funny, quirky, unique and brilliantly written romp. And yet, it is also just like every other show on television right now: suffering under the boot of the network overlords and their demands for changes to ""make it better"". The focus is an old story made new again: two fish out of water, in this case a father and daughter duo from the tough, modern streets of New York, uprooted and living a new life in the 'burbs, surrounded by an array of ever-present colorful characters who always have something interesting to say or something odd to do so that we, as the viewers, can witness through the eyes of that father and daughter, this bounty of crazy, wacky fun and immerse ourselves vicariously in this new culture.

Unfortunately, at a certain point the focus on all the charm and strangeness and meeting of the minds for a better understanding, etc., was replaced by the standard ""let's tell a story about a single dad trying to get laid"" and everything pretty much fell apart. The father dating was not the issue, in fact that is a story that would have worked quite well, had it not taken over the entire show, essentially kicking every other plotline out of the room so that ABC execs could place all of their so-called eggs in the basket that is Alicia Silverstone who became the random and terrible love interest, previously mentioned. Now, I like Alicia Silverstone. I like her as an actress and I respect her as a human being. That being said, the character she is playing on this show is about as grating as any I have seen. Jeremy Sisto may as well be dating Fred Willard for all the good Silverstone's character, Eden, is doing on the program.

This show, as envisioned originally, was about a young girl moving to a new town, bucking authority while trying to maintain a close relationship with her father and closest friend, learning about herself by learning about others, helping, almost accidentally, her new friends to find themselves and their own version of teenage rebellion in a society where rebellion might take the form of refusing to wear an oddball outfit to a family gathering or not sending a thank you note. It was about a man who went to college and did all the right things and ended up in a job he's actually really good at and actually enjoys but the pay is, well, crap, and he's never really figured out how to have an adult relationship since his daughter's absentee mother left him (an absentee mother who really never needs to be mentioned or seen because her plotline is resolved before we ever meet this father daughter team but who is mentioned and mentioned again and yet again in another sloppy ABC attempt to try to dramatize a comedy) and so, now, he is living in a suburb where women say things they actually mean and treat him like a human being and he's finding himself finally looking for the secretly held desire: a woman he could introduce to his daughter (a woman he's already met, no spoilers here, just watch the show) and a life he never knew he wanted, one populated by nutballs who have gambling addictions (not the serious kind, the funny kind) and their own secret desires (like opening up a cut crystal paper-weight store or being the best of all the Martha Stewart clones).

It was the people that made the first half of this season magnificent and absolutely worth a watch. What it became was a regression into a standardized mold, a story about a man falling uncomfortably in love with a surrogate, who is pregnant with his best friend's child, while discovering his daughter's secret desire for a mother he never knew she wanted and it was this soap opera silliness (the kind that doesn't make you laugh) that ruined it. Here's hoping they get the magic back for season two of this truly outstanding concept comedy. That being said, there was one episode from the later half of the season that measured up to that old standard of magnificent oddity and laugh-until-you-cry  excellence comedy addicts will appreciate: Down Time. Now that's a keeper.",1344038400,4,4152,4.683561643835616

My most Favorite eposide of this new sitcom is the Thanksgiving eposide last year. It was SOO funny to me that i watched it 4,or 5 more times after ward on the you-tube. I liked the part about Lisa Shay refusing to wear that 16th. century dress for the family get together,and her showing up in front of the family & guest (Buck naked) then running out of the house for a little 1974 streaking time,and the pilgram,and Indian outfits everyone was wearing,and the bickering at the table for the toasting time Lisa's bossy mother telling her husband to wrap it up,when only a couple of words had just came out,and of course Spoilt Rotten Daliya. this one eposide will be what makes me shell out the funds for the up coming release of season #1. sincerly glad that it made it,and not cut at the 1st. season like what happens to soo many new shows..tony.",1341446400,2,1015,4.481081081081081

I'm actually not a big fan of television sit-coms.  I find most of them to be too ridiculous and perfunctory.  However, Suburgatory is a hilarious send-up of modern day suburbia.  I especially appreciate the depiction of the suburban mothers who are ruthlessly competitive and fighting hard to be the best of the suburban moms.  Though satirical, it really is an accurate portrayal of the cut-throat motherhood culture of today.

Admittedly, this show is at times over the top, but it really makes me laugh.  And laughter really is good for the soul!",1341360000,,665,4.883928571428571

4824947,3,B005LAJ1ZE,"I am never going to get ""rich"" following a K-Harris review.  However, I thought I would chime in anyway =:)

I generally have no tolerance for 30-minute programs either in real time or on-demand, as with 8-minutes (30%) of commercials there is too much fast forward for what amounts to 22-minutes of programming time.  The solution for moi has been to wait for the season to end and then purchase the season series where I can watch blocks of episodes interrupted only by the changing of the discs.

I starting watching Suburgatory during the mid season semester break (AKA TV dead zone).  There were few options and my on-demand had all episodes broadcast to date.  I found the show to be a witty enough comedy with wise cracking Levy as an appealing character in the land of ""plastic"" that is Suburgatory.

Advance apologies for my being overly familiar, though I tend to refer to actors either by prior roles or last names.  Suburgatory has an excellent cast around Levy.  I really like Alpha from ""The Dollhouse"" taking a stab at comedy, as Sisto's (Levy's dad) best friend.  Hines (Dallas) is M..F personified and being a betting man, I would give even money on a future hook-up with Sisto.  Lloyd from ""Entourage"" (coming dangerously close to being type cast - if he cares) is very good as the school Principal and perhaps my favorite character is ""dead pan"" Dahlia (Hine's daughter), as Levy's nemesis.  Not sure how I feel about Sisto in a comedy role?

I subtracted a 1/2-star for the introduction of Silverstone as a surrogate and girlfriend to Sisto.  I actually found the storyline to be mildly annoying!  Amazing that when ""Clueless"" came out that AS was considered to be the savior of Sony Studios.  She has fallen so far out of the ""A-List"" to be placed as an additional character on a moderately successful comedy sitcom.

Suburgatory is one of those programs where while watching is entertaining, though I tend not to think too much about it after and would not morn if it went away.",1339545600,3,2000,4.7011494252873565
