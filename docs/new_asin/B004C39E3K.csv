4324389,4,B004C39E3K,"Pat Tillman, a professional NFL football player who played for the Arizona Cardinals, a football player who was dominating in high school and also at Arizona State University.  A loving son who cared about his family, a husband who cared about his wife Marie but most of all, he was a man who was inspired by his extensive family line who were members of the military and fought for their country.

But the day after 9/11, Pat and his brother Kevin and Pat all decided that they wanted to do something for their country and all three enlisted for the military.  Pat Tillman would give up on his professional NFL career, forgo the millions of dollars he was making as an athlete to become part of the US Army Rangers.

America was captivated by Pat Tillman quitting the NFL to become a Ranger but on April 22, 2004, the Tillman family received the worst news possible.  Their son was killed during an ambush while trying to protect soldiers who were being attacked by the Taliban and Tillman risked his life to save many of his fellow soldiers.

Pat Tillman received a huge, televised memorial and family, friends and may came to show their support and honor for Pat Tillman.  But the Tillman's knew something was wrong when his Pat's good friend, Russel Baer would not give details of what happened to Pat.  The US military gave him special instructions of what he had to do when he went back home with his brother Kevin (who was also in the area when Pat died) along with Pat's body when they returned back to Arizona.

For most American families who have lost a love one in Iraq or Afghanistan or any other country, the reason of what the US military tells you, no one expects the military to lie about it.  And most families take their word and move on...

But the Tillman family was not that kind of family.  They wanted to know details.

A special investigation was conducted and five weeks after the initial announce of Pat Tillman's death, Brigadier General Gary M. Jones and the U.S. Department of Defense concluded that Pat Tillman (and soldiers of the Afghan militia) were killed due to friendly fire aggravated by the intensity of the firefight.  The military supplied the family with binders of 3000-pages of information from the investigation, expecting the family to not dig into the information.

But not the Tillman family.  The family sought help from former Ranger Stan Goff who owned a blog site called FeralScholar.com and together, they pieced together the many blackened areas of each page (trying to link names of soldiers and higher-ups) and sure enough, what they read in the binder was shocking.

Was Pat Tillman killed by soldiers who didn't follow the rules, were gun happy and just wanted to engage in combat?  Why was his clothes burned, his protective vest destroyed?

So, many questions that people who were following the story of Pat Tillman and were confused because the government kept changing its tune of how he Pat Tillman died.  Was this another person that was used for propaganda like Jessica Lynch?  The soldier who was rescued in Iraq and news reported that she was a female Rambo that tried to save her own soldiers but Lynch came out to say all the stories were untrue.  Her weapon jammed, she was shot and she was captured.  But instead, the US military used her story as propaganda.

The interesting thing was that Pat Tillman was there and was about to rescue her but instead of having the soldiers go and save her, instead the US military delayed it until they could get a camera crew to film the whole ordeal?

Needless to say, Pat Tillman was getting frustrated of what he was seeing overseas.  Things that the military were doing wrong.

Amir Bar-Lev's documentary ""The Tillman Story"" retraces Pat Tillman from the beginning.  As a child, as a man who didn't believe in God but still respected others who believed in religion, how he was a modest man and never liked taking credit and would rather give credit to his coaches or his team, a man who he and his brothers at a young age loved cussing up a storm.  But still, this was a man who loved his family, his wife and wanted to serve in the military.

Bar-Lev shows us how the Tillman Story started to unravel.  Interviews with family members but also members of those who were with Pat Tillman when they were attacked and those who were on the other side.

The documentary answers questions by retracing of what happened to that day and thankfully by the confessions by Russel Baer and Spc. Bryan O'Neal, we had a chance to understand how Pat Tillman died and the degree of negligence and deceit that came from the US military.

We learn about soldiers close to Pat who were ordered not to reveal anything about his death.  We learn that even Tillman himself suspected that if he died, the US government would use him as propaganda, even smuggling out to his wife, clear instructions of how he was to be buried and not be buried at the Arlington.  Especially when it came to details of why he enlisted, he wanted it private yet the reason why he enlisted was broadcast on the big screens during a football game to honor Pat Tillman.

The documentary takes us to where the Tillman family had a chance to face congress and to see if the generals would acknowledge that they knew the truth about Tillman's death prior to his memorial (a P4 memo was leaked to the Associated Press showing that the military brass and possibly up to the president may have known the truth that Tillman died of friendly fire and yet still gave a different story to America and for his televised memorial).

Amir Bar-Lev's shocking, infuriating documentary on the US military's cover-up of Pat Tillman's death is no holds barred and goes deeper to expose the arrogance, negligence and deceit that the US government and US military did to hide the truth behind Pat Tillman's death.

VIDEO:

""The Tillman Story"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The documentary is presented in High Definition and while the more recent footage looks great, it's important for people to know that we get classic video footage of Tillman growing up through the years, older photography, so you're going to get that mixed quality of picture quality as would be expected from a documentary.  But overall, the picture quality is very good for this Blu-ray release.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Tillman Story"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  While there is a lossless soundtrack, this is not a action or adventure film.  This is a documentary.  Spoken dialogue is crystal clear and again, because it uses sources from the past chronicling Tillman's life, you're going to get mix sources of audio quality.  But for the most part, the audio is understandable and very clear.

Subtitles are presented in English and English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Tillman Story"" comes with a director's commentary by Amir Bar-Lev who talks about various scenes, what his goal was to achieve with the footage, commenting on the various comments by the family and the things he learned during the course of working on the documentary.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Prior to watching ""The Tillman Story"", like many people who watched the news,  I was confused by everything that happened.  Various interpretations of his death, family upset of a cover-up and coming from the heels of Jessica Lynch exposing the truth about her capture and rescue, I figured that the US military (as with other military in the world and every war that has happened in American history) had to spin the stories of Lynch and Tillman's death as a morale booster for those who were growing weary about the war in the Middle East.

The fact as shown in many public pools, there are many American soldiers who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq and public opinion towards America's occupation of the Middle East has waned.  It has been hot topic in the news and politics and media-wise, it has a been a battle between the US government and the American media of public support.  The government, especially the US military needed to show the importance of the occupation while showing us back home, of the heroes of the war.  And unfortunately, many names have been shown but are quickly replaced every week as more and more names of soldier's deaths are announced in the news.

But for Pat Tillman, because of he was a former NFL football player and the news surrounding him quitting the NFL and his lucrative career became media fodder.

In the case of Jessica Lynch, the story that was given to us by the US military was quite heroic and something you would expect from a movie because they painted her as a female Rambo trying to fight her enemies with every last breath that she had before she was captured.  And sure enough, the true story when it came out (courtesy of Jessica Lynch) was less than glamorous and we learned how US propaganda reared its ugly head in deceiving the American public.

But part of the problem lies in the fact that when people are called heroes and given a heroes welcome, they don't fight it.  They accept the the medals, the fame, the prestige of becoming an America hero.  No one would fight that.  But not these days.  People don't want to live a lie and in the case of Jessica Lynch, she didn't want to be painted as something she was not.

And for the Tillman family, during the memorial of his Pat Tillman, when his younger brother Richard Tillman came onstage and in front of military brass and well-known politicians, Richard said in the televised funeral, ""I didn't write (EXPLETIVE DELETED) because I'm not a writer. And I just want to say it was -- there's a lot of people here. Thanks. It was really amazing to be his little baby brother. Yeah, I'm not just gonna sit up here and break down on you, but thank you for coming. Pat was (EXPLETIVE DELETED) champion and always will be.  Just make no mistake, he would want me to say this. He is not with God, he is (EXPLETIVE DELETED). He is not religious. So thanks for your thoughts, but he's (EXPLETIVE DELETED) dead.""

Of course, the public were shocked by Richard's comments about his brother at the memorial but the truth, no one knew how Pat Tillman was as a man.  What kind of family bond he and his brothers had.  And as Pat would lay the F-bomb various times through his speech at the memorial, Pat Tillman wouldn't be surprised because he also cussed a lot since he and his brothers were young children.

And this is the portrait that we get from ""The Tillman Story"".  We get to hear from family of how Pat Tillman was.  He may have cussed up a storm but the fact was, he was cool brother, he was cool son, great husband, awesome football player and the man had an amazing heart.  And that this man, is dead.  Why is he dead?

As viewers, ""The Tillman Story"" helps us learn what the Tillman's learned overtime.  What the military told them, the true story, the deceit and why the family are still pursuing the truth today.

Pat Tillman, he was modest as a star high school football player and even as a professional NFL football player, his character was not about a man who wanted attention.  And as most families would accept the news of the death of a family member serving overseas, the Tillman family were not the family who would sit back and take everything that was given to them.  They wanted details of how he actually died, wanted to see reports that they were promised and sure enough, what they learned was that he died from friendly fire.  He was killed by his fellow Rangers.  Those who were with Pat during the friendly fire, were told to keep quiet or there would be ramifications.

Part of the problem and this is unfortunate thing for the Tillman family is that no one knows how their son was really killed.  Tillman and others tried to tell their fellow Rangers tried to communicate but unfortunately even within 40 years, for some unknown reason, their fellow Rangers shot at them.

After ""The Tillman Story"" was released, The Tillmans, Russell Baer and Staff Sgt. Bryan O'Neil were interviewed by Larry King and Baer's comment is probably the best answer that I have heard.  Baer told King, ""I really do believe that there is a serious lack of control. A lot of the guys that were shooting at us were young Rangers and it was their first -"".

Baer continued, ""Not just scared, but lack of control, meaning there were people above them on the ground that were in charge of controlling their fires. And I think there was a grave lack of control.""

What we don't see in the documentary are the people responsible for shooting at Tillman and the other soldiers.  In the director's commentary, Amir Bar-Lev said he didn't want to use their names, as they can easily be found on the Internet.

After watching ""The Tillman Story"", I thought about the film and its context.  Who is to blame?  Did the US military do the right thing by hiding the truth?  Will the Tillman family ever get the answers that they want? Was it friendly fire?  Was the soldiers trying to kill Pat Tillman in purpose?  Why were those who were with Pat on the day he died, warned about them speaking to the public.  Why were people demoted?

I'm sure there are a lot of conspiracy theories, I'm sure this furthers the divide of people when it comes to US war propaganda and leaves a taste of disgust in their mouth.  I have had the chance to read dozens of comments, good and bad, in regards to how people have viewed the Tillman debacle.  Those who support the military and feel that propaganda to make heroes for the sake of boosting morale has been around for a long time and is needed.  Others who feel that families deserve the truth of how their loved one have died and not use the deceased in that way.

Personally, I can read and read and both side have valid opinions.  But the fact is, we not the Tillman's.  We didn't have to live this debacle that they had to live with and be lied to.

""The Tillman Story"" is a magnificent documentary.  I found it to be truly shocking, eye-opening and the amount of footage was well-edited and the overall structure was well-done.  Josh Brolin did a magnificent job as a narrator.  Director Bar-Lev achieves success in crafting a film, building it, examining the facts and then one by one, we are unloaded by the facts that the family had learned and we are literally sympathetic to the family because of the lies they have been fed.  They want to know the truth, but unfortunately... with all the facts buried, destroyed and the US military has moved on, unfortunately the Tillman family will be left with this feeling of uncertainty.

Blu-ray or DVD, I do feel that ""The Tillman Story"" is one documentary everyone familiar and interested in the Pat Tillman story should watch.

In the end, people may have not truly grasped the true nature of who Pat Tillman was through all this media coverage.  But ""The Tillman Story"" respectfully gives the Tillman family and those who knew him the final word to show us what kind of man he truly was.

""The Tillman Story"" is highly recommended!",1296691200,4,15048,4.608711978971085

Watch it, be moved and outraged that it hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.

Bravo to the family for taking back control of their own. If it were my son, I can only hope that I would pursue it to the ends of the earth as the Tillman family has.",1296604800,4,454,4.089887640449438
4324391,5,B004C39E3K,"This fascinating documentary depicts Pat Tillman as a successful, likable, down to earth freethinker who gave up his success in the NFL to join the US military. Whatever motivated him to enlist was quickly shattered when he got to Iraq. As he witnessed bombs destroy an Iraqi city he declared the war an illegal one. The US military hailed his enlistment & subsequent death in heroic detail, undoubtedly encouraging many young men to enlist.

This documentary is excellent because it shatters the romanticism of war with a real story of an honorable man & family who were manipulated to promote war propaganda. You can't help but empathize with the Tillman family for their loss & betrayal. The military's upper ranks messed with a strong mother & the wrong family. The Tillman family did as much as they could to hold whoever ordered the cover up accountable, and alas, no real punishment was handed out. It shows the raw reality of war & unaccountability of the military's top brass. All they had to do was ""not recall"" when they received a top secret memo. Convenient defense! Watch this movie then talk about it & show it to your friends. It's an important story that begs discussion & illumination. Rest in peace Pat Tillman.",1296259200,23,1230,4.80188679245283
4324392,5,B004C39E3K,"Amir Bar-Lev's film ""The Tillman Story"" contributes to the restoration of Pat Tillman's legacy by honoring the man, not the myth.  The iconoclast, not the icon.  As his mother said, ""Pat would have wanted to be remembered as an individual, not as a stock figure or political prop.  Pat was a real hero, not what they used him as.""

Amir Bar-Lev, the film's director, tells three stories that interweave together throughout his film: a biography of Pat Tillman (growing up, playing in the NFL, joining the Army Rangers with his brother Kevin after 9/11), how he was killed in Afghanistan in 2004 and his friendly-fire death covered up by the Army, and his family's battle to learn the truth after smokescreens were thrown in their face by the highest levels of the Army and  government (both Republicans and Democrats).

""The Tillman Story"" is an apt title.  The film follows the outline of Mary Tillman's memoir ""Boots on the Ground by Dusk,"" many of the interviews are with members of the Tillman family (mother, father, brother, and wife) and the film is centered around their experiences in the aftermath of Pat Tillman's death.  The Tillman's are a loyal, close-knit family that displays  much more honor and integrity than their country's leadership.

The film uses nicely selected & edited news clips and interviews that portray an iconoclastic Pat Tillman not widely known to the public - a fiercely independent thinker, an avid reader, and critic of the Iraq war (""...this war is so ----ing illegal"").  Pat was a remarkable man who was driven by a core of honesty and integrity, led by personal example, and lived his life intensely.

See the film.  Nearly everything most people think they know about Pat Tillman, his family, and the story is wrong.  And the film has more humor and laughs than you would expect, especially if you don't mind a few f-bombs; the original title of the film was ""I'm Pat ----ing Tillman!"" which fits better in some respects:  those were Pat Tillman's last words, the Tillman family drops F-bombs where appropriate (or not) and it suggests that Pat Tillman was more complex than his iconic image.  The beginning and end of the film, with Pat just looking at the camera was especially poignant for me.

In 2005, I was angered that the truth about Pat's life and death had been buried by the media and government.  Tillman was enshrined as an icon while the man fell by the wayside, his family used as props at his funeral for war propaganda.  Pat's family still don't have the meager consolation of knowing the full truth about his death.  ""The truth may be painful, but it's the truth,"" his mother said.  ""If you feel you're being lied to, you can never put it to rest.""

I hope the Oscar judges are also moved by ""The Tillman Story"".  It would be great if the film was awarded Best Documentary (or at least placed in the final five on 1/25/11).  Except for ""Restrepo"", I haven't yet seen the other Oscar contenders.  Perhaps ""The Tillman Story"" is not technically the ""best"" documentary of the bunch, but I believe it tells the best, most compelling story.

""The Tillman Story"" documentary is a good introduction to the Pat Tillman story.  However, the director Amir Bar-Lev tried to cover a lot of ground in only 94 minutes (he cut the film down from 2 1/2 hours).  At times the film rushes through the material passing over the details (especially concerning the cover-up of Tillman's friendly-fire death.

To fill in the details,  I'd suggest starting with Gary Smith's profile ""Remember His Name"" (si.com 9-11-06), Mike Fish's ""An Un-American Tragedy"" series (2006 espn.com), and the most  recent profile by Mick Brown ""Betrayal of an All-American Hero"" (The Telegraph 10-07-10).

For books, I'd suggest Mary Tillman's memoir ""Boots on the Ground by Dusk"" (blurb website has a preview) which the film was largely based upon, or Jon Krakauer's ""Where Men Win Glory"" (revised paperback has more on Army cover-up).  But, although Krakuaer has the best account of the actual friendly-fire incident and the Army's cover-up, his book is a flawed work since Krakauer lost the trust and cooperation of the Tillman family (except for Marie) and  failed to describe how President Obama and the  Democratic Congress continued the Bush administration & Army cover-up.

For blogs, try John T. Reed's Tillman posts (see his ""military articles"" at johntreed website) and ""The [Untold] Tillman Story"" at the feralfirefighter blog.

. . .

Amir Bar-Lev:  ""... when I've shown the film to left-wing audiences. Their takeaway is, `what a horrible [Bush] administration we just had!'  I think that's letting yourself off the hook, as if there were just a handful of bad apples, and `thank God they're gone.'""

Shortly after Sundance, Bar-Lev emailed me that ""he was pretty hard on the Democratic Congress in his film.""  True, his film does portray Congressman Henry Waxman's Oversight Committee as ineptly failing to get answers from the top military leadership during their hearing.

However, the film missed telling the ""untold story"" that President Obama and the Democratic Congress continued the Bush & Army cover-up by shielding Gen. Stanley McChrystal  (and other officers) from scrutiny of his central role in the cover-up of Pat Tillman's friendly-fire death.  This cover-up was a thoroughly bi-partisan affair. It wasn't just a case of the Bush administration and the Army stonewalling the Democratic Congress.  Congress didn't just ""fumble"" the ball, they threw the game.

It's not surprising that after their initial cover-up of Pat Tillman's friendly-fire death fell apart, Army officers and the Bush administration lied to protect themselves. But after they took control of Congress in 2006, the Democrats (including Senator Carl Levin, Senator James Webb, and Congressman Henry Waxman) could have gone after those responsible. Or at least not promoted them!

Just before the 2006 mid-term elections, Kevin Tillman published his eloquent letter, ""After Pat's Birthday"" at truthdig.com:

""Somehow our elected leaders were subverting international law and humanity by setting up secret prisons around the world, secretly kidnapping people, secretly holding them indefinitely, secretly not charging them with anything, secretly torturing them.  Somehow that overt policy of torture became the fault of a few ""bad apples"" in the military.""

""Somehow torture is tolerated. ... Somehow lying is tolerated.  ... Somehow faking character, virtue and strength is tolerated.  ... Somehow a narrative is more important than reality.""

""Somehow American leadership, whose only credit is lying to its people and illegally invading a nation, has been allowed to steal the courage, virtue and honor of its soldiers on the ground.  ... Somehow the same incompetent, narcissistic, virtueless, vacuous, malicious criminals are still in charge of this country. Somehow this is tolerated.  Somehow nobody is accountable for this.""

 Kevin had hoped a Democratic Congress would bring accountability back to our country. But, just as with warrant-less wiretapping and torture, those responsible for the cover-up of his brother's friendly-fire death have never been held accountable for their actions.

. . .

Amir Bar-Lev:  ""You don't make these films to show your friends and family. You make them to have an impact.  Screening the film there was part of a larger strategy to return Pat to his family and to restore the legacy Pat would have wanted.""

Last July, I sent Amir Bar-Lev a letter arguing his  film would have  greater ""impact"" if he also told the ""untold story"" of the complicity of President Obama  and the Democratic Congress in continuing the Bush administration & Army cover-up of Tillman's friendly-fire death up through Gen. McChrystal's June 2009 Senate confirmation.  But, he didn't update his film.

Consequently, ""The Tillman Story"" was ignored by the news media since it didn't reveal any ""news"" about the Tillman story.  The film simply wasn't very controversial.  Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who supervised much of the Army's cover-up and directed the writing of the fraudulent Silver Star (with fabricated witness statements), was barely a footnote.  And, the film failed to show how President Obama and Democratic Congress continued the Bush administration and Army cover-up to protect Gen. McChrystal (among others).  Largely because of a lack of publicity & controversy, the film had a peak showing at only 28 theaters (with a gross of only $800,000).

Hopefully, Amir Bar-Lev added extra features to his DVD that tell at least some of the ""untold"" story described  in ""The [Untold] Tillman Story"" at the feralfirefighter blog(including parallels to Yoni Netanyahu who died at Entebbe in 1976 and Rachel Corrie who  Pat Tillman called ""my hero"").",1295568000,36,8787,5.11438596491228

4324394,5,B004C39E3K,"""The Tillman Story"" is a powerful, hard-hitting documentary about the most famous enlistee in the U.S. armed forces following the Nine-Eleven attacks, Pat Tillman. He was a famous NFL football player. The Bush administration realized the publicity value of this celebrity. He and his brother enlisted together, and his reasons for signing up were really not made clear until this film. He and his brother served a term in Iraq and then went on for duty in Afghanistan. He was a bright, thoughtful young man who read some anti-war stuff by people like Noam Chomsky. He was killed in action in Afghhanistan and was awarded the Silver Star for heroism.
When he first died there was a great deal of ceremony regarding his heroic death. At one ceremony John McCain spoke. Then information began to leak out. His death was not by enemy fire but by friendly fire. This film was the first time I have ever heard such incidents referred to as fratricide. That's a very strong, loaded term.
In this film there are many interviews. Particularly effective are the ones by the mother, father and brother. The mother particularly demanded the truth and she was persistent and systematic in her pursuit of the truth. The military amd the highest levels of government were in on the lie about Pat's death. They knew that the cause was not enemy fire.
The mother at first believed that in the heat of battle, Pat's fellow soldiers shot indiscriminately out of fear and because they felt in great danger. The government investigated the case and reluctantly provided the family with a box of thousands of pages of evidentiary documents. One observer said they hoped to swamp the family with paper work which incidentally had all names redacted. The mother learned that Pat's fellow soldiers might have fired because they wanted to be in the action, to experience the exhilaration of combat.
The father was a lawyer who knew how to sift through the material. Eventually all of the family pressure resulted in a Congressional hearing where the top generals and former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld appeared. All of them denied knowledge and culpability. The administration had used Pat's death as a propaganda tool to boost the public's faith in the war effort.
This film is devastating in its revelations and has an important message for everyone. Nations often manipulate the news for their own purposes. Pat Tillman is still a hero and great patriot, and his family are also heroes and patriots.",1286582400,76,2475,4.909307875894988

4324397,2,B004C39E3K,"The Tillman Story opens today in theatrical release to a broader audience than its spotless run inside the festival circuit, met with suspiciously unanimous praise despite the narrative's potentially divisive nature.  Yet:  it is not crudely simplistic -- or ""divisive,"" for that matter -- for anyone to approximate that documentary filmmaker peers and festival screening audiences are somewhere on the political spectrum as solidly to the left as the iPhone 4 drops calls.  (Nerd humor.)  The broader distribution of this film incurs the stricter scrutiny of a more diverse audience, just as surely as we may admit that middle America has cultivated many more soldiers in proportion against those who may hail from inside the Beltway.  On the other hand, documentary films more than ever fail as a multiplex exhibition medium:  with the ubiquity of reality television and 1,000-channel line-ups, it takes Michael Moore's vaudeville antics for the vocal majority to justify choosing the genre over make-believe acts of cynical entertainment (running the gamut from Eat, Pray, Love to Avatar).  So be it.  And if the audience for this film only marginally enlarges its diversity in theatrical release, what will the reviews say?

So far, you can Google until ""I'm feeling lucky"" turns to ""I'm feeling owned"" and you won't find a single twitch from any established media (save for the New York Post, which is a tabloid I stay as far away from as Fox News on the boob tube).  It is this unanimity, rather than the film's own harrowing narrative, that bummed me out to such an extent that I question whether creative artists (the very soul of our society) value anymore the collective didactic discipline of searching for truth -- in the greatest traditions -- rather than drawing low-art caricatures inside utterly un-epic battles of petty egoes.  That great academic humility, of knowing that there are infinite unknowables, is meant to be the ultimate fruit of higher education.  Anything less is tantamount to being that insufferable part of the audience who wants to let you know how the movie will end, instead of watching the damn thing, or leaving.

Not only from sheepishness (being such the minority here), but also just to call out the film on its lack of nuance, there is little more to say than all that, before really digging into it.  All the same:  The Tillman Story is about a professional athlete in a sport that many people love, many people are indifferent about, and many people fundamentally dislike for its violence and overwhelming corporate capitalism.  Pat decided to become a soldier instead, but made it very clear that he wanted to go about it low-key and without favor.  Predictably, everyone betrayed this intention (arguably, too, his own family). The rest of the film is about that betrayal.

Pat is deployed, calls the war ""[...] illegal"" (by one person's account), comes back to the States, and is offered an honorable discharge with the ability to resume a full professional football contract.  Despite (allegedly) having just called the war ""[...] illegal,"" he rejects that offer and returns to war.  In a logistically dangerous canyon, from a split troop caused by a car breakdown, Pat bravely but maybe not (in hindsight) wisely storms up a hill accompanied by an Afghan in Afghan dress, and other rangers accidentally start shooting at the Afghan, presuming he is a Taliban fighter.  Pat emerges from cover, exclaims ""I'm [...] Pat Tillman!"" and gets shot in the confusion.  (Later, Pat's mother -- in no uncertain terms -- accuses the soldiers of murder, saying that they had a lust to kill.)  The Army hushes the surviving witnesses pending an inevitably long investigation -- surely this takes time during a war that has higher priorities, such as avoiding bullets and bombs -- but the news media takes off with the story (remember, some Americans love football).  Hastily (and wrongly), someone in the military, or a few people in the military, or the entire Federal government in stunning lockstep, withholds the detail that Pat was killed by friendly fire (or as Pat's mom would have it, lustful killing fire) amidst all the world's attention.  It is possible that he/they/everyone on the flowchart adjudged this to be the most graceful way for the family to remember a hero, or it is possible that he/they/everyone behaved like warmongers and negated the truth solely to sustain positive propaganda.  Pat's family wants to know.  I sure would.

At the formal funeral, Pat's youngest brother goes up to the podium in jeans and an undershirt holding a glass of beer, chugs a bit, and says, ""Pat isn't with God, he's [...] dead. He wasn't religious. So thank you for your thoughts, but he's [...] dead.""  Director Amir Bar-Lev asks if he regrets that years later, and his answer is hell no.

Pat's mother and father continue pursuing the case separately (they are divorced) and Mr. Tillman, a small-town lawyer, writes a letter to the highest levels of government that ends with, ""[...] you.""  An Inspector General opens an investigation and concludes that it was inappropriate to withhold the information about Pat's death by friendly fire.  The Tillmans still want confessions from everyone on the flowchart of their minds, and they press on with a bi-partisan Congressional hearing where the military's top brass recite that they cannot remember precise dates and manners that this all went down because they were in the middle of managing a war.  (No less, Pat's wish, to not be treated specially inside his larger call of duty, rings in our ears; or it doesn't.)

One of the soldiers who was closest to Pat, who provides the most insistent narratives and opinions in the film (such as the account of Pat saying the war is ""[...] illegal""), refuses to complete his duty and a military tribunal charges him for violating the law.  You might think that his resolve to serve was as fragile as this relative political news blip -- and he does say in the film that he only joined the military simply to get a scholarship.

All of this is in the film.  It is one of the most beloved documentaries of our time, perceived as a slam-dunk invective against our government.  So far.  If it wins Best Documentary at Hollywood's annual celebration of itself, the unanimous like-minded community will leap to its feet, believing that the world has changed.

There are caveats to end with here.  I have deep respect for the men and women who put themselves in harm's way:  even just by enlisting, they outdo everything I've done for my country over a lifetime.  I am grateful to Pat Tillman and his family in this regard, unqualified.  And one more thing:  It is possible to have disagreed with the decision to go to war all along (as I did and still do), yet watch this film and be revolted by its simplistic caricatures, its stunningly agnostic treatment of arrogant assumptions, and most of all, its missed opportunity to glorify Pat Tillman:  one American hero among thousands in uniforms, not jerseys.  That's how he wanted to be seen.  Or so I assume.",1283472000,17,7086,4.910159529806885

The military has been sooooo canonized (i.e. the journalist who exposed the corruption and unfounded hubris of General Stanley McChrystal in The Rolling Stone said at the height of the war there were over 28,000 public relation specialists who were literally 'selling' us the war - - a journalist who later died in a suspicious ""one car accident"" by the way)......that we have forgotten to implement mindful checks and balances against these war profiteers.

4324407,5,B004C39E3K,"Pat Tillman Jr. was truly an American hero who was humble about his accomplishments in reality. He was a professional football player who left a comfortable life on the football field to enlist in the United States Army. Like thousands of others, he was killed but the truth has never been clarified about his death. Was it friendly fire or something sinister? What was worse about his murder was the senseless government cover-up?

Pat Tillman's family deserved the truth whether it was a terrible accident or deliberate murder. In this gripping documentary, you relate to the Tillmans as the all-American family and Pat as the all-American son. When Pat died, he didn't want a funeral with military honors despite pressure from the military. His family fought for the truth from their own government. Of course, they're angry not just about Pat's death/murder but about the cover-up involving everybody from the top officials in government.

If you want to watch a gripping documentary about the Tillman family and their quest for justice in Pat's death, this documentary will make you feel angry and frustrated but also hopeful as well. The Tillmans aren't going to stop find out the truth about his death. Pat and his family deserved more just like thousands of other military families who have lost soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

4324429,5,B004C39E3K,"Lets deal with the R rating first.  Theres no nudity here, and no scenes of graphic violence nor drug use.  The R rating must be based solely on conversations regarding the killing of both American and foreign fighters, as well as some vulgarity including the F-word, though some of that (such as talk broadcast over TV) had been silenced.

Possible spoiler alert: although I will not go into the actual details on how Pat died, I'll cover a lot of other ground the film reviews.  Pretty much everyone knows the basics of the Tillman story: a professional football player who gave up a multi-million dollar contract to join the Army Rangers and fight in Afghanistan after 9/11.  Hes killed over there; the Army initially portrays it as a courageous death from Taliban fire while charging up a hill and saving his fellow soldiers lives.  Then strange facts start to emerge, like all of his clothing, armor, everything on him that day having been burned and all trace disappearing.  The family, now suspicious, repeatedly asks the military questions.  Eventually a large box containing what was said to be the entire file used for the official investigation, is turned over to thembut with so many details blacked out (like the name of every other soldier present, every location, etc) that it was almost useless.  The family found an ex-military blogger with obvious extensive military experience who agreed to help them try to sort it all out.  In the meantime the military reversed course and admitted that Tillman had been accidentally killed by friendly fire.  The initial person to take the heat was the Army spokesperson who had appeared on TV in the weeks and months immediately after Tillmans death, portraying the incorrect version of events.

After extensive further investigations and communication from Tillmans family leading to one Congressional hearing, a full panoply of military officials up to Donald Rumsfeld were questioned.  Strangely, all of them seemed afflicted with a severe case of amnesia.  A second investigation eventually blamed only one other officer, who had already retired, and who officially lost one of his stars as a consequence.

The Tillman family (and others) obviously saw an extensive conspiracy among the military and civilian command layers, strengthened by the finding of one high-level P-4 memo circulated to all the top brass alerting them to the conclusion that Tillmans death was by friendly fire but asking them not to divulge the information.  President Bush spoke publicly about Tillmans great heroism and sacrifice for his country, without ever mentioning his being killed by friendly fire.  Had he also seen the memo or been verbally advised of the conclusions?  Naturally, no one who would know would admit to that fact, although listening to Bushs wording, it was vague enough not to specify how Pat was killed.  That in itself could easily be read in two ways: as typical of Bushs (non)involvement with the families or with wounded veterans, he showed no personal interest in them, or else that he was maintaining a cover-up he knew about.  The highest level most logically involved was Donald Rumsfeld, who had sent Tillman a personal letter of congratulations when he enlisted as a private, but then had total amnesia regarding the circumstances of his death.

This film does not rely on re-enactments.  It makes use of actual footage, including from Tillmans football career, wedding, funeral service, President Bush on TV, the congressional hearing, old photos from his childhood, as well as direct interviews of family members, some of his squad mates who were willing to talk, the investigator the Tillmans obtained, his former coach, his wife, and representative photos of redacted documents.
At one point, an official investigator is heard in a conversation blaming the familys refusal to let go of his death, and their suspicions on their lack of religious beliefs, because it must be hard to accept, when death is just the end of everything and going to the worms or words to that effect, which sounds plausible for a second, until one imagines how you would react if you lost a loved one and it became apparent you were being lied to by officials about what really happened.

For me personally, the most galling scene was the end of the congressional hearing, at which one can see Rumsfeld and top military officials standing up, Rumsfeld at the least with a big grin on his face, all shaking hands and congratulating each other, rather than showing any apparent humility, remorse or even sympathy for the family.

I will save this much and more for you to see yourself if you haven't watched the film: the actual details of how and why Tillman was shot by his fellow US forces.  To the familys credit, despite what appears to be blatant recklessness at a minimum, they make no effort to assign blame to any of Tillmans fellow team members but rather are interested in uncovering how far up the conspiracy to suppress the truth went, and how it was used in an effort to drum up more recruits and enthusiasm for the war rather than to simply publicly admit that an American everyone was proud of was killed by friendly fire
.
Mention is also made that Tillman and his brother had both expected to be sent directly to Afghanistan, which after all was the country that harbored bin Laden and his allies and was controlled by the Taliban.  Instead they were initially deployed to Iraq when Bush & company decided to invade there.  He returned on leave from Iraq more than disgusted, rather infuriated at what he felt from firsthand observation was an illegal and immoral war.  He even had an opportunity to leave the service early, as he was offered another professional football contract and the Army informed him it would have given him an early and honorable discharge if he wanted to signbut he chose to stick out his full enlistment, resulting in his death.

Although free with swear words and admittedly not personally religious, Tillman had a rare combination of talents: great strength speed and coordination, a genuine interest in other people no matter how different their backgrounds, and an intelligent, inquisitive mind.  When not physically busy, he read intellectually demanding works of wide diversity.  His death at a young age really was a loss for our countryhad he been able to stick it out in the military and learned not to offend superiors with too many outspoken opinions contradicting theirs, it looks to me like he could have made a fine generalof the type we certainly could use; one interested in the truth, in the morality of our actions, and talented enough to have capably been involved in strategic planning or to have led large numbers of troops in combat operations when the country found it necessary.

This film, focused on one person and one family, ends up being a microcosm of the mismanagement and outright deceptions that existed at the top through most of the Bush administration.  Finally in his second term Bush had enough sense to replace Rumsfeld with Gates, who served with great distinction and was retained by President Obama until Mr. Gates himself chose to leave [increasingly frustrated, it seems, with the plans and the projected scope of budget cuts, and the size and pace of planned troop reductions].

Since this film doesn't use professional actors and doesn't cover dramatically new ground about our government or military, I don't give it the rating I reserve for films with a major place in film history--but it is definitely well-done and worth watching.  My interest certainly never flagged.",1421625600,4,7616,4.951334379905808

Pat Tillman, for whatever reason, felt the need to go fight. maybe it was all the propaganda (repeat: ""This is NOT Viet Nam..this is NOT Viet nam..""). Maybe it was to test himself. Maybe it was to carry family tradition

Tillman reminded me so much of one of my students. He was so itching to go to fight, to save the USA, to stop terrorists. I had long talks with him and he was so proud to be in uniform, to represent his country. Upon return he was so bitter. He said it was all a lie, and he was surrounded by 18-19 year old boys who wanted to be soldiers, or bad asses, or they believed the propaganda, too.

This documentary proves there are all sorts of crime. The crime of firing at your own company because you are scared, or angry, or need a release. The crime of lying to the country you represent and the families of the brave young man who died. The crimes of conspiracy, lying on the stand, creating a smoke & mirrors so no one knows the truth. It also shows there are different rules and laws for the rich and powerful.

The fact that Tillman's brother made an ass out of himself at the memorial was expected, because VIP's who spoke at the memorial did not know the family's non-religious beliefs.

It was saddening of course, and a loss of a guy who by all accounts was a great man, but I was secure in the knowledge that ""hey, sometimes mistakes happen in war unfortunately"".  About halfway through the documentary, Pat's mother drops a bombshell word that made my ears perk up ""fratricide"".  I thought she used the words mistakenly, but what followed was the story that I don't think most of us know, or that the government or mainstream media led us to know.  It's really outrageous how the government's attempts to cover up, fabricate and exploit this man's death played out, especially with the subsequent hearings.  It's truly shameful.  As is the media's complicity in pushing these idealized narratives which just aren't true to who he was, and would probably object to and reject were he alive.  Ultimately though, this story is an inspirational one, in that the family never faded away quietly in an attempt to expose the truth about their son.  Pat Tillman was a hero, but not the conveniently giftwrapped one the gov't and media want to sell to us.

I admire that they did not just ""sink into grief"" and let the military chain of command and Bush Administration use the circumstances of Pat's tragic death as propaganda to buoy public support for the Iraq and Afghanistan War.

I know the government is capable of complicity, deception, and that what's said and done behind closed doors contradicts the public face/image. However, to see an example of such deceit, really makes me shake my head. Shame on those responsible.

4324465,5,B004C39E3K,"Yet that is EXACTLY what the Army did.

The documentary even reveals that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent Pat Tillman a letter to congratulate him for enlisting in 2002, and internal memos reveal that the Army and the White House wanted to keep an eye on this kid during his deployment, presumably to milk it for all it was worth.  An NFL star in the Army --  what a great propaganda tool.

When Tillman was killed, even some of the soldiers on the ground at the scene knew it was friendly fire, but they were quickly hushed.  About a week after Tillman died, and a full three weeks before his family was notified of the Friendly Fire status, George W. Bush's speechwriters were advised to refrain from making specific comments about the way Tillman died ""just on the outside chance that the truth would come out and embarrass the Army and the White House""  (in other words, Bush needed to be vague so as not to be caught in a lie.  Being vague was one thing he was very good at).

The Army never missed a chance to be disrespectful to the deceased's wishes or to his family.  The media grabbed onto Tillman's death for exactly what is was being spun to be -- propaganda and good ratings.

The scene in the documentary where Rumsfeld and an assortment of Army brass play the ""I don't recall"" card is almost too familiar-sounding nowadays to even raise eyebrows anymore.

Make no mistake -- Tillman was an unfortunate casualty of a false war, and his death was shamelessly prostituted for political gain and the the circumstances surrounding his death were cloaked in lies, all the way up to the highest levels of the military.

""The Tillman Story"" is a tribute to the tenacity of Pat's mom but a shameful reminder of exactly how powerless we are to shine a light on our own government's deplorable and amoral behavior.",1332633600,,1828,4.57361963190184

1) The story of Pat Tillman, as he grew up and excelled in high school football in California, followed by four years with the Arizona State University Sun Devils and four years of professional football with the Arizona Cardinals.  After marrying his high-school sweetheart in early 2002, he volunteered with his brother Kevin to serve in the US Army, and in early 2003 both completed an assignment of less than three months in Iraq before returning with their unit to the US for further training in Ranger School.  They left with their Ranger unit on April 7 2004 for Afghanistan, where Pat was killed on April 22 2004.

2) The story of Pat's family to uncover the true circumstances of his death, which turned out to be quite different from the version presented to the public at a memorial service in California on May 3 2004.

The story is told by about a dozen participants.  (To assist first-time viewers in keeping straight who is who as the story unfolds, the first column shows approximate times for the first appearance of each individual accompanied by an identifying label.)

Once the truth was told to the family the film takes an obivous anti-war twist and the family interviews just to give their opinions. This seems like less of a documentary as it a conspiracy theory that he was killed on purpose by a squad-mate! The family display much mistrust for the military and the government. I wanted to watch to learn about his life not how much his family felt it was a mistake for him to join. I will always pray and honor Pat Tillman to be able to walk away from the life style he did. No doubt he is the most extreme example we can have to be patriotic, but his family tries to make it not look that way. His own mother is a hypocrite stating ""He's not a saint he was just a human"". Yes he is not a saint and he is a human but he was a unique circumstance than a ""normal soldier"".

4324472,5,B004C39E3K,"Quite extraordinary documentary dealing with the emotional and
intellectual issues around Pat Tillman's death in Afghanistan and
subsequent Army cover-up. A film of insight, humanity, and righteous
anger, but it never feels manipulative of the people or facts involved.

Like Tillman himself, it avoids simplistic answers and tries to look
deeper. This isn't a propaganda piece, but a complex study of a
family's grief, and how powerful organizations like the Army sometimes
put their own image ahead of human honesty and decency.

Tillman himself emerges as a highly complex man - someone who didn't go
off to war looking for glory, and indeed, tried actively just to be
treated like any other soldier - a desire the Army refused to honor,
even in death (Tillman had specifically, in writing. requested not to
have a military funeral should he die in war, but the Army tried to
bulldoze the family into one for PR purposes).

He believed the Afghanistan war was a righteous cause, but politically
disagreed with the decision to go to war with Iraq, while fighting with
honor and distinction. He was an atheist who respected and was curious
about all religions, and whose public memorial was co-opted by public
figures invoking the name of God, until finally his little brother - in
an act of slightly drunken bravery - stood up to tell them all that
wasn't who Pat was.

His family emerge as heroes of another kind, working tirelessly to
discover the truth of what really happened to their son and why,all the
while fighting an Army and political establishment that just wanted
them to stand there mute, and look sad and grateful for the cameras.

Amir Bar-Lev is emerging as one of our best documentary filmmakers, and
I'd urge you to also check out his earlier work ""My Kid Could Paint
That"" and ""Fighter"".",1318464000,3,1809,4.8603896103896105

So the contradiction at the heart of American ideals, indeed democracies' ideals, is revealed in this excellent documentary on ""All American"" Pat Tillman - a ""poster boy"" if ever there was one. Mr Tillman was the product of a privileged white middle class family whose
members had a tradition of serving the country in the armed forces.  Honour, truth, integrity, and patriotism are words that fall easily from the lips of the powerful and not so powerful throughout this documentary - and Pat Tillman believed in these words. But the actions of many in his story reveal he was badly let down by his leaders, by the institution he served, and ultimately by his country. A retired Ranger and his mother are pictured as perhaps representative of the better side of the ideal Pat Tillman tried to live up to.

Director Amir Bar-Lev has presented an objective view of the situation, family attitudes, and observations from many involved. The family got (sorta) closure. Interesting to know that Tillman's family was atheistic, so the death was accepted fairly well, though not the cover-up. It's good to see some important military big shots  up before the Supreme Court, blithering like idiots, blaming everyone but themselves.

I did not know that much about the details of Pat Tillman's death and even less about the coverup that involved the highest defense officials in the country including our Commander-in-Chief.  Terrible lies were told, not only to the Tillman family but to the American people.  Selling a war to the masses is tricky business and selling an unjust war requires lies.  This film documents a death that the government used to sell the war.

I applaud the Tillman family for fighting for the truth.  I only hope that more of these families exist in today's America.  In my opinion the fight was worth it because it opened my eyes.

4324479,4,B004C39E3K,"I am intrigued by this story (how could you not be?) but, I was not impressed with my initial viewing of this movie.

As I watch (and review) this film, I am more interested in it's cinematic quality rather than looking at it from judging Tillman's family, the military or the government. Remember, this is not hardcore, investigative journalism, rather, it's just a documentary movie. As difficult as it is to say, because of the subject matter, it's supposed to be entertainment.

When viewing this, I was most interested in Pat Tillman. What was he like? Why would he forego an NFL career? You would always see his famed army profile photograph but I wanted to know more about this man. And that is what this film accomplished.

This movie skips around a lot. It does not neccessarily move in a chronological order. At first, I did not like that since it made the story seem fragmented and confusing. But, towards the end of the movie and after watching it a second time, I realized what the film maker was doing. Jumping all over the place allowed a focus to be on Pat Tillman... the individual. To move in chronological order would have addressed the personal life of him and then leave that essential aspect of the film in the dust, as the story would then progress towards just focusing on a governmental coverup and it's impact on Tillman's family. That expected , logical approach would have improperly diluted what this movie should be about...Pat Tillman the person, not the soldier.

The basis of the story is quite simple here. Pat Tillman died from ""friendly fire"" and the government tried to initially contort that embarassment by pushing a pro-war propaganda.

The interesting aspect about this film is that what the government was trying to promote Tillman as...he was not! And his family picked up on it immediately. Pat Tillman was no rah-rah, gung ho soldier as the government was trying to portray him. Rather, he was a wayward, very free spirited person.

The best part of this movie, which the spralling direction did a great job at, was portraying Tillman's free spirited ways, and how his family and friends recognized that and utilized that knowledge in rejecting the government's initial account of what had occured.

War is so ugly and inherent within it are issues like this but this movie does a good job at creating apprehension in the viewer towards the government.

It is inevitable that after watching this film, the viewer has a very positive impression of Pat Tillman and ponders ""what a huge tragic waste of a man's life"".",1315008000,,2559,4.773755656108597

4324482,5,B004C39E3K,"The Pat Tillman story represents many things. It represents an ideal, self-sacrifice, and the depths of deceit. It is about the best in us and the worst. It is about what length one man will do for his country and what lengths people will go to use a man's deeds and memory for political gain.

He was a rare breed who enlisted throwing away a multi-million dollar football contract.  Providing perimeter security for the phony rescue operation of PFC Jessica Lynch, he knew he could be used in the same way. Disillusioned with what he thought was an illegal war, Tillman went on his second tour to Afghanistan even though the army was willing to give him an honorable discharge after Iraq.  This is the tour that killed him, and this is where the deceit begins.

Tillman was killed by his fellow soldiers, but he was awarded the Silver Star for actions against the enemy. His soldiers were told to keep silent about the true circumstances of his death. His clothes and personal belongings were burned. The military attempted to pressure Tillman's widow, Marie to allow him to be buried at Arlington with full military honors.

The Tillman's began to ask questions after the shock of their loss. Dannie, Pat's mother, received boxes of blacked out information, and his father, a lawyer, questioned the stack of reams of testimony. His letter expressing his doubts and scorn for the military triggered an investigation by the Inspector General. Lt. Gen. Phillip Kensinger became the fall guy and was demoted to major general.  The Tillmans didn't believe it ended there after they had received an anonymously delivered P4 memo. It was a highly classified correspondence from General Stanley McChrystall for only the highest levels in the chaim of command. In it he stated that Tillman was probablly killed by friendly fire. It was written days before he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.

It triggered a congressional inquiry but Generals Abizaid, Brown, Myers and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld could not remember any memo that described Tillman's death by friendly fire just days after. In fact, they couldn't recall 82 times. Proof that the order was known at the highest levels of government went nowhere. Pat Tillman became in death what he didn't want to be in life--a political football, a man who enlisted for the love his country was being used by his country for propaganda.

Seeing the face of a distraught mother (even during ceremonies honoring him is tough to watch), a father's rage and a brother's grief. It's even tougher to see how the family's attempt to bring the government's deceit to light failed.  Nevertheless I felt compelled to watch every bit of it and replayed much of it to make sure I pieced everything together.

Around 2002 i started reading lots of material on 911 and the victims families on 911 and to say that i became disillusioned with the government is a huge understatement. The 911 victims families got no answers just government rhetoric and lots of ""cant recalls"" .
  This film made me terribly sad almost to the point of tears for the whole Tillman family,Father,Mother,Brothers,Wife,Friends . While you ask yourself why he went back for his second tour of duty you can see where he got his convictions and morals from , both his parents are awesome . The truly sad thing is how useless all the soldiers are to the U.S government,nothing but tools and pawns in their war games and manipulations to attain more oil and wealth and power and these congressman put their glasses on and pretend to be interested in getting information out of these generals and its all a big production,pure garbage,liars and disgusting congressman and all government officials .

Then, the ultra-fans of the Bush Jr. administration (ahem, fox ""news"") could write this documentary off as some wacko's one-sided, manipulating-the-facts work. However, this film -- directed by Amir Bar-Lev -- shows both sides of the spectrum ... and it comes directly from the family of Pat Tillman and their tireless research. Unfortunately, for the Bush Jr. administration, it doesn't cast them in the best light; particularly former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. As any talking head on Fox News might say (I can hear it now), ""Amir Bar-Lev? Sounds middle eastern! He's a Muslim sympathizer!"" Actually, Mr. Bar-Lev is an American, born and raised in California, and has no affiliation with the Muslim religion. But it's not the filmmaker's intention to make Rumsfeld and his staff to be the ""bad guy."" No, they do that all themselves in actual Congressional Oversight Committee video footage regarding Tillman's death. This film should be essential viewing for anyone wanting to see the true business of contemporary government politics and warfare, as well as for anyone who is considering joining the military. This is truly one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time where there is no subject that's left ""open for interpretation."" All of the lies, screw-ups, incompetence and C.Y.A. (Cover Your @$$) tactics are all there in the open, for all to see. I had to watch the film twice because it stirred such anger in me; I can only imagine how Mr. Tillman's family must feel, knowing his death was used as mere propaganda for a war he did not agree with. (Critic's Note: I support the soldiers; it's the (Iraqi) war they're being sent in to that I'm not so sure about.)",1308787200,,1822,4.899676375404531
4324488,5,B004C39E3K,"Propaganda is every bit as important to war as weapons and soldiers. If the military and the government can't get the public to support the war, the war won't happen.

The Tillman family was only the latest in a long line of families who have seen their children's deaths in battle covered up by military propaganda.

Jessica Lynch, prominently featured here, was also a pawn of propaganda, but fortunately for her, she didn't die.

One feels a certain fatigue in watching this eloquent documentary. What else could the military do, but cover up its mistake? How could the war go on if the mistake wasn't covered up? Every scene is predictable, though the anguish of the family (an unusual, admirable family) is very moving.

When our troops slaughtered 500 civilians in the village of My Lai (by the way, they went to the wrong village, they were supposed to engage the Viet Cong on the other side of the province) the military reported that they had killed 123 Viet Cong.

Ah, but the pictures. The pictures of the slaughtered Vietnamese peasants, began to turn public opinion against the war. The pictures from Abu Graibh began to turn public opinion against the war in Iraq.

Not enough, though. Vietnam lasted six more years after My Lai. We are still in Iraq. Daniel Ellsberg, after leaking the Pentagon papers, said,""What if you give the public the truth, they understand it, they appreciate it, and they proceed to do nothing?""

The passivity of the citizenry can allow a war to go on long after its absurdity has been convincingly shown.

My only criticism of the Tillmans is that they want a scumbag like Donald Rumsfeld to acknowledge that Pat died by friendly fire. A hypocrite like Rumsfeld can't grant their wish. It's his job to lie. The whole world knows the truth, thanks to the documentary and Jon Krakauer's book.

In the end, one must go back to Sigmund Freud, who said, ""The government reserves violence for itself, forbidding violence to the individual. The violence is like a monopoly.""

So, propaganda, combined with the passivity of the civilians who do not protest, is the real secret to keeping wars going indefinitely.",1308355200,,2146,4.807065217391305

If you harbored any doubts about the extent to which the government will go to protect itself and advance its own agenda, those doubts will be laid to rest by this movie. You cannot help but be drawn to the Tillman family. Perhaps the best aspect of this movie is the touching and sometimes humurous look into the Tillmans' personal lives. From Pat's parents to his brothers to his widow, this movie allows us to see them for who they are versus the image which the government wanted to portray. It was bad enough that Pat Tillman was taken under the most tragic of circumstances. The family then found itself in a tug of war with the government to retain Pat's true identity and prevent their son from being further exploited in death.

Actor Josh Brolin, who portrays George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone movie W., narrates THE TILLMAN STORY, and that is closest the man the Supreme Court installed as president has come to the truth about Pat Tillman's death.

I don't know if there has been a film detailing the true story of Jessica Lynch, but we already have enough for a double feature with the documentaries THE TILLMAN STORY and BODY OF WAR.  THE TILLMAN STORY shows the masters of war would rather sweep a dead soldier under the carpet unless they can use him as propaganda, which is what they do with pro athlete-turned-Army Ranger Pat Tillman.  BODY OF WAR depicts how they also essentially apply the rug option to living albeit paralyzed veteran Tomas Young; this guy didn't play in the National Football League, after all.  Between the reprehensible exploitation of Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman, the blind eye and deaf ear turned to Tomas Young, and the futility of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a mass desertion by the United States armed forces would not surprise me.

Sometimes I want to avoid a situation if I don't know what to say, and that might be the case were I to encounter Pat Tillman's survivors after seeing THE TILLMAN STORY scene of a Congressional hearing where the usually righteous California Representative Henry Waxman refuses to acknowledge the elephant in the room as Donald Rumsfeld and other military brass lie about their knowledge of Pat Tillman's death.

That was an accident.

There is no doubt in my mind the USG at levels far above the command element in the field not only knew but tragically built a story of Tillman's death into some sort of public relations initiative to support the so called ""Bush's war on terror"". The Bush people with complicity of the generals in the chain of command were also an integral part of the coverup.  The coverup began after command elements within Pat's unit contact higher..and that began the lies to the American public, Pat's family and to all those who sacrificed wearing the uniform of the United States of America.

Eventually the Americn Government released thousands of heavily redacted documents which his mother and father managed to piece together to reveal the lie they and the American people had been 'sold'. After much pressure a Congressional Committee of Inquiry interviewed those responsible for oversight of matters in Aghanistan.
Anyone watching the televised course of this Committee of Inquiry must have been perplexed at the leniency of the
interrogation of the Army's top brass and particularly that of Mr Rumsfield, who had proved so eloquent as the President's main spokesmann on the course of events in pursuit of El Queada, but was so tongue-tied when responding to the Chair's Inqiries about this affair.

Pat Tillman gave up a multimillion dollar contract in the NFL to give some payback to the villains of 9/11. He didn't do it for the glory, he constantly rejected the utilization of his service for propaganda purposes, He certainly wasn't motivated by money. He did it because he believed it was the right thing to do.
The last day of his life, the military unit he was assigned to made a number of unwise, precarious moves that led to his own (split) unit firing at itself in the shadows of twilight in a steep Afghan valley setting. This was a horrendous situation, but then the military made up a story that was more advantageous to their purposes. Their story was heroic, romantic, but blatently false, and self-serving. As is usually the case, it was the Tillman family that suffered, while the military used the story for propaganda, to boost their sagging reputation after Abu Grieb, and other fiascos.
The Tillman family ends up the heroes in this story, fighting, and fighting to get the truth out.

The story is told in broad brush strokes and for those who already know something about the Tillman controversy, there is nothing really new in this documentary.  The strength of this film is the interviews conduced with Tillman's family and former army colleagues. Their words humanise the documentary's subject and give him a dimension that the US government, military and media stole from him.

I found the DVD itself a little disappointing.  When it was first announced that The Tillman Story was to be released on DVD, some websites reported that the disc would include extra content such as a featurette on Pat's legacy.  Unfortunately, the disc has only one special feature - a commentary with the director.  As with the film, there is very little new information revealed in the commentary.

For me, the most interesting part of the commentary was hearing why the director didn't disclose the names of the men who shot (and ultimately killed) Pat and an Afghan solider.  He said that it would be ""unfair"".  I found the comment odd.  Regardless of what punishment they received, their culpability is a matter of public record.  As such, I think it would have been more honest had the men been named.  That said this is a small point.  The purpose of the documentary is to explore the myth making that ensued when Pat died.  In this regard, the documentary succeeds.

All in all, The Tillman Story is worthwhile exercise even though it is frustrating that there isn't a more fulfilling or just ending.

A gung-ho Ranger who turned down the kind of life his co-warriors could only dream of, who intellectualized about the war, wrote to Noam Chomsky, was not aboard with the ""mission"": all these could well add up, giving motive of strong resentment from fellow grunts and officers alike.  The next logical question would be how high up did this resentment reach?  Of course, we'll never know.  Only those pulling the trigger are ever exposed to repercussions, and in this case part of ""the plan"" was to  deflect all suspicion by turning him into a Bush-era war hero.
