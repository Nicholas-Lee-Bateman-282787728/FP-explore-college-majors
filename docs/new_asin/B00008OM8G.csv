8188834,3,B00008OM8G,"CONTENTS of FUTURE COPS 4 Movie Pack:

ASSASSIN-- TV movie starring Robert Conrad (""The Wild, Wild West"") as a retired CIA agent who's battling a human-looking rogue robot programmed to kill government officials.

BRONX EXECUTIONER-- For an authentic-looking NYC sci-fier, film it in Italy, right? Well.... The best stuff here is the recycled Woody Strode material cribbed from another spaghetti special known in America as ""The Last Warrior."" Storyline: a cyborg rampages through a New York borough (guess which one).

HANDS OF STEEL-- Smells like ""The Terminator"" (accent on the aroma). A cyborg is programmed to kill a scientist who holds mankind's fate in his manos... er... HANDS.

WARRIORS OF THE WASTELAND-- An Italianate twist on post-apocalyptic movies like the Mad Max series. Here, two mercenaries aid wandering caravans by waging war against evil bikers.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.

8188835,3,B00008OM8G,"The films included in this collection are nice, old trash-movies, especially ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" with the great George Eastman a.k.a. Luigi Montefiori. However, the quality is VERY bad. I know 20 years old tapes that have a better picture. Plus the picture-format is not the original one (for exmaple ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" is included in 1,33:1, but its original format is 2,35:1 (Cinemascope) !!!). The main reasons why should buy this box anyway is:

a)Some films included are available on DVD for the first time

b)It's damn cheap !

BUT I've you already own this titles as good quality tapes, you needn't buy this since the quality surely isn't any better.

By the way, the DVD-edition of ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" (a.k.a. ""New Barbarians"") from ""Shriek show"" is much better, but costs more than this whole box.

Sadly, the DVDs are flippers, so watch out for sratches !",1141171200,,890,4.906666666666666
8188836,5,B00008OM8G,My worn down VHS copy of The New Barbarians aka. Warriors of the Wasteland can rest at last! This classic Spaghetti Post-Nuke is worth the price of this DVD alone. Plus 'Hands of Steel' and 'The Bronx Executioner' are on there too. This is futuristic Italian Nirvana!,1060560000,5,267,4.702127659574468
