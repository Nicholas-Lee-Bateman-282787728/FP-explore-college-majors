8328817,1,B001O21IBS,"Very slow, boring, and unoriginal.

An element lowering the quality of this documentary wanna be; is the lack of diversity from the interviewee's and more importantly the quality of questions raised from the interviewer.

The Film-Maker stops short of interviewing anyone other than his family and friends in his direct geographic location (So Ca); which is itself is a very flawed data gathering method.

All the people that participated in the interviews (not more than 10 people total) were hard to understand (Heavy accent), and didn't answer any questions with depth.

If you like to watch bad film making, about people that don't present anything smart, useful, funny, or in any way or shape entertaining; then this DVD is for you !

Not worth the time or money, I wish I could get both back !",1242432000,,799,4.845588235294118
