As the name suggests, Uncle Grandpa is a very odd show.  I'm not even sure how to describe it other than it being ""face palm"" funny.  The main character, Uncle Grandpa, helps kids by taking them on adventures to solve their problems.  While he does have the ability to replicate himself and conjure up items from thin air, he often makes things harder on himself than necessary.

Uncle Grandpa is often accompanied by his friends Belly Bag (his fanny pack), Pizza Steve, Mister Gus, and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger.  Whenever Uncle Grandpa's  RV needs that extra boost, Giant Realistic Flying Tiger happily helps out with his rainbow flatulence.
The Good Mornin' DVD collection features twelve episodes and runs for 132 minutes.  Here's a list of the episodes in this collection:

Brain Game - Pizza Steve claims to be the best gamer ever - can he put his skills on the line to help out a kid?
Moustache Cream - Uncle Grandpa needs some moustache cream in a hurry; can he get it in time?
Nickname - All of the kids but one have nicknames, so Uncle Grandpa helps that kid earn his.
Locked Out - Uncle Grandpa gets locked out of his RV; how will he get back in?
Mystery Noise - During a sleep over Uncle Grandpa and friends cannot fall asleep due to a weird noise.  They tear apart the RV looking for it.  Can they find the source of it?
Bad Morning - Uncle Grandpa is miserable when he wakes up on the wrong side of his bed.  His friends attempt to correct the problem.
Bezt Friends - Everyone but Pizza Steve agrees to be Uncle Grandpa's best friend.  Will Pizza Steve reconsider?
Hide and Seek - Uncle Grandpa is afraid to play hide and seek after never finding one of his friends.  Will he overcome his fear and join in the fun?
The History of Wrestling - Uncle Grandpa and Mister Gus show people how real wrestling is done.
Vacation - Uncle Grandpa needs to take a vacation from helping people.  After arriving at a remote island he finds out he's their only hope from stopping a devastating volcanic eruption.  Will he help them?
Aunt Grandma - Uncle Grandpa is  being upstaged by a new person helping kids in need.  There's not enough room for both of them.
Grounded - Uncle Grandpa unwittingly helps a kids escape from being grounded.  Now he must outsmart this kid to get back into his room.

All of the episodes are wacky and my kids are now fans of the show.  Like most cartoons out there, you can expect to find cartoon violence and potty humor.  If that doesn't bother you, this DVD is worth owning for its $10 price tag.",1427500800,4,2595,4.453389830508475
6989611,5,B00SJFV74G,My kid laughs his little butt off every time he watches these. Thanks CN for coming up with such impressive shows.,1471219200,,114,4.476190476190476
6989612,5,B00SJFV74G,"Uncle Grandpa is chock full of outlandish absurdist humor. Some feel the show is too silly and low-brow, however I think it's a throwback to a time when cartoons were actually funny, full of gags that produce honest to goodness laughter.

The show revolves around Uncle Grandpa going from town to town in his magical RV and helping children in need. His crew assisting him in his journeys included Mr. Gus, a deadpan dinosaur, Pizza Steve, an egotistical slice of pizza who exaggerates his coolness, Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, who flies with rainbows coming out of their rear, and Belly Bag, a talking fanny pack.

Each show usually consists of a 12 minute adventure with additional skits tossed in for good measure. Some of the skits feature additional characters such as Beary Nice, a teddy bear who always enjoy new things, and Hot Dog Person, who is forever getting maimed and injured trying new things.

The animation is solid, if not spectacular. It is certainly of Saturday morning cartoon quality.

All in all, Uncle Grandpa is a bright, silly, and downright funny. This DVD is slightly over two hours long and features some of the earliest shows from the show's early beginnings. I can not recommend it enough.",1464393600,2,1222,4.860576923076923
6989613,4,B00SJFV74G,"Whether it's midday, the late afternoon, or the dead of night, you can surely know it's gonna be a ""Good Morning"" when your Uncle Grandpa comes to visit.  And in this second DVD volume, there's 12 more adventures starring him and all his friends such as:

""Brain Game"" - Pizza Steve's gaming skills are put to the test when helping out a kid in need.
""Moustache Cream"" - Uncle Grandpa goes to the store and desperately tries to find some moustache cream before it's too late.
""Nickname"" - A boy is unhappy on account of his friends have nicknames, but not him.  Luckily, Uncle Grandpa comes to his aid and attempts to earn one by doing some yard work.
""Mystery Noise"" - It's bedtime for Uncle G and pals, but they are suddenly disturbed by a weird sound coming from somewhere in the van.
""Bad Morning"" - Uncle G's acting rather mean lately, and it turns out he got up on the wrong side of bed this morning.  It's up to the others to fix this problem.
""Hide and Seek"" - Uncle Grandpa has never won a game of hide and seek because he never finds everyone in time.
""Vacation"" - Uncle G needs a vacation, but it gets interrupted by a volcanic eruption on the island he's relaxing on.
""Aunt Grandma"" - ""Beautiful morning !""  Looks like Uncle G has some good-looking competition and her name is Aunt Grandma.  And she solves kids' problems more efficiently instead of taking them on crazy adventure.
""Grounded"" - An adolescent kid escapes his room thanks to Uncle Grandpa.  But after feeling bad about it, Uncle G has to get the kid back home and fast.

Like other episodes of the series, you'll also find bonus adventures with his friends Mr. Gus, Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, and also ""New Experiences with Beary Nice and Hot Dog Person"".  And as for you, keep watching Cartoon Network for even more adventures classic and brand-new.  Who knows what kind of mischief you can get into ?",1456704000,,1882,4.508823529411765

6989618,1,B00SJFV74G,"THIS SHOW SUCKS!!!!!!!!! 1997's Batman and Robin is more entertaining than this trash. The animation and art style is like a sword in your sockets. The characters are badly made like giant realistic flying tiger. Not a name but a description. It is not drawn out, it is a picture ripped from GOOGLE IMAGES. I hate it when modern cartoon do that because it is awkward and out of place. Pizza Steve is an annoying pizza slice who only cares about himself. Mr Gus is the only passable character but it is not saying much because he is always so depressed Uncle grandpa is so dumb that he makes patrick star and Homer Simpson look like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. All uncle moron says is good morning. Yeah! Try getting that out of your head!!!!!!!!!!! You may hear it in your dreams!!!!!!! The humor is so gross like a kid making fists from his belly. EWWWW!!!!!!! The morals suck like when he sees a fat kid. Uncle Grandpa says its cool to be fat. WTH!!!!! It is nothing but a REN AND STIMPY RIP OFF!!!!!!!!! The layout is the same and even ripped off some of its skits like Dear Dr. Stupid. Never watch it. Watch ROAD ROVERS or CATDOG instead. My rating is ",1432944000,3,1155,4.372093023255814
