5369089,4,B009V9N1NO,"This is a military drama that takes place in 2004. The National Guard is being called up at unprecedented rates to serve in Iraq. This film looks at one unit in New York getting ready to transfer. No one wants to go to Iraq. Some are able to get out of it. Lt. Sefton (Seth Gabel) because of his powerful family connections, is being transferred to another unit and doesn't have to go. He is helping out as a supply officer. His platoon has harsh feelings in the matter.

Meanwhile Reyes, the corpsman is supposed to stay behind because his son has stage 4 cancer and six months to live. This was denied because he is too good at his job. The platoon helps him go AWOL. Sefton is drawn into the action with mixed allegiances.

What makes this a good film is the stark contrast of Sefton's replacement, Lt. Chambers (Pablo Schreiber). He is all duty having been to Iraq before and injured. He broke up with his girlfriend prior to deployment because it wasn't fair to her. He does not question orders. The film questions duty to family and friends vs. duty to country in a war that wasn't important enough to die for. It does so in a subtle manner.

This is not a war film or action film. It is a well acted thriller/drama.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, no sex or nudity.",1355529600,4,1266,4.374468085106383
5369090,5,B009V9N1NO,"Is it wrong to love this movie because of the HOT men?  Two words: tight shirts.  However, this film is much more than that.  The cast is full of interesting, subtle choices. There's an inter-racial couple and established character actors (including Seth Gable and hip-hop artist Bow-Wow) who handle the dramatic material rather well.  Better than I expected, actually... the film is an effective military thriller, and an intelligent exploration of a part of our society that usually doesn't get the complex character development I found in ALLEGIANCE.  Plus: hot men.  A guilty pleasure, maybe, but one I definitely don't regret. :)",1354924800,2,634,5.166666666666667
8544483,1,B009V9N1NO,"This movie was disturbing, to say the least. I'm sick of all of this sort of propaganda being put out by all of these Marxist Jews in (((Hollywood))). Why on Earth should we, the audience, feel sympathy for two CRIMINALS?",1502150400,,221,4.55

8544488,3,B009V9N1NO,"This film is actually really very good in places. It is set on an army base where units of the National Guard have been called up and are due to be deployed to an Iraqi war zone. Their erstwhile Lieutenant has used his daddy's political clout to get him a cushy transfer so he can stay Stateside with his fianc&eacute;e. Meanwhile the unit's paramedic  (Reyes)- whose young son has terminal cancer - has been told his permission to stay home  has been revoked.

What transpires is the efforts of the guys to do what they think is right in the face of military bureaucratic, indifference. We also have the story of the replacement Lieutenant and some of the back stories of the soldiers involved.

Now I loved the premise and the first third of this film works extremely well. Then we start to get plot holes or contrivances and that is when it starts losing credibility.

May be plot spoiler from here on in!!
When Lt. Sefton runs off to the pay phone as his phone has been confiscated. In the previous scene Sgt Reyes was found by being called on his and phone while hiding in the truck and now he seems to have forgotten it is in his pocket. The security around this military base is a few guys with armbands on; No CCTV at all! I mean really, the protocols for prisoner control were never followed. Some of the fight scenes have all the `blood' put on right at the end and some am dram fisty cuffs at that.

These all occur towards the end and all empathy I had built up started to evaporate, so it went from being really good to ok and then please don't insult my intelligence - I have to say the acting and camera work are mostly good to excellent hence my overall rating.",1430265600,,1677,4.34185303514377
8544489,4,B009V9N1NO,WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.,1405296000,,45,3.6
8544490,3,B009V9N1NO,I really don't like this type of movie where the armed forces are treated like prisoners of war by their officers but if you do then this movie is for you.,1394928000,,155,4.032258064516129
8544491,5,B009V9N1NO,Allegiance is a great film from start to finish.  It has all the elements of suspense besides being an intriguing story.  I recommend this film highly to anyone who enjoys a well developed story line and excellent acting.,1381968000,,221,4.7894736842105265
8544492,5,B009V9N1NO,"The storyline was a good challenge, realistic and full of action.  I recommend the movie to everyone, all ages. The  move showed courage and acting on what one believed was the right thing to do, regardless of the risks.",1369008000,,220,4.615384615384615
