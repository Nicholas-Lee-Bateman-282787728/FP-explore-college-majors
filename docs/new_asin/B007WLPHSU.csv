8522631,2,B007WLPHSU,"Ever since we lost Mel Harvey, they're trying too hard to mention all the characters that aren't on anymore instead of truly developing the ones that they have.  I'm a huge Benidorm fan, but I'll be re-watching Seasons 1, 2 and some of 3 instead.",1382313600,,246,4.466666666666667
