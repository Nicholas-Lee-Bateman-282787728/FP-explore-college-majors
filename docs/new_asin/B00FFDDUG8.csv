8615216,5,B00FFDDUG8,"I just finished working through the DVD for the first time & I am very happy with it! The choreography has allot of playful/flirty moves, it's fun & invigorating, has a touch of samba fusion, & finishes off with one of my fave drum solo moves; the head swing (or as I like to think of it; the cavewoman wild move!).

The DVD uses the same warm-up & cool down as the Istanbul Nights DVD. There's a costume performance at the end of the video. As always, Ansuya is thorough in her explanations & breaks down each combo down to the basic movements so you'll be sure to understand exactly how she means the moves to look & feel, and even if you're fairly new to bellydance you'll still be able to follow along and begin to learn the foundations used in this piece (of course this choreography will be more accessible for those with more experience as it does include allot of shimmy layering).

I'm one of Ansuya's online class students (highly recommended!) & as such I already have access to many choreographies taught by Ansuya from her member's page but I still had to have this DVD in addition because there's just no such thing as too much of a good thing, at least not in bellydance anyway ;). I'm super pleased that I got this & can now learn yet another great choreography by one of the most amazing dance teachers & performers of our time!

BTW, Ansuya, you look awesome in pigtails!
