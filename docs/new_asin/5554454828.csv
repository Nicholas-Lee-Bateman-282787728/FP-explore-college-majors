205041,5,5554454828,"The THX restored widescreen edition of OKLAHOMA! has finally reached us and thank goodness Fox used the TODD-AO original, rather than the tired CinemaScope version as their source.  As noted above in an earlier review,  this is far brighter with more exuberant performances.  The vistas of blue  sky and cloud formations are breathtaking.  Here the main title is  different than the Scope version, coming first, rather than after the  opening cornfield sequence.  There are extended scenes in the runaway  carriage and round-up segments in the TODD-AO version that are not in the  Scope version.  A few 3-D-like effects with a lariat and a mallet here that  are not in the Scope version.  The Overture, Entr'Acte and Exit Music are  all here.  Final Eller scene different in each and Grahame's line  deliveries tend to vary in each; otherwise the two are shot for shot, line  for line almost identical, except for the brightness and joy of the fresh  performances in the TODD-AO version.  Run to buy this one.",922233600,4,1009,4.934131736526946
205042,5,5554454828,"The CinemaScope version (visually dark with no pep whatsoever) was used for general release and video release up until three years ago, when it was retired and a new process was able to convert the TODD-AO version to video.  This is the one that is now available for purchase - and there's a world  of difference.  This is far brighter, with far fresher and more exuberant  performances (remember, that the Scope version was filmed only after the  TODD-AO ""take"" was in the can - of course performers were tired  and the sun had gone in for most of the shots).  A world of difference  between this definitive version and the tired Scope version.  Main Title  is totally different for each version, plus there are a few different scene  set ups, one of two shots in the TODD-AO version not in the Scope version,  and some totally different line deliveries (Ado Annie's ""HELLo,  Will"" in the Scope and her ""heLLO, WILL"" in the TODD-AO.  This is a fine achievement, a classic musical play and a classic film. At  the end of its 2-1/2 hours, your face hurts from smiling.",914371200,6,1067,4.601063829787234

205048,3,5554454828,"THE GOOD
Oklahoma blu-ray is a very special release because it contains two completely different versions. And I don't mean an extended cut, one version was shot in 35mm Cinemascope and the other was shot in 70mm Todd-AO. Each version contains different performances and establishing shots. While the 70mm version looks great, it was shot at 30 frames per second and creates the motion blur effect (not that most TVs don't). This is a rare case where I consider the 35mm version instead of 70mm.

Truthfully, this movie isn't my cup of tea but I found it enjoyable. The songs are well composed and surprisingly dirty. This also contains a song that is so bad it's good, ""I Cain't Say No"". It it amazingly bad.

THE BAD
I'm not a fan of clean cut American westerns and this film is way too wholesome. I get it, it's supposed to be an over the top stage play, it's just not for me.

THE UGLY
Truthfully this film is very tame (even with the constant sexual innuendos) and doesn't really do anything particularly horrible. I get why this has a fanbase, it's a sweet little wholesome musical and if that's for you, enjoy this!",1520726400,,1122,4.544554455445544

For me, this is Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest work, an absolute paean to America. Every moment of this film is made with perfection and to see this in blu-ray is a wonder to behold, almost like seeing it for the first time in the limited ToddAO release. The images that fill the frame are sumptuous, the sound is glorious. All the actors fulfill their roles to perfection with Shirley Jones and Gloria Grahame as true stand outs. So many, many great songs and dance pieces, but try not to shed a tear of joy while watching Many a New Day- the beauty of the tune, of Agnes de Mille's choreography, of the dancers, of Shirley Jones' voice and most amazingly, Oscar Hammerstein's lyrical poetry. This film is a masterpiece.",1516320000,2,848,4.5855263157894735

205083,5,5554454828,"Boy was I surprised! I did not think this 1939 85-minute black and white film with James Cagney in the main role, Humphrey Bogart in second place, and Ward Bond down the line a way would be any good. I did not think that Cagney and Bogart could play western outlaws, but they did; and Cagney was perfect. He was almost always smiling and despite committing crimes for most of the film, he was very likable. Bogart wore black as one would expect from a 1939 villain, and had curly hair, which also surprised me.
It is 1893 in the film. Oklahoma was just stolen from the Indians and settlers rushed to build there. Tulsa was started and soon there was gambling, robberies, and killings there all run by Bogart. Good citizens wanted to stop him but could not do it. Cagney was outside of the town, wanted by the law, with a $500 reward on his head. His father was one of the people who tried to overcome Bogart, and Bogart and his gang killed Cagney's father. It was then that Cagney looked for revenge and went straight.",1501545600,,1018,4.391534391534392

I first saw this film on a crappy television in the late 1950's
Then on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD
Through all those years I always felt that there was a pristine movie hiding under all of those horrible format releases.

I saw this movie back in the fifties at the Brisbane Regent Theatre and the Burleigh Heads DeLuxe Theatre.(Australia)..but now we have as well as the Cinemascope version...a 70 mm version with 30 fps...so no picture flicker...no distortion...and the sound is 7 channels of excellence...4 discs in the set for just over 20 USD....2 discs are BluRay and two are normal DVD's. We have already viewed the first half of the 70 mm roadshow version....it is longer than the Cinemascope version having an Overture and interval / entracte...and hopefully a play out. The discs arrived in Portugal from the US via normal Postal delivery within 1 week of ordering from the US with no customs inspection and no extra taxes.

205216,5,5554454828,"One of the few great movie musicals taken from a big Broadway hit. Zinneman does a wonderful job of pushing the story out onto real prairie. Every song works, and both principals are blessed with lovely voices. My favorite number, is the Gene Nelson ""Everything's up to Date in Kansas City."" As perfect a song-dance performance as you'll ever see.  Too bad that the other Macrae-Jones big Broadway hit, Carousel just doesn't get off the ground. And even worse in the category of Rogers and Hammerstein monster hits stage-to-film  is the mess they made of  South Pacific. Those ghastly gels over what is gorgeous scenery. And only one chorus of ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair  ??? Geez, Mitzi Gaynor was perfect for the Nellie Forbush role. So sorry they didn't make the most of her talent. But Oklahoma gets it right. By the way if you like this version you might be interested the filmed London stage performance which stars Hugh Jackman as Curly.  He's really great. Totally different from Gordon Macrae, but really special and he even looks more like a rangy  cowpoke.  Wish he'd done more movie musicals. I know he's in Les Miserables, but his voice sounds slightly pinched in ""Bring Him Home.""",1473379200,2,1213,4.720379146919432

The colors are stunning, music is so much better now with the 7.1 channels. Also having a digital copy was a big plus and a major reason I bought this set. This set has 2 Blu-ray disks and 2 DVDs. Each pair has the updated Todd-AO & theatrical releases. I haven't seen the theatrical version yet.
Of course, the movie itself doesn't need any reviewing. It's been done many times. I saw this when it was originally released. My parents always took my brother & I to see R&H musicals either as a play or at the movies. I love this movie, always enjoying Shirley Jones' beautiful singing. And Gordon MacRae's too. Years later I always thought how strange it was seeing Rod Steiger singing as I never thought of him as being a singer.

205275,5,5554454828,"Many of the reviews of this Blu Ray/DVD/Digital HD have been based on the DVD version. I haven't seen the DVD versions, but I am watching the Todd-AO widescreen Blu Ray version. The remastering is absolutely stunning! Todd AO was a sort of precursor to 3D. It was filmed with a special super wide-angle lens that was designed to show on a curved screen. The result was, among other things, a superior picture to ordinary Cinemascope (which it was also filmed in). Cinemascope images were wide, but not very tall. Watching the Todd-AO version on a widescreen TV, you notice that the ""black bars"" at the top and bottom of the TV are smaller; in other words, the picture is ""taller."" Though it was designed for a curved screen, the image on an ordinary LCD TV (46"" in my case) shows no more distortion than the typical widescreen movie filmed today.
In terms of sharpness, overall quality, graininess: the picture is stunning! no artifacts, graininess! Super sharp. I set my BR player to the sharpest picture setting, and the picture is absolutely perfect. It looks as though it had been filmed yesterday. I highly recommend paying a few more bucks and getting the Blu Ray set over just the DVD set. I haven't seen the DVD versions in this 4-disc set, so I can't comment on that. There is a second Blu Ray disc with the Cinemascope version, which is the one the vast majority of us are familiar with. (The Todd-AO has some scenes designed especially for the process, including the opening scene, with the camera moving between rows of corn, to highlight the semi-3D effect of the Todd-AO process; one example). Highly recommended.",1460073600,5,1627,4.712280701754386

On the DVD version, the opening scene of Gordon McRae riding through the corn field was severely blurred.  On the present Blu Ray,  it is pristinely clear.  The remainder of the movie is clearly improved, as well, with gorgeously saturated and sharp imagery.  The fine sound track quality was retained.

The reviewer also  indicated that the accompanying Cinemascope version was not as good as the DVD,  but I did not mind that, as I wanted the Todd AO version.

This may be the closest the current generation will ever experience the clarity of the Todd-AO lenses.  So few theatres were equipped with the 70mm projectors needed, the new lenses, the new deep curved screen & 6 channel sound that only a relatively small number of Americans saw Oklahoma! in Todd-AO.  It was later released in a Cinemascope version filmed with 35mm cameras.  That is what most people have seen on DVD up to now.  If you are the owner of a really big screen TV or can project the Blu-ray, this version merits a purchase.

205299,5,5554454828,This is a magnificent release of the film in all its Todd AO presentation. The Cinemascope version is also not bad albeit that its the Todd AO version that steals the show ( scenes were filmed with a Todd AO camera and then the actors would have to repeat the scene for the benefit of a Cinemascope lens). Most people only saw the latter version as not many cinemas in 1955 had the necessary projector to show the former. It would be too easy to believe that the film was made this year such is the quality of the print. Previous releases on DVD and Lazer Disc were faulty in the sense that mistakes were made when transcribing onto those platforms. The result was a fuzzy and totally unsatisfactory print in Todd AO and not particularly good in the Cinemascope edition. All is forgiven. See this film now and appreciate a type of movie genre that would appear to be long forgotten with melodies and dialogue that we rarely get the opportunity to see in todays offerings.,1454630400,2,971,4.491525423728813

205319,5,5554454828,"I saw Oklahoma in Todd-AO on the big screen in the mid 1950s when it premiered. For home theater, over the years I bought the VHS prints, then the 2-disc 50th Anniversary DVD. that Fox marketed in 2005. The latter contains both the Todd-AO and CinemaScope prints in standard definition and dolby digital multiple channel sound. It is very good. However, that is now surpassed by Fox's 2014 release of the two original separate filmings (Todd-AO & CinemaScope) on Blu Ray video and DTS (Digital Theater Sound) multiple channel audio. Both the 50th Anniversary 2-disc DVD set and this 2014 4-disc BD/DVD set have identical bonus features of many hours. On my 16X9 HD Samsung 55"" TV the Todd-AO Blu Ray was simply spectacular in video clarity and color and the sound is the best I have yet heard for Oklahoma in home theater. As explained in a featurette carried over from the 50th Anniversary edition, Todd-AO & CinemaScope are both widescreen (enhanced for 16X9 TVs) but Todd-AO has a taller image than CinemaScope (2.20 vs. 2.55).  If you own a large 16X9 HD TV, this height difference is significant for enjoying Oklahoma as near to the original Todd-AO experience of the 1950s that is currently possible for home theater. I personally do not need anything better than this in picture and sound. quality. I highly recommend the Blu Ray of the Todd-AO disc in this set. It alone is worth the price. This 2014 4-disc set includes HD Blu Ray discs of both the Todd-AO & Cinemascope original separate filmings (slight differences as each was shot separately) and SD DVD discs in Todd-AO & CinemaScope. If you are reading this you already know the content of this R & H American musical, made great entertainment on film by the singing and dancing of Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones, Gene Nelson, Charlotte Greenwood, Gloria Graham, and Rod Steiger with Eddie Albert for

205322,5,5554454828,"60 years on, this musical, based on the 1943 Broadway hit with music by Rodgers and Hammerstein is still an upbeat delight.
I have memories of this airing on CBS back in the 70s, but as I was very young, I didn't really appreciate it or understand its storyline.
 By 1980, there was some televised commemoration of the film's 25th anniversary with commentary by star, Shirley Jones, who made her film debut  as the heroine, Laurey. One got a sense of the joyousness Jones had in undertaking the task, and made wish I'd been around to experience that.
 As the 80s continued, and I was living the the big state south of Oklahoma, I developed a considerable appreciation for they way it captured the atmosphere of the dusty rural Midwest and Southwest.
  Set in early 1900s  pre-statehood Oklahoma Territory, we are greeted with a view of the story's hero, Curly, portrayed by the incomparable Gordon MacRae as he rides through a cornfield en route to see  young Laurey Williams, who resides at the farm of her Aunt Eller(Charlotte Greenwood), and invite her to be his date at an upcoming box social. The very witty and perceptive Aunt Eller can see the sparks between Curly and her niece. But Laurey's snide remarks result in Curly's withdrawal of the invitation, and and overly prideful Laurey inviting her aunt's dubious farmhand, Jud Fry(a sinister Rod Steiger) instead.
  Curly invites a rather dimwitted girl named Gertie( Barbara Lawrence) to the box social instead.
 In the meantime, the locals are diverted by return of cowboy, Will Parker(Gene Nelson) from Kansas City, Missouri. Destined for a romance of his own , Will gives those gathered to welcome him at the train station that ""Everything's Up-to-Date in Kansas City"", leading most of those present in a lively dance routine.
 Curly has a snide confrontation with Jud Fry before the big event in the farmhand's grim and unkempt living quarters.
 Ado Annie, (Gloria Grahame), Laurey's friend, with a reputation for being a shameless flirt discourses on her reputation with the song, ""I'm Just a Gal Who Can't Say No"", and is intrigued by a fraudulent traveling  peddler going by the name, Ali Hakim (the delightful, pre-""Green Acres"" era Eddie Albert, with whom I had a chance encounter as a child in the late 70s).
  While girls headed for the box social stop at Laurey's house to change and freshen up for the event, there is a lovely, graceful, and occasionally comical moment( prominently featuring ""Brigadoon's"" Virginia Bosler) during which Laurey encourages her guests not to spend too much time lamenting a lost love and to be resilient via the song, ""Many a New Moon"". But we shall see that she has trouble following her own advice.
  She tries the Elixir of Egypt given to her by Ali Hakim, and falls asleep in a rocking chair where she has a dream--which turns into a very bad one--about what her life with Jud would be like if she married him, which does give Ali Hakim at least some credibility.
  Laurey's decision to ditch Jud en route to the party leads to a more hazardous turn of events.
  To the song, ""Territory Folks"", Eller has to maintain order when bickering between cowboys and farmers threatened to ruin the square dance.
 In the face of Jud's threats, Curly purposes to Laurey amid the beauteous strains of ""Let People Say We're in Love"".
 But even their wedding day is threatened by Jud's villainy.
  James Whitmore's Mr. Carnes, Jay C. Flippen's Skidmore, ""Oklahoma's"" original Broadway cast member Bambi Linn as Dream Laurey and James Mitchell's Dream Curly help round out the cast as those involved receive their romantic rewards to a classic score whose titular song is now Oklahoma's State Song, and  to a fabled ride in a surrey with fringe on top, we witness a glorious and triumphant finale under silver-lined clouds.--A beautiful morning, and a beautiful day, indeed!",1451433600,,3866,4.8551829268292686

205325,5,5554454828,"Of the film adaptations of the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musicals, three stand out : ""Oklahoma', 'The King and I' and 'the Sound of Music'. By far the most famous and successful(in terms of box office) is 'The Sound of Music'. That film is beautifully produced and its Oscar wins attest to the fact that many moviegoers through the decades hold the film close to their hearts. ""The King and I' was a big hit in 1956-57 and rightly so. A faithful rendering of the Broadway production, it lavishly recreated the sets and costumes of the stage production and preserved on film the iconic performance of Yul Brynner's King of Siam, ably abetted by the wonderful Deborah Kerr. However, if one movie deserves to stand equally tall next to ""The Sound of Music', then ""Oklahoma', which premiered in 1955, matches 'Music' in every department. As with 'Music', the film was lensed in the then new widescreen TODD-AO, the process that showcased the movie in its initial Road Show engagements. An alternative to the much ballyhooed CINERAMA, TODD-AO managed to project a movie on 70mm film onto a huge, deeply curved screen that nearly matched the dimensions of CINERAMA but used one projector instead of  the three required for the latter presentation.

""Oklahoma' benefitted greatly from this new process. The Todd-AO screen was perfect for this spectacular production, a meticulously faithful rendering of the landmark Broadway musical. Stunningly photographed, brilliantly orchestrated and beautifully acted, ""Oklahoma' deserves to be recognized as one of the all time great film musicals. The recent Blu-ray edition sports a magnificent transfer to Blu-ray of the TODD-AO presentation, which showed up on the previous DVD release as a washed-out, murky- looking image. The new Blu-ray/DVD combo package also features the Wide release CINEMASCOPE VERSION of the film (The movie was shot twice to accommodate theaters for general release showings). The two versions have differences in camera set-ups and blocking of actors that make for a fascinating couple of viewing experiences. While the CINEMASCOPE version is very nice, the TODD-AO production is the definitive ""Oklahoma' on film, boasting spectacular image and sound.

Aside from its TODD-AO trappings, ""Oklahoma' has a cast to die for. Gordon McCrea is an ideally cast Curly, the handsome cowboy in love with the beautiful Laurey (Shirley Jones). McCrea and Jones sing with their real voices, and they are glorious. The supporting cast couldn't be better, but standouts include Charlotte Grenwood's Aunt Eller,Eddie Albert's Ali Hakim, Gene Nelson's Will Parker and Rod Steiger's powerfully moody Jud Fry. Agnes DeMille's choreography is reproduced on film to brilliant effect. The dance sequences for 'Everything's Up to Date in Kansas City' and 'The Farmer and the Cowman' merit legendary status, as does the lengthy 'Dream Ballet' danced by stand-ins for Curley, Laurey and Jud that ends the first half of the film before intermission.

""Oklahoma!' is a classic film.",1450483200,2,3024,5.267634854771784

205442,5,5554454828,"Though today's audiences might consider this a dusty relic, in its day it was virtually revolutionary - not only was ballet integral to a Broadway show - a shocker to audiences of the time - but, more significantly, the songs were embedded in the action and served to further the plot.  This musical changed forever the way such shows were written.

Still, the musical opened on Broadway over 70 years ago, and so you can't fault those caught in the maelstrom of the ever-sprinting zeitgeist, for whom last year's hot musical is already hopelessly passe, for relegating Oklahoma to the cultural equivalent of their great-grandmother's attic.

But one thing pop culture never acknowledges is that quality is timeless, and the movie, made a long 12 years after the play premiered, retains the original's magic quality; indeed, it has aged remarkably well in the years since.  It is a gorgeous piece of filmmaking and a joyous dip in the refreshing pool of unabashed Americana, with innovative camera work, a sumptuous palette of color, iconic performances all around and a ballet-within-the-musical that is so evocative and satisfying that, even if you're not a particular fan of ballet, will mesmerize you with its lush expressiveness and the scope of its rendering of the totality of the human condition - our aspirations, our fears and, especially, the evil that tends to brush up, however fleetingly, against even the sunniest of lives.

The ballet is essentially a restatement of the arc of the play writ in dance, and a lovely arc it is.

I won't get into the plot here, but I will say that the performances are all outstanding; it was Shirley Jones's first movie, and it rightfully made her a star.  She is lovely and strikes just the right tone as the skittish Laurey, who badly wants to marry Curley, but whose games of hard-to-get almost get out of hand.

Gordon McRae is excellent as well - yes, there might be more dynamic actors out there, but none who can sing as well as he, or who can do it while exuding unbridled, unapologetic alpha-male charisma as he.

Gloria Grahame is one of my favorite female film actors of all time, and she almost steals the entire movie as the would-be trollop Ado Annie, whose sexual appetite is somewhat tempered with her essential innocence.

Eddie Albert, another underrated actor who often spun pure gold, is a wonderful comic counterpoint to the dark Rod Steiger as Jud.  I'm sure many think Steiger was too leaden or hammy as Jud, but he succeeds marvelously in making your skin crawl.

And no, nobody's ever going to mistake Eddie Albert's Ali Hakim for a real Persian, but who cares?

Charlotte Greenwood as Aunt Eller is a wonderful presence throughout the film - she may be one of the ""old folks,"" but the light behind her eyes and her physical vitality are a joy; she is, in fact, the sun around which all of the other characters orbit.

Gene Nelson's rendition of Kansas City - along with the wonderful staging and use of the chorus - is as good as any dance number ever caught on film - and I'm a huge Fred Astaire/Gene Kelly fan.  So I don't say that lightly.

The rest of the cast is appropriately homespun and distinctive.

The plot is quite simple - it all revolves around the box social dance that's going to occur that night, and the love machinations that ensue as folks attempt to pair off.

This movie is, quite simply, a delight.  If you can transport yourself to a simpler time (when sentimentality wasn't an embarrassment and irony wasn't the oxygen that pop culture breathes), you will be richly rewarded.",1435449600,11,3574,4.726247987117552

205496,3,5554454828,"I love this film and the Tod AO transfer is incredible on modern screens.  The extras are flawless on the version as well with Shirley Jones shining when talking about her works and how it began her screen touch as Aunt Eller's niece.  She mentions that she and one other major cast member are all that are left from the actors in the film along with a few of the dancers as she and the director take you to a lovely little place where it was shot on location.  I had to give this a three though as it seems those who have commentaries on disc two with the cinematic blu ray take it from a Rodgers and Hammerstein look totally blow it by not listening to Jones' and her counterpart on the first Blu ray.  Simply put in my mind if they couldn't correctly answer some of the issues spoken about on that disc then they should have had the moxie to tell us something like Shirley Jones' recollection was...they didn't and it makes them seem to be irreparable when it comes to the knowledge of this classic!  Other gems (Spoiler alert ahead) speak of  Ado Annie who was originally played in the theater by Celeste Holm.  I don't know when the cinematic voice tracks were done but one of the gentlemen on disc two of the blu ray commentaries made me smile as I remember Celeste from tv shows like Promised Land.  Celeste passed on in New York in July of 2012 but the commentator mentions that as of his recording, she could still do a hearty and superb version of I'm Just A Girl Who Cain't Say No! a few months before as well as she did when she lit it up with the stage version.  I'd love to hear that and a stage version and film version copy of the cast recordings would have been wonderful additions to this superb set sans the error of the second set of commentators who were far from the experts they claimed to be.  If you know and love the musical and have only one blu ray version to choose I'd get the TodAO version which will full screen on 32"" LED TVs and share the joy the heart and voice brings as Shirley Jones' beautiful blending of past and present make that disc a full 5 stars with all the extras it includes over the bile tasting second blu ray commentaries which sadly take the whole set down to a three.  I might suggest that those in the family of the great library of the proud traditions of Rodgers and Hammerstein look for curators who are wise enough to listen before they speak.  Take another bow Ms. Shirley Jones!  Brava and can't wait for the encore in Carousel ;)",1424476800,,2490,4.272340425531915

Having said that...

This Blu-ray is the FINEST print I have ever seen; (TODD-AO version).  I don't even like to use the word, ""print"" as there is no film grain, no dirt, no scratches...it is like looking through a pane of glass!  You can see bugs fly by and see details in the background a half mile away.  After taking in this visual feast, I looked at a DVD for comparison and was HORRIFIED by how crappy it looked.  If you have a Blu-ray player and enjoy this film, this is the version to have!  The other version of the film is included on Blu-ray as well, and looks better than the DVD, but is no match for the Todd-AO version; still it is worth seeing for the alternate performances.",1422921600,14,961,4.3

The Todd Ao print was great and the CinemaScope print was very colorful. What disappointed  me was tha fox did not present the Todd AO print in smilebox to show how it was shown,This made the shorts not very affective because it was flat .My guess was tha the Murdoch studio did not like smile box .Yet they show it demonstrating some of the todd AO Scenes with the CinemaScope scenes from this feature  in the documentary .In spite of this the musical was  overwhelming it was good any way. the Blu- ray discs was very sharp and crisp on both prints. On the CinemaScope version,For some reason they eliminated the intermission ,overture and exit music for some reason I believe the CinemaScope was treated the same way as road show 70mm version. Many theaters couldn't afford Todd AO.I,There was an excerpt form a 1954 t.v.  broad cast special starring Gordon MacRae and a young Florence Henderson singing some of the songs from the broad way musical. All this makes up for lack of smile box .As of 02/02/15 I checked the DVD version out,thank got I did not throw my old one away. It was horrible .The print was muddy and not  sharp. It look like a video tape dupe. Why did fox did not fix it for the DVD .Why only Bu-ray? Where did fox get the elements for the  Blu-Ray? They should have used this for the DVD too. This is typical of Murdoch studios. The home of right wing news. Well I just Won't play that version. I think they are trying to get people ,who have no blur ray player yet, to buy a blu ray player by showing how bad the DVD is,corporate Fascist. This is my viewpoint. As of 02/02/15 I checked my old 1996 discs and it was also not very sharp neither. This is the element that Fox used for the DVD.Why didn't fox used the same new elements ,that they used on the Blu-ray, for DVD too? instead of an old 1998 DVD master",1422748800,,2231,4.3031026252983295

205508,3,5554454828,"So disappointed about the audio for the Todd version.  The video is gorgeous, but the audio is really jacked up.  You notice it right away in the opening scenes.  All the vocal dialogue is extremely subdued compared to the music all through the feature.  And no, it's not my speaker system.  The Todd DVD doesn't have this problem, but then again, the video can't compare at all... no where close.  Now, the Bluray Cinemascope version is only just a little bit better than it's DVD counterpart with an awful lot of grain throughout the video.  This would have been a really great video to have if not for the just plain awful audio soundtrack in the Todd version.  It ruined it for me having to try to readjust all my speaker settings just for this feature alone, which still didn't solve the problem.  And believe me, if you don't, you won't hear most of the dialogue.  I give the Bluray Todd version video a very strong 5 stars, but it's audio soundtrack a very disappointing one star.

205521,5,5554454828,"R&H finally got it right with the TODD-AO release of Oklahoma on Blu-ray/DVD.  Each version of the film, TODD-AO 148 min  Widescreen 2.20:1 and Cinescope 140 min Widescreen 2.55:1 has a corresponding Blu-ray disc and DVD disc dedicated to it.  (4 discs in total + and Ultraviolet/HD digital download for your tablet or PC).  Special documentary on Cinescope and Todd-AO is very enlightening on differences between the two versions.  My main reason for obtaining Blu-ray was the improved Todd-AO transfer and DTS HD 7.1 uncompressed audio soundtrack.  The original Todd-AO 70 mm film also shows a taller picture than the Cinemascope derived from 35 mm print.  The Todd-AO also had 6 tracks of sound which have been used to create the new 7.1 soundtrack and the Cinemascope had 3 tracks of sound on the print which has enabled a DTS-master HD audio 4.0 sound track.  (But do not be deceived. The 7.1 is the only one worth listening to).
  MOST IMPORTANT THING:  TODD-AO remaster.  The transfer to Blu-ray is spectacular.  The details captured are jaw-dropping.  The picture has been converted to true anamorphic filling 16:9 TV screens perfectly.  Ben-Hur, Sound of Music, and Wizard of OZ are some comparable blu-ray releases that compare well with TODD-AO (BLU-RAY version) of OKLAHOMA!
  NEXT MOST IMPORTANT:  The 7.1 DTS uncompressed sound.  Gordan McRae and Shirley Jones never sounded so good  together.  The overture, Intermission, ent'racte, and End Music all are superb.

  CINEMASCOPE version:  A big disappointment.  While there are many fans of this version, the picture looks dull and lifeless on blu-ray.  The picture of the Blu-ray looks similar to the old dvd version, very grainy and lacking details. The one positive is the colors and clothing textures seem more vivid than TODD-AO version.  However, the 24 fps in which it was filmed doesn't come close to touching the 30 FPS which the Todd-AO version touts.  The Todd-AO version is much smoother and crystal clear.  To put the debate out of sight, consider that the Cinemascope DTS 4.0 master audio sounds horrible when compared to the new 7.1 DTS audio on the TODD-AO blu-ray which really shines and feels so alive and visceral.  For a film which won an Academy Award for Best Sound Recording and Best Scoring of a Musical Picture, you really owe it to yourself to hear it as it was originally recorded.  Get this blu-ray!

Other notes:
While some of the scenes were filmed from a different angle due to the two types of cameras used, many of the scenes were re-filmed in their entirety for the two different formats (Todd-AO and Cinemascope).  This makes each film a unique creation.  For example: one particular difference is when Aunt Eller and the ensemble sing 'The Farmer and the Cowman should be friends.'  In the Todd-AO version, Eller declares, ""...I'll be damned if I ain't just as good."" (With the rest of the cast repeating the same refrain.  While in the Cinemascope picture Eller demures, ""I'll be danged if I ain't just as good"".  ""I say that I'm no better than anybody else, but I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!"" the chorus  replies.  There are many more subtle differences but I'll leave those to you to discover.

205531,2,5554454828,"In the DVD version there is a segment entitled Todd AO vs CinemaScope. They show why they had to film two separate versions... Todd AO was filmed at 30 fps and conventional 35mm was shot at 24 fps. Making the 70mm version incompatible for reduction to 35 mm for general release. In the documentary they demonstrated why Mike Todd developed this 70 mm process. Mike Todd had been a part of the first Cinerama production. His son Mike Todd Jr produced the famous roller coaster sequence. Mike Todd Sr later sold his interest in Cinerama and sought to develope a process that replicated Cinerama but did not require the use of three cameras/projectors thereby eliminating the join lines for a seamless picture. He approached American Optical and asked if they could come
up with a lens to have Cinerama out of one hole and they said yes. Todd AO was the end result. They could use a variety of lenses for long, medium and close shots, something Cinerama could not do because of the inflexibility of the camera. Todd AO used a 120 degree bug eye lens to capture a picture close to what Cinerama did but without those ""damn lines"" as one person is quoted as saying in the documentary. Mike Todd had to use a curved screen with  120 degree curve. Correct me if I am wrong but Cinerama had a patent on their 146 degree curved louvered screen. The documentary uses SmileBox curved screen simulation to show you, the viewer, what audiences experienced with the theatrical release of Oklahoma. My biggest complaint is not only why the 70mm print is not restored to look as it did originally but why not release it with the option to watch it as Mike Todd intended with the SmileBox simulated curved screen effect? The documentary shows us what it looked like with the curved screen simulation and it is impressive. David Strohmaier who has spearheaded restoration and preservation of the original 3 strip Cinerama travelogues uses SmileBox to replicate what audiences of the 1950's saw in the theater. David Stromaier reconstructed Mike Todd jr's Scent of Mystery filmed in Todd 70 and later coverted to 3 strip Cinerama as Holiday in Spain, using original 65mm negatives and 70mm prints to release it in SmileBox as a ""Cinerama"" film with the permission of Mike Todd jr's family. It is on blu ray and looks great considering the source material they had to work with. David Strohmaier is also working on the home video release of The Golden Head filmed in Technirama and MCS 70 which was released as a ""Cinerama"" film. It too is getting the SmileBox treatment preserving what audiences saw in 1964. Why release Oklahoma in a ""flat"" format when the point of it's release was to compete with Cinerama?? It is similar to what started in the 1980's with the colorization of black and white films. These were not intended to be shown in color. After Mike Todd's death all Todd AO films starting with South Pacific were shot at 24fps and projected on a flat screen. This departure totally ruined the original purpose of Todd AO to replicate Cinerama. Several theaters still used the curved screen into the 1960's. Toledo, Ohio had a single lens Cinerama theater set up in 1964 after the 3 strip Cinerama theater closed in 1963. They brought the giant Cinerama screen out of mothballs in 1973 and showed many 70mm films released as Cinerama films as well as Todd AO films one of which was Hello Dolly which looked spectacular on the giant Cinerama screen. It was like I Max...only better in my opinion. I Max is just BIG. It does not use a curved screen to replicate what we see peripherally. That would make I Max even more of a visceral experience. Just my opinion. Do not misunderstand me...I enjoy watching a good movie in black and white with a 1.33 to 1 aspect ratio. High Noon filmed in 1952 in b&w and the old 1.33 to 1 ratio...the same year Cinerama blasted onto the screen. I never tire of watching it. Why do these film studios invite us to a steak dinner only to find out it's a hamburger with french fries...and cold at that. If they are going to the expense of releasing a restoration of a film then for crying out loud release it as audiences saw it in it's original release! Failing to do so is like saying that showing Todd AO on a curved screen as Mike Todd intended never happened. They are in effect rewriting history and blotting out an extremely important part of film history denying a whole new generation to learn how the wide screen revolution of the 1950's changed the way we see films today. Similar films that lack the full theatrical treatment include It' A Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Around the World In 80 Days, Grand Prix, 2001 A Space Odyssey and many many others. With flat screen televisions getting larger with higher definition and now utilizing curved screens SmileBox curved screen simulation allows us to get the feel of what it was like to watch a movie on a giant curved screen. To summarize, Mike Todd's Oklahoma used the catch phrase ""You're In The Show With Todd AO"" in their advertising. David Strohmaier, who is spearheading restoration of the early 3 strip Cinerama films says that this and Around the World In Eighty Days should br restored and made available in flat and SmileBox format to preserve the way Mike Todd wanted the film to be seen.",1418428800,,5275,4.6236673773987205

The film shows one thing, ""Oklahoma"" was not intended as a film show. The concept behind: Broadway can't be everywhere in the world. So we need a simulation process to bring Broadway to all remote places in the world. The process was the wide gauge film with Stereo magnetic tracks, which offered a true copy of the Broadway play when shown in properly designed theatres.
The enclosed Cinemascope version is interesting to watch, but sucks. The sound is way inferior, the picture different and without the effect of ""3D without glasses"".

When this film was shot they had to do each scene twice: once for the Cinemascope cameras and again for Todd-AO.  I compared scenes between this DVD and my Cinemascope DVD, and this is indeed the Todd-AO version. One of the reasons Todd-AO is superior to Cinemascope is because it was shot at 30 frames per second instead of the standard 24.

The thing is that I live in Europe and by all the laws of a region locked Hollywood my simple player should have rejected this disc as it still does for example with my region A version of ""Bigger Than Life"". Given that I have always loved this movie (and was frustrated in having to make do with the CinemaScope version in the cinema when it was first released because very few cinemas were equipped to screen the larger process) this was a particulaly exciting surprise for me, since there is no news yet of it - or the other Rodgers and Hammerstein films in this set- coming out here in good old Region B land.
And what a truly beautiful sight this is! Really breathtaking. Whatever the faults with the original Dvd this new blu ray restoration more than makes up for them. In fact it is a bit too good. My son who is currently working on his own feature film was quick to point out that the picture was a bit too sharp with white lines around characters. On the other hand I was equally surprised when he demonstrated how comparitively dark the movie looked when projected in cinemas due to the weak lamps used by most projectors back in the day. Luckily, some colour correction on his part has produced a perfect print for me.
Certainly this version is the one to watch with the cast still fresh and the image filling virtually all of my screen. One has to wonder though why Gloria Grahame was not dubbed; her singing is SO off-key that it must have made Shirley Jone's toes curl!
One last point; before going all mad at Fox for their previous mistake(s) with the DVD Todd A-O version of this film please remember this was not one of this studio's movies to begin with being produced by the Desilu Company ( formerly RKO) The honour for the first Fox- R&H collaboration seems to go to  ""Carousel"" (which also had two versions)

With that said,  the film as a film has some terrific moments but also some glaring problems;  the good news is the casting is great,  singing superb and acting especially by Rod Steiger and Charlotte Greenwood are fine.  My major complaint is the unimaginative way some of the numbers were filmed;  especially the title song.  Most of the time half of the cast in the number is not in the picture,  quite a shame since it is a huge wide screen format.  The title song is by all means a proscenium number and the director should have taken advantage of the wide screen format instead of clumping everyone in front of the house.  Also, the solos and duets are draggy because of lack of movement by the camera and/or the actors.

It's not the whole film, but quite a large chunk of it. It's especially noticeable in the ""Farmer and the Cowman"" number.
  Also, it's a big rip-off that the regular DVD in the set is NOT the restored version. It appears to be the same quality as the late 90's version, perhaps the same used for the previous laser-disc.

205555,5,5554454828,"At long last, the restored Todd-AO version of this great Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, OKLAHOMA!!! on Blue Ray AND it looks fantastic!!

After a number of attempts of this Todd- AO version from VHS (reasonable quality) to DVD (ARRRGGGHHH!!!! WHAT WENT WRONG????) to finally the one we have been waiting for!!!

Best viewed on the biggest screen you can get, mine's an 8ft wide screen with Benq Projector (4 billion pixels) and obviously a 4K print, this just leaps off the screen. With it's very impressive opening with Overture (the word is small against a black screen) then into the knockout opening credits (barely legible in earlier incantations) and first actual scene in the cornfield who could ask for anything more? It must have been very impressive to original audiences!!

The wonderful voices of Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones (you can understand every word they sing!) send all the songs to the height of an elephant's eye.....

This film was actually produced by Rodgers and Hammerstein and what a great job they did. It's just a pity they didn't seem to have a real hands on for their other stage to films. One wonders what a full version of the King and I would have been like. But they were more interested in the stage.

Two interesting little differences between this and the scope version. In the auction scene, Charlotte Greenwood brings down the auction hammer so hard, the head breaks off and flies straight into the camera lens(!), the actors seem to groan (watch Jay C Flippen in the scene as though he is thinking, retake!!) But to Charlotte Greenwoods professionalism and credit, carries on with the scene, so it's left in the Todd-AO version.

The other difference is the ending. In the scope version where they ride off into the sunset and camera rises, a fly lands on the lens and there's a bodgy job to cover it up. In the Todd-AO version there is no fly and ends smoothly.

Run the DTS 7.1 through your amp system (though just as good on 5.1) and make sure it's good and loud to hear every wonderful note.

4K resolution and great colour restoration. If you're alert enough, you'll spot a travelling car in the distant background. Seen the film heaps of times but never the car which shows just how good the detail is!!

The 2nd version, the CinemaScope 55 version is... well, quite ordinary. Grainy, a standard opening with credits.... and well, it just ain't the same despite everyone being just as good as in the Todd-AO version. An example of difference is the first shot of the Claymore Station where they pan from the carriage with Charlotte Greenwood arriving to across to the train coming in (yes, pan even in CinemaScope!!) The Todd-AO version sees it all in the one shot!

One of the featurettes uses the SmileBox format with it's OKLAHOMA! samples... so who knows it may get done in that next....!!

Still though this is one we have been waiting for and now at last it is here. Enjoy one and all.",1413158400,25,2943,4.673114119922631

205577,3,5554454828,"The comments from the professionals explaining why the Todd-AO version of Okahoma is pretty much unrestorable, sadly may well be true, but let's be clear on one thing. I co-screened this film in that process (we had to have dual projectionists to help lift the enormous reels of film) and the process was astonishing. I'm not imagining that it wasn't as good as I remember. It really was. I'm older, but I'm not senile. And the comment that the Todd-AO print is good on this dvd is just nonsense. Has anyone seen the breathtaking Bluray of South Pacific? Well, that's what the Bluray of Oklahoma should look like. If we ever get it. Spectacular. I screened that as well for nearly two years in the Roadshow version. Same cinema. Fantastic. The problem is that you really would have to be in your mid sixties to remember what Todd-AO actually looked like it. It was an amazing process. The real problem was that unless the cinema was screening a Todd-AO film, the deeply curved screen made other films in 35mm distort. So they flattened the curve. And when they did that, what you had was just another great 70mm process, but it didn't have the enveloping 3D feel of the original. I wish all you buffs could have been there. It would have knocked your socks off. Check out the Widescreen Museum website. It's very informative.",1407801600,,1325,4.642553191489362

205592,4,5554454828,"NOTE: This review is based on the 1999 single-disc nonanamorphic DVD, which is the version of the movie I saw.

On both stage and screen, ""Oklahoma"" was a groundbreaking musical, but the DVD releases of the film have left a good bit to be desired. Fortunately, for the most part, the famous songs, terrific choreography, and surprisingly effective dramatic elements come through, even if the picture quality isn't as good as it should be.

Prior to ""Oklahoma,"" most stage musicals were either musical reviews with some comic bits thrown in as filler, or plays in which the action stopped every so often for an unrelated musical routine. ""Oklahoma"" was the first musical that incorporated song and dance numbers into the storyline as elements that advanced a dramatic plot. The show was a big hit on Broadway (and has remained so whenever performed ever since) and paved the way for other Rodgers and Hammerstein and similar lavish musicals that made it to the big screen before ""Oklahoma"" did. However, the film version did feature another important cinematic first: it was the first film ever made in Todd-AO, a widescreen process that featured much better resolution than other forms of movie photography at the time. Because many theaters weren't equipped to show Todd-AO, the movie was filmed scene-by-scene two separate times, in both Todd-AO and conventional Cinemascope.

Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals often featured two separate lead couples, to spread out the musical numbers among a larger cast. The storyline of ""Oklahoma"" features two love triangles. In a mostly comic triangle, Ado Annie (Gloria Grahame), a girl with a wandering eye, has to choose between earnest but square cowboy Will (Gene Nelson), who wants to spend his life with her, and the silvery tongued peddler Ali Hakim (Eddie Albert), who wants to spend a couple of nights with her. In the considerably more serious main storyline, the somewhat immature Laurie (Shirley Jones, in her film debut) faces her own choice between dashing and charming cowboy Curly (Gordon McRae) and the rather unkempt and crude farmhand Jud (Rod Steiger). Laurie enjoys the idea of both men paying attention to her and accepts Jud's invitation to a big dance, primarily so Curly won't take her for granted. She then dumps Jud rather unceremoniously, which Jud, who has a very dark side to him, doesn't take well.

""Oklahoma"" features some of Broadway's best known tunes, including the title song, ""Oh What a Beautiful Morning,"" ""Surrey with a Fringe on Top,"" and ""People Will Say We're in Love."" However, for those who haven't seen the musical in one format or another, the real show stoppers are the dance numbers, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, which are a mix of country and ballet. Director Fred Zinnemann wisely filmed the dance routines from a distance, so that, in most shots, the camera captures all the performers full length. Each individual shot is lengthy as well, without the rapid fire cutting that is common in current musicals but which makes it difficult to appreciate what each dancer is doing. The highlight is a nearly 15-minute ""Dream Ballet"" sequence, in which Laurie, who has taken a drug given her by Ali Hakim, imagines life with both Curly and Jud, the latter version rapidly becoming quite nightmarish.

The confrontation between Curly and Jud is the dramatic highlight of the show, and it is surprisingly effective. A charity auction in which Jud and Curly literally bid for Laurie's affections is as suspenseful as any musical scene I can recall. It's hard not to feel a bit of sympathy for Jud, who has labored hard to make Laurie's farm successful but finds himself a mere plaything. However, production standards of the era mandated that the film make quite clear how unsuitable a suitor he actually is and Steiger's intense performance leaves no doubt. It's possible to quibble a bit about some of the casting (Grahame is too old for her role and Albert doesn't appear the slightest bit authentic as a Middle Easterner), but, in almost every regard, ""Oklahoma"" is a wonderful viewing experience.

Wonderful, that is, except for the DVD presentation. This 1999 DVD release is the Todd-AO version of the film (which includes the Overture and Entr'acte music during intermission), which was largely unavailable for decades. Unfortunately, as with many films released on DVD at that time, this DVD is not anamorphic, and when blown up and shown on a modern big screen HDTV, the image leaves a lot to be desired. The image is particularly distracting in the Dream Ballet sequence, parts of which seem to be taking place amidst giant red smoke bombs. ""Oklahoma"" was later re-released in a ""50th Anniversary"" DVD edition, which featured both the Cinemascope and Todd-AO versions of the film, and, based on the reviews I've read, the Todd-AO version of that DVD is problematic as well. Anyone thinking of getting the 1999 version should also be aware that, contrary to what's stated on the Amazon page, the abundant extra features on the 50th Anniversary version, including two audio commentaries, are not present on the 1999 release. Instead, the only extra feature is the theatrical trailer.

""Oklahoma"" remains a marvelous cinematic experience, and it is well worth seeing despite the somewhat deficient picture quality. My understanding is that a restored Todd-AO print of the movie is finally available, and my guess is that it will be used as the master for a Blu-ray release. Those wanting the best possible viewing experience may want to wait for that Blu-ray, but for others, ""Oklahoma"" is more than OK.",1405987200,,5598,5.012903225806451

I memorized many of the songs. Composers are not writing words and music like Rodgers and Hammerstein did - their songs were memorable. I find myself signing many of them every day - over 70 years later.  How many people know the lyrics and music to songs in many current shows?
Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae were exceptional in the film version of Oklahoma (1955). This CD came from the movie version; not the play which ran from 1943-1948.

Referring to other reviewers who thought the acting was a bit stiff.....this wonderful MUSICAL was made when they cast singers in the lead roles instead of big name stars who have to have their voices dubbed. Referring to another member's review that felt the dream sequence was too scary for children - not any scarier than Snow White or Bambi. Life has frightening moments in it; children shouldn't be sheltered from all of them. I saw this movie for the first time when I was seven or eight and yes, the dream sequence was a bit disturbing, as it was meant to be, but I was more aware of the sheer artistry of it. Rogers and Hammerstein didn't feel that because they were making a musical that it had to be sugar coated. All of their musicals have a serious side which makes them more complex and all the better for it. With their transcendent melodies and insightful lyrics and incredible choreography Rogers and Hammerstein raised the bar for musicals to come.

205846,4,5554454828,"I noticed all the bad reviews for this DVD and I have to say, I don't know why it has such horrible reviews? No, the DVD's aren't perfect, although the CinemaScope is beautiful, the color pops, the sound is great, and the overall quality is superb.

The main gripe seems to be about the Todd AO version. I didn't know anything about this until I read about it on here and seeing as I didn't have Oklahoma! on DVD yet, I decided to buy the set, horrible reviews aside.

I played the Todd AO version in my Blu-Ray player and I have to say, it looked pretty good to me. Not perfect and yes, I think they could have transferred it better, but it is viewable and pleasurable at the same time.

This is what I found wrong, in my opinion, with the Todd AO, but it didn't deter me from watching it.

1. There is some pulsating of the lighting in the background which your eyes adjust to after awhile and you don't even notice it anymore.

2. When they are focusing on an actor/face, the background does appear somewhat blurry, but it's a soft blur, which from an artistic standpoint is sort of pretty.

3. The blacks are very, very black. For example, in Judd's cabin, which it is blacks/browns, Curly's head really blends in w/the scenery and the whole scene is very dark w/no depth.

4. Many have said that because the Todd AO was filmed in the morning, the actors were more lively, etc. I didn't see this at all. Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRea especially seemed to be nearly identical in both copies of the film. He might have been a little more animated when singing the opening, but not much. Charlotte Greenwood might have danced a tiny bit more lively in ""The Farmer and the Cowman"", but only a tad. The only actress I noticed a large difference in acting with was Gloria Grahame ""Ado Annie"", she was much more animated in the singing parts and acting in the Todd AO version, especially noticeable during ""I Can't Say No"" and ""All 'Er Nothin'"". Also, the peddler playing opposite her in the ""goodbye"" seen is more lively, he pushes her sleeve up twice and she continues to push it up v the CinemaScope version where he pushes her sleeve up once, it slides down, and they leave it. Small minor detail I happened to notice. Shirley Jones sobs very little in the Todd AO scene after Judd scares her, but quite a lot in the CinemaScope version.

I haven't viewed them side by side for every frame, but I plan to, just for fun. I do recommend this set, if you want to own both versions. Play the Todd AO version on a Blu-Ray player and it really isn't that bad. It honestly reminded me of movies that weren't remastered on old VHS tapes and we watched them without complaint. Too me, it's simply nice to have in my collection. Would I buy the Todd AO version again if they release it in better quality, sure, but this is perfectly fine for now. Just enjoy the movie for what it is.",1360972800,4,2876,4.352611940298507

205852,5,5554454828,"""Oklahoma!"" was the first of the Rogers & Hammerstein musicals; and this film adaptation of the stage play is among the best ever movie musicals. I personally love all of the R&H film adaptations and won't quibble about ranking...they are all outstanding. ""Oklahoma!"", as in most R&H musicals, epitomized the development of the ""book musical"", where the songs and dances are fully integrated into the story, with serious drama that is intended to evoke emotions other than joy and laughter. For example, the plotline features a grim villain, Judd Fry (played superbly by Rod Steiger) who competes with Curly for the love of Laurey. Gordon MacRae is Curly and Jennifer Jones (in her film debut) is Laurey; and they are both in perfect pitch throughout this film. In addition look for outstanding performances from Gloria Grahame, as Ado Annie, ""the girl who can't say no."" and the delightful character actor, Charlotte Greenwood as Laurey's Aunt Eller. Also look for Gene Nelson, who as Will Parker, demonstrates his talent as a dancer, in addition to his singing. If you're a fan of movie musical or of popular music, you will recognize the R&H standards and probably be able to sing right along with the cast...""chicks and ducks and geese better scurry, when I take you out in the surrey..",1359331200,,1290,4.922018348623853

People dump on the movie, so one can only imagine what the play must have been like as the movie is, by todays standards, astounding.

We live in an age where adults long to be children.  You go into a theater to see a pre-war or mid-century movie and for ninety minutes you're among sophisticated adults, having adult affairs, going to adult night clubs, dressing like grown ups.  Then the lights come up, you leave the theater, the zippy music still bouncing about your head and the audience is all in their hoodies and sneakers like kids.  The quality of our entertainment has been dumbed down accordingly.

""Oklahoma"" was made when people dressed up to go to the Theater;  long before people wore flip flops to the White House or a three star restaurant.  It's a love story complicated by violent jealousy.  It's a musical where every song is hummable, and often, like an opera, moves the plot along.  And, right in the middle, there's a fantasy dance number, a ballet, exploring the dark side of the story.  Musicals for adults, intelligent entertainment for people who didn't consider their brains to be surplus equipment.

""Oklahoma"" is beautifully filmed, set to a wonderful score and makes for a great couple of hours in front of the TV.  I'm not so thrilled with ""South Pacific"" but it's interesting to watch them close enough to see the similarities in the songs---how they almost pair off one to one.

No, the expensive anniversary two disc collection is not worth the money---the HD is dark and grainy.  Get a respected copy of the original and wait until the studio stops making excuses and delivers an HD version that is as good as the film itself.",1356220800,2,1930,4.632352941176471

205891,4,5554454828,"This was the first collaboration between Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein after the death of Rodgers' previous song-writing partner, Lorenz Hart. Hammerstein also wrote the original book on which the screen-play was based. The show, which won the 1944 Pulitzer Prize, opened on Broadway on 31 March 1943 and the film followed in 1955. The show and film were more serious than the frivolous Viennese operetta or joined-up vaudeville type musicals that preceded it. Instead of a contemporary theme, the story was set in Oklahoma Territory in the early 1900s.

The central love story revolves around ranch-hand Curly (Gordon Macrae) and Laurey (Shirley Jones), daughter of a pioneer farmer. There are fine performances from the supporting cast of Gene Nelson, Gloria Grahame, Eddie Albert, James Whitmore and Rod Steiger (as Jud Fry, who tries to break up the romance). So many of the songs have remained in the popular repertoire for more than 60 years: `Oh what a beautiful morning', `Surrey with the fringe on top', `Out of my dreams' (presented as a fine ballet sequence), `People will say we're in love' and, of course, `Oklahoma'.

It was on TV yesterday (not in letterbox though, ugh), and you can't help smiling at the tunes, innocence, and sweet romance.
Shirley Jones is stunning to look at in her introduction to the big screen, and her voice packs an equally big punch. If I had a beau as good-looking and sweet with a voice like Gordon MacRae, well, I think I'd have to agree with Aunt Eller when she tells him, ""why, I'd marry you and git you to set around at night and sing to me.""
In a way, I can't help drawing a comparison between Gordon MacRae and fellow show-stopping actor/singer Howard Keel. Big men with rustic good looks and crystal clear booming voices.

This is an excellent way to experience this classic film at a time of your choosing. These outstanding musicals are just not shown often enough on broadcast channels anymore.

205909,4,5554454828,"GUESS WHAT?  The BLU-RAY is out, and the Todd-AO version is now far, far superior to the DVD.  The following comments are based on the old DVD and the Todd-AO version in the theater:  Fox shouldn't blame the fledging Todd-AO itself, even though retrofitted onto existing cameras, for any of their problems with the Todd-AO transfer.  I saw the original 70 mm Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! in the '50s, in San Francisco.  I was a dedicated amateur photographer, working in both 35 mm and larger formats, and my photography friends and I marveled at the detail that got on the screen in Todd-AO.  ""Everyone"" was talking about it!  One day I was getting my hair cut and the stranger in the next chair started telling the barber how great Todd-AO was.  It turned out he was a photographer too.

There was only one brief series of shots that was not clear -- during the ""Many a new day"" song, the young women toward the extreme right and left sides of the screen were not sharp in certain shots.

Words like ""sharp"" and ""clear"" may not be the most descriptive.  At that time Kodak divided sharpness into two correlated properties ""acutance"" and ""resolution.""  ""Resolution"" had the same definition as it does today, and, in use,  was practically a synonym for detail or definition.  ""Acutance"" was the capacity of a medium to make sharp edges -- like a knife edge -- look sharp .., and it was associated with a number of other factors, like contrast, and appropriateness of the brightness.  The first two Todd-AO films, Oklahoma! (1955) and Around the World in 80 Days (1956) films had very high resolution, but very slightly softer acutance than some of the later 70 mm films (some of these later films had what reviewers commonly called ""an etched look"").  They both had very natural appearing color, more natural than usual in the movies, and more natural than we were used to seeing with the color print and slide films we were used to using.

Oklahoma! & 80 Days could both remain clear and detailed even when we moved down very close to the screen (row 9).  Even people sitting farther back were treated to a very large image, because there was no stage, organ, or orchestra pit between the viewers and the screen ... the seats went right down almost to the chord of the curved screen's arc (at least in San Francisco).  We measured the apparent size of the image with a calibrated detachable viewfinder, and found that the Todd-AO image (AR of 2.2:1) from the 20th row at the Coronet was about the same size in the viewfinder as was a 35 mm widescreen image (2.35, approximately) in the 5th row at the Grand Lake in Oakland, a movie palace with organ, stage, and pit taking up space.  It should be noted that after a dispute between formats as childish as the VHS/Betamax or Blu-ray HD-DVD wars, the size of the image at the Coronet was reduced, when they took out the deeply curving Todd-AO screen, and put in a very shallowly curved screen that would be compatible with competing 70 mm formats.  We simply moved closer after that change.  They left the deeply curved curtains in place .. did they think nobody would notice?

One last note: The 6 channel magnetic sound was magnificent, and had really high dynamic range.  The trombones and tuba between stanzas of the ""The Farmer and the Cowman"" song seemed to nearly rip the roof off.  It was responsible for making me an audiophile.",1269648000,6,3386,4.622073578595318

205916,3,5554454828,"Lets be honest here! What Fox wants you to believe is utter rubbish! Having been involved in film to video restoration as a telecine colorist I think I know a little bit about the process.

The one thing that Fox is right about is that many negs, ip's and print negs were stored impropperly. Eastman stock developed vinigar syndrome, faded and shrunk. Becoming unusable. The studio's woke up to the fact and started to store  their precious titles in more climate friendly vaults and salt mines. Yup...salt mines.

I have seen several prints, (not negs) in theatres and in private collections. Some have faded and lost color, (turning pink) while others are basicly as beautiful as they day they were struck.

If Fox wnted to do an ""HONEST"" transfer of a TODD-AO print or neg, it could have used numerous sources to obtain, borrow or copy elements from existing materials other than a badly damaged IP. IP's (inter Posatives) that some studios will xfer from are well known to have limited range and depth for video xfers than a neg or a print-neg.  Fox was being lazy and decided for some unknown reason to use most likely the only complete, or close at hand elements they had rather than do some research and find propper materials to xfer from!

The story abotu Oklahoma! being soft is that....a story. All the prints and footage and frames from TODD-AO prints are anything but soft. The efinition is the Oklahoma! prints is truely breath taking.

Fox would have been better to have left some of the film damage in and retain the sharpness of the TODD-AO versions. Fox woudl have been bette to have used the available technology and use the pre-existing 4x3 letterbox TODD-AO version and line doubled it to make it full screen.

You would be amazed aas to the amount of color that can be pulled out of a faded print using sate of the art equipment like a daVinci color corrector. Would the color be perfect? No, but it would be sharp and enjoyable. Then they could have gone into digital color restoration and boosted it up even more.

If Fox have have had the backbone to have said ""hey we made a mistake"" I woudl respect that and say well atlet they know they messed up.

205917,4,5554454828,"Overall, this is a refreshing nice old-fashioned musical and a visual treat as well. I really liked the first part of this movie best with all the famous songs and great color that looks even better on DVD....and just a great feel of old-time wholesomeness.

The story is just about two romances: the main ""contest:"" Gordon McCrae and Rod Steiger both vying for Shirley Jones, and the minor one with Gloria Grahame and two suitors. Grahame, with her humor as ""Ado Annie Carnes"" is the best character in the film, at least to me. Eddie Albert also chips in with some humor as the ""peddler"" and Charlotte Greenwood was good as ""Aunt Eller.""

Jones and McCrae are about as ""All-American"" as you can get and Steiger is the lone ""villain"" of the film. The most colorful segment of the movie was the dream scene that featured a great set.

If I could change anything with this film, I'd reduce it in length down to two hours, which is plenty.",1238371200,3,936,4.5266272189349115

205920,5,5554454828,"This glorious Rogers and Hammerstein musical is set in turn-of-the-century Oklahoma, where cowboy Curly (Gordon MacRae) is in love with farm girl Laurey (Shirley Jones), and she thinks he's pretty special, too.  They tease each other but can't seem to speak their real feelings, which leaves Laurie going to the big box social with the odious ranch hand, Jud Fry (Rod Steiger).

The movie is full of beautiful stars and songs with a wholesome, romantic story.  Gordon MacRae was a dreamy hunk o' man and he could sing great, too.  He definitely made the perfect singing cowboy hero.  Shirley Jones, making her movie debut at just 21, was the perfect fresh-faced innocent and what a voice!  She and MacRae had great chemistry.  Menacing Rod Steiger balances their idealism with his bitterness and even sings and dances.

The songs have become familiar over the years because they're just so happy and easy to sing; ""Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,"" ""Surrey with the Fringe on Top,"" and ""People Will Say We're in Love"" are gorgeous and ""Oklahoma!"" is bursting with pride and joy.  There are some beautifully-filmed ranch scenes, but also some outdoor scenes filmed on a soundstage that look stagey, and the ballet sequences go on a bit too long for my taste.  But those are small quibbles; it's a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.",1229731200,2,1330,4.845132743362832

Visually, the Cinemascope version (Disc 1 of 2) of the 2005 DVD yields the best picture (on wide zoom). Sonically, however, the 1999 DVD sounds better than the 2005 DVD as well as the 2001 remastered audio CD. The sound of the '99 DVD, which had been given THX sound processing, is much more open, bright, and dynamic with clear highs. The sound of the '05 DVD, which really doesn't sound too bad, comes across very slightly muffled, as if it had a layer of gauze placed over it, unfortunately deadening the highs and restricting the openness. So if it's the best picture you're looking for, get the 50th Anniversary DVD. If you want the best sound, get the '99 DVD.",1216684800,3,781,4.546099290780142

205930,4,5554454828,"I bought the single disc version that was released in 1999 and the disc says that this is the Todd-AO version and so to fully appreciate the merits of an even wider than usual presentation, the film is shown here in a letterbox format which on my widescreen plasma tv just doesn't quite do it for me.  I have to say that the clarity is good in that it is a lot better than what I've been used to when it comes to films of that era and comparing with films like ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and even ""The Searchers"" I have to say that just the clearness and the detail really impressed me.

The opening credits looked strange and it looked as if for me to truly appreciate the Todd-AO process I would need to wear 3-D glasses as that was what the opening credits looked like to me like one of those old movies at the drive in that required you to put on your 3-D glasses otherwise the film looked strange.  However, after the opening credits, the rest of the film was okay except that the letterbox format made the film appear really small on my widescreen and I had to sit forward to enjoy the film.  The sound quality had a 5.1 surround option and has been THX mastered but does not sound as good as other similar dvds with this option that I'd heard but it was nice to have this option anyway.  The problem is that the spoken dialogue especially at the start was occasionally very soft but the singing parts suddenly had volume increases which bothered me a bit but I guess that shows that not enough effort was put into the proper mastering required for a 5.1 surround treatment.  There are also a few frames of imperfections in terms of picture quality such as the usual culprits of white spots etc that should be cleaned up with the new and modern equipment with computers etc that they have nowadays at their disposal.

The storyline drags on just a little but I always liked ""Oklahoma"" for the quality of the songs anyway and so I wasn't too bothered about that as the songs are brilliantly performed and for me still stand the test of time as all classics do.  I never grow tired of listening to them especially my favourites ""Surrey With the Fringe On Top"" and ""People Will Say We're In Love.""  With the advent of Blu-ray, I'm hoping the powers that be will somehow adapt the Todd-AO so that we get as much of the benefits as possible but adapted to plasma widescreens as frankly the letterbox format doesn't do it for me and seems like a waste of much of the screen that is in black on the top and bottom.  Also, they have to improve upon the sound quality.

Overall, this is still a good dvd but if they make the above improvements for the Blu-ray version, I'll certainly be interested in ""upgrading"".  I'm a big fan of musicals and while the storyline isn't brilliant and in fact can get a little boring at times and the music isn't the greatest ever, this is overall when you put everything together still a great musical and strikes a chord with me that I can hardly put down in words and yet it is still my favourite musical of all time.  I guess the best I can describe it is that it gives me that unique ""Oklahoma Experience"" just like a Jimi Hendrix performance where it's not just listening and viewing but you have to experience the whole package.

I hope you enjoy this too as much as I have over the years although you may want to wait and see what they do with the Blu-ray version.  Perhaps some techniques like the Todd-AO process cannot do justice to the viewer unless it is viewed in the way it was meant to i.e. on the large screen of a properly equipped movie theatre and so any attempts at replicating the Todd-AO experience will fall short every time on dvd?  If my suspicions are correct then I hope the upcoming Blu-ray version will have both the ""normal"" Cinemascope and the Todd-AO version to satisfy all camps but of course with all necessary improvements stated above included.",1210377600,,3908,4.37707182320442

The main thing that holds me back from considering this a worthy film is the message given to the one fellow to commit suicide.  The reasoning being that he will be remembered then.  It is all done very lightheartedly, but still that seems to be a rather peculiar message.  And one that keeps this from being a family film, I do believe.

205933,4,5554454828,"Arguably the most historically important musical in Broadway history (""Show Boat"" would be its only rival), ""Oklahoma"" inarguably has the most arresting if not dazzling opening.  We're placed smack dab in the middle of the ripe corn fields of Oklahoma and swept into the freshest, most colorful and vibrant summer morning ever captured on film--accompanied by the inviting ""O"" vowel that first lures us with ""Oh, What a Beautiful Morning"" and will eventually seal the deal with ""OOOOOOklahoma!""  And before we've recovered from this bracing beginning, we're as captivated as Shirley Jones is by Gordon McCrae's musical-visual picture of a ""Surrey With the Fringe on Top.""  No film let alone musical has a more spectacular beginning, and though it's impossible to sustain this level of exhilaration (for one thing, Rodgers and Hammerstein's second acts always tend to be anticlimactic), the total experience is still the most ""cinematic"" of all the R&H screen adaptations (""Sound of Music"" is its closest competitor cinematically, though not even close musically).

The producers of this edition do a disservice to the film by the inclusion of the Todd-A-O disc which, in its unrestored state, would best be represented by a footnote in the accompanying notes.  Moreover, the problem of sizing a 4:3 letterbox film to a 16:9 screen will best be dealt with when a hi-def version is available.

Here I have a question.  Is there a difference between the 1999 DVD version and the one that's on the 50th anniversary edition that has been so thoroughly lambasted by most of the reviewers here at amazon?  I ask this because I'm sitting here looking at the 1999 Todd A-O DVD on a 768 Line HD Plasma TV, and I must say that it looks utterly stunning!  THe sound is as crisp and rich as the laser disc, and the picture is actually an improvement.  My only complaint is that the skin tones are not quite true; but this I easily fixed by adjusting the color tint on my TV.  The picture here is bright and crisp.  So this leads me to wonder if something terrible happened to the Todd A-O transfer somewhere between the 1999 version and the one contained on the more recent 50th anniversary edition.  Can somebody who has both versions (or all three, if you count the laser disc version) shed some light on this mystery?",1195776000,2,1135,4.320754716981132

I know it is a musical,but it seemed like a minute didn't go by without someone bursting into song. I also didn't think most of the songs were all that great!

The story, however, although I didn't think anything of it at the time, now strikes me as distinctly weird. There is a strangely sinister undercurrent being played out behind the front line, and it seems to be: If you don't fit in with the rest of us, like if you're a pedlar or a hired hand, get lost. In fact, we'll help you on your way, and may even try to persuade you to hang yourself. Is this the recommended tactic for a straight-shooting ideal cowboy? The dream, or substance-induced nightmare, dance sequence is very strange, and someone else has commented on the way it doesn't match the rest of the presentation. It seems to be dredged up from some suppressed vision of darkness, perhaps faintly similar to the hidden side of wholesome America in Lynch's Blue Velvet. Very curious.

The movie is timeless - accept it as Hollywood fluff, sit back and enjoy the outstanding dancing, rousing music that sometimes approaches the heroic, clever lyrics and actors in atypical roles. I wish they would show this in movie houses again as it cries out for big screen treatment. Until then, this two-set DVD will have to do, warts and all.

For the film buff it is worth the price just for the comparison between the two versions. The movie was shot twice to accommodate the different cameras.  Checking them out reveal subtle and not so subtle variations (the opening scene of ""Kansas City"" for instance) due to the angles and freshness of the actors and dancers (Todd-AO better in this respect, IMHO). There's also the scene in ""Kansas City"" where Will breaks through the packing case -- in CinemaScope he does it right, in Todd-AO only one foot breaks through and he is only kept from falling by Lizanne Truex's quick reaction.

I suggest that on your second viewing, concentrate on the two young girls who form an on-going sub-plot as teens infatuated with Will. They appear in every dance scene and almost attain co-star status yet are referred to only as ""Dancers"" in the credits. Pay particular attention to the pixie-like blonde, Lizanne Truex, who is emphasized throughout the film moreso than her partner, Jane Fischer. An outstanding and very talented actress/dancer who unfortunately didn't appear in any other films - a loss to the trade IMHO. She also had three one-liners, which is unusual for ensemble dancers.

Check out my profile's website for my tribute to her as well as the IMDb ""Oklahoma"" message board discussion titled ""Who are the 2 dancers?"" for recently discovered details about her. Recognition is long overdue.",1146787200,2,1954,4.873493975903615

The one good thing about this release is the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (16.9) as opposed to the bad job this and other R &H musicals have suffered in the past. But why bother going to this trouble if Fox could find decent versions of the film. One miust add the narratives are lively and interesting, though the Todd AO/Shirley Jones version seems to bare very little relevance to what is going on, on the screen. There are shorts about the miracle of Todd AO on disc two, certainly a farce considering the appaling state of the Todd AO print---and one final question, why could not the makers set the featurette on the comparisons between Scope and AO in an anamorphic print , so it best illustrates the differences in the mediums.....One can only hope that, as ""Carousel"", ""the King and I"" and ""Sth Pacific"" get the double disc special edition treatment, that someone actually bothers to find a clean  restored version of these films.....Do Fox think the public are stupid?

DVD is well documented elsewhere... The star billing on the DOCTOR DOLITTLE DVD is a big enough mistake to make Mr. Harrison's estate remind Fox about his contract. The credit block on the the tacky cover of the HELLO, DOLLY! DVD claims the film was ...""produced BY Todd-AO.""  Todd-AO is a 70mm widescreen film format, but some ignorant Foxer changed the credit from ""Produced IN Todd-AO"" because they were clueless, and an equally clueless Fox Homevid Exec approved it.

Obviously these people have NO clue about these older films, and that ignorance continued with the subesequent release of OKLAHOMA!.

This new set includes two featurettes explaining the virtues of the TODD-AO format, which debuted with OKLAHOMA!  But no one at Fox managed to connect the dots to realize that the 70mm TODD-AO version of OKLAHOMA! is the superior, preferred version of the film, and that the 35mm CinemaScope version is a lower quality second choice.

Originally TODD-AO was shot at 30 frames per second, while regular films run at 24fps.  Since most theatres wouldn't be able to install new equipment to show OKLAHOMA in 70mm at 30fps, OKLAHOMA! was shot in BOTH formats, releasing primarily in 70mm TODD-AO, then using the 35mm CinemaScope version for the cheaper sub-runs.  Therefore the 70mm TODD-AO version should be the featured version on DVD, given plenty of space on Disc One to showcase all the extra detail that 30fps 70mm contains.  The 35mm CinemaScope version should have been squeezed onto disc two as a supplement.

How do these people get their jobs and keep them after so many obvious snafus?  Did some kid at Fox think the Scope version was superior because it is ""wider?"" - not really true - the Todd-AO version is taller and has MORE picture info than the 35mm.  After OKLAHOMA! and AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, TODD-AO began to shoot at 24 fps, allowing a 35mm scope version to be extracted by cropping off the top and bottom of the original picture.  So any film originating in 70mm is going to show less picture in the cropped 35mm scope version.  But how are the Children of the Fox to know this when they refuse to ask or listen to anyone who knows?

There aren't a lot of people on Fox Video's current payroll who really know much about these films,  There are numerous websites used by film buffs who know these movies, but the Fox Video dept. don't believe in consulting their audience.  They have the arrogance of ownership (""it's THEIR film"") but they forget that they are asking for OUR money.  As one Fox Video Exec said ""the fanatics will buy it anyway.""

Warner Home Video actually employs at least one full time person who knows what he is doing with older films.  Fox does not.  Their catalog titles suffer as a result.  The only language they understand is dollars, but even if the badly produced titles don't sell, they aren't likely to connect the low sales to their own mistakes.

I cannot recommend that people support this shoddy product with their dollars, only to buy it again a couple years later when a newer version comes out.  I plan to rent the supplemental disc to watch the extras, and save my money until Fox hires people who know the product and do it right.

It is a small consolation that the second disc in the DVD set includes a great featurette on the difference between CinemaScope and Todd-AO.  This features the use of a video process called ""Smilebox"" that simulates the curved screen used in the original Todd-AO releases.

A STATEMENT FROM TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT REGARDING THE
50TH ANNIVERSARY DVD EDITION OF RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN'S ""OKLAHOMA!""

In recent days we have heard back from a small number of consumers
regarding the DVD of the Todd-AO version of ""Oklahoma!"" and specifically
that it appears less detailed than the old Fox DVD release from 2000. We
feel it is very important that we communicate the issues on hand
regarding the Todd-AO version of the film.

As you know well, director Fred Zinnemann filmed ""Oklahoma!"" using two
separate film techniques. The 35mm CinemaScope version and the then new,
large gauge 65mm film format called Todd-AO.

Firstly, the good news is that the first disc features the CinemaScope
version of the movie for the first time on DVD, and looks superlative.
This is the main feature of the new 2-disc Anniversary edition.

However, when it comes to the bonus disc featuring the Todd-AO version,
we have received reports from concerned fans that the Todd-AO version
looks 'fuzzy' or 'less detailed' than the old DVD release from 2000. How
can that possibly be?

When ""Oklahoma!"" was first released on DVD in 2000 it was the relative
infancy of DVD, and Twentieth Century Fox utilized a widescreen video
transfer of the Todd-AO version that had been made for VHS and laserdisc
back in 1994. The resulting widescreen transfer (with black bars top and
bottom) was a very pleasing presentation of the Todd-AO version.

Now, in 2005, Fox DVDs are mastered for the highest quality, supporting
widescreen TVs and HDTVs that feature a 16x9 screen format (as opposed
to 4x3 TV format). We could not simply re-use the old 1994-vintage 4x3
video transfer of the Todd-AO version because on an HDTV the old format
would reveal ugly video artifacts, anomalies and edge enhancement that
would detract from the film. This would be immediately apparent on any
widescreen standard definition TV and more so on a high definition TV.

That being decided, it was back to the IP of the Todd-AO version for an
all new high-definition transfer.

This is where time plays a detrimental role in the process. The Todd-AO
print had severely deteriorated since the 1994 video transfer and
presented a nightmare for the authoring of the DVD.

A painstaking restoration of the original elements was undertaken. The
negative was so damaged that a 'wet gate IP' had to be created in order
to preserve the film source. The biggest problem inherent in the Todd-AO
version is the appearance of soft focus and considerable color
breathing. The digital restoration team agonized over using the right
amount of dirt removal ('DRS') in order to remove the glue stains and
tears, while still trying to keep the already soft image from getting
any softer. They addressed the color breathing as well, but too much
adjustment would ultimately further harm the video presentation by
introducing ringing and aliasing caused by artificially sharpening the
picture.

Indeed, if you look at the 'Auctioning Ado Annie' scene (chapter 30) on
the Todd-AO DVD, you can still see very severe color-flashing on the far
left side of the frame. So sever was the flashing that no amount of
digital correction would help.

The process of restoring a poor element is a difficult one, and Fox
stands by its decision to give accurate representations of source
materials. While artificial edge enhancement fixes one problem, it
actually introduces more problems.

Ultimately, the decision was made to allow the DVD to present the
Todd-AO version as accurately as it can be without artificially making
it appear sharper.

In 1954/5, ""Oklahoma!"" was the first studio feature film to utilize the
new Todd-AO process, and as such, the movie was a shake out for the
system. Todd-AO lens and equipment were retro-fitted to existing camera
technology, which resulted in anomalies that would prove significantly
challenging some 50-plus years later in the digital age. By the time of
""Around the World in 80 Days,"" released nearly two years later, the
Todd-AO process was significantly more stable.

Sadly, in this day of high definition programming and movies, the
current Todd-AO print of ""Oklahoma!"" does not stand up to scrutiny of
what we think a large format film should look like. It simply isn't as
sharp or as detailed as we remember it being. And it certainly doesn't
compare to today's high definition programming.

So while the CinemaScope version is stunning, the Todd-AO version of
""Oklahoma!"" confounds DVD fans and aficionados 50 years after it was
created.  It may indeed suffer by comparison, but is, in its own right,
a good transfer given today's technology.",1132272000,187,6413,4.920222634508349

205992,2,5554454828,"This is a review of only the Todd-AO version of the movie included in the recent 50th anniversary edition of Oklahoma. The main Cinemascope version on Disc One is outstanding and deserves 5 stars and more. However the accompanying Todd-AO version on Disc Two looks abysmal in comparison.

For those who are unaware, the producers filmed two versions of Oklahoma simultaneously, the one commonly seen which is the Cinemascope version and the other, the Todd-AO version which is the one that Rodgers and Hammerstein preferred. It is seldom seen because theaters did not possess the special equipment to project these Todd-AO movies (extremely widescreen with curved edges to give an enveloping effect). The 2 movies are not the same. They did not just use different cameras or lenses to film the same scene. The films are different in that every scene is restaged specifically for either Cinemascope or Todd-AO. This is obvious in a side by side comparison - the individual scenes are subtly different. Some scenes are shot at slightly different angles, some scenes are shot at different times of the day, some scenes include cast members seen in one version but not the other while all scenes show subtle variations in performances between one version and the next. But the most obvious difference is that only the Todd-AO version includes the Oklahoma Overture as well as the Intermission, En'tracte and Finale (Exit Music) which Richard Rodgers wrote for Oklahoma but never included in the Cinemascope version. The end result is that the Todd-AO version runs for 147mins while the Cinemascope version runs for just 139mins, a fact that Fox fudges by giving the runtime of the movie as 145mins.

The Todd-AO version presented here is virtually unrestored. It is so dark you can barely read the opening credits. It is grimy. Todd-AO is shot on 70mm film (Cinemascope is on 35mm), so it should reveal exquisite detail. Instead the transfer is so soft and blurry, it is like watching a second-generation VHS tape. And although Todd-AO is shot at 30fps, as opposed to 24fps in standard film, for the express purpose of reducing film flicker, there is more flicker on the Todd-AO transfer than on the main Cinemascope version. This is a very sorry presentation of what should have been the definitive edition.

If you are buying this solely for the Cinemascope version, you won't be disappointed. It is indeed a sight to behold. If you are thinking of buying this for the Todd-AO version which few audiences today would have had the chance to see, I'd recommend waiting till Fox reissues a properly restored edition of it. In fact the Todd-AO version looks better on the old laserdisc from more than 10 years ago.

A sidenote to Fox: Please do not harangue your customers with those extremely loud, obnoxiously noisy anti-piracy messages placed at the front of all your DVDs.

I had this experience when I inserted the 50th Anniversary Edition of Oklahoma into a Sony DVP-NC80V player. First I was forced to sit through a violent and offensive anti-piracy message and then I discovered that my disc player was completely unresponsive. The remote control would not work and neither would any of the buttons on the player itself. I had to pull the plug in order to turn off the machine.

205994,1,5554454828,"I'm talking about this brand new 2DVD set of Oklahoma! 50th Anniversary, released on November 15th 2005. The concept is great, 2 discs, disc one is a CinemaScope version, disc two is a Todd-AO 70MM version, with proper widescreen aspect ratio & great sound. But the picture quality on Todd-AO version is a real garbage. Very soft, fuzzy & lack of definition as if you're watching a second generation VHS copy! The 70MM source material for this transfer is extremely bad and suffers from a severe color fading. The cinemaScope version on disc one looks much better & sharper although the color balance & color timing is totally wrong and it suffers from an extensive electronic edge enhancement, some video artifacts & color bleeding. This is not what it should be. Generally speaking, films shot in 70MM format should have far superior image & color quality than 35MM CinemaScope, but not this DVD transfer. 20th Century fox Home Video has done nothing but insult consumers. If they think they can get away with this, forget it. They can fool me once but not twice. My advice? Don't buy this DVD set. Rent it to see some wonderful special features, especially on disc two, and listen to a soundtrack, wich is very nicely remastered, but not for the image quality.",1132099200,27,1263,4.771689497716895
205995,4,5554454828,"Twelve years after its Broadway premiere this successful musical received a cinematic adaptation.  This is a musical that was considered in 1943, as the original invention for the modern stage musical, which has reached infamy and still reaches a large audience throughout the world.  The story takes place on the 1890's prairies of Oklahoma where life was tough, but love still found a way to root.

Through the cornfields of Oklahoma the audience arrives to the vast widths of the Oklahoman prairie, as the camera moves into position in the opening scene.  A man gallops on his horse into the picture, as the title screen fades in and out.  All of this is accompanied by the Richard Rogers Overture, Main Titles, as it lands the audience on the farm where most of the story takes place.  It has a little of a whimsical mood for a western where most of these films have a struggling theme.  Nonetheless, it begins to dazzle the audience with the fitting song Oh, What A Beautiful Mornin'.

The story in itself is a rather simplistic narration, which has similarities with Red Garters (1954) that was released the year before.  It intermingles a number of musical performances with a various dance numbers.  Occasionally, these dance performances come across as pretend fights, but it is a much better way of facing a rival than with a six-shooter.  The music and dance continues to astound the audience, as it elevates the story to a more dream-like mood instead of the heavy testosterone atmosphere that surrounds cowboys.

The film opens with the cowboy and cattle driver Curly McLain (Gordon MacRae) who tries to woo Laurey (Shirley Jones) in a somewhat childish manner (by teasing and acting indifferent.)  In addition, Curly is from a man's world where the tough need-nobody attitude seeps through into his tender ego, as it does to those with this self-imposed toughness.  However, he courts Laurey in Miss Aunt Eller's (Charlotte Greenwood) presence, as he is a gentleman too.  The courting opens with initial verbal tease that leads to the song The Surrey With the Fringe On Top performed by the flirting duo and later they will reunite in People Will Say We're in Love.

The love story is not without trouble from an external source, as Jud (Rod Steiger) too tries to pursue Laurey.  However, Jud's lack of personality and frightful presence intimidates her, and drives her off.  This fear of Jud enters Laurey's mind, which through a Freudian entry haunts her dreams.  The infamous dance choreographer Agnes DeMille presents her nightmare in a bizarre dance piece, which seems a little out of place.  Yet, it shines with brilliance.  However, the jealousy and vengeance that fill Jud's mind and heart will eventually lead to a crime of passion.

There are also a number of subplots such as Will Parker (Gene Nelson) returning from Kansas City (also a song Nelson sings in the film) with the fifty dollars he needs in order to marry Ado Annie Carnes (Gloria Grahame).  However, to his heartache he learns that Annie has been seeing the flirtatious salesman Ali Hakim (Eddie Albert).  This triangle drama contrasts the conflicting love story between Laurey, Curly and Jud, as this is more of a sideshow with strong comic undertones.  Many scenes are full of amusing lines such as when Ali makes the comment, ""I wanted to marry her when I saw the moonlight shining on the barrel of her father's shotgun.""

Oklahoma! captures the sheer size of the prairie in the film by shooting the film simultaneously in two different systems Todd-AO and CinemaScope, which helps transcend this musical to a delightful cinematic journey.  Unfortunately many scenes are static due to the cumbersome management of the sizeable camera equipment.  On occasions, the film feels a little too fluffy, and the acting too staged.  Yet, the film provides a warm and whimsical love story drenched in dance and song.

IMAGE NOTES:

Fifty years ago when they shot Oklahoma! they used two different cameras simultaneously: CinemaScope (2:55.1) and Todd-AO (2:20:1).  Fox has been kind to the audience by letting them see both versions, but back in the day the Todd-AO with its 70mm had a sharper and better image.  However, on this DVD the CinemaScope version appears far superior in regards to quality of clarity, sharpness, and specks.  The CinemaScope version can be found on disc one while the second disc has a fussy and, at times, a lot of digital issues on the Todd-AO version.  Yet, it is nice to be able to see these two versions and compare them, and fortunately the audience does not have to see the horrendous televised pan and scan version.",1131840000,3,4632,4.887323943661972
205996,2,5554454828,"It's been a while since I've written a review of a DVD, but I had to comment on this new 2-disc special edition of Oklahoma. First of all, it's wonderful to have the Cinemascope version available on DVD at last. This is the familiar version that I grew up with and watched (admittedly in pan-and-scan) on TV for years and years. Then in the mid-90s I heard about a ""new"" version of Oklahoma that had not been seen for years, filmed in Todd-AO. I eagerly rushed out and bought the laserdisc of this version, and brought it home. I was STUNNED! The picture was clear as crystal, sharply in focus and had almost a video-like clarity to it, due to the 30 frames-per-second Todd-AO process. The colors were sharper than I'd ever seen this movie in, and the sound was as if it had been recorded in a modern studio yesterday.

Then a few years later the advent of DVD came about and I couldn't wait for the Todd-AO version to come out and knock the socks off the laserdisc transfer. Unfortunately, I was disappointed; while a lot of the clarity was still there I could tell a lot of the sharpness was lost in the digital transfer to DVD. The lack of an anamorphic picture was not a problem as I did not yet have a wide-screen HDTV; All in all, though, the laserdisc version still looked better.

Then I bought my Sony 46"" widescreen TV, and once again waited. . .thinking the next DVD version of Oklahoma would correct not only the problems with the digital transfer but will also be anamorphic, creating an even sharper image. Tonight I picked up the new 50th anniversary DVD. First I put on the Cinemascope version. It looked excellent!. . .much better than any previous version on video of the Cinemascope Oklahoma, including the Cinemascope laserdisc which was pretty fuzzy and faded. In anticipation I switched discs to the Todd-AO version. The first thing that worried me, though, was the fact that the Todd-AO version seems to be included as an ""extra"", along with all the other extras on the second disc. I started playing it and noticed the main titles seemed out of focus. Then the picture opened up on the corn field, that first shot that made me gasp with pleasure with that Todd-AO laserdisc I got 10 or so years ago. I definitely gasped again. . .with horror! Although the 30-fps smoothness of motion is still there, the colors are faded -- and worst of all, the entire picture is out of focus! This doesn't look anywhere NEAR 70mm quality; it doesn't even match the 35mm quality of the Cinemescope version! I have to agree with the poster that said this version needs to be recalled and remastered; it is one of the worst travesties I've seen in ANY video remaster, especially considering the wonderful picture of the LASERDISC 10 years ago! If you have the original DVD version of this, my advice is hang onto it until the Blu-Ray version comes out (although considering the history of these transfers that version will probably end up having the same quality as an old Little Rascals short. This one is darned close to that!)",1131667200,38,3035,4.56697247706422
206007,2,5554454828,"I am a BIG fan of musicals. My favorite kind of movie is a musical from ""Easter Parade"" to ""My Fair Lady"" but I could not stand ""Oklahoma!"". I found it very boring with really nothing to uphold the plot. It's only worth viewing if you count some of the songs and dances. What got me the most was the plot. It was so annoying how they went back in forth. I was like just go out with him to the stupid dance!!! The other actress was equally annoying...(the one who wanted to marry the salesman) But, that's just my opinion.",1112054400,4,521,4.1683168316831685
206008,5,5554454828,"OK, so OKLAHOMA doesn't have the book (i.e., story) that many other great musicals have, and perhaps it lacks the drama of WEST SIDE STORY or MY FAIR LADY or even SOUTH PACIFIC or THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but few if any musicals ever have had as many brilliant songs.  While most musicals, even very great musicals, have at most two or three truly great songs that are sandwiched among a host of lesser numbers.  This musical, however, has seven or eight songs, and the lesser songs are far above the average for filler in such productions.  In fact, I'm not sure that any single musical has had a larger number of excellent songs.  THE SOUND OF MUSIC has perhaps more novelty songs, but it doesn't quite match the diversity of OKLAHOMA.

The film has a superb cast, including one of the great film debuts in Hollywood history:  Shirley Jones as Laurey Williams.  Although she made a number of excellent films, I have often thought that few performers were penalized by bad timing as Shirley Jones.  Her debut was in 1955, when the musical was in decline.  If she had been born twenty years earlier, she would surely have been one of the great figures in Hollywood history.  Instead of two or three great musical roles, she would have been in a dozen or more.  She was prettier than Jeannette MacDonald with a less operatic voice, and would unquestionably have made a string of films that was impossible in fifties and sixties.  Instead of only OKLAHOMA, CAROUSEL, and THE MUSIC MAN, she would certainly have added a host of great musical roles to her resume.  The rest of the cast is also quite good.  Tragically, while this was the beginning of Shirley Jones's career, it was close to the end of Gordon MacRae's star career, as his drinking was beginning to affect his reliability, and only a year later during the filming of CAROUSEL his alcoholism grew to  be such an intrusion that he was unable to continue with his career.  Rod Steiger is wonderfully menacing as Jud, and even turns in a surprisingly decent job of dancing in the ballet sequence.  Gloria Grahame is absolutely perfect as Anytime Annie, the girl who can't say no.  It is hard to imagine the film without Charlotte Greenwood as Aunt Eller.  The one odd note in the cast is Eddie Albert as the Persian Ali Hakim.  While he has several good scenes, the fact is that he neither looks nor sounds Iranian.  In fact, the first time I saw the film as a kid, I thought he was ""Parisian,"" not ""Persian.""  His accent definitely sounds more French than Persian.

My only complaint with the film is that the story is a bit on the slim side.  It is more or less an attempt to build an epic on a girl's agreeing to accompany the wrong guy to a box social, with a wedding tacked onto the end.  Mainly what happens in the film is a succession of great songs.  Actually, I have a second complaint, and it is one that all the people I have seen this film with also complain about:  the long ballet number that results from Laurey's drug use.  It interrupts the flow of the film as a whole, isn't terribly interesting to watch, and is slightly disconcerting through having dancers who are clearly not Gordon MacRae or Shirley Jones perform the number (though Rod Steiger does portray Jud in the number).  The rest of the film maintains its appeal through our concerning ourselves with the fate of the characters, but the dance removes the characters from the screen entirely.

All in all, however, this remains one of the most entertaining musicals ever made.  It captures Rodgers and Hammerstein at their creative peak as well as one of the most exciting screen debuts of all time.",1099267200,15,3630,4.564142194744977

206010,1,5554454828,"I have never seen anything more boring and tedious than this film. I was forced to watch this one summer Sunday night when nothing else was on T.V., and had finished the book I was reading. I wasn't particulary looking forward to seeing it, because I didn't like ""The Sound of Music"", ""South Pacific"", or ""Carosuel"", but I like old movies, and thought I'd give it a chance. Also it had gotten such great reviews and all and I believe it won Best Picture at the Academy Awards back in '56. After what felt like 48 hours of bordem, I came to the conclusion that this was offically the most over-rated film I have EVER seen! The promblem wasn't even that it was a musical. I like musicals, but this was just awful! The (lyrical) music and dancing was just STUPID. The story was over-used, and the charectors ANNOYING! The only reason I give this a star and 1/2 is because it was tecnically well made, even tho the music and dancing was atrocious! I can't really reccomend this movie or not, becuase I think it really depends on a persons taste.

206011,1,5554454828,"My distant memories of this film were from the night when Jimmy Carter was elected president...back in the late 70's when you had only the 3 network channels, PBS, and 2 local channels. The networks were covering the election, and this must have been all that was playing because I watched it that night. I was about 13 yrs. old. I definitely remember the opening where Curly is singing ""Oh, what a beautiful morning"", and the tune stuck in my head all these years. But I also remember being very aggrivated that all they did was sing and sing and sing and sing, and it was so so so boring!!! Yes, I know it was a musical, but it seemed more like an opera to me. I was 13 mind you, and so as I looked back, I thought perhaps because of my youth and inexposure to good film, I had misjudged this film.
Fast forward 29 years or so, to the other night. I have since studied classic film and appreciate it very much. To be honest,I am still not very fond of musicals in general, unless they are good. Meaning, they do some acting and talking too, not just sing, sing, sing, and if the singing fits with the story. Musicals I enjoy are The Sound of Music, some of the Nelson Eddy ones like I Married an Angel (because it is fun and silly!) and The Chocolate Soldier, Elvis' GOOD movies- King Creole and Jailhouse Rock ( I like his songs in his not-so-great Love Me Tender too), White Christmas, and Mary Poppins can be fun every now and then. But other than that, musicals in general do nothing for me because they are too weird. Here in Oklahoma!, well, yes, the photography and color ARE beautiful. But it certainly isn't enough to carry the whole picture. I felt it did have a very good opening, and I do like that song. And the song about the surrey was okay too. But most of the others were just plain silly. And I kept thinking, well can these folks just start talking and acting and quit singing all the time?? Just get on with the story please!!! In the beginning I was interested to see what the social was going to be like, but they had to sing and sing and sing, on and on and on and on...that it put me to sleep and I missed the social, the part I was waiting for!! I did wake up again, only to hear MORE singing, and by then it was the same aggrivating experience I had when I was 13 years old. I don't care to watch tap dancing cowboys, or girls who play hard-to-get and thus cause a bunch of trouble. The Laurey character should have just gone with the Curly character to the social instead of using Judd as a token in her little game of playing hard-to-get. The film was so fluffy and lightweight and empty, and what weird turn into darkness it took when Curly and Judd had a chat in the smokehouse. No serious thing could fit in this film. It is like covering a Twinkie, in all its artificial sickeningly sweet fluffiness, with gravy and trying to make it a meal. Yuck!  Nothing of this story ended up being of any interest to me. Well, this is my opinion folks. I know lots of people absolutely adore this film, and that's just fine. But I don't. But still, I will always enjoy listening to Nelson Eddy on my daughter's CD as he sings, ""Oh, what a beautiful morning...""",1078444800,4,3182,4.250825082508251
206012,3,5554454828,"I finally broke down and watched this movie last night. I have always made a point of avoiding it, knowing full well it was a corny melodydrama. The melody proved to win out over the drama.
Anyway, last summer I found Nelson Eddy's record of the Oklahoma score. Nelson or no Nelson, I was only able to get through it a couple of times. As a rule, I don't go for tap-dancing cowmen and hick folks singing about everything being up to date in Kansas City.
OK, now about the movie. If nothing else, it held my attention for the eternity it seemed to play. I did fast forward the overture, the entr'acte, and Ado Annie's songs. But I watched the rest.
Gordon MacRae wasn't bad; neither was Shirley Jones. I think she was quite pretty in her pre-Partridge days. Not half bad as a singer, either. The man who played Jud was suitably creepy and disgusting. In fact, I think the most powerful element of the story was Jud's stalking Laurie. However, that element kinda got lost in between songs. I did not go for the ballet in the boudoir. I found it a little difficult to swallow that rural Oklahoman females would all be so gloriously accomplished at plis and pirouettes. I did like Shirley Jones' dresses. Ado Annie, Ali Hakim, and Will were incredibly annoying. The scenery was beautiful - a pity they didn't show more of it. I did not like the short-haired bleach blonde dancer. She disturbed my tranquillity.
Now, the dream sequence was probably the most interesting part of the movie. Not a word spoken or sung, if I remember correctly - but how much was said with gestures and the surreal lighting, backdrops, and sparse sets. Very, very powerful. I liked also the way they cut off for the entr'acte, when she wakes up to see Jud standing there.
I found the end to be incredibly hokey. Oh, if only it had ended when the last strains of Oklahoma, OK! wafted away into silver screen space. But no, we are compelled to sit through a weak resolution to the conflict with Jud, a few appearances by Ado Annie, and a corny court session held in Aunt Eller's kitchen. Not to my particular liking. It was late and I was so incredibly ready for it to be over.
I really doubt I'll ever watch this again. Of the four or so R&H musicals I've seen, The Sound of Music is my enduring favourite. State Fair is also very sweet, if not particularly deep. Oklahoma has not increased my desire to see more of their work-on-film, but perhaps someday I shall.
It's not that I hate musicals (I used to, but Nelson Eddy changed my mind). It's just that I prefer the escapist type  la 1930's and early 40's M-G-M: New Moon, Rose-Marie, Sweethearts, The Chocolate Soldier...  The mood and style of musicals had drastically changed by the 50's and the ones made then just don't appeal to me.
My advice: Watch this movie if you're a fan of 1950's musicals or Rodgers and Hammerstein, or just for the experience, if you're a classic film fan who has to see all the ""classics"". I wouldn't class this as a classic because it ain't classy - but, each to his own.",1078099200,,3030,4.457657657657657

Imagine my surprise when I saw Turner's broadcast of it in the 'Todd-AO' wide-screen version!! The color saturation is positively stunning (it has been mentioned that the T-AO film process actually shot more frames per second, which accounts for that sharpness and saturation) and makes certain sequences, like the opening number ""Oh What A Beautiful Morning"" and sections of the ""Out Of My Dreams"" ballet explode on screen. The Rodgers & Hammerstein songs are magnificent (notably ""Poor Jud is Dead,"" ""I Cain't Say No,"" and ""People Will Say We're In Love""), the color cinematography is stunning (note the crisp, blue skies), a lasso dance by Gene Nelson in a railway depot is a standout, but some of the characters and subsequent performances (like Rod Steiger's manic-depressive farmhand Jud) are more than a bit over-the-top.

The music in Oklahoma is great and gets better to me the more I watch it.  I also liked it visually.  The acting and dancing do not disappoint.  A positive mood is definitely created and sustained.
The story is fair enough.  It primarily revolves around the rivalry Curly and Jud have for Laurey.  It is set in Oklahoma just before Oklahoma joined the Union.  The character of Jud Fry adds a more somber tone to the movie though it is dealt with alternatively both humorously and darkly.  Curly mocking Jud (and Jud unwittingly joining him) by singing 'Jud Fry is Dead' is classic.  Themes such as pornography, sexual promiscuity, and murder are subtley touched on giving it more of an adult air.  I consider it a kid friendly movie just not as innocent as some might suspect.

In the case of ""Oklahoma"" it was the tune ""I Cain't Say No"", sung by Zasu Pitts as boy-crazy Ado Annie. The song is exactly as the title suggests--the statement of a lady who doesn't have the sex appeal to facilitate coyness. She likes men and has found that it's best to let us know it. I've dated at least one such woman--don't knock it. And, she suggests, the coy act can sometimes be counterproductive for the foxy ladies as well. Delivered in Pitts' thin voice, the tune never did get designated ""our song"" by couples, but such songs get you paying attention to the lyrics--every word. I first saw Pitts in her TV role as second-banana to Gale Storm (whatta name--sounds like a name for a stripper!) in ""Oh Susannah"", a series about a cruise ship (no, ""Love Boat"" wasn't the first). Pitts didn't impress me in her role there as Elvira ""Nugey"" Nugent, but then again, I was a little kid. She's brilliant here as Ado Annie, though. I've heard women with a lot better voices sing ""I Cain't Say No"" in other productions of this show (including high school), but to me the only true version is found here, sung by a woman with a wierd name and a voice that doesn't exactly blow you away--Zasu Pitts""",999302400,,1410,4.447876447876448

206045,5,5554454828,"Considering this motion picture is some forty-six years of age, an adapation of a Broadway musical that opened in 1943, almost fifty-seven years ago, this DVD version of the 1955 film, with respect to opinions to the contrary expressed elsewhere, is simply splendid.
While declaring the timeless joy of this film, I can't help but feel disappointed that producers couldn't find locations in Oklahoma to shoot the exterior scenes, opting for the empty spaces of Arizona.  That aside, what a grand adaptation of what many consider the first modern musical.
While Gordon MacRae a very good Curly, Shirley Jones is truly marvelous as Laurie the central character in a story that has been characterized as, ""who will take Laurie to the dance.""
As is so often the case, the filmmakers key casting decisions determine the quality of motion pictures.  Eddie Albert is an excellent Peddler, Ali Hakim.  Gloria Grahame's performance as Ado Annie Carnes sparkles.
Agnes De Mille dances have made this musical one of the best ever.  I'm was particularly impressed with ""Kansas City,"" ""Out of My Dreams,"" (dream ballet) and the ""The Farmer and the Cowman.""
The one disappointment, as I reflect on the last few scenes, is why the producers/directors didn't utilize the Oklahoma vistas for the title production number, ""Oklahoma!""  The Rodgers and Hammerstein classic deserved more elaborate staging/spectacle.
This is yet another musical that should become part of the literature/fine arts curriculum.  It's study would enrich senior high school social studies, literature and fine arts classes.",986774400,13,1581,5.278884462151394
206046,4,5554454828,"""Oklahoma!"" was a classic AMerican musical, groundbreaking in its seamless integration of story, score, and dance, and a highly entertaining show in its own right with a thin but delightful story and classic score, the first of many classic scores to come from Rodgers and Hammerstein.  THankfully, most of that vitality, freshness, and joy, not to mention the story and score, translate accurately and brilliantly, and very entertainingly, into the splashy 1955 film version, which is perfectly cast, sung and orchestrated, and competently directed by Fred Zinneman, (of ""High Noon"" and ""From Here To Eternity"" fame) whose only movie musical this was.
The gorgeous shots of the Midwestern landscape can probably best be appreciated in the widescreen Todd-AO version.  (The film was famously filmed twice, in the new process and in standard Cinemescope to accomadate theatres who did not have the new technology installed)  Gordon McRae is a marvelous Curley, full of energy, sarcasm, and romantacism, and he sings those songs to perfection.  He and the original Curley, Alfred Drake, are the best I've heard.  The radiant Shirley Jones is perfect in her film debut as Laurey.  The supporting cast is all first-rate; other reviewers have mentioned Gloria Grahame's Ado Annie, which is indeed a hilarious and unforgettable performance, but there is also Gene Nelson's wonderful Will Parker, Charlotte Greenwood's loveable and delightful Aunt Eller, and Rod Steiger's adaquately menacing Jud Fry.  (That last character loses some dimension through the deletion of his solo ""Lonely Room,"" but Steiger probably wouldn't have sung it all that well, and the rest of the film is so perfect, that this is really a minor quibble)  It should be noted that, even though this cast contains quite a few actors not noted for their singing pipes, no one is dubbed, and everybody sings very well.  (Though again, Steiger might not have been up to the demands of ""Lonely Room,"" though he does a fine job on ""Poer Jud Is Daid"") It could be argued that these classic songs have never been better-sung then they are here, and the augmented original Robert Russell Bennett orchestrations are great.  Agnes de Mille recreates her original choreogrpahy to great effect; ""Kansas City"" still is amazing in how casually it comes out of the situation, ""The Farmer and the Cowman"" and ""Many a New Day"" are delightful, and  the famous ""Laurey Makes Up Her Mind"" dream ballet is still stunning.  Not the best R&H musical, (""Carousel"" and ""The King and I"" outclass it in story and score, and ""The King and I"" is probably a better film) but certainly one of the best film versions of one of their musicals with the makings of a highly entertaining evening for the whole family.  A fine tribute to a classic of musical theatre.",979862400,22,2794,5.021645021645021
206047,2,5554454828,"First things first: I love this movie -- start to finish. I love the show -- song for song. The performances here are magnificent, as is the movie-making. The whole thing is an absolute masterpiece.
But this DVD release is a major disappointment.
First and foremost, nowhere is the CinemaScope vs. Todd-AO issue mentioned. Knowing that there are two completely different versions of this movie -- filmed separately, edited differently -- but not knowing without some research which version I'm watching is completely unacceptable. (Now I know that it's the Todd-AO version on the disc.) I should be able to watch either version, or both side-by-side. (If you've never done this, try it. The two films are alarmingly different. And though the picture quality is much better in Todd-AO, the performances by the actors are significantly more relaxed and natural in the CinemaScope version. Setting technical aspects aside, without question I think the CinemaScope version is a much better, more gentle, movie. You really have to watch the two movies side-by-side simultaneously to see this, but a comprehensive DVD release would let you do just that and make up your own mind.)
Second, while watching this disc, there were times when it looked like it was originally shot on video tape! I think this is due to a bit of over-zealous addition of crispness, added to the already-crisp Todd-AO picture. It's a very strange experience which takes some getting used to.
Third, though the overture has been restored to the beginning, the opening credits are just still scans of the titles over a black background. What happened to the sweeping location shots which graced the original??
Fourth, the so-called extras are completely pitiful: one short trailer and three brief screens of ""production notes"". Some of the people who made this movie (like Shirley Jones) are still around, for goodness sake, and should be enlisted for commentaries and/or a making-of documentary.
In summary, buy this disc only if you're curious about the Todd-AO alternate version. If not, wait for the inevitable (I hope) de luxe release at some distant future date.

As a side note for SOUTH PACIFIC fans, the DVD of that film is much better than the THX laser, which had far too much color bleeding.
As someone interested in film history I'd like to see a special edition that includes both the TODD-AO and the Cinemascope versions of OKLAHOMA.  A comparison of cinematography and performances would be fascinating.
The musical does show its age in its sparse plot, but the music, and particularly the ballet sequence, make it still worth watching, as well as some of the performances.

I didn't hire the video until after I saw the musical performed on stage in the modest little town of Wangaratta, Victoria.  I loved the show, the music and the story, so naturally I thought I better check out the vid!
I think it actually works better on stage.  The actors were better able to gauge the audience's reactions and play on that.  Plus, they sang ""Oklahoma"" about five times due to the encores!
Of course the movie is also gorgeous though and I'm definitely gonna hire out more musicals from that era, and of that ilk.  It made me wish I was a local yokel living in Oklahoma... spending my days singing and trying to encourage the farmer and the cowman to get along!  The jokes are very cute.

206062,5,5554454828,"I loved the musical ""Oklahoma"" passionately as a youngster.  Then I took it for granted.  Then I forgot about it.  But now seeing it again at age 58, I have rediscovered its magic and vigor.  The Rodgers melodies and the Hammerstein lyrics are as magnificent and infectious as ever.  The skill of their compositions, the dialogue, the staging, acting, singing, etc., etc., make modern Broadway shows look amateurish and unimaginative in comparison.

R and H were geniuses of the musical theater.  In fact, they practically invented this distinctive genre.  However, to fully appreciate ""Oklahoma"" requires viewers to surrender themselves to the innocence and charm of a bygone era.  But once you do, you will be swept away by Rodgers and Hammerstein's masterful depiction of turn-of-the century Oklahoma.  And you will understand the reason that Rodgers and Hammerstein are rightly acknowledged as two of the finest artists America ever produced.  Successive generations continue to admire and perform their incomparable creations.  I doubt that we shall ever see the quality and longevity of careers as theirs in musicals again.  I am thankful that DVD's, CD's, and MP3's will preserve their work.  Our culture is forever enriched because of R and H's contributions.",960940800,,1267,5.27
206063,5,5554454828,"I just had to comment regarding the person who slammed Eddie Albert because he doesn't have a convincing Persian accent in the movie.
Talk about missing the point!  The character of the traveling salesman is  supposed to be a PHONY Persian!  He's supposed to be as Persian as Bill  Clinton!  An actor successfully playing the role uses a bad accent ON  PURPOSE.  The guy who played it in the original Broadway cast used  something close to a Yiddish accent.  If Eddie Albert's accent kept  changing throughout the movie, this does not mean he did a BAD job of  portraying the character.  It means he did a GOOD job.
The traveling  salesman in Oklahoma! is similar to Harold Hill in The Music Man -- he  travels around trying to gyp people in small towns by selling them phony  products -- one of them, in this case, being an Egyptian elixir.  Eddie  Albert played his role so well in this movie that 4 years later he was  selected to replace Robert Preston in the original Broadway run of The  Music Man.
While I'm worked up, someone else said he prefers the  CinemaScope version to the Todd-AO.  He says he realizes this puts him in  the minority.  I'll say!  The Todd-AO version is better in every way, shape  and form, and that's the only one that ever should have been shown to the  public, anyway.  The CinemaScope version is an anomaly of movie history.  The C-version looks brown and muddy.  The Todd-AO version is bright and  colorful.  I know ""brown and muddy"" is in style these days, and  ""bright and colorful"" is out, but ""bright and colorful""  is much more indicative of the musicals of the 1950s, and evidently was the  original intent of the filmmakers, and really SHOULD be the only version  available.  I have no nostalgic feelings for the C-version, which is the  only one I ever saw for 40 years.  Going from the C-version to the Todd-AO  is similar to going from Kansas to Oz -- everything turns to color!",958953600,10,1924,4.547058823529412

I have deciphered the various pieces of information,  and determined the following (1) original P&S video (not widescreen)  was based on the CinemaScope version, (2) laserdisc version was based on  Todd-AO version, (3) newer widescreen video was based on Todd-AO version,  and, the one that interested me the most, (4) DVD version was based on the  Todd-AO version.

Once I got past  the novelty of seeing the Todd-AO version for the first time I missed  hearing the lines delivered the ""old"" way!  I remember the  CinemaScope version actually began with a title card that said ""Color  by Technicolor"" while a full-bodied orchestra played the music to  ""There's a bright golden haze on the meadow""--an exhilarating  fanfare never to be heard on home video, as they have always substituted  the Todd-AO version's overture.
