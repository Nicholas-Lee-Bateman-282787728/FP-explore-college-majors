3802764,4,B001UL7L8W,"""Through My Eyes"" is a compelling documentary of the stories of gay youth/young adults who came to terms (and still coming to terms in some cases) with the struggle in our society of being gay and a Christian. Each individual recounts his or her own experiences of dicovering and acknowledging their homosexuality, often painfully, alonside the tenets of their faith they hold both dearly in the midst of internal conflict and rejection from members of their church, their friends and even family members.

Some of the experiences are difficult to watch; the stories are often told with a matter-of-fact style that upon reflection stir the viewer first with understanding and then oftentimes with the ramifications of what some of the featured individuals share. One of the most heart-breaking being one of the women interviewed sharing how when she was 8 her Sunday School teacher made a comment about a lesbian couple she saw as a group of young students went on a field trip. Now an adult, the interviewed individual reflects on the fact that incident was the one and only thing she retained from that Sunday School teacher.

Others, whether in a ministry-capacity in a church, people from urban and rural areas, whose faith influenced the path of their lives share similar stories of the self-hate, depression, long nights of secret tears, discouragement, rejection but also the beauty of reconciling oneself and the joy of forgiveness, a work in progress for anyone.

The broad spectrum of personalities in the documentary negate an easy assumption culture can have of creating a singular ""type"" of what it means to be gay or lesbian, the diversity of the gay (and Christian) community; of the glbt community as a whole.

While the productions values are low (but then again, look at Strand Releasing), listening to the poignant and sometimes funny personal journeys, you almost forget.

This documentary probably wouldn't play well with many Christians or churches, steeped in deep-rooted, though often misguided, traditions, but for those with an open mind, the desire to understand members of the Christian community who are courageous enough to share their stories.

One of the most extraordinary aspects of the film is that the subjects still pursue their faith, which could have easily been abandoned.

To those churches, youth groups or singles groups that do show the film, whether for understanding or as a cautionary tale, this film has the ability to reach out to possible viewers who may quietly and silently watch ""Through My Eyes"" in a group setting, but can take home the stories, the messages, and hopefully have for themselves this small light of hope that they are not alone in what they are going through. And for those individuals especially, this film has the ability to change their lives and have a unique place in the gay Christian community for them to call home.",1241913600,7,2893,5.014583333333333
3802765,5,B001UL7L8W,"This video provides an outstanding resource for churches to examine the issues of homosexuality within their congregations.  The people featured in this video could be youth in your church, people desperately seeking to follow God wherever He calls them.  This video does not attempt to tell you how to answer the question about homosexuality in your congregation; it introduces you to how young people in your church may be struggling to make sense of themselves as people trying to follow Jesus.",1238112000,6,497,5.1234567901234565
3802766,5,B001UL7L8W,"Truly amazing film about young people who are Christian, and have had to struggle with the question ""Why did God make me gay?""  Very powerful testamony as some recall family who threw them out of the house, and friends who turned their backs on them, all the while keeping God at the center of their lives.  A MUST for any church that wants to honestly deal with how one can be gay AND Christian.",1237248000,9,396,4.337837837837838
3802767,5,B001UL7L8W,"What's phenomenal about this documentary is that there is no narrator providing any kind of structure or background to it.  The people being interviewed simply speak from their experience -- their fears, their horror, their joys and their experiences good and bad.  And yet, it flows well together as a kind of tapestry of lives and held my attention throughout.

For Christians who are really interested in understanding what it's like to be a Christian (coming from a Christian home, growing up in church and all that) and realizing that you're gay, this is for you.",1237248000,15,568,4.895833333333333
3802768,5,B001UL7L8W,"I really enjoyed watching this video. There was no agenda, just heartfelt stories of gay people's varying experiences. Loved it!",1237075200,7,128,5.45
3802769,5,B001UL7L8W,"An amazing movie, and a great way to bridge the divide between gay christian community and the mainstream chruch. A total must see!",1236988800,12,131,4.739130434782608
3802770,5,B001UL7L8W,"""Through My Eyes"" is a must-see for all Christians who are serious about living out the Gospel as it paves the way for reflective dialog among those who are seeking to put into practice Christ's message to ""love one another as I have loved you.""  In this DVD, over two dozen Christians in their teens and twenties share their stories of what it means to be created in the image and likeness of God, who happen to have been born gay, and who long above all else to worship God with their entire being and desire that His holy and perfect will be done in their lives.

Not just a message for Christian communities who want to understand more of what it means to be Christian and gay, ""Through My Eyes"" is a testimony of the lives that Christ has changed through His love.  This video will enhance every church's library as it provides fruit for discussion among Sunday school classes, youth and adult ministries, and other groups searching for what it means to love without condition.

As a Christian who has struggled with being gay my entire life, this video has provided me with the voice(s) to share my faith with friends and family.  Like these ladies and gentlemen in the video, I didn't know how to reconcile being Christian and gay--mainly because I thought I was the only one.  I felt that I had to fix who I was by continually praying for God to change me.  I no longer feel that there is something that needs to be ""fixed"" because I now know nothing was broken in the first place; I was created in a manner exactly as God intended me to be.  I now realize that I'm not alone:  that there are others who are gay and have committed their lives to following the voice of the Good Shepherd by living out His message in our daily lives.",1236643200,50,1740,4.37888198757764
3802771,5,B001UL7L8W,"Through My Eyes is the first documentary I've seen that's only agenda is to ask people to listen. There are no ""this is what you should think"" or ""these people are wrong/right because..."" statements. It's just young Christians, who happen to be glbt, sharing their stories. A must see for any Christian!

3802772,4,B001UL7L8W,This was an extremely informative documentary about homosexuality in the Christian community and how they are treated. The feelings of isolation and profound sadness is shown throughout.  It does not portray Christians in a good light especially as we are supposed to be all about love; love for Christ and for each other.  How can we be of any use to our brothers and sisters if we fail at loving them?,1299196800,,403,4.661971830985915
3802773,4,B001UL7L8W,"Growing up fundamentalist I was taught to bloviate rather than listen. This documentary begs to be listened too. The lives represented are worthy of our respect and understanding. If you have a gay child, friend or loved one this DVD may help you to understand and become more accepting of the people that surround you everyday, if you listen.
My dad always said, ""Walk a mile in my shoes"". In this documentary you have a chance to just that.",1288742400,,442,4.6075949367088604
3802774,5,B001UL7L8W,"This is an excellent DVD which showcases Christian gay youth who have faced the truth about themselves, accepted that their sexual orientation is a gift from God, and are setting out to live committed Christian lives. It is wonderful to see and hear them speak so intelligently.",1279670400,2,278,4.9361702127659575
3802775,5,B001UL7L8W,"The most effective way to change people's attitudes towards homosexuals to be the same as those of Jesus is to actually see ordinary gays who really love the Lord tell their stories. This video does this particularly well and I strongly recommend it.

3802776,4,B001UL7L8W,"This truly is something that needs to be in every Christians'/every Gay person's/and every Church's DVD collection.  It's a heart warming story of the struggles of young Christian men and women who battle with compartmental lifestyle of being raised in a Christian home and dealing with homosexuality.

The documentary is presented in a very casual, interview kind of style, that portrays each 'character' in a very real and approachable manner.  Many individuals seemed to be at liberty to answer each question freely with only the flow of direction given by the interviewer.  It doesn't appear scripted at all but it does seem to be very genuine and has heart-felt stories about how the Church and 'Christians' on the whole have cast out these individuals solely based on sexual orientation.

This is a very short video but will leave you definitely wanting for more.  Pick up a copy and then pass it on.",1275091200,,906,4.927631578947368
3802777,5,B001UL7L8W,"First and foremost I want to say this... some organizations say ""everyone is welcome,"" and some mean it, some don't... The Gay Christian Network takes it to a whole new level. Everything they strive to do, they do in a spirit of unconditional love. You need to be involved with this organization regardless of your sexual orientation... it will radically change your life if you let it. I honestly can't make my experience fit in this text box, but I will tell you that if you are having ANY struggle with being LGBT, THAT IS THE PLACE YOU NEED TO BE!!!

Oh, and the video was amazing... in every sense of the word.",1270339200,,615,4.442477876106195
3802778,5,B001UL7L8W,I loved this DVD! It is a must have for any gay christian to show that there are more people in the world like us!  It opens your eyes to a whole other interpretation. You can love God and also be attracted to the opposite sex!  It's all about how you conduct yourself!,1266278400,,269,4.056603773584905

3802780,4,B001UL7L8W,"I was very pleased with this documentary/DVD!  It raised alot of good issues and concerns in the LGBT Christian community.  Not only were the thoughts and sentiments expressed most everything that a gay Christian such as myself has asked or wondered about, it also came with instructional information and ways to incorporate it into a classroom/Sunday school setting, which is exacting what our church plans on doing.
Where ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" touchs on theology and scriptural doctrine, ""Through My Eyes"" touches on the human aspect.  Putting faces of good Christian teens & young adults, going past the debates and realizing their struggle with what people have been told by mass religion their whole life.",1256256000,,716,5.102564102564102

3802783,5,B001UL7L8W,Purposely non-confrontational. Shows good diversity in the people that are interviewed. I am showing it at my Catholic church tomorrow night with the Deacon's permission. Great start to discussion on how we can make our GLBT brothers and sisters feel more welcome.,1250985600,,264,5.309523809523809
3802784,5,B001UL7L8W,"The DVD is simple and straightforward, and is of an appropriate length. It doesn't go into any detail about gay marriage or ex-gay ministry. Rather, it simply lets people tell important elements of their story. It has a broad appeal to a wide audience, because it does not stray into the area of doctrinal matters.

3802785,5,B001UL7L8W,"This excellent DVD should be widely viewed, by gays, non-gays, Christians and non-Christians.  It should especially be seen by parents, pastors and teachers.  The truthfulness and sincerity of the young people interviewed is apparent; and what they tell us about growing up gay in a straight culture (church and otherwise) ought to be seen and reflected upon as well by every person who has any concern for children, or for a humane society.",1246060800,4,441,5.027397260273973
3802786,5,B001UL7L8W,"This powerful documentary gets right to the heart of the issues facing Christians who happen to be gay. Done only using personal testimony (no interview questions) and lacking a soundtrack, the message comes across quite clearly; that these young people have found forgiveness and acceptance as gay Christians.

I wish there were more videos out there like this that show the true struggles and ostracization that gay Christians face, both from gay and Christian groups.

3802787,5,B001UL7L8W,"This is a wonderful documentary that is a must-see for all Christians today, regardless of their views on homosexuality.  This is because Through My Eyes shows us who the casualties of this ""war"" on homosexuality are - young Christians, trying to find their place in the world and seeking to keep Christ at the centre of their life.  Through My Eyes is emotional and engaging, and is a breath of fresh air for those who have walked a similar path.",1245542400,5,447,4.575
3802788,5,B001UL7L8W,I watched the movie and was in awe. I was able to connect with most of the stories that were shared in one way or another. It was a refreshing breath to hear people talk honestly about being a gay christian and all the struggles. I can't wait to see what else the creators behind this film have in store :),1245196800,,306,4.032786885245901
3802789,5,B001UL7L8W,"In it's simplistic and basic approach, ""Through My Eyes"" allows young, gay christians to share with the world their journeys of faith. To those used to typical documentaries, this isn't it. There is no narrator, special effects or music. The video editing is very basic. And in a way that's best. It leaves the watcher with no distractions.

The discussion portion of the DVD can come in very helpful for using the video for a class or small group. I would encourage anyone gay or straight seeking a first-person perspective on gay christians to purchase this film.",1245024000,2,565,4.824742268041237
3802790,5,B001UL7L8W,"This video of young gay Christians is heart breaking to say the least.  Our society needs to realise how painful it is for someone to find out that they are gay.  And, just because of this to be rejected by family and church is an almost unbearable burden.  It is time that attitudes changed, and the church realises that being gay is not a choice, and as such gay individuals should be welcomed in the same way as any other person who enters their doors.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Through-My-Eyes/dp/B001UL7L8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Through My Eyes</a>",1244678400,5,601,5.655555555555556

8344138,2,B001UL7L8W,"It wasn't the best-produced movie ever made. A lot of the filming came with background noises with amateur camcorders. It wasn't particularly that great. The names of the participants aren't used in any graphics. I've seen short documentary films that were produced in a more professional manner. This one, however, wasn't done so as much. Probably better suited for a school film project, but that's just me.",1495324800,,409,5.119402985074627
8344139,5,B001UL7L8W,I didn't know other gay people go through what I did till I saw this video. This video does an excellent job explaining what it means to be gay.,1422835200,,144,4.0

8344142,3,B001UL7L8W,"I chose only 3 stars in this rating as I felt this documentary didn't cover the whole story.  I appreciated so much that it was done without fanfare, in that it was done with a camcorder without special lighting or effects.  It was just real people, dealing with the real life issues of ""coming-out"".  While the documentary told the stories of all these different young people, it never came to any conclusion as to what these young people now believe or their feelings of acceptance within their own spiritual communities.
I would be very careful about sharing this documentary with ""newly-out"" families, or groups, especially in a church setting, that know little on the subject.  Pastors might be able to view this and use the stories as a foundation on which to build an educational program for their own Gay communities.",1380672000,2,825,4.829787234042553
8344143,5,B001UL7L8W,"If any one experience could touch the heart and open the mind of judgmental , fearful, ""religious"" folks in my church, I thought watching this video could do it. The video is well done and powerful, but no match for the hard heart of a truly self-righteous literal Bible reader. We bought two so we could circulate them more quickly before our church took the official vote to distance itself from those kind of people. Sadly fear, and self-righteousness prevailed in the hearts and minds of a two supermajority.
Through My Eyes did solidify my own growing discomfort with the attitudes and action of my fellow church members.
TODAY I FINALIZED WHAT I Should have done long ago. I WALKED OUT FOR THE FINAL TIME.
THE VIDEO WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THOSE WHO REFUSE TO WATCH IT.

8344145,4,B001UL7L8W,"This really makes you think.  No matter what your opinions or thoughts are about homosexuality, you can't help but listen to these young people and understand how hard it is to be gay and a Christian.  This should be watched by every pastor, youth leader and any person who hope to understand better what this struggle is all about - If for nothing else but to promote deeper thought and compassion about this issue.",1369094400,,416,4.608108108108108
