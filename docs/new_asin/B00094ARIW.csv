2266987,5,B00094ARIW,I have seen this movie when I was a kid and I decided to buy it again. Even tho it was more funny when I was little this movie is still funny just not as much. I still will watch it over and over,1348704000,,195,3.4545454545454546
2266988,5,B00094ARIW,A classic National Lampoon movie!  This one can be seen many times and it is still funny. A must have for people that enjoy comedy.,1285545600,,131,4.24
2266989,5,B00094ARIW,"Love this movie. it is hard to find but great to watch. So hokey that you have to laugh. Not for young kids but not really nasty, just silly. If you are a silly film person then this is for you.",1259539200,,194,3.7560975609756095
2266990,1,B00094ARIW,"What an unbelievably crappy John Hughes movie. There I said it. The storyline is boring, the high school looks like a set from a '30's Dracula movie and the actors should have been paid more for having to put up with such an unbelieveably stupid script. This goes to show all of us that just because a movie has the National Lampoon production credit doesn't mean a thing. Trading on Animal House's popularity, this movie does a great discredit to anything related to NatLamp. Gerrit Graham was great in Used Cars............in this fiasco he just sucked.

If you say you got some laughs from this movie you're either eight years old or have some issues with what is paraded about as ""comedy"". Save your money, save your time........or better off, buy an old issue of Nation Lampoon Magazine and get some real laughs.",1250208000,3,817,4.713286713286713
2266991,4,B00094ARIW,this is something remind me of my high school in the sixtys. this is good movie for being so corny butt it at least not big on lot of gore and has some little funny things that leave you  kinda in a good mood,1232928000,,208,3.727272727272727
2266992,3,B00094ARIW,"There isn't much memorable about this 1982 movie, but it was mildly enjoyable.  Zane Busby/Buzby as the possessed woman sticks out in my memory, though.  She was simply fantastic.  Hilariously snide at all times to her fellow class reunionists, and stealing the entire show at many points!  Her garish makeup job reminds me of Twisted Sister's move to the same outlandish, garish look in 83 and 84!  I wonder if there was an influence there?  I would see this movie again solely for a nostalgic revisit to her performance.",1208131200,,522,4.808988764044944
2266993,3,B00094ARIW,"Okay, my title sucks, but this movie doesn't. Lately, National Lampoon has released so many pieces of you-know-what that I doubted there were any good movies out there by them that I hadn't seen. Then I saw Class Reunion at a video store and noticed it was a.) not one of the millions being released this year and b.) written by John Hughes himself (responsible for the Lampoon's best besides Animal House, Vacation). I found it for a reasonable price here on Amazon, and it is hilarious. It's not at Animal House or even Vacation level, but it has many funny moments.
 The plot concerns a troubled man named Walter that was the butt of a cruel prank by the high school seniors, and now at the 10-year high school reunion, Walter has escaped from the loony bin to seek revenge. One of the best parts of the movie is recognizing all of the high school stereotypes, twisted gleefully by Hughes as he has done so many times (Weird Science, Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, the list goes on), like the preppy class president, the equally preppy prude, the blind girl (why not?), the guy no one remembers (Gary...something), the horny fat guy (played with gusto by Stephen ""Flounder"" Furst himself), and... the crippled chick that sold her soul to the Devil to be cured so now can produce fire. I remember someone like that at my high school, except she could produce ice.
 Anyway, for any Lampoon fans that weep for its future, look at this movie from its past and hope to God they can start making good movies again.",1185494400,,1513,4.5793357933579335

8057329,2,B00094ARIW,"Some movies are so bad that they are good.  This is not one of those.  There just weren't any laughs in it, and the actors seemed to be deliberately overplaying their characters, who were all stereotypes.  Too bad.",1467072000,,214,4.578947368421052

8057333,5,B00094ARIW,"From National Lampoon and screenwriter John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone) comes this ""very funny"" (Screen International) teen horror parody set in thehallowed halls of a boarded-up high school. Featuring Oscar-nominee* Michael Lerner, Class Reunion will make you scream and shake with laughter! It's been 10 years since Lizzie Borden High School's class of '72 graduated, and everyonethe preppies, the hippies and the in-crowdhas returned to reminisce over good times past. But classmate Walter Baylor has returned too with a vengeance! While the rest of the gang is misbehaving at its alma mater, Walter, who was amisunderstood freak then and a certified psychopath now, is still not over a prank played on him a decade ago and out to wreak havoc of a different sort! *1991: Supporting Actor, Barton Fink",1392854400,,821,5.2272727272727275
8057334,5,B00094ARIW,"Class Reunion so damn funny, typical National Lampoons Movie with a special apperance by Jaclyn Zeman of General Hospital and Chuck Berry",1370390400,,137,5.2727272727272725
8057335,3,B00094ARIW,"This early entry into the National Lampoon's Franchise is not a great one, but it is intentional. The storyline and spoofs reflect that fact that the actors themselves treat this movie like B-grade fare. But keep in mind it is intentional and only meant for an audience that will be drawn to such movie fare. So for cheap laughs and a sincere lackluster of any kind of seriousness, check out this movie. It is entertaining, but for that specific audience.",1368921600,,455,4.7
8057336,4,B00094ARIW,"good adult humor . I wish that national lampoon would do more movies like this
if i did not like it i would not have bought it",1364774400,,126,3.7037037037037037
