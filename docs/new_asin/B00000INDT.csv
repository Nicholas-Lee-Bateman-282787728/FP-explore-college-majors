7910931,2,B00000INDT,"This is the real thing.  The video does not consist of cartoons, puppets, theatrical reenactments, or images of still photographs.  THIS IS IT!!!  Every minute of the video consists of original footage, as one might find on the evening news.  The video starts out with a speech by J.F.K. regarding the space program.  This is followed by original footage from the Mercury and Gemini programs, with about one minute from the Apollo program, a subject found on another video of this series.  What we see mostly are closeups of the 1-man and 2-man space capsules of the Mercury and Gemini space programs, with commentary on the various rockets, e.g., Titan and Atlas.  Also shown is footage from the first ""space walk"" and from the various splashdowns.  But there are some disappointments.  I was hoping to see movies of Ham, the chimp, since I'd seen films of Ham on an episode of the History Channel.  Hence, the video being reviewed is somewhat spartan.  There are no interviews with astronauts and no Ham.  We are shown some engineers at the drawing board, with sketches of the Mercury capsule, but there are no interviews with any engineers.  The voice-over is not especially informative.  My 7-year old asked about the crane that flops down from the rocket, just prior to takeoff.  However, the commentary does not explain the function of this crane.  The narrative describes how all the power went out on the Faith 7 capsule, but seems not to explain how this problem came about.  The narrative describes the glowing particles in space seen from the Mercury capsules.  Was this phenomenon explained?  I don't recall so.  Certainly not in detail.  The narrator explains how 50 experiments were conducted aboard one of the Gemini capsules.  But the viewer is left hanging.  The narrator could have quickly recited the names of these experiments and, perhaps explained a few of them in detail, but this was not done.  At only 40 minutes, this video is not a bargain.  The producer didn't have to spend one penny in taking the original footage.  Why was ""International Video Corporation"" so stingy in this production.  One can only hope to find an answer by calling the number listed on the packaging (1-800-875-5000).  Cheesy ice skating music accompanies the entire video.  Even during J.F.K.'s speech, we hear the cheesy ice skating music.  How rude.  Even during the countdowns (""Five, four, three, two, one, ignition!!!"") we hear that cheesy ice skating music.  To conclude, this is a cheap production.  One can only hope that some day the History Channel, or a Ken Burns production, will offer for sale a production containing Ham the chimp, more details on problems encountered on the Mercury and Gemini missions, and perhaps interviews with the engineers.",1067731200,,2763,4.949891067538126
