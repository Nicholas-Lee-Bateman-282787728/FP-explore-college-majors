8744427,2,B01991ZKNW,"I hate to be so negative, but this is perhaps the worst documentary/series I've ever seen.  An important, interesting topic is taken and made into a boring, repetitive, slow-moving six episodes.  It's truly disappointing, because I was hoping to be able to show some of these to my sociology classes.

The price is great, but you get what you pay for.  Find something else to watch.  Trust me.",1462060800,,393,4.720588235294118
