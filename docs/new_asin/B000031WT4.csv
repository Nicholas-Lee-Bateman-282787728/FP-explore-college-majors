8208354,5,B000031WT4,"I may be considered too old (20) for kids TV, but hey, I say I'm in touch with my inner child. Ever since transformers, the cartoon world has been waiting for something to match it. At last Pokemon arrived! Its screenings  on ITV (UK) got me and my housemates out of bed and into the living room at  9:30 every Saurday morning. This set is the perfect way to begin your  Pokemon collection, chronicling the beginning of the adventures. I have to  say I'm not such a fan of graphic novels, but the videos and the swanky  case make this well worth the money. So go on; discover your inner child  and take this ideal first step towards catching 'em all!",962150400,6,650,4.330578512396694
8208355,4,B000031WT4,"The movies are the same as the ones you buy single but they are in a really cute case and come with a comic book also.  I thought 3 movies in the case w/comic book for thirty dollars was a good buy!  My daughter and  friends have enjoyed the movies, I figure Holiday Special can go for summer  vacation too!",961545600,,307,4.066666666666666
