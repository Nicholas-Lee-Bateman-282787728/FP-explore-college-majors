8229683,5,B000XTLYYE,Katherine's DVD is clear and professionally presented.  Her instruction of how to draw and then paint a poppy that pops has added to my knowledge and I am inspired by it.  I highly recommend her DVD.,1358726400,,199,4.5

8229687,5,B000XTLYYE,"Being a beginner to watercolors, this DVD made ALL the difference in the world.  Not only is Miss Katherine an amazing artist herself, she takes you step-by-step to create this gorgeous Poppy...and it really DOES ""pop"" if you follow her instructions.  I would highly recommend this to anyone yearning to learn the art of watercolor.  You will amaze yourself, truly, following Katherine's instructions, that you can create something this beautiful!!
