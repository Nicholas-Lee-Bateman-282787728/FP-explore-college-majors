8376238,2,B00008KIWV,"The quality of the footage shot for this video is fair-to-good; but a lot more of it should have wound up on the editting room floor. During one hunt, there's a good five straight minutes of camera just pointed at some scrub oaks, almost as if they forgot about filming deer. But, during another hunt, they show excerpts from what looked like five days of climbing and glassing, which I thought captured the difficulty of Coues deer hunting nicely.
Another interesting point is that they show the range for several of the shots the hunters take. Some are quite far, and they don't hesitate to include the misses or other embarassments. I respect the honesty of that.
Some of the hunts are interesting to watch, but they're far outweighed by continuous bits showing only slain deer and hunters talking about how great their outfitters have been. One guy moves the deer's head in time with what he's saying! (I would have cut that out.)
Maybe fifteen minutes (out of an hour) of the video is really worthwhile viewing, but for the price, I'd probably pass on this one.",1064448000,,1066,4.675531914893617
