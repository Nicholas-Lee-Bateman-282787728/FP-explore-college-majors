She communicates with the riders often.  I can't understand what the rider is saying when she has her back turned.  The first  half of the dvd had about 50 ""black spots"", where there is no picture.  The second half did not, nor did my first dvd.  You really have to want the information badly to get through it because of bad quality.",1500508800,,478,4.425287356321839
8427263,5,B004EPVU5G,"I bought them all - Thanks God!!! Still you do need a trainer, an experienced person on the ground. I am lucky, I have a Grad Prix level teacher who took clinics with Mary Wanless, and first suggested the book from her. But basically, this book will help you at minimum to better communicate with your trainer.
Another aspect, is why not to benefit from somebody's knowledge and skills instead of spending years of practicing wrong riding.
Most of the DVDs and books concentrate on training the horse, not training the rider. This DVDs will help you improve your position on the horse. Wary Wanless somehow has an ability to really explain how to ride properly, use the examples that will help you feel what you need to feel in your body when you ride.",1446595200,,752,4.5777777777777775

What to do with your leg, your seat, your core muscles is explicitly shown and totally supports what Mary Wanless says in her books. Great investment for me.",1362960000,2,291,4.615384615384615
