6992290,4,B00STPQ7SM,"Caught between a really nice, low budget Hollywoodesque movie, and a no budget bargain bin movie, 'Echoes' most certainly lives up to its very own tagline, ""The Truth Is A Nightmare."" Anna Parker (French) is having sleep paralysis nightmares, takes en masse of drugs to combat it, but fails most of the time. Either that or she stays awake through the entire night, too terrified to sleep. These unknown terrors in the night, which have been experienced by people across all cultures, have now given her writers block, as her publisher, Paul Wagner (Brand) is all too cocksure to point out.

Aside from the fact that they are also sleeping together, Wagner suggests they go out to Joshua Tree, where he has a getaway home there. She can relax, eat well, and they can be together. Then, perhaps, she can finally get the third reworking of her film script accomplished. Once there all seems well enough, until Wagner is called back to his office the next day and leaves Anna there to enjoy the time alone until he can come back for her in a few days time.

But the nightmares are ten fold now, the woman she keeps seeing getting more and more lifelike. Only one other man knows the secret of the Glass House that she now resides in, and he (Jeremy, played in methodical manner by Steve Hanks) is bound not to last long. The woman in her nightmares seems to be directing her, using her body, her mind to conduct some unfinished business; but 'Echoes' is not that kind of ""horror"" movie. In fact, Anchor Bay may well try and give you the whole 'Grudge' horror vibe to its marketing for this movie, but that photo on the back of the Blu ray/DVD doesn't even exist in the film!

Filmed on location at Joshua Tree, a census-designated place on State Route 62 in San Bernardino County, California, 'Echoes' is a slow burner, a suspenseful enough story, but nothing gets you involved until after the hour mark. The set up is long, drawn out. The actual ending, well, let's just say I was hoping for a lot better. But, that all said, the movie does get a lot of stuff right for the genre and director Nils Timm has definitely nailed the whole cinematic Joshua Tree dusty landscape as a film backdrop thing!

In closing, 'Echoes' is a very decent movie, slightly overcooked, but come that last half an hour and you are definitely invested in how it all plays out. Again, it all plays out a little rushed for my liking come the final ten minutes, no real answers are given to more than one question, the actual final closing scene a cop out, but the film is worthy of your time. In the opening scene, Anna is wearing a tshirt that bears the slogan No One Is Here ... which sums up perfectly those final, closing movie moments.

6992300,2,B00STPQ7SM,"Anna Parker (Kate French) is a blogger who desires to be screen play writer. She likes her booze and pills. She takes her pills, has bad dreams, and then takes another pill. Her boyfriend and agent Paul (Steven Brand) decides she needs to rewrite her draft and takes her away to the glass house in Joshua Tree, in what seems to be the new filming spot for films. While there, she meets the neighbor Jeremy (Steve Hanks) who lives nearby in a trailer. Anna's episodes escalate as things get weirder and secrets unveiled.

The film was rather boring as a horror thriller. The escalation of events didn't seem to be well thought out and didn't create the scare factor. At one point the sound track hinted at Native American drums, indicating the disruption of a sacred Indian burial site. But that was not the case. Sound tracks are suppose to enhance clues, not be red herrings. Of course during the whole thing you don't know how much of the story was real or Anna's imagination.  In fact PLOT SPOILER we still don't know at the end. Perhaps that is the ""clever"" feature of the film is that it offers no closure.

Rental at best.

6992305,3,B00STPQ7SM,"ECHOES is one of those curious films that I have a hard time defining.  Its part horror, part thriller, part mystery, and even part informative semi-documentary.  And yes, its entertaining for the most part to boot.  But with that being said, its not as enthralling as I wanted it to be.  From the hype I had heard about it, I was honestly expecting more.  Still, I do recommend it, although its less horror and more of a thriller.

I have to commend director Nils Timm for what has been accomplished with this debut.  From a production standpoint, the film looks great.  The cinematography is tight, the acting is top notch, and the film overall is well made.  The only lagging piece is the story.  Granted, its written well, but theres just something missing from it.

As I mentioned, ECHOES is shot well and is visually beautiful onscreen.  The desert scenery is amazing, and it really captures the desolate and lonely atmosphere the film is trying to portray.

Also, the acting is great, too, with Kate French and Steven Brand in the lead roles.  Ive watched both actors in prior works, and I have been impressed with everything Ive seen.  The supporting cast (as small as it is) does a fine job as well.

The story in ECHOES, however, just didn't excite me that much.  It had a couple of interesting portions, but I found it predictable and saw the big reveal coming from far off.  Dont get me wrong:  it is well paced and fleshed out for the most partbut its just lacking something, a specific spark of major interest.

Although I have reservations about the storyline, I still recommend ECHOES.  It is a slow-burn thriller that does keep you entertained, even if you can see whats coming from the start.  And I do hope to see more from director Nils Timm in the future.  ECHOES is available now in a variety of formats.",1429228800,2,1826,4.567901234567901
6992306,1,B00STPQ7SM,"Oh joy.  Another thriller that places an attractive young (white) female struggling with mental illness confronts a seemingly supernatural force while stuck in her boyfriend's house.  The world doesn't have quite enough of these yet.  The empty characters, predictable plot, and lame attempts at scares will leave you wondering, ""Why am I watching this"" right up until the end.",1429056000,,377,5.3559322033898304
6992307,4,B00STPQ7SM,"Great thriller, don't get the poster which presents it as a horror film. I have been missing watching a good psychological thriller, and without expecting it, this turned out to be one.

6992308,1,B00STPQ7SM,"Extremely dreadful thriller about a young female aspiring screenwriter and blogger suffering from sleep paralysis and frustration over the fact that her boyfriend/agent keeps returning drafts of her screenplay back to her with notes rather than submitting it to the studio.  Her agent/boyfriend comes up with the idea of taking her to spend some romantic time together in a glass house he owns in the desert.  The house is itself is the creepiest thing in the movie--why anyone would want to stay in a house that affords no privacy whatsoever in the middle of nowhere is more than a little hard to fathom--but maybe that's just me.

The agent is called back into the city for emergency meetings concerning another client so the easily spooked young writer decides to stay in the glass house by herself until her boyfriend takes care of the emergency in the city and can come back.  Predictably the easily spooked screenwriter gets spooked and thinks the place might be haunted.  Nothing that could be confused for suspense ensues.

Echoes is an hour and a half of non-stop tedium that never seems to decide if its heroine is crazy or if she's being possessed by an angry spirit when she sleeps or if the whole thing is just her terrible screenplay brought to life for us, the unfortunate audience.  The writing is extremely bad offering a mystery that makes little sense concerning a missing woman whose body should have been easy to find given the open terrain in the area surrounding the glass house and whose story likely would have turned up in the news even though the screenwriter can find no information about her disappearance online.  Wouldn't there have been a police investigation or are they going to just take the word of the husband that his blind wife walked off into the desert and simply never came back?

Echoes is extremely dumb and very dull, offering not even a single solitary cheap thrill to go with all the dopey psychodrama.  Writer/director Nils Timm probably should have done a little research on sleep paralysis at some point--it's not a condition where you would end up with a medicine cabinet full of pills for treatment.  The heroine of Echoes likely has much more serious underlying psychological problems but the movie only seems to be interested in sleep paralysis--probably because Timm thought sleep paralysis episodes would be really creepy on film.  They aren't.  Echoes is a movie that might put you to sleep but if it does consider yourself lucky.",1428710400,14,2487,4.851063829787234

6992310,5,B00STPQ7SM,"As someone who's had sleep paralysis many times I was really looking forward to this one, because there aren't many films about sleep paralysis. And they quite nailed that, although I wish there was more of it. It's a very scary situation not to know what is real and what not. I was quite surprised at the quality of acting and overall film making, because many times these smaller films feel cheap and have bad acting. Not this one. It feels very mature overall, with a very convincing cast (especially the lead Kate French) and a great look and atmosphere. The music and cinematography were outstanding. It had many moments I haven't seen before and the story kept me involved all the way until the end, which I didn't see coming. I guess some things confused me, but if you like a tense mystery that comes together like a puzzle this one does the job. It's not really a super gory horror film, but more of suspense thriller. And at that, the movie really works great and is quite unique.",1428451200,,991,4.511111111111111
