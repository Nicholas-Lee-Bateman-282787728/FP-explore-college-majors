2891121,1,B000SVRJ3W,"I'm not sure why I watched the whole thing. The plot is a little ridiculous. The cinematography is terrible. The dialog dreadful. It appears that the ""Americans"" are all wearing Italian uniforms. The Foley artist phoned it in. The best part was when the paratroopers were flying in for D-Day (at around 42:25) they were in a C-119. Unfortunately, the C-119 didn't make its initial flight until November 1947.

2891122,3,B000SVRJ3W,"fictionalized story about some French underground unit prior to D-Day.  Looked like some college students semester project.  Did not to justice to the actual sacrifices and efforts of the French resistance.  Decent effort, though.",1367193600,,230,5.705882352941177

2891124,5,B000SVRJ3W,"For fans of Euro-war movies this is a must have. It's not accurate(the American GI's wear Italian camo) but it is entertaining. Never let facts get in the way of a good story. The DVD itself is good quality even though it's a play only disc with no extra's or scene selection. These movies are hard to find, so, you have to tolerate some loss of picture quality.",1346889600,,362,4.338235294117647
2891125,1,B000SVRJ3W,"Oh what to say! Poorly dubbed, acting that reminds me of a school play, I only managed to stick it out for 30 minutes before throwing it in the bin. If you are looking for a DVD to use in a kids mobile or to round out the set of six funky coasters buy it. If you are planning on looking for a good war flick, find something else.",1344211200,4,329,3.782608695652174
2891126,5,B000SVRJ3W,"Obviously a foreign made picture. The dubbing and filming is
typical of these movies. But it's very well written, directed
and acted. The costumes and scenery are not cheaply done. It
has good pace and exciting from beginning to the end. It was
given to me cause they didn't like the video quality but I
grew up watching old late night movies so it looks okay to me.
This is a great nazi war movie that deserves a good quality
release on dvd in letterbox. I don't understand the garbage
they release and this can't get a decent one. I recommend
this to any fan of nazi war movies with a plot not just the
same old blood and guts john wayne story. ***** for movie.",1303603200,,663,4.26984126984127

2891128,1,B000SVRJ3W,"The movie was made by an Italian film company in 1968 and distributed under the following names ""Brigada suicida"" (Spain), ""Djavlspatrullen"" (Sweden), ""Helvetti on irti"" (Finland), ""Special Forces"" (unknown), and ""Tete de pont pour huit implacables"" (France).  The DVD seems to have been filmed from a camera in a move theater because the quality is so poor. Lots of dark shadows and just not up to the standards of today. And the dialog is very hard to understand. Great that Guy Madison was in it, but even the story is weak. Perhaps the original WWII film released by the government and incorporated into this film may be of some minor interest.",1189814400,3,648,4.837837837837838

But, this is an Italian low budget film from the tail end of the 60's, so you can't really go into this movie expecting Saving Private Ryan. (Speaking of great war movies, the opening sequence is ripped straight out of the film Battle of the Bulge, like not even pretending its an original idea ripped) What you do have with this is movie, is a not a half bad way to spend 90 minutes of your time, with enough gunfights to keep you at least mildly entertained.

2891356,2,B000SVRJ3W,"Terrible movie but do you know anything about the film? Perhaps a short review of the background may be helpful. Italian films that have been dubbed in American English are unable to convey the real emotions in the storyline . . . very noticeable in older films.

This was actually released in 1968 and directed by Alfonso Brescia. It isn't an American film and the audio is dubbed. Considering both the storyline and the timeline, it becomes a more interesting film. Films of this genre are usually difficult to find, are in another language or have subtitles. Knowing this information beforehand gives one a better perspective. If you enjoy the vintage WWII movies, it becomes an interesting commentary on European films and producers. The quality of the footage is grainy and slightly blurred and the audio is dated. Recommended for those interested in this genre and for those who are interested in learning.

2891358,2,B000SVRJ3W,Obviously a low budget film. Not all that interesting. I would not really recommend this movie to anyone.  Not worth the time.,1379721600,,126,4.7272727272727275

8206999,1,B000SVRJ3W,In my personal rating system a movie that I start and watch for a while and then just give up on gets one star. This movie was so bad that I lost interest about 40 minutes or so into it and just quit watching. Bad story. Bad filming. Bad dialogue. Nothing really plausible. Remind me a little of some of the Spaghetti Westerns but nowhere near as well done. Don't waste your time on this one.,1501891200,,392,4.171052631578948
