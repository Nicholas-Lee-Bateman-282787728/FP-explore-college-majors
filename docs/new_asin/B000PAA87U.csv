8189958,4,B000PAA87U,"Well, it is a Poe's story isn't it? music and dance are perfect creating a dark and somber mood. A very unknown Debussy, at last for me",1381276800,,135,4.037037037037037
8189959,3,B000PAA87U,"This dvd is NOT three separate ballets including the original scenarios for ""Faun"" and ""Jeux."" Rather, these two pieces of music underpin a ballet prologue peopled with characters from Poe's ""Usher,"" a one-act opera.

The story concerns ill-fated Roderick Usher, his sister Madeleine, his visiting Friend, and the attending Doctor. In the ballet, all three men are romantically attracted to Madeleine, but she is committed only to her degenerating brother. The choreography is just serviceable, not psychologically intriguing.

The best feature of this production is the set comprising tall dim shadowy windows, all on a great turntable offering multiple views.

The concluding opera (from a reconstituted score) involves the three men, real singers of course replacing the dancers. It's virtually a monologue for Roderick. Debussy is void of operatic talent, but these three singers do pretty damn good.

The Doctor tells the Friend that unbeknownst to Roderick, the sister has recently died of exhaustion and is concealed in the crypt under the house. At the end, though, through a window Roderick sees her hanging by the neck from a tree, a suicide. I waited for the house to fall, but the crew just turned the lights out.",1258761600,3,1225,5.2030456852791875
8189960,5,B000PAA87U,"It's not possible to over-praise this product, and it's a crime against art that fresh-from-the-factory copies are now (one fervently hopes temporarily) out of stock, only overpriced used copies. Even so, if you (a) love Debussy as the Second Coming of musical genius, (b) love clever ballet choreography, and (c) love dazzling, hyper-sophisticated stage and lighting effects, this is the DVD for you. Everything about it drips with professionalism -- save for one egregious (if minor) techno-hitch in the main menu. If you click on ""Prlude  l'Aprs-Midi d'un Faune"" you get ""Jeux"" and vice versa. A bit flummoxing at first until you rewire your neural circuits. But by the time you're safely in the music (courtesy of the Vienna Philharmonic and a first class little troupe of danceurs: two males and one ballerina) you'll have forgotten the confusing shuffle at the theater door. Hats, caps, and berets off to this A-Number One production, and shame shame shame on the Capriccio label for allowing this gem-of-gems of a music DVD to go out of stock. Beg borrow or steal to get yours.",1197417600,10,1084,4.988950276243094
