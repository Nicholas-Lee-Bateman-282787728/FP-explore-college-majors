4116018,4,B003EYEE42,"Filmed entirely in Pahurump and Betty, Nevada, this new film gives a unique perspective to the old horror concept. I enjoyed the stark dry scenery coupled with the ""real"" people feeling of a small town in the middle of nowhere...except you CAN drive there and see it.
This will be a great NEW movie for Halloween!

4116019,4,B003EYEE42,"Virtually all werewolf films are direct to DVD. I've seen nearly all of them. ""Dog Soldiers"" is the finest to date. This film was a pleasant surprise. First off the film quality is nice. This movie was worked on by dedicated professionals. You get a real sense of the setting. The lighting and sets were actually utilized. I've seen many unwatchable direct to DVD horror films, this film is watchable. The story is familiar. The Characters are good. The acting is competent. It gets points off because the sound effects were over the top. Bone crunching sounds were used even when a girl was slapped. The Werewolves were well done. They didn't have any transformation scenes really. However the suits were convincing and harkened back to the classic B-movie Werewolves. If your into ""Werewolf meets girl and is without his shirt for the rest of the story"" watch this movie. If your into MST3K nights with friends watch this movie. It did not disappoint. Ive watched over a hundred direct to DVD horror films. I'd watch this one again.",1327968000,,1034,4.782122905027933
4116020,5,B003EYEE42,"I've seen a lot of werewolf movies. Some great, some good, some pitiful. While this movie wasn't great, it was very well done for an indie. The acting was solid, the story was focused on a relationship that was impossible, yet one you routed for. As with all good stories, there was a substantial development and change of characters. We felt about them one way early in the film and felt quite different by the end. Billy Drago was refreshing in a good guy roll. Some characters that appeared to be bad guys early on, turned out to have some valid feelings for their actions and the reasons became evident by the end of the film. The effects weren't spectacular, ala, Werewolf in London and the Howling, but for an indie they were solid and effective. It was interesting that most of the main actors also acted as co-producers to the film. This indicates a strong belief in the film by the primary players. Not something you see often. I gave this film 5 stars because the story was good, the acting was believable and the development of was good. I found my self at the end of the movie, thinking, ""wow, that was pretty damned good."" Not really what I expected when I first began the film. I liked the homage to the earlier werewolf films, especially the original with Lon Chaney, Jr. It was clear that the producers/director cared about making a good story and a good time watching a traditional horror flick. Watch with an open mind. Take it for what it was intended to be and hopefully, you'll have a good movie experience.",1327104000,10,1528,4.51985559566787
4116021,3,B003EYEE42,"It's that time of year where Sid devotes the majority of his movie viewings to the horror genre, specifically B horror. Since we've been on a werewolf tear lately we randomly selected Wolf Moon to throw those things up there. Amazingly to our surprise the immortal Denton Vachs, know to the lame as Billy Drago, made quite the cameo appearance. We were shocked when we saw his creepy plastic looking face crawl on screen with that unmistakable sexual predator voice. Even more to our dismay, the fact that he survived his first decapitation in the critically acclaimed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;only to be decapitated again in Wolf Moon. The director must have been so impressed with that final Death Ring fight scene, yeah the one where Matt Collins lops of Vach's head with a sword, and said I need a Vachs style decapitation in my movie. Well it was a damn good choice, in fact one of the finest choices one could make. For a while we were hoping Drago would actually be the wolfman. Unfortunately he just turned out to be a dim whited hero that winds up getting his head pulled off.

Wolf Moon starts off so B that you almost shut if off thinking it's going to be similar to that of a d grade&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>&nbsp;quality. But be patient because it actually turns out to be a fair B grade effort. After the credits role we are introduced to our main lady whose hitting on the town's new mechanic with little success. This guy took a semester at the Dylan Mckay academy majoring in bad**s with a minor in pound town. For some reason he decides to apologize and the love ensues. They wind up become an item but becomes disrupted when her beau turns into a straight up wolfman. Turns out it was passed on to him from his dad who has been on a rampage killing everyone in sight. In between an inordinate amount of boring dialogue we learn he must kill his father to cure himself. Drago turns up tracking this wolf dad down while living out of the back of his van. Seriously he lives out of the back of his van. Didn't realize this movie was somewhat of a biography of Billy Drago's current living situation. In the end the ultimate wolf on wolf action begins with Drago getting his head ripped off and thrown while the wolf dad dies.

Once the credits rolled we were not sure exactly what to think. The beginning was entertaining and the ending was awesome, but the middle was so drawn out to the extent of pure boredom. The biggest 3 star contributing factor was the screen time of B movie legend Denton Vachs aka Billy Drago. Anytime this guys is on-screen you are just drawn to every last confusing ounce of dialogue he spews out. He's a guaranteed 2 stars just by showing his mug for more then 5 minutes. Besides that when these guys were werewolves they looked sweet. Especially when we witnessed a fantastic wolfman vs wolfman battle royal in the end. If Wolf Moon would have been shortened down to an hour this would have earned a 4 to 4.5 stars for sure. The middle yapping was just way too long. The brothers Sid would have spaced out for some Arnold pranks and snack demolishing on an epic Thursday. So really it's a run of the mill B horror that deserves a watch, but nothing more then that.",1317427200,2,3453,4.860780984719864
4116022,2,B003EYEE42,"WOLF MOON is 124 minutes long, about 50 minutes too long.  Endless panoramic vistas and unmemorable ""original"" pop songs try to compensate for the lackluster script, the flaccid direction, the listless acting, and the hilarious special effects.
Obviously an attempt to lure TWILIGHT fans with its doomed love story, WOLF MOON is ultimately tiresome and tedious.  Its predictable climax is limp and uninspired.  Shame on Max Ryan, Maria Conchita Alonso, Chris Mulkey, Billy Drago and Sid Haig--they've all done better!
Not recommended.",1302998400,,534,5.487804878048781

4116024,5,B003EYEE42,I think they did a great job on this movie.  All the original thoughts were incorporated here.  Great special effects.  I will definately be watching it again!,1282089600,,159,4.814814814814815
4116025,1,B003EYEE42,"Firstly, kudos to Robert F. Powers for writing an honest review.  Here goes another one not written by a buddy of the film makers...(If you want to see more, go to the movie's IMDb page and click ""External reviews"" - this is getting trashed net-wide, ergo they sent their buds here so unsuspecting folks like me would buy their muck, but I digress)

Where is a wad of steel wool and some bleach when you need them?  That's what I wanted to do to my eyes after about half of this gigantic turd of a movie.  My God, where do I even start?  Script = trite, cliche rubbish that's been done to death and back (and much better) by other writers and directors with a heck of a lot more talent than this one.

Acting = man, everyone phoned this one in.  I have no idea how they even got some of the cast (though the slew of co-producer creds gives a clue) but from where I sat it looked like they signed up for what they thought was going to be cool, then realized they signed on to utter garbage and knew it wasn't going to get any better.  No one has their heart in this at all.  And when the actors seem bored within a movie, you know that you, the audience member, are not far behind.  I was ready to turn this off after half an hour but wanted to give it its fair trial, so to speak, so I stuck it out.  All mind-numbing 124 minutes of it.  Really?  Do we need that long to tell a story that's been told thousands of times already?  Allow me to answer.  No.

Cinematography = how many shots of a full moon do you need to show us, pal??  We get it.  There's a werewolf on the cover, it's called Wolf MOON......Hello?  We get it.  Pan down to something interesting, ok?  And the static ""effect"" in the flashback.........words can't even touch how infuriating that is.  I thought my DVD was broken, but alas, I fear that this is this film makers' idea of ""artistic"".

The SPFX could have been very good if they had the cash to get something good.  Face it, materials cost money.  Good materials cost more money.  And so on.  This movie suffers greatly from the ""too much money in film makers' pockets and not enough on screen"" syndrome.

I was able to look up the budget on IMDb and it says they spent 3 million bucks on this.  Where???  Darned if I could tell.  This one was even thin on camp value.  Even the presence of the always entertaining Billy Drago as the psycho cop couldn't make this one bearable!  I've seen all the leads (save for the two newcomers - the male of which should never be allowed in front of a camera again) in many other movies, and far better ones at that, and I've enjoyed them all at some time or another (or many times), but in this?  I couldn't even like seeing those familiar faces because the movie they're buried in is that bad.  Just that bad.

Avoid this one, go buy Twilight: New Moon (since that is the movie this one wanted to be anyway) or The Wolfman.  At least with them you'll get some good effects and a little bang for your buck.  Leave Wolf Moon out on the porch.",1279843200,2,3005,4.197898423817864
4116026,4,B003EYEE42,"A direct to dvd film that actually faires better then Neowolf.

What you have is a love story, not a bad trope to use... a Family Curse where Father and Son duke it out with each other in the end.

The transformation scene is done well, reminds me a bit of Oz from Buffy the Vampire Slayer when they'd show him in his werewolf form. It's smooth the transition, not like the depiction of slighty hairy wolf with Klingon Brow Ridges found in Neowolf.

So son's a drifter, falls in love, Daddy comes along wanting to get his son to act properly like a werewolf to revel in the kill and blood.

There's dry parts with the acting and predictable at times. Yet its still very watchable and a good flick.",1279584000,,697,4.297709923664122
4116027,2,B003EYEE42,"""Wolf Moon"" is so dangerously close to being completely stupid, but it turns out that is its charm.  What is it about lycanthropes that makes a girl's heart flutter?  Is it the hairy palms? Baying at the moon after sex?  Turns out there are two werewolves, father and son.  Son slaughters the horses and Dad slaughters the humans who ride them.  Even trade off.

The female sheriff of the town is so clueless she has a hard time finding her way from one room to another never mind solving the problem of the mutilations. The role is played by Maria Conchita Alonso who was once an up and coming actress but has now gone the way of plumpness and looks as if she divides her time eating Tacos and appearing in direct-to-video crap. Her deputy is a hulking lug who happens to be the father of the girl who loses her heart to the werewolf. Dad's against the inter-species relationship. Go figure.

The movie has nowhere to go really and the finale is a father-son showdown between dad and boy and Billy Drago as a werewolf hunter. Billy Drago looks like a werewolf without make-up.

i had to give this movie at least two stars because of its silliness and the God-awful werewolf make-up.  I've seen kittens that were scarier.",1278201600,4,1221,4.513636363636364
4116028,4,B003EYEE42,"Seeing this at the ""High Desert Shorts Internaional Film and Music Festival V"", I was impressed how the story was generated and carried thru. The lighting techniques used were done very well and when the ""wolf"" appeared, was done excellent. The tranformation was flawless and done with great taste (Oh, do wolfs taste?) The movie had a flavor of earlier horror flicks from years ago, and give this a rating of B+.",1275177600,6,413,4.75

8395722,4,B003EYEE42,"I watched to trailer for this movie on Amazon Prime and decided it might be worth a look. It also didn't hurt that Lionsgate is the studio that put it out and in my opinion they have had more hits than misses. It has a pretty good story line and while most of the cast are relative unknowns there are a couple of well known names in the cast although to be fair they are pretty much past their prime. Still, the cast does a pretty good job and the story moves along nicely. It's basically a werewolf story with a twist and you can tell the studio opted to save some special effect money by not showing the actual transformations back and forth. All in all it's a pretty good movie and if you're in to horror and particularly werewolf stories then check it out.",1372982400,2,760,4.212328767123288
8395723,3,B003EYEE42,"I first stumbled upon this film 6 months ago, and because I knew I was going to be moving to Pahrump, coincidence of all coincidences, I got to watch a film made in my soon-to-be new home town.

Pahrump is not like any other town you can think of. You basically come here with whatever expectations you might have and they immediately get turned inside out. So if I were to make a statement...as an outsider...like ""Maria Conchita Alonso is completely unbelievable as the town ""Sheriff""...well, once you set foot in town, you might run into a gun-totin', protectin' and servin' Sheriff who looks just like her. Just take anything you expect and flip it to the opposite and you have a good ""beginner's introduction"" to the town.

Looks like everybody in the film grabbed a producers' credit, which means they starred in it, and they kicked in some bucks as well. There's perpetually ber-Creepy Billy Drago (perhaps best known as Frank Nitti in Brian DePalma's classic ""The Untouchables), there's ""Captain Spaulding"" from Rob Zombie's films, Sid Haig, who basically stops by to drop some f-bombs and be Sid Haig, there's Alonso, who's seen better days (maube botox, maybe plastic surgery, maybe a little of both, but she's not looking that great and her acting is forced and wooden).

It's really not worth wrapping our head around the ""story"" in this one...rival werewolves who just happen to be father and son, a local girl who discovers that she likes her men pouty, fanged, and covered in a luxurious coat of fur, locals (including Haig) who fill the CLASSIC role from the old Frankenstein flicks of ""the angry villagers,"" a sort of moody, boogie-blues soundtrack that ain't half bad...

It's campy fun, and it bears the distinction of being filmed in a town most people don't know about. Watching Billy Drago walk out of the public library is kind of trippy. So are some of his other scenes, but I won't spoil them for you. Let's just say that he doesn't get the girl and live happily ever after.

So the premise of my three-star review is ""you could do a lot worse."" If you like trashy ""midnight movies,"" you will probably like this. I enjoyed it. But rest assured, George Romero, John Carpenter, and Tobe Hooper didn't lose any sleep over this film's release.",1358035200,,2264,4.7360406091370555
8395724,1,B003EYEE42,This has to be one of the worst movies ever made.  Not even the lovely Maria Conchita Alonso could save it as she has done to so many others.  It really is unbelievable and horrible.,1338595200,,182,4.171428571428572
8395725,4,B003EYEE42,"Imagine a very low budget Twilight without vampires. A father and son share a curse of being a werewolf. The father (Max Ryan) kills people while his son (Chris Divecchio) kills animals. The pair do not know each other. Dan, the son, drifts into a small town and falls in love with Amy (Ninja Cheerleader Ginny Weirick), whose dad (Chris Mulkey) does not approve of his daughter dating werewolves. Seems Washington is more progressive than Texas in mixed marriages. Billy Drago is an unkempt investigator who knows their secrets.

The movie was originally released as ""Dark Moon Rising"" and normally retitled films tend to be stinkers. This one has a certain ""pew"" factor to it due to its lack of budget and having to use cheap guerrilla costumes with rubber werewolf masks. Ginny Weirick has a number of weak scenes and the film would have been better off with a different lead. Horror movie favorite Sid Haig plays a small role and is for the most part ""normal"" as normal as I have seen him in a film.

This is certainly not the worse low budget horror film out there. It feels like it was made in the 1970's due to the lack of technology in the film. Worth a peek if you like cheap entertainment.

Sex, Nudity, F-bombs (Hey! Sid Haig is in it.)",1333411200,3,1247,4.533333333333333
