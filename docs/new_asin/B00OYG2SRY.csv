If you like watching the same G Scale trains going past the same lighted buildings, then you'll love this.  If not, you can shut it off after the first 5 minutes.  The music isn't Christmasy.

The story is supposed to be about the village of Christmasville and the people who live there.  Then, ""The Last Train"" must fight through a big snowstorm to deliver presents to the village.  However, during the big ""snowstorm"" on Christmas Eve, there are all kinds of trains running, not just ""The Last Train"".  And, the big ""snowstorm"" is nothing but smoke that is blown in front of the camera.  A little falling SOMETHING during these scenes would have been a big plus!

The story mentions a lady who lives on a hill, but the train never goes up any grades.  And, for a company that produces train videos as its business, you'd think they would know to use manual focus on their ""from the train"" videos.  You can plainly see the auto focus attempting to get things clear as the camera car is pushed around the village.  A lot of the video is very grainy, especially in the darkened (nighttime/early morning) scenes.

And, the story specifically mentions that the train is carrying Christmas packages, but none are ever shown.  However, two box cars advertising beer are featured throughout.  (And this is supposed to be for kids??????)

On the plus side, the Department 56 buildings are nice.  And, there are A LOT of figures in the village.

If you decide to buy this video despite what I've told you, at least watch it before you show it to your kids or grandkids and make up an ""I Spy"" list so that they have things to look for.  That will help to keep them occupied.  There are several animals, names on the buildings, crates on a flat car, log cars that they could count, and other things that you could write down for them to try to find.  However, be aware that the same trains go around and around and AROUND AND AROUND, passing the SAME buildings and people over and over and OVER AND OVER, so they'll probably have seen everything within the first 5 or 10 minutes of the 30 minute video.",1424217600,,2236,4.54
