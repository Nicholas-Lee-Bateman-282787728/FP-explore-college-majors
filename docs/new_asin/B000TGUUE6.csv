2901316,5,B000TGUUE6,"Great workout!  You will need a strong arms and chest to support your body weight and strong core for these movements. This is also very good training for coordination and flexibility. I love the mixture of quick powerful exercises and stretching.

I've been working with several good DVDs for Power and Ashtanga yoga and I have a background in Taekwondo and kickboxing.  So I thought that it would be no problem to just pick this up quickly.  Although poses like crow, side plank and pidgeon are very familiar, what is a floating Brazilian, playing monkey, or a fighting crocodile?  Many movements are more grappling oriented.

Plan to spend time mastering the individual moves with the instructional portion of the video.  Learning during the workout is complicated by the fact that you are moving so much that you depend almost totally on the audio cuing. Unlike slower yoga workouts, you can't watch the video and do these moves. I've had to progress gradually through the video.  Each time I do the workout to the point I know and then learn the next one or two moves in the instructional part gradually increasing the size of the workout.

I would also suggest adding some stretching to your routine after the initial mediation and before the rest of the workout.  A few sun salutations and some hip streches will help flexibility with during the initial part of the workout. Kung Fu stretches and Pigeon come later on in the video, but I find that I need that stretching earlier on.",1269216000,2,1489,4.7587548638132295
2901317,5,B000TGUUE6,"I'm a certified yoga instructor who was looking for ways to put a little more excitement into my own practice. I love yoga, but have an athletic background and that part of me needs to get fed, as with probably most people.
I checked out the Budokon series and am thoroughly impressed.
Mind you, this is NOT for everyone, you must be humble enough to watch the instructional portion more than a few time to get the different  movements - Floating Brazilian, Dancing Dog, Fighting Crocodile, Fighting and Playing Monkey. Once you learn the subtle keys to these flowing poses you will find yourself moving and feeling like a kid again.
You also have to have patience - I'm pretty sure there are people who can do the entire routine at once, but for most of us, it takes building up to.
It's taken me six months to master almost all of the moves, albeit not perfectly, but like yoga, Budokon is a journey to be enjoyed, and one which will transform your body and mind.",1235520000,3,965,4.482954545454546
2901318,5,B000TGUUE6,"This program (all 3 DVD's) is a great tool for anyone who is already in good shape and wants to be in awesome condition.

I use these DVD's to supplement my MMA training.  Even after 4 years of BJJ and Muay Thai, plus 15 years of staying in shape with conventional fitness routines, this program manages to be exceptionally hard.

The routines in the program are rather unique;  they utilize muscles in ways you probably haven't used them before.

Bottom line:  if you are already in decent shape, this will help you get in the best shape of your life.  If you're a beginner, I would still recommend trying them out.  Nothing says you have to be as fast as Cameron Shayne and do every repetition.",1232496000,6,696,4.468253968253968

To be quite honest I wasn't ready for Budokon but I thought it was worth a try. This is a combination of martial arts, yoga and meditation. Instead of holding each position the postures ""roll"" together in a way that is similar to vinyasa-style yoga. The difference is that with Budokon you are alternating action-packed moves with relaxing stretches.

The practice begins with a five-minute breathing session to calm the mind and body. While this tests your patience it prepares your mind for the highly disciplined style of exercise. You need a completely centered mind to follow the cueing, which is fast and furious. The names of the postures give some indication of what you will experience. Some of the exercises and postures include:

Plank
Downward Facing Dog
Upward Facing Dog
Child's Pose
Side Plank
Dancer's Bridge - takes you from side plank to facing the ceiling
Floating Lunges - jumping from one side to the other
Crow - an intense challenge for the upper body where your entire weight rests on your arms
Kung Fu Stretches - a simple side to side movement to stretch out the legs
Downward Facing Lion
Dancing Lion
Pigeon
Fighting Monkey
Playing Monkey
Kicks
Leaping Leopard
Crocodile
Gorilla
Flowering Lotus
Plough

To complete the exercises you need to have a basic knowledge of yoga and good upper body strength. Your body also needs to be trained to respond instantly to the cueing. If you have a good idea of what to expect it makes everything slightly easier to accomplish. The technique tutorials are a good place to start if you are new to Budokon.

If you are looking for a highly disciplined style of exercise, then Budokon might be something you want to try. This rigorous workout puts the body through a strenuous series of flowing exercises that will leave you energized with a sense of clarity. The practice ends with an extended meditation.

2901320,5,B000TGUUE6,"Budokon, Power and Agility is definitely  an innovative and unique fitness program that has touched 'home' with me. I study yoga, martial arts and when I need to, meditate. As a person who practices both yoga and martial arts, I was looking for a program that synthesizes both disciplines and this DVD accomplishes this tremendously. It contains both a complete, uninterrupted workout and comes with a tutorial for the myriad of different exercises, both yogic and martial art related. As one who has taken seminars with Cameron Shayne, I must encourage others, too and this DVD gives you an opportunity to learn this splendid art called Budokon. Mr. Shayne is wonderful hands-on teacher, both powerful and humble in his approach. This DVD in a three-DVD series will improve your power and agility, your strength, balance and your flexibility and flow.  You will be rediscover and inner athleticism desiring to be developed. I have been practicing all three DVDs (Power and Agility, Strength and Balance and Flow and Flexibility) and must honestly admit that in so many ways my physical abilities and my mental state have improved markedly. Budokon necessitates a strong body/mind thought process that has a synergistic effect on you. Not many yoga/physical fitness DVDs open and close with a meditation like these new Budokon DVDs do.",1192406400,18,1335,5.1192660550458715
2901321,5,B000TGUUE6,"just like the other two dvds he has...this one is just great, too. whoever heard about his class and hasn't taken it, must do so immediately. you won't regret it. i took the class and now own all 3 DVDs. you should too...",1190851200,2,221,4.162790697674419

8209438,4,B000TGUUE6,This whole Budokon series is great!  Nicely produced and some extra elements within the customizable menus as well as the breakdown tutorials that make these dvds high quality.  Overall a great way to get some excellent conditioning for either Budokon primary series or any other yoga practice.,1496620800,,294,5.23404255319149
8209439,5,B000TGUUE6,"As other reviewers mention, you have to ""work up"" to being able to perform all moves on this dvd, and make it through the workout in its entirety. I love it because of that. Too many workout dvds seem very simple and don't work enough muscle groups or encourage growth mentally and physically. This dvd is tougher than the strength/balance yellow dvd. So I break this one out when I'm feeling brave, and have been focusing on yoga enough to handle the flexibility and endurance. Sometimes I don't make it all the way through, and literally lay on the ground and just watch while he does some of the crazy moves. Its a build up and its totally worth it. Great challenge!",1447545600,,669,4.491803278688525

8209447,5,B000TGUUE6,"Since the other reviewers did a great job summarizing the DVD, I mainly just wanted to share my experience. First of all, after reading a few reviews stating that you should already be a good shape to try this, I was reluctant to purchase it. Therefore, I found that it was available on Netflix, and after reading even more frightening reviews about apparently fit people getting their butts kicked by these videos, I decided to give it a try. Surprisingly, it wasn't quite as scary as those reviews led me to think.

Now, you should know that this review is coming from someone whose primary sources of exercise have been running, bicycling, and yoga. However, before today, an upsetting amount of months had passed by where I can't say I did anything I would consider serious physical activity.

I have never practiced martial arts before in my life, but in starting the DVD, I saw many familiar yoga positions being used, particularly during the warm up. This was a definite comfort. As the routine really kicked into gear, I had difficulty figuring out what body parts to put where and in what order--but the DVD includes a fabulous feature, allowing you to view the tutorial for each specific move, then returning you right where you left off in the main video. This helped tremendously. Still, I am far from as fit as I could be, and I know that my execution of the moves wasn't close to perfect. Currently, I lack the muscle control necessary to ""float"", as several moves demand, but I still felt I was gaining knowledge and the feel of what should be done...and, though I know I didn't look graceful in the slightest, I could feel both my muscles and my stamina being tested.

There are also areas in the routine that combine a few different moves together. These I had more trouble with. My solution was to slowly go through the parts I knew while the instructor was still speeding through them on screen, and looking to him for clues to the transitions I wasn't sure of.  No, I didn't end up doing as many repetitions or accomplishing them as quickly, but I did start to get the hang of it.
Toward the end of the video, my energy began to seriously wane, but I did what I could and pulled through.

Overall, I enjoyed the DVD. I found Budokon to be an exhilarating change of exercise technique. No, I did not master it on my first try, but if it was that simple, what would be the point in doing it? I just want to let those of you out there who are interested, but wary that you aren't ""in-shape enough"" to try it yet, that it's really worth it. Like any other new routine, it takes time and repetition to follow along seamlessly (and to gain the necessary vitality!), but it's a challenge that I am eager to take on (as I intend to purchase my own copy now). I loved the combination of slow stretches with the other fast-paced movements. It brought in what I already enjoyed about yoga, but gave me something that I believe will eventually help me gain the energy I am hoping for.",1279411200,23,2992,4.482568807339449
