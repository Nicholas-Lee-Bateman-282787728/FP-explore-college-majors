8550544,4,B00AEG07R6,"One of the most fascinating creatures on the planet is the snake. ABC's World of Discovery takes us through several adventures involving these mysterious & often feared animals to show up close and personal, a snake's way of life. Ranging from the rainforest of the Amazon to track the deadly Fer-De-Lance Pit Viper, to the streets of India where 'snake charmers' show us Indian Cobras, and to Texas, U.S.A., where a 'Rattlesnake Round-Up' brings in huge amounts of North America's most common poisonous snakes. It tells us why the snake is so universally feared as well as the fact that a lot of man's fears surrounding these creatures are unfounded. This one is narrated by the late E.G. Marshall ('Superman II', 'Chicago Hope' TV series). Although this documentary is more than 20 years old, it's still a very fascinating & informative program.",1474329600,,847,4.971830985915493
