5102545,1,B007P3Q9P0,"I am sickened that my name is associated with these entitled boors. However, my incredibly intelligent and lovely girlfriend is fond of watching these kine bumble through meticulously formulaic plots and deprecate their gender. I post this 1 star review in mute protest.",1361232000,2,270,5.3023255813953485

5102557,1,B007P3Q9P0,"These episodes do not play. They only come up as reconnecting. Even after all updates on my computer, this same messages continues to appear. What a waste of money.",1404086400,,164,4.689655172413793

5102559,5,B007P3Q9P0,"This is a beautiful family inside and out.  they support and love each other through good times and bad.  Kris is an amazing mom.  The strength in the girls is testament to that.  And God love Bruce for putting up with this female  stronghold!  I don't know why people are so critical of them, as they bare it all for the world to see.  They work hard, play hard, and have just as many difficult family problems as any family.  If anything,  their story is inspiring to one who wants to pursue a dream, start a business or learn about how to support their own family during times of need.  I think people who judge are possibly deeply unhappy with their own life.  No amount of money makes your life easy or perfect.  They are good people with heart and soul.  You will be hooked, but start with season 1!",1394841600,,805,4.286666666666667
5102560,1,B007P3Q9P0,These morons have no talent whatsoever and owe me a refund and more!  I am recommending therapy for anyone who would watch this s***!,1394064000,4,133,4.541666666666667
5102561,5,B007P3Q9P0,"I liked watching tis season of the Kardashians, too. I sort of felt sorry for Bruce through out all of the episodes,,,he really had not much control of anything. I would love to spend a week with this family, just to get to know them a little. I only knew what I had read in magazines and on TMZ, I would like to keep watching their show, though my family laughed at me for doing so, i really don't care, they were interesting and I feel that they love each other through all of it...I think it would be difficult to be filmed on a day to day basis and I'm sure alot of their lives are embellished and that they have to make it that way to keep it interesting.",1389139200,,660,4.0458015267175576
5102562,1,B007P3Q9P0,I am disappointed that the last episode of this season was not included in this purchase! This was a rip off!,1389052800,2,109,4.238095238095238
5102563,5,B007P3Q9P0,"There is absolutely no socially redeeming value to the Kardashians, so why are we all obsessed with keeping up with them? I watch this show with my 23 year old daughter; we see ourselves in this family (minus the unlimited money, devastatingly good looks, and couture clothing, of course). Kris is a workaholic trying to keep her chicks in/close to the nest. Bruce is laid back, easy going, and just wants to golf. Kourtney is trying to turn a Bad Boy into a Good Man. Kim is looking for the impossible love. Khloe is the life of the party, just a down to earth girl. Rob is putting off growing up and taking responsibilty as long as possible. Kendall and Kylie are growing into their own personalities, and will no doubt cause as much public commotion as their older sisters. Who can't relate to this family? They are the everyday, run of the mill family, they just have great stylists. This is a terrific mother daughter show; my daughter and I laugh out loud, cuss Scott, point to each other when someone does the exact thing we always do, and we realize family is family no matter what your circumstances.",1388793600,4,1109,4.55
5102564,5,B007P3Q9P0,"I love this whole family!  I don't care what everyone else thinks of them, I love them.  If all these people thought that this familt was so bad, the ratings wouldn't be where they are.",1387152000,,185,4.257142857142857
5102565,3,B007P3Q9P0,The show is alright. Some episodes are better than others however I'm somehow addicted. Although I have to say after a few seasons I am now thinking this family isn't so bad as everyone portrays. Yeah they think they fancy but whatever if we had the money they did we'd probably be doing a lot of the same ;),1384041600,,308,4.237288135593221
5102566,5,B007P3Q9P0,Love the kardashians! but probably is doesnt worth the money since you can get all the seasons online for free... :(,1381190400,,116,4.571428571428571
5102567,5,B007P3Q9P0,Can never stop watching once I get started good reality tv show... their personalities remind me of my family at times,1376179200,3,118,4.666666666666667
5102568,1,B007P3Q9P0,"I watched this season AND the next season, and I'm so ashamed of myself.  The only thing redeeming about this series is baby Mason...so cute.",1373587200,2,141,4.64
8520130,1,B007P3Q9P0,my daughter snuck this and i would never approve it. I think its vapid.  Not hating on the family just really really don't care.,1526515200,,128,4.333333333333333

8520134,2,B007P3Q9P0,"Meh. Maybe the later seasons are better but if I'm gonna watch reality television, It might as well be entertaining",1478649600,,115,4.8
8520135,4,B007P3Q9P0,"I like the Kardashians. Even with all the drudgery, arguments and conceitedness, they are a family. They teach us that no matter what life throws at you, family always comes first.

I have been Keeping up with the Kardashians and I do not regret it <3",1473292800,,251,4.456521739130435
8520136,5,B007P3Q9P0,Content is great but sound is not consistent.  Music blasts to the point you are holding the remote the whole time turning it up and down.,1471651200,,138,4.3076923076923075
