8090355,5,B000BP50XG,Martin vs Lasorda. Reggie! Reggie!  This would be a great tape for Yankee fans to have.  I love to see that third home run by Jackson when he hit the knuckle ball of Burt Hooton way out in straight away center.  Not only three straight home runs in the same game but he did it on consecutive pitches.  Is there any doubt why they called him Mr. October?!,1207440000,39,354,4.161764705882353
