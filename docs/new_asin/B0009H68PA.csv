8060615,5,B0009H68PA,although other reviewers didn't like the fact the butterflies were cg images I didn't mind this at all. Beautiful images and scenery. As for personal preference in the musis family prefers either the nature sounds only or no sound. We didn't enjoy the music chosen -- but this is a matter of personal taste.,1475971200,,307,4.703703703703703
8060616,1,B0009H68PA,Do not buy it. It is to artificial with bad Photoshop butterflies and the colors is to busy.,1466640000,,92,4.166666666666667
8060617,5,B0009H68PA,"My Mom L-O-V-E-S butterflies, so I gave this to her as a gift.  I was concerned because other reviewers said it was CG.  It doesn't matter.  My Mom says she keeps this on in the background everyday and that she finds watching the butterflies peaceful.  She also likes the Music ON/OFF feature and says that sometimes she has the music playing because she finds it enjoyable as well.  So overall, I would say this is the perfect gift for the (non-Lepidopterist) butterfly-lover in your life!",1395619200,2,490,4.7176470588235295

8060619,5,B0009H68PA,Great DVD.  Prefer it to regular TV.  Fast shipping.  Would buy from this seller again.  Very happy!,1268092800,,100,4.705882352941177
8060620,5,B0009H68PA,"I used this DVD for the video backdrop of a presentation that I produced for an awakening seminar.  The colors were absolutely perfect!  I will use this DVD as the backdrop for any type of entertaining that my partner and I will do in our home, because it has a very animated feel without being a cartoon.  It offers beauty and serenity at the same time.  I highly recommend it.  You will not be disappointed.",1206230400,,409,4.4
8060621,1,B0009H68PA,"I rented this by mail. It wasn't described as a screen saver, but that is a very good description. Computer-generated butterflies, a CG waterfall, superimposed on a Photoshopped hill of blossoms. Very two-dimensional visuals, annoying music (not soothing or relaxing). Nothing ""living"" about it.",1201478400,5,295,5.7272727272727275
