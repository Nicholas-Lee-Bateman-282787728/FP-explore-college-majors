The movie was actually suspenseful and enjoyable.  The acting was pretty good and the premise of a cult/militia group is new and a relatively untouched topic in the movie world.  The beginning of the movie is quite mockable due to some ""what just happened?"" scenes but they are still entertaining.  To be a little technical, I would say that the group is less of a militia group and more of a vigilante group.  One other reviewer points out that the movie is liberal propaganda because it shows what could be perceived as right wing extremism in the US, however, I did not detect any such subliminal message at any point in the movie.  The premise of vigilantism makes for very good TV in my opinion and this movie does a good job portraying it and the individuals who commit it.",1477180800,,920,4.446428571428571

If you want John Wayne and Green Berets, this is not the film for you.  This is the quality of the film, 12 Angry Men.  The film takes place in a small northwestern town in the US where a group of men made a decision to issue justice on their terms when a person was let free on a legal technicality.  They have continued to do the same, feeling it was their duty for their fellow citizens.  However, the ones who started the group have grown older and their sons are expected to take up the cause.  The interaction between father and sons, duty and loyalty to a cause, etc that begins to make one of them to question this concept and the responsibility for their actions. Others in the film may have thought about what they are doing whether  it is right, but do not cross that line. They only remain silent.  I do not want to spoil the plot, but it is a decision that one should never have to make, but how many of us would make the right decision, and accept the responsibility for their actions.  This film makes you think about choices people make and causes they would be willing fight for and carry on or simply accept in silence.  History is fraught with individuals who simply do not want to rock the boat or accept actions of others in silence.  This film won four international film awards in 2012 because of the narrative and justifiably so.  Well worth a watch.",1400198400,4,1529,4.249134948096886
