8557026,3,B00ARVRCW6,"When William Powell underwent some personal problems and withdrew from acting for a while, the studio, eager to continue the Thin Man money train, tried out a couple alternative ""married detective"" pairs.  This movie, starring Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell, would have gone on to spawn a whole series, had it been a hit.  But it wasn't.  Compared to ""The Thin Man"", it has shortcomings.  Douglas and Blondell have pretty good chemistry, and both (Blondell especially) put their heart into it, but their bickering seems mean-spirited compared to Powell and Loy's; and Blondell's character vacillates between nitwitted and clever; it's hard to describe, but the script doesn't really respect the character.  It's shame; a little more polishing of the script, and this could've been big.
However, it's still a perfectly good movie; the mystery makes sense, there are a few good moments, Joan Blondell is charming when the script allows her to be, and it has all the professional craftsmanship you see in a big-studio production.",1475452800,2,1028,5.168674698795181

8557033,4,B00ARVRCW6,"Melvyn Douglas has left his job as a detective to start his own agency, with his wife, Joan Blondell, as partner.  Trouble is, they're broke.  This is a brisk comedy, played at breakneck pace, with Blondell stealing the show, perky and mischievous, locking horns with the disgruntled Douglas, who has returned to work for the DA's office.  Mary Astor plays a client in distress who seeks the services of Douglas' agency, only Douglas has left to rejoin the DA, and so Blondell takes her $300 advance, and promises to do some snooping for her on a potentially cheating husband.  This includes dragging a hesitant Douglas to a nightclub for some funny and very overt snooping, without his knowledge.  The next thing you know, Astor is mixed up in a murder.  The dialogue is very snappy, the action very brisk, although some of the give and take between Blondell and Douglas gets a bit stretched at times, and the sleuthing is a bit hard to follow.  Hey, who thought Melvyn Douglas could do comedy?  A cute farce.",1394841600,7,1010,4.698863636363637
