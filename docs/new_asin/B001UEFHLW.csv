The reason for the low rating is, I ordered another copy as a gift for my father on father's day, but it would not play on either his DVD player or his computer. I had him send it to me, and it works fine on my equipment. I suspect there is a compatibility problem with some players.

It's my favorite DVD, but as a gift for someone else it wouldn't play at all.",1373673600,,498,4.071428571428571

8343472,5,B001UEFHLW,"I had previously purchased TD's ""Live at the Tempodrome in Berlin"" (Original Recording) and had barely finished viewing it when I logged back in to Amazon and ordered the Orange Odyssey DVD. Although the cinematography isn't quite as good as the first DVD, it is still quite good; I think the requirements of the laser lighting effects may have required a bit less than the degree of lighting needed for the best filming. Iris Camaa was her usual smiling animated self as she displayed her mastery of percussion, and the band just showed how much they enjoy performing in front of an audience. This is another ""Must Have"" concert video from TD! The concert started out with my favorite song ""Girl on the Stairs"" and just kept getting better, and when they did Jimi Hendrix's ""Purple Haze"" for an encore the talent of the guitarists really showed (the audience didn't quite know how to react, at first, I don't think they were quite expecting to hear a Jimi Hendrix tune!).
  I hope they tour North America sometime soon, I will definitely be buying tickets to see them.",1274918400,5,1069,4.711229946524064
8343473,5,B001UEFHLW,"I have been a TD fan since 1976. I really like the selection of tracks on this DVD. If you like Dream Sequence, Oasis and Booster Albums then Orange Odyssey is for you! A good mix of older and recent tracks. The video editing of the concert is ok. I will be watching this DVD over and over!

The only negative that I can say is that the disk itself had problems playing on a couple of my DVD players.",1246147200,5,400,4.0
