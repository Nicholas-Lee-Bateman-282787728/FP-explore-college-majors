sell more movies of her. Some I can't find. There is one in particular I want. It is called Giving up the Ghost. She
acted in it with her husband Alan Rosenberg.",1353888000,,264,4.0
7860250,4,6304071647,"I thought this movie moved at a good pace with some action, mystery and a twist at the end that I did not realize was coming until a few minutes before they unloaded it on me. There is some nudity in this movie but it helps to develop the romantic storyline and makes the twist at the end more dramatic.",1282348800,3,303,4.066666666666666
7860251,4,6304071647,Marg Helgenberger in an earlier role (CSI currently).  You definitely get to see 'a lot' of Marg (adult material definitely - murder and sexual encounter).  Not for children but very suspenseful and exciting!,1218412800,4,208,5.2727272727272725
7860252,4,6304071647,I wasn't expecting much out of this movie but was pleasantly surprised with the plot and the acting.  It certainly held my attention and I was surprised by the story went.  It is also a great choice for anyone who wants to see more of Marg Helgenberger because you definately see more of her here!,1066953600,14,297,4.381818181818182
