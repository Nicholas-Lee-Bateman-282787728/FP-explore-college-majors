4665126,4,B005EBOSO4,"These DVDs were used by my wife who is a licensed massage therapist.  She was able to expand her repertoire and bring more immediate relief to her clients.

She says ... ""Awesome.  Very explanatory.  User Friendly and so easy to implement and use the techniques.""

She eagerly awaits the lower body installment in the series.",1363996800,11,325,4.836363636363636
4665127,5,B005EBOSO4,"I am a physical therapist and this video is, hands down, one of the most informative and educational tools for any therapist to have in their library.  The video is very well done and easy to follow.  The screen is split for a lot of the techniques making it very easy to see hand placement. The instructor repeats himself and the technique so there is no need to rewind or slow the video down.  I know when I attend continuing education courses, I leave wishing I would have been able to video or record the course as you do tend to forget some things when you return to the clinic.  This video is an excellent resource and I highly recommend it to all of my collegues!",1326153600,24,670,4.2936507936507935

8468116,4,B005EBOSO4,"Exceptionally clear explanations and demonstrations.  A great teacher with a wealth of knowledge.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that, as good as the techniques are, he seems to imply that muscle energy techniques are the answer to virtually all osseous dysfunction without at least mentioning that there are other very useful modalities that deal with fascial, movement training and other associated issues.  I do hightly recommend, especially to bodyworks who specialize in specific therapeutic work, but would be a bit mechanistic for someone who does primarily massage work or works at a spa, although the understanding behind the techniques is really fantastic and can't help but improve anyone's work either for understanding boney articulations or as an adjunct to other modalities.",1440892800,5,799,5.376

8468120,5,B005EBOSO4,This is an amazing educational video. The production is beyond first rate. The teaching and very clear  visuals of anatomy and direction of force make this otherwise difficult subject very approachable. I'm studying these videos prior to attending Tom Ockler's courses. These are hands down the best educational video I have ever seen.,1424908800,5,335,5.320754716981132
