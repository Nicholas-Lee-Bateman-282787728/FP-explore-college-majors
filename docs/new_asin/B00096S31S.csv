The quality of these movies are terrible though - they only provide a full screen version that cuts off stuff on the screen, despite trying different display options.  I knew the first couple of Gamera movies were in black & white, but they are so 'washed out' that I can't even enjoy them.  My son loves watching Godzilla movies with me, but I couldn't get him to watch for more than 10 minutes or so, which I don't think was because the content, but instead due to the poor quality...

I guess you get what you pay for!",1178323200,4,632,4.198347107438017
2267835,3,B00096S31S,Three classic Gamera films collected on one disc in poor quality. Spend your money on the excellent Shout Factory releases instead!,1130457600,32,131,5.285714285714286
2267836,4,B00096S31S,"My 5 year old son loves everything Godzilla or any monsters right around that time.  He enjoyed this movie although he got bored waiting for the monsters to show up in the beginning.  Since the movie is old, the color and picture quality is not that great.  But if you're anything like my son, you will truly enjoy it!",1126828800,6,318,4.3559322033898304
2267837,4,B00096S31S,"I give this collection four stars

because of the great price - if you're

not a hardcore kaiju collector - or

even if you are - you're not gonna beat

the great price.  The movies themselves

are classic ""B"" status and earn about

three stars each.  The movies are presented

in full screen with English dubbing.

As for the movies, they include Gamera's

1st, 2nd and 4th movies (but are placed

on the disc out of order for some reason.)

Anyway, the movies are all intertaining;

my personal favorite being War of the

Monsters, Gamera's second movie.

The box also contains some nice interior

notes about the films (a consideration many

collections such as this omit) and a great

black & white fold out of the big Turtle

himself.  I was delighted with this

purchase - recommended!

P.S - For any Speed Racer fans out there,

you might be interested in knowing that several old

Gamera and Godzilla flicks had English voices from

members of Speed's show. You can sit and say to

yourself ""hey, thats Trixie's voice or that's Speed!""

I always prefere original scores and sound tracks, but

at least the English is made more fun to listen too:)",1126137600,16,1154,4.601990049751244
