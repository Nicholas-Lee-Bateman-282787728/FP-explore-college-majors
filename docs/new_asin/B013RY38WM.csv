8728628,2,B013RY38WM,"I was told that this DVD was in NTSC format, Which uncommon for band like Eisbrecher, but when i got the DVD, to my disappointment, i got a PAL DVD instead. I would have loved to have watched this DVD, but all this DVD serves is an incentive to get a region free DVD player.  I had high hopes. I truly believed that Metropolis Records, the U.S distributor for Eisbrecher, made NTSC copies for their American fans. Had i known that this was a PAL DVD, like most of my favorite bands from Germany, That aren't Rammstein, i wouldn't have bought it in the first place. I would have been so pleased to have given this a 5 star, but it merits 2-star because i feel gypped. Next time, Amazon, post the correct format like you did for the Blu-Ray.",1490054400,,739,4.2785714285714285
8728629,5,B013RY38WM,"I bought a region free blu ray.  Just a little advice for anyone who buys the region free blu ray version of this, it will NOT play in a PS3.  I didn't have trouble playing it in a blu ray player, though.  Again I did not order this exact Eisbrecher blu ray, I bought a region free version.  The advice I am giving is ONLY for the region free blu ray, of this.  I hope this helps someone else who decides to get overly excited that you were able to find a region free one, only to get it and realize it does NOT play in a PS3.  I had to go out and buy a blu ray player, just for this blu ray.  I will keep the blu ray player, in case I get other region free blu rays from other countries, especially if they have PAL format.  The PAL format is what kept it from playing on the PS3 but worked fine in the blu ray. Again, I do not know about this particular one, that is region locked but figured this was as good a place as any to give information on Eisbrecher Shock live.",1471132800,,972,3.8737373737373737
