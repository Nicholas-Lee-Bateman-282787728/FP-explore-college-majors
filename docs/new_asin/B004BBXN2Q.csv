4315164,5,B004BBXN2Q,"This has to be one of the best bargains of any product I have ever bought. Absolutely brilliant, British drama at its best. It starts off quite crass, lurid, dirty, almost shocking... and whilst it keeps it up pretty much relentlessly, there is a great deal of depth and sadness if you choose to notice it. Very, very funny too. Not for everyone, but absolutely brilliant for me!

I look forward to seeing the next (and final) 7 series in a box set too.....?",1367539200,,458,4.4523809523809526

4315167,5,B004BBXN2Q,"Now watching this set for the second time,  a brilliant comment on society, not only in Britain but world wide!  Very Very funny but be prepared to be shocked!  The characters will become part of your life.",1349222400,,206,4.513513513513513
4315168,5,B004BBXN2Q,"I live in the US, where only season 1 of the UK Shameless is available for rent/purchase.  I fell in love with the show and took a risk buying this box set, but it paid off!  The DVDs are coded for a different region, so if you want to watch it in the US you'll need to change your DVD player's region code (or software to rip off the code itself).  I recommend using an external hard drive since you can only change your region code so many times.  Another option would be to buy a cheap DVD player if you've got $30 to spare.

At any rate, this show is fantastic and you CAN play it in the US if you can figure out how to change your region code.  Love the show!",1325721600,3,664,3.917910447761194
4315169,5,B004BBXN2Q,"A fascinating seven years series. It is a real time series One season corresponds to one year, and yet most of the series is situated in the 1980s, under Margaret Thatcher and with the community jobs she introduced for claimants though one character at the very end of the seventh season sees the future and all the characters envisioned in that nightmare die in 2010. The time line seems to be warped.

First Frank, a claimant. He probably had a future in grammar school, but one day he voyeuristically discovered the intercourse between two boy and girl students. From this moment onward he only had one objective in life: that small death of instant pleasure in the meeting of a man and a woman and the necessary objective of procreating, nearly all his life because at the end of the seventh season that objective has eroded tremendously.

Then he could have no other social objective and he did not try to. He became a claimant and his whole life was built on a great number (eight or nine) children that enabled him to be provided with a council house and a fair amount of survival money. Not enough maybe but the children were systematically encouraged to find their own finances. This poor sorry character develops a severe addiction to alcohol and drugs, nothing but the ""pills"" of any color. He also supplements his income with stealing, or borrowing without the intention of giving back, trying to talk people into paying his beer, etc. In one words a perfect unpleasant character.

His children, some at least, leave the home to go away as far as possible. The last over sixteen girl chooses Afghanistan. It is more difficult for the boys who are under strong pressure to be the slaves of the father just as much as the girls who have all run away after a while. The eldest son disappears rather fast leaving a child behind him with the daughter of the second family in the neighborhood. The next two develop different personalities. One is gay and the other one is strongly antigay. The pressure put on the gay one will eventually turn him away from his own genre and make him steal the girl friend of the other who is quite brutal and domineering, declared as the right one who is able to take him away from a temporary erring gay choice. This is a dominant discourse: the whole series: is deeply homophobic.

The second family is Paddy's, an Irish Catholic Mafioso that racketeers the whole neighborhood. The daughter will be impregnated by the next door eldest son but there will be no marriage. The three sons are all different. The eldest comes out of prison, marries the girl of one pf Frank's procreating partners and becomes the local publican. He is apparently impotent and the girl will get impregnated by a violent bully who will rape her one afternoon. The second son is at first rather mentally disturbed but he finally falls in love with and marries a local easy lady in the shady house at the street corner. But children are out due to her decision. The third one is obviously exclusively gay, though entirely in the closet for his family and the neighborhood. No child here either but his total instability prevents any regular partner, not even the next door gay son.

The third family is the Pakistani local store's owners. The husband, father of two, will initiate the gay son of the first family at the age of fifteen and then will have to disappear to evade his embezzling. The mother will take the shop over and will find it difficult to establish a relation with one of the local cops and her children. She will manage to solve the first problem and to elope with him after selling the store to the brutal rapist.

A few questions emerge.

First the humor is heftily packed. It is typically British and has to do with many marital ambiguities, old spinsters hungry for males, or females, many scatological situations with all types of exhausts, rejects and wastes from every single character. They even have the gay plumber, the gay cop, the bisexual erotic DVD producer, etc. They don't forget shady ladies and all kinds of flagellations, leather ladies, ponies, old babies in crawlers and rompers. The only missing thing is the desert island and marooned shipwreck survivor. But religions, particularly Catholicism, are an easy target especially with the Pakistani store family.

Socially it is very conservative, but the English way. Behaviorism is the rule: you are what your family makes you and as long as you stay with it you have to follow the necessary compulsory pattern. The only salvation comes from a quick exit, as soon as you can, at 16, hardly later. The main example of this family dictatorship is visible with Frank's wife, the main woman in his life who goes away twice, the first time with a lesbian truck-driver she will bring back and the second time alone, after six children (one with another man) before her first departure and another child between the two departures. During the first absence Frank produces twins with another woman, the mother of the girl who marries the publican and who has enjoyed intercourse with Frank her own mother's boyfriend. After the second departure Frank manages to find another woman to exploit, along with her own crippled mother.

The seventh season ends up in some very bleak complicated violence and blood shedding, the ex-gay son of the first family ending up killing the brutal rapist who tried to elope with the publican's wife and her son who is also his DNA-proved son. It is so intricate and dark that even an owl would not see the smallest mouse in that mess. Good luck for a continuation because the business is far from being concluded.

4315170,5,B004BBXN2Q,"For anyone who hasn't had first hand experience of life on an English ""Estate"", this might take some getting used to.  However, given time, you'll soon become obsessed by this unashamedly naked look at real life on the Chatswood Estate.  Full of humour, pathos, sex of every creed, compassion, camaraderie and much more, this series is priceless. For the cost, it's worth giving it a try.  If you find it too close to the knuckle, pass it onto someone less squeamish.",1308960000,,467,4.7407407407407405
4315171,5,B004BBXN2Q,"My husband and I are both completely hooked on Shameless! Like the reviewer above, I bought an all-region DVD player just to watch this series. We're nearly through the 7 seasons in just 3 months, often watching 3 episodes in a row. The writing and the acting are both superb. David Threlfall as Frank is exceptional.... what a complex character! He's useless as a parent, a sloppy falling-down, foul-mouthed drunk, consistently unemployed, and a terrible role model for his children, yet there is something inherently likeable about him. And if you can understand his diatribes through the slurring, Frank is actually intelligent and well-read, though it's not obvious at first. The rest of the cast are brilliant too, and it's interesting to watch the kids grow up over several seasons. There are frequent new additions as some of the original cast leave for various reasons, and there's really no weak link here.

I'm American and I have not been using the subtitles. At first you'll sometimes miss parts of the dialogue but very quickly you'll get used to the accent and you'll be able to understand them without the subtitles. (in some cases they don't do much good anyway....for example, I had to have a UK friend explain to me that ""six well ten"" means 6:00 UNTIL 10:00!)

One caveat: not for the kiddies!! Even younger teenagers might find it a bit shocking. LOTS of rude language, LOTS of sex, and very frank (no pun intended) discussion of the particulars thereof.",1301529600,17,1474,4.868525896414343
4315172,5,B004BBXN2Q,"I have given up hope that Channel 4 will release the rest of Shameless (2-7) under USA Region 1 format.
The series is so good (I've seen seasons 1-4), though, that it was worth it to me to spend an additional $80 on a multi-region DVD player just to watch this one series. If it works out, I'll be able to order more British formatted disks.
Of course, I haven't recieved either order yet, so I'll review the DVD player once my order shows up...",1301270400,4,445,4.247058823529412
8421869,3,B004BBXN2Q,"The first cpuple of seasons were fine, but as I watched further into the show the disks started freezing and skipping really bad. Now on season 7 and have to frequently pause every episode because the disk lags/skips and the character voices go out of sync with their mouths. I know I haven't damaged the disks because it happens even on the first disk of a season, taken right out of the just opened case. I like watching this show but it sucks that I can't even make it through one episode without pausing and waiting several times.",1529020800,,534,4.459183673469388
8421870,5,B004BBXN2Q,This show is unbelievable its my favorite ever I'm thrilled to have the first 7 seasons. I binge watched it on Netflix a week later I was missing them all so much I had to order it! Everybody in the cast is amazing. The music is wonderful.its non stop crazy I was warned and didn't believe it.

8421877,5,B004BBXN2Q,This is the original British series and I found it to be funny from start to finish. It's absurd fun and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. The family changes make up during this run which doesn't trap the writers into rehashing old story lines. The only one that I truly miss is Debbie but that is just lust for a pretty girl that grew into a gorgeous young woman.,1425168000,,370,4.225352112676056
