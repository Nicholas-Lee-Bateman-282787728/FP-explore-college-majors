7664363,5,B01BN1BREW,"This is a first class professional film with English subtitles(the dialog is mostly in Russian, of course). How often do we get to see a ballet comedy? As far as I can recall, this is the first one. It takes place in 1986 which was a time of transition in Russia and near the end of the USSR. The story centers around Boris, a rather strange ballet student who seems not to fit in with the other students or the teachers. There is a girl who likes him but he does not like and the girl he likes doesn't pay much attention to him. He has no friends in the school, it seems. His only friend is his partner in black marketeering, which becomes an interesting story element later on. Boris never knew who his father was so he becomes fascinated with Baryshnikov and begins to believe that he must be his son, especially since people say he looks like him(I don't see any resemblance). Interestingly, once he believes that, he becomes infused with self confidence and becomes a much better dancer, at least for a while(his pirouettes certainly improved, but little else). There are also interesting family relationships that the movie deals with, along with the problems of life in the USSR. This is a movie that no balletomane should miss! There is, however, one big problem: the disc will not play in most players! It would not play in my Sony 3D Blu-ray payer nor would it play in my Toshiba DVD player. It does play on my computer using either PowerDVD or VLC Media Player. In the VLC Media Player I was able to get the information on the disc format: it is an MPEG disc. That is why it won't play in many players, although some players do play it.(Actually, my players do play MPEGs but not this one for some reason; not all MPEGs are created equal; it certainly would be easier if it weren't an MPEG; standard DVD uses some of the MPEG standards but not all.) Since this is manufactured on demand by Amazon.com, I blame Amazon for not making this clear and furthermore, for not helping the producer by suggesting that it should be transformed to standard DVD which is very easy, actually. Amazon is paid to produce this and they should have done a better job.",1459814400,4,2160,4.470886075949367

8750745,4,B01BN1BREW,"Really cute movie, decent acting, and well done.  The ending isn't exactly what you are expecting through the film, but it's not unfulfilling either.
Unfortunately the Manufacture on Demand of this disc, like someone else mentioned, doesn't work well at all.  I'm not very technical but its in a weird format that most DVD players don't read.  My dvd/blu ray player said it was a blank disc.  My PS3 said it was in PAL format.  My old DVD player wouldn't read anything.  I had to insert it into my laptop and connect to the TV via HDMI cable to watch.  It was quite frustrating and I don't understand why they couldn't format it properly.  I've purchased other MOD discs from Amazon previously and there was no issues.",1492473600,,718,4.5984251968503935

8750748,5,B01BN1BREW,"My (Russian) wife and I both enjoyed this movie tremendously. It is poignant yet comedic and subversive at the same time. The costuming and setting were beautifully detailed and of the period. The main character was a star, who was supported in his effort by an excellent script. The ending surprised us both. Many will agree that small films on the big screen can be the most powerfully moving of all.",1484956800,,402,4.676056338028169

8750753,4,B01BN1BREW,"The russian Billy Elliott? Well, not exactly, but perhaps more delightfully surprising and unexpected though. The star of this Russian romp, the young Dmitri Viskubenko, is a comic genius! He has the comic physicality of Keaton and Chaplin, and effortlessly exudes a timing and maturity that continuously delights and surprises. Oh, and he is funny, deadpanning with the doe eyes of a faun, soaking up every last ray of light and energy and delivering heartwarming vibes. The supporting adult members of the cast are fine, but this film is truly a showcase for the young, and talented  Viskubenko. Highly recommended.",1482537600,4,617,5.17
8750754,5,B01BN1BREW,"Fun, sweet movie. In spite of what some reviewers have said, it *does* have English subtitles. If you're watching on a computer, move your cursor to the upper righthand corner of your screen and click on the icon that looks like a speech bubble. You'll be able to turn on the subtitles there (you can also adjust the size and color of the text to suit your needs).",1481673600,2,364,4.367647058823529
