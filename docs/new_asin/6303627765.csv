7852543,2,6303627765,"First of all, this is labeled Vol. 1 which would lead you to believe it's like the first season right?  Well, it's only two episodes!!!  Way overpriced for 2 measley shows on VHS.  Also I did love this show when I was a kid but I have to admit...seeing it now, it's pretty corny and cheap.  We must not have had many options back then!!",1223251200,,336,4.123076923076923
7852544,5,6303627765,I will always remember this show!  I used to love watching it at my daycare!  I really would love to find it on dvd just for memories.,1198108800,,134,3.925925925925926
7852545,3,6303627765,My sisters and I watched this show as kids so it was a great pleasure to watch this show again as adults with kids of our own and share it with them!,1168819200,,149,3.6875
7852546,5,6303627765,"I'm 28 and I remember watching this show when Nickelodeon first came on the air. That was when A&E programs were shown at night when Nick's programming was do9ne for the day in the days before Nick at Nite.  I am suprised though on the prices for these rare VHS tapes. They are really expensive on Ebay in the price range of 60 bucks or less....I always loved this show. I used to feel sorry for Jeff, whoalways wanted to be a real person, but gave up his wish to become one to help his friends in an episode called ""Wishes"". Jeff Hyslop is such a talented performer. I found a fan site that had pics of him as the phantom in Canada's production of The Phantom Of The Opera for the long run. I remember all the characters, Jeff the manequin who came to life when someone said the magic words ""Hocus Pocus Alimagocus"", Jodie who worked in the childrens's dept., Sam the night watchman who always sang ""Yo He Ho"", penelope, Sam's cat, Muffy the mouse who always talked in rhyme and her country cousin Mort, the Mime Lady, Sam's computer TXL Series 4, Waldo the Magnificent who put the spell on Jeff's magic hat, and Mrs Pennypacker who always called Jeff, Jeffery. Oh yeah I just remembered, Wanda Willoby and Sharon, Lois, and Bram were guestes on the show as well. Ahhhhh memories...",1152921600,,1283,4.436440677966102
7852547,5,6303627765,"The 1980's was the ""golden era"" of children's television. ""Sesame Street"" had more or less hit it's peak, ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" had resumed production, and while PBS and the Saturday Morning cartoons had pretty much the monopoly on children's programming, one network would pop up in the 1970's that would totally focus on children, with the best in mind for them. NICKELODEON. Nickelodeon's early programming consisted of some original programming (by way of Pinwheel), but their reputation was built on the imported content, namely what came in from Canada. No finer an example is ""Today's Special"", produced by TV Ontario. In 1985, Nickelodeon brought American kids this show (which soon died in Canada, but was going strong here!), about a mannequin named Jeff, a store display designer named Jodie, a rhyming mouse named Muffy, and a gruff night watchman named Sam. All of these characters would get together after hours and play around (does Jodie ever go home??), sing songs and try to teach Jeff (and the audience) a lesson. The whole premise of the show was strange, and in retrospect those who watched it then might think of it as demented now, but that's what so great about shows like ""Today's Special"" and ""Pinwheel"". They were so much different from what was available at the time. Nickelodeon deprived us from this show starting in 1990, when they decided on commercial viability rather than persuing their mission to children, but thankfully, its been preserved on video. If you watch stuff like this, you'll realize just how horrible and unoriginal (not to mention clich?) the material pandered to our children these days has become.
 This tape includes two episodes of ""Today's Special"" - ""Smiles"" from 1983, and ""Fun"" from 1985. In ""Smiles"", Sam's friend, ""Sourpuss Sal"" comes to visit, and the gang tries to get her to smile, and in the end... I won't spoil it. Watch out for Sharon, Lois and Bram!
 In ""Fun"", the whole gang (plus Mrs. Pennypacker) try to get the last laugh on each other. (No spoilers here... sorry!)
 Try to find these ""Today's Special"" tapes elsewhere, I got them from a Candadian retailer known as videoflicks. Look them up. I purchased them for a mere $7.95 or so. Beware these ""Amazon sellers"" who never seem to sell anything at $79.95... If you look for something, it's out there, and reasonably may I add.",1146441600,8,2358,4.919597989949748
7852548,5,6303627765,"This was my favorite childhood show growing up. I loved the music in every episode and I also loved all of the magic (Jeff turning to life, etc.). I have been in the process of getting people to sign a petition to get ""Today's Special"" onto DVD. TVOntario has heard us (as has Nina Keogh -- the voice/puppeteer of Muffy) and they are all interested. We have already ""created quite the buzz at TVOntario.""

Go to [...] to make this a reality!",1108598400,9,441,4.378048780487805
7852549,5,6303627765,"This show was great, a fine example of Canadian children's television. I remember watching all the adventures of Muffy, Sam, Jodie and Jeff. The best were the episodes where Jeff went up to the roof to wax poetic about his quasi-humanity.",1100131200,,238,4.829268292682927
7852550,5,6303627765,"I absolutely loved this show as a child, but when I ask others about the show no one remembers.

I am so glad to know that there are other fans of this show out there, and that episodes can still be purchased.",1098403200,,209,3.9761904761904763
7852551,5,6303627765,"This is the best show ever, I am so happy to have a chance to walk down memory lane with Jeff, Muffy, Sam, and Jody. I only wish that show's like this still exsisted today. I really enjoyed the prompt delivery and mint condition that the movies arrived in. This is where I will do all my ordering from now on.",1053302400,2,309,4.081967213114754
