8279185,5,B001AR4K9O,"This DVD is an updated version of the Italian 1940's version which was in black and white with English subtitles. Whereas the Italian version presented a dramatization of various events in the composer's life, this version in color with English sub titles is more complete but is in the form of a narration with various quotes from the composer's diary. The ideal version of the composer's life on DVD would be to combine both versions, Italian and Old Rococo into one. Until then I recommend that one purchase both versions which are available on this site. One may quibble about loose ends in Old Rococo such as the Six String Sonatas, one of which opens the movie, that no mention is made of them any where else in the film, but all in all it is a great film once one gets used to the narration. The name of this DVD, Old Rococo, comes from Rossini's own characterization of himself in one of his retirement letters.",1436313600,2,919,4.542168674698795
8279186,5,B001AR4K9O,"I have played Rossini's music over the years and was thrilled to see this dvd of his life music and times. Although I have read much about him, seeing events and actually being able to see his home and surroundings made my appreciation for this wonderful talent enriched by the visuals. Beautifully filmed and narrated the story gave me a feel for the man behind the music, and the people who influenced him in his life. I give this dvd high marks for realism and historical accuracy.",1393113600,5,484,4.574712643678161
8279187,4,B001AR4K9O,"This DVD contains a nice but very brief biography of Giocchino Rossini (84 minutes).  It has brief excerpts from his many operas.  It follows his life from childhood to death.  However the brevity of the production does not allow any indepth consideration of his music.  The film has many lovely images of Italy -- where he worked, the opera houses etc.  The singers in the various productions are not identified.  Though there are no extras.  The color is good, the sound adequate.  It was a satisfying DVD despite its brevity.",1300320000,9,528,4.788888888888889
