6809168,5,B00PK7HXDU,"Just saw this in a theater so here's my pre-DVD-release review:
Kevin Kline and Maggie Smith together...what's not to love? Israel Horovitz adapted the screenplay from his stage play. And it shows: this feels like three movies, each with a different tone, reflecting the shifting feel of the 3-Act stage play.
If you don't want spoilers, stop reading now-- and just take my word for it that you'll probably enjoy this quirky, moody, atmospheric little film.

SPOILER ALERT SYNOPSIS:

The always wonderful Kevin Kline is a failed writer who flies from NYC to Paris when his estranged father dies and leaves him a gorgeously located 4,000 SF Parisian apartment worth millions of Euros. His anticipated sale of this flat will replace Kline's middleaged poverty with instant windfall wealth that will make him a wealthy man for the rest of his life-- as well as redeem the memory of an estranged father who never seemed to love him while alive.

But to Kline's surprise and shock, the flat's real estate title turns out to be a  'Viager', a once-common French occupancy-for-life arrangement in which 92-year-old Englishwoman Maggie Smith is entitled to continue living undisturbed in the flat for the rest of her life; only when she dies will Kline actually inherit and move in. In the meantime, the penniless Kline has 'inherited' only his late father's ongoing obligation to continue paying the grasping and mercenary Maggie Smith 2,400 Euros every month for as long as she lives. Worse, also living in the apartment is Smith's insufferable middle aged daughter Chloe, a shrewish harridan who secretly rifles through Kline's wallet and luggage, refuses to recognize his property rights and generally makes herself unpleasant, impossible and in-your-face intolerable.

The plot twists and revelations here aren't especially surprising, but they are well acted. Kline discovers that Smith was, in her youth, his estranged father's Other Woman, although married herself at the time to Chloe's father (now deceased).
The unfortunate 'viager' lifetime apartment deal was actually his father's mechanism for providing for Smith's lifelong financial security-- which we suspect the younger Smith may have extorted via blackmail.
Meanwhile, middleaged daughter Chloe has been having an affair with a very married man, and Kline attempts some blackmail of his own.

Overwhelmed by the stress and revelations, recovering alcoholic Kline falls off the wagon with a splash, drinks until he passes out beside the Seine and is robbed of his phone and last remaining cash, and spends most of his remaining scenes padding around the flat swigging from a succession of Smith's vintage wine bottles.
There ensues a series of Virginia Woolf scenes of emotional grief, mutual accusations and delusional denial between Kline and Smith as she rationalizes her behavior and Kline reveals an unloved life of abandonment, neglect and suicide attempts.

Just as playwright/screenwright Horovitz seems to have written himself into a dead end, daughter Chloe, her eyes opened by the damage her mother's affair wreaked in young Kline's life, goes to her Married Man and ends it, admonishing him to be a good husband and father to 'your beautiful family'. With that, Horovitz alters her character 180', and suddenly she becomes likeable, endlessly compassionate and suddenly romantically attracted to Kline. On one hand it's a welcome break from the nonstop enmity so far, and it's endearingly acted. On the other hand it's quite a stretch for viewers to accept this miraculous turnaround of Chloe's character.

Cynics will note that a relationship with Kline is Chloe's perfect solution; instead of being ejected from her rent-free nest at 50+ whenever Cher Mama Maggie dies, daughter Chloe will just seamlessly redecorate the flat with the smitten and desperately vulnerable Kline.
The film ends on a happy note; Kline refuses a 9-million-Euro offer on the flat from a local condo developer (which he can always decide to accept later on) and Chloe and Kline embrace in the garden while Mother Maggie looks approvingly on.

There are some logical/chronological contradictions here on Smith's character which become increasingly apparent as the plot unfolds; once you get to Plot Reveal 2 or 3, all the previous actions of her character suddenly cease to make sense, once the viewer knows what Maggie's character has known all along. That's OK as a dramatic trick on the first viewing, but it undermines the pleasure in seeing the film a second or third time.

The vast rambling apartment filled with a lifetime of dusty French antiques and curios is the main set, and the flat becomes a sort of character in its own right, and many of the set's details add enormously to the mood and enjoyment of the film.
The trick with an improbable-scenario piece like 'My Old Lady' is not to let the domestic premise descend into outright Farce. A premise like 'The Odd Couple' is barely plausible as a temporary arrangement, but Felix is just crashing on his buddy's sofa-- not playing earnest dramatic mutual-revelation psychodrama steeped in decades of family deceit.

'My Old Lady' walks that fine line, but the excellent cast manages to keep the premise from dissolving into either melodrama or pratfalls. It's a mostly humorless and serious script; Kline brings his trademark light touch to some lines of rueful irony, and Smith has some choice lines, always perfectly delivered, and there are scattered moments of the darkly absurd, but 2 of the 3 acts are played with deadly earnest, as if the last 20 minutes were shot by an entirely different director. That kind of shifting mood is easier to pull off on a stage than in a film.

This is a wry, entertaining little film with prolonged scenes of real unpleasantness in which none of the characters is very likable, placed in a perfectly imagined Parisian 19C apartment and played by a fine cast--who manage to be enjoyable to watch even when their characters are not.
If you're in the mood for that, you'll love 'My Old Lady'. I did. By all means, enjoy.

Hope this review is helpful. Happy viewing.",1418342400,183,6116,5.085742771684945

An American man (Kevin Kline) who has failed at relationships and work inherits an apartment in Paris but arrives, broke, to find it is inhabited by an old woman (Maggie Smith) and her daughter (Kristen Scott Thomas) and that French law allows them to stay. Great elements for a cool movie. But- None of the characters are likable. Their situation and the rooms are pictured as dark. and the soliloquies of despair from the man are annoying. For unknown reasons they keep barging in to the bathroom when it is occupied. No locks? Romantic?

I agree with one of the other reviewers.......you should probably be over 50 to watch and take from this film the difficult, funny, tragic life events. The acting was spot on-Maggie Smith is such a remarkable talent. This film was no exception. Kevin Kline was perfectly cast as Matteus/Jim. Tortured and dark as he could never escape his childhood, and all the heartache it brought with it. I was not familiar with the actress that played Chloe, but she was excellent as well. I truly enjoyed this movie-the good, bad and the ugly.",1498953600,,566,4.7272727272727275

6809200,5,B00PK7HXDU,"BRILLIANTLY CAST, this is a tough movie to watch, you need to be willing to get your head around European property laws and traditional social issues.  We Americans can be very rigidly colonial in our beliefs even now. And it reflects the issues that grown children need to confront from both dysfunctional families and their own success and failures. However, that said, it never occured to me to leave off watching and I do leave many movies that I don't like. Nor is his my normal genra, but I am glad I saw it.

6809208,4,B00PK7HXDU,"A lot of people seem to want life tied up in a nice package with a beautiful bow on top. All problems cleared up, all possible disasters averted and everyone lives happily. Sorry, kids. Life is messy and improbable. This film is messy, wonderfully so. People meet other people even if they are married sometimes. And love leads them into places they should not have gone. And it gets difficult. And their loved ones get hurt.

To be able to illuminate this kind of mess in such a colorful, quirky way, with such wonderful dialogue, good acting and a beautiful backdrop takes some doing. To do it and keep viewers engaged takes even more. All three main actors do a great job at portraying the messy, mixed up lives they lead and the story does resolve itself happily, but there's some pain before you get there.

This film explores a dark secret that destroyed two families because of the selfishness of two people and the pain that it left behind. A good film. Excellent actors. But I did feel that they were afraid to go after Maggie Smith's character for all the harm she caused and the fact that she felt no guilt for anything simple because the part was played by a beloved actress. I wanted stronger reactions from Scott and Kline when Smith talked so selfishly about the past. She feels no guilt at all.  But the actors weren't given the words to express real anger. I have to give it three stars for that. It could have been a stronger film.,1494547200,2,750,4.357142857142857

6809233,3,B00PK7HXDU,"If one is looking for a romantic comedy, this would not be it. While it has some amusing moments, it is most definitely not comedic, overall. It is the story of Mathias, a sad, miserable, unhappy fifty-seven year old man (Kevin Kline), whose wealthy but estranged  father has died but has left him nothing in his will other than an apartment in a good neighborhood in Paris, France. So, off he goes to Paris to start life anew, having divested himself of his old one. Arriving virtually penniless, he discovers that all is not as he expected.

It seems that the apartment is occupied by a ninety something woman (Maggie Smith) and her middle-aged daughter (Kristen Scott Thomas). The elderly woman apparently has a legal right to occupy the apartment til she dies, and the inheritor is also obligated to pay her twenty three hundred euros a month while she is occupancy. Needless to say,  Mathias is decidedly unhappy with the arrangement and schemes to try and secure the apartment for himself. Along the way, he learns some unvarnished truths about his father and himself.

While Maggie Smith is as droll and charming as ever, and Kristen Scott Thomas's performance is excellent, I can't say the same about Kevin Kline. His character is totally repellent,  and he utterly fails in making himself  the least bit likeable. Even when he has a somewhat redemptive moment at the end, it rings false. Consequently, the movie remains mired in mediocrity.

Now, Kevin Kline is normally a fine actor, so it could be the script. Still, if one does not care about his character, one will not care about this film, which really only gets a save due to Maggie Smith's performance. On the upside, the cinematography is quite nice and captures the flavor of Paris. Still, it is an otherwise mediocre film from which one will derive only a modicum of enjoyment. So, watch this film only if you have nothing better to do.",1487721600,2,1906,4.740181268882175

Even though you have several quite rich actors/actresses that are playing low key not so wealthy characters(always my weaknesses in enjoying some movies), these characters do a good job in pulling it off, in particular, Kline & Thomas.  Maybe Kline's character (spoiler) should have been a bit more happy, knowing he would be quite well off after selling an inherited apartment in France from his father, even if he would decide not to take the huge payoff, but hey, I might have done the same thing for such a beautiful woman, especially if I was him....lol.

I was surprised by the level of truth I felt from the script, and the actors were good...but absolutely the WORST movie kissers I've ever seen!...but not the point of the film.  Anyway, it is a great low budget film; easy to follow, and rife with the reality of ""adult children in pain"". The soundtrack is mellow ""Parisian faire"", and the cinematography shows some of the less famous Parisian scenery. Myself, I think all cities seem to look and feel the same...lots of concrete, and lots of people. They did manage to keep the amount of people to a minimum, though.

6809397,5,B00PK7HXDU,"This film explores the truth about the pain and loss associated with being the victim of cheating parents. It is so politically incorrect I am dazzled. In this day and age of ""s'est la vie"" (sp), it is so refreshing to watch people explore the whole painful truth of their parents and of their own life and choices. This is expertly portrayed by very good actors who don't disappoint. And I never fail to be refreshed by seeing the real healing and change in previously stuck and entrenched ways when the truth does come out, is faced, and people grapple with it and their feelings about it.
It truly validated me as a wounded, self-hating (because I perceived my parents hated me), adult child and gave me hope as well.",1482537600,,720,4.546153846153846

Truly, someone's love dream, is someone's wracking ball....
I don't think the movie title does it justice and I wonder how many viewers it lost due to it, but if you want something meaningful and heartfelt and

An extremely talented cast carry the story along its many twists, catching your breath occasionally, getting you caught up in the strange French system of home ownership.

They could have done a better job at explaining what a ""viager"" is - I'll save you the search, it's the French version of a Reverse Mortgage.  Except that in France it is apparently a lot more common than it is in the US for these arrangements to be privately funded.

If I wanted to be a film critic, I could say 'hey, it's been done, it's light and fluffly, blah, blah..."" yep, it's a comedy and it's Kevin Kline, Maggie Smith and whatshername (forever The English Patient  to me) (just like Meryl is forever Sophie or the French Lt.'swoman)  Anyway,  I loved it!!  Hated the title cuz I'm an old lady, but Maggie is to die for.",1477612800,,578,4.563106796116505
6809494,4,B00PK7HXDU,Excellent casting.  Good story but leaves unanswered questions as it ended. That drives my husband nuts; me not so much.  Well worth watching to enjoy Klein and Smith battle wits.  By the time it ended I was ready to pack for a trip to France.,1477612800,,243,4.355555555555555

6809496,1,B00PK7HXDU,Did not care for this movie.  The actors were all wonderful but the story was so gloomy.  I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't.  I'm disappointed in general with the movies on Amazon Prime.  I bought a Fire Stick thinking it would have good programming.

6809501,3,B00PK7HXDU,"My husband and I watched ""My Old Lady"" based on it's star power alone. You can't beat Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas and Kevin Kline. Actually, we were rather disappointed with the movie. It started slowly, dragged a bit, and we struggled to maintain interest. We stuck with it anyway. It had a feel good kind of ending. Yet,we really wished we had watched something else. If you really like Maggie Smith by all means watch it.

The story line has some twists and other case members including Frenchman Dominique Pinon, who is in the second role I've seen him in, plays an interesting and fun realtor.

6809559,5,B00PK7HXDU,Warm. Funny. Enjoyable.  Charming movie. Perfect for that night of cuddling under a quilt on the couch. Kevin Kline is excellent as the down and out middle age man that thinks his inheritance of an apartment in France due to his father's death as his new lease on life. Maggie Smith of Downton Abbey fame is everything you would expect from the fine actress. Her relationship to Kline takes some time but is joyful to watch.,1476230400,,424,4.578947368421052

It's all there if you pay attention.  As with all life and interactions, it was complex and sometimes very painful.  Yet in the end it resolved beautifully.

6809623,3,B00PK7HXDU,"A strange movie dominated by an apartment.  The place in which most of the movie takes place is like another character -- the central motif and motivation of all the action that takes place within it and because of it.  The acting is excellent but the story itself lacks verisimilitude.  We are asked to believe that a 57 year old man, seemingly normal though not especially happy with his life and circumstances, will become unglued when he learns his Dad had an affair.  His reaction, even when it appears he also lost his mother decades earlier because of the infidelity, feels extreme.  Meanwhile, as the result of a casual comment, the Kristin Scott Thomas character ends an affair she has been having with a married man.  This decision also seems unrealistic and arbitrary.  Finally, two relative strangers become romantically involved way too quickly, given the back story and the repressed and furtive natures they express. Given the excellence of the production and the quality of the acting it would not be possible to dislike the overall experience. But the ability to believe in the characters and the changes that take place in their relationships seems forced upon them rather than an unfoldment to which the viewer can comfortably relate.",1475280000,,1253,4.966507177033493

The film leaves so much unresolved and misleads us to anticipate the relief of distress created by the subplots running through the fabric of the story. I would imagine that on stage, the presence of the living actors within the reach of the audience (as opposed to the remoteness of the screen) would lend itself to more of an assimilation of this very bittersweet situation for the auditor as opposed to the film's viewer.",1474848000,,501,4.5777777777777775

6809747,3,B00PK7HXDU,A light drama. Maggie Smith's character appeared clueless at first but actually witty. Plot can be slow and a lot of hand-wavering that possibly good for stage by Kline. There are some feel good revelation towards the end. Not too bad.,1473292800,,235,4.7560975609756095

6809790,5,B00PK7HXDU,Great acting. This is not a sugary sweet movie; it has some very realistic dilemmas  and pains. Kline is an unlikable character for the most of it as he battles his demons but they all come together at the end.

Frankly, not only did it make me dislike the character, but I wanted to SHAKE him and say 'get over it and take responsibility for yourself! No one owes you anything!'

6809855,5,B00PK7HXDU,This movie opens our eyes to the dramas around us - the ones that destroy us and rebuild us.  It's about learning to live with one's decisions but not always fully understanding the full impact of them on others - then how we find forgiveness and love to fill that empty space of loneliness. There is redemption and it's set in Paris.,1471651200,,334,4.387096774193548

6809857,4,B00PK7HXDU,"I really enjoyed this movie. In part because it takes place in Paris where I recently spent time and it captures the mood of that city and uses this as  a backdrop for characters who are basically British and American and can't quite accept the ""C'est la vie!""  approach to life.  Maggie Smith is, of course, her wonderful, curmudgeonly self, old and seemingly frail but never-the-less indestructible.  Kristin Scott Thomas who plays her daughter and Kevin Kline who turns up on their doorstep, by what appears to be financial serendipity are two lonely, bitter, unhappy people who blame their parents for the emptiness in their lives. I gave the movie 4 stars because it was just a little predictable and facile.",1471651200,,713,4.867768595041323

6809866,3,B00PK7HXDU,"The setting and backdrop to this film is Paris, France. The film plays exactly like an off Broadway 3 person production: estranged American middle-aged self-loathing son, old French woman, middle-aged daughter of old french woman. Very pretentious film, which would not in itself be so bad if not for the film is entirely based on long bits of exchanged self-indulged dialog. Slow moving, dimly lit for the most part, solemn lowly playing background music all play into the what is meant to be arty, artsy quality of the film =hogwash. Dusty and old and boring is how i describe it, just as the Paris residence the main character(American son) inherits. Nothing at all draws you to care about or for any of these selfish characters, if i hung around folk's like this i would hate my life as they hate theirs. I would recommend saving you're time and efforts toward any viewing of this film and put those toward more gainful pursuits.",1471564800,,933,4.765432098765432

6810047,1,B00PK7HXDU,"Ew.

This film has a despicable Woody Allen ""aura"" and leaves one feeling molested.

Woody Allen film (noun): Disgusting male main character is neurotic and inappropriate (usually sexually), behaves in horrid manner that only a misogynist ""men's rights"" activist could love, and is rewarded in the end with the love of a woman who would/should never give him the time of day and may gain other (i.e. material/property) benefits as a result. Consistent moral: Slimy men finish first.

Don't bother watching this trash -  You won't finish it if decency is a thing for you.  Despicable main character (Kline) acts the perverted stalker and steals and pawns furniture from under the nose of his father's eldery mistress, stalks the mistress's adult daughter to extort a property that he can't contractually possess yet (and is too much of a failure as a person to accept that his father entered into a lawful contract that he must simply wait out.  This, apparently, is because he would rather lick his wounds as a failed writer than get an actual job.  Oddly, both the Mother [Smith] and the Daughter in the film work, and the mother is 92 years old. Kline's character, on the other hand, steals, extorts, stalks, and complains.)

Horrible.  How could they do this to the extraordinary Maggie Smith? My, but she can act, but even her talent doesn't block the festering stench emanating from this film.  Ugh...",1469232000,,1406,4.894514767932489

6810103,5,B00PK7HXDU,"This movie I didn't know nothing about, but when I saw it had the lady from Harry Porter in it, I knew it had to be a good movie. Kevin Kline was great in his role and to be honest I didn't know who he was until I heard his voice. I remember he was in the show ""Last Vegas"" with Morgan Freeman. I knew this was going to be even better.

It is about the character that Kevin Kline plays and he learns a lot about his childhood and his dad. I don't won't to say anything else, because I am afraid I might give more information then what is needed.

It is a great movie and I don't think you will be disappointed.",1468713600,,610,3.872

6810111,3,B00PK7HXDU,Acting was good. I liked the way the characters finally processed their own relationships with the deceased person and how their lives had evolved based on incomplete information and assumptions to allow long overdue healing to take place.,1468713600,,239,5.315789473684211
6810112,5,B00PK7HXDU,"I really liked this movie. It's not fast moving, or stellar, or anything like that. A middle aged man who has failed at pretty much everything he has ever attempted inherits an apartment building in France from his father. Thinking he can sell it and get his life back on track, he makes a trip to see it in person. An elderly woman lives there and he tells her he is the new owner and is selling the place. He feels a bit cheated as his father is buried ""somewhere in Europe"" and his money went to an ""undisclosed charity,"" but at least he got a house - right? Imagine his frustration when he learns that his father bought the house from the woman; she is to be allowed to live there for the rest of her life and continue to be paid the monthly payment his father made to her while he was alive. Wait, what? He inherited a house that is really a debt even if he sells it?

She is cantankerous. intelligent, but not without feeling, as only Maggie Smith can play. Her daughter, however - who happens to be currently living in the apartment, as well - is protective of her mother so doesn't think highly of the new landlord so naturally, they clash at every turn.

As the man seeks a buyer willing to purchase the house with the viager, he discovers a number of things: the adulterous relationship his father had with the woman for many years, the affair the woman's daughter is having with a married man, why the house is important to both of them. and countless old photos that the woman reluctantly, carefully, and selectively explains.

As each side learns about the other, there is regret but understanding, and in the end compassion. Relationships are very different when viewed from within than from without. This story is a perfect example of why you shouldn't judge another until you've walked in their shoes. All sides have suffered pain but in the end, there can be solace in shared pain. But how you get there is a unique journey. While the movie lagged a bit for me in the middle, I'm glad I stuck with it because I love how the three major characters traveled emotionally before reaching common ground. it is not a movie I will soon forget.",1468627200,11,2153,4.431818181818182

It wasn't until 20 minutes in that I realized what a hidden little gem this movie is. It is a genre piece that shows situations that we are not aware of yet are universal in their appeal  It is love scorned love lost and then love won thru the prism of mid life in the heart of Paris.

Of course, having the romantic setting of Paris, with its phenomenal architecture as a backdrop, added to the movies enchantment.

6810212,3,B00PK7HXDU,This has a bit of a slow start; but becomes more engaging as one goes along. Still seems like one of those navel gazing inward looking movies in the Woody Allen genre; which for me can become tedious for an entertainment venue.,1467417600,,227,4.428571428571429

6810219,4,B00PK7HXDU,"A terrible title for a good, maybe great movie.  Superior dialogue over unexpected themes.  Definitely not a show for teens and below because of themes: adjustments of adult children to life with negligent parents, suicide, and some other ethically ambiguous actions  I think you have to be above thirty to feel it but maybe those over 20 would get it.",1467244800,,352,4.833333333333333

The characters must through good acting and dialog must lead you into how they got to where they are without an omniscient narrator or revealing monologue.

The story is made more complicated because the alcoholic realizes the old woman had been a former lover of his father, and the alcoholic is there at this old woman's apartment to claim it because his father bought the apartment many years ago in France. The ending has romance in it, and demonstrates the moving power of compassion when people finally listen to each other despite their differences.",1466121600,,689,4.8474576271186445

6810416,5,B00PK7HXDU,"A surprisingly entertaining and heartwarming gem of a movie! Based on a play and both, directed and written for the screen by the playwrite, this could have gone either way. Howerver this movie turned out to be one of the rare play to movie adaptations that turned out just right: filmed on location in Paris and with a stellar cast, that shined to the last moment. Maggie Smith here not the snide, sharp tongued matriarch we know (and love) from Downton Abbey, but a questionable yet warm hearted old woman who has yet to come to grips with her multi-faceted past. A warm performance that is equaly matched by Kevin Kline's desperate but loveable loser who comes to Paris to collect his inheritance only to find out, he also inherited his father's long standing commitment to ""his old lady"". Rounding out this acting triumvirate, is Kristin Scott Thomas, as the old lady's spinster daughter with a secret of her own... If you like superb acting, well developed story lines and complicated happy endings, this is well worth the watch. This movie is a great example that we don't need elaborate settings and bank breaking special effects to be thoroughly entertained.",1465430400,,1166,4.835

6810587,5,B00PK7HXDU,"What a find! I found this film just scrolling through the movies on offer and was attracted by the presence of Maggie Smith. It's not a perfect film, but its sometimes klunky dialogue and occasional silly scenes are irrelevant when one pays attention to the acting. All three leads are wonderful. Thomas is even better in a role like this than the roles she played when younger. Kline is his usual character, but in this case it works almost perfectly. And Smith? This is a tour de force. She is a brilliant actress at any time, but she really outdoes herself in this film. People who only know her from Downton Abbey should see this movie to see the breadth and depth of her talent. I intend to watch this movie several times to uncover the subtleties which are hard to discern the first time around. The lukewarm reviews by professional movie critics have done this film a disservice. It is a movie for any middle aged and elderly (like me) moviegoer and for any movie fan who appreciates brilliant acting.",1463961600,,1008,4.574585635359116

Adult choices have damaged children and created deep wounds.  Watching Maggie and Kevin discover each other is a treat.  The sideline, wherein Kristin Scott Thomas and Kline reach for each other sexually, does not ring true.  Thomas' character, so furious with Kline's at the beginning of the movie, would surely not accept him so readily as a lover . And Kline is intimate with her before clearing the fact that he is not actually her sister...no!

It started out to be a quirky and intriguing comedy/drama ended up being a not amusing, draining dip into OTC psychological rant and a baby boomer whinge about ones parents and the lost opportunities because the protagonist embraced being victims rather forgiving their parents, themselves, and move on with their respective lives.  Too much navel gazing and not enough of the humor and humanity that initially would have made it a much better outing....over all - unless you are a major fan of Kevin Kline and Maggie Smith give it a pass",1462492800,,615,5.079207920792079

Excellent story on how one might survive a difficult upbringing, finally putting blame where it belongs.

6810740,4,B00PK7HXDU,"A solidly good movie, and I'm really in between a 3 and 4 for it.  However, it does run slowly, and it is creepy how the couple are intimate before verifying that they are not brother and sister.  Also, the movie would have been catapulted into greatness if they had showed Mathias' childhood experiences with this mother, the woman's childhood experiences with her parents, and the earlier romance between the philanderer and his mistress.  That would have garnered more sympathy for all of the characters, and it would have made the viewer much more interested in the film, as seeing prior experiences rather than simply being told about them generally has those effects in movies.  Overall, great acting by the three characters, but all the best acting in the world cannot overcome the flaw of a lack of historical information on them central figures in the film.",1461974400,,866,4.870748299319728

It would be very easy to dislike his character, but somehow he makes him sympathetic, even when he's being a jerk.  And Kristin Scott-Thomas is always good - she is just so beautiful, and it's nice to look at her. The script has an unusual story, not the usual regurgitated story you've seen over and over again.  While it's worth watching until the end, the middle is difficult to get through because Kevin Kline's character has some really big problems and it's very uncomfortable (for me, anyway, plus I didn't know how things would turn out).  The location is beautiful -- not the Paris we're used to seeing again and again, but a very specific and lovely, small slice of a real neighborhood in Paris.  Highly recommend this movie.

The real estate storyline was kind of dull, confusing, and generally should have been a side story rather than the main theme.

Having said that, I take every opportunity to watch Maggie Smith while I can. She is simply extraordinary and I like most everything she does. She does not disappoint. Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas were solid and made me feel their pain and exhilaration.",1459209600,,692,4.492063492063492

6811103,4,B00PK7HXDU,"Quirky, sometimes heart-rending story line, with a few moments of gentle comedy - good character studies by very talented actors.  Has an indie film feel but with a bit more polish.  Dame Maggie had a tough role, the character she plays is actually not a very likable person, and yet you find yourself liking her probably more than you should.  Kevin Kline (I find my fingers fumbling over the typing of these words!) did a fantastic job with his role - if you're like me and think of Mr. Kline as having no soul and being a dreadful actor be prepared to be very surprised here. Kristen Scott Thomas is flawless - not sure if I've ever seen her in any other roles but she was a delight to watch in this one, your heart breaks for her as well watching her character struggle through this very difficult time in her life.  All and all a very nice, if slow-paced film with very real people inhabiting this story.",1456876800,,909,4.392857142857143
6811104,5,B00PK7HXDU,Great movie for grown ups. Kevin Kline certainly fit the role of a three times divorced man with nothing to show for at the end of his career and who met a stubborn old lady who lived with her daughter in the house that he inherited from his recently deceased father. The story magnificently slowly unravel the intricate and surprising relationships between each character. The ending was pleasantly surprising.,1456876800,,411,4.971014492753623

The previews were very skewed on this movie, portraying it to be far different than the actual film (they were actually cut and pasted, as we re-watched the trailer to see why we thought the movie would be worth watching in the first place).

I was disappointed at the DVD.  Then I decided to find this movie on Amazon Video instead.  I found Amazon Video have it with an available CC.  Thank God!  That's really what I needed!

Anyways, about this movie, I don't know anything about French law.  It's interesting...  An emotional between 3 people living in a big house.  This guy stuck in it but in the end, he changed his mind about the big house.  Paris is where finding love is.",1456185600,,607,4.486238532110092

6811200,2,B00PK7HXDU,very slow moving and story line just didn't work for me.  It does show how affairs can mess up people and families and for that it was good.  But those who are in such situations would always think their case was different.,1456099200,,223,4.285714285714286

6811204,4,B00PK7HXDU,This was a real surprise. It was kind of a last resort pick and seemed a little disjointed at first. The story built slowly and with surprising humor and sadness. I just couldn't turn it off and was sad to see it end. Good actors and an unusual story.,1456012800,,251,4.142857142857143
6811205,4,B00PK7HXDU,"Hard to quibble with the cast, which is first rate, although the resolution is presented a little too conveniently. Still worth the time just to see Maggie Smith.",1456012800,,162,4.821428571428571

6811215,2,B00PK7HXDU,"Interesting premise, but it seemed that Kline's character was looking to blame everyone/anyone else for his lack luster life and using those around him in an unconscionable way.  The female characters where good, but still gave up watching when we could see that nothing was getting any better.

6811260,4,B00PK7HXDU,"Maggie Smith dioes her usual bang up job, Kevin Kline, not so much and Kristin Scoot Thomas is workmanlie. Story is a little difficult to credit. One has to believe that the three main characters on the screen and some who though now dead are referenced in the screen play are all sadly deficient when it comes to introspection and understanding that their actions affect others. Even tho Maggie acts well, her justifications for her hsitorical self would suggest that her character is narcissistic at best and a blithering idiot at worst. Why a 4 star - because it is watchable and I love Maggie Smith.",1455580800,,603,4.69811320754717

The plot is quite meaningful, dealing with the problem of  the married partner and the kids when an affair happens.  Never saw a film before which touched this subject from the point of view of the families involved. It's a tad long which is why I made it a 4 star  not 5.",1454976000,,412,4.575342465753424

6811376,2,B00PK7HXDU,"This is one of those movies that should have been great, but isn't. It's a weird mishmash of rom/com/drama, with awkward rom, bitter com, and dark, yet completely false footed drama. I started to give it three stars because Maggie Smith is a gem in this and Kristin Scott Thomas does a very capable job (Kevin Kline was on typical auto-overacting), but as I started to write the review I realized I couldn't give it that high a mark. The script seemed trite and unbelievable and the ending - which you could see within fifteen minutes of the opening credits - was just schlock. Every character needs a good shrink and some zoloft - or perhaps they should just move out of that damned dreary apartment that is the center of the drama. They call Paris 'the city of light,' but judging by the apartment the sobriquet didn't come out of the mouths of anyone who'd ever visited that dim, dingy-looking, unlit unit. The 'happy ending' was made more morose by the idea that now everyone would be trapped in the apartment. Viewed in that manner I'd have to say this might actually have been a fairly effective horror movie.",1454716800,,1115,4.58

6811381,4,B00PK7HXDU,"This is a very touching story, as unexpected truths emerge layer by layer, forcing both the characters and the viewer to rethink what they thought they knew.  Seldom does one see portrayed so clearly the ever-widening circles of hurt that are created by deception that may seem at first innocent or at least of limited harm.  Perhaps some portions may push the bounds of plausibility, but I found the drama captivating and even inspiring, in spite of the darker elements.",1454630400,,471,4.875

6811443,4,B00PK7HXDU,Maggie Smith at her inimitable best! Kevin Kline plays off her nicely. The weakness of the film (and its predecessor play) is the romance between Kevin Kline and Chloe (Kristin Scott Thomas). Poor Kristin does a superb job with not much--she's been written into a corner which is all too predictable by Israel Horowitz. Excellent photography.,1454371200,,342,5.125

6811511,5,B00PK7HXDU,"I loved this movie.  I am rating it in its own category of small, ""meaningful"" movies, rather than comparing it to epic films.

The acting was beyond outstanding.  Had no idea Kevin Kline could be that incredible.  He was pure genius.  Of course Smith and Scott-Thomas were also beyond amazing.

Loved the way the plot unfolds -- mostly through Maggie's character, as she baffles the two younger people with her revelations.

And, most of all, it's impressive to see such a theme so well presented:  two adults facing and better understanding the cause of their life challenges as based in their childhood difficulties.  This is amazingly well portrayed.

It's mesmerizing to watch Maggie Smith, especially in this role.

For me, it's a movie I will remember.",1453939200,,759,4.944444444444445

6811746,4,B00PK7HXDU,Maggie Smith amazing as always.  I loved the story and the fact that even though it took a while to get to the happy ending when it got there it was all very good.

6811772,3,B00PK7HXDU,"The movie begins with a promising premise but then falls apart at the halfway point. A man (Kevin Kline) inherits an apartment building in Paris and discovers that rather than being an income producer it requires that the owner pay a monthly fee to the sole 92-year-old tenant (Maggie Smith), who, it turns out, had an affair with the owner's father. A love interest develops between the Kline character and the tenant's daughter, but there is tension because of the financial arrangement. So far so good, but the resolution is murky and involved and would have benefited greatly from judicious editing. Suggestion to potential viewers: Watch the first hour and then turn it off and write your own ending. It will be better than the film's.",1448323200,,740,4.880952380952381

With a cast of specialists - Kevin Kline, Maggie Smith and Kristin Scott Thomas, it's wonderfully acted. It's the writing that falls a bit short. It's somewhat plodding, enervating . It's almost really good; not almost good, because it has the makings of an excellent story and has some very clever turns of phrase. It just needs more captivating storytelling and more cogent action. Worth a viewing.",1447286400,,491,4.927710843373494

Kristin Scott Thomas started out with her typically wonderful acting skill, then seems to have taken a ting cues from Kline and starts overacting her character too. Maggie Smith is fabulous - she's the only reason this film is watchable - the 3 stars are all for her 5+ star work.

6812076,4,B00PK7HXDU,"I like it but...the four stars are for Maggie and Kristen, the latter for once not playing a 'one-note' cold-hearted frosty flake.  One star removed for casting song and dance man Kevin Kline in a role requiring subtlety.  He may be solid for Broadway's high stepping torch fantasies, but he's one of those otherwise competent American performers who mistakes shouting for acting.  And who needs to watch a self pitying predictable drunk...scene after scene...sooooo kitchen sink proto commie sixties...but there's the dramatist's lack too.  A man is not a man unless he's half a women bawling his eyes out after a hissy fit.

Obviously a stage play adapted to a low budget movie with a few locals cast for 'color.'

Back to Maggie's 'Mathilde.'  She takes a huge risk inviting this man to live in her home, owner or not.  How many of you would want your landlord to show up penniless and move in, angry and maudlin....?

The annoyance factor his high; and the 'oooo, don't look now' flirtation with fraternal incest puts it in the 'social engineering agenda' category.  It is annoying because it depicts life in the late 20th century as one dragged out depression era.  Characters are shrouded in post war communist grey which is so far from reality.  There was fun: non digital, person to person communication; strength of character; people didn't whine and kvetch about their lousy parents until, say the Clinton era, and alcoholics went to AA instead of shrinks.

Having said that, Maggie and Kristen were wonderfully nuanced and syncretic and Paris is gorgeous - at least the four blocks that we were allowed to see.  Loved the opera singer warbling by the Seine.

Love:Hate factor = 90:10  Worth seeing.  The above is one person's opinion.  You may love Kline, loathe Kristen - chacun a son gout as they say a Paris!  But you have to love Maggie.  That's an order!",1444608000,,1870,4.802507836990595

6812084,5,B00PK7HXDU,"Great movie ! Based on a play written by Israel Horovitz and set in the middle of idyllic Paris, this movie ('My Old Lady') is about the deep and cruel hurt parents inadvertently inflict on their kids by engaging in extra-marital affairs.

Kids suffer emotionally when their parents fall out of love and end up in divorce. According to this movie, kids suffer even MORE when their parents do NOT divorce, but engage in on-going, semi-clandestine adulterous relationships with third parties. Not only do the kids involved become emotionally torn and estranged from the adulterous parent, they suffer - vicariously - the emotional pain of the non-adulterous parent, a wound that can stunt their emotional growth for life. This sobering story prods those kids (now older adults) to move past their childhood pain and move on with life.

Despite the seriousness of the story, this movie will make you laugh a lot, as its overlying story is funny and its script incisively witty. With a formidable cast including Maggie Smith and Kevin Kline ('Sophie's Choice'), the acting is absolutely first class ! Playwright Israel Horovitz, who also directed this movie (his first ever) deserves enormous acclaim.

This movie is a must-see especially for those libertarians, who think love is the exclusive domain of consenting adults. Think again - if you have kids.",1444348800,,1351,5.076576576576577

6812102,3,B00PK7HXDU,"I loved the Paris setting and being exposed to the slice of someone else's life, utterly alien from my own. All of the peripheral characters were wonderfully quirky and felt real. They were the ones I wanted the film to explore. The main characters, that we were stuck with for over a very long hour and forty-seven minutes, were one-dimensional, dysfunctional cardboard--and not very likable cardboard. And why, may one ask, is this advertised as a dark comedy? It's dark--literally, in the interior scenes--but there was precious little out of the leads to make you smile, let alone ROTFL.

I usually like these three actors, particularly Maggie Smith, but I felt no desire to invest myself in their story. They were too self-involved to allow for viewer involvement. In the end I felt sorry for them, but I also felt like a voyeur because I never got close to these greedy, blackmailing, self-righteous, alcoholic, suicidal, it's-all-about-me-and-my-pain, people.

Oddly enough, despite all the depression and personal, soul-destroying anguish bandied about, you don't really feel that any of these people are in the least bit vulnerable. They seem more like wounded sharks circling each other looking for an opening. How can your heart be touched by what they say they've suffered, when what we see is each of them gouging the other without apology or remorse?

Also what was with the 180 turn around at the end, from darkly literary angsty to twisted Walt Disney ever after? I found the tacked on romance unbelievable, commercial and, yes, tacky. After all, no one--including the smooching couple--know if they're brother and sister or not. How was this ending supposed to make us feel that surviving the foregoing film made it all worthwhile? It didn't.

But the Paris scenes were lovely.",1444176000,,1794,5.050675675675675

To start, it featured Maggie Smith, Kevin Kline and Kristen Scott Thomas. The screenplay was well written and well acted. No there was not a lot of action, but there was some family intrigue. The movie's examination of the pain of the children of adulterous parents was gut wrenching and insightful. A bit of French scenery also kept me interested.",1442707200,,462,4.646341463414634

6812250,5,B00PK7HXDU,"Three incomparable actors lead by Maggie Smith who is the crown jewels of acting! A story I'm confident (in a non cocky way) the American people may not grasp, yet the Europeans understand has a story line you put your teeth in and won't let go.
We've all had our disappointments when growing up, yet it does not compare to being a prop to your parents love, or lack thereof story culminating in another child.
I would be surprised if none of you watching this movie thought it was slow..... you ain't seen nothing yet....this was lightning fast to the French movies in the old days...so not too slow for me.
If you want to get a glimpse of holding your childhood to a mirror, this is a good movie to compare your childhood to what it could have been......or not!
Great acting by Maggie Smith as always, by Kevin Kline and by Kristin Scott Thomas!!

6812303,3,B00PK7HXDU,"Based on the cast list and the synopsis, I expected to be a lot more entertained than I was by this film.  However turning a play into a successful movie usually requires significant adaptation and changes to conform to both the medium as well as the audiences expectations.

In this case, Israel Horovitz , the playwright, chose to not only do the adaptation himself by writing the movie script but also by directing the film.  While he may have succeeded in creating a movie that adheres to his vision and standards, it may not appeal to all viewers.

Despite having the talented and very watchable  Maggie Smith, Kevin Kline, and Kristin Scott Thomas as leads, I found this movie to be very tedious. Perhaps if Mr. Horovitz had trusted others to adapt and direct his play, the movie would have turned out much better.",1441670400,,820,4.666666666666667

In fact, it's a melancholy look at the life of a man who in anyone's eye's would be deemed  a loser. His life has been defined by a terrible incident that occurred during his childhood which he, understandably, could never get passed.

I love Paris, and I will watch any movie about Paris so I can see it again, maybe revisit some of the places I have been. Kristin Scott Thomas is a very fine actress. Of course her roles are limited because, being a woman, she is offered only certain kinds of parts. Both Mr. Kline and Ms. Scott Thomas speak beautiful French. It's lovely to listen to. Maggie Smith, well, one cannot say enough about her acting, her panache, her livliness, her joie de vivre. What's not to like? Absolutely nothing. The story is sweet, and there are, sadly, very few sweet movies being made any longer -- I'm not talking about sappiness. I am talking sweetness here. There is a huge difference!

I disliked the old lady character. That old lady made such a mess of things for others for decades and yet she had the gall to think that all was well and her hands were clean. Yes, there are people who walk the earth that are exactly like this character... and they seem to live forever.

This movie is fodder for my growing distrust of ""matrimony"". The movie illustrates the effects on adult children for years to come.
At least, I learned about the interesting Viager system in France and my desire to learn more indepth about wines was rekindled. :)

It was OK, not great and not bad. It had a few sensitive moments that made me misty eyed. But there was something missing in this movie. I am not sure what but something was missing.

6812439,3,B00PK7HXDU,"This movie should have been more enjoyable.  How does a director take an all star cast and make a mediocre movie?  Kevin Kline's character was whinny, selfish and irritating.  Kristen Scott Thomas's character was  bitchy and unlikeable and just plain mean spirited.  The actors played grown children in their 50's who had never dealt with the fact they felt unloved by their parents. Kevin Klines character recounts 2-3 failed marriages and an inability to write the great American novel.  Ms. Scott-Thomas's character has never married, lives with her mother, and is employed by a company forced to keep her employed because of an agreement with one of her parents.  I'm sorry, if you have reached your 50's and have not dealt with your feelings about your parents, then I would suggest some serious therapeutic intervention.  Three-fourths of the way thru the movie, we finally see some redeeming qualities in both, but by then it was too late for me.  Maggie Smith played her part to perfection, as we have all come to expect of this fantastic actor.
This movie never seemed to know where it was going or whether it was a comedy, a drama  or both.  The scenery was great, and I kept asking myself, why don't I care about these two people?  I guess the actors are only as good as the direction, and this director was either confused or overwhelmed working with these extraordinary actors.",1440806400,,1390,4.794117647058823

6812449,4,B00PK7HXDU,"The three principal actors, Kevin Kline, Maggie Smith and Kristen Scott carry the story. What starts as humerous skullduggery in connection with a multimillion dollar Paris apartment turns into a story of possible redemption. Worth a look for the acting. Note: in the plot, Maggie Smith has a form of life estate in a Paris apartment : A life estate pur autre (""for the life ""). So she holds the apartment for her life and at her death Kevin Kline's character inherits the apartment from the estate of Kline's father. In addition, Maggie Smith is also owed 'rent' from Kline as successor to his father's estate. The reason for this is not clear but it could be for a variety of reasons: For example, perhaps Smith kept the life estate and sold the future remainder estate to Kline's father based on his promise to pay  a lump sum each month ('rent') during her lifetime. In any event, enjoy the comedy and suspend complete understanding of this point.",1440720000,,951,4.6946107784431135

6812453,5,B00PK7HXDU,Finally a movie with depth!  Trying to choose between films for a quiet night in takes a long time.  Most all choices are shallow and meaningless.  This film is about life as it is.  One struggles as the character struggles and joy is the gift at the end for us all.,1440633600,,266,4.1568627450980395
6812454,5,B00PK7HXDU,"I just watched the whole movie and cannot understand why some gave 1 star as it should be more, well, watch yourself and decide.  The movie is based on a play.  The story goes that a seemingly unaccomplished spoiled middle-aged man inherited from his wealthy father an apartment in Paris.  He goes there eager to sell the property for cash, and yet unraveled the past wounds and his father's secret pasts.  I thought it'd be a light-hearted movie, but it's rather a dark comedy - yet it reflects deeper issues in family relationships and even how different cultures confront love and betrayal in different ways.  It's not a fast paced movie, but a worthy story to dwell upon.",1440633600,,675,4.686440677966102

I am not sure even what I wanted from it,  but I was left wanting something more. It is hard to describe the movie.  I guess you could say it is a character study.  Kevin Kline inherits an apartment in Paris from his father.  When he gets there to check out the  apartment he finds it is inhabited by an old woman and her daughter.  There is a strange arrangement whereby the woman is able to live there for her entire life and Kevin is going to have to pay her a monthly fee (even if he is not living there)  It revolves around these three people.

Yet this powerful film shows how deeply others are affected when infidelity complicates and compromises families, and how lives are altered forever by this most selfish of acts.  I enjoyed watching this film so much because there is a happy and redeeming ending to an otherwise crazy plot filled with twists and turns that keep you guessing right down to the end.  True to her Downton Abbey role as Lady Grantham, Maggie Smith is brilliant once again, and Kevin Kline is right there with her.  They play off each other very well.

6812755,2,B00PK7HXDU,"Let's see. The movie is about a man who is . . . well let's face it . . . a loser. He shows up in Paris at an old ""apartment"" as they call it even though it is a multi-level house with a garden and large gated front. He is there to claim it as his dad left it to him. He arrives and finds out about some rare peculiar French law that allows the original owner to stay in the place and the new owner has to pay them to live there. If the original owner happens to die then you get it out-right like any other sale and can sell it again, live in it, or whatever. But in this case the lady is a 92 year old woman who seems to be holding on for another century. One thing leads to another. He falls for the old woman's daughter. They live happily ever after.

The problem is he finds out that his dad had had a long affaire with this old woman. So the tragic circumstances of his life seem to now make sense. He blames this old woman. Well about 3/4 of the way through the movie somehow their twisted reasoning places the blame on his mother for ruining him. The old woman becomes a matriach. All is good so they want us to think because you know all French sleep around and are guilty of adultery--that is what we are told. So the movie is just a weird take on some weird strange French real estate law. That is it. That is the big deal about this movie. Some eccentric real estate law. The rest is just immoral, amoral garbage. I mean there isn't even any eye candy aside from the cramped house. Kevin Kline actually looks like his character--a 50s drunk who lived hard and is almost a basket case mentally. Kristen Scott Thomas was never appealing and you pack a few decades of wear and tear on her . . . well it goes without saying she looks like her character--a school marmish old woman who has done nothing with her life. Maggie Smith is just old.",1438473600,,1850,4.068493150684931

6812780,2,B00PK7HXDU,"Waaah, waah, waah. Think Janis Joplin's song, ""Cry Baby"" and you'll get it.
Kind of surprised to see Kevin Kline in the roll of crybaby. I know some people will think it's a soul searching or revealing look at a grown up - - in his 40's, who wasn't connected to his Dad. Turns out his Dad had an affair with the woman living in the apartment that Kline's character inherits from his mostly absent father, after the father dies.
A tiring movie, slow paced, drawn out agony. Kline's character, whose name escapes me - - needs a good spanking. Put on your big boy shirt and get real. Your problems were created by the choices you made in your miserable life, not because your father wasn't there to hold your hand growing up. Do you know how many military families, (mostly wives) raise their families with largely absent fathers? Yes, it's tough and sorry you didn't have a strong mother. I can empathize to a point and then it's time to change the direction of your life and make it better. To drown yourself in alcohol until you are in your 40's is ridiculous.
Obviously, I did not enjoy this movie. It's a pity party that you don't want to attend.",1438214400,2,1148,4.419811320754717

6812922,3,B00PK7HXDU,A little to long with a predictable plot.,1437264000,,41,4.25
6812923,1,B00PK7HXDU,"I couldn't make it past a half hour, a totally wasted half hour. A man, Jim, inherits from his father an apartment in Paris. The purchase by his father was similar to what we would call a reverse mortgage  the seller continues to live in the apartment for life and receives a monthly annuity; upon her death, free and clear ownership transfers to the buyer (or, as in this case, his heir). But Jim hasn't got the money to pay her annuity; what to do? Jim goes to a real estate agent and finds out that a similar apartment, though without the garden his apartment enjoys, is on sale for 12 million (around $13 million), so his apartment is worth more than that  quite simply, a fortune. So what does he do? He pawns pieces of furniture from the apartment, furniture which may not even be his  he may be guilty of grand larceny, though the film does not even mention this. What he does not do is go to a French attorney, or a bank, or an investment company, to sell his interest in the apartment. Unless there is some French law forbidding it, reverse mortgages can be readily sold to investors. Of course the apartments value is diminished by the indenture  that is, the right of the seller to live in it for life and receive an annuity. But as this seller is a 92-year-old woman, the apartment subject to her rights is still worth millions. In other words, Jim is fabulously rich, yet acts as if he is poor, indeed as if the apartment is a terrible burden rather than the windfall it is. I find it very difficult to feel great sympathy for the very rich, even the very stupid very rich. In this movie Kevin Klein, as Jim, is both very rich and very very stupid. A total waste of time.",1437264000,,1684,4.319620253164557
6812924,4,B00PK7HXDU,Maggie Smith is always entertaining. I enjoyed the story and portrayal by the actors very much. The glimpse into the family lives of those effected by adultery was well written. The subtle comedy throughout made it even better.,1437264000,,227,5.0
6812925,4,B00PK7HXDU,i liked the movie. the story was good. the only problem was believing Kevin Kline was in his 50's. come on we all know he is much older (mid to late 60's).,1437264000,,155,3.875

6812954,4,B00PK7HXDU,"It was wonderfully acted, but the story was not as advertised in the trailer. So just be careful; it's an intense drama w/ hints of moral ambiguity and a dollop of possible incest, dressed in a ""Lady Killers"" comedic bow.  The preview is pretty much all of the humor in the film. I enjoyed the cast as they chew hard through a dry script. A good watch if you don't want to think about plot, while also making yourself feel better that other people are way more dysfunctional than you & your family.

It's hard to say much more w/o spoilers. But if you're willing to take the dive, it's a decent waste of hours.",1437177600,,610,4.2956521739130435

6813029,4,B00PK7HXDU,"More of a character study  than a film, this ""chamber"" dramedy seems to be a play on film using real sets instead of painted scenery.  Maggie Smith is a widow living in France in an apartment she once owned, but now has tenancy for the rest of her life. Kevin Kline is the new owner who inherited it from his father and wants the old woman out so he can sell the place. Kristin Scott Thomas is the old lady's daughter who wants him out. And it seems much like Jean-Paul Sartre's ""No Exit"" with a few smiles in which each person is making the other's life a living hell.
The film is surprisingly amiable. I recommend it.",1436745600,,619,4.237288135593221

6813032,4,B00PK7HXDU,"A thoughtful, well-framed look at a man and a woman whose lives have been greatly diminished if not ruined by the extramarital love affair of his father and her mother.  Mathias Gold is played by Kevin Kline, a failed writer brought down by his alcoholism and hatred for a father who neglected him and his mother in favor of a long-term affair with Madame Girard, Maggie Smith.
The down and out Mathias inherits an apartment  in Paris, but when he arrives to liquidate his inheritance, he finds it still very much inhabited by Mdm, Girard and her daughter Chloe (Kristin Scott Thomas). It seems Mathias father has purchased the apartment from his former mistress under a ""viager"" agreement. Not only can the destitute Mathias not sell the valuable property, he must pay a monthly fee to his ""Old Lady"" just to keep from losing it.
The much damaged and none-too-likable Mathias and the less damaged Chloe must reexamine their lives and salvage what they can from their parent's affair that has left such a confusing and cluttered relationship for them to resolve.
The pace may be a bit slow for some. Be patient. Watch it as you would a stage production, and you won't be disappointed by splendid performances from Kline, Smith, and Scott-Thomas..",1436745600,,1246,4.817757009345795

That would be fine if those weighty subjects were handled with any degree of grace or insight. Instead they are clumsily dropped onto viewers who make the mistake of expecting a witty trip to Paris. The movie is clumsy in other ways too, from a preposterous romance that begins with a man walking in on a woman in the toilet, to stagey dialogue that shows too clearly that the script began as a play.

6813145,3,B00PK7HXDU,"Oh sure every once in a while Hollywood or somebody puts out a quirky little film like the one under review, My Old Lady  (an unfortunate term for the title since my frame of reference for the term, and the central male characters as well stems from the 1960s when the term was used as a term of endearment, I guess, for your wife or girlfriend who most certainly was not an old lady since we did not recognize anybody over thirty and we would not have, in my circle anyway, called dear old mother such a term). Quirky? Well yes because it addresses in a semi-comical way what we now all know is a truism. That the battle, the inter-generational battle, we 50 and 60 somethings fought against our parents (and all authority) in the 1960s and early 1970s (that dear old mother over thirty who we did not recognize in our universe) never did really end, at least in some households.

Here is what I mean. Mathias (played by Kevin Kline), a broke, broken down refugee from the 60s, is heir to a luxurious apartment in Paris (there are other luxurious apartments in the world although not in Paris but that setting makes this film work a little better) left by his now deceased father whom, well, lets say they didn't get along. And Mathias has the three divorces and the shrink bills to prove it, prove he was unloved by his father. So our man spends his last Euros to get to Paris and sell the unit and maybe get his twenty-seventh fresh start in life (if those ex-wives don't find out about his current good fortune). Problem, problem number one is that he cannot sell the damn thing while one Mathilde is alive and well (she a British national who has lived in Paris since Django Reinharts time played, played naturally, by that age old institution Maggie Smith who has lost a step or seven since her Prime of Miss Jean Brodie days).

See Mathias father and Mathilde were lovers (while both we married to others, Mathias mother committing suicide over the matter) and he set her up in the apartment giving her, under an old French custom, a life tenancy in the place. So our boy has to not only look at the actuarial tables but figure out a way to get the old lady out and big dough into his hands. Now. Oh yeah, did I say that the old lady had a daughter, Chloe, a fetching daughter (played by Kristen Scott Thomas of The English Patient fame) who also wants to stay since she grew up in the place and has no place else to go. Chloe naturally takes an instant hate to the reckless and feckless Mathias.

But you know what is going to happen, know as sure as you know the father was not a good guy (although Mathildes take on him is obviously different even if he left her high and dry after his wife killed herself). Hollywood or something will trot out the old tried and true boy meets girl formula and they will get together. Not only that but dear sweet Mathilde will get to finish her days in her old place. And maybe, just maybe that battle Mathias had with his father will be resolved when somebody tries to buy the place when he is Maggies age. Yes, quirky, quirky indeed.",1435708800,3,3080,4.360627177700349

6813242,4,B00PK7HXDU,I really enjoyed this movie.  The story helps us understand the differences between generations and how this tends to affect our lives. The concept of marriage and love as well as parenting was very different for people in the early 1900's as to those born in the mid 1900's.  I would recommend this particular movie because the acting is really credible and good.  It helps us as viewers to question our own experience with our upbringing and to find the compassion and understanding for ourselves and our own parents. Enjoy!,1434758400,,526,4.822222222222222
6813243,3,B00PK7HXDU,"Well acted, beautiful scenery, and a somewhat satisfying resolution. But the previews don't really reveal the dark depths of suffering that this movie goes through.

6813253,5,B00PK7HXDU,"Kevin Kline, Maggie Smith and Kristin Scott Thomas - this trio should attract viewers who know good acting when they see it.  All three of these excellent actors have appeared in in ""big-budget"" block busters as well as independent films that become block busters - not because of aggressive studio marketing or fat budgets, but because the mere mention of their names attracts film aficionados.  This story educates the viewer on the ""ins and outs"" of French real estate laws - that in itself is intriguing, then add to that the family entanglements between the 3 characters, and you've got a screen play that won't let you out of it's grip.  It seems a simple story about life, love and loss, but becomes a reflection of relationships that we can recognize in our own lives, and understand at a deeper level by the experience of watching My Old Lady.

6813381,1,B00PK7HXDU,It was more like a bad stage production than a movie. Not even Maggie Smith could get this derailed train back on the tracks. Boring and don't get me started on Kevin Kline. It's about 107 minutes of my life I can't get back.,1433808000,,225,4.136363636363637

6813390,3,B00PK7HXDU,"Overacted by the very talented Kevin Klein, in that he was constantly drinking from one wine bottle after another but not falling down drunk. After downing three consecutive bottles of good French red wine he would at times slur and at other times demonstrate great cunning; it was enough of an incongruity that it detracted mightily from the integrity of the storyline. It was meant to be a dark movie and it had an interesting underlying plot but even though the acting was good it simply didn't hold together well enough to be riveting (which it could have been). All in all I'd have to say it was a failed effort, held together only by the sheer strength of its actors.",1433808000,,673,4.570247933884297

6813400,5,B00PK7HXDU,"This movie made me laugh a number of times, but a comedy it is not.  The movie's one weakness is that Kevin Kline pontificates with bottle in hand, just a bit much. While I can believe that the alchohol induced verbal onslaught is emotionally penetrant, I resist wanting to see him extemporizing while drinking directly from the bottle, one realizes the directors need to bring the latter part of the movie to a creshendo. It's not as rough going as Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in: -Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf?- but is still powerful,

The acting is superb. The story line is elegant and believable. I rarely come across such a combination of positive attributes.  One caveat - if you don't like English movies, for what ever reason, don't bother. The movie ends on an upbeat note, but not the smarmy upbeat conclusion of your typical American movie.",1433721600,,861,4.76510067114094

The setting is beautiful and also something I'm unfamiliar with. This movie is better than sightseeing in Paris because you'd never see the personal, one of a kind items and settings, nor the multiple periods of time that are explored.

6813457,4,B00PK7HXDU,"An offbeat, charming, and thought provoking  movie. It's lighthearted and amusing, but also touching in a restrained and realistic way. The title suggests a crassness which is entirely misleading. This movie is quiet, nuanced, and sophisticated. The viewer should enjoy the fine acting, the intelligent script, and the atmospheric lighting and directing. A bonus is the interesting street views of Paris and glimpses into interiors, which are worth paying attention to.",1433721600,,469,5.605633802816901

6813459,5,B00PK7HXDU,"I started watching the film  because it starred Kevin Kline and Maggie Smith and I love them both.  I stayed glued to the screen because the story was wonderfully human and the cinematography captivatiing. Who could argue with marvelous romance, set in Paris, and beautiful, not just visually, but also in the subtle way it weaves a rich fabric of family, love, life, suffering and death around the main character ( played by Kevin Kline)  who arrives to collect and inheritance and ends up with much much more.  No spoilers here.  Go watch it for  yourself. You won't be sorry.",1433721600,3,578,4.73

6813463,4,B00PK7HXDU,"This happened to be a surprising find for us. We had little expectation of what a gem this movie turned out to be. It got little attention, if any, in the marketplace the year of its release, but we found this little tale of twists and turns, reflection, deflection and resolution quite thought provoking. We often carry such extraordinary baggage from our past, whether it be recent or early childhood. This movie deals with such childhood experience and the memories of it in such a way to elicit remarkable moments of reflection which cause us to truly feel something from the characters. Kline and Thomas were surprising compelling, and as always, Maggie Smith is a true gem.",1433721600,,679,4.811965811965812

The story was good, (and the setting was Paris) but I felt that some of the dramatic parts where drawn out too far, to where they lost the intended effect. The actors, and I include the French actors here, are excellent actors, but the characters they portrayed were perhaps a bit stereotypical. Of course, that is only my subjective option. Overall, it was a good movie.",1433289600,,441,4.390243902439025

6813521,4,B00PK7HXDU,Unusual story and so different. We enjoyed it's quirkiness. Kevin Kline is a really good actor in this movie and who can dispute the draw that Maggie Smith brings to any movie!  You will be amazed at the weird rental ways of the French which give reason and the plot substance. This is poignant and humorous but it is not a comedy.

Maggie Smith is also a sure bet, she is the most believable actress working. I liked the premise, I liked the story and I liked the actors. The story may have come across better as a play; the transformation of Kline's character in the movie was unconvincing.

6813589,4,B00PK7HXDU,"Kevin Kline is that down-on-his-luck ex-patriot looking to cash in on an inherited apartment in France. But the French have their own way of doing things and he cannot sell until the tenant leaves or dies and must pay rent until she does so. That tenant, played by the excellent Maggie Smith proves to be more than just an obstacle. Toss in Kristin Scott Thomas as Smith's daughter and Kline faces an uphill battle to exact something from the father he has mostly been estranged from.

The conflict certainly could have been turned into a much different kind of story especially with someone like Kline who is adept at comedy. But My Old Lady sets a different tone and unearths a twisted set of relationships between Kline's family and Smith's. This is a character study as each person unveils another layer, another connection, another mystery revealed.",1432944000,,854,4.8493150684931505

The movie starts out in a promising way, but you come to find out that the main character is a tortured and sometimes nasty soul with broken marriages and trauma in his past.  It could have worked better if they could have left out the suicide, blackmail and infidelity elements in the story.  Yes, I suppose there are real people in this world that have to deal with such crisis in their lives, but that doesn't mean I want to pay to see it.  I love Kevin Kline, but his character comes across as whiny and unlikeable.

6813750,3,B00PK7HXDU,"The film was somewhat uneven and incorrectly characterized as a ""comedy"". Although there were some funny moments delivered by the incomparable Maggie Smith, the story revolves around the rather unlikeable character depicted by Kevin KIine. Kline gives an excellent performance as the self-pitying, alcoholic, son of a cold father, but the screenwriter's and director's attempt to fit this characterization into a humorous context just didn't work for me.",1431820800,,454,5.6911764705882355

The theme is rather depressing and full of despair.  The resurgence of caring and mental growth is quite satisfying.  Everyone has personal flaws but these folks certainly had more than their share.  Without the outcome the movie would have been one I would not have wished to view.  I recommend this movie for only the older mature audience.  It is not a children's or teenager's movie at all.  Don't think it is a feel good movie because it is not.  However, it will enable one to appreciate what they have in life.  The movie is a study of people that you will feel have hope.

6813760,4,B00PK7HXDU,"Potential spoilers.  57-year old Mathias ""Jim"" Gold (Kevin Kline) is a broke New Yorker who has just spent his last few dollars on a trip to Paris.  There he expects to take possession of a large apartment, with a garden, nestled in prime real estate near the River Seine.  His estranged father had died and left no money, but did will the apartment, a gold watch and some French literature to the son.  Mathias hopes to make a quick sale on the desirable, if a bit dilapidated, complex and get on with his life.  The apartment comes with complications of course.

An elderly woman, Mathilde Girard (Maggie Smith) is a resident.  Most of the first act deals with Mathilde explaining to Mathias that the building is under a legal agreement called a ""viager.""  Essentially, Mathias's father bought the building from Ms. Girard, but she is allowed to live there and collect an endowment of $2400 Euros a month, until her death.  So, not only does ownership come with certain restrictions, but comes with unexpected expenses as well.  These early scenes with Kline and Smith are terrific.  The tone is set for some light adult comedy, fueled later when we find the similarly aged daughter, Chloe (Kristin Scott Thomas) also lives with her mother.

The film takes a turn midway when Mathais, bunking in one of the vacant rooms, discovers some photographs of his father and Mathilde together.  This leads to a secrets of their lives unknown to Mathias.  Chloe, doesn't want the apartment sold because the only investor interested wants to convert the property to a hotel.  Plus, she's always lived there.  I have to question why the film took such a dark turn, unraveling a few too many secrets from the past involving all concerned.

Yet the performances and dialog are first rate.  Another plus is that the film was shot on location in Paris and we get to see sides of the city that don't include the Eiffel Tower, The Louvre and other noted landmarks.  One of my favorite scenes involves a young woman singing something from Mozart's ""Don Giovanni"" on one side of the river.  Mathias is strolling on the other side, observes the women for a few seconds and then joins her in duet.  Kline is a graduate of Indiana University's School of Music and Art, so no surprise he could pull this off.  Full disclosure: A plug for my alma mater.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Like the film, there is some unevenness to the display.  Some of the darker scenes seem a bit murky to me.  Not unwatchable mind you, just noticeable.  On the other hand the shots of various Parisian architecture are picture perfect.  Wonderful detail on stone and brick, flowers and pots.  Beautiful.  Black levels are OK, colors very good.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is fairly straight forward.  Nothing special in this dialog centric film.  Clear and properly located.  While the surrounds don't do much, we do get small details like an out-of-tune piano, footsteps and the gentle waves of the river splashing ashore.  The only extra is Annette Insdorf's Interview with Kevin Kline and Israel Horovitz (director, playwright, and screenwriter).",1431734400,,3172,4.800369685767098

Kevin Kline is amazing playing the complicated, lovable, and honest Mathias Gold who inherits an apartment in Paris occupied by Mathilde and Chlo Girard (her daughter). The story, setting, direction, and cinematography are excellent. The movie draws you into the intimate psychological details of the lives of the characters. When it is over you feel like they are your family members who you cannot help but love and cherish for sharing their story.

I found little to nothing to like in Kevin Klein's character who seemed anxious to take advantage of the elderly previous owner of his recently inherited Paris flat.

Pro:  Kevin KLein, Maggie Smith and Kristin Scott give admirable performances worthy of their caliber.
Con: 1.  there is quite a bit of french conversation with NO subtitles.  if you don't know french, you don't know what you missed.  they are mostly arguements.  2.  the sudden and repeated drinking of whole bottles of wine by Kevin Klein seems out of character since he doesn't do it before or after the drinking bout.",1431648000,,673,4.6923076923076925

It touches on alcoholism, depression, loss and loneliness but manages not to be so negative that it is unwatchable.  On the contrary, was fun to watch lots of humor and drama. Initially was a successful play, but has a great cast and manages to feel like a movie rather than a play.

I'm a huge Kevin Kline fan and he pulls off another great drama/comedy role.  If you like Kevin Kline you probably won't be disappointed.

6813856,3,B00PK7HXDU,"This is another of those films where all the funny bits made it into the previews, leaving nothing to surprise the viewer in the actual film, aside from the fact that it's not nearly as funny as one was led to believe.  ""Blue Jasmine"" worked this to the nth degree, but ""My Old Lady"" isn't nearly so grim, and Paris gets much better treatment than San Francisco did.

Mathias Gold (Kline) has inherited a house and garden from his late father, in the fashionable Marais district of Paris.  The problem is, according to a long standing French legal arrangement, the house comes with Maggie Smith (which would seem to be something of a dream come true, at least for a while) playing a 91 year old english woman, Mathilde Girard, who'd sold the house to the elder Mr. Gold, after her husband had died.

Forty one years ago.

As part of the deal, the late Mr. Gold was to pay Mme Girard twenty four hundred euros a month until her death, at which time he could claim the house.  Unfortunately, Mr. Gold has now died, and Mme Girard is still going strong.  And Mr. Gold the younger, a middle aged man himself, has sold everything he has to get to Paris, where he had intended to sell the damn house and live off the proceeds.

Life has other plans...

It turns out that Mr. Gold has issues regarding his dad, and his dad's cheating on his mother.  It also happens that the house has secrets, and one of them has to do with Mme Girard, and her daughter, who lives with her.  Working out Mr. Gold's issues and the house's secrets is where the movie keeps the meat of the story, little of which proves funny, and only adds to the drama as the story moves along.  Kevin Kline gets to put his acting chops on full display and it's rather impressive.

So the viewer goes in expecting a comedy, gets tricked into a fairly decent drama, and the entire experience is rather rewarding.  What really makes the film though is its low key atmosphere (similar in many ways to ""Blue Jasmine""s finer moments) and the music which sets and holds the tone.  It's a beautiful if well worn world these people inhabit inside the house, and of course, it's Paris every time they step out the door.  The movie is quietly simmering with activity.

All in all a very nice way to pass an afternoon.",1431302400,30,2266,4.408653846153846

A quirky, intelligent but absolutely plausible storyline from that genre doesn't come along often, but when it does, one hopes it will also have Maggie Smith, Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas. All deliver solid performances and you can see why they signed onto this movie. Real adults meet, fall in love and often muck it up for their kids, even when they have the best of intentions. This movie has a lot of moving parts, even as it is solely set in one neighborhood of Paris.

Mostly I give this film one star b/c iI felt it was falsely represented.  The cover says ""Funny, fresh and original,"" and the back says nothing about the darkness  of the film.  There is so much reference to suicide.  It was too dark for me, and I think the dvd synopsis should have given a little more insight into the real plot.",1431043200,2,463,4.337209302325581

The story moves slowly, but you are introduced to an interesting conflict between two societies (i.e., French and American) over a contract as well as piqued over the unfolding tale of two families intertwined in very complex ways. We enjoyed the foreign scenery, the excellent music, and the relatively deep insights on living that the movie provided, especially toward the end. When we watched this, we were tired after working all day. We found the slower pace quite helpful in following the nuances of the plot. In a day when excitement and explosions constantly fill the screen, we were pleasantly surprised with this movie's change of pace and reliance on deeper thoughts.

The three lead actors do a great job in their roles, but this is a feel-good movie only on the most superficial level.  The story is much more about the devastation wrecked on two innocents by self-righteous narcissistic parents - symbolized excellently my none other than Maggie Smith. The story balances with several points of harmless humor but most of the message is on the dreary side.  It's a thought-provoking story and is very well presented.

Though I had lived in Paris, albeit never as a homeowner, I had never heard of the 'for the lifetime' property purchase option they have. I had to look it up to make sure it was kosher, and it was. Good movie. Nicely shot and well produced. Captures the non-tourist, day-to-day life of Paris and I can vouch for that. 18 years of living/visiting Paris on a year basis. Watch it. You will not regret it. Enjoy.",1430611200,,469,4.465116279069767

6814040,5,B00PK7HXDU,"This movie feels like it has been written by someone who as an adult shares his feelings that bleed from memories
of a childhood scarred by growing up in the marriage that although seemingly normal, was affected by father's
infidelity that the movie introduced indirectly and only through the memories and conversation of an adult
man who is taken by surprise when he learns details and people responsible for his scared chaldhood,
who in turn seem and remind indifferent to them untill they learn how deeply his life was affected by
seemingly innocent romance / extramartial affair of two married people..

This movie will be appreciated by anyone who does appreciate the deep emotionally captivating
filmography that speaks to the heart and mind equally. But this movie will be even more appreciated
by anyone who has ever been affected by infidelity in any way, either as a child who's paren'ts
had some issues of that sort, or as an adult who commited any infidelity or is contemplating one..
This movie shows many levels of humanity, many levels of a human and it beautifully
voices an inner child within an adult.

Watching it is like an amazing and awesome psychoterapy without a boaring shring and without actual hefty bill.

I want to be Kristin Scott Thomas when I grow up, shes so fine (unfortunately I'm old so that's not going to happen).  I couldn't take my eyes off Kevin Kline he's so perfect in his imperfections, a flawed character one can't help but love.  And the wonderful Dame Maggie Smith in all her glory is a love to watch, watch her close, she's up to something.

The story grabs your emotions from the beginning and doesn't let go.  I laughed, I cried, I hissed, I cheered, and ultimately I went away having loved every minute of it.  Yes it is a slow moving film, but that's what I prefer when watching human stories. The clues drop softly like flower petals, the layers peel away, the adversaries come around, and the (not so) subtle manipulator (Dame Maggie) moves everyone to her will.

6814083,4,B00PK7HXDU,"My Old Lady began slowly, and was a little difficult during the beginning third because it depended mainly on an effective performance by Kevin Klein of a truly obnoxious man. He was incorrigible and whinging in almost every respect, and in an environment that was disagreeable to him, namely Paris. The fact that we find Paris enchanting didn't help his case. Initially the characters portrayed by the wonderful Maggie Smith, and Kirsten Scott Thomas have similar reactions to him as we did. They find him unbearable. But as details of their pasts begin to be revealed, the movie becomes much more human and interesting. Soon the pasts show themselves to be very interwoven, memories engage, and the relationships between the characters begin to formulate, and a context for Klein's behavior becomes clearer. This small, quiet movie ends on a much warmer note that reconciles many of the conflicts, but leaves a satisfyingly realistic number of loose ends to be resolved by the characters after the movie ends.",1430352000,,1011,5.059880239520958

6814108,4,B00PK7HXDU,"This was a clever concept. I was unfamiliar with the French real estate practice of en viager, buying a property but paying rent to the current owner until he or she dies. The plot uses the concept well as a complicating factor when a ne'er do well artist arrives in Paris to claim his inheritance. He discovers eventually that the woman who lives in the apartment has the right to stay there all her life. Not only that, she must be paid every month.

The plot is twisted even more by the fact of a hidden affair and the woman's daughter's presence. The ensuing excitement gets quite complicated and ends in a fashion more common in American films than French ones.

I loved the other two actresses but I saw no reason for the heroine to fall for Klein's very unlikable character. Whether it was his fault or the fault of the director,  Klein's character was an over-the-top, self-pitying victim. Stereotypically American, as well, and very few positive qualities.

6814134,3,B00PK7HXDU,"Given the usual brilliance of Kristin Scott-Thomas,  Kevin Kline and the magnifcent Maggie Smith I expected more. The plot was gimmicky, based as it was on an obscure French legal twist about the sale and transfer of real estate. I get that it is the pivot point of the plot is that quirky law that brings these three pros together to sort out their past secrets but it sort of wheeled around, diverged here and there with the inevitable being obvious that the two wounded people would reposition their lives to heal one another and somehow fall in love. Ordinarily I would watch Scott-Thomas reading the Toldeo telephone directory, but her dowdy, irresolute lost middle aged lady didn't work for me. She is too beautiful to believe as having reached her early middle age only to have a lover who cheats on his wife to choose from. Hard to believe nobody had scooped her up long before. Kevin Kline's role as a life-long loser is also a bit hard to swallow as authentic. How damaged could he have been into his 60's by a cold, distant father who  he learns from Maggie Smith, actually did love him--funny way of showing it. He was long past his sell by stage of life and collapsed into a broken loser for no more apparent reasons that that? I didn't buy it. However watching three great actors struggling through this dull excercise still kept me watching till the inevitable ending when it dawns on Kline that Kristin-Thomas is available. The presumption that they were an age appropriate couple also was questionable. She seemed maybe 7 or 8 years too young for him. Overall a shrug but a nice one.",1430265600,,1600,4.610526315789474
6814135,3,B00PK7HXDU,"Wonderful acting, but story not as strong: i could not believe Kevin Klein's character, a man stony broke after three unsuccessful marriages, who seems never to have achieved anything in his life (he is well past first youth) could solve all his problems by falling in love with Kristen Scott-Thomas' character.  He had revealed himself as petty, unaccomplished, deceitful - he secretly took things from the house to sell in an unsuccessful attempt to keep his head above water.",1430265600,,478,5.050632911392405

Watching him portray a depressed middle aged man whining and sucking on a wine bottle was just too much to endure.  His acting was so poor even his drinking of wine was not believable.  A character developed upon the premises of a grown man who has taken no responsibility for his life, and is still blaming everything on the perceived failings of his father is simply boring, over done and a sad waste of time and resources.

6814170,2,B00PK7HXDU,"All Star cast, but missed the mark. The promotional trailer led me to believe this was a comedy, but the dialogue seemed plodding and mishandled from the start. A spoiler alert: Kline plays the part of a recovering alcoholic, yet his character spends much of the movie unattractively smashed. I got the sense he was trying for funny-drunk, but to me if was unconvincing and uncomfortable. A shame, because with a little pathos and timing, his character could have been more credible and given the film some much-needed depth. This movie was billed as a comedy and directed as a sensitive drama, but it ended up falling short of both.

For some reason he has to pay the resident a monthly amount of money until she passes on. I don't know why,maybe I was in the kitchen and missed it. Anyway he can't sell the place until she dies. If that were not enough; Kevin finds out that his dad had a long term fling with Maggie in years past. He had father issues with the old man before he found out about the affair and this did not help one bit.

6814231,4,B00PK7HXDU,It was interesting for insights.  The couple that were cheating on their spouses had no clue as to how it affected other people.  And a couple of the characters were so self-involved.  A good movie but annoying in parts.,1429833600,,220,4.589743589743589

This is a bittersweet story with surprising depth involving the revelations, struggles, and complicated relationships encountered when Kline's father dies and leave him a French apartment, occupied and previously owned by Smith. Tragedy brings them together in sympathetic understandings on more than one level, and yields an emotionally satisfying, if completely unusual, tale of secrets and betrayals.

6814344,3,B00PK7HXDU,Interesting plot I thought. Kevin Kline's father willed him a very nice and large Parisian apartment and being in serious need of some cash flow he makes the trip to sell it. Things aren't what he assumed and he finds there are tenants and a rather inconvenient and disappointing catch. As the story progresses we find there is a disturbing connection between Kline and the tenants. There are some spots of comedy but the undercurrent of this movie is not comical in the least. At first we believe Kline to be a directionless and friendless alcoholic and we aren't feeling any empathy for him. Maggie Smith's character seems to have a certain affection for him but believes he has wasted his life for no good reason. Her daughter also appears somewhat compromised. We find as we get further into the movie that there are indeed some very tragic reasons for Kline's behavior and to a lesser degree for Kristen Scott Thomas's issues as well.,1429488000,,939,4.7317073170731705

The point of the movie is crystalized in one of Kline's lines 'when you choose to follow your heart, you choose to break someone elses,'  Actions have consequences that we'd prefer to sweep under the rug.  This story looks at the destruction that a parent's selfishness reaps in their children's lives and how they've deceived themselves that little harm is actually done when they choose to cheat.  I am a grown child of divorce, and every time I hear adults remark at how 'resilient children are' in order to excuse themselves from the responsibility for scarring children, I recall how the pain of my parent's divorce and denials have lasted well into my mid fifties.

6814482,3,B00PK7HXDU,"My Old Lady sounded as if a span of bikers were sitting around and beefing on their wimmen. Anf Fellas, that is a good thing. It makes gals feel good when they are valued. Imagine my surprise then, when I read the text: Nope. This would not be about that stuff, this was supposed to be about second chances. I was suprised to find two of my favorite actors, Dame Smith and Mr. Klein.  I settled in for another goofy, part-swapping .full of antics and one liners which is typical Klein.
And then Dame Maggie set me straight.  Between little-old-lady-tea drinking, the Dame gave a beautiful and scathingly subtle performance of manipulation-by-generation.  It actually takes a while, not more than 5 minutes, before it's very clear whom is steering the developing situation towards victory.  Honestly, you have to watch the film to detect some of the finer machinations before deciding to back anyone!

We see snapshot memories, and gorgeous views of the Seine, the rooftops of Paris and surrounding areas.  As time between the encounters of prime characters expands and changes, the underlying tenets of a love triangle lost long ago, come to life to respond to the pleas the actors speak, and fate intervenes.  This isn't a silly, LOL sort of work for which Klein is best known.  Kristin Scott-Thomas adds just enough pathos to the mix to keep the levity under par.  Klein seemed to serve up the chuckles by playing a snide, cynical and a somewhat verbally abusive, belligerent  jerk.  Down on his luck at 57.11, he is broke, homeless and desperate,.  Seeking an inheritance paths cross and the story picks up some speed.  But, darn it all, there is still  ""His Old  Lady"".  Now what?
I don't think writing a review should be done without thinking what you are saying.  So upfront, I will say this is a cute, semi-precious stone of a quiet gem, but it just lacks some pure sparkle.  Often, especially on scenes which might have been more up beat, the faces and eyes weren't quite focused on what they were saying, a ""phoned-in"" performance.  Still, the end is predictable, but the energy wasn't all I have come to expect from Mr. Klein.  A quiet little film, I think the show stealer was definitely Dame Maggie Smith. Because I understand her perspective, far too well.  For a quiet eve at home, this will bore 12-20's, and smalls won't understand it.  Which means Mom and Dad can relax, and just enjoy the film.  I did.  *FLAP*",1429228800,,2428,4.699052132701421

It is not a light hearted romance but, rather, a story which demonstrates how the actions of people can have unforeseen and harmful consequences. The character played by Kevin Kline goes to Paris because he has just inherited a rather large and valuable apartment upon his father's death. It turns out, however, that an old lady (Maggie Smith) has been left a life estate interest in it, the right to live in it until she dies. It further turns out that she and the recently deceased had been longtime lovers. And so the complexity of emotions grows. A very worthwhile film, very well acted.",1429228800,,740,4.529850746268656

One or two implausible parts (e.g, financial support for the American) but for the most part, I was kept interested. Perhaps it was the strong role played by Maggie Smith and perhaps there were enough surprises to keep me wondering if my suspicions were correct. The inevitable linkage between the protagonist and the daughter of the woman who was his father's lover gave the story the positive outcome. Good questions raised about the impact.affairs on the children of the affair participants, the impact on the partners who experienced being cheated on, the impact of suicide, to name a few issues, were more than I ususlly get from film makers.",1429056000,,746,4.881889763779528

Ms. Smith and Ms. Thomas were both in a movie, Mr. Kline was doing theater. The movie has a quirky but interesting plot and at first you feel sorry for Kline's character's predicament but as the movie grinds on Kline only becomes more irritating to the point of just watching an unpleasing, narcissistic tantrum. The frustration had less to do with Kline's character and more to do with his overkill of the subject.

At the end of her life, she finds out why her lover of many years never came back to her after his wife's death, which was not the reason he had given her and that she had wanted to believe.  As far as Kevin Kline, I've never really thought him an exceptional actor until this movie.  He was so good in this movie that I'm now going to go back and try other movies he's starred in.  In ""My Old Lady,"" he was excellent at portraying a man who's been terribly disappointed in life and no longer expects anything good to come his way.

6814754,3,B00PK7HXDU,"Loved the cast -- anything with Dame Maggie Smith automatically deserves 3 stars in my book -- but Kline's overacting got to me toward the end. He's always been hammy, but the drinking scenes are so over-the-top as to be laughable. And that brings me to my main issue. Exaggerating gestures and postures is what a stage actor does to make sure the folks in th back rows can see. Onscreen it looks like an acting exercise in drama school. In fact, the whole thing is filmed too much like a play. The sets, camera angles, and so on seemed a direct translation from the stage. I realize the scenes are mostly interior and meant to feel close, or claustrophobic, but it could have been filmed differently to take advantage of what cinema adds to drama. This is what happens, I think, when the dramatist and stage director attempt to adapt his/her own work for the screen. The original version is so deeply embedded that she/he can't see anything else.",1428537600,,947,4.576470588235294

6814802,3,B00PK7HXDU,Not Bad. Kevin Kine had some good lines that were funny. Aactually a good message that adultery hurts the kids and the innocent marital partners.,1428364800,,145,4.84

6814883,3,B00PK7HXDU,"I had heard about this movie mostly through the Amazon site, so I was lucky to find it at the local library.  I'm glad I did because I certainly wouldn't buy this film.  While it was interesting to learn how a ""Viager"" works and what kind of impact it can have on the owners, I felt that a lot of this movie at least in the beginning was tiresome.  However, if one is patient enough it becomes clear why the characters act the way they do.

Kevin Kline plays a down on his luck middle aged guy who has never really grown up and has inherited this Paris property from his late father.  What a deal!  He hasn't a dime to his name, has exhausted three marriages, been in rehab for alcohol abuse, and generally hasn't had a real job for a long time--if ever.  His excitement soon dims when he finds out that this substantial building complete with garden is inhabited by a 90 year old woman(Maggie Smith)  who isn't going to budge.  She isn't the only inhabitant---she has a middle aged, single, bitter daughter who isn't going anywhere either and both of them are becoming Mattheis or Jim's nightmare.

I expected more humor in this movie but instead it is comprised of people who made bad decisions and those that were hurt by them.  The ones that are hurt have continued the vendetta against their parents and while the reasons are valid, you wish they would just grow up and move on.  In Jim's case his parental experience was very traumatic and revealing this to his counterpart(Kristin Scott Thomas) causes her to change her opinion of this angry, self-centered man.  It's notable here that Kristin Scott Thomas's second language is French and she displays this ability well in this movie as well as the more poignant film I've Loved You So Long.  Maggie Smith does her usual ""dowager"" role here and she plays those well.  For me though, I feel the talents of the actors here were wasted in this movie.  It also was dark which is my biggest complaint of most of the films these days---hard to see what's going on.

Personally I wouldn't recommend this movie.  If you want to see Kevin Kline, Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith shine----watch other movies that do them justice!",1427587200,,2181,4.5487179487179485

6814936,4,B00PK7HXDU,"This was listed as a ""Comedy"" but it certainly wasn't one.  The subject matter turned quite dark and the mood of the film never approached what I would consider the substance of a comedic movie.  However, it was a good movie.  It wasn't what we expected when we selected it, but it was still very good.  Kline keeps pace as a tormented and tortured soul, who tries to find humor, but unveils his tragic past as the reality of who the ""Old Lady"" he inherited really is to him.  The story unfolded well, sometimes predictable, but kept us engaged.  Kline and Maggie Smith present a formidable presence when on screen together, and they carry the film.

There were no jokes and the unpacking of these characters' emotional baggage can get heavy, but it is done in a fluid and engaging way that builds as the movie progresses.",1426464000,,822,4.551020408163265

6814945,2,B00PK7HXDU,"This will not be for all tastes.  First, it is not a comedy, though the dvd case suggests that it could be one.  It is a stage play that has become a movie.  The setup is that Kevin Kline is a thrice-divorced, penniless New Yorker who has inherited a Parisian apartment from his father.  Unfortunately, the apartment comes with a catch: an elderly woman (Maggie Smith) has a life interest in the property and the owner is required to pay her 2,400 Euros each month.  In their first interaction Maggie takes Klines gold watch as rent for the single room she allows him.  Her daughter lives there as well.  Unaware of her presence, Kline surprises her (Kristin Scott Thomas) while she is sitting on the toilet (=modern humor?).  Both Kline and Thomas performances tend to reflect their personalities.  Maggie Smith can be sprightly even when she is playing a dark character.  Kline and Thomas, on the other hand, seem to be sleepwalking or screaming in fairly wooden fashion.

All of the characters are unpleasant, though they eventually come to terms with their situation and, in effect, redefine their relationship.  The apartment is large and it is situated in the most fashionable section of Paris.  On the other hand, it is decayed and the faded glory is often shot in very low light, the dark apartment corresponding to the dark personalities of the central characters.  The fact that much of the dialogue is in French will prove problematic for many viewers.

For me the film was slow and frequently unpleasant.  When I see a film about a 9-million Euro apartment in the Marais I want a little more joy, a little more uplift and a little more light in the city that is known for it.",1426291200,,1687,4.667796610169492

It looked as if she and Kevin Kline would be hilarious.  Well, there are comic moments, but this is really a drama about people who are in a lot of emotional pain.  As Kristen Scott Thomas  and Kevin try to work it out, Maggie Smith's character offers countless bon mots, and unsolicited advice.  If you are a fan of these actors, as I am, it is worth seeing, but  do not expect a comedy.  I suspect it was promoted as a comedy in the trailers, and then the ""test preview audience"" was disappointed, and that is why it went straight to DVD, and not into the theaters",1425600000,,719,4.235294117647059

6815024,5,B00PK7HXDU,"This film begins as the story of an old woman squatting in a Paris apartment, and soon becomes a complicated tale of an old love affair that affected the lives of two families. Maggie Smith is wonderful as a cantankerous lady with dark secrets, and Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas are convincing as two adults who suddenly discover their parent(s) may not have been who they seemed.

He really has a rough time staying off the streets and eating too.  Along the way, he learns to love again and live again without so much worry and negativity.  How he gets there and learns to look at life differently is the subject of his long journey and conversion back to being a member of the human race.

I like the way the film showed the ripple effects that selfishness can cause.  I also liked to see a romance between older people in Hollywood.  It seems that all the movies about romance are reserved for people under 40 and imply that if you are a woman and you hit 40 say goodbye to romance.

If you're looking for an action movie, this is not it and you shouldn't watch it.  However, if you enjoy watching movies that unfold people's lives and how each event can give us another twist and surprise ending then I recommend you definitely watch this movie.

6815109,4,B00PK7HXDU,"Israel Horowitz wrote the play, adapted the play for the screen an directed this little drama MY OLD LADY. It works on some levels: after a rather disconcertingly angry beginning it settles into a somewhat sanguine love story. The project is salvages by the contributions of the three lead actors without whose talent this piece may have become a bore.

An American inherits an apartment in Paris that comes with an unexpected resident. That is barebones for the story. A more extended synopsis: `When Mathias Gold (Kevin Kline) arrives at the sumptuous Parisian apartment he inherited from his distant but wealthy and recently deceased father, he's surprised that the property comes with two stubborn live-in tenants who are not required to leave according to an ancient French real estate law - explained amply as the case of the viager. Unable to sell the place, Mathias moves in with the feisty 92 year old Englishwoman, Mathilde Gerard (Dame Maggie Smith), and her middle aged daughter, Chlo (Kristin Scott Thomas). But as Mathias and Chlo draw increasingly closer, Mathilde unveils a complex labyrinth of secrets that unites the trio in unexpected ways. The story draws on the old `kept mistress' theme - Mathias' married father and Mathilda were lovers while Mathilde was married and the passage of ownership of the apartment is at times as confusing as the paternity of both Mathias and Chlo.

The three main actors manage to pull this off and are aided by some fine cameos by Dominique Pinon and Nomie Lvovsky. Sophie Touitou plays the casual opera singer along the Seine (is this her voice or a voice over?) singing Mozart and dueting with Kline in `La ci darem la mano' from `Don Giovanni.' This adds a bit of class to the film.

Once the film decides it is not a n angry comedy but a quasi-serious love story the film becomes far more interesting. Not a great film, but it is always a pleasure seeing Smith, Kline and Thomas in action. Grady Harp, February 15",1423440000,4,1971,4.808259587020649

6815115,4,B00PK7HXDU,"Despite an unfortunate title and ads that peg this as more of a comedy (it's really a drama with touches of comedy), in the end I sort of fell for My Old Lady.  Kevin Kline stars as Matthias, an irascible, bitter American who's used the last of his money on a ticket to Paris, to claim the inheritance of an apartment his estranged father left him in his will.  Upon arrival, he's shocked to learn the apartment was rented as a ""viager"" - common in France, it's a process where the original remains living in the apartment, the new owner paying monthly rent until the first owner dies; then, the apartment is theirs - and is currently inhabited by the 92-year-old Mathilde Girard (Maggie Smith) and her daughter Chloe (Kristin Scott Thomas).  Matthias, who came to Paris to sell the place, instead has to attempt a ""Plan B"" - selling the contract - and in the process comes to learn about both women, long secrets of his past, and whether he can find a happiness in life again.  Very emotionally involving, with a sweet finish.",1423267200,,1027,4.535135135135135

6815117,5,B00PK7HXDU,"A now penniless Mathias Gold (Kevin Kline) comes to Paris to look at his new inheritance but to his surprise, there is someone already living there. An elderly woman snoozing in a chair curled up under blankets with a book resting on her covering, she knows him instantly. She is sweet and kind but certainly no fool. Her name is Matilde Gerard (Maggie Smith), a quite spry ninety-year-old (that is what she says) woman  who barters English lessons for a number of different necessary services, including her own healthcare. While Mathias prefers to go by Jim, she still calls him his given name. Apparently, she comes along with the building and is 'Mrs. G' to him. As she and he survey the property together, she begins telling him how she knows him through his father. This is where he learns about ""The Situation"", a French system which allows her to remain there until her death. A former English teacher who cannot stop correcting people's vocabulary including Mathias' as they move around.

Mrs. G. tells Mathias that she is the one, and not him, that is to collect the fees from the people living there and Mathias has ""collected a large debt"" from the apartment instead. Ah, ""Spare me the Fromage"", He begins to learn the ways of the French, the people, and the culture which is so different than American. When talking about their ages, he tells her that he is 57 and 11 months while she retorts, ""How do you get to be 57 and 11 months and have nothing to show for it?"" This brings out the tale of Mathias, Mrs. G. and his coldhearted and neglectful father. Throw in Chloe later and you have a stacked deck. He has had a horrible upbringing and throughout the movie tells the story of a man Mrs. G. thought she knew so well, but how well? ""It's the 64 Euro question!"" - If he knows the truth of his father, then how can she think the exact opposite? The conversations between Smith and Kline are a tour de force of wit, sarcasm, sadness and misinformation on both sides.

Chloe (Kristen Scott Thomas) discovers Mathias quite by accident as she resides in their apartment and she is Mrs. G's daughter also going through her own struggles. These two do not get on very well at all and she wishes to petition for his removal. Her life intersects and later becomes integral to his story throughout this circumstance and she and Mathias wind up pitching targeted barbs toward each other at first. I loved the sarcasm in the interactions between all three of these apartment dwellers as they each square off in atmospheric Paris, France. Mathias tries every way to get Mrs. G. to leave, but then she recounts his past with his father as she believed it was, or was it? Mathias explains it very differently, full of pain, agony, and horrifying dysfunction. ""I feel you're an old French fibber, Mrs. G"" as she holds up the memory of his father. Mathias begins to write about his lifetime being cursed by his parents and their lack of approval. He still tries to detach from their influence in his life at 57 years and 11 months.

This movie is shown so beautifully in the streets of Paris (Michel Amathieu). The whitewashed brick houses and gorgeously lined cobblestone pathways with their greenery and hamlets. A lovely scene of a woman singing opera as Mathias joins in while sauntering by and viewing the lovely water dancing in the background. The music is strolling Parisian and certainly flavors the situations (Mark Orton). It has you right in the palm of its hand while feeling its nostalgia and wanderlust. There are times when your feet do not touch the ground then times when your heels dig right in dancing from note to note. Written and directed by Israel Horovitz, from his play of the same name, ""My Old Lady"", never lets you forget the difference in cultures, in the dialog, and in the mannerisms of the French people. Poor Mathias is broke, down to his last dime while learning of this 'Situation' sending him into an acerbic tailspin - more than once; bottles of wine, wine, and more wine. The movie refuses to sink into the Seine as Kline's trademarked razor-sharp wit sizzles and Smith's from the heart counterbalance pulls this above the surface holding it fast. ""Vive la French People"", a frustrated Mathias launches a facetious jab at Chloe, ""Vive la French People"" ...",1423180800,51,4294,4.653491436100132

6815130,5,B00PK7HXDU,"I love this movie. I wanted to see this since before and after it was released in selected cities. The acting is spectacular. Long before I had it, I originally wanted to figure out how it will be easy when it comes to watching it and playing with my dolls at the same time. I ended it on perfect timing because of how hard the personalized acting looks. Some parts of it were funny. When I heard the rifle shoot towards the end of the movie, I thought Mathias gave up his own life or injured himself. But no. ""I shot the pig."" he said and I laughed and said ""Thank God."" Kevin (Kline) has been playing 50-year-old men recently when in reality he was in his late 60's. (Will be 68 in October.) When it's 30 minutes left of the movie, I kept on saying as an alternative to saying ""I love you"", 'You are my one and only teddy bear.' He's like a teddy bear because when I first met him, he was nice towards my mum and I. At one part of the movie, he was seen in bed sitting up in bed with his head against the headboard and a pillow behind his neck. He had his left massive huge hand against his face fingers curled up as if he was biting the nails and I sarcastically asked ""Are you biting your nails?"" and then I laughed because I've never seen him do that before in person or on screen. I admired Dame Maggie since the Harry Potter franchise. After the franchise was over, I got to see more of her other than when she played Mervina Mcgonagall. Kristin Scott Thomas I admire her from watching bits of Life as a House (which now I'm able to access into watching it.) At first Chloe wanted Mathias out of their apartment but later on, they asked him to stay.  I used to have a problem with seeing Kevin drink something on screen or in person because it's like doing cheers constantly. Then it wasn't till this movie that I finally had to stop. My parents, sister of 10 months and everyone in my family should see this.",1422403200,,1916,4.178378378378379
6815131,4,B00PK7HXDU,"In the first third of this film, I thought, oh no, this is going to turn into one trite scene after another. However, I was so wrong, and it turned into a much better film than I thought. Kevin Kline plays Mathias, a son come to Paris to find his inheritance. What he finds is quite a situation.

Dame Maggie Smith plays the 92 year old grande dame of the apartment that belongs to Mathias. Her daughter, Kristin Scott Thomas, plays her daughter. Mother, daughter dislike Mathias at first for a reason, and he is confused through most of the film. I found Kevin Line's acting like an alcoholic a little over the top. Drinking wine from the bottle did not seem natural to him in this film. Dame Smith always the trouper, and superb actress, always on, and ready for action. She looked her age, but don't we all. The title of the film is a little off, unless you think of both Kline and Thomas referring to their mothers. Neither, I think would refer to their mothers as old ladies.

A film that opens up many secrets and old wounds, well done.

6815134,5,B00PK7HXDU,"I have been getting sick of films that said nothing, meant nothing, pretended people were happier, prettier, stronger, smarter than they are; and this is NOT one of those films. It is real.

Real, but hopeful. Real, but redeeming to the spirit, exciting in possibilities, darkly funny.

The acting, photography and story were filmed, and written in such a way as to feel thorough enough so you don't feel cheated with skips in the train of though, or made to finish the story yourself in your head.

Kevin Kline plays a 57 year old man (without a bunch of lying makeup to make him better than what a normal person would be), who after 3 failed marriages, has nothing and no one. His father, who was very wealthy, died and left him nothing except for an apartment in Paris. So he uses the last of his money to go there.

He finds that what he thought was his property outright, is not. The property was sold to his father  as a ""viager"" agreement. This  is basically a reverse annuity mortgage or Remainder Trust. Where A buys the property, and agrees to allow B to continue to live in the property for as long as they live, AND for as long as they live will also pay them an agreed amount of money, either in a lump sum or in payments.

This is the ""Old Lady.""  But the story is NOT about the old lady. It is an EXAMINATION of what can happen to families when one of the parents cheat. It is about the pain this causes, the devastation it takes on the lives of the victims of the adulterers.  And if the story ended just there, this story would be OK but a downer, and not worth watching for me.

There is always a place for people that point out what is wrong in life; but then what?  Just saying what is wrong is like complaining, just the beginning of the process. That is depressing if it is just complaining. It drains you. BUT for those that give you an idea of how to fix what is broken, how to move past what is wrong to making it right; now THAT is what most of our souls crave. And what this story helps us do.

There is the damage, the exploration of the damage, the moving past of the tunnel vision on solely the self so that the world starts to come in view again, and then there is hope of life...again.  THIS is this film.

In psychology, often you can not speak directly TO people about what they are doing wrong, or what they are feeling in their lives...it is too threatening to them and they will close you out. So therapists often use films. In films you can see what is happening, without getting defensive and blocking the realization.

So this film might help cheaters, understand the pain they cause their wives and children. The children of parents absorbed in their nightmares so that they emotionally abandon the child. The cheated on spouse who thinks they are being brave for their children. IT could help in many combinations there.

The photography, seems a little drab and dark at first. (I often enjoy seeing beautiful places and hope for this when I am watching a movie that is in an exotic place) BUT it is right. It makes you focus on the story, the acting, the people. Which you would not want to miss, like ""Today is a shadow of tomorrow"" and "" A flower when it is at it's most beautiful, is right before it becomes old"".

The acting of Kline sometimes seems a little awkward, but this may have been done purposefully as his is an awkward, out of sinc kind of person. AND as in most of what he does, is superb. I don't remembered names, but the other actors, ALL of them right to the bit parts, are extremely well done.

BUT on top of it all, it is a well made, thoughtful film that is entertaining, that you don't feel like you have wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of your life. A film that leaves you feeling a little emotionally washed and energized to start again with hope.

This film is a gem, a pearl. Savor it when you have the time to really sink in.",1421452800,204,3894,4.2806539509536785

8688354,5,B00PK7HXDU,"A delightful, painful comedy featuring a stellar cast: Kevin Kline as troubled Mathias Jim Gold, more sinned against than sinning; radiant Kristine Scott Thomas, as Chloe Girard; and Maggie Smith as her unpredictable mother (Mathilde Girard).  Smith is the source of their misery, the result of several questionable liaisons, one with Klines father. Complicating the issue is Mathilde, who is blessedly blind to the effect her affairs have had on Jim and Chloe. Their stories gradually unfold over the course of the movie.  Muddying up the waters even more is a sumptuous Parisian apartment, which Kline has inherited and wants to sell, as hes broke and counting on the Parisian property to get him out of hock, and to allow him to travel, the sale of which will put Chloe and her mother out on the street.  Funny, cruel and full of surprises coupled with an intelligent script and superb acting, particularly by Mr. Kline and Ms Smith.  One thing leads to another and Kline decides not to sell much to Chloe's relief.  Chloe and Jim hook up, and the movies ends on an upbeat note.  The sign of good movie is that it holds up after repeated playing which, My Old Lady does.  I've seen it many times and learn something new with each viewing.
