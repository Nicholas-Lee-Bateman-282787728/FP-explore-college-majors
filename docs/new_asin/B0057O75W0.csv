8461060,5,B0057O75W0,This dvd has been a tremendous help in reducing shoulder pain and stiffness related to my PD.  My arms are gaining strength. It first appeared to be too simple but it really stretches and works everything from the neck to the ankles.  It is not just a few simple chair exercies.  Some exercises are seated and some are standing.  I look forward to the workout every day.  I can really tell a difference when I don't do it.  I highly recommend this dvd.,1469318400,,452,4.385542168674699

He was skeptical at first but mom and dad followed along together. Much to my pleasure, he exercises now twice a day based on learnings from the DVD.",1436400000,,197,4.5
8461062,3,B0057O75W0,"I was expecting a much better video.  Not a lot was explained as could have been about why an exercise was being done and adjustments that could be made if it was too difficult for a viewer.  The exercises themselves were fine.  The presenter was dry.  Also, my dad's Parkinson's was more advanced than anyone that was shown on the video.  He is mobile without a cane but unable to do most if not all of the exercises.  I figured he was moving and attempting to do them so that was exercise in itself.  Not a purchase I had hoped it would be.",1433980800,,542,4.203883495145631
