4642811,5,B005B0QYMW,"My daughter has been a huge fan of Mo Willems for a while now and seeing these characters come to life made her laugh out loud!  Her favorite is the Pigeon, especially when he interacts with the little Duckling.  In any case, the only problem with these DVDs is that we wish that they lasted longer (that's what my daughter said) but she will watch them over and over again!  Very well done and a nice compliment to reading the books!",1346630400,12,434,4.333333333333333

4642813,5,B005B0QYMW,"My niece and nephews loved the pigeon books before, both written and audio but to watch them on DVD had us laughing out loud. We were also introduced to some of his other characters they will be soon added to our bookshelf.  It was nice to hear how the author himself with help from his daughter read the books",1475193600,,310,4.254237288135593

4642816,4,B005B0QYMW,"My boys aged 3 and 5 love  are the pigeon.  We all do.  I ordered these videos and they are great.  My boys especially love ""Don't let the pigeon drive the bus,"" and ""THe pigeon finds a hotdog.""  They do lose a bit of interest in the one in Spanish and the one that features Mo Willems visiting a school.  If they had more straight pigeon cartoons, they would be incredibly interesting and entertaining.",1455494400,3,403,4.378378378378378

4642826,5,B005B0QYMW,"Mo Willems's books are engaging and entertaining. As a school librarian, I found that they were among my primary grade students' favorites. I was so pleased when I saw that several of them have been made into a DVD format. I purchased these DVDs for home use and my grandchildren love them. From a teacher's point of view though, they are also a wonderful teaching aid. They can be viewed with or without closed captioning so students have the option to ""read along"". They also include discussion questions and a presentation by Mo Willems that shows what happens at one of his school author visits. He encourages children to read, draw his characters, and write their own stories about those characters. I encourage parents, grandparents and teachers to add these DVDs to their collections.",1409184000,,791,4.91044776119403
4642827,5,B005B0QYMW,"I bought this DVD because it was a great price and because my first grade class became obsessed with Mo Willems books! I got them this DVD as a surprise and they loved every story. It's super cute as Mo himself voices some of the characters and so does his adorable daughter, Trixie. Get his books and then get this DVD. Your kids will be delighted!

P.S. The pigeon did not write this review.",1406505600,10,393,4.3108108108108105

4642831,5,B005B0QYMW,Mo Willems is my favorite. This is all the stories on DVD that he has out together in one set. Well worth the money. I ordered it online because it is difficult to find in stores and more expensive. Totally worth the purchase.,1404691200,,226,4.27906976744186
4642832,5,B005B0QYMW,I love Mo Willems! His books are great for children. I will use these videos in my Kindergarten classroom every year.,1403740800,,117,4.619047619047619

4642835,5,B005B0QYMW,"We're really picky what we let our kids watch. The stories are straight forward, relatable and sweet. The artistic quality of the images are great. I don't mind being around when they're on, unlike most kid's videos that are so annoying. It's a keeper.",1400803200,,252,4.75
4642836,4,B005B0QYMW,"These videos are just like the books. My 2 & 4 year old boys love them. You can turn storytelling (basically captions) on or off. The animation is good, better than expected. I wasn't sure if the characters would move and talk and have different voices or if it would just be well narrated. They are very cute and well done. I wish there were more stories, like Elephant and Piggie.",1398038400,,382,4.394366197183099
4642837,5,B005B0QYMW,My boys absolutely love the Pigeon and Duckling books by Mo Willems so when I saw this dvd set I knew I had to get it.

Definitely recommend!,1393804800,,305,4.224137931034483
4642838,3,B005B0QYMW,"So the cartoon form sold here is okay, just not nearly as much fun as the original books; there's nothing like a book to employ quality time with a child.",1391817600,,154,4.166666666666667

4642849,3,B005B0QYMW,"my son thought it was cute and it was ok but it has no real ""replay"" value; i recommend buying it used. your kids will only watch it once and the ""extras"" on the disc are just a spanish translation and a karaoke sing-along",1364947200,,222,4.068181818181818
4642850,1,B005B0QYMW,"While I know it was my responsibility to return the DVD, time got away from me and I guess I missed the ""deadline"" to return damaged goods.  One was fine (and the kids watched and watched, prob why I missed the deadline to return), second DVD was unwatchable and we LOVE Mo Williems.  Not sure I will order DVD's from Amazon as this is NOT the first time we have had issues.",1364947200,,374,4.180555555555555

4642855,2,B005B0QYMW,"Just like the other Scholastic DVD's that we have (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, Chicka Chicka 123), this one has quality and/or editing problems. No visible scratches on DVD - it's brand new! - but the picture locks up frequently, and the words sometimes get stuck on one part of the story while the audio/picture move on to something else. Some parts have horizontal lines over the pictures. It's really frustrating to sit there and wait for the DVD player to move past the ""error"" and continue.

That said, my daughter loves almost all of Mo Willem's creations, and was very excited to get these DVD's for Christmas. Cute ""extras"" at the beginning of the stories, as well as a nice little assortment of additional features. Since no one else mentioned problems, I'll try returning it and ordering a new one - and crossing my fingers that I just have a defective DVD this time.",1356393600,2,874,4.675324675324675

4642857,5,B005B0QYMW,"The kids love it. I wish they had more on one DVD.
It's the story book in movie form with the interactiveness included.
Very Cute. It even has me laughing, and I'm 24.

4642860,4,B005B0QYMW,"If your son or daughter loves the pigeon or knuffle bunny as much as my little boy then this DVD is perfect for them.

Well worth your time and money.",1352419200,,378,4.712121212121212
