8719629,3,B00Z96KEG0,"This tells the story of a 1960's dare devil who aspires to do things one way, his way. It chronicles his life as he concludes he wants to set a record for the highest free fall sky dive. Another guy has an unofficial record.

He has a list of what seem like impossible things to accomplish/get to make his dream a reality. When he is finally able to convince a member of Congress that his attempt could be a way to outdo the Cold War Russians he finally gets the help he needs to accomplish his goals.

This follows him and his family in his efforts. Occasional insight. Had never heard of this. Includes a modern day guy who did accomplish the goal.",1468281600,,650,4.276422764227642
