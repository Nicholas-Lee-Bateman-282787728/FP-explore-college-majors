8505015,3,B006VIG1RQ,"Predicatable and pedestrian characters and plot but worth watching for the scenery and the two primary actors.  Try watching with the sound off and set up a period-specific playlist, including bands from NY and the UK.",1454803200,,218,5.055555555555555
8505016,5,B006VIG1RQ,I really loved this. It is a great telling of how two people that didn't really stand a chance were able to change the world of fashion!,1406851200,,136,4.074074074074074
8505017,4,B006VIG1RQ,"I liked this better than I thought I would.  The reason is that the main character is the photographer based on real life UK photographer David Bailey. I hadn't known about the battles he had to do with VOGUE over the stodginess inherent in fashion photography in the early 60s. He was a visionary and ultimately it was his his vision which took hold.  It is also about his then girlfriend and model Jean Shrimpton but hers is a lesser role.  Bailey has terrific fights with the UK executive sent by UK Vogue with him.  They were perfect polar opposites of the soon to be broken class system.  She came from higher up whereas he did not. He told her she couldn't see the trees for the forest and her day was over.  He was right. The photographer in the film BLOW UP was based on him. The actor playing Bailey was terrific.

But the main character a photographer with new ideas was in short a selfish jerk. I couldn't stop watching it but I don't plan to ever watch it again either.",1395360000,2,273,4.48
