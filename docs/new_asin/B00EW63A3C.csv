5948906,5,B00EW63A3C,"World war 2 docudrama shot in black and white (square picture) so that actual bomb test footage can be used in the film. Picture and sound were clear and sharp. First half of the film covers Dr. Barnes Wallace, the brilliant engineer who designed the bouncing bombs as well as the grand slam earthquake bombs used by the British.  The second half of the film covers how Wing Commander Guy Gibson organized a new wing and carried out the Dam Busting raids in Germany.  The unfortunate part of the film is the fact that Commander Gibson named is Black dog the N-word.  The word is used several times during the film in reference to the dog and as a code word for the breaching of one of the dams. If you can get passed that and still enjoy the film you will see a true piece of history carried out by brave flight crews against the longest of odds.  You will also see and hear actual Lancaster and wellington  bombers in flight.  They could have edited out all references to the dog but they left the film intact.  I'm glad they did.",1501286400,2,1031,4.338541666666667

5948911,4,B00EW63A3C,This is a good movie for anyone interested in WWII. It is a story based on actual events leading to the destruction of Germany's Ruhr Dams. A special bomb that would skip over the water and come to rest against the dam walls had to be developed to do the job. They called them bouncing bombs.,1497657600,2,292,4.232142857142857
5948912,4,B00EW63A3C,"This is a British movie made in 1954. It was intentionally filmed in B&W to integrate actual footage
from 1942 when this event took place. Very well done, and the story is intriguing. If they ever
put out a remastered version that will play in the USA the movie will be worth 5 stars!",1497312000,2,284,4.277777777777778
5948913,4,B00EW63A3C,"including the true intricacy of how many things needed to work in concert, from an obsessed theorist to the men who actually had to deliver the bomb with great precision to the right place at the right time.  It is fun, then tension builds slowly and the end is very exciting even if we know the outcome.  It is supposed to be a true story.",1493856000,,340,4.2153846153846155

5948931,5,B00EW63A3C,"In 1942, a mostly self-educated engineer named Barnes Wallis came up with an extraordinary idea for smashing some of Germanys most important hydroelectric dams along the Ruhr River.  Impervious to any explosive ordinance that existed at the time, Wallis believed that the dams could be breached by a bouncing bomb that would skip across the surface of the reservoir, stopping just short of the dam wall, sink to the correct depth and explode, with the water serving to intensify the force of the blast.  Once the idea was approved, only about nine weeks were available for the theory to be refined, the bombs designed, tested and fabricated, the aircraft modified and twenty crews trained to fly at tree top level, at night, through enemy occupied territory and drop bombs with pinpoint accuracy.  Amazingly, they succeeded.

This much loved film does an excellent job of summarising the main events of this remarkable story, especially considering that in 1954, when it was made, most of the details of Operation Chastise, as it was formally known, were still classified.

The film incorporates genuine footage of some of the preliminary testing with a little scrubbing by the censors.  Curiously, they missed one important bit and there is one sequence where the backwash produced by the spinning bomb (back spun to produce lift through the Magnus effect) is visible.  That was one of the most highly classified aspects of the project.

With a great story, good acting and excellent photography, this film is a treasure.",1478044800,4,1522,5.06
5948932,5,B00EW63A3C,"This excellent movie has been a favorite of mine since it first came out - saw it as a kid.
The only issue I have is that these later editions edited out part of the theater scene. Still a favorite!",1472601600,2,198,3.975

5948944,4,B00EW63A3C,"Great movie.  I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone who likes science and aviation.  I just want you to expect one thing that disturbed me a little.  One of the RAF officers has a black dog named by a racial epithet which might have been more acceptable 50 years ago than it is today.  If that doesn't bother you, then this movie is perfect.",1456012800,3,354,4.2388059701492535

8610016,5,B00EW63A3C,I just love this bit of history.  there's actualy quite a bit to the real story and they relay it in a feature film very well.  very interesting and entertaining.,1523318400,,162,4.366666666666666
8610017,5,B00EW63A3C,I Love true stories. This is a very good window into the past in WWII where men used their intellect to solve hard problems and the young men who sacrificed their lives to destroy the Nazi war machine. Though some modern arm chair historians downplay this obvious success. It was a huge morale booster for the British and a signal to us Yanks that the British could truly offer resistance to the German on slot. This event did a lot in convincing the USA to entering the War. In a five star rating this is a seven for a history buff.,1520899200,,533,4.287128712871287
8610018,5,B00EW63A3C,A good movie.  I watched it twice and will watch it again.  I do really like these older BW WW2 movies.,1518739200,,103,3.857142857142857

8610021,4,B00EW63A3C,"I loved the movie. But be warned, this movie was made, I believe in England in the early 50""s and is unedited. At that time they were not as sensitive to certain names and titles. So just keep that in mind when you watch it. Over all I liked it very much. And you got to love those old time special affects.",1513209600,,307,3.967741935483871
