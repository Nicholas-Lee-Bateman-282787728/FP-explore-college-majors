8435024,4,B004LWL0OS,"In the months coming up to this event this card continued to become bigger and bigger with one big name fighter after the other, which as a fan, was definitely appealing.  Although big names don't always equal great cards unfortunately.  Thankfully this wasn't the case, as this card definitely left a few great matches and memories for the people.

Miguel Torres opens the main card against Antonio Banuelos.  If you know Torres, used to be one of the best pound-for-pound fighters until a little roadblock known as Brian Bowles (another story for another time), he usually puts on a pretty exciting fight but unfortunately Banuelos struggled with the height and reach difference which would result in a rather uneventful bout that would go the distance.

For some reason all I can remember about the Jake Ellenberger/Carlos Eduardo Rocha fight was that it was really uneventful.  It was close but not in the way that was exciting.  Fight ends with a split decision victory.

Jon Jones taking on Ryan Bader was a very interesting fight for two reasons: both were strong contenders to enter the title mix with the next fight and the other reason being that if it weren't for a disqualification loss on Jones' record both fighters would be undefeated coming into this fight.  I've liked Bader since his run in the Ultimate Fighter and Jones has been such an exciting prospect since his debut that this fight definitely had the makings of a great fight.  Unfortunately for one fighter the other looked just plain dominate, and I mean scary dominate.  The second round submission probably isn't remembered so much as the post-fight interview, which sent waves through the MMA world.

I'm a fan of both Forrest Griffin and Rich Franklin, and when you put together two exciting former champs together you expect fireworks, right?  Although not quite the barn-burner I expected it was a decent fight, although it admittedly was hurt by the expectations I had.

The main event between Anderson Silva had been postponed for over a year.  Initially this fight was supposed to happen on Jan. 2nd of 2010 but with injuries to both fighters it was cancelled not once but twice.  So frustrating because I'm a big Belfort fan and was looking forward to the Phenom battling it out with the Spider in what would be a fan's dream striker match.  Then it finally happened, the big fight with the crowd at a fever pitch and both fighters ready to go.  There was an initial feeling out period (common to Silva fights) but when these two let loose it had me on the edge of my sight and as in any strikers fight the finish came out of nowhere.  Chances are if you're a fan of MMA you already know the victor based on the incredible finish but it's one you need to see to believe.  I would absolutely love to see a rematch between these two.

Pretty good UFC event.  Not the greatest main card but it definitely was filled with some interesting moments.  Strangely enough, beyond the main event, I'd have to say it's the under card that really saves this event.",1315872000,,3038,4.70132325141777
