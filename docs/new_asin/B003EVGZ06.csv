8395700,5,B003EVGZ06,"Wonderful DVD of a live show that I had the good fortune to see when he came to Raleigh, NC.  If you have never seen him perform live, you are in for a real treat.  A super tight band and his backup singers include Aiesha Morris, his daughter and the subject of ""Isn't She Lovely.""  She does a very good solo.

If you are a fan of his, it should be in your library.",1287014400,,365,3.891891891891892
