8322977,5,B001N2WJ2Q,"A wonderful piece of my childhood recaptured. Watching this anime sure is different compared to when i first saw it 17 years ago but hey, NOSTALGIA all the same.",1448928000,,161,4.586206896551724

8322980,3,B001N2WJ2Q,"The only issue I have with this release is that the original ""complete collection"" was released in a thinpak. This time around you have the same 5 discs but they come in a clam shell box all stacked on one spindle with nothing between the DVDs (Like the old computer game CDs used to come packaged in).  Other than that they seem the same as the original complete collection.",1256774400,,375,4.434782608695652
8322981,4,B001N2WJ2Q,"This is a strange series to watch all the way through.

It has an all-star production team, such as the character designer from Saber Marionette and music producer from Utena. Even the opening, ending, and insert songs are by famous singers. The back story is complex, and you would even sympathize with the ""enemies"" by the end.

So what went wrong? First, the show seems to be constantly searching for an audience. Almost every demographic under 30 seems to be targeted by the show at one time or another. Second, the pacing is extremely erratic. A lot of episodes are spent not progressing much, while all the story is packed into a few episodes. Lastly, the DVD mastering is really bad. This is a 1998 TV show, so there should not be lines, snow, and flickers like an 70s reel.

Overall, it is still an above average show. The story is original, the characters are well developed, and the music is great. Just try to not let the ""intended audience"" switching throw you off. Plus, the complete set for the price of less than two volumes is a steal.",1169942400,10,1051,4.550264550264551
