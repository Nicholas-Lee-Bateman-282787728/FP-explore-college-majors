8213166,3,B000UFJO02,"I didn't pay much for this DVD. I bought it because of the Beautiful Grace Kelly. The performances are great plus there is bonus footage of Grace getting married plus the birth of one of their children. The bonus footage is better quality than the feature. It is a much copied kinescope, very blurry etc. I hope there is a better quality DVD of this somewhere. Only buy this if You are a die-hard Grace Kelly fan, otherwise leave it at the store!",1381017600,,446,4.385542168674699
8213167,3,B000UFJO02,"A good well acted story but the video quality is poor.  The plot is a bit contrived but they only had an hour.  Made for television from the book ""The Hills have no Shadows"" it appears to be recorded in ""kinescope"" but certainly the darks are very dark and the brights are very bright.  A plus is the scene with Grace acting tough with a rifle.

The newsreel footage of the wedding and the early days of baby Caroline are fun.",1227830400,2,426,4.222222222222222
