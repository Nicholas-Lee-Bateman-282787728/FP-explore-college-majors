I recall seeing a trailer but not mustering the interest to watch the movie. I finally succumbed due to a dearth of good movies for that age group, and my kids LOVED it! I was reading an alphabet book on bugs at that time and they were super happy to see some of these bugs. I highly recommend this movie for 3-4 year olds.",1503014400,,556,4.304761904761905

1012064,1,6305326940,"I like this movie fine for the story line and characters and whatnot (I think I watched it in the movie theaters way back in the day when I didn't have kids yet). We have passes to Disneyland/ Disney's California Adventure which has A Bugs Life Land, so we thought we should get it to provide some context for him. My 3 year old son finds it entertaining enough to request it when he sees it in our Prime video library too, but apparently, one of the characters says the word ""stupid"" -- which seems innocuous enough until your toddler uses the word over and over again after watching the movie. He said one of the ""mean grasshoppers"" says it. It's not cursing, I know, but he goes to a conservative daycare and I'm concerned he might be using that around his teachers and classmates too. It's getting old having to explain to him that it's not a nice word to call people. We don't shelter him from real, everyday language but he only seems to launch into the ""do you think I'm stupid"" bit after watching this movie. He blames it on the grasshoppers, so I'm blaming it on them too if anyone at his school gives me a weird, disapproving look. I'd give it a solid 3 stars if it weren't for the ""bad"" language it seems to have imparted on my toddler. If he were maybe one or two years older, I wouldn't care so much, but since it makes me look like a bad mommy, I need to ""shelve"" this until he's a little bigger and learns when it is appropriate to call someone ""stupid."" You know, like when someone REALLY deserves it.",1487894400,4,1517,4.289198606271777

At first she was hesitant until the bugs did something funny (which they all do) and now she isn't afraid of bugs and looking for them *all* the time and when she sees one, she'll say what she thinks it is from the movie then start watching it. She's 2 1/2 yrs old so this is a good time to learn about all things in life.
Now both my Granddaughter and Daughter in Law are seeing ""bugs"" in a different way which is a good thing, didn't see that coming!",1485216000,5,644,4.0390625

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

1014143,5,6305326940,"""A Bug's Life"" is without a doubt my all time favorite Pixar film. The plot is about an ant who enlists circus bugs thinking they're warriors to help liberate his colony from a terrorizing group of grasshoppers. This movie is full of action, comedy, and suspense. Like any Pixar movie a heavy celebrity cast including Dave Foley (Kids in the Hall, Dan vs.), Julia Louis Dreyfus (Seinfeld), Kevin Spacey (The Ref), Denis Leary (The Ref, Ice Age) and Phyllis Diller.

Now onto the release review. ""A Bug's Life"" is presented in both its original theatrical ratio of 2.39:1 and a special reframed version for Fullscreen televisions. This set is loaded it shows foley sound effects featurettes, a behind the scenes segment of how Pixar reframed the film for VHS and TV airings. And much much more.

Highly Recommend It! :)",1449100800,,818,4.835714285714285

1015518,1,6305326940,"Amazon streaming seems to have an issue with streaming video.  We've streamed 2 movies so far and both have had issues with the sound cutting out and then with degraded picture resolution.  The first time we tried it was a couple weeks ago and the movie was free so we just turned it off.  A Bug's LIfe was not free so that was unfortunate.  And just to clarify, we stream movies regularly with Netflix and HBO so it isn't an internet or technical issue, just seems to be a reoccurring problem with Amazon streaming.  Also, my rating has nothing to do with the movie itself, but rather the service.  When Amazon didn't work, we watched it through FIOS and it was great.

Absolutely stunning animation, excellent, timeless script, clever enough to keep both parents and kids entertained and amused, and terrific voice talent! This was made back when Pixar was young and had a visionary Steve Jobs calling the shots, and his belief in putting the best into a product, to assure its staying power, rather than cranking out the latest cliche' to make a quick buck, really shows!!!

1016455,5,6305326940,"Sheer perfection, this is my favorite Pixar film.  It's probably one of their more elegant looking films due to the splendid use of widescreen and by bringing the landscape down to an ant's POV.  (In the credits, it's claimed that a bug's life was ""filmed entirely on location."").  The story is a sly adaptation of Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper.  Most of the voice actors came from television and as such were quite familiar.  There's no shortage of humor and excitement.  And there's a fabulous life lesson on what to do with bullies......feed them............to something else.",1420934400,,591,4.979591836734694

Trust me, for a three year-old, they do.  I learned that when I played the movie for my grandson last month.  He is generally an exceptionally tough little guy, but within 5 minutes or so of the start of this movie he was huddled in a corner of the couch sucking his thumb for dear life.  We stopped the movie, put in ""Turbo"", and life was again grand.

We'll show him this movie again in, maybe, three years or so.",1409184000,,555,4.188679245283019

1017426,5,6305326940,"A Bug's Life is Pixar's second attempt at a full length CGI feature film and it is easy to see this film in terms of visual quality is a huge improvement over the first Toy Story film. Having just finished watching all 53 Disney theatrical released animated films, I'm impressed with the track record they had over the course of almost 80 years. When you consider that between Disney and Pixar releasing The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beat, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2 all in decade or so, the quality of these films is nothing short of amazing in terms of animation, story, music and characters.

The Blu Ray looks and sounds amazing and this time it appears that they didn't leave anything out from the previous 2 disc DVD edition(YAY!). Even if some of the bonuses are in SD it is still an excellent upgrade. If you're looking to own a Bug's Life, look no further because this is a demo quality release to Blu Ray!",1396137600,,957,4.4375

1017684,5,6305326940,"This was PIXAR's second movie after 'Toy Story'.

Loosely based on Seven Samurai and inspired by the Silly Symphony The Grasshopper and the Ants, A Bug's Life chronicles an ant colony besieged by grasshoppers who steal thier food. Flik, the hero, goes on a quest to find warrior bugs to help the colony. He finds a troupe of circus bugs that he mistakes for warriors.

The animation is much improved over Toy Story, owing to the advancement of CGI technology. The movements are much more fluid and natural looking. The lighting and shading effects are also more advanced than the technology available when PIXAR made Toy Story. This gives an inkling of what is to come from PIXAR. This was cutting edge when A Bug's Life was made. The technology may be a bit dated, but the fun is not. A Bug's Life is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and is always a pleasure to watch.

The Blu-Ray transfer, as with other Disney Blu-Rays, is exemplary! Everything is in clear focus and very sharply defined. The level of detail is amazing. Yet another flawless HD transfer from Disney.

There are some nice extras on the making of A Bug's Life, including some research footage of real bugs. It also has two great animted shorts. One is 'Geri's Game' about an old coot playing a game of chess against himself (little realizing that his opponent cheats) and the Silly Symphony The Grasshopper and the Ants which inspired the movie.

For a fun movie for the whole family, you can't go wrong with A Bug's Life. The biggest little adventure there is!

After the rescue scene in the middle of the movie it is much more engaging to him.  If the action was as good in the first half as the second half, it would have been 4.5 stars.  (Toy Story and Finding Nemo are so far the only 5 stars for us, since our son is literally glued to the screen from the opening credits and still asks for them after having seen them each at least 50 times). Overall, it's a really cute story, and we've gotten about 3 viewings out of it so far, and probably will get several more, so it was worth it to buy it, as opposed to Cars II or Ice Age:Contintental Drift, both sequels to movies that our son enjoys, but which did not engage our son at all and were a waste of our money unfortunately.",1371945600,4,816,3.9634146341463414

Hopper is one mean-ass muther not to be messed with,he would make a good biker.
Awesome voices heard through out the film very entertaining.
I also thought Geri's Game was cool amazing how they put this together.
And Dot finally flies.
This also has great sound especially with Hopper and his gang.
The outtakes were long and drawn out with credits should have shown outtakes only,and that's it.
Best part is the Alternate Outtakes with the acrobatic slug/twins they belch and they fart,too funny.
I guess even insects have bloated gas at times.
I would highly recommend this movie for all ages it has to be one of the best animation movies ever made.
Clocks in at 95m and Geri's Game at 5m and also has a silent menu to it.

I didn't like any of this either.

Nor did my 4 1/2 year old.  He was petrified.

Now I have to explain to him that it's mean to punch people in the face, threaten them, yell at them, hurt them, or bully those who are smaller or weaker than you.  Thanks Disney for teaching my kid exactly how to be mean.

1018444,5,6305326940,"A Bug's Life is one hour and thirty - four minutes and was released in theaters on November 25, 1998. Basically the main story is that Flik, an ant, leaves the island home of the ant colony to find warrior insects to fight off the grasshoppers who demand food from the ants each spring. What Flik brings back are circus insects and the circus insects think that they have been hired to perform. In the end it all works out for everyone. This would be the last movie for Roddy McDowall and Madeline Kahn. A Bug's Life  is good family movie and gets an AAA+++.

1018482,5,6305326940,"This movie looks fantastic in blu-ray format, the ants sometimes look like toys that you can actually reach in and pick up. The environments look a bit dated by today's CGI standards and I think in this format its easier to tell, but for how old this movie is, it still looks great, so that's nothing big.

Pros: Movie looks fantastic and ants look like toys at times

Cons: Where the heck is A Bug's Life 2!? Seriously I've been wanting a sequel for years! I honestly thought that at the end of Toy Story 2, when they were showing the bloopers and Heimlich (spelling?) the caterpillar made a cameo and mentioned A Bug's Life 2, I thought that was pretty much a confirmation that it was in the works. Oh well, hopefully we see one some day.

1018641,4,6305326940,"""A Bug's Life"" is a great movie from Pixar, with good humor and action, and excellent animation. It's now out on Blu-ray, and looks perfect. The detail and color is first rate. But this movie has so much more than pretty pictures. There's a diverse cast of likable and entertaining characters, great voice actors, solid and funny writing, and exciting action sequences. The Pixar movie it most resembles is probably ""Monsters, Inc."", which also has a lot of humor, action, and fun characters. The Blu-ray disc contains a lot of making of material, a Pixar short, a 1934 Disney cartoon with a lot of singing, and commentary. I don't think ""A Bug's Life"" is quite as good as Pixar's best, such as ""Finding Nemo"", but I think it's close to the top.

1018644,5,6305326940,First time I saw Bugs Life I was 6 years old when this came out. Its about an ant colony that gets bullied by a bunch of big ugly grasshoppers. Flik is always inventing but not many of the ants in the ant colony appreciate Flik except for Dot. Especially after one of his inventions knocks all the food into the water and Hopper and his gang of nasty grasshoppers are non too pleased about it and double the amount of food for themselves. So Flik goes to the city and finally finds bigger bugs who look like warriors but are really circus bugs. Will Flik and everyone be able to stop Hopper and his grasshoppers? Or will they once again be bullied by them? Well you'll have to find out won't you? Its a great movie for every age group weather your a little kid or a teen or an adult.

1018684,5,6305326940,"When people name the Pixar movies, A Bug's Life gets unfairly overlooked all the time. I don't know why because ABL is a great film that further elevates Pixar status as the animation leader nowadays. Being their second feature, is amazing how the Pixar artists didn't repeat themselves and played it safe. No, they took a bold risk and made a completely different movie that turned out great. ABL is an achievement in storytelling with full-fledged characters, engaging story and plot, a spectacular score (second only to Up in my book) and of course breathtaking animation. The colors, the textures, everything is so detailed and crisp and is still impressive even when the film is over 10 years old.

In my opinion, no one should overlook ABL because you'd be missing a great movie (as usual with Pixar) and good quality entertainment for kids and adults.

Video & Audio
ABL is one of the best looking BD out there. Everything is so transluscent, so detailed, so crisp that you'll stare in awe scene after scene. The color of the ants, the leaves, the water, everything is completely clean and immaculate in this transfer. Simply terrific.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA also is bombastic, clear without any distortions. Amazing.

Bonus Features:

The BD of ABL carries over everything from the 2-disc CE DVD which includes an audio-commenatry, the short Geri's Game (in HD), and making of featurettes such as Production, design, animation, story, and more. Also galleries and publicity material is included. New to this BD is a 'Filmmakers Roundtable' where the director, producer and screenwriter reminicence about the making of the film. Easily this is the best piece from the set that no one should miss. Also there is the first draft of the story which has a different main character and some other different story points. This is really interesting to watch. Last, the Silly Symphony 'The Grasshopper and the Ants' is included in HD.

A DVD copy is also included.

CLosing Thoughts:

ABL is one of Pixar's funniest, heart warming movies and of course being a Pixar film, is one of the best animated features out there. There is no reason you should avoid this film because is wonderful. Ther BD boasts terrific video & audio presentation alongside a healthy amount of bonus features old and new that makes the film even more interesting to watch. ABL on BD is very highly recommended!!",1312675200,9,2382,4.878712871287129

1018687,4,6305326940,"This is a good movie, typical good/evil movie for not-so-young kids.  There are some scary scenes with the nasty grasshoppers bullying, and bird/grasshopper attacks, so that will scare younger children (probably <7).  but otherwise, the message is pretty clear.  I do agree with other users the use of language (""you're stupid"", ""I'll kill you"" etc) is not desirable for very young children, especially if they were not exposed to such language (our kids are relatively sheltered from violence and bullying video/TV.  I allowed my 7yr old watch it since he saw it at school already, but probably will prevent the 4yr old from watching it for a little while longer).

So for content, 5-star for older kids, 3-stars for very young kids (it's not like Cars where you can show it to a 3yr old and not worry too much about inappropriate language use).. so average 4 stars.

I do want to comment on this DVD/Blu-ray combination though.  Unlike most of the regualr kid's DVD where they force you to watch all the previews and other advertisements and not allow you to skip them, this Bugs Life DVD starts the movie as soon as you put the disk in the player (well, it does have the FBI warning and the THX short, but that's ok).  I LOVED this.  I just absolutely detest other Disney and children's DVDs that load up front with all the advertisements and previews and I have to keep either fast forwarding or chapter skip each one since it won't let me bypass it all by hitting ""Menu"". I've gotten irritated with many enough that I've ripped and re-burned the DVD on many of my children's favorites so when I insert the DVD in the player it will start playing the movie immediately.  With this Bugs Life DVD, I won't have to do that, so I'm very happy.

I haven't watched the Blu-ray version yet, so I presume all the ads were put in the Blu-ray disk and kept the DVD version free of ads and previews.  I can deal with that, as the kids will be watching the DVD version mostly.",1307145600,6,1968,4.512676056338028
1018763,2,6305326940,"I'm a first time mom and bought this for my toddler.  Beware and prescreen all movies.  This is way too scary for kids under 7-8+.  It was even creepy to me.  I guess older kids may like it.

ok, let me clarify.  7-8+ was probably too high of an age to start watching this movie.  My son was 1-2 years old when we first started watching it and he was scared.  He's a little bit better with it now but is still afraid.  We recently tried to watch Antz too and he was scared of it.  This is why the title of my review was ""not for toddlers""  I think by the age of 4, he could really enjoy this movie without being afraid and telling me to turn it off.",1306022400,,775,4.803030303030303

1018837,5,6305326940,"Pixar is currently the premier animation studio in the world.  It has managed to turn out hit after hit, and after watching ""Bug's Life"" again, I am reminded why.  Of course the animation is fantastic, but the dialog and storyline are even better than that.

I had forgotted the nearly hidden quotes that will go right over children's heads, but that adults will find hillarious.  For example, when a bug at the bar asks for a ""Black Flag"" that was truly funny, but you had to be listening to catch it.  There are lines like that all the way through.

The creative teams at Pixar have done the nearly impossible.  They have managed to turn out nothing but top-notch hits.  Bug's Life was their second movie, and it came out after Toy Story.  It's now hard to imagine that they've come out with 11 animated hits in a row.

The shorts that accompany each movie are also great.  ""Geri's Game"" accompanies this one...you know, the old man who plays chess against himself, and that short won Pixar an Oscar for best animated short.

I could go on and on, but if you haven't watched Bug's Life in a while, you truly owe it to yourself to do that.  And if this title isn't already in your DVD library, why isn't it!?

1018841,5,6305326940,"A Bug's Life has been one of my favorite movies since it came out. My kids and I watched it over and over for years, and oddly the story never got old, and the lines were always funny. The animation is incredibly good, and the character modeling is great considering that the characters are supposed to be creatures who essentially are all identical.

There are many reviews that compare A Bug's Life to Antz. What amazes me is that some people think Antz is the better movie. I don't know how that is possible, except that maybe they are swayed by the bigger names of the voice actors in Antz. (though Phyllis Diller, Roddy McDowell, Kevin Spacey, and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss are not exactly nobody) But even if we give Antz the edge in the voice actors, that's the end of it. A Bug's Life has beautiful animation with incredible attention to detail. In Antz I felt like i was watching something half-baked and unfinished. A Bug's Life is perfectly crafted in every scene. The inventiveness in A Bug's Life is of the first rank. It's hard to imagine how Pixar came up with so many delightful scenes and unusual story twists. I'd mention some, but if there is anyone considering buying this movie for the first time, it's just better if you see them yourself without prior knowledge of what's going to happen. In short, Antz could have been done in puppet theater without losing anything, but A Bug's Life feels like cutting-edge story telling that advances the medium of animation, while showing that computer animation can be beautiful, absorbing, and a memorable virtual experience, yet it never overshadows the brilliant writing; it supports it.

After 11 Pixar animated feature-length movies and even more animated shorts, A Bug's Life still holds its own in the collection of the most innovative animated movies of all time. Pixar shows us again and again why Disney so coveted its output that Disney had to buy Pixar. What's amazing is that even now, with the tremendous advances in Pixar's technological breakthroughs, this movie never feels like it was done with old technology. Its beauty and story are as fresh today as they were 10 years ago. A Bug's Life is an important step along the Pixar trail; not to be missed!",1289347200,,2226,4.749354005167959

He seemed fine during the movie, and even though I was uncomfortable with the language and the bad behavior of the characters I let him watch it.  BIG mistake in parenting on my part.  The grasshoppers were really scary to him and the abrasive language affected him as well.  He fell asleep crying, and only an hour after I tucked him into bed and he already has woken up with a nightmare.  We know a lot of kids his age and a little older who walk around calling people ""stupid""  and saying things like ""I will kill you"", and we always talk with our son about how that behavior is not ok.  To have a disney/pixar movie reinforcing that type of behavior is sickening.  And we wonder why kids these days are becoming less and less respectful, we are training them to be so.

1019058,3,6305326940,"I know there is a generation of kids out there with a special place in their hearts for ""A Bug's Life"".  I know this because I made the mistake of commenting that I thought it was Pixar's weakest film in the presence of the current crop of undergraduate university students.  But I stand by the statement - as one who has only seen the Pixar films as a teenager or older.  This film just doesn't have ""It,"" (whatever ""It"" is).  For an analogy, I turn to the time of the traditional Disney animated hits - ""Lion King,"" in spite of a paint-by-numbers plot, had It.  Pocahontas, although it had gorgeous animation and beautiful songs, didn't.  Similarly, when compared to the ""Toy Stories"" and even ""Cars"", ""A Bug's Life"" just doesn't compare.

Don't get me wrong - there is lots to like about the film, and about this DVD edition.  The voice acting is fantastic, featuring Dave Foley (best know to Canadians from ""Kids in the Hall"", and to Americans from ""News Radio"") as the unappreciated inventor and dreamer Flik.  All Flik wants to do is make a difference, especially in light of his ant colony's oppression by a gang of ruthless locusts headed by Hopper, voiced by a scene-chewing (and always wonderful) Kevin Spacey.  After accidentally destroying the annual tribute to the grasshoppers while demonstrating his latest invention, Flik is sent off on a mission (of his own devising): find some ""big bugs"" to help the colony fight off the grasshoppers.  Instead he finds a set of circus performers who, through a misunderstanding, he brings back to the ant colony to defend it from Hopper's gang.  The circus performers provide some of the best moments, including a pair of demented pill bugs and a German-accented caterpillar.

But.... for whatever reason, the movie never really takes off for me.  Perhaps I was turned off by the variety of insects - it seemed like the filmakers simply threw in whatever came to mind, and it's a mishmash of whatever bugs they thought were fun to draw.  Perhaps it's because the filmakers couldn't bring themselves to go all the way - worker ants are all female, so why is Flik a boy?  The fact that these characters are ants (or bugs in general) is irrelevant.  They could have been rodents, or forest animals, or anything.  Toy Story, Cars, and the Incredibles are brilliant because the stories are driven by the relentless logic of being toys, cars, or retired superheroes.  The bugs in A Bug's Life are just cookie-cutter characters who are manipulated by the plot.

I'm probably being too literal, but what can I say?  Never having seen this as a child, and comparing it to every other Pixar film that I've seen, this one comes up short.  It's still a good movie, and there is lots of good voice acting and some big laughs.  It has a good heart, but unfortunately it is a little dumb.

This 2-disc DVD version has lots of great extras.  John Lassiter's crew made lots of interesting little featurettes while making the film, in which we see the development of the story.  There are interviews with the voice actors, a great audio commentary, and many other extras, including both versions of the end-credits ""outtakes"", probably the most enduring of this film's animated innovations.",1246320000,2,3225,4.755395683453237

So I gave it a chance and I watched this movie on a laptop computer at school for just halfway through then it stopped so I quitted it. This is it, a couple days later, yesterday I bought the 2-disc DVD of this movie and I watched almost all of the thing and began to get scared because there was too much fighting and violence and I started crying for about 5 minutes until I could play a song that could make me feel a lot better.

Of late, we realized, with horror, that our kids' recent aggression, and usage of snide and obnoxious remarks has been due to these ""modern kids classics.""---comments and demands like ""WHERE'S MY FOOD!!!"" (courtesy of ""Bugs Life""); ""YOU'RE STUPID!""; ""YOU IDIOT"" (Toy Story); ""YOU STINK""; shouting ""I'm an ogre!"" after belching...and the like.  Even the brilliant (for adults, that is) Monsters, Inc. and Shrek movies have the characters castigating, berating, ridiculing each other, and teaching some pretty detestable behavior in some places.  Maybe ""Finding Nemo"" is the least objectionable of the bunch.  This movie is the WORST, and is very scary for tots.  The antagonist---the evil Hopper---at various times threatens to kill his own brother and the entire ant colony, humiliates and gloats at various protagonists, and displays other utterly obnoxious and disturbing behavior that is otherwise a very poor influence on toddlers and small children.
In retrospect, all the CLASSIC Disney movies in our collection are safe, tame, and benign by comparison, and far less objectionable if even at all.  (e.g., Cinderella, Snow White, etc).  I wish we'd stuck to safer products for toddlers, like the afore-mentioned Disney titles, or The Wiggles, Baby Einstein, Bob the Builder, etc.  I choose politically correct but safe, over slyly entertaining and wickedly cutting-edge, any day!  Those ""modern classics"" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc----but why give the kids a head-start on learning objectionable phrases and vocabulary that they're going to learn later from others? No one wants their kid to be the FIRST SOURCE of the poor habits and language being adopted by the other kids in the neighborhood and amongst the extended family.
The golden rule now in our house: If the adults enjoy it, and it's not tedious and boring, it's probably inappropriate for kids!",1193270400,37,2050,5.283076923076923

How about a movie that lets kids be kids, instead of this onslaught of cheap sentiments and terror?  The calculated story uses every trick to scare kids.  The limited imagination of the story writers is particularly insulting. Is everything just about good and evil and the fight for survival?  For young kids??  In many ways the film is a throwback to Cold War films such as Red Dawn (1984), in which school kids fought a Soviet invasion (no kidding!).

The writers at Pixar just have a way of taking ideas that many people have had before and doing something with them.  How many people have ever looked at an Ant hill and wondered what those little bugs are thinking?

Well, Pixar took that question and made a very good movie.  The actors are not as well known as the actors in Toy story, but they are great actors, like Kevin Spacey.  And of course John Ratzenberger.  Did you know that he has a voice character in every Pixar film that has been made up to The Incredibles.

the animation is still amazing, and I think I heard that this is the first movie to ever be transferred to DVd from a digital source.

1019410,5,6305326940,"There is something in this film for all ages.

Despite the comments by other reviewers that this movie is too ""dark"", I think it is great children's entertainment.  It is less dark than Snow White (which contains kidnapping, attempted murder, food poisoning, jealousy etc) and just as effective at keeping it light through the use of humour, characterisation and a fast-moving story.  Such films can play a role in introducing children to the difference between good and evil.  If you are concerned about it, use Snow White as your benchmark:  if you'd let them watch Snow White, then Bug's Life would also be OK.

For adults, like most children's classics, there is plenty of meaning beneath the surface of this film.  For example, the basis of the film is a clash of personality and culture.  The hero (Flik) fails to appreciate the negative impact his drive for new ideas has on those who find change difficult.  And they in turn fail to appreciate the unique contribution Flik can make, and reject him as a result.  Ultimately, the film is about the breakdown of their relationship, then the restoration of it, and the transformation of the both the individual and the society so that they can coexist.

Another talking point for adults is the implicit set of values that is promoted through the characters.  For example, in the middle of the film, the hero engages in a massive deception in order to remain accepted by the colony.  This implicitly suggests that lying is OK, providing it is done to keep relationships harmonious - a subject sometimes addressed by more serious plays and films.

This is undoubtedly a great children's film.  But if watched with a discerning eye, there can be a lot in it for adults as well.",1125360000,3,1728,4.771043771043771

1019412,4,6305326940,"This is a fable about our need to believe in ourselves.

The story is probably one of the best features in the exquisite animated film, A Bug's Life. The narrative about the life of a working ant called Flick and his attempt to save his colony from the eternal domination of the grasshoppers -through recruiting a group of insects that turn out to be circus actors- is completely charming, innovative and unique. The plot is a pleasant surprise for the audience: just when one thinks everything is revealed, a new twist comes out to keep us guessing again what will happen.

The movie allows itself to have a series of incredible characters that develop while the story takes its place. Flick goes from naive and optimistic to self-confident and serious. The circus members are one of the most eclectic groups of lovable losers ever to illuminate the screen. They add color to the plot and the rest of the cast, with their adventures, mischief, eccentricities and craziness. Their growth as a group, who finally find their audience, must be highlighted too. Little Princess Dot is charming in her role as a little ant with low self esteem until becomes a leader and finally princess.

The bugs are, in fact, very graceful and funny, but it's through their extravagant personalities and their sharp dialogs that finally conquer our sympathy.

In addition, there's a solid work of animation. The visual splendor is spectacular. This is an engaging film that seems to use the most vibrant colors. The detailed work is admirable in every corner, every gesture. Ambience and characters are not limited to coexist, but to work together, consolidating the story. This is one of the best animated features of the past decade.

Granted it does not have obscene language or graphic violence. It does, however, contain very cruel behavior, lots of ""I'll kill you"" (in one case a character says to his brother something like ""if not for the promise I made to mom on her death bed, I'd kill you right now!""), as well as the mean grasshopper gang (who party in Mexico and are modeled after hell's angels) that is very scary and too dumb to be amusing. In general the themes/ideas presented in this story are far too dark for a kid's movie, with way too much mean-spiritedness and very little to redeem itself. Speaking strictly from the perspective of ""Is it entertaining?"" I'd say that the three of us that watched it (parents and child) were not entertained. One of us adults even fell asleep. By the way, the mean grasshopper gang-leader (named ""Hopper"") gets fed to baby birds in the end, screaming as he's lowered into the open beaks.",1122595200,19,1081,4.5487179487179485
1019414,5,6305326940,"""A Bug's Life"" was actually Pixar's second production (between the two ""Toy Stories""). It was also, at first, the only Pixar movie I didn't like. Having seen it a few more times, though, I can certainly crown it another of their animated gems.

All the regular Pixar honchos (Lasseter, Stanton et al.) were working with animate objects for the first time (toys are inanimate, right?), and they created a crew of...bugs! OK, that doesn't sound very appealing, but it is. Basically, they took the ancient Aesop fable, ""The Ant and the Grasshopper"", and made it into an engaging story about an ant colony and their grasshopper enemies. For comic relief, they added a full-dress flea circus.

  Our hero is Flik, a boyish, geeky ant who's always building wacky inventions that might help the colony during harvest season. They usually flop, too, earning him the enmity of the Queen Ant and her crown princess daughter Atta- but not of Dot, the lovable ""little princess"". After the colony is threatened with a ""harvest-or-else"" mandate from a no-nonsense, mobster-tinged group of grasshoppers, Flik runs off to find the P.T. Flea Circus (headquartered in an animal-cracker box and an egg carton), whose quirky performers- a walking stick, a gypsy moth, and a plump green caterpillar with an oompah-band accent-

are happy to help out. They escape the circus and the ""bug city"" (made of cereal boxes!) to join the ants in a climactic- and funny- battle against the marauding ""hoppers.""

  The voice talent here is as off-beat as the all-bug cast.

Dave Foley, from Canada's ""Kids In The Hall"" comedy group (their CBC shows were a staple on pre-""Sex and the City"" HBO), is very likable as Flik. So is Kevin Spacey, a legit A-list star, who gives Hopper- the leader of the grasshopper mob- a spin that's both deadpan and over-the-top at the same time. Others involved include Julia Louis-Dreyfus (probably her most successful post-""Seinfeld"" gig), an aging Phyllis Diller, and a circus group that includes Denis Leary (a wiseguy ladybug), David Hyde Pierce (a prissy walking stick) and even Madeline Kahn (the Gypsy Moth).

  ""Bug's Life"" was the first Pixar movie to get the extended DVD treatment. Here, you can see how their now-familiar format- ""making-of"" segments, technical work, and side projects like games- came to be. You'll probably be surprised at how the bug sounds were created by Gary Rydstrom, a master sound designer who's done not only every Pixar film through ""Finding Nemo"" but giant hits like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy. The Pixar custom of using gag-line outtakes as the end titles also began here, and two different sequences were used both theatrically and on the DVD. Finally, Randy Newman went with a surprisingly-stirring, Copland-esque score that, strangely, works better than his usual light-hearted sounds.

  A few people with kids I know didn't like ""Bug's Life"" because- well, they hate bugs. I'm not crazy about them, either, but these bugs put on a better show than you think. And since it's all inspired by an Aesop fable, there's a nice little series of lessons about independence and teamwork that all ages can appreciate. Don't let the title scare you- these bugs don't bite (except Hopper)!",1122422400,2,3253,4.9981481481481485

One black sheep ant, Fleck, screws things up though and he is sent on a mission to find some tough bugs to help ward off the grasshoppers when they return ""after the last leaf falls.""  Fleck meets up with a troupe of circus performers, a delightful mix of bug types, and he thinks they are just the warriors to defeat the hoppers (led by a ferociously villainous Kevin Spacey).  The marvelous other voices include Dave Foley, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, Jonathan Harris, Roddy McDowall, Madeleine Kahn and David Hyde Pierce.

1019533,5,6305326940,"Hollywood sometimes has a history of having similar films going head to head for box office glory, whether it was meteors(Deep Impact vs. Armageddon), or volcanos(Dante's Peak vs Volcano). This is another which pitted Antz against this film. Antz came out earlier but it was decidely more adult with Woody Allen's typical humor and some pretty odd stuff(the villain has an almost Hitler-like plot), then this one came out and people actually found this better. And it is by a long shot.

Basically it's like Seven Samurai in the insect world. An ant colony has to gather food for grasshoppers, kind of like the bandits. Flik, an ant no one particularly likes creates an invention that'll cut down production time considerably(if only for a habit of launching the finished stalk on unsuspecting ants). However, he causes an accident where all the food becomes lost so the grasshoppers enter their anthole and double the order of food or bad stuff'll happen.

Flik gets the idea to get bigger warrior-type bugs that'll fend off the grasshoppers(the seven samurai idea). Only instead of vicious bugs he runs into a troupe of circus performers, and pretty lousy ones at that. But he manages to convince his colony that they are strong but they have to fend off the grasshoppers anyway.

This is probably in my opinion the most colorful film Pixar has done. It's so vibrant and rich looking that the colors almost seem to leap off the screen, which is different than the drab looking Antz. Voice talents are quite good too, especially Dave Foley where normally I don't like hyperactive comedians(Robin Williams anyone?) but he fits his character. And I've seen the film many times and I still can't see Kevin Spacey doing the voice, it sounds...different. Guess I've never heard him doing a more menacing voice.

One thing that A Bug's Life had in theatres that's almost a staple with some theatrical releases and especially DVD's is the gag reel or bloopers. This film had bloopers that actually seemed like mistakes or goofs rather than intentionally creating a scene with an obvious goof(like Green Goblin smacking into the bridge in Spider-Man's bloopers).

Pixar had a pretty good record with Toy Story, this, Toy Story 2 and the recent Incredibles(although I can't stand Monsters Inc) and this is just further proof that there's a new animation powerhouse to challenge Disney.",1110499200,,2377,4.9623115577889445

This movie is a total keeper.",1109808000,,310,4.344827586206897
1019535,5,6305326940,"This is one of very few computer-animated movies that I have seen that makes the genre one truly to rank alongside cartoons as a way of telling stories that do not require the time, trials, tribulations and, yes, money to make live-action movies. Yet the cartoon medium, especially when Disney has anything to do with it, has always been one designed principally to make otherwise unlovable creatures lovable with human characteristics and a sense (or lack) of morality.

This Pixar Animations movie focuses on a lovable, yet flawed character, who wants to make himself better in the eyes of his fellows, but ends up being shunned and even exiled before circumstances dictate that he should return as the hero. The difference here is that the main character is not human, rather it is an ant named Flik (voiced with conviction by Dave Foley), who ends up being the (very) unlikely hero when his colony is threatened with being ""squished"" by the evil Hopper (voiced with chilling excellence by Kevin Spacey), unless they accede to his demands for food - the ant/grasshopper equivalent of ""protection money"".

The straw that broke the proverbial camel's back for the colony is when Flik's harvesting machine goes out of control just at the wrong place at the wrong time, resulting in all the food for the grasshoppers ending up in the river just as Hopper and his cronies are arriving. Hopper is enraged as he confronts Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and demands an explanation for this apparent lack of obedience. Hopper seizes Atta's younger sister, Dot (Hayden Panettiere), but Flik, for whom Dot has a soft spot, throws caution to the wind and tries to stop Hopper, much to the astonishment of all the ants. Hopper nonetheless takes full control of the situation, ordering all the ants to prepare another offering, even if food supplies are running low.

The colony is clearly unwilling to stand up to these bullies in spite of their own overwhelming numerical superiority (something that Hopper directly refers to later on), yet the hierarchy allows Flik to leave the island on what they perceive to be a suicide mission, that is, to bring back ""bigger bugs [...] to rid [the colony] of Hopper and his gang"" - even if the real reason is so that Flik cannot possibly ruin their chances of preparing the new offering.

What follows is a classic comedy of errors when Flik mistakenly assumes that a trio of assorted insects are warrior bugs when, in a ""city bar"", he witnesses three of them challenging some other insects sporting for a fight. He pleads with them to accompany him back to the colony, but his new acquaintances mistake him for a ""talent scout"". To his horror, before an audience of ants, relieved at seeing these ""warriors"", Rosie the black widow spider (Bonnie Hunt) reveals (very discreetly) what she and her friends really are - circus performers. Hurriedly removing the ""warriors"", Flik is angry at what he perceives to be their deception, yet Manny the mantis (Jonathan Harris) accuses him of precisely the same thing. Not surprisingly, Atta becomes suspicious and distrusts him. Everything thus seems on the verge of disaster when an event involving Dot sees the ""warriors"" playing along with the deception - until their former boss, P.T. Flea (John Ratzenberger), comes looking for them and, because of his almost incessant babbling, the ants realize what the ""warriors"" actually are.

Atta immediately exiles Flik, yet the grasshoppers soon return and force the ants to prepare food. Dot manages to escape and (inexplicably) finds her absent friend and the circus troupe. The insects try and convince Flik to return yet he, in turn, is unwilling owing his shockingly low self-esteem: ""The colony's right - I just make things worse."" However, the colony's need is greater than that of just one individual (a theme explored in ""Antz""), so they return to carry out their original plan to get rid of Hopper, using a facsimile of the one thing that the bully is most afraid of. It almost works, except that, once again, P.T., not realizing what is really going on, scuppers this in a somewhat ""inflammatory"" fashion. An enraged Hopper tries to assert his dominance when he tells the ants that they are ""mindless, soil-shoving losers"". Despite being ""dealt with"", Flik shows his true mettle and openly confronts the bully: ""We're a lot stronger than you say we are!""  What happens next is predictable. As with all good guy/bad guy stories, the bad guy somehow has to get his comeuppance - and, since it is, as Hopper puts it to Atta, ""a bug-eat-bug world out there"", one can guess how it all ends.

The chemistry between the cast members is all too evident, as the characters interact with vigor and vitality, thus helping to make this flick (no pun intended!) and the morality tale within it a highly enjoyable and entertaining experience for all the family, not just the little ones. What is even more enjoyable, in case the little ones are sad at what happens to one character in particular, are the deliberately made out-takes, so that the animated characters now become animated actors.

1019538,5,6305326940,"This film was originally released in 1998, but I didn't actually see it until a few months ago.  Simply put, it's Pixar doing what they do best.  A widely caried and excellent cast of characters, a simple but elaborately executed plot, and of course, the rendition of a half a dozen themes that run universal throughout our lives.
Essentially, a mild and nerdy ant known as Flic accidentally destroys the entire food supply of his ant colony.  Of course, the food was not for them; it was their yearly offering to the grasshoppers.  As a result, the grasshoppers decree that the ants can spend the remainder of summer gathering it all again.  Hopper, the ingenius and menacing leader, notes that Flic stands up to him for one brief moment, and this becomes pivotal later.  I won't say any more past there, only that there are plenty of intriguing twists to keep things interesting.
Overall, this movie bears an obvious resemblance to Finding Nemo.  First of all, both movies involve the creation and manipulation of a natural environment and its inhabitants.  Second, they both involve unlikely heroes (A bumbling ant and a fearful clownfish).  Third, both are at a standard of quality that the animation world has never before seen.
Honestly, Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Hopper is reason enough to see A Bug's Life.  (I could say the same thing about Albert Brooks' portrayal of Marlin in Finding Nemo.)  However, the movie offers much more in the long run, and the special features are deep and surprisingly un-boring.  The director's commentary of this movie and other Pixar films is much, much more entertaining than most movies.  I credit a lot of that to Andrew Stanton, but the guys just have a creative knack to them that makes their ideas and comments brilliant.
Recommended to all fans of animation, all lovers of Pixar, and all those with good taste.",1089417600,,1861,4.832807570977918

The protaganist Flick was a character that has made a difference in my life because he had the courage to stand up to the antagonists, the grasshoppers. The main antagonist was Hopper who was head of the grasshoppers and was taking food from the little bugs and when Flick made the plan to fight them off he just showed a side of bravery and courage. If I were ever a bug, I would want to be just like Flick and if I wereever in a situation like that I could be just as brave as him.",1082678400,,571,4.2
1019613,4,6305326940,"""The Battle of the Bugs"" is what the media labeled Dreamworks SKG's successful attempt to get their 3-D animated bug story released in theaters before Disney did, although the former began production several weeks after the latter. Whose film would be released first: The Company of Michael Eisner, or that of his former disgruntled employee Jeffrey Katzenberg? In retrospect, this behind-the-scenes drama seems more than a bit silly, because: 1) That a similarly-themed movie is released first does not necessarily guarantee bigger box office than its competition, and 2) The solidly-PG-rated ANTZ has less in common with the indisputably-G-rated A BUG'S LIFE than one might think, and 3) Therefore, each film attracted a different audience. As it turned out, both films were smash hits: ANTZ garnered better reviews; however, A BUG'S LIFE made a lot more money (as I'm sure it was destined to do).
Walt Disney Pictures' A BUG'S LIFE, co-directed by Andrew Stanton and John Lasseter, and released in October of 1998 (a full month after Dreamworks SKG's ANTZ), tells the very cute story of a not-so-bright worker ant simply named Flik, voiced by Canadian comedian Dave Foley. His constant bumbling attempts to help the ant colony drive the others to distraction, and to loathe him. I love the opening scene with Flik accidentally losing the yearly ""offering"" of food meant for the grasshoppers, who regularly exploit the ants for their own purposes. This leads to a very funny scene in which the grasshoppers angrily confront the ants, and demand satisfaction.
My advice is to see this film with an open mind; forget about ""The Battle of the Bugs"" as A BUG'S LIFE has really nothing whatsoever to do with ANTZ, with the only exception being that both films star a nerdy ant who attempts to win the affection of the ant colony princess. That's the only similarity! Otherwise, A BUG'S LIFE is a rather light story dealing with Flik's attempt to woo Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus, brilliantly expressive in a superb comedic role) while he attempts to fix the aforementioned mess he made. Unfortunately for Flik, he is sent out of the ant colony all alone, and into the vast unknown, supposedly populated by big, scary bugs and other creatures. In his search for fierce warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers, Flik unknowingly comes across a ""bug circus"" in which he is convinced that he has found the muscle that the ant colony needs. In what is one of the funniest scenes, Flik is welcomed back as the unlikely hero of the ant colony, impresses Princess Atta and then proceeds to find out the truth about these circus-performer bugs he has brought back with him. These bugs are hilarious, by the way. With Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce), Heimlich the big fat German-accented caterpillar (Joe Ranft), the tough-talking male ladybug (Denis Leary), and Manny the old British-accented 'thespian bug' (Jonathan Harris--yep, Dr. Smith himself!), this is truly a motley crew of bugs if there ever was one. But the bug that really steals the show is the villain; the evil grasshopper leader Hopper (Kevin Spacey). Spacey's vocal performance is brilliant; so much so, in fact, that I had no idea it was Kevin Spacey until the first time I saw the end credits!
Spacey is hilariously deadpan while delivering lines like: ""Do I look stupid to you? Do I? Do I...look...STUPID...to YOU? Let's just think about the logic for a second, shall we? If it [the offering] was UP THERE, why would I be DOWN HERE, LOOKING FOR IT??"" Of course, as a typically self-referential Disney film, the screenwriters couldn't resist having fun with another Hopper line: ""It's one of those Circle-of-Life things."" Unfortunately, they gave some of the film's worst lines to The Queen (Phyllis Diller); for example, ""It's our lot in life. It's not a lot, but it's our life! Ahahahaha!!"" I'm sure Phyllis was paid enough to not care so much about the corniness of her lines, but still!
A BUG'S LIFE is an absolute triumph of 3-D CGI animation. It is a beautiful film to look at. The images are bright, sharp and colorful. This film offers a much better viewing experience than ANTZ, which has a more engaging storyline, but has mostly sepia-toned imagery that is neither as sharp or realistic-looking. Again, these are completely two different films: ANTS, with its mildly adult language, themes and occasional violence, is definitely PG-rated. Its humor is appreciated more by adults than kids. A BUG'S LIFE, however, is deservedly G-rated. You can let your 4-year-old watch it, and even though they probably won't be able to follow the storyline (as meager as it is), they will certainly be entertained by both the imagery and the funny voices over and over again. There may be a scene or two that may scare them a little; however, it says a lot that the scariest character in the film is a red robin.
The final verdict in my review: A BUG'S LIFE is a very entertaining combination of 3-D animation and excellent voice-over acting by excellent (and very well-cast) actors such as all who were previously named, plus Madeline Kahn, Bonnie Hunt, Michael McShane, John Ratzenberger and Brad Garrett. It is true that ANTZ has a better story; however, A BUG'S LIFE has superior animation. In addition, this was the Disney film that originated the idea of creating fake 'outtakes' to show over the end credits. Originally, I found this practice to be quite odd, but now I kind of like it. This Collector's Edition has even more bonus features than the original DVD. Now a two-DVD set, A BUG'S LIFE is really loaded; besides the behind-the-scenes featurette, there are interactive games that are sure to provide additional entertainment for your little ones, and maybe even for yourself.

The animation is great, but Finding Nemo is so much better. The story line is good, but not as good as it could have been, I thought. The dialogue is wonderful in some parts, but in other parts its not so great, especially when a bit of dirty humor came into play (for pity's sake, this is a kids movie!) .

1019615,5,6305326940,"""Toy Story"" will always be considered one of modern cinema's greatest achievements.  Unfortunately, movies like ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" will always be brushed by the wayside for the fact that they weren't first.  That's a shame, because both movies had better plots and performances.  ""A Bug's Life"" is funny.  It has a great cast of characters that are more memorable than ""Woody"" or ""Buzz"" and the villain, ""Hopper,"" is one of the best villains in Disney history.  His fate is also right up there with greats like ""Scar"" from ""Lion King"" and ""Hades"" from ""Hercules.""
Dave Foley is fun as ""Flik.""  He's kind of a geeky lookin' guy in real life, so that made this character more believable.  As state before, ""Hopper"" is the ultimate bad guy, and Kevin Spacey plays him perfectly.  Denis Leary is outstanding as ""Francis"" the ladybug.  Overall, this is an ensemble cast that is rounded out by great support from actors like John Ratzenberger and Phyllis Diller.
The animation is wonderful.  It is bright, bold, and downright terrifying when need be(ref. the bird attacking ""Hopper."")  The music is good, though not as utilized as in ""Toy Story.""  That is beside the point since the story of ""Bug's"" is so much better than ""Toy Story.""
Why is it that a Disney flick that is seriously funny always seems to get lost behind dramas such as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?""  In Disney's storied history I've always felt that movies like ""A Bug's Life"" were overlooked because they don't have some great moral story to them.  Granted, ""Flik"" realizing that he must never give up and the rest of the ants learning about strength in numbers is good, but these lessons just don't stick like in other films.
Watch this movie because it is funny.  I used to give it a less than stellar rap until I watched it again.  It really is funny and deserves to go down as one of Disney/Pixar's best films ever.
The DVD provides some great extras.  There is literally something for everyone.  For the kiddies there are games, for producer/director wannabes there are documentaries on the creation of the film.  The best extras are the entire group of ""bloopers"" from the film, with personal favorites listed by members of the production team and, of course, ""Geri's Game.""  This made me laugh out loud in the theater and at home.

A selling point for me was the second DVD supposedly filled with great extras. I was disappointed to find that when I watched this second DVD I saw the Pixar crew doing these dumb little paradoies which they must have thought were funny, but which I found to be a total waste of DVD space.
I wanted to see how they made the film, in-depth views on the making of the characters, the story, and how the people behind the film developed their ideas. Instead I got The Three Stooges telling terrible jokes along with a muppet flea.

1019617,5,6305326940,"Having recently re-seen this movie, i had already forgotten how good it really was. Pointing out that Monsters or Toy Story 2 was better really does not do it justice: All by itself, this movie is probably better than anything but one or two others that came out in the same year, and still pretty much on the top five list of all time great animated films.
The story is good for both kids and adults, though it contains some violent scenes at the end. But the most amazing feature for me is the depth of the story, which really gains as you watch it more often. The simple good/evil plot with gadgetery and a genius inventor / thinker-out-of the box is just a surface layer. Hidden underneath (and missed by literally all critics of the original film) is a story of rebellion of the people against tyranny. A rather more complex topic.
(spoiler ahead - read only if you have seen the film)
As Hopper says to his troops towards the end of the movie: ""These Ants outnumber us 100 to 1. What if they ever figure that out?"". And, indeed, the happy end does not come the way you would expect your typical hollywood popcorn flick, where a gadget wins freedom and happyness for the ants.

In comparison to Antz, this movie wins out hands down with the younger crowd, as the other movie is written on too high of a level for the younger viewer to really follow.  The action here is better and more fun and the characters more colorful.

1019621,4,6305326940,"""A Bug's Life"" is actually my least favorite movie from Pixar. However, Pixar's worst is (at least so far) better than the best many other studios can produce, and ""Bug's Life"" is still a fun movie to watch.
The story of ""A Bug's Life"" is mainly about an ant named Flik, who is trying to save his ant colony from the bullying rule of a group of grasshoppers. He enlists the aid of a few circus bugs to help the ants fight the grasshoppers, but eventually, it is Flik's ideas which provide the main inspiration for the colony, and the strongest possibility for their liberation.
There's lots of funny jokes and lots of drama in ""A Bug's Life."" It's a clever film, but in the end, not a very moving one. When I compare it to the ""Toy Story"" movies or ""Finding Nemo"" or (especially) ""Monsters Inc,"" I find that all of those films made me laugh and cry, and most importantly, they made me feel for these digital characters they create. The characters in ""A Bug's Life"" seem not quite so well developed -- they seem clever, but shallow.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. It's a fun film for my kids and I to watch together, and technically, the animation is pretty amazing. For me, it simply lacked some of the emotional depth of the other movies Pixar made, and so is a slight disappointment when compared to those other movies.

As a way to get rid of him while they met the increased demands, the colony sends him off to find warrior bugs to protect them.

This movie already seems to be delegated to the bottom of Pixar's list of movies, which is a real shame.  As with all their movies, it's wonderful.  The action keeps up at a brisk pace, the characters are likeable, the voice talent is wonderful, and there are plenty of laughs for everyone.  This is also the first of their movies to feature outtakes.  The animation does date the movie a little.  The bugs look a little plasticy.  However, some of the effects are wonderful, especially the fog and rain.

1019734,5,6305326940,"The sophomore slump doesn't apply to computer animation studio Pixar. ""A Bug's Life""  stands as a worthy follow up to Pixar's 1995 classic ""Toy Story"".  To find a film that celebrates bravery, loyalty, individuality and the power of imagination in such a  entertaining package is cause for great celebration.

But before discussing this film's virtues, which are many, I must applaud the wonderful Pixar short film Geri's Game. Pixar has outdone themselves by infusing such a delightful romp of a short. Watching a delicious short subject before a feature harkens back to a time when film going marked a major event. Thank you Pixar for such quality.

Like the equally classic and excellent ""Toy Story"" series and their super fun latest romp ""Monster's Inc."" , ""A Bug's Life""  is a classy event that children can enjoy along with adults. Every scene is a luscious and rich tapestry. The art of animation enables the most ornate of children's illustrations to breathe and move in vivid detail almost impossible to render in a live action film. There is a fully three dimensional sheen, sparkle and shine to the color palettes illuminated here. Although many hand painted cell animation purists may bristle at the notion, computer generated animation supplies the filmmaker with an even more complete tool box to the craft of fantasy storytelling.
Computer animation is really made for the DVD format. Boy how these films glisten on DVD!
The story, respectfully borrowing elements from ""The Seven Samurai"", Italian Filmmaker Federico Fellini, ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""  and even a bit of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", concerns the efforts of Flick, a genius in the rough worker ant, attempting to aid his colony from the evil marauding hordes of Hopper (cunningly voiced by Kevin Spacey). After an epic scale journey, Flick finds help in the form of some flea circus rejects.
The key to making an effective animated film lies in creating plausible characters. Characters can be creatures from the widest steppes of the imagination, but unless the audience connects with them, all is lost. And although I personally don't find insects as warm and cuddly as a stuffed cowboy and spaceman, these ants, grasshoppers, dung beetles, black widows and not too lady-like lady bugs are real people.
Director and scriptwriter John Lassiter provides us with an entire cast of odd balls, heroes and slimly villains. Of special note, this is the only film in history to be stolen by two twin potato bugs. This bugs are a strange hybrid of Dan Akroyd and Steve Martin's ""Wild and Crazy Guys"" and the late Hispanic actor Cantiflas. They have to be seen to be believed.
Special note must also be made of the very end. If you are not one to stay through the closing credits, stay through to the end of this one. The film's creators, not content to simply make a visually complex and complete movie, provide faux ""outtakes"" at the end. These ""deleted scenes"" may have provided the most knee-slapping cinema experience the year the film was initially released. ""Outtakes"" have now since become ritual with the Pixar people. It all began with this film.
It is the willingness to capture little moments and details like these that make this and all of Pixar's marvelous films work.  A certain contemporary film classic.",1048032000,2,3299,4.963768115942029
1019735,4,6305326940,"This visual smorgasbord is yet another triumph for Pixar, following the immense success of Toy Story and preceding Monsters Inc. and the near-masterpiece Toy Story 2.  In A Bug's Life we're following Flick, an ant who is searching for warrior insects to fight against the grasshopper horde that is terrorising his colony, forcing them to produce double rations this year.  On his travels Flick mistakes a bunch of circus bugs for real fighters and takes them back home promising victory and freedom at last.
On watching A Bug's Life I didn't have high hopes, thinking it certain that it could never be anywhere near as good as the Toy Story movies.  Although that's probably true (both of them were real breakthroughs), it's still one of the best children's movies of the 90's and follows in the ever-growing trend of making films that are appealing to older and younger audiences.  Adults will find enjoyment in the highly astute observations about bug life that are frankly innumerable; notice in particular, the queen ant's pet aphid, and a slug complaining that he got salt in his drink.  There are also some stunning set pieces, such as a bug city comprising of cardboard boxes and milk cartons that bears more than passing resemblance to New York.  Add to these camerawork that, picking up where The Lion King left off, treats its animal characters like real people in a real movie.  Add to the mix a bunch of personable characters, such as loser-turned-unlikely-hero Flick, greedy Heimlich the caterpillar who is obsessed with becoming a `beautiful butterfly' and Francis the ladybug that is sick of everyone assuming he's a she.  Although everyone in the cast is pretty much pitch perfect, notable celebrity voices are worthy of noting.  Kevin Spacey adds yet another fantastic performance to his already long list, playing Hopper, the tyrannical ruler of the grasshoppers, and David Hyde Pierce of Frasier fame is consistently hilarious as a stick insect who wants to get into real acting rather than constantly play the swords, the broom and the stick.
As for messages and morals, A Bug's Life has plenty, but thankfully none of them are as in-your-face as other similar movies.  The most obvious theme is believing in yourself, which surprisingly perhaps, doesn't come over as corny in the slightest, but works well in not only focusing on Flick but also the Princess Atta, who feels the burden of responsibility on her shoulders along with self-doubt.  There are also more than passing resemblances in the grasshopper's rule to an absolutist regime, something that is superbly realised in the finale with some really very stunning animation showing the bleak landscapes of Ant Island as well as being representative of the dreary situation in general.  Whilst erring on the side of funny the majority of the time, Bug's Life does well to be a pretty moving and genuine feature that should please everyone in the whole family.

1019736,3,6305326940,"Along with Monsters, Inc., Disney/Pixar seems to be taking us back to the industrialism that started all of our environmental problems. I grew up with Dr. Seuss' ""The Lorax"" in which we kids learned that if you chop down all the trees to make clothing, there will be no more trees, animals will die, and we will smog up our world. This movie teaches the opposite. Flek, the main character ant, is known for his inventor talents which get more work done than following tradition, and solve the ants' problems. This good-old-American idealism is great, if the ideas he had come up with were more politically correct. Instead of ants running up blades of grass to pick seeds, his machine comletely cuts off the blade of grass, denudes it, and harvests the seeds. I admit that grass is not trees, and as anyone with a lawn knows this won't cause the forest of grass to disappear. But I am surprised that such blatant destruction of the environment has been so accepted by so many people watching this movie. The grass on the little island provides protection to the ants, probably would prevent erosion during the rainy season, and even provides the clubhouse for the children ant troop. The movie focuses its message on ""not following along with everyone else when there is a better way"". The ants' only concern with Flek's inventions is the fact that it is not traditional. They do not even consider other issues.
This is my main problem with the movie, but other messages are also surprising when considering the intended audience. The bike-gang rough boy grasshoppers are just big bullies, and pretty darn scary for a child. Back again to the 1950s. My 4-year-old daughter completely refuses to see this movie. Maybe she is too young for it, but why do we need to have such incredibly scary, nasty characters in our lives? Is this a lesson of some sort? And if it is entertainment, for whom? The parents? I didn't find the grasshoppers entertaining. Just violent. And mean.
Although it may not need mentioning, I feel I cannot leave it out. Romantic love between ants? I admit that animals in children's films are not always shown portraying the characteristics they do in the wild. But the authors went as far as having only one line of females in the colony (Queen and daughters being ""trained"" for the job).

Simple, Have a good story with funny characters. The story centers around a group of ants who are forced to gather food for a group of mean grasshoppers.

1019740,5,6305326940,"For the past few years it seems that the Disney company has produced animated films that have been made for one purpose only: money.  I think that Walt Disney would roll over in his grave if he saw the likes of ""Tarzan"" or ""Atlantis"".  However, as I watch ""A Bug's Life"" I think of Walt Disney smiling and being proud of the movie, because this movie continues in his tradition of good quality, fun, and imaginative Disney films.  This is certainly the best animated (albeit computer-generated) film since Disney's own ""Beauty and the Beast"".  As weird as this sounds, I think the characters of Flick, Atta, and Dot are some of the most ""human"" characters I've seen in movies.  They all have good qualities and bad qualities, which makes you love them even more.  The movie is hilarious and doesn't take itself too seriously, and is not afraid to laugh at itself.  The script has a good message about standing up for what is right, even when that makes you unpopular, but you're never hit over the head with it.  I'm a teenager, and I just rented ""A Bug's Life"" and I've already watched it three times.  Kids, teens, and adults can all find something to love about this great movie.  The cast is amazing and perfect for each character, and even though they're computer-generated, the characters and scenery never look fake.  Also, if you have the chance to go to Disney's California Adventure or Disney's Animal Kingdom make sure to see the adorable show based on ""A Bug's Life"", ""It's Tough to Be a Bug"".

Knowing that Jeffery Katzenberg left Disney while this film and 'Armageddon' were both in production tells me a lot, since after he helped form Dreamworks, 'Antz' and 'Deep Impact' each came out from that studio. HMMMM...
Anyway, this a very likable film, with broad bits of humour that cover the entire spectrum, so that the entire family will be entertained.
Covering the exploits of Flik, a likable ant who just wants to make things better but only screws things up, the film hops along at a wonderful pace, with great dialogue and even better charactors. The voice talent is top-notch, and perfectly cast.
Really, I'm kinda tired of two-three editions of films, what with 'Gold Collection', 'Special Edition', and such, and wonder why they can't just put out one package and leave it at that.
Oh well. This film is remarkable for many things, not the least which was the inclusion of 'outtakes', specially-made 'screw-ups' by the charactors, which are every bit as funny as the actual film, itself. they alone are worth buying this film for. And, the short cartoon 'Geri's Game', which won an academy award for the studio, and is brilliant.
All in all, this film is very nearly on a level with the Toy Story films, and is positively worth the time!",1017100800,2,1400,4.741803278688525
1019844,4,6305326940,"1998 was a banner year for animated insects on screen. Both Disney and Pixar's A Bug's Life and Dreamworks' Antz were smash hits. The fact that two movies with the same subject came out so close together may be no coincidence. After being fired from Disney, Jeffery Katzenberg, who had rebuilt that studio's animated division, co-founded Dreamworks. The competition between the two companies is now legendary, and the real beneficiary is the public.
A Bug's Life is a delightfully entertaining work. Produced with the latest digital technology, it is a visual feast. The characters and scenery are beautifully rendered. The color is exquisite. And the story? Anyone over twelve years old might enjoy it, and everyone younger should be mesmerized.
Basically, this is a twist on the old children's story about the Grasshopper and the Ants. In a reflection of the changing times, these grasshoppers don't beg for food. They forcefully demand it. In fact, they can get pretty scary. Every year, at the end of summer, they fly in. The ants are expected to have harvested plenty of food for them - or else.
Our minuscule hero is Flik, an intelligent young ant who is forever inventing things to try to make life less routine, much to the amusement of the rest of the colony. When the grasshoppers' share of the food is accidentally destroyed, it's up to Flik to figure out a way to save the colony. He leaves home to seek help, and in a comedy of errors, returns with a band of unemployed bugs from a flea circus. There are butterflies, spiders, lightening bugs, lady bugs, walking sticks and even a rhinoceros beetle. All are good-natured, but none have an ounce of heroism in them. Flik must come up with a game plan before the grasshoppers return.
There is a love interest, and, of course, she is a princess. Women's Lib may have laid Prince Charming to rest, but a Princess remains a mandatory element of childhood fantasies, at least as written by adults. Another ingredient is a multitude of cute precocious kids, and this movie is full of them, tiny though they may be.
While it has a G rating, you will have to gauge your children's emotional levels. When I was a kid, I was terrified by the wicked Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I was afraid to look in a mirror, in case I found her looking back at me. There are parts of A Bug's Life which have that same typical Disney scariness. In particular, Hopper, the head grasshopper, is quite menacing. We grownups laugh at these characters, because we know that a happy ending is a prerequisite, but all small children may not be yet aware of this fact.
The music by Randy Newman is excellent. The end credits are clever. While all those names scroll up the screen, we are shown ""out takes"" from the movie which are quite amusing.",1016841600,7,2788,4.657200811359027

My 3-year old son loves it (he has practically memorized it) and I have no problem joining him and enjoying every minute. The DVD also includes a short animation which alone is almost worth the price.",1016150400,,519,4.777777777777778
1019846,5,6305326940,"""A Bug's Life"" is a simple plotted movie about the ant who always seems to invent a ""better way to do things,"" but for some reason the inventions go wrong.  The anthill where he lives, must collect food for grasshoppers annually for ""protection"" from other bugs.  One of his inventions eliminates the annual ""gift"" to the grasshoppers, and the story is off and running.  Our hero, Flik, as ""punishment,"" it sent to the ""Big City"" to find some bigger bugs to fight and hopefully chase away the grasshoppers.  Like Flik, the ""bigger bugs"" he finds are a misfit (flea) circus troupe that are trying to fit it.  However, Flik mistakes them for warrior bugs, and they mistake him as a talent scout.
A sub-plot focuses on Dot, a young little queen ant who's wings are too small for her to fly.  Dot, being cute and adorable, will steal a scene or two from the main story.
One lesson taught in this movie is that ""the gift you treasure is within you.""  You just have to look deep enough to find and cultivate it.  Within every tiny seed (or rock--you have to see the film), a mighty oak is inside.  I have mentioned this lesson taught in the film several times when doing motivational presentations or team-building exercises.
Although the pre-teen group might not understand all the jokes in the movie, they should enjoy it nonetheless.  Teens and adults should be able to catch the pokes at Disney and few other well-known companies in the jokes.  And who knows, maybe learn a thing or two about themselves in the process.
If watching the movie for the first time, watch the ""outtakes"" at the end of the movie.  When ""A Bug's Life"" was in movie theaters, there were two versions of the outtakes.  On the DVD, you can view the both versions of the ""outtakes""--both have very funny spoofs of various scenes throughout the movie.",1009324800,,1821,4.6006191950464395

The story is very simple, about an outcast that tries to fit back into his society. Then there are the bad guys, in this case Grasshoppers, that are beyond cruel and may be too intense for VERY young viewers.
All of the characters are likable & creative. My favorite twist, the Male Ladybug, was genius. The world seen through the eyes of bug's was obviously thoroughly planned and thought through becuase every inch of the different cities, ""sets"", or landscapes were right on target and were totally believable.

But the slew of excellent bonus features make this good film into an exceptional DVD.  The Pixar crew does some of the best DVD commentary I've heard, filling you in on little in-jokes, behind the scenes story processes, and technical info all the while sounding very natural and spontaneous.  You'll find just about everything you could possibly hope for on the bonus disc in terms of artwork.  Drawings trace characters from their sketchy beginings to final form.  You also get a look at the first version of the story, which is vastly different from the end product.

Both are great productions, but I like ""A Bug's Life"" a little more.  If my memory serves me correctly, ""A Bug's Life"" came out in movie theaters a couple of weeks after ""Antz"" hit the movie theaters, it seems to me that Disney did that on purpose just to directly compete against Dreamworks.  I think it was a good competitive move for Disney, but not so good for Dreamworks.  Well, the DVD Gold Collection is pretty good, it has two different versions of the out-takes and it has the humorous short film ""Geri's Game"", which is my favorite short film from Pixar.

Going with the theme of CGI films, I would recommend Dreamworks's ""Shrek"", and Columbia's ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"".

The picture detail on this DVD is absolutely flawless. Since this is the world's first digital to digital transfer. Congratulations to PIXAR for another great innovation! Too bad the only put a anamorphic transfer on the Collector's Edition DVD for those of you with widescreen TVs. The sound on this is great too. I can't really say much since my sound system is a puny 2.0 channel plain sterieo. But I'm sure it would be good. The extras on this disc are unbelievably low. Nothing that you couldn't see at the theater. They didn't even include a trailer. That's why I would prefer the Collector's Edition DVD to this anyday.

I'm going to pay my respects for Madenline Kahn since this was her last filmography (or second to last) before her untimely death. I will not elaborate since I have only seen her in two roles. She was just right for the role of Gypsy. Perfect voice. That's all I'll say.

The youngest person in my family is 14, and ""A Bug's Life"" still manages to be one of our most frequently watched movies. It's based on the old moral about the ant and the grasshopper, where the ant spends all summer working to prepare for the coming winter while the grasshoper lazily puts it off until it's too late. Here it is a colony of ants forced into working for the grasshoppers every year so that they barely have enough food for themselves to last the hard winters. All that changes when Flick, a well-intentioned yet clumsy ant, goes off in search of mighty warriors to help them fight off the grasshoppers once and for all. But in a twist of fate, he accidentally hires down-on-their luck circus bugs instead. The premise is somewhat cliched, that anyone can be a hero if they believe in themself - but it is told freshly and with humor.

I'll begin on disk 1. Well, there is the basic movie, a commentary track, an audio only track and a sountrack only track.  The basic movie is very well done, and maybe even better than the theatrical version because of the conversion process and sound quality.  Superb stuff, but its also available on the regular version so we'll move on.  The commentary track is very insightful and actually provides a lot of information about the process of making the movie.  Its very interesting to listen to and will keep you watching, unlike most commentary tracks where the speakers generally just drag on and on about how great the actors are or something similar without actually talking about the movie.  The soundtrack only section is pretty interesting, and it lets you hear the more subtle parts that you miss with FX and voice, but it gets pretty tiring.  The FX track, on the other hand, was absolutely riveting for some reason.  You would think a track with no voice and no music would be boring to all hell, but in fact it was incredibly entertaining to watch and it really lets you get a sense into the amount of effort they put into the sound.  Things you don't even notice or realize are happening in the background are made very clear on this track.  I would recommend this edition for anyone who is thinking about going into Sound FX later in life simply for this track.
 On to disk 2 now, which is pretty much all design sketches and production notes.  There are some really fascinating things on this disk as well.  They go through all the stages from beginning to end and you really get to see the story evolve from its original form (recognizable, but oh so different).  Also, the short feature on turning the storyboard art into 3d art was very interesting (especially if you want to go into graphics).
 In the end this is a DVD I think any A Bug's Life fan will love.

On the way, he hires a certain motley crew of circus bugs to head off some rather troublesome grasshoppers (led by the awesome Kevin Spacey). The film  also explores moral issues, and is of course technically stunning to anyone in the animation business (the initial reason why I went to see it - but came out with a thousand different ones for going!).

A Bug's Life, however is pretty much the same formulated and trite Disney film that he have all seen a million times before wrapped in some flashy new computer animation.
The movie starts out with Flick(an ant) trying to find a more efficient way to gather nuts.  Flick is part of a colony and doesn't fit in.  The evil grasshopers force the poor ants to give them food every year.  Flick decides the only way to end this is to this is to get some ""warrior bugs"" to come and get rid of the grasshoppers.  However, being a niave little ant, he instead gets a bunch of circus rejects by mistake.  If this sounds familiar, it should.  It's the same old contrived plot that we have seen more times that we can count in Disney films and other films.  Anyone with half a brian can guesse what is going to happen.  The ""warrior bugs"" are going to be exposed as fakes but the ants are going to find the strenght to defeat the grasshoppers themselves.  How touching.
The film has a few amusing parts but for the most part A Bug's Life is a total disapointment.

This deluxe collectors edition disc is packed full of supplimental materials. Probably my favorite of those are the outtakes that they created. What a great idea to add in.

1020142,5,6305326940,"""A Bug's Life"" is a fantastic movie, full of comedy, drama, and charm.  You feel for those poor ants and you can't help but cheer them on.  But, wait a minute...the Disney plagiarism machine is at work yet again!  After all the flak that Disney endured because its movie ""The Lion  King"" was so similar to the Japanese animation classic ""Leo The  Lion"", you'd think they'd have learned their lesson.  Well, they  haven't.
This time, Disney & Friends have decided to rip off  ANOTHER Japanese classic movie, albeit a rather obscure one to the average  modern American movie audience.  Their plagiaristic target?  The 1957  classic ""Seven Samurai"" --later remade into the American film  ""The Magnificent Seven"".  In this movie, a village of farmers  (Disney's ants) is under threat of pillage from the countryside-roaming  bandits (Disney's grasshoppers).  So the village dispatches a few of its  residents (Disney's Flik) to the nearest town to enlist the help of brave  samurai (Disney's big bugs).  Although there are a few plot changes,  probably just so Disney can stay one step ahead of a copyright infringement  lawsuit, the big bugs eventually help defend the village from the attackers  and all ends well.
Despite all the story-stealing, Disney has managed  to produce a visually stunning movie.  The DVD image is unbelievably clear,  crisp, and super sharp.  With a large screen TV, you will swear you're  there with the ants sharing in their adventure.  The audio is excellent,  with neither the dialog nor the music being too soft nor too loud (DVD  producers, take note: there's nothing more irritating than having to crank  up the volume because the dialog's barely audible, only to have the house  rattle when the music or sound effects kick in!).  I have the standard  edition of the DVD, so there aren't many extras.  There is an alternate  French audio track.  AND there are the much-loved outtakes during the end  credits, both sets in fact!  These are hilarious and, in my opinion, are  actually funnier than the movie.  I'd pay to watch a whole DVD of such  outtakes.  If there's ever the possibility of a DVD wearing out, mine will  be at the outtakes, for I often pop the DVD in the player just to watch  those.  They are truly funny.
So, despite my beef about the plagiarism, I  must give Disney kudos for cranking out a top-quality product.  But you  still owe it to yourself to check out the original film from which this was  taken, the Japanese classic ""Seven Samurai"".  It's a wonderful  movie that's suitable for the whole family.",965692800,3,2558,4.841491841491841
1020143,5,6305326940,"Flick has never fitten in with the rest of the ants. He dose things  diffrently, he likes to create things and make them work.

So when  Flick's new invention knocks over the offering stone, which full of food  for the grasshoppers, the other ants would like to tear them limb form limb  but there too busy collecting more food for the grasshoppers. So Flick  comes up with an idea to find warrior bugs to defeat the grasshoppers. The  other ants agree with him just to get rid of em. But when Flick actually  dose come back with ""bigger bugs"" he's considered a hero. Unless  they find out that the ""warrior bugs"" are actually circus bugs!  This is a great movie!

1020144,5,6305326940,"This is probably not going to surprise anyone-- This is simply an excellent DVD, in every scale. The first disc contains the movie itself, which is transferred from its original, digital source. The picture quality  is unbelievable. Not one spot comes up during the movie, not one scratch  appears-- because this wasn't transferred from film. This is the way A  Bug's Life should be watched. The colors are amazing, bright and contrast  eachother perfectly.  The sound is also unbelievable-- this movie  challanged my 1.5 surround system perfectly. Unlike some other movies I've  seen, where the two rear speakers are only used about twice in the movie, A  Bug's Life uses them almost constantly-- You can hear the crickets and  cicadas all around you in many of the scenes, Hopper's gang are flying at  you from behind; Even with a simple scene like the ""Royal Huddle""  the ant's footsteps are coming from around you.  The first disc contains a  Cinemascope widescreen version and a pan-and-scan version. I'll have to say  that if you don't have a widescreen TV (I don't), you probably should  forget about the widescreen version here as it is aspecially small.  Besides, the PSP version was edited digitally in a very special way, even  described on this DVD-- you hardly miss anything in the PSP version because  of that special editing. If anything, you actually get to see more detail.  Also on the first disc are two special audio choices, Music Only (cool) and  SFX only (VERY cool), and a director's commentary (quite cool, although not  the best I've heard. John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich seem to  talk too much about the story, which sometimes makes it sound as if they're  just describing what you already see on screen.)
(I'm not going to give  review to the movie itself here-- In short, it is definitly a 5 star  movie!)
The second disk is where the real fun begins. I've never seen so  many extras, with so many choices to choose from. It's almost confusing--  You not only get to see how they made the movie, you get to literally see  how they developed EACH AND EVERY character in this film. It's astonishing.  You can also hear how they edited the sound, see how they made the PSP  version so good, see how they made the outtakes at the end (and also see  the outtakes by themselves, clean, full screen and with no credits to  interrupt), see an interview with the characters themselves (which is  simply hilarious), and... See Geri's Game in all its glory. And there's  even more.
Basically, if you don't have this DVD, you WILL buy it.  Otherwise, what's the point of having a DVD?",964396800,113,2616,4.725055432372505

With this and the ""Toy  Story"" films they have a perfect record, and one can only hope that  they keep it up.

Clearly  Dreamworks wanted their film out first, which is obvious in the inferior  visual look and the not-always-appropriate voice-casting of their product.  The only complaint with ""A Bug's Life"" that I have is that the  film didn't have some kind of dedication message to Roddy McDowall, who  voiced Mr. Soil.

The Movie:
Original Film Review, Written On The Film's Opening Weekend:
The second of the Fall's animated insect projects wasn't nearly  as appealing to me as the first. ""A Bug's Life"" boasts  outstanding animation, but a lackluster and predictable plot. Possibly I  just felt that way as an adult and maybe it's just my cynical nature, but I  doubt I wouldn't have found this film just as predictable when I was  younger.
That said, all that's left is to sit back and marvel at the  animation put together by the same group that put together ""Toy  Story"" a couple of years ago, Pixar. There's definitely a sense of  wonder, terror and awe in the animation in scenes like when a bird comes  into the ant colony for an attack, or when one of the ants rides a  dandelion spore across a great divide. There's one major difference here in  the animation from ""Antz"", it's that the animation here is  rounded and safe, much like the plot and story; in ""Antz"",  structures had interesting shapes and edges; you never knew what to expect  next from the film.
This film has great moments, like when the ants can't  figure out how to get around a leaf that has fallen in front of  them(although I didn't quite get that, since I would think the ants could  see over the leaf, but I guess I was putting too much thought into it.) As  many great visual moments as the film has, I just couldn't help feel that  it's trapped by the Disney formula of one unlikely hero rising above  ""it all"" to save the day. That's definitely nothing new to  filmmaking, but there's a certain Disney plot line that makes everything  that's about to happen fairly obvious to an adult before they set foot in  the theater.
The story is set around Flik, a young inventor ant who is  voiced by Dave Foley(TV's ""Newsradio""). That's where the film  loses bite; ""Antz"" had an edgy, funny lead in Z(Woody Allen),  Foley doesn't bring any of the wit and cynicism that his television  character holds. Julia Louis Dreyfuss, who voices Princess Atta, the ant,  isn't nearly as funny or sassy as Sharon Stone's ant princess in  ""Antz"". The one character who does turn out quite well is Hopper,  the king of the Tyrant grasshoppers, who is voiced by Kevin Spacey, who  provides a perfect dose of menace in his voice to make the character  interesting.
The film starts out with the ant colony collecting food for  the grasshoppers, like usual. In an unfortunate mistake, Flik spills all  the food. The grasshoppers, led by Hopper, demand that the ants provide  twice the food by the end of Summer; not content to walk away, Flik sets  out to find bigger insects in the insect city to help the colony fight back  against the grasshopper menace; who he finds are, unknown to him, a band of  circus insects, who, in turn, don't know that they're being hired to fight  in a war against the grasshoppers.
Again, the animation is wonderful and,  to be honest, although it's more safe feeling than ""Antz"",  ""A Bug's Life"" does do a better job at providing the scope of  this miniature world, from the leaves and grass to the stones and ant  tunnels. The only thing I didn't quite care for was the way the ants are  animated here; they looked more real to me in ""Antz"", here they  look meant to sell a thousand Disney toys. I did like the fact that the  film is in the wide 2.35:1 ratio, making the wide spaces of the grassy  colony and the insect city more fascinating to watch.
In conclusion,  ""A Bugs Life"" will provide families with a good time for a few  hours and actually, maybe I just didn't quite care for this film because  I'm simply not its intended audience. The legions of kids seemed to like  the film and, in reality, the majority of kids will likely enjoy this film;  adults may find it just okay. I'm not sure if either will find it as  enjoyable or as funny as Pixar's previous film, ""Toy Story"",  though.
The DVD
VIDEO: Goregous 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer that is a  direct-digital transfer and I really can't think of a disc that has more  impressive image quality. As good as ""Prince Of Egypt""is, this  anamorphic transfer turns out to be just a touch better. Images are  absolutely razor sharp throughout the presentation, and detail is  absolutely outstanding. There is also a depth and dimension to this image  that is remarkable. Don't get me started on the colors; you have to see  them to believe how stunning they look. Colors are absolutely vibrant and  even breathtaking during this movie. They also look a little bit stronger  than one the image quality that was included with the previous, movie-only  edition.
There are absolutely no flaws to speak of during this  presentation. No shimmer, nothing in the way of artifacts like that at all.  If you're looking for a disc that shows off the capabilities of DVD in  terms of picture quality, there really isn't anything more perfect than  this.
SOUND:Fascinating detail in the sounds of the ants creeping up the  stalks of grass in the begining of the film. The sound is not only  agressive and full of wonderful effects, but it has a playfulness about it  that's incredibly fun to listen to. It's all in the details, though and  there are plenty here. Like ""Antz"", the environment and ambient  noise seems to be built with phenomenal attention to even the littlest of  details. The sounds of little ants running about is rendered wonderfully  and throughout all of it, there's even some nice touches of bass,  especially when a bird attacks the insect colony. Dialogue is clear, clean  and is integrated nicely. Randy Newman's score sounds wonderful as well. A  very pleasing presentation by Disney. What's really amazing on this DVD is  the additional sound tracks that you can listen to. On the full frame  edition, you can listen to a seperate track that is an isolated effects  track, where there is no dialogue or music, but you hear every single sound  effect and where it's placed in the sound field. This additional effects  track is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and included on the full screen version. On  the widescreen version, the extra track is a 2.0 isolated score. I wish the  FX track was with the widescreen and the score was with the full-screen,  but oh well. What I'll also complain about is that the audio can't be  changed with the remote.
MENUS:: Phenomenal animated menus during the  disc for the film itself, but even more stunning animation greets you when  you first turn on the 2nd DVD, as you're lead through the ant tunnels into  the Pixar screening room where you're given an introduction by the director  and three other members of the ""Bug's Life"" crew. Some of the  sub-menus are not animated, but most of the main ones are, at least  slightly.
EXTRAS:. Commentary: This is a commentary track from director  John Lasseter, editor Lee Unkrich and co-director Andrew Stanton. The trio  mainly talk about the inspirations behind the research that the crew did  for how their film was going to take a look into the world of an insect.  Like the commentary from ""Antz"", the filmmakers start talking a  little bit about the science aspects of the world of bugs, but they cut  that topic off and thankfully, focus more about the technical and story  aspects of the movie. I didn't find it overall as informative or  entertaining as the ""Antz"" commentary, but there are plenty of  cool details and tidbits offered up throughout. I just felt that this  commentary talked more about the story than the technical details.
The  three are quite funny as well, talking about making the character of Flik a  big geek, then going on to mention that ""we didn't have to do too much  research for that."" The group talks a lot about the ideas for Flik and  the concepts that they had not only for the character, but how he would  interact with the rest of the characters in the story. In terms of story  and plot talk, the more interesting details are about what we didn't see ,  as the animators talk about coming up with story details that didn't make  it into the final picture or talking about the process of coming up with  the story, as they talk quite a bit about how scenes were thought out and  built. If the commentators are going to talk about the story more than the  details, I'd rather hear about the meetings behind-the-scenes where the  concepts were thought out or what didn't make it into the final plot rather  than talking about just what is going on on-screen or what the characters  are thinking. It's not a bad commentary by any means, but I lost interest  through some parts of the discussion.
DVD TWO: THE EXTRA FEATURES The  additional features on this disc are broken down into sections of the  animation process. I'm going to go into detail about what each section  contains. This second DVD has a running time of 107 minutes.
PRE-PRODUCTION: ""Fleabie"" Reel: There is an introduction to  this additional feature, where the crew talks about how they came up with  this film that showed a strage little character named Fleabie taking the  tour of the animation stu",946166400,18,9101,4.62531328320802

I'm fairly up to date with animated films and can say that I thought the picture quality was magnificent, it really was.  The sound was excellent and the story  good.

Although the script is not hilarious, the jokes are certainly enough to keep you smiling  through out.  As a film this is a thouroughly enjoyable watch all round.  As for the DVD version of this film; well its simply stunning and with all  these extra features the special edition is a must have for any  animated-film fan!",945475200,2,460,4.27906976744186

They included everything in this two disc edition.  Not only do we get both sets of  outtakes, but we get Geri's Game (old man playing chess), the trailers  (including one for international release), deleted scenes, storyboards,  pictures, making of segments and more.  It can easily take you 3 hours to  go through all the extras on this disc.  If you have ever wanted to know  how this movie was made, this disc will tell you!",944611200,33,553,4.494949494949495

1020589,5,6305326940,"When I first purchased my DVD player this June, I made a b-line for the rental store for Bugs Life, hoping to relive some of the magic I remembered from seeing the film at the cinema house. What I discovered, though, was  that the images were so clean, vibrant, colorful and striking, that I was  too busy looking 'at' the film that I had a difficult time 'watching' the  film. Pixar did a great job with assembling a touching and imaginative film  here, but what remains for me is that the DVD stands as the benchmark for  all that the DVD format delivers.",943833600,15,557,4.368932038834951

This movie also tells  a great story that adults can enjoy, too. (Note: I loved it and I don't  even have kids!) The DVD contains both widesreen and full screen versions  of the movie. The full screen version was re-rendered for DVD. Instead of  just chopping the sides off of the picture, Pixar moved all the important  elements onto the 4:3 screen. I think the 4:3 version actually looks better  on TV. They also have great special features, including  ""bloopers"" and an ingenious, entertaiing film short about an old  man playing chess.

I can watch  Antz everyday with my kid and still find it funny. But just to sum it all  up : buy the Bugs life video for your kids.,930268800,,410,4.472972972972973

The story is weak and often makes little sense, the  characters are 'flat', the music is unmemorable, and it just isn't that  funny. Also, the Disney saccharine combined with the violence of the  storyline leaves a disagreeable taste, in my view.  In short,  ""Antz"" is a much better and funnier movie.

1021001,3,6305326940,"As a parent that has watched Toy Story about 50 times and enjoyed it every time, I was pretty shocked when I went to preview this movie in the theater.
After the first 20 minutes, I had my answer, not only was this  ""No Toy Story"", it wasn't even funny.
I did later see the whole  movie in the theater and came away with the same opinion.
How ironic that  I would rent Bug's Life on 4/21, the day after the Columbine shootings.  This movie has no less than a dozen references to ""killing"" and  ""death"".  How do the ants resolve conflict?  By fighting of  course.  Go get some warriors!  It's payback time!
I did finally watch  this with my 4 year old, stopping every 5 minutes to remind him that  ""it's just a movie"" and ""the hoppers are the bad guys and  good guys always win.""
I have a totally different view of this movie  from a Home Theater-buff standpoint.  By god, this is my new demo disk!  The first 20 minutes, up until the first departure of the hoppers is  awesome.
Every moment that Kevin Spacey's character is on the screen is  priceless.
I too found it difficult to choose between the standard and  letterbox versions.  I usually choose letterbox to see the  ""whole"" movie but having Hopper's ugly mug filling my 51""  screen was quite impressive.
If I sound prudish, so be it, but someone  needs to start questioning the amount of violence in a ""kid's""  movie.",925776000,8,1375,4.408

Also, though, huge kudos on the DVD picture quality itself. From what I  read, this was a direct-to-disc (straight from the computer, not from the  film master), so I expected it to be clean, but not this clean.
Extra  features were great too (e.g., both versions of the outtakes), but I think  I would've like the addition of the trailer and maybe some other Disney  trailers in the ""Recommendations"" section.

I've seen it about 7 times! I went to the cinema on my  birthday to watch it, and it was packed with adults, not kids! I'd say this  is even better and more original than ""Toy Story"", and much more  original and clever (the outtakes for example) than ""Antz"". Does  anyone remember the characters' names in ""Antz""? The only one I  remember is ""Z"" (the whining sod), because it's in the title.  This is a much better view of a bug's (and ant's) life.

I found myself laughing out loud at several of it's visual gags as well as clever scripting. And, almost needless to say, it was visually stunning. Animation-wise, well... it's Disney. Of course it's a wonderful product. Disney has done it again.
And as for the criticism of the film's ""over-anthropromorphism and gross simplicity""? Ridiculous. A Bug's Life does nothing to discourage diversity by making the ants and other insects ""walk upright"". On the contrary, it's quite encouraging of diversity, as the film's content evidences throughout. The thought that the movie narrows the mind of children toward diversity is just hype and paranoia. Trust me.
