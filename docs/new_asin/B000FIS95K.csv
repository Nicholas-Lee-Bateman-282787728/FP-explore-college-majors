8123459,3,B000FIS95K,"The disc had a lot of swirls on it, but it did play. The disc is also region 9. This was not disclosed in the editorial review or the product detaits. It should have been in the product details. It would not play on my standard dvd player. I have a portable region free dvd player which was able to play the disc. I hooked up the player to my tv set and was able to watch and enjoy this movie. I would have given a four star review if the region 9 code was mentioned somewhere in the listing so that people who do not have a region 9 or region free player would know not to purchase a disc that would not play on their dvd players.",1464998400,,631,3.89922480620155

8123463,5,B000FIS95K,"This is another take on a small part of the 'Journey to the West"" saga.  It is pure fantasy and is not at all apologetic for it.  It is both very funny and very sweet -- a not unusual combination for a Hong Kong comedy.",1373068800,,219,3.8444444444444446
8123464,4,B000FIS95K,"Imaginative, creative and somewhat humorous (a little childish/dumb at times) story telling with fairly good although routine graphics to assist in conveying the story. The major problem is that the editing was too broken up or segmented from scene to scene for the viewer to feel a part of the story and thus really understand it. Too many gaps in the story for it to flow comfortably. This is particularly true for English speakers that have to depend on watching subtitles not only for what's happening at that moment but also for the background and history of the characters and story. And, especially hard when the subtitles move so quickly and are so poorly formed that while you're trying to absorb the meaning of one bit of dialogue the next has already passed you by. All this compounded with the task of trying to become engaged in the visual aspects of the story. So, four stars for a worthy effort and hopefully better next time.",1258934400,,941,4.709090909090909
8123465,5,B000FIS95K,"When the news came out about this movie I thought it would be horrible due to there being SO many big name stars in it.  With so many, they don't usually depend on a story or plot...But it's great!

You should see this just to look at Nicholas Tse!  But you also have Wilson Chen, Boyz, the lovely Twins, ect. ect.

The story is a little hard to follow if you don't know Journey To The West, but it's still a good movie.  You'll get most of the mocking of other movies.

There is a lot going on in this story but the romance is around a troll like young lady who can't help but always do the wrong thing and a virtuous young man who can't NOT do the right thing.",1230163200,,662,3.977272727272727
8123466,4,B000FIS95K,"Hmmm...

This movie was definiely not up to my expectations. There was such a lot of hype about it and from the many trailers that I watched, I already had a, you know, a sort of opinion of what I was going to get from the movie and so you can say that I got a surprise. Which was no good.

A friend of mine who also watched this show said that the plot was moving too fast and he is right. I got confused at some point of the show. Before you know it, there is so much blasting up of stuff.

Some might say that the show is funny but it is not really.

This show has really good scenery. Halfway, when I was supposed to be concentrating on the show , I found myself saying, ""Darn, that is a nice pic"" which I am not that sure makes for a fantastic plot.

The good parts of the show is Charlene Choi's character MeiYan. The transformation n the end battle was really something so was her love for Tripitaka. It was very satisfying in that sense. Near the end, the scene in the Heavenly Court was good. There was a lot of effort put into this show and it shows. And the ending was really quite well done.

I am giving it 4 stars becoz it is really pretty good. If it helps, it is below Dragon Inn (actors: maggie Cheung, Tony Leung and Bridgitte Lin) but higher than Dragon Tiger Gate (donnie yen and another nic tse movie). For those wanting quite a good movie, this is it. Don't expect to be swept of your feet becoz this won't do it but the very well-done visual effects should really be appreciated. Don't expect too much. But for someone who is looking for a reasonably good movie, with a cantonese twist, this is it. Hope that helps.",1181606400,,1638,4.1191222570532915
