7795083,1,0982388446,"I first learn Hatha yoga from John Friend over 15 yrs ago. Over time due to a host of circumstances my yoga practice fell off. I decided to reinvigorate my practice and thought that there would be no better way than to use John's new video series which included Celebrating Your Heart. The DVD says it is for all levels. There is a disclaimer at the beginning which says to modify poses and use props as necessary and all people won't be able to do all poses. Of course, if you are a beginner, you have zero idea of what props to use or how to use them and can only find out the pose is not for you after trying and potentially injuring yourself. There is no mention of modification of poses in any of the poses. This is not a beginners video. Starting with the Sun Salutation  We only work the right leg back. Triangle, half moon The bent leg lunge with a thigh stretch, virasana, and upward bow are all advanced poses which need careful instruction in order to prevent injuries. That instruction is totally lacking.
John instructs the class spouting aphorisms, but the luster he used to have is totally gone. This tape is almost depressing. John doesn't smile once the entire tape.
