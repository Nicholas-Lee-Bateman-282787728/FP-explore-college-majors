3598623,3,B001GBIOQO,It's a good workout for a beginner.  I also like that each one takes about 20 minutes. I usually add some of my own crunches because I do not think there is enough workout for the abs.  Overall not bad.,1312761600,3,202,4.025
3598624,5,B001GBIOQO,"Gilad's workouts are quick, effective, and fun! He makes the most of the half-hour by focusing on all the muscle groups and gives you an aerobic workout.",1275955200,5,153,4.703703703703703
3598625,5,B001GBIOQO,"I really enjoy Gilad's work-outs! The work-outs on this video are all bewtween 20-25 minutes. On days when I'm pressed for time, I can still squeeze in one of these work-outs rather than skipping exercise entirely & feeling guilty all day. On the days when my schedule is less hectic, I'll do one of Gilad's work-outs then go on to do some strength training with free weights. I would not consider this to be advanced in any way. A beginning exerciser could easily do it. If you've been exercising already like me, then you can just do the moves with more intensity. Some other cardio tapes I've tried were too hard to follow...I want to work my body not my brain when I'm working out. If I have to try too hard to follow them & I'm stumbling through mis-step after mis-step, at the end I don't feel like I got a good work-out. But I don't have that trouble with Gilad. Gilad's cues are good so he's easy to follow & you're always ready for the next move...the first time you do one of his videos, you'll be following along no problem. He's got lots of tapes...get moving & try one!",1252713600,12,1082,4.361386138613861
3598626,5,B001GBIOQO,Great to still be able to work out with Gilad since they took him off the TV broadcasts.,1424044800,,88,3.9444444444444446

3598628,5,B001GBIOQO,"Used to watch these all the time on tv. Very much a beginners workout but since I'm short on time before work these fit perfectly into my timeframe. I have noticed that I seem to be losing more weight since I started doing these consistently instead of just abs every morning. This gives you a little bit of everything - cardio, strength training, abs and stretching.",1419379200,4,367,4.575757575757576

3598633,4,B001GBIOQO,"I have been working out with Gilad, off and on, for many years.  He keeps it simple, and I still get the results that I expect.  This DVD is definitely for beginners.  The great thing about having a workout on a DVD is that you can pause it when you need a short break.  The only negative is that sometimes Gilad will instruct you to do several more reps throughout the commercial break.  But, there is no commercial break!  So, if you want to finish your exercises, you have to pause the DVD for a minute.  That can be a little inconvenient. Other than that, this is typical Gilad.  If you have seen him on TV, then you know what to expect here.",1374105600,9,646,4.195121951219512
3598634,3,B001GBIOQO,Gilad is always good but there are only 3 programs on this DVD.  You have to decide if it is worth that.,1361923200,,104,3.727272727272727
3598635,5,B001GBIOQO,"I probably wouldn't have purchased this (and 6 other Gilad DVDs)if I would have realized at the time that ""Bodies in Motion"" is still on TV. I now DVR ""Bodies in Motion"" and ""Body Sculpt"" and work out to these a couple of days a week. BUT I am still glad to have the DVDs and don't mind lending financial support to Gilad's efforts. I worked out with him in the early nineties and he kept me in great shape. I'm so glad to be working out with him again...I'm feeling and looking better already!! THANKS, GILAD!!",1349481600,7,511,4.278350515463917
8304820,4,B001GBIOQO,"LOVE these workout DVDs. I remember when this show was on tv every day, and the workouts are still fun and challenging. If you need a quick workout every day then this is great since they took out the commercial breaks each workout only lasts about 20 minutes. You get a little bit of everything in each workout. Will definitely be looking to buy more.",1512259200,,352,4.430769230769231

8304825,3,B001GBIOQO,"I love Gilad's workout, but I thought I was getting some of the later work outs.  I used to enjoy FIT tv but can't find them any more and these are his earlier.  Good, but hoped there were different than the dvd I already have.",1428883200,,227,4.022222222222222
