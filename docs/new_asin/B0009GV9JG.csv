8060601,4,B0009GV9JG,Bought this for my Grandson who is twelve and he is picking up some things ...it is basic fundamentals to get your fingers coordinated to the finger picking style.

8060602,5,B0009GV9JG,I have used several of Fred's DVDs-this is my favorite-much more info on various finger patterns than the blues disc that is available.  Could last me a year to 'get' the patterns into my hands.,1217116800,4,194,4.542857142857143
