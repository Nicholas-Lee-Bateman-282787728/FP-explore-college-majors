2693195,5,B00006ADDW,"If you are looking to shiver your timbers this halloween time, this is great family movie!!!
The friendship that developes between the young girl, the neighbor, and the ghost is touching.
Even the young brothers add a bit of fun to the mix.
We loved it!!!",1381190400,,255,4.565217391304348
2693196,5,B00006ADDW,"I had not heard much about this movie, but the I knew the leads were good and liked all of Oscar Wilde's stories that I read, so took a chance. The story is surprisingly touching, though it may be a little scary for very young children. NMy fanmily really enjoyed the movie and we look forward to seeing it multiple times.",1379808000,,322,4.295081967213115
2693197,5,B00006ADDW,"Excellent movie.  Patrick Stewart brings a unique and well played perspective to the role.  I enjoyed it very, very much.",1379030400,,121,5.0
2693198,5,B00006ADDW,"This was a birthday gift for our Great Niece in Charlotte, NC. She loves it and invited her friends over to watch it along with her Sister!",1368576000,,139,4.185185185185185
2693199,4,B00006ADDW,This is a classic story in true Oscar Wilde wit and flair.  It's both hautning and funny.  It's a fairy tale for all ages.  In this story a young American girl helps to free the tormented spirit that haunts an old English castle.  It's very well written and a beautiful tale for all ages.  It's too bad this wasn't the best adaptation.,1188172800,2,335,4.338709677419355

2693201,1,B00006ADDW,"It wasn't that it was so scary, but that it was so very poorly done!  The garish Day-Glo coloring clashed drastically with the story, and most of the main characters were drawn without pupils to their eyes.  Then, suddenly, the pupils would appear, then disappear!  To be honest, this is NOT the DVD I thought I had ordered, but because a family member really wanted to see it, we unwrapped and watched it (for the first and last time!)  The story, written by Oscar Wilde, was rather sweet, but because of the quality of the animation, I would NOT recommend ANY video from this company!",1076457600,2,586,4.552380952380952

2693206,5,B00006ADDW,I loved it ----  a great old fashioned ghost story.,1462233600,,51,4.1
2693207,5,B00006ADDW,"As a kid I watched the original so when this came out I watched with my kids who enjoyed it. Now I am introducing my grandkids to it. They enjoy watching it all year long not just at Halloween.
Patrick Staurt does a fantastic job as the lonely ghost.",1461715200,,250,4.122448979591836
2693208,5,B00006ADDW,Great exciting and suspenseful movie! Great actors!,1458864000,,51,6.428571428571429
2693209,4,B00006ADDW,Nice storyline that would make a decent choice for a family night movie.  Definitely geared more toward 9 -15 yr olds then younger children or adults but I liked it just the same.,1452211200,,179,4.424242424242424
2693210,5,B00006ADDW,"Just what I needed to accompany a reading of ""The Canterville Ghost.""",1449446400,,69,4.833333333333333
2693211,2,B00006ADDW,I prefer the the version with John Gielgud and Alyssa Milano as actors because I grew up with that version.,1446595200,,107,4.4
2693212,5,B00006ADDW,"I had seen this on T V some years back and was looking for a copy, so I got it
for my Kindle.  It is a movie that I would call great.  The Story is of a Knight who
wronged his wife and must haunt his home till someone sets him free.",1445817600,,232,3.4423076923076925
2693213,4,B00006ADDW,Comparing this to the 1940's version is very helpful. The story line is followed somewhat but Sir Patrick Stewart's acting makes up for the lack of ability on the part of the actor who played the father. Great movie.,1444867200,,216,4.564102564102564
2693214,4,B00006ADDW,Close to short story.  Better than other choices.,1444435200,,49,5.125

2693218,5,B00006ADDW,"I thought the movie was done very well with an Elizabethan ghost meeting American boys who were never taught to be afraid.  A young girl saves the day.  Fun and impressive with really good actors,",1433894400,,196,4.571428571428571
2693219,5,B00006ADDW,Enchanting and romantic with a touch of supernatural suspense. Love love love! First watched this movie when I was seven. still adore it at 27.,1433635200,,143,4.76
2693220,5,B00006ADDW,"I love this rendition of The Canterville Ghost.  Patrick Stewart does a magnificent job, as does Neve Campbell.  She's as cute as she is when she gets older (see her esp. good acting in The Partition).  It's a wonderful family show, probably more geared to kids, but I enjoyed it thoroughly as an adult, as well.",1430006400,,312,4.535714285714286

2693223,5,B00006ADDW,"Patrick Stewart excels as always, but the other actors are mediocre at best. Nevertheless it is a fun movie to watch",1428364800,,116,4.571428571428571

2693227,2,B00006ADDW,"Couldn't finish it. Pretty boring. Gave it two stars because I like Patrick Stewart, generally. The 1980's version is much better.",1412812800,,130,5.238095238095238
2693228,5,B00006ADDW,This has always been one of my favorite movies. I particuarly enjoyed watching seeing Patrick Stewart as the ghost. He is excellent no matter what he plays in.  I would buy it again.,1412726400,,182,4.515151515151516

8157839,5,B00006ADDW,"I admit I loved this story when I read it, and though it does not follow the book or previous edition of this movie, it is still a great movie. If you like movies that celebrate love and the human spirit, no pun intended, you will love this.",1508025600,,241,4.041666666666667

8157844,4,B00006ADDW,Patrick Stewart shines in this version of the Canterville ghost.,1478044800,,64,5.5
8157845,4,B00006ADDW,Canterville Ghost is a family friendly movie. Reminds me of the after school special that they used to show years ago.,1477353600,,118,4.666666666666667
8157846,3,B00006ADDW,"Not nearly in same caliber as the original with Charles Laughton and Margaret O'Brien,
In fact the story's a bit different, only keeping a few of the same plot points.
It's an okay movie, but not nearly as entertaining as the other.",1477180800,,232,4.5476190476190474
