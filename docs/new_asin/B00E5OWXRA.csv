The speakers are diverse with regard to ethnicity and gender, which is refreshing, and the film excerpts used as examples are relevant.  Further, it's only 75 minutes long, which is perfect for my intro to film class.  It's difficult to find movies that can be shown in their entirety and allow time for discussion.  I would have given it five stars if the film quality were better.  Do they remaster docs like this?  It would be good if they did because this is an excellent teaching tool.",1504828800,,609,4.592592592592593
8601556,5,B00E5OWXRA,I took a chance on this and I was so glad I did. If you're like myself you and curious about the live making process or you woke up I'm the middle of the night with a cool idea but no ode show to make a movie. This movie is for you. Beware it's am older looking film. But the content is time less. if you can get past the non HD look. Which I admit is hard for my spoiled eyes. You will enter a world that will stimulate the movie lover or maker in you. Hope this helps.,1496966400,,470,3.71
8601557,4,B00E5OWXRA,"A really educational film on the history, and different styles of editing and what the intent of it all is.  It is a sort of crash course on the history of motion pictures.  I imagine a film buff like myself will find it much more interesting that many viewers will.  However for the student of films it is darn near must see.",1436313600,,326,4.225806451612903
