8097585,1,B000CCKZ1K,I paid over 15.00 for the movie and it does NOT play. I tried it in 2 different DVD players. I don't have the information to send it back because it was issue thru one of Amazon sellers. When I open it I threw away the package it was sent. If I only knew this would every happen. I know now. I have never had a issue with any thing that I have order since I have my amazon account.,1492387200,,381,3.775
