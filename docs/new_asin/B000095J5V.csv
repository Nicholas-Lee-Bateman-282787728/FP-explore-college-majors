1879561,4,B000095J5V,"This is a good film that tells the story of a young couple that want to be foster parents. The kids they get are challenging to say the least and it has an impact on the relationship of the couple. The nice twist is that the couple is gay and living an excellant life. No clubs, Bars, Drugs or most of the normal Hollywood trappings of gay men ( note: Both men are in great shape and do work out at the gym in the story, so one stereotype is kept.). The fact that the men are gay is not the big issue in the film, it's the way the kids address the new foster parents and the massive issues that come up with the children and the Mother of the children who arrives without calling first. The story is good, the film quality is good and it's a very clean overall movie, except the profane words the little darlings arrive with. It's worth seeing and even worth buying. It's a nice movie to show in mixed company.",1079740800,5,910,4.117977528089888
1879562,5,B000095J5V,"After reading some of the bad reviews about this movie I was afraid to see this, but I took a gamble and rented it anyway out of curiousity and the 2 hot guys on the cover lol and I have to admit Get Your Stuff is a good movie. Such a refreshing film about gay guys and family. Man are those 2 foster kids a hand full.",1077148800,3,318,3.7611940298507465
1879563,5,B000095J5V,"GET YOUR STUFF is one of the better gay movies out there. Phil and Eric are a very attractive gay couple who live in Beverly Hills. They seem to have it all: the looks, the bodies, great jobs, the material things, but they have been longing for something far more meaningful... a baby. They have been waiting to adopt a baby but end up with two foster kids (TJ a 12 year old alcoholic and his younger brother Brian) who have both had a horrible childhood. The couple's social worker keeps telling them they will get their baby, and blackmails them into taking the boys for one night, which turns into many nights, and soon many weeks. Just when things start to get better the childrens mother comes back in to the picture. Phil (who is a family therapist) does everthing he can to keep the kids and yet keep their mother in their life, but while he is busy trying to unite a family his own relationship is falling apart when Eric feels he just can't take being put second any longer. Will Phil be able to save his own relationship and keep the family together? I will not give away the ending, but I will say this is a wonderful gay movie that deals with issues very rarely seen in gay films. Even though the quality of the movie is low budget and these actors are not veteran actors as some reviews have pointed out, the cast did a great job and this is truly a great film that you can watch over and over. I highly encourage anyone who appreciates movies that inspire, make you laugh, make you cry, but most of all that entertain you to check out this great movie called GET YOUR STUFF!",1077148800,10,1588,4.31438127090301
1879564,1,B000095J5V,"Apparently, I can't change some potential viewer's minds about this awful film given the previous ""glowing"" reviews of it, but I can sure try.  This film isn't worth the $2.00 - $4.00 it would cost to rent much less buy.  With the exception of the woman who plays Gloria the case worker, the acting is amateurish and cliche, the writing and plot are tediously simplistic and insulting to anyone who's seen more than a couple of gay-themed films, and the humor is sophomoric. Previous reviewers of Get Your Stuff seem to be ""all a flutter"" that this film breaks new territory in the field of gay foster parenting. Unforunately, much like the current ""ground breaker"" ""Queer as Folk"" it fails on even this flimsy compliment. I'd like to suggest that if you find ""Leave it to Beaver"" or ""Father Knows Best"" as accurate portrayals of families or americans in the 1950's, than this film is right up your alley. Granted, it is a comedy, but this film tends to take itself too seriously at points to simply be  labeled as such. I have a feeling that 5 or 10 years after the subject of gay parenting or gay life in general has been more extensively dealt with, this film will be looked at much like we view the special effects pictures of the 1940's and 50's. They were acceptable for early attempts but generally laughable today.",1075334400,3,1322,4.593220338983051
1879565,3,B000095J5V,"Totally entertaining film. ""Cute"" story! ""Cute"" situations! Funny lines! CUTE actors! Not a ""classic,"" but a worthwhile view.",1054857600,,125,6.0
1879566,3,B000095J5V,"What do you get when you mix a successful gay couple with two foster kids from the streets?  Well, you could get Get Your Stuff, a cute film about the good times and bad times that might happen if you mix the two mismatched ingredients above.  Farce?  No, it never reaches that state, but it is frequently funny.
The story is about Phil (Cameron Watson), a couples counselor and Eric (Anthony Meindl), a lawyer.  The two want to adopt a baby (mostly it seems from the prodding of Eric's mom), and are just approved to be foster parents in the meantime.  Through some coaxing and borderline blackmailing, they agree to take in T.J. and Brian for one night.  That becomes one more night and one more and, well, you get the picture.
The kids are actually decent actors and, at times, out-act the adults.  T.J. (Grady Hutt) is the optimistic one and tries to get his brother to straighten up so they can have a home.  Brian (Blayn Barbosa), on the other hand, is not as accepting and wants nothing to do with Phil and Eric until their case worker, Gloria, talks them into working the couple to make themselves more appealing.
The film deals with all these problems with a light touch -- never wanting to truly offend anyone.  So they are played up for laughs; however, the message still gets through.  In fact, it takes its toll on Eric who wanted nothing more than a baby and not an entire family of problems and promptly leaves in the film's worst scene that includes Phil screaming and pulling a gun out on his clients and doing the same to Eric as he drives off.
But that type of scene is, thankfully, not the norm.  Most of the picture is feel-good and enjoyable.  More so when Kimberly Scott is on the screen.  She plays Gloria with sass, determination and heart.  The movie is made better by her tough love portrayal -- especially the scenes with the kids.  There is one at the beginning of the film where the kids arrive at the house while Phil and Eric are having an anniversary party.  Brian goes for the wine and argues that kids in Europe drink it.  Gloria responds with, ""They can also speak three languages.  When you can speak three languages, then we can talk.""
Get Your Stuff doesn't set the film world on fire, but it is a fun jaunt.  It's something to pass the time in world that touches on reality, but doesn't actually ground itself there.",1054512000,11,2356,4.462616822429907
1879567,5,B000095J5V,"This movie touched me deeply.  The themes of abandonment, codependence, and social (in)appropriateness of alternative relationships and families are universal even though some of the main characters are homosexual.  While this movie is quite funny, it doesn't pull many punches on serious issues.  Some characters may at first appear broadly drawn and stereotypical but the clich&eacute;s melt away to reveal true to life characters, not polite, safe BS.
Not everything is for everyone, but if you can deal with the serious as well as the funny, then I recommend it whole-heartedly.",1053561600,3,582,5.373626373626373
1879568,4,B000095J5V,"I saw this movie as a benefit for our local gay/lesbian film festival a year or two ago, and loved it, so I'm happy it's finally available on DVD.
  The story deals with a gay couple who want a child, and are conned by a social worker into becoming foster parents to two ""at-risk"" boys, one of whom turns out to be homophobic.  Things get complicated when the boys' real mother (a substance-abuser) decides she wants to come back into the picture.
  All things considered, this was a fairly-compelling, often humorous ""feel-good"" piece of gay cinema, achieved with a cast of mostly unknowns.  I think this would be a good addition to anyone's collection.",1052092800,5,654,4.692982456140351
1879569,1,B000095J5V,"Do not rent this movie and please do no buy it!  You will be sorry.  I rented it due to the fact that there are so few ""mainstream"" gay themed movies and I always like to show my support for the genre.  Well, let me tell you, this movie has absolutely NO redeeming qualities.  The acting, script and plot are simply awful!!  In all actuality, it is an embarrassment to the gay community.  If you do decide to buy or rent this title, consider yourself forewarned.  You will regret it!",1051833600,5,483,4.3

1879593,2,B000095J5V,"Okay, I thought this movie might be funny and thoughtful and unique.  This is an interesting premise that isn't terribly overdone or cliche', but it's mostly wasted because the screenplay makes everyone, yes everyone, look like a moron.  Our two gay ""heroes"" only agree to take care of two troubled teens because they are trying to score points with the social worker who places these kids with them (a gay couple) out of desperation.  The troubled kids act like troubled kids, and the gay ""adults"" behave like children.

They are terribly upset, for instance, because they can't have privacy.  Yet they are hoping for an infant to adopt?  Do they think they will have lots of privacy and quiet nights with an infant in the house?

It doesn't matter because the alcoholic prostitute mother eventually moves in and destroys what little sanity is left in the house until ...everything works out perfectly in the end.  Ridiculous.

This film is not the least bit funny or touching, and is actually boring and ridiculous.  The acting is sub-par too.  So, if you're interested in this premise, rent this before you buy.  The highlight of this movie is a scene of the gay couple in Speedos.  'Nuff said.",1122163200,3,1197,4.780487804878049
1879594,4,B000095J5V,"Interesting Story - although somewhat predictable right from the outset.

Dreadful acting!  Every line is strained and self-aware with the two main male characters which is a bit disappointing.  However the support cast (the kids and the welfare worker et al) do tend to have moments of brilliance.  The comparisson makes you wonder why the support cast is so good when the principals are so poor.

Initally this makes the film a little hardto get into.  Eventually I found myself pulled into the story.

Its a nice tale, told many times in many ways.

Would I buy it if i had seen it before?  No.
Would I buy it for a gift?  No.

Strangely compelling even so!",1108252800,4,660,4.555555555555555
1879595,5,B000095J5V,What a refreshing gay movie about family. Some of these negative reviews posted here may lead you to believe this is the worst movie ever made. This is not a bad movie at all. The quality of the film is not good as most low budget films are not. The movie itself is such a wonderful film that deals with family rather than just sex uped hunks who are in to drugs. Get Your Stuff is a great film.,1099094400,9,395,4.012658227848101
1879596,1,B000095J5V,"After reading the reviews written by other people, my only question is ""What movie were they watching"". I will admit that this movie had an interesting concept, but the interesting part stops there. Other than one or two funny lines, the movie runs like a corny after-school special. I did watch the entire movie, hoping it would get better... and it never did... if fact it got worse. If you think you might want to buy this movie, do yourself a favor and rent it first.",1096588800,4,471,4.488372093023256
1879597,4,B000095J5V,"Phil and Eric are a Beverly Hills gay couple who have it all - looks, money, friends, professional success, and a solid relationship. The next step appears to be bringing children into their family, so the couple begins the process of adopting a baby. This process is often a long, drawn out one for prospective parents (especially gay parents), which can lead to frustration. When a child caseworker friend suggests that the men take in a couple of young brothers while waiting for the baby they want, Phil and Eric agree to foster the boys ""just for one night."" As the promised one-night-stay stretches into two nights, then three, then on and on, the two boys reveal themselves to be streetwise, somewhat homophobic, and more than a little interested in the contents of the liquor cabinet. Further complicating matters, the boys are tracked down by their mother, an alcoholic prostitute who lost custody of them. She initially wants to take the boys away from this ""unwholesome"" setting, but after witnessing the benefits of their current living situation firsthand, changes her mind and seeks a permanent place in the arrangement. The resulting stress threatens to tear the couple apart, as one partner develops a soft spot for the boys and their mother, while the other just wants them gone.

 The film is a solid first effort by writer/director Max Mitchell. He deftly touches upon issues including the importance of compromise and communication in a relationship, how to get through difficult stretches without self-destructing, and what it takes to make a family. As a school psychologist, I have worked with children in the foster system, as well as others in broken and highly dysfunctional homes, and the portrayals of the two boys in this film are spot-on. Their behaviors may seem outrageous and unbelievable, but when you look at the abuse and neglect such children go through all their lives, it's easy to understand that their acting out is their attempt to reject adults before they can be rejected themselves. Why would they want to start caring for and counting on another adult when that adult is just going to walk away and leave them behind soon, the way all the others have? I find ""Get Your Stuff"" to be an involving, funny, moving study of those who have a lot but are still missing something, and those who have little and just want a chance in life. If you're interested in a gay film that focuses on exploring family values from a new perspective, this is the film for you.",1091318400,26,2501,4.827505827505828
1879598,1,B000095J5V,"Okay, I'm a social worker, so I kinda judged this movie by this. The guys are really good eye candy and great bods.  But, the situation is so cliched and boring that I keep wondering when they were going to come to their senses. The guy who plays the therapist is VERY cliched and doesn't have his own life grounded in any reality.  It doesn't break any new (...) ground..it just rehashes the old, with kids thrown in.

7989609,2,B000095J5V,"It's ages since I've been so torn in my rating.
Plot in a few words - wealthy gay couple decides to adopt a baby. The waiting list is long, so social worker (Gloria) gives them a chance to become foster parents and leave two boys at their house.
Nothing goes well from the very beginning and arrival of drunk mother of these two only worsen situation.
But this is an american production. So, there must be a happy ending...
And that is one of the reasons I lower my rating. The final part of this film is so sweet that I got tooth-ache:(
Another reason why I am disappointed about the whole story is one particular scene - worth the biggest drama queen in the world. Throwing himself on the hood? With a fake gun in his hand? (so fake, that even kids wouldn't believe that it's a real weapon!). Screaming with pitch voice? Yep, it's our hero, local saviour - Phil. Too much for me.
