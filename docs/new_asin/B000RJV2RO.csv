8201161,4,B000RJV2RO,"Technically rudimentary, and arguably too short, this is still a very enjoyable documentary on the rise of rhythm and blues among struggling young African American musicians before it was co-opted by white artists and re-titled rock and roll.

It focuses both in interviews and (as of 1988 when the film was made) current performance clips of Ruth Brown and Charles Brown (no relation, but obviously friends) recounting their trials and successes in an era when black music was still mostly a stranger to white audiences. Terrific stills,
carefully selected additional interviews with creators, producers and fans, along with and archival footage give a great sense of the wild creative energy and terrors of being a talented black artist in the south in the 1950s.

At only an hour it's difficult to go too far into depth on any issue; the music, racial politics, the business, life on the road. But by focusing primarily on just these two charismatic performers (both great talents who are long admired among fans, but who never really broke through as much as they should have) and their experiences it manages to feel like more rich than a high- speed highlight reel.",1487116800,,1171,4.969387755102041
