7000934,5,B00T6KIQJC,"The series is great, why else would I buy the whole season.

As for the physical collection, what you get is simply all the past seasons DVDs combined into a single holder/package.  It's as if someone bought each individual season DVD and put them into a box.  For me this is fine, for others I know they would like ""complete series"" packages to be unique, to fold or slide out in different ways, so to each their own.

Also some things to note:
- Since these are the individual season, the dvd cases may have that sticky plastic fringe on the outside binding.
- If you're like me your first instinct is to peel off all the clear security tape from the dvd cases.  I resisted this urge.  The dvd cases are stored in a way that you can't tell which season is which.  While the security tape is clearly labeled for each season.  I used an exact-o/razor blade to carefully cut a line through the tape.
- Others may not have this, but I do. The season 1 dvd has all the disks stacked on one another inside the case, like a CD spindle.  All the other seasons have a ""flippable page"" for the disks.",1437004800,64,1092,4.262135922330097

7000937,5,B00T6KIQJC,"This is a wonderful series that was cancelled too soon. A remarkable and thoroughly convincing cast, (despite some improbable aspects of the various complex plots,) great writing and direction, exceptional prop, wardrobe and location work, and outstanding photography featuring the streetscapes and grand interiors of New York City make for a one-of-a-kind viewing experience that stands up to watching multiple times. In fact, the improbabilities make the outcomes even better. During its run on USA, I missed enough of the plot points and back stories of the characters that it's a treat to have them finally filled in. And the extras included in this DVD set prove what is already quite evident onscreen. These actors and production team shared a peculiar chemistry and camaraderie that makes virtually every scene sparkle with wit, intrigue, plot twists, minute details, suspense and affection. A potent combination indeed. I would single out some performances for special mention, but I suspect they might not appreciate the gesture. Buy it.",1433376000,21,1046,5.384146341463414

It's about friendship, loyalty, loves lost, good cops, bad cops, and a criminal justice system that's not always just.  The plot is innovative with many unexpected twists.

The whole series is currently playing on Netflix.

I'd love to see a follow-on series with the same actors.",1496793600,,444,4.701298701298701

7001153,1,B00T6KIQJC,I have been slowly watching these discs and got to season 4 disc 1 and the disc was bad and skipped or froze throughout.  I don't know if I can get it replaced because there is no way to contact the seller but I would give it 5 stars if they will replace the bad disc. Hopefully none of the other discs is problematic.

7001156,5,B00T6KIQJC,"Love the series.  It is very similar to Burn Notice.  Light and merry...no real sex, which is nice for a change.  Sex needs to stay in my bedroom.  I do not need to watch others.  Nobody ever dies nor does it ever get gory.  Entertaining enough that you do not fall asleep and all actors are nice to look at.",1476748800,5,308,4.05

7001168,3,B00T6KIQJC,"I love this collection & I think most of the episodes are intact.  The writing, acting, & direction are stellar,  . . .except whoever put this collection together severely edited the Pilot, probably to shorten it. Too bad.  The Pilot, which came in two episodes was perfectly nuanced, somewhat poetic & absolutely brilliant. Many lines of dialog were edited out.  I guess whoever edited was too close to it to realize what they lost. When you compare it to what is was originally, very disappointing. So glad I kept the Pilot on my TIVO.",1470787200,7,537,4.680851063829787

7001171,2,B00T6KIQJC,"I bought this when Amazon had it as the 'deal of the day'.  No wonder.  They must have had a truck load of them to dump.  We had never seen it before, but took a chance.  Compared to others in our extensive video library, this is pathetic, amateurish acting.  The constant 'whites of their eyes' closeups are distracting, to say the least.  Most of the parts are far over-played.  Plots are OK, but could have been so much better if not for the acting issues.  Sorry to all the actors, but this is just not good video.",1468108800,,518,4.268041237113402

Having also just started watching the new show 'Second Chance', I immediately recognized Tim DeKay who playing a very similar character as an FBI agent.

Haven't had a chance to watch them all yet, will update if there are any problems with any discs.
Not sure if each season was supposed to be shrink-wrapped, none of mine were, but the top security/identifier tape was still intact. An earlier reviewer stated that their S1 differed from the rest in that it was single spindle case, while mine was S5.

8700570,5,B00T6KIQJC,"This is simply the best written show in ages.  It's extremely well acted, and the scripts crackle with outstanding dialogue.  It's reminiscent of Robert Wagner's 'It Takes A Thief,' updating it to the 21st century and making it more of a team effort.  One to watch again and again.",1531267200,,281,4.6938775510204085

8700574,1,B00T6KIQJC,"White Collar complete collection.  Have just finished watching  season 1 and put in the first disc for season 2 - which would not play.  When I removed the disc from my dvd player and inspected the?disc to try to figure out why it would not play, i realized that the disc was bent.  Really disappointed -  very poor quality.  I have already ordered another copy of season 2 and should have it tomorrow.  VERY DISAPOINTED!!",1526601600,,422,4.546666666666667
