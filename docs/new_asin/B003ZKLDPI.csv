4234866,5,B003ZKLDPI,"This 2009 release of the complete Ring, filmed in 2008 in Valencia, Spain under the baton of Zubin Mehta is a compelling, visually arresting, and best of all, well-sung version of Wagner's mythological cycle. It should appeal to Wagnerians who want to hear the next generation of singers, and those curious opera-lovers who want to see what a modern Ring looks like.

This is not a traditional production. It incorporates dance, machinery, and digital projections. These last look fantastic on DVD: a centerpiece of this hyper-visual staging. But behind all the flash and java is a solid retelling of the myths, steered by Mr. Mehta's steady hand in the pit and Carlus Padrissa's innovative (but not intrusive) directorial ideas.

La Fura del Bas is a Catalan theater troupe: kind of an Iberian answer to Cirque de Soleil. Here, their dancers serve as scenery, props, and even buildings, combining to form the gates of Valhalla in an astonishing image that ends Das Rheingold. The other key element of La Fura's staging is a set of eight digital projection monitors, that serve as the mountains, the Rhine river, and the flames as Gtterdmmerung blazes to a close.

The digital projections (by visual artist Franc Aleu) serve as visual reminders throughout the cycle, accompanying Wagner's leitmotiv system of musical memory triggers. Mr. Aleu also incorporates cyberpunk concepts in this Ring. For example, Nibelheim (reached through the caldera of Mount Etna) is depicted as a complex, ever-spinning machine. The sword is a three-dimensional electronic idea, floating in cyberspace before it actually appears in the hand.

The Gibichungs appear as tattooed yakuza gangsters out of a William Gibson novel, more interested in the stock market than the affairs of Gods and Valkyries. Siegfried himself (Lance Ryan) is a grotty club kid with dreads, wolf skins and tattoos before the Gibichungs clean him up and get him a nice suit. Most disturbing is Hagen's call to the vassals: the mention of animal sacrifices to the Gods triggers an ocean of blood that would have pleased Stanley Kubrick.

But it's not all hi-tech. The Rhinemaidens appear in suspended glass aquarium tanks, big enough to swim in with real water. They ""birth"" a collection of golden fish-eggs, which Alberich collects and steals to forge the Ring. The Ring itself looks like the product of Homer Simpson's attempt to make donuts in the reactor core. Brunnhilde's magic fire is a group of dancers with torches. Wotan is accompanied by a ""forest"" of dancers armed with long porcupine-like quills. And Siegfried's corpse is carried out--through the theater itself.

Musically, this is a pretty solid cycle, with a mix of young singers and cagey veterans. Lance Ryan stands at the forefront, a steady Siegfried with a generally pleasing tenor that never shrieks or struggles. Jennifer Wilson is a formidable Brunnhilde, with a voice to match her imposing stage presence. She delivers her best performance in the second act of Gtterdmmerung, making hay in the Vengeance Trio.

Peter Seiffert brings his veteran tenor to Siegmund, and Petra Maria Schnitzer is an ardent Sieglinde. Gerhard Siegel is an exceptional Mime. Juha Uusitalo dives headlong into Wotan, using his big Finnish bass to good effect as the King of the Gods. With his low range and dark tinge, he gets better as the cycle goes on, rising to a mighty climax with ""Wache, Wala!"" in the last act of Siegfried.

It may help Mr. Uusitalo's performance that he shares the stage with Matti Salminen, the king of Finnish basses. Mr. Salminen is in all four operas, playing Fafner, Hunding and Hagen over the course of the cycle. Mr. Salminen's huge instrument may have lost some of its luster, and he sings with some vibrato. But he can still pour on the power and rich black tone, and nobody in the operatic world looks as evil--even when he's just sitting there.",1303689600,18,3888,5.007739938080495
4234867,5,B003ZKLDPI,"A stunning new avant garde production.  Wonderfully sung and visually amazing.  Wagner purists would not agree, but the music is what counts and it's presented in an excellent propduction.",1298246400,4,188,5.448275862068965
4234868,2,B003ZKLDPI,"The idea of using CG effects and acrobats in this Ring is great.  Unfortunately the effects mostly are just a distraction, having nothing to do with the music, and the great moments of the score usually go for nothing.

Mehta's conducting is good.  Indeed it's the best part of this Ring.  The singing ranges from passable to execrable.  One can hardly blame the singers, however, as they have to deal with the most ghastly, ludicrous costuming I've ever seen.  This aspect of the production is nothing short of disgraceful.

My strongest criticism, however, goes to the vision editor of the DVDs.  The lengthiest shot might last for about 4 seconds, and the constant cutting back and forth is infuriating.

A great opportunity, largely wasted.",1297209600,22,744,4.935483870967742
4234869,2,B003ZKLDPI,"I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.
I have the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring from the early 1990's and thought it was time to upgrade to blu-ray with this Valencia Ring Cycle.
There has been enough said about the video aspect of these performances and the singers, but few details about the audio except that it is excellent. I beg to differ. I have listened to all 4 performances once and the Rheingold now twice for this review with the DTS HD-MA track.
The orchestra is recorded fine. The sound stage goes about 2-3 feet beyond the front corner speakers to the left and right. BUT LEFT AND RIGHT ARE REVERSED!
If you listen to the stereo track 2:55 into the recording, the french horns are on the left, where they are actually sitting. When you then listen to it in the surround mode, they come from the right, i.e reversed.
You can hear this also clearly at about 18:15 into the performance. First sings the Rhine maiden in the middle and her voice comes from the center. Then sings the left maiden, but the sound comes from the right. Then sings the right maiden and the voice comes from the left. Never had anything like that.
At 30:49 Wotan is left of Fricka, but Fricka's voice is left of Wotan.
At 38:06 Fricka is on the far right of the stage, voice is from left.
But at 2:08:13 Fasold is on the left, his voice is in the middle.
At 2:14:46 Fasold moved to the right, his voice is now left.
At 2:17:15 Erda appears on the far left of the stage, but the sound comes from the right.
At 2:21:05 Wotan to the right of Erda, his voice is left of her voice.
The reversal of left and right explains most of the anomalies, but not everything. Why not more sound from the right, when they are left.?
Philipp Knop could probably tell us what went wrong. He is given credit for the stereo and surround mix.
With the performance so much utilizing the projections in the background and wide stage shots required for that to work, the misallocation of the voices just ruins this for me. To see Wotan on the right and to hear him from the left is just goofy.
If you watch it on a 32"" screen and your loudspeakers are 36"" apart, you probably won't notice. In my setting, very noticeable.

I listened now a second time to parts of the remaining 3 operas, i.e Walkuere, Siegfried and Goetterdaemmerung
The orchestra in all three operas is recorded rather well with a good soundstage and detail. There is no left/right reversal on these three.
But the voices are not recorded right when you compare them to the actual positioning of the singers on the stage which you see quite often due to the multitude of stage shots. And that holds true for all three performances.
The sound comes mostly from the left of center. If the singers are on the left stage, the sound comes from where they visually are. If they are in the middle, the sound comes from about 2 feet to the left of center. When they are at the right, the sound comes from the center and is more distant.
The only explanation I have is that the right stage microphone did not pick up the sound. So regardless of how far a singer moves to the right, the center microphone will pick up most of the sound. If he is in the middle, the left microphone will pull the sound to the left, as there is no balancing microphone on the right. If the singer is on the left, he sounds ok as the (missing) right component would be rather small relative to left and center mics.
So in the Walkuere's opening scenes, Siegmund and Sieglinde are to the right of center, but sound is from left of center. At about 18:45 Hunding sings Heilig ist mein Herd and he is half left and sounds left. Then he goes to the right of center and sings at 19:07 Ruest uns Maennern das Mahl and the sound is from the left of center.
At around 27:00 Siegmund sings left of center and moves to the left and the sound moves with him further to the left.
Siegfried is the same, as is Goetterdaemmerung. In the opening scene of G. the left norn is heard from the left, the middle one from left of center and the right somewhat more distant from the center. It stays this way all the way to the end.
While the visual effects are at times quite striking and new, opera is for me mostly an audio event. I can listen to an opera without picture, but I can't watch it without sound. The way this is playing out with the disconnect between the stage and the soundstage, I don't think I'll watch this again. It would probably be a stunning production if the sound was right. I'll return my set and stay with Barenboim/Kupfer until there is a proven updated release with top sound.",1296604800,26,4837,4.315384615384615
4234870,5,B003ZKLDPI,"Wagner wrote the libretto of the Ring backwards and the music from the Rheingold forwards. He wrote about his Cycle that ""how can he hope to have his intuitive perceptions understood by others, when he himself stands before an enigma and can suffer the same illusions as anyone else."" (Lee 1994:Limelight editions New York pg 98). He used Germanic and Nordic Myths, added ideas of his own,plus based the concept of a festival on the Ancient Greek ideal. At the time of writing the Libretto, Wagner was under the influence of the Philosopher Feuerbach. ""Polytheistic religions, he argues,express man's dependence on Nature and personify natural forces"".(Oxford 1995:MJL).Man attributes to God his own feelings. We need to replace the love of God for the love of Man and our faith in ourselves. Then Wagner switched his ideas to Schopenhauer. This Philosopher was influenced by Plato, Kant, the Hindu Upanishads and Buddhism. He saw the world as evil and horrible. Will was the cause of Mans problem. If we can lose Will like the Saint who thinks life is an illusion, and we can all become this way, then Will  shall cease to exist. Very much against Wagners way of life, as he loved to consume. This way of thinking did influence his later music in the  Ring. Why, I do not know.  Wagner himself believed in Reincarnation and had read books on Buddhism and Hinduism. He wrote a Sketch for a proposed opera called Die Sieger, based on an incident in Buddhas life. In Parsival Reincarnation is mentioned  in the Libretto regarding Kundry. Father Owen Lee in his marvellous book on the Ring, writes that the Ring is about us. A World of many layers, the Human soul. For me the Ring can be staged in so many ways and then its meaning depends on our own understanding of ourselves. Thus,at the very end of Gotterdammerung, Alberich is still alive, and a lovely theme attributed to Sieglinde, Die Walkure, finishes the opera. This means the start of a new world the critics say. But could it be that Wagner meant, that it is up to Man, to have a peaceful World,or the  basic problems with the Ring would start all over again. A sort of Karma. Feuerbach and Schopenhauer, brought together at the very end, destruction of the Gods,and a new age. According to Ernest Newman in Wagner Nights,how to express it in words finally defeated Wagner. The Man of the Theatre, saw a musical ending, but unconsciously, the practical side realized that leaving Alberich alive,showed us that  humans may not change. If we see this Ring  about us and our spirit, we could see the ending as reaching the peaceful innerself,but with a chance of slipping back into our old ways. We have a choice,constant rebirth,or a new way of thinking.

I have five DVD and two Blu ray Rings. The Levine which I like, with the Italianite sound,which has the Bel Canto Singing of James Morris, the Wotan,Siegfried Jerusalem, the best Siegfried in this Field. The Chereau Ring conducted by Boulez,with Gwyneth Jones as the Brunnhilde, changed the staging of opera, is a favourite of mine. I do like Traditional staging as well as what is termed ""Eurotrash"". Battle lines have been drawn up unfortunately. I think the singers of today are as good as they have ever been. It is a myth to think they are not and always look backwards to the past. I have a huge collection of CD's of Opera singers from 1900's to 1970's.  The Barenboim, I hardly play,although it is good and well beloved by many. The Dutch Ring with its Ring stage and Complementary colours lighting, is up there with the best of the rings. The Orchestra is in the middle of the stage. The conductor Haenchen, uses brisk tempos which I like. The Copenhagen Ring is brilliantly conceived, with one of the Best Wotans in James Johnson, Brunnhilde , Irene Theorin,and Siegfried, Stig Anderson. The conductor Schonwandt uses brisk speeds. The Siegfried love duet is played as it should be, fast. The Walkure is the Best out of the Seven I have got.  The passion generated by Anderson and  Sjoberg, remind me of the 1935 Act I recording of Die Walkure, with Lehmann and Melchior. The Weimar Ring on Blu Ray would be my no 1 , but is ruined by one of the Wotans. The staging is simple and not for the Traditionalists. The conductor Carl St Clair, conducts briskly. This ring flows.

Now to get to the point of this review, the Valencia Ring, conducted By Zubin Mehta, directed by Carlus Padrissa, with the Acrobats of the La Fura dels Baus, which do not really intrude upon the action. The scenery is made up of Panels which are screens for the Video's shown. This is outstanding in Blu ray. For example, in Das Rheingold,Wotan and Loge enter the Earth, via a flying machine, which goes into the Earth down into the bowls of Nibelheim. Machines are making eggs, in which there are babies, which become slaves. Amazing. The Tree in Act 1, changes colours ,green and blue, through to red. Drops leaves. At the Beginning of 'Winterstrume',the moon passes across the tree and remains,with birds flying across the tree. Brunnhilde shoots through space on her crane. She is travelling through time, like the space craft in Kubricks, 2001. Yes all the Gods fly around on cranes which become horses. The Gods above Earth, the rest on Earth. The Earth often has the sun behind it. Take Act three of Siegfried, Wotan seems to be flying over snow topped mountains. Also, the Earth arises out of the ocean and out steps Erda. Spacey. Double WOW. If you liked Avatar,and other Science fiction films you will love this backdrop.

The conducting by Metha is slowish, but most of the time does not seem to be so. He,Barenboim and Abbado, when young,  listened to tapes of Furtwangler. You can see the influence here. The tension, emotion and lyrical side of the score brought to the fore. He has an orchestra of the best young players from around the World, chosen by Conductor, Lorin Maazel. The  physical scenery depicting Valhalla,is made up of acrobats. In Siegfried, the same acrobats with props, become Miro like designs. In Act 1 of the Walkure, the singers are dressed in Prehistoric clothes, the Gods in space like outfits. I cannot see a problem with the clothes they wear, nor with the filming of the opera. Obviously,the critics of this facit of film making do not go to the cinema, and understand that the camera does jump around. I get tired of reading their bleating about this. Opera filming is being treated like new cinema film making.

This is one of the few Rings made where there are no singers who have weaknesses. They are all good. Wotan is a find, Juha Uusitalo,a young bloke,but has a grasp of this difficult part. Brunnhilde, is Jennifer Wilson,already up there with Theorin and Catherine Foster of the Weimar ring. Who said we do not have any Wagner singers today. What a powerful voice , with such depth and emotion. She is built in the traditional Wagnerian mould, big. Sieglinde of Petra  Schnitzer and Siegmund, Peter Seiffert are competent. Both bring their experience to the part.  For the best of Seiffert, hear him as the Kaiser in Richard Strauss ""Die Frau ohne Schatten'-TDK. Anna Larsson as Fricka plays her very well, but is up against Copenhagens Fricka Randi Stene, who is outstanding. The Siegfried of Lance Ryan is lyrical and he actually looks the part. But he is not up to the standard of Jerusalem, who is. I would say he is good as Heinz Kruse of the Dutch Ring, and within touching distance of Anderson . Fasolt is  Matti Salminen, he must be in his late 60's. What a strong voice. Stephen Milling as Fafner. Both walk around in Avatarlike Robots. The rest of the parts all add up to a great Ring, which is worth five stars.

Where does it stand with the other rings. Obviously, better then the Levine and the Barenboim,here many will disagree with me. This is the Ring of the 21st century. I like the Chereau, another all around ring without failings. The Dutch Ring does have failings, but I am very fond of it. The Copenhagen Ring falls in that Catagory, but I would not be without it, the same goes for the Weimar Ring. For me, it is a draw between the great Chereau Ring , Valencia Ring and the Copenhagen Ring. I would suggest first timers obtain the Levine Ring to get their bearings. For young people  order this Ring immediately, I think you will love it. At least I hope you will. This is written by an old geezer, who went through the 1960's and 1970's as an alternative."" Hippies' we were called. Greenies now. I did the whole overland trip twice via India, to Australia, where I now live.

Blu ray is the way to go. Once you have seen the clear picture and heard the sound you will not go back to DVDs. I wish all the Rings I have named were in BLURAY now. I think the companies are missing out here. I have bought a Denon DX 1OOODB Blu ray sound system, with two speakers that creates surround sound. The set  has a place for head phones. I use a Sennheiser Wireless surround sound head phones. Filmed in HD. Zone Worldwide. Dts-HD ma 7.1. Has four bonus films about this ring. Go for it. I think even the traditionalist might like it. Not understanding them I may be totally wrong. Who wants to live in the past. Mahler once said"" Tradition is a form of lazyness."".",1292803200,72,9227,4.616229408175717
4234871,4,B003ZKLDPI,"There's a puzzle here and it is primarily Zubin Mehta. You would expect a fast,rousing performance from him. Yet that's not what we get. What we get is something quite different. I first noticed it in Rheingold where Mime sings about life in the past. Mehta seems to be highlighting this as a little aria in itself. But then in Walkure he allows Seiffert (Siegmund) to hold ""Walse"" an incredibly long time. The love duet has rubato all over the place. And throughout the cycle when there is an opportunity the singer will milk the high note for all it's worth. Even the unwritten hold in Brunnhilde's lament in Act 3 of Walkure which used to be regularly done, but has disappeared as singers and conductors hewed to the score, is here restored.
  Then there are those songs spread thorughout the score. Mehta has highlighted passages which now reveal themselves as old fashioned arias and duets. Consider Siegfried: there's Siegfried's song to freedom, the forging song, the duet between Mime and Alberich in Act 2, and, of course, the love duet. As GB Shaw pointed out by the time we hit Gotterdammerung we are back in the arms of Grand Opera.
 So what gives? Where other conductors focus upon music drama, Mehta highlights all the musical forms embedded in the score. Then it hit me. These guys are playing the Ring as if it were bel canto - beautiful singing first, drama second.
  What's more they are staging and playing the Ring as opera seria - that form of opera popular in the baroque. Opera seria starts with a mythical plot (gods and demons) and tells the story through recitative and arias. The opera is a string of arias held together by recitative. Opera developed from this form into the opera we know today with heightened drama and arias, duets, trios , etc. Could this be the Ring as opera seria?
 Well, look at the staging. The scenery in this Ring is spectacular. You have never seen a Ring like it.  Opera seria also provided wonderful scenery. It also would include a deus ex machine - a god appearing with the help of a machine. And, lo and behold, in this Ring all the gods are ex machine. They sing from their perches high above the stage in cherry pickers. These people are saying that when Wagner invented his new music drama he was really going back to the early days of opera seria. For me, Mehta has made his case. I will hear the Ring differently from now on.
 But what kind of experience does this give us? For one thing it does make beautiful singing the goal. But at what price drama? All these gods flitting around emphasizes the four groups of inhabitants of this world - gods, giants, dwarfs and humans. But there can be little interaction from people trapped in a machine. All the poor gods can do in their getups is stand and deliver. And that is just what opera seria was about.
 I was growing uneasy with what I thought was Mehta's lack of drama, especially in Walkure. I approached Siegfried with some trepidation. But then Lance Ryan (Siegfried) came on stage and I gasped - he actually looks the part - young, handsome, athletic. But when he began to sing I was even more blown away. He could sing it, not adequately, but the best I've ever heard. I couldn't wait for the forging scene and that love duet. For him alone this Ring must be recommended. The other two main characters: Uusitalo (Wotan) and Wilson (Brunnhilde) are also singers rather than barkers. And what a joy to have Matti Salmonen as Fasolt, Hunding and Hagen. He is magnificent in both voice and acting.
 There are two great drawbacks to this Ring, however. The costumes are downright ugly. And they create ugly people. Everyone except Brunnhilde is having the worst bad hair day in history. But then the Walkure costume has a helmet that resembles a horse's bridle. Echhh! She has a horse; she is not a horse. Besides the costumes are so heavy and bulky it is hard to really act. Again the characters are forced to stand and deliver.
 And finally the video.  Erich Korngold once said of movie music that it must be so good that the audience is unaware of it. It should not call attention to itself. The same could be said for video direction. The major gaff occurs at the beginning of Rheingold. First we are looking at an image of a bouncing red ball. But then we cut from the ball to the orchestra. And so throughout the prelude we bounce back from stage to pit. At Bayreuth Wagner covered the orchestra. It is heard and not seen. But our director here jumps into the orchestra pit given half the chance.
 There is a real mess at the end of scene 3 of Rheingold. When Wotan and Loge go to seize Alberich we cut from the stage to the pit. What's that about? Was there some trouble with the staging? Was it just sheer stupidity? For a production like this you would think they could do a retake to get it right. Not so.
 Throughout the cycle the camera is always jumping from shot to shot. It can be quite distracting. And there are not a lot of closeups. But then again given the lack of acting that may not be a problem.
 So should you get this Ring? Yes,for Ryan and the other singers. Or wait for him in another production. He is young and still has to perfect his performance. His ""Gotterdammerung"" Siegfried is not quite up to the ""Siegfried"". Yes,for the production. But that's qualified by ugly costumes and stupid video direction. Definitely, this should not be a first
Ring. And it won't be a Ring to which I will return except to see and hear that glorious Siegfried. To see the real drama of the Ring watch Kupher/Barenboim or Chereau/Boulez. For a stunning re-interpretation watch the Copenhagen Ring.",1291075200,47,5628,4.525590551181103
4234872,5,B003ZKLDPI,"The greatest masterpiece in Western art has found a continuously fascinating set of producers.  I say ""set"" because, apart from the hypnotic music, so many good things are contributed by so many imaginative individual singers and groups of singers/performers/set designers/ conceivers, down to the lowliest stagehand.  Maybe you think the RING is something that should look like how Wagner wanted it to look.  But that's ridiculous and pedestrian.  In 1876, the technology was insufficient to encompass the visionary aspect of this music drama.  Heck, Wagner had to build a whole new kind of House for it to be performed in.  In this production (as in any) there are points  that might have been more richly realized for my expectations, but if I had it in me to create a perfect RING, I would.  And, as a theatrical experience, this RING has now become my favorite.  (The Met's new production is brilliant too, but it's not yet available for home viewing).

Look, this is hard music to sing.  I don't give a damn that Brynhide's a little on the heavy side.  She's got a big voice, and the production (visuals, costumes, ingenious pyrotechnics), justifies her.  She's admittedly not a great singing actress, but she IS a PRESENCE.  All the singers perform so admirably that, as I think Wagner intended, you are not left with an opera to judge whether you like or not; you are left with a complete and fully formed vision of the western world's greatest work of art.  I want to capitalize ""art"" here, but I also want you to believe me.  It is, after all, ARTificial.  As it must be.  I don't know what word to use beyond music-drama even to come close to describing the phenomenon of the RING.  Wagner, despicable and unpleasant as he appears to have been, had this in him.  No one artist has ever come close to creating such an all encompassing and visionary work.  I don't even think Wagner realized the full potential of this music.  Especially since the grandsons began their task of ""de-nazifying"" it.  I don't know where Wagner found it in the infinite world of imagination.  It is truly a ""gesamptkunstwerk"" because every generation, or even every 10 or so years, something entirely new emerges from the score.  If you believe that the RING should be ""traditional""; that is, according to the way Wagner might have imagined it, you will be disappointed.  Even a theatrical/musical genius such as he was still bound by his time in history.  If you understand that some works of art are ENDLESSLY capable of being re-imagined, this production will give you something to treasure.  Blu-ray was created for visual and musical art like this.  Not that there is any other.  On a personal note, I've been very ill lately, and depressed.  This set gave me 16-17 hours of pure joy.  And BTW, to the reviewer who completely overstated Brynhilde's size:  get over it.  This is opera, after all, and sometimes it takes a big instrument to sing such an enormous role.  Compare her to Stephanie Blythe or any of a number of Wagnerian sopranos over the last century.  Nowhere does Wagner indicate that she is supposed to be slender.  She's supposed to be POWERFUL.  And that is exactly what she is in 3 of the 4 operas in this enormous work of art.  The best surprise was Zubin Metha, who is not my favorite conductor.  He got it DOWN this time though.  At $116 and change, this is a bargain.  (The Metropolitan Opera Store - in NYC- was charging $40 per opera.)  If you are open to the infinite versatility of this ""total-artwork"" you've got to see this.  If you can do it other than by buying it, either complete, or one at a time, I highly recommend the experience.  Amazon's price is worth every penny.",1335830400,9,3696,4.679626749611198
4234873,4,B003ZKLDPI,"I received this as a gift from my wife. This is a weird Ring. The stage is original and very dynamic, but the voices could be MUCH better. Zubin Mehta is great and it is amazing he's not going as fast as expected from him...The conductor is quite good, the singers are just right...Brunhilde should follow a diet (LOL). Siegfried is weak, Wotan is quite good. The stage is a kind of Star Wars mixed with a nightmare. On Blu Ray this is rather impressive. I enjoyed very much watching it! I had already 2 other versions: James Levine (very traditional) and Daniel Barenboim (less traditional and a master's baton), singers are awesome in both cases...By the way, Siegfried Jerusalem is Siegfired in both versions. Mehta maybe didn't have enough budget to hire good singers, he spent a lot of money paying a wonderful stage. Up to you.
In all cases, Richard Wagner would be proud of all of it. My wife describes herself as a book worm...I describe myself as a MUSIC worm...

I would love to actually see the stage production. It seems like there are really interesting things going on with the set and the acrobats. We will never know besides glimpses because the director/editor of the video shoot are apparently afraid of wide shots. Instead we are treated to close up after close up of an acrobats butt or crotch as they try to manuever into position for the next set piece. I don't want to leave out all of the close ups of Siefried's elbow or the back of Wotan's head or Siefried's belly. My wife, who has worked as a director, editor and producer, is convinced that the video director must have had a fight with the stage director and that is why he chose to destroy the visuals for the Blu-Ray release.

Her singing is great, no doubt. I think if this was a CD audio, I would give 5 stars for her performance. But this being blu-ray, with elaborate visual spectacles with segway, human pendulum, etc, I believe the soprano who is playing a beautiful Valkyrie needs to be also visually convincing.",1327968000,5,501,4.825581395348837

The first thing to say here is modernity. That is the reason why opinions are so different on this page: all the way from 1 through 5 stars. My advice: if you are looking for a traditional staging of Wagner's operas (a tree must be a tree, a mountain must be a mountain, etc) Valencia's Ring is not made for you, choose another one. Staging of the four operas is ultramodern, and it may disgusting to traditional viewers. Once said, if you are a Wagner fan looking for something else or just an open minded person, go for it. It'll provide hours of enjoyment.

What is new on this Ring? Honestly, everything. I am an opera goer and a Wagner fanatic, and I was so impressed when I saw the Rheingold that I could barely sleep that night. Needless to say that on the remaining three nights I was absolutely stucked to the chair. The use of up-to-date techologies along with the human sculptures is simply amazing; lighting is impeccable; actors' movements on the stage are perfectly studied; 3D projections are awesome... And Wagner's instructions are however respected, though with a XXI century perspective. It should be said that some of the artifacts used on the production were inspired on those used during the first Ring Cycle at Bayreuth, in 1876, with Wagner alive, i.e., the ""charts"" the valkyries used in Walkre. At the end, the production is much more respectful that one could think at first. There is no contradiction at all between sung words and events on scene. I think Wagner would have approved this staging; at the end he was an artist, and a team of artists have created this impressive show.

What about orchestra, conductor and soloists? Well, the orchestra, as another reviewer has said, has been picked up by Maazel and taylor made to fit his taste. It may seem exaggerated, but I find that only the Wiener Staatsoper Orchestra provides such a luxury when playing. Sorry about that, but I have attended operas in New York (last time only a few days ago), Berlin, Madrid, etc, and I can't find the same sound. They are from another galaxy. Mehta is a very well known conductor, with ups and downs. Luckily he gave an extraordinary reading of the scores, slow, pure, furtwaengler-styled, with light textures, crystal sound and a wide range of dynamics... Extraordinary.

Singers are all very good and some excellent. No need to go to the details, but all the main roles are very well served (Brnnhilde, Siegfried, Wotan, Siegmund, Sieglinde, Fricka, Hunding, Alberich, the giants, Hagen, Gnther, Gutrune...) as are the secondary. No flaws whatsoever.

All in all, a Ring to be enjoyed, modern in the best sense of the word. To me it looks like the production my grandsons could have attended in 2085, almost a century before... The future of opera in your hands, right now.",1325894400,6,3022,4.781609195402299
4234877,1,B003ZKLDPI,"I bought this Ring set with extremely high expectations.  The orchestral playing and singing are wonderful.  However, as mentioned by R. Kreutzer in another review, the sound recording and disc authoring has been botched.  Channels were reversed, and singers' positions on stage did not correspond to the location of the sound coming from the speakers.  I wrote C-Major Entertainment (the distributors of the set) and described the problems.  I received a reply that they acknowledged the error in the discs, but I got no offer of a replacement when a corrected set was reprinted.  The communication from them bordered on being rude.  If C-Major wanted to develop a loyal customer base, they would have taken my name (and those of other dissatisfied buyers) and sent a corrected set as soon as possible.  I returned the set to the Amazon seller and received a refund in a prompt and courteous manner.  Regardless of the quality of this performance, I will hesitate to buy any more products from C-Major in the future because of their lack of interest in customer satisfaction.  I'm sad and surprised that a newer company to Blu-ray would be so callous to their customer.

I will add that all my dealings with Amazon and their seller were handled professionally and promptly.  I'm truly sorry to enter such a poor review of this set, considering the wonderful playing and singing contained within.",1311897600,22,1396,4.944206008583691

Cor de la Generalitat Valenciana/Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana
Conductor: Zubin Mehta; Production: La Fura dels Baus, stage director Carlus Padrissa
2007-2009

Each of the four operas gets an extra feature on its DVD. We mostly hear from members of the production team, but also from the conductor, some of the singers, and intendant Helga Schmidt in the happy days before her legal difficulties. These extras yield little surprising information and are repetitious, with a lot of the same interview footage reused. I heard twice, for example, Zubin Mehta's story of the first time he heard the RING performed, and how he had been working toward conducting it ever since. The most interesting fact I got out of a cumulative two hours of extras was from the stage director: this was the first integral RING to be performed in Spain. The fledgling Valencia organization, with its striking Calatrava-designed theater, did within its first five years of existence what its older siblings, the Teatro Real and the Gran Liceu Barcelona, never had done. This RING was initially staged between 2007 and 2009, and Valencia's first opera production had been only one year earlier, a 2006 FIDELIO (also with Mehta, also on DVD).

The hard work that Zubin Mehta and this (figuratively and literally) young orchestra put into the preparation is evident in the sound they make together. That is the highest tribute that can be paid Mehta here -- it is very impressive music-making just at the level of the sound, for a group that hadn't been playing anything together for very long and was undertaking its first complete RING. Mehta is an unusual conductor in that he prefers a placement of the basses in the center of the orchestra pit rather than to one side. Even with the mediation of microphones for a recording, this placement affects the balances and gives an audible result of greater weightiness and depth, with more clarity at the bottom but also at the top (as the basses' usual neighbors are not sharing space with them). So, it all *sounds* wonderful. Such reservations as I have on the orchestral level are about the way it moves, or doesn't.

The elements of this cycle, musical and theatrical, only come into proper balance at the halfway point. RHEINGOLD is by far the weakest link. Mehta throughout the cycle is even pokier than James Levine on the Met's 1989-90 video cycle. He's a little slower than Levine in every opera except the last, where they are almost identical. This very deliberate approach hurts the continuity of RHEINGOLD most of all, and scenes droop terribly there. Minutes ticked by and I found myself thinking, ""We're still on this?"" SIEGFRIED and GTTERDMMERUNG are more accommodating of the monumentalized, ""grand"" approach Mehta wants to take to the whole thing. I have a good idea of what Mehta's influences are in this music, and I expect they're the same as Levine's. But I don't think either Levine or Mehta has the gift for keeping Wagner's music buoyant over very slow expanses. Knappertsbusch had that gift, and others of his generation did.

MVP of La Fura dels Baus's production team is Franc Aleu, whose video productions would merit a thousand words all by themselves. They are innovative and beautiful, in richly saturated colors, and they range from extremely realistic (snow-covered mountains as Wotan seeks out Erda) to abstract and suggestive. But they always draw the eye. Several times, I was struck by the realization that for all the visual stimulation going on, I was really looking at a nearly empty stage, which could be cleared with economy. There are few props. What isn't handled by the projections is handled by the acrobatic troupe, who are called on to embody everything from Valhalla's gate, to the stacks of gold, to grass by a river, to Brnnhilde's bed cover (I'm not kidding).

The eye is especially grateful for the work of Aleu and the acrobatic troupe, as Chu Uroz's parodic costumes flatter no member of this cast. Hunding and the Wlsungs (both the parents and their child, before the Gibichungs give Siegfried a makeover) get the worst of it. They sport the dreadlocks, tribal tattoos, and ratty animal skins that were all over opera stagings in the aughts as shorthand for either ""primitive"" or ""post-apocalyptic."" But almost everyone is wearing something exaggerated and ugly, even the gods.

Like the conducting, the stage direction improves halfway through the cycle -- which is to say there is more evidence that some was happening. The gods in the earlier installments are strapped into wheeled cages on cranes, so the singers are several meters above the stage and standing on narrow platforms. This restricts the blocking to a sort of ""balance and deliver,"" and singers cannot get very close to each other. The giants in RHEINGOLD are encased in huge metal exoskeletons and look like Transformers, and Milling can barely graze Salminen with his metal arm in order to administer what we have to accept as the ""death blow."" Once the gods are, for the most part, out of the picture, the direction gets more dynamic, and I like a lot of the choices in the final two installments.

Carlus Padrissa's ideas about Wagner's work seem closest to Harry Kupfer's, of the others I have seen. Like the humans in the Kupfer cycle, the ones here go from primitive to more civilized, and the surroundings change with them. As mentioned above, the Gibichungs give Siegfried a makeover, putting him in a modern suit and giving him a haircut, as if taming Tarzan, and we have the sense that our hero is getting further away from himself and his roots. This fits with the overall concept throughout the RING of nature being violated.

I won't get into everything I found well directed, but I liked that the Gunther/Siegfried bond is taken very seriously here. When Siegfried's memory returns to him, he seems truly sorrowful and he runs to Gunther for comfort and, perhaps, forgiveness. Gunther frantically motions to Hagen as if trying to call off the spear in the back, but of course it's too late. The Wotan/Erda scene one opera earlier is interestingly done too (Erda really *reacts* this time to what she hears, rather than seeming glazed over), and so is the always-ugly scene with the disguised Siegfried's conquest of Brnnhilde. She remains feisty and resentful to the last.

The cast members range from very good to acceptable. If you saw this RING live in 2007-09, at the Met or Bayreuth or anywhere, you'd go away happy. Wilson's Brnnhilde is one of the most powerfully sung on DVD; hers is a kind of voice you just don't hear much anymore. Everyone with whom she shares significant stage time sounds to be giving away vocal size to her. Some viewers have claimed Wilson is stolid and apathetic on stage, but I think they're letting her size (and her very unflattering and limiting costumes) influence them. I see real joy in performing from her, and even a hint of sexiness when Brnnhilde and Siegfried approach each other to do the deed during the playout of SIEGFRIED's final duet.

Ryan's Siegfried is promising. He has a fresh and young sound and he's appealing to hear and watch, but he sounds worryingly light and monochromatic to me, and his interpretation is still in early days. Uusitalo's Wotan is handsomely sung, not the most profound or mercurial. The Wlsungs, a real husband-and-wife pair, give deeply felt performances that make up for some vocal wear and tear.

Larsson is just about perfect as Fricka; she doesn't yield much to any of the more famous ones I've heard. Kapellmann gets by as Alberich more on knowhow than on his now-frayed voice, but his ""brother,"" Siegel, is again a first-class Mime. Both giants, Milling and Salminen, are excellent, and the latter's old-pro triple act (extending to his familiar roles of Hunding and Hagen) comes off much better than I was expecting. He's a real asset here. It is a shame Mayer's RHEINGOLD Erda was not retained. Wyn-Rogers acts the longer version in SIEGFRIED sensitively but sounds vocally out of her comfort zone. Matos, a dramatic soprano who shortly thereafter would wow Met audiences as Minnie, is amusingly ""underparted"" as Gutrune. She sounds more capable of throwing down with this Brnnhilde than anyone else in the cycle, and her attempts to scale down a big sound for Gutrune's wispier lines are uneasy.

This does not challenge the classic Kupfer/Barenboim and Chreau/Boulez Bayreuth video cycles among my favorites, but it gets better as it goes along, it's very impressive to look at, and it has things I will be glad to revisit. I would recommend it if someone wants a razzle-dazzle visual-splendor RING (on that level, it obliterates the Met's 2010-12 creaking cash sink) and is interested in the singers of its major roles.",1453939200,,9747,5.081875
8410565,5,B003ZKLDPI,"This is a wonderful version of one of great works of Western art.  It's not for the faint of heart and certainly should not be one's only recorded version of Wagner's masterpiece, but I loved this and would recommend it to virtually all fans of The Ring.  The singing and the orchestral playing are both first rate, and the high tech staging is spectacular.  I realize that some purists will  prefer a great singer from the past, say a Flagstad or a Melchior, in one or another role, but that is potentially true of all opera performances.  I also realize that some lovers of The Ring will object to the staging. I respect those holding such views and warn them that this is probably not for them. However, for those who love Wagner and for those who want to see what is possible with avant-garde stage production, this set is highly recommended.",1449792000,,846,4.5394736842105265
8410566,3,B003ZKLDPI,"I can't agree with reviewers who are impressed with the visuals and staging of this Ring.  First, they are badly executed.  Loge riding on a Segway while singing.  Albrech suspended by eight thick wires two feet above the stage while film is played on a back screen to give the appearance of flying. Second, the conception of the visuals looks like a 12 year old boy reading too many Marvel comics.
I'm not expecting Lord of the Rings CGI effects, but this is about 1972 Doctor Who, well, not even that good.  I think a sci-fi staging is possible.  It should have been done with solid stationary backdrops and fixed pedestals, IMO.  Put the money into quality art work instead of the gimmicks.
The effects are a distraction from the singing, and in Das Rheingold, the voices often do not project well, whether that is the singing or mic-ing.  Hopefully, there is better ahead.  Still, even a cheesy, not fantastically sung Ring is still worth watching.  Did I mention the orchestral playing is excellent.",1435190400,,1004,4.724137931034483
8410567,4,B003ZKLDPI,"I'm glad I got to see this Ring live in Valencia back in 2009. Despite Metha's indifferent pacing, Carlus Padrissa's staging, both modern and very much in the spirit of Wagner's immense vision and the excitement of the ""discovery"" of a young Canadian tenor who could deliver a musically and visually credible Siegfried made for a very enjoyable vacation. Days of basking in the warm Mediterranean, hearty paellas at noon and going to the Ring in a theater that looked like the Space Station. A Wagnerian paradise.

2014. Bayreuth. Lance Ryan, Valencia's young Siegfried reprises the role he's been repeating over and over for the last six years. The vibrant, steely timbre is gone, replaced by a strange, unpleasant croaking for two painful 5-hour spans, cloaked in the embarrassing ""production"" by Frank Castorf. A study in hatred for Wagner, the audience and elementary decency. Back to Valencia: the exotic white tiles that gave the Reina Sofa opera house its gleaming, streamlined look have been falling off the building's concrete faade, turning it into a sad ruin, looking much like the rotting remains of a beached whale. A bankrupt city has left the damage stand as is. Another poorly conceived vanity project by the then ""hot"" architect Santiago Calatrava and spending-crazed public authorities with little regard of quality control and practical sense. Vocal and architectural decline mirroring each other... Outrageous!

Get this blu-ray as a souvenir of something that time has not spared. Jennifer Wilson's Brnnhilde's is a worthy match to Ryan's Siegfried and Uusitalo's Wotan. La Fura's fantastic acrobatics, always at the service of the drama, provide stunning visual commentary and the breathtaking video backgrounds are vividly captured in HD.

At least the production lives on: After the complete Padrissa/Fura cycle had been reprised in Italy, Rheingold premiered in Houston this year, with the complete cycle promised for 2020. Worth catching as well.",1432771200,,1972,5.293929712460064
8410568,2,B003ZKLDPI,"I was intrigued by the cover photo, but this has been a rather huge disappointment for me.  The singing and the orchestra under the direction of Mehta are good although I found Mehta's tempo generally slow.  Some singers are clearly not typical Wagnerian singers as they have more lyrical vocal tones.  I feel bad for those singers who were intentionally put into the most awkward positions while they sing in this production.

What I don't understand and like is the whole regietheater production.  I am not sure if the director actually know too much about the whole story or just focused too much on symbolism instead of presenting the drama.  While all the aerial acrobatics and use of computer generated graphics are visually stunning, they add no artistic value to the production.  There is general dissonance between what is presented musically and what is presented visually.  The whole production is just a visual spectacle with sound track provided by Wagner.",1421020800,4,969,5.0125

8410572,5,B003ZKLDPI,"This production, directed by Carlus Padrissa, is being hailed as a ""Ring for the 21st century,"" and if it's a bit too early to make claims about the zeitgeist of the century, it's not too early to suggest that this Valencia Ring--like those by Chreau, Schenk, and Kupfer--is a statement to be reckoned with, a production against which others will be judged. Most immediately obvious is the sheer spectacle, topped off by (but not limited to) the often acrobatic participation of the Catalan theater group La Fura dels Baus and by Franc Aleu's video projections, rightly described as ""stunning"" by Andrew Quint in his review of these two operas in the last issue (Fanfare 33:5). Quint has already mentioned a number of the highpoints. I'll just echo his enthusiasm, adding that while some might find the production a touch hyperactive, at least there's not a moment in the hours and hours of viewing here that's less than visually compelling--something rarely said about even the best productions of The Ring.

Granted, it didn't take Anna Russell to point out the streak of inanity that underlies these operas; as Tolstoy's skewering of The Ring in What Is Art reminds us, the Ring's inherent silliness has been a target for critics and comedians since the days when this was New Music par excellence. And this production has its Monty Pythonesque moments, too, especially (as Quint pointed out) in the costumes. But the moments of sheer wonder--the grimy industrial backdrop of Niebelheim, the airborne acrobats who create Valhalla, the kaleidoscopic tree in the first act of Walkre--more than compensate, at least on Blu-ray, where they emerge with astonishing clarity.

For all the razzle-dazzle, though, this is a profoundly human Ring, and the production is even more gripping for its dramatic interpretation than for its spectacle. I use the word ""interpretation""--rather than ""reconception"" or ""vision""--advisedly. Many critics (including me) have registered their distress over the current wave of productions that are driven by the idiosyncratic visions of the stage directors at the expense of the details of the scores. (For a few examples of my own protests, see my reviews of Calixto Bieito's Wozzeck [31:6] or Robert Lepage's Rake's Progress [33:4]). In fact, many of us have complained with such consistency and vehemence that it might seem that we're opposed to creative imagination altogether. We're not (at least, I'm not); respect does not at all require repetition of old tropes, just as freshness doesn't require grinding the composer's intentions under your heel. It's possible to be radical and respectful at the same time, and the Valencia Ring proves it. Archeological rather than disruptive, these discs deepen our understanding of Wagner rather than overturn it.

Two examples can stand for many. First, the treatment of Fricka. Fricka is usually cast as an aging frump. As a consequence, her defense of marriage seems more pragmatic than principled; she seems to be insisting on marital fidelity because, sexually speaking, marriage is all that she can now depend on. Anna Larsson, looking a lot more like Catherine Zeta-Jones in Chicago than Christa Ludwig in the Schenk/Levine/Met Ring, is a very different kind of Fricka. She's smart and sexy, with a voice that can stand up to her husband's and with just a hint of the dominatrix--her principles obviously don't stem from sexual weakness. Her relationship with Wotan thus becomes deeper, her position harder to brush off--and act II of Walkre becomes even more heartbreaking than usual.

Second, the treatment of Sieglinde. Many productions portray Sieglinde as a generous and gracious hostess--even a regal one, as Jessye Norman is in the Met version. Hunding may not be the best of husbands, but at least, it seems, he's given her middle-class comforts. In Chreau's version, in fact, he's given her something even classier than that. But is that really what's in the score and the libretto? Let's remember that Sieglinde was brutally kidnapped and--not to put too fine a point on it--turned into Hunding's sex slave. That history of sexual violence is never occluded in this tough-minded probing of Walkre's first act. When we first see her, she's outdoors, tied up like the dog she's been reduced to, scuttling among the bones outside the dwelling. Her initial scoping out of Siegmund involves not only sight (this production is especially sensitive to the psychology of the look, especially when characters are silent) but smell, too, as she sniffs him to come to terms with what's happening. And we see the growing love between the twins not simply in the growing erotic charge, but--even more touchingly--in the way Sieglinde (and Siegmund too, although to a lesser extent) becomes humanized in the course of the act. It's not just the big gestures; the small gestures, too, reinforce this strange tenderness of the previously uncivilized. Note, for instance, how she gives the prostrate Siegmund water by dipping her hair in a bowl and then transferring it to his lips.

It doesn't hurt that Peter Seiffert and Petra Maria Schnitzer as Siegmund and Sieglinde are both in exceptional voice. Especially powerful, to my ears, is Schnitzer's mad scene in act II, where her sense of grief threatens to undo all her progress and return her to an animal existence. But then again, nearly everyone sings and acts well in this production. As Quint suggested, Juha Uusitalo is as poignant a Wotan as any around today--and Jennifer Wilson manages to convey Brnnhilde's growing wisdom with remarkable sensitivity. Matti Salminen is such a sympathetic Fasolt that it's something of a shock to see how raw his Hunding is.

Zubin Mehta's conducting is slightly on the broad side, rarely pushing the tempos, and concentrating on the long lines. He occasionally slights details (I'd like more bite on the trip down to Niebelheim), but he never loses his grip on the larger architecture. The youthful orchestra plays with tremendous heft and panache, clearly enjoying every minute (something you can't always say for Boulez's Bayreuth crew). As far as audio goes, the 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is suitably overwhelming and enveloping. Enthusiastically endorsed. Peter J. Rabinowitz",1370822400,10,6250,5.152709359605911
