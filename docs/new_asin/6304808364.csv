8156749,4,6304808364,"Super Brawl 2 was on October 11, 1996 and it was better than the first one. Still using the three tournaments for three weight classes from the first Super Brawl proved fair and interesting fights.
In the lightweight tournament is Super Brawl 1 lightweight tournament champion Jay R. Palmer, and rookie fighters in Maurice Corty, Llewelyn Poomaihealani, Brian Gassaway. This tournament has some great submissions and great knockouts.
In the middleweight tournament is Super Brawl 1 veteran Jesse Matilla and rookie fighters in David Paaluhi and Katsuhisa Fujii. This tournament is not as great as the lightweight or heavyweight, but the finals are good.
In the heavyweight tournament are UFC 4, 5 and Universal Vale Tudo Fighting 2 veteran Joe Charles, Lion's Den fighter and 1996 Pancrase Neo Blood tournament veteran Pete Williams and rookie fighter in Donald de la Cruz and Wes Gassaway. This tournament has some good fights but the finals were better.
Also in the tape is a Muay Thai kickboxing fight between Danny Steele and Melchor Menor. I honestly did not care about this since the only kickboxing I like is the K-1 promotion in Japan.
The only draw back is that the Vitor Belfort vs. Jon Hess match is not on the tape for some reason. But footage of the match is on UFC 12 Judgement Day. Overall good tape but with flaws.",995760000,,1330,4.837719298245614
