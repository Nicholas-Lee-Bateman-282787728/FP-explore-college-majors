One of my favorite 80's shows that I grew up with. They just don't make tv like that anymore.",1250812800,2,340,3.927536231884058

3873858,5,B0028S110K,"Can't believe that Season Three is coming out!! Have waited for years for Season Two to come out. Now hopefully all of the other season will come out. Have watched them when they were on TV, now I can watch them on DVD all the time!! Good Show!!",1243209600,4,245,4.125
3873859,5,B0028S110K,"Like the rest of the reviewers, I grew up on Simon and Simon. Loved watching it. The characters of Rick and AJ were terrific and loved the supporting cast Mom Simon, Downtown Brown, Myron Fowler and Janet Fowler. Would have loved to have a dog like Marlow.  Even now when I hear the theme music it brings a smile to my face cause I know good television is fixing to hit the screen from my dvd player.  So Amazon how bout you joining the rest of us and get seasons 4 - 9 released? I'll buy em!  I would rather spend 35.00-40.00 dollars on good television entertainment than watch the majority of tv. shows today.",1243123200,22,611,4.2956521739130435
3873860,5,B0028S110K,Thanks to Shout for bringing season three! I remember growing up watching Simon&Simon after Magnum PI.I agree season three is one of the best. Tomothy Ried ads his talent as downtown Brown and the series really picked up momentum after that. I hope the entire series is released. Also i agree the TV movie from 1995 would be a great addition to the final season! Thank You SHOUT!,1243123200,2,379,4.588235294117647
3873861,5,B0028S110K,"I wish to echo what the other reviewers have said.  This season is when Simon and Simon really hit its stride.  The first two season are good, but this season we meet Downtown Brown, their buddy on the police force.  After this the series really took off.  Thank you Shout Factory for releasing another season of this great series.  Please release all the seasons.  A great extra for the final season would be to add on the one TV movie that came out a few years after the series ended.",1242432000,5,486,4.344444444444444
3873862,5,B0028S110K,"Season 3 of Simon & Simon is where the show really hit it's stride. 1983 was a great year and this show captures the time perfectly. For fans of the 80s, don't forget you get the added bonus of a Whiz Kids crossover episode (starring Matthew Laborteaux etc).

All that and the assurance that Shout Factory will do yet another stellar job on great dvd quality and artwork! Perfect summer viewing and perfect nostalgia.",1242345600,15,417,4.635135135135135
3873863,4,B0028S110K,"I'm glad to hear that SIMON & SIMON's 1983-84 Season is finally being released this Summer since SIMON & SIMON's 3rd Season is even more upgraded than the first 2 seasons along with the fact that this is the season when Timothy Reid joins the cast & crew as Rick & AJ's streetwise cop buddy from San Diego P.D.(Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown) to help the Simon brothers get inside classfied information to help solve their cases just like the often cynical Jim Rockford(James Garner)had his overworked cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD do on THE ROCKFORD FILES, not to mention that Gerald McRaney had 4 guest starring appearances on the ROCKFORD FILES back in the 1970's before McRaney was even a star.

Mary Carver(Cecilia Simon)has also made a guest starring appearance on the ROCKFORD FILES in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode, so I'm almost surprised that Jameson Parker, Timothy Reid, nor Joan McMurtry(Lt. Abigail Marsh)have never been on the ROCKFORD FILES since Rockford seemed to inspire this show in the early 1980's.

Another thing that was so cool and unusual about this detective drama was SIMON & SIMON was not only the first private detective show about 2 brothers running a private investigations agency together, but it was definitely one of the first private detective dramas about 2 private investigators working together on cases instead of a private investigator working solo running a private-eye agency of their own as opposed to MAGNUM, P.I., THE ROCKFORD FILES, MANNIX, and MATT HOUSTON, since Rockford(James Garner), Magnum(Tom Selleck), Mannix(Michael Connors), and Houston(Lee Horsley)were all private detectives that mostly worked alone and usually had a cop buddy in the police department, except SIMON & SIMON was a private detective show about 2 brothers which were the short-tempered gonzo private-eye Rick Simon(Gerald McRaney)and the often fastidious AJ Simon(Jameson Parker)who not only investigated cases together and ran their P.I. office in Downtown San Diego, but were brothers who had a love/hate relationship with one another who often butted heads even though they always managed to solve most of their investigations.

SIMON & SIMON was also the first and probably only private detective drama to be filmed in America's Finest City(San Diego) instead of L.A., New York City, or San Francisco too since SIMON & SIMON was the first show that I know of that was ever filmed here in San Diego on top of that.

Something else I found kind of intriguing was Rick & A.J. lived an eccentric lifestyle kind of like Rockford did since Rick was not only always strapped for cash like Rockford was, but Rick
lived on a boat in AJ's backyard which was actually in Venice just like Rockford lived alone in a rusty trailer in a parking lot in Malibu by the beach near the famous Pacific Coast Highway and always put his gun in a cookie-jar, and like Rockford, Magnum, and Mannix; the Simon Bros. lived on a shoe-string budget and didn't have money or cool clothes most of the time, but like Rockford, Rick & AJ had brains which helped them solve their cases which made this show almost like Rockford times two in a way, despite the fact that this show was a definite upgrade to THE ROCKFORD FILES and despite the fact that Rick & AJ were more fortunate than Rockford ever was.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1983-1984 Season like
*Dick York in the ""Too Much Of A Good Thing"" episode after his co-starring days as Darren Stephens on BEWITCHED

*Mills Watson in the ""DJ DOA"" episode after his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO

*Bill Boyett in ""The Disappearance Of Harry The Hat"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12

*Jim Whitmore, Jr. in the ""DJ DOA"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's idiotic fellow officer(Det. Bernie Terwilliger)on the police drama HUNTER

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when SIMON & SIMON was on CBS every Thursday night at 9PM after MAGNUM, PI was at 8PM since they were both part of CBS's Thursday night line up from the Fall of 1982 through the Summer of 1986 along with the fact that we get to see all these episodes of this detective drama complete & uncut instead of having to watch them with a bunch of deleted scenes & commercial disruptions when SIMON & SIMON was shown in reruns on A&E, WGN, and now Cozi-TV.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when CBS's motto was ""We've Got The Touch"" and to my childhood days of living in the Imperial Valley since I was 11 years old in the 5th grade at Desert Gardens Elementary School when this season was running on CBS.",1242172800,2,4700,4.798516687268233

3873869,5,B0028S110K,"""Simon & Simon"" was such a spectacular, unique, humorous and fun detective television series.

Like a few other reviewers on here I've had to return this season because of defective discs, TWICE. I originally bought this season in the store when it first came out but that set became defective so I ordered a second set from Amazon, but the discs from that purchase were also defective. I contacted Amazon and they offered to send me another set free of charge, but that set also had the same problems. It's not Amazon's fault, I blame Shout!. It seems they were in such a hurry to release this set so fast after season 2 that they skipped the quality control when producing these discs.",1430697600,,671,4.455284552845528

3873881,5,B0028S110K,"Although I'm a little young to be able to say that I watched this when it aired on television, I DID watch reruns when I was in my late teens.  I fell in love with this show and at one point in time had every episode taped from television... yes, on VHS.  Obviously the quality of those and the fact that I haven't owned a VCR for over 5 years made for a great reason to purchase this series on DVD.  The ONLY problem that I have with this series is that I can't afford $50 per season.  So, I only own up to season 4 and that's because I was able to find some of the seasons cheaper through another store.  Although most of the seasons are probably worth the money, I just can't justify spending that much on an older show even if it was terrific and still is!

Overall, the Simon brothers are terrific characters and I have loved Gerald McRaney in so many other things since this show ended.  Jameson Parker is also terrific in other things that I have seen him in and I don't know if they could have cast two people better.  Having siblings, I realize the connection that siblings can have and it is not easy for two people that are not related to portray this connection in a show... but these two do it beautifully.  This is also a show that my husband loves and he usually hates watching the older tv shows that I love.  You know all those shows that are being remade these days.... how about do this one again but bring the two of them back.  I bet they could still pull it off!",1420156800,,1484,4.13588850174216

OK Amazon service with questionable outcome worth THREE STARS (first time ever under five stars)
Lousy quality DVD product worth ONE STAR.

The first set had some kind of oil smeared on all the DVDs making them unwatchable.  Amazon quickly replaced these with a second set that also had oil on them, although less of it.  They were still unwatchable.

I returned them yet again, and suddenly Amazon canceled my order.  No option to get a third set, just cancelled.  Yes, I got a refund but please, may I be the one to select the option??

So I waited for a bit, thinking I would let whatever quality problems get sorted out.  Couple months later, I go to re-order and the price has gone up like 10 bucks!  Hey!  What gives?

So I'm ordering one more time with the hope the problems are fixed.  And looking for a way to let Amazon know the multiple-return process could use a little help.",1385251200,2,915,4.445783132530121

3873893,2,B0028S110K,This is a heads-up about a potential flaw in packaging.  On the set that I received from Amazon every disk had a filmy layer on it that was sufficient to interfere with playing.  The disks cleaned up and are playing fine but the film soon returned.  I think it is the cheap cases provided.  They are leaching plastic material of some kind onto the disks themselves.  I guess I can keep cleaning them but why would such skanky packaging be used in the first place?  Shame on whoever is responsible.,1317600000,3,497,4.466666666666667

3873895,5,B0028S110K,"This is a wonderful series and I appreciate Shout! Factory for licensing the series from Universal.

This season really takes off with the addition of Tim Reid. Each episode is well written and acted out to perfection.

Sadly, Shout! has announced that they have no plans to release Season 6 (full season) or Seasons 7 and 8 (half seasons each).

It is hard to believe that sales of this series are off when you see ""only 5 left and more on the way"" on every season's page on Amazon. I read on a Shout! Factory page that in addition to low sales there are licensing issues with Season 6 as well.

Hopefully, these issues will get resolved and we can get the complete series released. In the meantime, you can't go wrong with Simon & Simon Season 3!

Now is the time to buy it. I paid $36.00 through Shout! Factory for Season 3, while Amazon now has it priced at $21.00.",1313366400,,869,4.339506172839506
3873896,3,B0028S110K,"I love Simon & Simon, old enough to have watched it when it was live and new on network tv. But its a shame Shout Factory is the one manufacturing these dvds. Not only are they trying to only sell the dvd's at there amateur website, instead of here at Amazon. They do a horrible job of producing these DVD's. I recently purchased Season 2,3,4 new close to 40 bucks each, which I consider a premium price for tv. Considering this is old 4:3 tv low def kinda pricy considering they did no remastering of anykind. This particular DVD set Season 3 had a weird glue/spray residue, I don't know if it was from the artwork printing, ive never encountered that before with new dvds. It was very stubborn stuff and took many cleaning runs on the dvd cleaner before I was confident it would not mess up my dvd player.

There compression is terrible, the 1st season of Simon and Simon was done by a pro, there is a episode on season 2 that is also on season 1, the chrome eagle, you can really see the difference in quality, look for yourself, what the last episode on Season 1 involving the chrome eagle, then compare it to Season 2 the same episode. Quality is cheap for such a high price tag. People who make digital copies  will notice immediately for there ipod. This is a trademark of Shout Factory. I also purchased Max Headroom, another show I loved, I had to check the connections on my dvd player, the quality was terrible on my 1080p 27 inch tv.

Too bad I really love Simon & Simon, but clearly whoever produced Season 1 should have produced the rest, since you probably could download better quality versions then Shout Factory is selling at inflated prices. Shout Factory seems bearly a step up from bootleg quality too bad some very nice shows are under there production.",1303776000,12,1775,4.455384615384616
3873897,5,B0028S110K,"Sibling PI's (and best friends) Rick (Gerald McRaney) and A.J. (Jameson Parker) Simon really hit their stride in this third-season box set, which includes some of their most intriguing cases and also introduces Tim Reid as ""Downtown"" Brown, the plainclothes SDPD lieutenant who quickly becomes almost a third Simon himself.  As is usually the case with this series, many of the episodes aren't even murder cases, yet they work equally as well as the ones that are, and the chemistry between the two leads is something you have to see to believe.  Rick and A.J. tackle such mysteries as the apparent theft of an illusion practiced by a well-known magician, a missing rock DJ, the death of a skydiving record executive married to a former barmaid at their favorite watering hole, a cache of diamonds stolen 30 years ago and never found, a long-lost WW2 B-25 bomber whose existence may prove that its former captain didn't abandon his crew to enemy fire, a hijacked cruise ship, an imperilled witness who happens to be a compulsive gambler, a ring of thieves targeting race horses, a malpractice suit that may be fraudulent, and a murder committed with a gun bearing a fresh fingerprint of the notorious '30's criminal John Dillinger.  And Rick finds himself plagued by repeated terrifying dreams in which he kills his own brother--dreams that may be all too likely to come true.  Mary Carver returns as the Simons' spirited mother Cecelia.  Watch for gems like Rick's ""Ernie Boyer, Sacramento"" (""The Grand Illusion"") and ""Hammerman, Federal Reserve"" (""Harm's Way"") masquerades, A.J.'s reaction when he learns (""Bon Voyage, Alonso"") that the cruise ship on which his mother and brother are travelling has been hijacked, and Cecelia's tearful reactions to stress in ""Alonso"" and ""Double Play.""

There's a certain innocence about it that is completely lacking in many contemporary shows as American society has grown increasingly narcissistic and salacious. The guys still get their fair of action but women are still treated with respect. What a couple of gentlemen. As for the DVD's, season three is, as others said, when the show hit its stride. I'd agree with that although the 1st season has its ""newness"" kind of charm. The brothers make me LOL all the time despite the plot holes that spring up from time to time.

3873903,5,B0028S110K,"There is something nearly magical about being 'on top of your game', and ""Simon & Simon: Season Three"" was truly at it's peak. Not only were stars Jameson Parker (as sweet-tempered, preppy A.J.) and Gerald McRaney (as gonzo Vietnam vet, Rick), superb, and Mary Carver, as their long-suffering but loving mom, Cecilia, given real opportunities to shine (and let's not forget Marlowe, Rick's scene-stealing big ol' mutt), but the arrival of Tim Reid, as funny, street-savvy Det. 'Downtown' Brown, provided the missing element the show needed; a likable authority figure to tell the boys their clients are guilty and their theories, crazy, then join in the adventures to catch the real villains ('deputizing' them, regularly!). While he doesn't arrive until the seventh episode, the chemistry is spontaneous, and by the end of the first appearance, he's 'family'!

For those who followed the series faithfully, some slight but noticeable 'tweaking' is evident; Rick's 'Nam backstory is beefed up, providing more dramatic opportunities (if making some of his first season silliness a bit out-of-character); the stakes are raised (with the brothers occasionally in REAL hot water with the police on both sides of the border); and the clients and fees are a bit higher-class (although the guys still have problems collecting!)

Some stand-out episodes: ""Shadow of Sam Penny"", a nifty Film Noir detective movie homage, with film legends Scott Brady, Dane Clark, Joan Leslie, Anne Francis, Elisha Cook, Jr., and TV's best 1960s leading man, Robert Lansing, as Penny; ""The Bare Facts"", with the brothers 'under cover' at a nudist colony (no easy feat on G-rated network TV!); ""Betty Grable Flies Again"", with Pat Hingle as a disgraced WWII AAF pilot trying to find his old plane (a beautiful, vintage bomber); ""The Wrong Stuff"", with Gary (""2001: A Space Odyssey"") Lockwood again an astronaut, if an alcoholic, washed-up one; ""Double Play"", where the boys are framed, arrested in Mexico, and lose their license, with Mary Carver giving a moving speech on her unhappiness at their careers; and ""The Dillinger Print"", a potentially farfetched tale of gangster John Dillinger still being alive, lifted by one of Parker's finest porformances of the entire series, and cameos by veteran 'tough guys' Harold J. Stone and ""The Untouchables"" Bruce ('Frank Nitti') Gordon.

This is THE season, the real start of the best seasons of the series, and if you love ""Simon & Simon"" (or would like to see why the show was so popular and ran so long), this is a great place to find out!",1251331200,15,2560,5.09047619047619
