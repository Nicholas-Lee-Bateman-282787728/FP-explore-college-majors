The narration is monotonous. The editing is equally dull and the whole film looks so dated. If you were merely a fashion or fashionable victim, don't waste your time on this biography.",1173398400,2,337,4.365079365079365
8154777,1,B000F6ZC2A,"This is not a serious Armani's biography but a minimal summary of his most well known steps of his life.

You get the same information in a magazine article not longer than ONE PAGE.

No videos except some fashion show which you can see everyday on TV!

Even the few picture (totally 15) are repeated 100 times..ridiculous.

Armani deserves much more that this ridiculous 25 minutes DVDs...

I'm trying to get my money back! If not I will stop buying DVDs from Amazon. Promised!",1168819200,3,478,4.642857142857143
