8470828,5,B005FXY77Y,"I have been looking for the best software/books to immerse my kids in Arabic so they can understand some of what their father says when he is on the phone!. I've bought tons of books, Several Cartoons dubbed in Arabic and several DVDs from ""Little thinkers"" series.
The thing is none of these is enough by itself. And it is really hard to get your kids learn another language when they are surrounded by another. For success a lot of effort and perseverance is needed. And I mean a lot. Also you need books, DVDs, Interactions and patience. As for DVDs, this is the BEST out there that I have seen so far. My son is in Love with Sinbad. He can't get enough of Sinbad day and night! He watches with full attention and I know he absorbs when he starts talking to me in Arabic. I know it is from Sinbad because my 3 year old son now uses ""formal"" arabic that I don't use with him or over the phone. He asks in arabic. He makes arabic sentences (not a conversation but still) and he sings some of the Sibnad songs.
As a tool Arabian Sinbad is in no way enough by itself but It is the most useful cartoon that I have found out there.",1395360000,2,1128,4.155251141552512

8470831,5,B005FXY77Y,"I bought this from ArabianSinbad.com and not from Amazon. However, looking at the description and the photos at Amazon, it is the same item as that on the ArabianSinbad.com site.

Arabic is not my native language, but I have been learning Arabic for more than ten years, most recently pursuing an MA in the language. I had also started talking to my daughter in Arabic, and reading her some Arabic books, but she was not getting as much immersed in the language primarily because it is the third language in the house. An Egyptian friend referred me to Arabian Sinbad as I was discussing how to immerse her into the language. On his recommendation I bought this set.

I was quite surprised both at the quality of the cartoon and the content, it exceeded my expectations. The clip that is provided on Amazon perhaps does not do justice to the movie which is full of songs, conversations, funny clips revolving around a story where Sinbad, and his sister go through a number of adventures. The series employs the language immersion skills well in that there is reasonable repetition of the concepts and vocabulary with different angles, and a lot of repetition of common vocabulary words, such as colors, numbers. This helps achieve the goal of those vocabulary items getting ingrained in one's mind. The setting is the modern Arabic setting, in which the characters behave and act as people do in Arab world, which is quite helpful from a language learning point of view.

There is a CD with the games, which turned out to be very good for my daughter too. She just loves them because she gets to select some scenes, color them, put some artifacts (such as animals, humans, etc.) During this process, she gets to hear and identify the vocabulary items which gives her enhanced exposure. These days, she is emphatic about learning numbers in Arabic because without knowing those numbers, in one game, Sinbad falls from rocks into water and she doesn't want him to fall.

I found the other things that came along, such as the flashcards and the songs CD, interesting that I could use later, but we never got around to it and it didn't provide us with as much value because we have to spend more time with English and Urdu which are her primary languages.

There are some peeves I have about it too. The caricatures of horse and donkey are confusing enough for her that she can't recognize which is which in isolation. Similarly, many other animals and fruits are unrecognizable for kids simply because they are caricatures and sometimes beyond recognition. I have to overcome this challenge by having to use the vocabulary for those items in home, which takes away my time from her from other languages. There was one banner, which I didn't find as much useful. It would have been better if the poster were about human body, or solar system, or something else that kids find interesting.

I still give it five stars because it is definitely worth the money. I have had it for about a year and we still have a lot of material to cover. The way the series builds up and introduces concepts, and the way the everyday conversations are presented expedite language learning. I think the curve is pretty fast for small kids, so we have to go to the next episode a bit slowly. For instance, we watched episodes 5-6 some 20 times before we moved to 7 as she was still grasping new stuff and enjoying it every time we watched it. For older kids (> 5 or 6 yrs) and adults, the progress should be quicker. Most importantly, there is an option to enable/disable subtitles in Arabic which is helpful if a word's pronunciation is not clear.

In short, I am so satisfied with this purchase that I am also going to recommend this as a great learning tool for students to the director at the University. There are definitely some concepts about everyday Arabic that I learnt from this, and didn't grasp elsewhere. As they say, the more time you spend in a language and a culture, the more you learn.

The biggest caveat for anyone buying this is that it will teach you Modern Standard Arabic and not the regional Arabic of various countries. After using this, do not expect to converse fluently in the streets of an Arab country, for that, you will have to invest into Rosetta Stone or Pimsleur or, better yet, take some classes with an instructor. I have myself bought Pimsleur Arabic CDs in the past, but I gave those up quickly (my experience with Turkish was quite better). Our goal is to learn Modern Standard Arabic because it is language of the print media as well as scholarship in the Arab world, and sets the basis for learning Classical and Medieval Arabic.",1347062400,4,4648,4.632281553398058
