7979372,3,B000087F0U,"The movie looks like a slasher but don't be fooled. I bought this movie because I am a Mark Pellegrino fan. He was the only character I liked. It's just disturbing in the fact that the main character kidnaps a woman who is disabled and molests her. It doesn't show the scene where she is molested but still very disturbing. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who is sensitive to swearing, nudity and rape. It was ok. Just don't expect it to be a good movie.",1491609600,,464,4.344827586206897

The description sounded great, but the movie was not. I really have to question the competency of the company that would make such a thing. AVOID!",1361664000,,312,4.6909090909090905

He plays Ronnie, a kid who never developed the social skills necessary for everyday survival in the real world. One day, while working at his halfway home for the mentally ill. At one point he sees a girl, Sarah, standing naked in a shower, and he decides to spirit her away to his room at home for a night of romance. However, that same night, his brother (Mark Pellegrino, always great) returns from prison; he brings several junkie friends and his girlfriend. Ronnie has to handle this situation very carefully, or he could be in a load of trouble, right?
Luckily, though, everyone in this movie is mentally ""slow"" (as Ronnie is described) or drug-addled, so it escalates quickly. Trust me, if nothing else, Adam Scott and Mark Pellegrino in a movie together should be enough of a reason to buy this. If it isn't, however, just go read some more reviews on any other site. The other guy on here is part of the overwhelming minority.
Stupid people making stupid decisions, as it were. You'd figure he'd have gotten it. : /",1301443200,4,1136,4.628712871287129
