8188833,5,B000A7DW76,"An interesting film with an unexpected end... Contains, love scenes, drama, mystery and a great story that covers a wide spectrum of psicological performances, inside scenes full of emotion with jorge (Arturo de Cordova) that fell in love with Monica (Rosita Quintana). Passion developed in front of their jealousy antagonist, Magdalena (Maria Douglas). Again, a superb performance of Arturo de Cordova with extended and extraordinary dialogues that shows really a contemporary gentleman inside intelligent love relationships!...Highly recommended... Good Luck!",1133827200,9,561,6.113924050632911
