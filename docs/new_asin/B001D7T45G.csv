3526746,3,B001D7T45G,"If I was to select our 10 greatest, I would have to select the Super Bowl wins even if I would much prefer to have other games since I have the 90's Super Bowl victories in my personal library. Lets just find 5. Okay, so of the choices we had, I agree with two. The 1975 stunning, thrilling victory over the Minnesota Vikings that features one of our greatest moments ever, the 'Hail Mary'! And one of my personal favorites the 1980-81 fourth quarter comeback over Atlanta. What makes both of these games so memorable was the improbable finishes and the fact they both were on the road in the playoffs!
For the final three choices I wouldnt have selecting any of the championship games. Why? Well, most of these games are in circulation or they were played in a time when we could tape them or you can simply find these games anywhere but I want to point out that it doesnt erase their significance. But if I was to choose anyone of the three it would have been the '92 NFC championship game @ San Francisco and stunned the 49ers 11 years after 'The Catch'. We did to them what they did to us a decade earlier! The other championship games were almost expected and thus is why I have a short, abbreviated list that could have ben considerd.
When you think of our history, we have to include our equalibrium, The Redskins! There have been so many memorable games and the most notable ones that should have been considered are: 1974 Thanksgiving comeback with Clint Longley! An obvious top ten if Super Bowls aren't added. One that makes my list was Staubach's last regular season game vs. Washington in 1979. Less than 10 seconds to go Staubach pulls it out 35-34! That is a no-brainer. Extremely disappointed it didn't make the list! 1983 season opener @ RFK against the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins. We were down 23-3 at the half and won it 31-30! To this day it is our greatest comeback ever and its the Redskins. Its tough not to include that one. This game actually features a 77- yard run by Dorsett only to have ben caught from behind by Hall of Fame rookie Darrell Green, the 'fastest man in football'. A personal favorite of mine was from 1988. We went 3-13 that year and we went into RFK and beat the 'Skins 24-17 in what would be Tom Landry's 270th and final victory! How sweet is that! This game features a rookie Wide Receiver by the name of Michael Irvin who actually scores 3 Touchdowns. 1991 we march into RFK and beat, again, the defending Super Bowl champion 'Skins who, by the way, were 11-0 going into the game! Again, how incredibly sweet is that!?
We've had equally just as many memorable games vs. the Eagles: 1980 home finale @ Texas Stadium was a game we had to win by, at least, 17 points. Many don't know its importance in our history, but to diehard Cowboy fans it was a huge game and very memorable. Eagles pretty much had their way with us until 1991 and a late season game @ The Vet. We beat the Eagles and their stranglehold they had on us and clinched a playoff berth with that win. It ended a 6- year playoff drought for the Cowboys and the Cowboys of the 90's first playoff appearance! Again, it was a rivalry game and on the road and a significant moment in our history.
I cant ommitt The importance of Emmitt and shouldering the load in a 1993 division clinching and home field advantage win @ New York. Without Emmitt playing with a seperated shoulder, which is unimaginable, we might not even play in Super Bowl XXVIII! That game makes this list on Emmitt's heart! I have to go back 8 year now and mention a game that was played in 1985 vs. New York. We weren't supposed to win the division but we did and in this game we pulled out the division on the strength of a patented 'Too Tall' batted ball. Too Tall batted down a Phil Simms pass right into the hands of Jim Jeffcoat who then rumbled half a football field and more to help preserve the division championship and the game, 28-21. We have had unbelievable wins against our rivals and even against inferior opponents like New Orleans. Twice from my recollection. Both wins occurred when our defense sacked Saints QB's in the endzone one resulting in a Safety to win 21-20 (we were down 20-19). And the other a fumble recovered in the endzone from that sack. Back to back years in '83 and '84. But that just touches a few in countless other wins not even mentioned over our storied history. I recommend Time Warner and NFL Films to release a 2nd edition.
With all that I mentioned here, the ONE game that absolutely has to be part of this would be that 1979 finale vs. Washington. Before the game the 'Skins had placed a wreath in the Cowboys locker room symbolizing their 'death'! After the game Harvey Martin 'visited' the 'Skins locker room and threw it right at them. Now that would be nice bonus material! I think the majority of Cowboy fans would agree that this game is missing.",1226102400,2,4888,4.432222222222222
3526747,5,B001D7T45G,As a 39 yr old fan and one for as long as I could remember this is a great volume.  It is nice to actually see Super Bowl 7 even though the quality is poor.  I want more games!  We need the 1979 game against Washington; the Clint Longley Thanksgiving Day game against Washington; The 1993 Giants game were Emmitt injures his shoulder; the 1999 opener against Washington when Aikman throws that bomb to Rocket; and even last years Monday Night Game against Buffalo where Romo brings the `boys back.,1225756800,3,497,4.5
3526748,4,B001D7T45G,"Not a bad choice of games, but not the best choices!! The 5 Super Bowl Victories that goes without saying they need to be there although Super Bowl VI has poor quality and looks like a public access High School Game but what can you expect from 1972 Technology??? SBXII gets better, 27, 28, and 30 CRYSTAL CLEAR!! Now to comment on the other games in this pack.

VS Atlanta in the 1981 playoffs??? That is not exactly the 1st of great games when think Cowboys.  Drew Peason the hail mary good choice but save it for a volume 2. All the NFC Championships in the 90s vs 49ERS and Packers GREAT, but what about the NFC Championships of the 70's ve the 49ERS RAMS and Vikings???

NO REDSKINS GAMES!!!! Thats bad, there had better be a volume 2!!! 1974 Thanksgiving, 1979 Staubachs last game, 1983 coming back for a 23-3 halftime deficit, 1985 Happy BDay Theismann 44-14, 1992 Opening Night 23-10, 1999 41-35 in OT,  JUST TO NAME A FEW, there is a lot of Thanksgiving and Monday Nights to consider

NO GIANT GAMES!!! The 16-13 in 1994 (93 Season) when Emmitt cracked his shoulder is worth mentioning, or the 35-0 Opening Night Game when they retired Simms Jersey in 95, or better yet the OT Game in 2003 35-32 when the Tuna returned to Meadowlands as New Dallas Coach!! Come on!!!

NO EAGLE Games!!! 34-10 in the 92 Playoffs and 30-11 in the 95 Playoffs when Deion has that crazy touchdown!!!

OK NFL FILMS GET STARTED, I GAVE YOU ENOUGH INPUT TO MAKE 2 MORE VOLUMES GET TO IT!!!",1225584000,2,1474,4.416974169741698
3526749,3,B001D7T45G,"With the billions of dollars that NFL films has made over the years, the poor quality of some of the games is unacceptable.  There is no excuse for NFL films to not digitally restore the games for the Cowboys fans.  Also the fact that NFL films does not advertise that the games are in such poor condition (and missing parts of the game) on the advertisements and the box is shoddy marketing.  Sure they have a disclaimer ON the disc, but you only see that after you purchase the product.
Poor job by NFL films.",1225324800,,511,4.3578947368421055
3526750,4,B001D7T45G,"Since the early reviews have blasted Warner Home Video for the games they chose as the Dallas Cowboys' ""10 Greatest Games,"" I thought it was important to point out that THE FANS THEMSELVES helped choose five of these ten games!

Obviously, five of the ten games were going to be the Cowboys' Super Bowl triumphs. To determine the five remaining games, fans were asked on the Cowboys' official website to vote for their favorites. They were, however, given only nine choices:

1975 Playoffs - Cowboys vs. Vikings - The ""Hail Mary"" from Staubach to Pearson...

1977 NFC Championship Game - Cowboys vs. Vikings

1980 Playoffs - Cowboys vs. Falcons - The Danny White-led come from behind win...

1983 Cowboys at Vikings - Tony Dorsett's 99 yard TD run...

1992 NFC Championship Game - Cowboys vs. 49ers

1993 NFC Championship Game - Cowboys vs. 49ers

1995 NFC Championship Game - Cowboys vs. Packers

2002 Cowboys vs. Seahawks - Emmitt Smith breaks the all-time rushing record...

2006 Cowboys vs. Buccaneers - Tony Romo throws five touchdowns on Thanksgiving Day...

Now, who chose those nine games and why they chose those nine games, I couldn't tell you. But, given such limited choices, it does look like the fans got it right -- the Hail Mary game, the Atlanta playoff comeback, and the three NFC Championship games of the 90s. Maybe it would have been nicer to see the 75 NFC Championship game or the Dorsett game (which the Cowboys lost, by the way), but it's hard to argue with the results -- again, given such limited choices.

Certainly, the biggest omission is the 1979 season-ending shootout win over the Redskins. That is, without question, one of the greatest games in Dallas Cowboys history, if not THE greatest. Maybe Warner couldn't get the original network broadcast of the game. I don't know. But Warner did include a lengthy recap and highlight reel of that game as a bonus feature on Disc 1 of the first ""Complete History of the Dallas Cowboys"" DVD. They described it as ""the greatest game of the NFL's greatest rivalry"" and yet, it didn't make the Cowboys' Top 10. Go figure.

But it is what it is. It's hard to argue with the inclusion of the five Super Bowl victories, the Hail Mary game, or the Atlanta playoff comeback and certainly the NFC Championship games over the 49ers and Packers are AMONG the greatest in Cowboys history. This may not be a definitive collection, but it is nice to be able to watch the original network broadcasts of some of the greatest moments in the rich history of America's Team.",1225065600,27,2531,4.725
3526751,3,B001D7T45G,"I most emphatically agree that the exclusion of 1979 Redskins game at Texas Stadium reduces the value of this collection by one star. But what about Roger Staubach's FIRST great come-from-behind win, the early Seventies game in San Francisco that was such a gas that Larry Cole was filmed rolling on the ground in glee? That it is also overlooked reduces this collection by a second star. It is obvious that whomever chose the games that are included in this set is either too young, or just not well enough exposed to the history of the team to even be allowed in the same sports bar as the rest of us. What about the Mad Bomber? What about the 1980 or 1981 Eagles game at Texas Stadium, where the Cowboys had to win by 14 or 17 points in order to go to the playoffs, and less points meant that they would watch the post season from at home? We called that little get-together Game Won, Season Lost. Smokin' hot Cowboys on a bitterly cold Texas afternoon. This was the game where so many footballs flew up into the stands that the league forbade throwing footballs to the fans forevermore. And that shot that Dennis Thurman gave Harold Carmichael is the next greatest hit ever by a Cowboys safety, second only to what happened to Robert Brooks' coach in 1995. Move over Cliff Harris, you're only third place now. And where are videos of some of your nastiest work?
  Three stars for this short set of videos Time/Warner has released. Razzies for the short-sighted persons who did the choosing.",1225065600,3,1494,4.550185873605948
3526752,2,B001D7T45G,"This is a pretty paltry selection of games. Sure the Superbowl victories were satisfying for Cowboys fans, but they were far from being even decent games.  Superbowls X and XIII were superior games, even though Cowboy losses.  And where in the world are the Redskins in this collection?  How can this be considered a collection of greatest Dallas Cowboys games without, at the very least, Staubach's last comeback in the 1979 home finale or the 1991 game at RFK Stadium when the Cowboys defeated the 11-0 Redskins?  Both great Dallas games.  Or the 1999 season opener in Washington, when Dallas overcame a 35-14 4th quarter deficit to win in overtime?  How about the Emmitt game at Giants Stadium in the 1993 season finale?  This collection contains exactly no games against NFC East divisional foes, and that is an absolute travesty.  I agree that the Atlanta Comeback and the 1992 and 1995 NFC Championships were great games.  As for the rest...  No Eagles games.  No Giants games.  No Redskins games!  Ridiculous...

That said, the quality of what is here is pretty good.  As these disks are made from the original broadcasts, the quality is about the same as if you watched them on a good television.  I miss the little pre-game prologues that Pat Summerall used to narrate, but the games are presented well, with chapter stops at each quarter.  The packaging is great.  Very easy to negotiate.",1223596800,6,1398,4.827004219409282

Dallas is behind and he throws a touchdown pass to tight end Billy Joe DuPree to get the Cowboys back in the game [after trailing 16-3 at one point.] Dallas trailing 23-17, time was running out. With Longley standing at the 50-yardline with 30 seconds left he throws a ""Hail Mary"" to Drew Pearson, who had slipped behind the defensive backs.

3526795,3,B001D7T45G,"This set gets three stars because they got it kinda right. The five Super Bowl wins are no-brainers, simply because of their significance. The Hail Mary game, the 1980 playoff game vs. Atlanta, and the 1992 NFL title game vs. San Francisco are also excellent choices. But you can leave out the 1993 and '95 NFC title games. While they are good games, they are not classic games.

The thing that struck me right away, though, was the fact that there isn't one game against the Redskins. How is that possible?!? Ask any longtime Cowboys fan about great games vs. the Redskins, and you'll get a lot of different answers, like the Longley comeback on Thanksgiving Day in 1974, Staubach's double-comeback in the 1979 season finale, the Monday Night Football comeback in 1983, the Monday Night Football game to open the season in 1992, and even the 1999 comeback on opening day. Any one of could be on these discs.

Now I realize that original game tapes don't exist for some of these games from the 1970s. But they could have at least included a special disc detailing their rivalry with the 'Skins, with highlights from their notable games. I know they also released a separate Cowboys-Redskins disc-set, but that one is an utter joke.

I hope they decide to come out with a second volume of games at some point so that some of these games can be included. And they can also include some of the fine battles they had with the 49ers and Rams in the '70s, as well.",1358899200,,1458,4.557251908396947
3526796,5,B001D7T45G,"Even though the Dallas Cowboys have not made a Super Bowl appearance so far this century, ""America's Team"" still has one of the most illustrious histories in the NFL during the Super Bowl era.  This DVD set contains edited versions of the original network telecasts of ten of the greatest games in Cowboys history.  The games contained are as follows:

*  1/16/72 - Super Bowl VI.  The Cowboys finally shed the ""Next Year's Champions"" and ""The Team That Can't Win the Big One"" monikers, capturing their first-ever world title with a 24-3 win over the Miami Dolphins in New Orleans.  It was definitely a different era in that the game was played in what looks like the early afternoon.  Ray Scott and Pat Summerall called the game.

*  12/28/75 - NFC Divisional Playoff.  Roger Staubach hits Drew Pearson with the famous Hail Mary pass in the last minute of the game to give Dallas a 17-14 win over the Vikings in Minnesota.

*  1/15/78 - Super Bowl XII.  The Cowboys take advantage of numerous Broncos turnovers in the Superdome to win 27-10 and earn their second world title in the first Super Bowl played in a domed stadium.

*  1/4/81 - NFC Divisional Playoff.  Danny White leads Dallas back from a 14-point deficit as the Cowboys beat the Falcons 30-27 in Atlanta.  Vin Scully was the play-by-play man for this broadcast.

*  1/17/93 - NFC Championship Game.  In a classic game between two teams with absolutely loaded rosters, the Cowboys advance to their first Super Bowl in 14 years and first of the Jerry Jones-Jimmy Johnson era with a 30-20 win over the 49ers at Candlestick Park in San Francisco.  Troy Aikman hit Alvin Harper for a long pass play late that led to the score that put the game away--The Slant was sweet revenge for The Catch, and if I could borrow Doc Brown's DeLorean to go back and see one game from Cowboys history in person, this is the one I'd pick.  This victory is the one that led Johnson to exclaim ""How 'Bout Them Cowboys!""

*  1/31/93 - Super Bowl XXVII.  In a game that was anticlimactic compared to the NFC Championship Game, the Cowboys crush the Bills 52-17 to win their first world championship in 15 years in what was the last Super Bowl played in the Rose Bowl.  Dick Enberg and Bob Trumpy call the game for NBC.

*  1/23/94 - NFC Championship Game.  Dallas makes good on Jimmy Johnson's victory guarantee as the team plays a near-flawless first half, opening up a 28-7 halftime lead over the 49ers en route to an easy 38-21 win at Texas Stadium.  This was the final game of the NFC's long run on CBS, and Pat Summerall and John Madden called it.

*  1/30/94 - Super Bowl XXVIII.  Dallas erases a 13-6 Buffalo halftime lead to win 30-13 at the Georgia Dome in what turned out to be Jimmy Johnson's last game as coach of the Cowboys.  The Cowboys become the fifth franchise to win back-to-back Super Bowls.

*  1/14/96 - NFC Championship Game.  In an entertaining seesaw affair, Dallas scores two fourth-quarter touchdowns to pull out a 38-27 win over Green Bay at Texas Stadium.  It was the Cowboys' first win over the Packers in an NFC title game.

*  1/28/96 - Super Bowl XXX.  The Cowboys become the first franchise to win three Super Bowls in four seasons as they hold off Pittsburgh 27-17 at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe.  It is the last Super Bowl triumph for Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith, and the rest of the Nineties Cowboys and is also the first time the Cowboys beat the Steelers in a Super Bowl.

There are a few missing plays from the games from the Seventies, but the vast majority of the games are here.  It is also interesting to see how much less NFL players weighed then and how much the style of play has changed--today's game is definitely superior to the game that was played 35-40 years ago.  Any die-hard Dallas Cowboys fan would appreciate watching these key games from the team's past.",1358380800,2,3863,4.526772793053546

3526821,5,B001D7T45G,"The ten discs DVD set basically covers the 3 90's Dynasty Cowboys Superbowls and 3 NFC Championship victories.
The other 4 games are the 2 Superbowl victories from the 70's, The historic 1975 ""Hail Mary"" playoff game versus the Vikings and the one 1981 Atlanta playoff comeback.

Here is a brief synopsis and critique of each disc:

Disc 1: Superbowl VI: Cowboys vs Dolphins 1972

Anything from the Cowboys of the 70's is appreciated and needed. There is, limited footage of the 70's Cowboys and so many great games. Certainly there could be a 10 game DVD set for the 70's Cowboys alone. Superbowl VI occured in 1972 so the footage isn't exactly digital it's old tape and you can tell. It's too bad this hasn't been restored in its entirety. I guess Steve Sabel and NFL Films doesn't deem the old Superbowls worthy enough to preserve in their entirety. A big mistake I believe on their part. However, I am glad to have the original broadcast. In a way, I think it's better. You get a peephole into the past and how it would have looked on a  t.v. set back in 1972. Yes, it's hard to watch, but once you get used to it it's not so bad. Makes me realize how spoiled we are with our HD these days...

The game is pretty uneventful; Dallas wins fairly easily, but seeing Staubach play, any Staubach in its original broadcast is priceless. The three games we get on this set from the 70's make the whole thing worth buying and watching again and again...

Disc 2: The Hail Mary Game: Cowboys vs Vikings 1975

Good to see the greatest Cowboy`s moment; ""The Hail Mary Pass,"" preserved for all eternity. This is the most important of all games and I'm so happy to have it to watch whenever I want!

Disc 3: Superbowl XII: Cowboys Vs Broncos 1977

I really enjoyed watching this game. A treasure. You just have to see it for yourself. It's something special. Staubach, Dorsett, Pearson, Too Tall Jones, Randy White, Harvey Martin etc. all at their best! This is a historic moment in Cowboy's and America's history.

Disc 4: The Atlanta Comeback: Cowboys vs Atlanta 1981

Glad to see Danny White getting in on the glory. Many fans have forgotten just what a great quarterback he was, I'm glad to see one his finer moments on DVD. This actually is my favorite of all the games on the DVD set. The quality is actually pretty good and you get to see The Cowboys at the height of their popularity in the early 80's winning in the last seconds in the playoffs. Dallas gets a lot of respect from the commentators here as well. This is also a good look at what football was like in the early 80's when I first starting watching football. What a great time it was, even though Dallas didn't get to a Superbowl.
The last thing you see is Landry walking off the field, stoic and cool as ever.

Disc 5: NFC Championship: Cowboys vs 49ers 1993

This is a good one. The two great Harper catches, Dallas getting revenge from the 1982 Championship loss, Staubach on the sidelines. Aikman becoming the next great Cowboy's quarterback. It's all here, the beginning of the 90's Cowboy's dynasty. The 49ers and their terrible field, (which was partly restored for that game.) A lot of history in this game, I've watched it many times and will watch it many more.

Disc 6: Superbowl XXVII: Cowboys vs Bills 1993

Great to see Dallas win a Superbowl after all those years of being pushed down by the league. I hated the part where in the 3rd quarter Irvin makes a spectacular touchdown catch and right after, all they show is Thurman Thomas pouting on the sidelines for the whole celebration. You hear the crowd screaming and music playing and they cut the whole thing out by showing one player on the opposing team, I felt cheated in a way. At the end, Leon Lett's ruined touchdown by the Bills Bee Bee who swats the ball out of his hand after he crosses the goal line denying Dallas the record for the most points in a Superbowl. It's clear he crosses the goal line and it was petty of the refs to take that touchdown away from Lett.

Actor Gary Busey is shown standing on the Dallas Sideline yucking it up with the Cowboys players.
I always knew I liked Gary Busey!

One thing I like about the coverage for this game is they do bring up a lot of Superbowl facts and the commentators talk up the Cowboys a lot, which is good.

Disc 7: NFC Championship: Cowboys vs 49ers 1994

This game is just plain sad for the 49ers who's offense is totally dominated by The Cowboys massive defense. Steve Young is so harrasssed and haggard by the end of the game he looks like he's been drug around by a truck. Aikman gets his famous concussion in this game and Bernie Kozar steps in and throws two touchdowns! Alvin Harper and Michael Irvin are unstoppable!
We get a John Madden/Pat Summerall game here. It's the last game ever done by them for CBS. Also this is a last look at the old Texas stadium turf with the red stripes on the 50 and 20 yard lines. You can tell the carpet needs to be changed for there are a lot of wet spots all over the field. So it's historic on many levels.

Disc 8: Superbowl XXVIII: Cowboys vs Bills 1994

This game is fun to watch, Dallas starts out slow but they have the game in hand the whole time. The coverage is better than the previous Superbowls in my opinion. The close ups in the game are really good and the commentary is positive.

Disc 9: NFC Championship Game: Cowboys vs Packers 1996

This is a good game to watch, although I think its my least favorite of the games on the set. Dallas pretty much handles the Packers and a young Brett Favre is shut down from doing much of anything.

Disc 10: Superbowl XXX: Cowboys vs Steelers 1996

The last Cowboys Superbowl. A very magical game and it brings back a lot of memories for me.
It was great to see Dallas beat the Pittsburg Steelers. In a way, this is the greatest Superbowl, it undoes the curse and dispels the shadow cast over The Cowboys and its fans by the Steelers Superbowls of the 70's.
This was a game that I believe the commentators really wanted to see Pittsburg win. There is even one part where commentator Dick Enberg says something interesting after Dallas going for it on 4th and 1. The Cowboys make it and he states that Dallas ""having the biggest offensive line and the biggest fullback (Darrel Johnston) just isn't fair."" When I heard that for the first time I laughed out loud. (Funny how when Dallas wins, it isn't ""fair."") I think this Superbowl was the beginning of the football media becoming heavily anti-Cowboy and you can tell by listening to the commentators spin on the game. Nevertheless the fans in the stadium are clearly pro Dallas and the cheering is always higher than for the Steelers when Dallas does something like score touchdowns.

I noticed a theme with the three 90's Superbowls; Dallas has their own music play when they score, this is unlike any other team I've ever seen in all the other Superbowls. Although the media may tell you different; those 90's Cowboys were extremely popular thanks in part to what the Cowboys teams did in the past (70's and 80's) and also in part to just how good the 90's Cowboys were. The best team ever assembled in the history of the NFL.",1273017600,6,7167,4.439451637471439

That way we'd have some Tony Romo.

3526842,5,B001D7T45G,"I was so excited to find this available (especially after the 2008 season came crashing down).  My only disappointment is that the set did not include Roger Staubach's final regular season game - the one where he led 2 TD drives in the last 2-3 minutes to beat Washington 35-34.  I'm not sure which of the 10 I would replace, but I've wanted to watch that game again for almost 30 years now...

I have not watched all 10 yet, but the ones I have were great.  It's very interesting to see how broadcasting has changed over the years - even as recently as the mid 90's they hadn't yet started showing the continual graphic with score, down & distance, etc. across the top of the screen.  It was also very weird to see, at the opening of SB XXVII, O.J. Simpson as the honorary coin-tosser.

I'm very happy with my purchase and can't wait to finish watching the set.",1232668800,,862,4.35625

3526844,5,B001D7T45G,"After waiting for years, NFL films is finally releasing old Super Bowl and playoff games in their entirety on dvd. America's team gets the dvd treatment with a 10 disc set that includes all 5 super bowl wins and 5 other great games chosen by the fans. I won't list all games as you can look that up in other reviews. The video quality of these games are pretty good. Since more than half the games are from the nineties, the original broadcast quality is very good on these dvds. Each dvd says at the start that these games are from the original broadcast on the day of the game and that some plays and video footage may be missing. The only game that is lower quality is Super Bowl 6 against the Dolphins which is to be expected as this game dates from 1972. This is the only game in the set that is incomplete as it is missing some plays and scoring field goals, but since the game was one sided, its not that big of a deal. Each dvd has 3 annoying NFL promos at the start up of the disc and you have to skip them each time who want to get to the game. They should have just put them on the first disc and not on all 10. You can select each quater from the menu of every game and other than the 2 Super Bowl wins against the Bills, there are no post game interviews or award ceremonies for the other games. The dvds are placed in separate plastic binders within the large snap case thats about the width of 2 normal size dvd cases. There is no other additonal information or booklet included with the set, so if you want to look up the stats from each game, you should try online. Being a big Cowboys fan, I have to say that I'm very satisfied with this collection. It's nice to finally have whole NFL games on dvd. I just hope that they'll release another Cowboys set in the future that has even more games from the Staubach era and some classic division rival matchups.
