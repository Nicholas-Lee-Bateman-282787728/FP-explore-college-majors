The only comment I have is that Kurt Carr and Singers should have appeared often as a ""frame"" in the video so that you can see the exercise steps at the same time as you see the choir.  Sometimes during the exercises, the camera shifts to the choir so much that you miss the next exercise steps. Wonderful idea though.  Wish they would release a new video or create a series.  Also, they could use some more African-Amercian dancers in the video and other people too that are not the perfect body weight.",1083628800,13,641,4.444444444444445
7952861,5,B00005RJ1I,"This is one of my favorite workout videos, and has been since I purchased it nearly 10 years ago.  I just wish it was available on DVD.  Not many people have VHS players anymore and I would like to give it as gifts to dear acquaintances and  students, (thanks partially to Michelle's influence, I now teach PraiseMoves(R), a Christian alternative to yoga).  This video was challenging at first, but I stuck with it and mastered the steps & stretches about the 5th time through it.  Even tho. some of the music is older than I am (60), it has helped keep me young at heart, body & mind.",1451606400,,585,4.37962962962963

7952867,3,B00005RJ1I,"Gospel Aerobics has good beats, but what are you promoting of importance to be doing, gospel singers or aerobic exercise?? It should be exercising with good gospel music in the background, not gospel music in the forefront. This needs to be remade, it is so confusing to a greenhorn exerciser like me!! The purpose is exercise in this video right? Keep the focus on exercise, the image of flying around in different angles with the camera is very frustrating to me.  Flashing to the singers so often and not seeing what is happening with the exercisers is not right, you don't know if you are in step. Michelle LeMay directions need to be said when we see her on video, not to see singers faces or singers dancing etc. Have a small caption of the singers in the corner or something, it really bothers me with this.  I bought this video over 7 years ago from Avon when i was representative, but did not open it until today, so I can't return it. I guess, i love the beats and the gospel songs but I do like more different gospel songs than the ones on the video.  I am disappointed, but I will keep trying to keep up with the video, but it is difficult to know what to do and where you are at, when they show the upper body and not the steps in the feet, it is at different angles changing often and not consistent enough to keep at it in step. I am giving my review after one day, but it should not be confusing enough like it is to me, to not want to continue with this video. It is very frustrating when i am trying to commit to get out of this place of stagnant mode i am in. So i will keep at it each day, and maybe i will memorize what is going on so it will be more familiar as the time goes, perseverance and patience i feel will be my key. I can do all things through Christ who gives me the Strength. Phil. 4:13  God Bless, Sandra Judkins",1296604800,,1847,4.1364902506963785
7952868,5,B00005RJ1I,I enjoyed the exercise video and the speedy service.  I exercised to it a few times.  It was fun and I enjoyed the music.,1281052800,,121,4.0
7952869,5,B00005RJ1I,"I hate to sweat, but the dance like moves are so fun I forget about sweating.  Also just when I am getting tired and would like to give up, Michelle gives me a little pep talk and busts a new move and I just have to keep going.

The choices of songs are just at the right time.  It is like G-d knows I am week and I can rejoice in Him and keep going.

The stretches turn out to be so rewarding and finish off the video wonderfully.  Michelle also explains why I should do them.  Gives me a nice lean look without bulking up.

When I start looking good, give glory and honor not to me, but to Adoni, the one true G-d; the maker of the Heavens and the Earth.",1210809600,4,656,3.887218045112782
