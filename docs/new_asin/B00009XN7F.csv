Where to begin this review... Okay.. the box.  I looked at the box and the cover art has some ""tomb-raider"" style chick on the front and a cute little one-liner.  I figured okay, what the heck.. I know I'm gonna watch garbage, at least the chick in it will be cute and I can be happy.  Once again I was lied to by souped-up cover art.  The woman depicted on the front of this DVD NEVER APPEARS IN THE MOVIE!!! So let's cut to the chase... the cast of characters are all porn stars who tried to make a 71 minute (yes, you read right 71 minute) movie that had just enough plot to make it too boring as a porn flick.  That's right folks, this is a ""porn trying to be a 'real movie'/crossover"" flick and its just horrible.  This is the kinda crap Cinemax runs at midnight on weekends to draw the under 18 crowd to watch when mommy and daddy aren't around. (simulated sex scenes and worthless (...) shoots)  The plot is dumb (cops trying to 'bust s brothel where the big clients are ""drug dealers""') but once you see how poorely its executed you'll understan my comments.  Since the director knew his actors/actresses can't act worth a crap unless hardore sex is involved we are treated to long shots of people walking up stairs, out doors and setting up equipment with no dialogue whatsoever.  Pure fun! I actually used a ""free rental coupon"" on this thing and feel ripped off... does that draw the picture I want... yeah.. I think it does.",1100390400,2,1500,4.344086021505376
7993962,1,B00009XN7F,"This movie is terrible.  It does not even have the lady on the cover in the movie.  I mean, this is supposed to be a sexy movie but there is little that is sexy about it.  The actors are unattractive and, well, flat.  Do not waste your time.",1077494400,3,241,3.9583333333333335
7993963,1,B00009XN7F,"This movie deserves no stars at all...One was the least I could give it, so be it. This movie has the worst acting, story line,
and directing effort I have ever seen. The ""story"" involves 2 cops trying to catch a bad guy (by monitoring his moves)in a house of prostitution--the characters have a classier term for the house, but who cares. That leads to eavesdropping, voyeurism, and the worst acting and dialogue ever!! There's nudity and other adult ""stuff"", but trust me...the actors aren't even that good looking at all!! And the movie is only about 1 hour and 15 minutes long!! Avoid this trash at all costs. This movie is not worth the DVD it's recorded on.",1067299200,2,663,4.579831932773109
