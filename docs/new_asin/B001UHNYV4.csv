8343785,3,B001UHNYV4,"As a historian who has written my own creative non-fiction biography of Queen Elizabeth Tudor, I had naturally heard of this programme.  Unlike many presented by Dr. Starkey I've seen, he actually wrote this one as well as presented it.

I liked that actors performed excerpts from period documents.  The visuals on this were also quite good.  But as a resource for someone interested in exploring Tudor history in detail, it is simply not as useful as it is hyped.

The idea of Mind of A Tyrant is to present new information we don't know.  The main portion of the programme where this applies is the first of the four episodes in the series which looks at the life of Prince Henry.  In this episode, you see the contrast between the way that heir apparent Prince Arthur was raised compared to Prince Henry.  Henry received important parts of his early childhood education from his mother, Elizabeth of York.  She influenced the young Henry as evidenced by the similarity in their handwriting which the programme allows you to see up close and personal.  So this first episode is useful as I had not seen others exploring the mother-son bond.

But the usefulness ends there, replaced by Starkey's now overt misogyny and dismissive attitude towards women and the role women have played in history.  This attitude not only offends me as a woman and biographical historian focusing primarily on the lives of women, but it greatly skews the data presented in the programme.  Women barely receive any mention in the reign of King Henry VIII as presented in this programme -- except in the one aspect of vilifying Anne Boleyn and charging her with the reason that Henry became cold, cruel, and vicious in the second half of his reign.  Henry is essentially given a free pass in the programme for his conduct -- if not for the evil Anne he would have ruled as a much better man.  He is also portrayed as a victim to Katherine Howard.

So women are either irrelevant or are demons.  This to me is not the work of a great historian, but a bigoted and misogynous old man who openly regards the study of women's contributions to history with disdain.

Not a programme I would be remotely tempted to watch a second time.",1460937600,,2209,4.649484536082475
8343786,5,B001UHNYV4,"With his incredible perception and analysis, his erudite way with words and his passion for the subject, consummate master historian, David Starkey takes on a journey of exploration, with new perspectives and insight, into the reign of the great tyrant and nation-builder Henry VIII.
Starkey varies his narration from the myriad of libraries and archives where he has diligently researched to the various castles and palaces where Henry played out his power, lusts and whims. As well as dialogue from a range of actors.
The first part explores Henry's childhood, his education and his closeness to his mother Elizabeth of York and his sisters. It explores the possible early reasons for his megalomania and lust for grandeur.

The series focuses on Henry's chief ministers (who if they displeased him did not fare better than his wives) , his intellectual development and friendship with the Dutch theologian Erasmus, his cruel suppression of any dissent from the English people: the cruel punishments of rebellions involved torture and execution of a part of the population. The story of his wives, covered more fully in the documentary by Starkey&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wives-of-Henry-VIII/dp/B00006L91Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wives of Henry VIII</a>&nbsp;here gives some focus to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn (who we see being led to her execution played by an attractive actress by the name of Sophie Hunter who very much resembles Anne Boleyn in her portraits).
The actors who play Henry capture his passion and lust for power, but seem on the thin side for the corpulent monarch. Definitely adds to the understanding of the subject matter for those interested in English history in general and Tudor history in particular.",1374451200,3,1799,5.565693430656935
