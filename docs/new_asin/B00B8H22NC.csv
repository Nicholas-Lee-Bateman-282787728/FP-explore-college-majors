The high mountain valley of Jackson Hole, Wyoming is at the center of a 500-square-mile study area, in which researchers estimate there are eight mountain lions, and which is surrounded by 20 million acres of rugged wilderness that also has one of the largest elk herds, grizzly bears, wolves, deer, and bighorn sheep.  A young female mountain lion, who will later be known as F-51, is captured and made unconscious for forty-five minutes, during which her heart rate, breathing, and body temperature are monitored as a tracking collar is placed around her neck, and she becomes the focus for many scenes in the documentary.  A camera placed near an elk carcass shows F-51 feeding in the night and that her head and neck instantly tense to upright attention in response to wolves howling in the distance; the camera also shows that mountain lions eat the richest organs of the liver and heart first and then consume blood, which is over eighty percent water.  Unlike female mountain lions who run away from the researchers, the 175-pound male mountain lion known as M-21 maintains his position in a tree to show his dominance as the researchers use two tranquilizer darts to capture him for a new tracking collar.  Because I saw a mountain lion making a long jump downward from a tree in evading the tracking dogs, I vaguely remember reading that mountain lions can have a downward jump of 60 feet.  The female mountain lion known as F-47 is shown fluidly bounding up a rocky slope in falling snow, and when researchers attempt to find her den using her tracking signal, she is still able to easily evade them -- the researchers also fail to locate her two kittens, one of which was filmed feeding at night and making birdlike chirping calls to her mother.  The documentary features a faint sound that is described as the mating scream of a female mountain lion, and I remember reading that there was a controversy in the past about whether mountain lions screamed.  F-51 and M-21 are shown having sexual union, which they have as many as fifty or more times a day, and the mountain lion's gestation period is 92 days.  The female mountain lion known as F-109, whose collar carries three years of tracking information, leads the researchers on a vigorous chase through various trees until Boone Smith makes a hazardous climb up a tall tree to secure her and lower her down to the researchers on the ground -- although I dislike seeing tracking collars on wild animals, I appreciated learning that F-109's new collar would after two years automatically fall off and that she would never be captured again.  In a rainforestlike alder and willow thicket, Boone locates the den of F-51 when she is away in daylight and sees in a hollow network of limbs and roots two mountain lion kittens.
