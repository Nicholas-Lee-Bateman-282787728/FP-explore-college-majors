7922764,5,B00004TJK6,"This video has it all. Two inspiring Dragon Tunes, and 3 episodes of ""Never-say-die"" action. Never mind that ""A Feat on her Feet"" has Cassie singing a parody of Jingle Bells...The other two stories on the tape are nursery-rhyme-parody free (with only a short stint of the original lyrics of ""Ring-a-round-the-rosie"" in ""Zak takes a dive"", and only the first 5 words to the song ""Rain, rain, go away"" in ""A liking to biking"" (the song was promply interrupted by Max exclaiming ""And don't come back!""). And you also get a good laugh out of ""A Liking for biking"", which is a must watch if you want to understand one part of ""A Feat on her Feet"", when Max makes a comment that links to ""A Liking for Biking"". If you must get a Dragon Tales video, get this one! You won't be disappointed!",1022976000,4,783,4.444444444444445
7922765,5,B00004TJK6,"Playful. Delightful collection of stories, songs, kind characters. Shows friends being supportive and positive as younger characters learn new skills. Presented in segments with breaks in between that allow the kids to dance and sing.  Ages 2-5.",1000339200,,245,5.621621621621622
7922766,4,B00004TJK6,My brother loves this show and watches it everyday.  I've seen this episode with my brother a couple of times and I think it is really educational.  The concept of using dragons who are usually asociated with  fire and warfare to teach kids good lessons is fantastic.  it works too!  My brother has learned many things from Dragon Tales.  Dragon tales is also  good for kids who want something besides Barney.  This video would make a  great gift.,963964800,10,447,4.628205128205129
