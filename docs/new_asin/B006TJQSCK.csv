8504008,5,B006TJQSCK,This coincides perfectly with an ukulele class I'm taking.  Several others in the class have also bought it. I'm glad I found it.,1395446400,2,129,4.608695652173913
8504009,5,B006TJQSCK,"I have a closed head injury form 2012 and am enjoying this basic 'uke learn- like- I- want- to- at- my- own- pace. I have a lot to learn, but the 'uke is the sound of my home that I miss, so it is important to me to learn the 'ukulele. It also is helping my brain heal and connect in amazing ways. My memory is much better now and still getting better. Music heals! I can practice this easily as it is organized just right and not over my head as a beginner.
Looking forward to the second one when I am ready.",1375142400,4,509,3.9038461538461537
8504010,5,B006TJQSCK,"I am a beginner and this helps to put the keys, chords, in simple terms.  Just wish the menu was a little more refined.  Also if it came with a chord chart to practice without the video.  Can't remember the fingering for the chords once I finish watching the DVD.  Overall, very pleased with the DVD.",1356048000,4,300,4.303571428571429
