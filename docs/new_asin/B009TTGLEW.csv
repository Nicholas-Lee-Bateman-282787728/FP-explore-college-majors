5368428,5,B009TTGLEW,"kids love this and anything at all on this same line/series.  I personally love that there are no annoying voices, etc in any of them---good use of vocabulary, good use of ""manners""...really, this movie models a lot that young ladies need to learn...kids are 2 and 5, if that helps.",1372723200,3,282,4.64
5368429,5,B009TTGLEW,"This DVD remind me of the old 1980s Hands Across the World project as this video teaches both dances, songs and music from different cultures around the globe in a fun way. One can do a Iris jig or a Chinese dragon dance for example.  While from Japanese anime I had heard of Children Day in Japan I didn't know before the episode provided on this DVD that Children Day was practice in other countries too.  The video also include karaoke music videos one can sing along to.",1360886400,4,474,4.375
5368430,5,B009TTGLEW,"This one is especially fun and educational.  It even has simple phrases in other languages, such as France and Spanish.  It also talks about songs in France, food in France, Children's day in Japan, etc.  It's a really good way to open up your little one's world to other parts of the country and could stir up and curiosity to learn another language!  Would recommend it to anyone!",1360540800,,382,4.573529411764706
5368431,5,B009TTGLEW,"My boys have a soft spot for Angelina Ballerina and dancing.  This is a great DVD because it shows off International dancing which is great to teach kids about.  Angelina and friends all have fun while performing and watching the different dances, and I felt this DVD wasn't as much into competition but rather having fun.  There is no main star or trophy but rather everyone performs.  This is actually probably my favorite Angelina Ballerina DVD.",1359331200,,448,4.855263157894737

""Angelina Ballerina: Dance Around The World""
(HIT Entertainment, 2012)
------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the charming picturebook series by Katharine Holabird and illustrator Helen Craig, the ""Angelina Ballerina"" cartoon series tracks the adventures of a bright-eyed, ever-enthusiastic mouse-girl with a singular focus on dancing and a fondness for pink clothing. In ""Dance Around The World,"" Angelina explores various dance traditions from outside the ballet and American dance that she usually works in - episodes center on Irish, French and Asian styles, with music that matches each style.

This DVD is part of the second series of Angelina cartoons, the computer-animated ""New Steps"" adventures.  While I'm not fond of the animation style (which is even further away from Helen Craig's original delightful artwork) I did notice that the stories place less emphasis on competition than the first series, and more on cooperative problem-solving, which I liked. Angelina Ballerina fans will like this one, and dance teachers may also find it useful as a way to introduce new styles to younger students.
