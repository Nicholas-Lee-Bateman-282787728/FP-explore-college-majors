8758330,5,B01ECKPGUW,"I've always thought of Bruce Molsky as a world-class old-time fiddler--and that he is. The fiddle tracks on this CD-DVD set are wonderful. But I have to say, the banjo, guitar, and song tracks are my favorites. If you're new to Mr. Molsky's music or to old-time music in general, this set would make a varied introduction that's sure to please. And if you're not, then I don't need to tell you what a must-have it is. :)",1480291200,,420,4.397435897435898

8758334,5,B01ECKPGUW,"A career that spans over 40 years, and Bruce just gets better and better...but not in a classic wine way, more like an aged bottle of American whisky, still raw and uncompromising, yet smooth as heck when you sip it.  A personal showcase of this man's considerable talent is on display here in this set; soulful fiddle, driving banjo, trance like songs, and some fine fingerpicked geetar.  A DVD and CD package, along with extensive liner notes and some real cool folk art...old school packing and bad-a** playing...seems that's what's going on at the Old-Time Tiki Parlour.  If you like old-time fiddle music, this is a must have title...",1471996800,,639,4.844036697247707

8758336,5,B01ECKPGUW,"I've waited 20 years for something like this. When I heard there was a new Molsky release in the works I was excited since it's been a few years since his last solo CD. I've been a crazy fan of Bruce's for decades. When I found out that traditional musician/producer/superman David Bragger was producing a full blown CD & DVD set of Bruce, I almost fainted. I pre-ordered it through the Old Time Tiki Parlour and I can't stop listening to it and watching it. It is an intimate production of the highest order. It's like Bruce is playing a special concert just for you. Not only is there a ton of fiddle, but Bruce let's loose with songs, fingerpicking guitar and the coolest hypnotic banjo songs. I hope they make another!

Bottom Line: Buy this set now! If you see any release by Bruce or the Tiki Parlour get 'em too. This is best living traditional music on the planet.",1464739200,,872,4.416149068322981
8758337,5,B01ECKPGUW,"The Master is in the Parlor! One of the finest old-time musicians of modern times recorded in the beautiful, retro, intimate setting of the Old-Time Tiki Parlour studio. It's both a CD and a DVD Set. It's like you're sitting in front of Bruce for an hour as he weaves together the most beautiful musical tapestry you've ever heard. I've always loved his fiddling, but through David Bragger's eyes and ears, you'll get entranced by Molsky's banjo, fingerpicking guitar and vocals too. It's so mesmerizing and important, they should send a copy out into space to live on forever!",1463961600,,577,4.838383838383838
