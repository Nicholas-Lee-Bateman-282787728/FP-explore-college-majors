8210907,4,B000TTLYTI,"I found that this product was as described, with both Spanish and English subtitles and the original Norwegian dialogue. The cover was entirely Spanish, as were the menus, which was a little confusing but not too much of an issue. At times, however, the subtitles were not correctly synchronised with the speech. This was the main issue I had with the product. Other than this, I was happy with what I received.",1292025600,2,411,4.722222222222222
8210908,4,B000TTLYTI,"A young teen girl living in a small town in Norway, receives mystical messages in her mailbox.  She finds out that the deliverer is a street dog, which she follows.  The dog leads her to a mystical man, who takes her through a journey of Europe's big 'thinkers' from Socrates up today and artist eg Sheakespere.  Full of good special effects, and very well played by Silje Storstein and Thomas von Broemsom (who by the way played the uncle in Hallstroem's 'My Life as a Dog').  When i recommend it as family movie, is because a lot of good discussions could come out of it.
Languages in the movie is Norwegian and Swedish, so be prepared to read subtitles.",1252627200,5,656,4.487394957983193
