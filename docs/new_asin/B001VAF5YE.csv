8346001,5,B001VAF5YE,Incredible glider scenes of the Schweitzer 1-26 short... but some great glider flying scenes !  I thought this was supposed to have some clips of the making of the movie But I was wrong !  But still great DVD for anyone's flying library.,1485561600,,237,4.488372093023256
8346002,5,B001VAF5YE,This is a good movie if you like gliders,1420243200,,40,3.5555555555555554
8346003,5,B001VAF5YE,"There is no other video like this about gliders. These two gliders fly combat tactics against each other. There is a sequence where they are casting shadows on a lake and going around trees.

We all know that you never get ""LOW and SLOW"" in a glider.

I guarantee that you will never guess the outcome.",1415577600,,302,4.375
8346004,3,B001VAF5YE,"I was given a VHS copy of this film clip when I retired from the Air Force in 1979.  Now that VHS is no longer in vogue, I wanted a DVD copy.  The copy which you sell is no longer the same quality as the original, it has been copied so many times.  Also, a drama part has been cut out of the center of the video.  It still contains the same terrific flying scenes which are awe inspiring.  Too bad it's not the same quality as the award winning movie.",1379462400,,451,3.912087912087912
8346005,4,B001VAF5YE,This is a classic aviation film.  The new version from Tailwheeler's Journal also has special features AND is the long version.  A great buy.,1318723200,,141,4.833333333333333
8346006,5,B001VAF5YE,"I use to be an instructor at Embry Riddle long time ago 1978 and I would show this to my students on 16 MM film. The Overall movie back then was Excellent in showing one's challenge against one's self. The DVD delivers this message with Great inflight film clips per the original. Quality is VSH on the DVD but very watchable.
So... what is missing are several minutes of old film that built on the idea of the character himself in an I LOVE FLYING ""hangar"" living life style. He slept in an old sailpalne fuselage suspended from the hangar rafters that was his bed. Much more flying.  The push of his thoughts in a love to fly was present and his need to figure it all out against his learning to ""get over his"" level of experience was explored more in the original. THIS film rocked back then and it still carries the same message BUT someone Clipped it's wings and is not showing the original experience. BUt hey after 33 years of trying to find this, it will do. Just wish the rest interested could see the Whole film. Maybe I need to go back to Daytona and explore the film library.
