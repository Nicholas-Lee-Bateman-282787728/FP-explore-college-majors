7909507,5,B00000I1ME,"This is a fun video for all ages but especially for children and teenagers.  It is filled with jokes, laughter, and stunts to learn.  I have had students who had very low self esteem academically but blossomed after learning to juggle with one of the Raspyni brothers.  This video is perfect.  Filled with fun and safe activities that will keep kids busy for hours, days, weeks, years!  Thanks Raspynis!",978566400,,403,4.782608695652174
7909508,5,B00000I1ME,"This tape is an excellent way to learn things that you've always wanted to know how to do! It's fun for both children and adults, and is much cheaper than a babysitter!  Our family watches it all the time.",975542400,,205,4.256410256410256
7909509,4,B00000I1ME,"These two young men have mastered the art of juggling, and demonstrate it in a unique way that is entertaining, educating, and most of all, exciting.  They share their talents with the public in a style that is captivating.  Not only are they master mechanics of the art, but their constant chatter and comedy patter raises the level of their performance to a high level.  This is an all family show! Guaranteed to raise your spirits.",975456000,,434,4.684210526315789
7909510,5,B00000I1ME,"I have had this video for about 2 years.  My son, who is now 5.5 loves it.  He has seen this video about 30 times.  Often, he will say to me, ""Dad, watch!"" as he tries to copy an act of...well...showing off.
This video captures the humor and antics of two professional entertainers using kitchen utensils, food, spinning plates, blow darts and so much more.
This is the kind of video you can put on the VCR after a big holiday meal, when the house if full of random relatives and you'll hear hoots and cheers from the TV room.
This is a fun tape to own, and you might learn a few 'tricks' to show off to your own friends while watching.",975369600,,636,4.154471544715447
7909511,4,B00000I1ME,"Having seen the World Champion Jugglers (in their price range) on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, on the Howie Mandel Show, and live in Las Vegas with Dennis Miller and Dana Carvey, I got a copy of ""The Art of Showing Off"" for my eleven year old nephew.  In his review -- a thank you note -- he wrote:  ""Uncle Byron, the Raspyni Brothers Rock!""
This is a very good video for children aged 6 through 11.  Barry Friedman and Dan Holzman have an excellent sense for what intrigues and entertains that age group, and they also appeal very strongly to the child in every adult.
The video is structured episodically, with entertaining activities that children can try -- with appropriate supervision!  Adults may not admit it, but I suspect those who view this video spend a lot of ""secret time"" trying some of these things out!
""The Art of Showing Off"" is a fun video to have around, particularly if you find yourself occasionally entertaining nephews, nieces, the neighbors' kids, or your boss's little darlings.  Send 'em home primed!  You'll enjoy it, too.",975369600,,1054,4.6702702702702705
7909512,5,B00000I1ME,"The Raspyni's come up with a fun flurry of fantastic feats! Hats' off to the champion ""Juggler Boys"" for balancing all sorts of tricks with humor. Perfect appeal for the performer of all ages. Our kids are now amateur ""Show Offs"", and have made the family room into a variety theater.  Never have we laughed so hard!",975283200,2,316,4.543859649122807
