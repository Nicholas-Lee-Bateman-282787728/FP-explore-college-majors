3171513,5,B0017DQFA8,"Frank McCourt makes for an exquisite narrator on this stellar tour of the pubs of Dublin. I visited many of them as a youth and his wanderings brought back many a memory. Part of what adds to the viewer's amusement is the recognition of just how much Mr. McCourt is enjoying himself in the process of his travels. It seems that there's nowhere else he'd rather be and the magnitude of his own cheer became contagious. Furthermore, he has done an extensive amount of background research for each segment so his insights into the greater history of Ireland--within the context of its pubs--was quite illuminating. I particularly appreciated the segment on Brendan Behan, the ""drinker with a writing problem."" Overall, The Historic Pubs of Dublin was a treasured diversion.",1230249600,8,770,4.976744186046512

8265784,5,B0017DQFA8,"I have seen this dvd many times.  My fianc&eacute; is from Dublin. Before I took my first trip there with him we watched it. We watch it before each trip there and sometimes when I am going through 'Ireland withdrawal' I will watch it again. The host is wonderful. He will teach you many things about Irish history and be funny and interesting at the same time. During our trip we always take a day to go to the city centre. We go during the day while the pubs are less busy. We pub hop to the many pubs highlighted in this DVD. It is always one of my favorite days in the trip. The pub atmosphere in Ireland is incredible. My favorite so far has been The Long Hall. It is featured in this. It is the only pub we have stayed for multiple pints before heading on to the next place. It is a true gem and Marcus the bar man is delightful to chat with.
