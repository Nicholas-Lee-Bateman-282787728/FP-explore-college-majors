8349575,4,B0021ZMHTE,"In 2075, man dwells in space as well as on the Earth. Space debris has become a dangerous reality. Ai Tanabe is a young lady who has come to space to collect and dispose of this dangerous debris. She meets veteran debris collector, Hoshino. Together with their friends, they keep space travelers and residents safe. As time goes by, the 2 fall in love with each other. It's harder to do a dangerous job with the one you love waiting and praying for your safety.

This anime is really good. It has action, drama, comedy, Sci-fi/adventure, and a bit of romance. It's pretty stacked. The animation and voice actors are good as well. I'm really surprised that this anime isn't more well known. The 1 thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the depth of the story. The story backgrounds the characters well, but there is a little too much wasted time on goofiness I think. If that time were used to develop the romance between Ai and Hoshino more, This series could have been incredible. This series does have a very satisfying ending though. Overall, this anime is a joy to watch. I highly recommend it to anime fans of any genre.",1354406400,6,1140,4.480769230769231
