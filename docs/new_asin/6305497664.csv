1038616,1,6305497664,The movie story itself is great. But the poor video quality made it difficult to watch. The sound was off most the time and the video had a reddish/orange tint the second half. The DVD stops at a certain point about 3/4 the way into the movie and just freezes. VERY BAD COPY!!! No English subtitles for the scenes in another language.,1122249600,19,334,4.403225806451613
1038617,4,6305497664,"Tesla's life and history was greate and strange. Personally I felt that this video could be better. I don't understand Tesla native's lenguage and used english weren't very clear for a video intented for sale worldwide. Any way, every thing about Tesla is interesting.",1001203200,4,268,5.113636363636363
1038618,3,6305497664,"This version of the 1980 Zagreb film production is altered from its original form.  A ""new-age"" introduction featuring a rotund Priestess presiding over a wedding and some interview excerpts with a few psuedo-science quacks spoils the openning. The original Serb language introduction and other Serb language scenes do not have subtitles as in the earlier US release prints. There has also been some reorganization of footage which doesn't improve any aspect of the film. ""UFO Films"" who now control the distribution rights should be condemned for this travesty. The original was a modest but successful first attempt at a biographical film about Tesla. It certainly won't be too long before some hopefully capable filmmaker revisits the subject.",976924800,38,746,5.3760683760683765
1038619,5,6305497664,"""The Secret of Nikola Tesla"" is a film about a man that was so far beyond his time in the field of electronics that people today still haven't understood what impact his discoveries have on their lives today.  Things in this world would be radically different if Tesla was allowed to  complete his work. In this video, you will get a feel for the passion and  incredible intellect that Tesla possessed. Don't be surprised if you get a  little ""peeved"" after finding out that many of our world's  problems have already been answered, but because of the ""Almighty  Dollar"" our welbeing has been neglected. Tesla forsaw all of it. This  film is a must for everyone. We can learn from history, and this film  details important little known facts. Though it is not perfect in it's  portrayal, ""The Secret of Nikola Tesla"" stands as a landmark  film...it's well worth your time to view it.",963792000,12,883,4.675324675324675

7890464,5,6305497664,I loved the movie.  I wish there were subtitles for certain parts but I still understood what was going on without any problem.  Defiantly worth watching.  Tesla's the genius nobody's heard of.  He's still ahead of us today.,1362960000,,224,4.815789473684211
7890465,5,6305497664,"everyone should see this movie just to know who Tesla was and his contributions and to also know about Edison and how he tried to control everything.
Tesla has so many patents and discovered so much about things in his time that we are using today, even before there was a use for it in his time.
if it wasn't for corporate greed things would be alot different now because of his ideas.
yes its a poor quality video, but its the only thing available, seems a copy of the videotape made to dvd.
but at least its available, and rather complain about the quality, be thankful we can still get this valuable story.",1262822400,,610,4.359649122807017
7890466,5,6305497664,"Great information on the man who was/made the 20th Century. If certain entities would allow Tesla's work to be made public there would be few if any issues regarding fuel, climate and energy. Tesla was so far ahead of his time he was considered out of step with the main stream. Unfortunately the ""main stream"" is not about serving man or the Earth. Tesla knew the we live in an electrical Universe therefore, everything including the human is electrical or an extension of the Source. Science promotes chemicals as the key elements for life yet they cannot prove one chemical element within the Atom only electricity.",1259884800,,618,4.839622641509434
7890467,5,6305497664,received this item without any problems or issues. We appreciate it.,1179187200,,68,5.2727272727272725
7890468,1,6305497664,"No Stars if I could.  The information may be interesting but the production quality of this DVD was so bad that I had a headache at 9:00 minutes into this thing.

Not worth anyones money ... If you are curious for a little personal torture then rent it from Netflix!",1160179200,5,266,4.3
7890469,1,6305497664,"I must echo the others here, that the DVD transfer is TERRIBLE!!  The sound is like it has gone through a heavy-metal band guitar distortion-booster, and it does indeed ""freeze, back-up and rewind"" somewhere in the middle.  What a shame!",1155081600,7,237,4.9
7890470,4,6305497664,"English subtitled and a bit flawed in

transfer, but should be seen at least

once by all Americans, while we still

have freedom of choice and can get pa-

tents! Many, like Rudy Gundermann, the

austrian-Amer-I-can, got screwed out of

their dues by greedy corporate types.

Only Mike Brown and a handful of other

Independent Amre-I-cans inventors left

...Where will the next generation of

them come from. I contend that the

'Greatest Generation' is the one that

accomplishes the most, much to Tom

Brokaw's flawed 'greatest generation'!",1151798400,2,544,5.114942528735632
7890471,3,6305497664,"All of the other reviews have already touched on the subject of the flawed transfer of this terrific story detailing a handful of significant events in the life of the ever elusive Nikolai Tesla, but, in perfect honesty, it is worth noting once again: this transfer's audio and video quality are atrocious, with the sound alternating between 'tinny' and 'bass' and the picture flickering with what appears to be a horrible video original.  Tesla has always been a subject gravitating between 'myth' and 'legend,' and, while this screenplay does try to do some justice to the man's life pursuits, it chalks up much of his discoveries as unexplainable inspiration -- fleeting fancies of genius never explored or understood.  There's always far more to genius than that (as one could surmise from Tesla and Thomas A. Edison's disagreements), but, unfortunately, this story doesn't offer much.  Also, the film's sole explanation provided by the character of Tesla is, sadly, presented in German ... WITH NO SUBTITLES FOR THOSE OF US WHO CAN'T SPEAK IT!  The film's greatest strength is presenting Tesla as a subject who deserves greater study; besides that, RENT it, if you can find it, and don't make the investment.  A better transfer would be necessary to justify this purchase price.",1148860800,15,1283,5.061611374407583
7890472,1,6305497664,"I had to try three different DVD players just to get my copy to load. When it did, there were many pauses with very poor video and audio quality. I think marketing something of this ""non-quality"" for $26.99 is just short of criminal!",1138147200,12,233,4.441860465116279
