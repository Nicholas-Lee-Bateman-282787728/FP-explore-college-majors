4522406,4,B0051GOB7Q,"I don't do games so I had no expectations about this SYFY made for TV movie.
 I was pleasantly surprised. A solid cast with better than average performances, not that it's perfect by any means.
 Some of the situations were less than believable such as how easy everyone seemed to be able to get by everyone else's  security. I thought the action was well done and the hand to hand fighting was good. The CGI special effects
was better than most SYFY channel movies.
 As the previous reviewer stated it was more family drama and not action thriller which was a good change of pace considering most syfy/fantasy movies rely overly much on action and constant gun battles and explosions. I thought it had a good balance. I don't know how it would work for a series as I stated I don't do games and so I don't know anything about what enemies these new Martians would have other than Earthers.
 The one big disappointment was Robert Patrick wouldn't be around for a series. I have always like him and he was commendable as the war hero turned alcoholic who redeems himself. I guess he doesn't want to get stuck in a regular series after XFILES. Too bad.
 Well, there it is. As my title indicates, this movie is not for gamers who will do nothing but malign it and throw insults even though from the first news of this it was clear it had nothing to do with the games.
 I'm pre-ordering right now. i don't know if there will be any extras or additional scenes but I'll settle for what I saw  and be happy to watch it over , several times I'm sure.",1307491200,11,1542,4.3671328671328675

4522418,5,B0051GOB7Q,Very impressive,1412467200,,15,7.0
4522419,3,B0051GOB7Q,I saw this on the scifi channel  and liked it.  I've  watched it a few times since i've gotten it from amazon  and i'll probably see it a few more times.  Its just a typical scifi geek movie.  I like the actors  the characters they play and the story line. For the budget  this movie was made on it wasn't bad.  Actually i liked it better than Doom  (which had a bigger budget  and  known actors).  Its about  different factions of people living on mars in the future who don't get along  and a young man trying to find his sister who was kidnapped when he was a child . Everyone tells him shes dead and he won't give up looking for her.  Its a take off of a game and i think they did an o.k. job with it.,1398470400,,705,3.9285714285714284
4522420,4,B0051GOB7Q,"While looking for new video's to watch, I came across ""Red Faction"" .  It was a movie that I had not watched nor had I seen advertised.  The cover looked good and the description was promising.  The movie was not epic, nor Oscar material, but it was a good solid science fiction movie.  Looked a bit low budget but it was very entertaining.  I would recommend this film to fans of the genre. You will recognize some familiar faces.",1395446400,,431,4.405063291139241
4522421,4,B0051GOB7Q,"i  wish  to report  that  there  is  nothing  to  report.
the  filming  was  well  done ,  the  acting  was  good  ,  the  story was  unremarkable  in  either  being  stupid  or  brilliant .

it  is  a good  saterday  evening  science fiction  movie.",1392422400,,250,4.317073170731708
4522422,5,B0051GOB7Q,Definitely not a B movie. The special effects were top notch and the plot was well written and easy to follow. Great acting too...,1391904000,,130,4.458333333333333
4522423,5,B0051GOB7Q,"SyFy Channel usually airs crappy movies like Sharknado on Saturday nights but once in a while they put more money into making a movie and it turns out to be really, really good. Red Faction is a very good movie. This movie will surprise you in how well it is made for just being on TV and never in the movie theaters. It is not as good as Star Wars or Star Trek, but for a ""made for television movie"", this really kicks rear end!",1390262400,,429,4.0588235294117645
4522424,3,B0051GOB7Q,"I enjoyed the storyline, it had some good and some okay acting, but the overall story was sensible and plausible. Set on Mars in the future was a good move and the technology was not too outlandish! Worth paying to watch.",1385856000,,221,4.414634146341464
4522425,3,B0051GOB7Q,.I hate these long reviewes  just get to the point did it get there and was it as shown works great and ad shown,1379980800,,112,3.6666666666666665
4522426,5,B0051GOB7Q,It was awesome if u r a faction fan a definate must see very good script and well done some parts are slightly cheesy but overall loved it,1377129600,,138,3.9642857142857144
4522437,2,B0051GOB7Q,Wasn't sure what to expect with this one but still a major disappointment. Think I quit watching at the half way mark.,1373932800,,118,4.409090909090909
4522438,5,B0051GOB7Q,I like it but it's not the game that I play on my PC. but the story line is great and the effects are nice. It was worth it.,1371945600,,124,3.310344827586207
4522439,4,B0051GOB7Q,The four stars I gave it is a compromise between the five star made for tv rating and the 3 star overall rating. This tells the story of the Mason son in between Red Faction and the fun yet ill-fated Red Faction Armageddon video games. The story is good and they make good use of there tiny budget. Red Faction fans are likely to enjoy this but there mysterious lack of the nano-forge is a loss for the presentation and plot. In the end I'm glad I watched it.,1371340800,2,459,4.168539325842697
4522440,5,B0051GOB7Q,Brian J Smith is a great young actor. Loved him in Stargate Universe as Lt Scott.  I recommend this movie,1369872000,,105,4.25
4522441,3,B0051GOB7Q,"Children, a brother and a sister are separated and thought dead by one another during the revolution.  25 yrs. later they are adversaries and find each other during a fight between sworn enemies. Side kick Terran very funny.",1368748800,2,224,4.894736842105263
4522442,3,B0051GOB7Q,"I've beat the games and found the movie lacking something. I know it was a low budget film, but it could've been better. More/better action!",1368748800,,140,4.64
4522443,5,B0051GOB7Q,I'm a big science fiction fan when it comes to movies. I couldn't pass up buying this movie based on the game  especially when I received it for a great price,1367798400,,158,4.096774193548387
4522444,5,B0051GOB7Q,"I was sort of familiar with the game, but after finding and watching this movie I will find out more about it. Good cast, good special FX, just a good movie! It would be great for some sequels or at least a prequel, or a TV series.",1365811200,,231,3.9361702127659575
4522445,3,B0051GOB7Q,"Some cheesy special effects and some predictable plot elements, but still entertaining at these prices. Given that it was made from the back-story for a video game, a worthy effort.",1364860800,,181,5.066666666666666
4522446,4,B0051GOB7Q,"I'm familiar with this series of games but it's not really necessary for the purposes of watching this movie.  I believe this character set is based on red faction guerilla and the story taking place after that game.  Anyway, it's watchable low budget sci-fi with some decent action sequence and a serviceable storyline (that tends to reflect the budget which means a lot of ""inside a building"" scenes).  Altogether it looks good and is well acted (except the daughter part; she has a british accent ON MARS!  The son has a brooklyn accent (I suppose) though it's not as distracting as the british one); the story moves along at a good clip.

Problems:
It's just not that great a story (like most of these b movies).
Effects/cgi aren't great.
There are ""dead spots"" (black for a second or two) from where they cut to commercial (apparently) left in the movie; slightly annoying but not a movie killer.

I watch a lot of b-movies, this is not a bad B movie.  If you're expecting a theater quality movie you're not going to like it.",1363478400,,1030,4.595628415300546
4522457,5,B0051GOB7Q,"I have watched a ton of video game inspired movies and most of them are just shoot 'em ups, have crappy CGI footage of aliens and spaceships, or have no story at all.

Red Faction Origins is one of the better video game movies I have seen.  There is actually a story line involved, albeit a little easy to see coming, but a story nonetheless.  This is one of the few SyFy production movies I am going to buy on DVD.

If you have played the games it will help you understand who the basic characters are.  If you haven't played the games don't worry about; the movie explains plenty to know who everyone is.

BOTTOM LINE: A well above average production of a video game movie, with good acting, good characterization and a good story line.  You shouldn't be disappointed.",1360108800,,770,4.418439716312057
4522458,3,B0051GOB7Q,"Not the best movie out and let's your mind drift to other places at times, but for the most part - enjoyable.",1356307200,,109,4.0
4522459,4,B0051GOB7Q,"It's the cheese wiz of science fiction, but extremely well done for the genre. The actors sometimes pose comic book style like statues because there is no time for subtlety with the nonstop racing plot. If you like a good fast paced Flash Gordon serial this is the state of the art today.",1355961600,,288,4.452830188679245
4522460,3,B0051GOB7Q,I don't remember watching this but the games are great. 3 stars is all I can give it. It may be spectacular or it might suck.,1351036800,,125,3.8461538461538463
4522461,2,B0051GOB7Q,"sort of rambles through a plot, not really entertaining considering the actors were better than the script or director. They had to dumb down considering the roles I've seen them do in other films.",1348963200,,197,4.823529411764706
4522462,2,B0051GOB7Q,"This is a low-budget  science fiction movie. The story has some interesting parts but nothing, particularly good. I will say that it did not drag out but kept my interest going.

However, without a particularly good story what movie need are good acting, special effects and filming.

Here what let is down to me was much of the acting. Very poor I thought. The only one I thought who did a good job was Robert Patrick.

The special effects were poor, the filming poor but adequate.

Overall nothing much",1343174400,,504,4.617977528089888
4522463,4,B0051GOB7Q,Enyoyed the simple but fast moving storyline where the main character looks for his long lost sister. A pleasant looking hero and an interesting sidekick coupled with witty comments certainly helped. It would be interesting to see whether a part 2.,1342742400,,248,5.073170731707317
4522464,4,B0051GOB7Q,"Story line and the scenary was pretty good.  I'm glad I purchased it.  Come on Syfy channel, make more interesting sci-fi pics! Come back to life.",1319068800,,146,4.576923076923077
4522465,5,B0051GOB7Q,"Let's face it, videogame movie adaptions have been pretty abysmal. I can give a whole list of movies that, although I might like them as movies, were just plain awful for videogame movie adaptions(Doom, Bloodrayne, House of the Dead, Resident Evil, just to name a few). Some of those movies have went on to have sequels even though, for the most part, those movies blew chunks. Out of all the movies I've ever seen, Red Faction: Origins is one of those rare gems that gets it right(most of the time, anyways).

The story centers around Jake Mason (Brian J. Smith), the last surviving son of Martian freedom fighter Alec Mason (Robert Patrick). It picks up some 12 years after Alec helps the Martians win their independence from the Earth Defense Force. Jake serves as an Officer in the Red Faction Militia and that's where your story begins. It's set between the events of Red Faction: Guerrilla and Red Faction: Armageddon(the games) and stays true to the overall storyline.

I'll admit, the low-budget special effects doesn't help this movie too much. SyFy is notorious for them in their movies. Course, I don't think big-budget ones would have either. This movies centers more on story and that's alright by me.

Direction by Michael Nankin, of Battlestar Galactica fame is a plus. I really enjoyed the movie and hope they followup with another one.",1315353600,2,1352,4.8441558441558445
4522466,1,B0051GOB7Q,"As with so many SyFy movies, this one is lousy.  Its sole purpose is to get game players to buy the video game. Unless you are that interested in the video game, save your money.",1313107200,,178,4.085714285714285

8452691,5,B0051GOB7Q,"I was surprised! It was actually good. I have not played the video game in years, but after watching this movie I feel like it is time to dust off the old original xbox in the garage and play this again! Best low budget movie I have seen in  while.",1469145600,,248,3.96
8452692,5,B0051GOB7Q,Enjoyable to watch.,1457740800,,19,5.666666666666667
8452693,3,B0051GOB7Q,Movie was okay.  The lead character Brian J. Smith carried the whole movie.  It could have been much better if there were more actors like him.,1438992000,,143,4.461538461538462

8452697,3,B0051GOB7Q,"I'll start by saying I never played any of the source material though I happily identify as a gamer. The film does a decent job involving the unfamiliar audience member (me), and keeps things going at a decent pace. One of the main failings is that while the audience is given enough information to understand that A leads to B and B leads to C so the plot makes sense there's not enough world building around A, B, and C to make the audience care.

I suspect this was intended as a backdoor pilot for a potential series (it certainly ends that way) and I have to admit I would have really enjoyed seeing the world fleshed out a bit more. Can't comment as a fan of the series but as a well versed SF geek and gamer it was a fun way to while away an afternoon. I'd recommend renting over buying.",1424044800,,794,4.189542483660131
