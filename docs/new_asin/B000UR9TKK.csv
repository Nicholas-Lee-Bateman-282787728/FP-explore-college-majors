2923975,5,B000UR9TKK,We LOVE this series!  Amazon had the best price by over $100.  Definitely would buy it again!,1197072000,5,93,4.411764705882353
2923976,5,B000UR9TKK,"If you like Raymond, this is the ultimate. I never get tired of watching this show! It's a show I can watch over & over without it getting old. Plus there's a lot of good commentaries.",1196467200,4,184,4.138888888888889
2923977,5,B000UR9TKK,"I just got my house and it's great!  Most who are interested in this set probably already know each of the 210 episodes by heart, so I'll describe the packaging. It looks so cute on display.  The roof lifts up to reveal the nine cases for each season.  They look like minis of the individual season cases with sturdy covers that open up like books. They are set in the house at different heights so they are easy to pull out.  Inside there is the episode list and photos like with the individual seasons.  The discs are in cardboard sleeves that have a photo of one of the 5 main characters with two quotes.  I know a lot of people are concerned about the cardboard sleeves scratching the discs. I will admit, they do fit rather tightly in the sleeves, but each sleeve has a paper backing that seems to protect the disc from scratches.  I have not noticed scratches on the ones I've pulled out so far but, I haven't played these discs enough yet to really test it.

What I really like about the box set, besides it being so cute, is that it takes up less room than those big, bulky individual season sets.  It takes up a little more than six individual seasons worth, so that frees up a lot of space in my cabinet.  The discs have the same extras as the individuals seasons, plus you also get a book with the shooting script for ""The Finale.""  The autographs of the writers are facsimiles on the cover.  If the discs hold up (I've heard of disc protectors you can snap on called ""D-Skins,"" but I'm not sure they will fit with this setup) and with the reasonable price you can get this for on Amazon right now, I see no reason to keep those bulky individual sets, so up for sale they go!",1196208000,106,1686,4.267295597484277
2923978,5,B000UR9TKK,"its finally here the perfect gift for any raymond fan. this show was awsome and the bonus features  are awsome as well. this is a christmas gift for my mother and im sure she will love it just as much she just cant get enough of watching the repeats on tv, and now she can pick and choose which ones she wants to watch, cant get any better than that.",1195516800,4,350,4.0
2923979,5,B000UR9TKK,"I live in England and Pre Ordered the item when it was around $200 which is around 100, by the time it was released it was only $150 which is 75. I saved 25. This is a must buy if you don't already own all the seasons and are a fan of the show.
The delivery was so fast as well because i live in England the Estimated Arrival Date was 14th - 19th of November but it arrived on the 6th!",1194220800,10,385,3.707317073170732
2923980,5,B000UR9TKK,"Probably not, if you're even visiting this Amazon page in the first place. As a widespread array of popular television shows are planning to release their final season DVD sets by the end of 2007 (""Full House,"" ""Gilmore Girls,"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" to name a few), they have all taken a similar path by releasing deluxe full-series collections at the same time. That, right there, is a currently growing trend that you can expect to find with every future television show that is being manufactured on DVD. When popular shows like this one reach the point where their final season is ready for release, the DVD companies must do something to keep their profits rolling. In order to reel in even the consumers who have already purchased the previous seasons, there is only one thing left to do: design some super-fancy packaging, promise a few little surprise bonuses that do not come with the original DVD's, produce a ""Complete Series"" set, and slap a $200 list price on it. After all, there is a slew of dedicated ""Raymond"" fans in the world, and for many of them, something like this is difficult to pass up.

Now that we are all starting to see how many shows are going for the complete series appeal, we can learn to know better than to impulsively buy the individual seasons as they are pumped out--that is, if we care enough about the bigger and the better. It's a matter of preference, I guess, but I have always liked the packaging that ""Raymond"" has used for the DVD's. It's sturdy, the discs are easily accessible, and unlike the original ""Sex and the City"" packaging, it doesn't just fall apart the minute you take off the shrink wrap. For that reason, I will stick with what I have and look forward to September 19, when Season 9 officially arrives.

However, if this set looks ideal to you, or if you love the show and would like to start collecting the DVD's, be prepared to shell out a good $200. These special editions look great, but they sure don't come cheap. Still, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is simply one of those contemporary classics that is worth every penny, and if you're looking for something with a solid, consistent blend of hilarity and poignancy, this absolutely fits the bill. The show began as slighty sluggish, yet brimming with potential, and the basic plot was easy for viewers to tap into. You've got the protagonist Ray Barone, a sportswriter who mostly lives up to the title of the series, but he often has a hard time pleasing his wife, his kids, his parents (who so conveniently reside right across the street), and his perpetually jealous younger brother all at once. The show was initially designed to take some universal conflicts within families, place a humorous spin on them, and perhaps prompt viewers to realize that maybe their own scenarios aren't quite so bad. Although the plot always attempts to (and typically succeeds at) depicting the reality of marriage and family life, they sometimes steer a little too far off the deep end, but that's the fun of the writing. The marital snits between Ray and Debra, Frank and Marie, and Robert and Amy are always interesting to watch, and the laughter comes just as naturally as the cringing when you observe Marie's perpetual hold on her husband, her grown sons, and her daughters-in-law. The majority of women will easily identify with Debra's frustrations against her occasionally selfish significant other, as well as Frank and Marie's apparent lack of understanding about a concept known as ""ringing the doorbell when you visit your son's home."" Robert's nonstop efforts to be noticed and achieve a rare edge over the lovable little brother ""Raymie"" (even if it's only for a few minutes) blends humor with sympathy for his character, and it's virtually impossible to keep a straight face whenever Frank blurts out one of his brilliantly scripted punch lines (""Holy crap!"") Can you ask for comedy that is any better than that? After watching just a few episodes (particularly those from Seasons 4-9), it's easy to see why this has been labeled as ""the sitcom of our times.""

Then there are the three Barone kids, who don't take much precedence in the show, but are still worth mentioning. Ray Romano and series creator Phil Rosenthal always believed strongly in keeping the kids' screen time short and sweet, for the sake of preventing their series from sharing a similar category with shows like ""Full House."" Without the cutesy dialogue and professionally written, Olsen twin-style catch phrases that no real kid would ever even understand, oldest daughter Ally and twin sons Geoffrey and Michael succeeded in being a pleasure without being overused. Real-life siblings Madylin, Sawyer and Sullivan Sweeten did it just right. They were cute enough, while avoiding being too over-the-top or overtaking the whole show, and it wasn't hard to buy into them as authentic, true-to-life kids. No snappy comebacks, no smart-alecky wit, just real kids. Of course, this is the only series that could get away with having them make a quickie appearance, run upstairs, and staying away from the remainder of the episode while the adults had long, heated conversations that often led to screaming matches. How on Earth did those children manage to sleep through it when their parents were duking it out in episodes such as the Season 4 classic ""Bad Moon Rising?"" To those kinds of questions, we may never have an answer, but for the purpose that it served, it worked just fine, and it helped the intended plot move right along.

Through it all, though, was it that helped the magic survive for 9 consistent years? Sure, the writing was excellent and always generated well-deserved laughter from the audience, but in the end, without the acting, it couldn't have happened. Plain and simple, the formula just would not have worked if Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett, Monica Horan, Doris Roberts, and Peter Boyle did not lead the cast with remarkable precision and skill. They each had their own special little quality that they brought to the mix (e.g. Ray's endearingly nasal voice, Amy's million dollar facial expressions). By the time Amy McDougal's painfully straight-laced parents (so un-Barone) and kooky younger brother made it to the fold in Season 7, it was evident that the casting was nearly flawless. There is perhaps no other television family that worked together as well as these seasoned stars, and defying what is natural with most shows, they only seemed to get better with time. Simply stated, they all just seemed to understand exactly what the script required, and when they got in front of the camera, they executed with impressive ease. They knew what it was all about, and through the family that they created together, the show became entirely their own. Beyond just being a talented and experienced group of actors, they delivered as a convincing American family that got at each other's throats half the time, but still managed to be strong and close-knit in their own way. As perfectly spoken by beloved actor Peter Boyle, ""Every character got the ball, and everyone got to score"" when it came to the razor-sharp dialogue, and that's exactly how any piece of solid television should be.

With that being said, be sure to remember that this set is coming out on October 30, right in time for Halloween--and as long as we're talking about that holiday, don't forget to watch the hysterical ""Halloween Candy"" episode from Season 3 (whether you've seen it or not, it's some truly great stuff). If you've had a bad day at work, you're tired or just need a little break, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is perfect for the spirits and can always be counted on to lighten the mood. As for this great big, newly designed edition, the outer box is slated to look like Ray and Debra's house, with all the main characters peeking out of the windows, and all 9 seasons will be placed under one roof (in this case, literally). Special features haven't been announced yet, but I wouldn't expect anything that hasn't already been on the previous sets. I mean, I guess it's possible that they'll add a few new things here and there, but for the most part, the $200 list price on this item is for the cool new packaging, some cast photos from over the years, maybe a new episode guide......things along those lines. If you're a fan who hasn't started buying the DVD's yet, this is the perfect excuse to do so; with all the episodes arranged and sold together, it's basically a dream come true for the hard-core Barone junkies.

Maybe not everyone will agree with me when I say that it is one of the greatest shows ever made, but surely it's one of the best comedies out there, and in a society where complete series DVD's are becoming the norm, here's one of the ""best bets"" that will surely be watched and re-watched often enough to make the investment worth it!",1186531200,169,8874,4.808120497707924

2923990,5,B000UR9TKK,I love this show. I was so disappointed when Netflix removed it that I decided to buy the series on DVD. It's nice to have a show to watch that is funny and entertaining without all the sex and violence that most shows seem to be full of.

2924002,4,B000UR9TKK,"I was a little disappointed when my mother ( it was a gift to her) opened her gift because I expecting it to be the dvd set that you can display as a house. I looked through some of the reviews on here and some had the house display.
The picture is  just a little fuzzy, nothing to ruin the experience. Its something that can be fixed with adjustments to the tv settings. All seasons are there and it came with the script of the final finale. Seasons 1-3 do not come with the ""play all"" option, which means when one episode ends you would have to go back to the main menu to play the next one. However seasons 4-9 do have the ""play all"" option. If I knew anyone else who liked this series I would buy it again.  I'm giving this 4 stars because I'm just disappointed about the house display.",1514419200,,790,4.123376623376624

2924004,5,B000UR9TKK,"I mainly bought this as a gift for my wife, but it is a gift for myself as well. We both really liked this show when the episodes were new. Yes, they have reruns probably every night on select stations, but it isn't the same as owning the collection. With the collection you have a choice where to start, or just simply watch all the way through. This show ranks with the greats as a family to watch. I grew up with the Simpsons, Roseanne, Al Bundy, Home Improvement family, and of course the Cosby family. You really get to know these TV families. With this collection you can sit back and enjoy the Barone family all you want.",1513987200,,628,4.285714285714286

2924009,3,B000UR9TKK,"The package came nicely packaged and on time.  Once we started to watch it though, we realized some of the disc are scratched (Season 2, disc 5; Season 3, disc 4; Season 4, disc 2 & 5; Season 6, disc 5; Season 7, disc 4 & 5).  This is very inconvenient for there to be this many with scratches on a 'brand new' package.  I'm not even sure how to contact the seller (which is labeled 'Various') to remedy this problem.",1511568000,,417,4.1234567901234565

2924011,1,B000UR9TKK,"Love this series. Disks act like they were made in someone's mom's basement. Would have returned them but they sat on my shelf for months before I got around to watching them.

The box contains nine plastic DVD cases (one for each season), each holding 4 or 5 discs each.  About as compact as it gets and provides excellent storage and protection.  Great job, HBO!

She then pushes him into the bookcase so hard the top detaches from the bottom. Not funny. I stopped watching. If you are going to be comedy be funny not physically aggressive. The episode  should have been yanked. Too bad.  It was a decent series up till then.,1502496000,,400,4.391891891891892

First, I love the series, and when Netflix dropped this, it was the last straw for me and I dropped Netflix.  Second, the packaging on this couldn't be better, with a case for each season, with each disk snapped into it's own holder in the case.

2924140,1,B000UR9TKK,"I purchased this set as a Christmas gift for my Fiance several years ago (now wife) as she really loved the series. We thought we would both revisit the series at some point in time.

That point in time came yesterday and what we found out is that I paid $120 for a series we can't watch.  It also means I owe her one Christmas gift for that year.

It seems that many of the discs (so far I should say most of the discs) won't play but the first 1 - 3 episodes on each disc.  So I basically bought her 1/3 of a TV series in a souvenir house.  The house in itself had problems is some of the glued on windows fell off.

I don't know if the newer packaging is any better.  But I can't bring myself to repurchase something I originally paid over a $100 dollars for.  I've purchased several hundred TV series over the years, with the intention of enjoying them when I retired.  Now I can only hope none of these others has such a problem.  I learned a late lesson, probably too late.  Always check about ten or more of the discs if you don't intend to watch them right away.  And be wary of this one in particular because some of the reviews says there hasn't been much improvement.

Each DVD slips into its own sleeve/slot within the separate series season's holders. Plus, it comes with a signed (albeit copy printed) booklet with the finale script.

Second, the video quality is quite good for standard DVDs and the extras makes this a fun and entertaining look at life on Long Island. I think Everybody Loves Raymond is one the best sitcoms and will continue to relate for generations. I'm happy to have this nice set in my DVD collection.

FYI: I got the ""House"" set on ebay for $79..I still see it available for $89 ($10 less than Amazon).",1472256000,,700,4.5476190476190474

2924241,5,B000UR9TKK,"I don't know about the others, but I love this set inside and out. I read most, if not all, the reviews before my purchase and I'm glad I did because it really helped me make a decision. Though I wanted the ""house"" packaging, it just had too many negative reports about warped or scratched discs. I live in the Philippines and the return option that buyers in the US enjoy is just not reasonably available to me. So I settled with the simple box set and I am very happy with it. The dvds are all nicely tucked and protected inside. The cases are slim, so if you think that 9 seasons of a set might take up a whole shelf, hardly. It's just about half the size of a shoebox. I have watched seasons 1 through 3 and so far, no scratches nor jumps, and all the dvds work. I think if I come across any jump along the way, I'd be laughing too hard to notice anyway, so don't worry about it.

Now for the content and how the episodes are put together. There is no debate on the genius of this show so I won't go there. This is really for everybody who loves Raymond. And Robert. And Frank and Marie. And Debra. So if you're not one of us, just don't buy it. But if you are, I'd like to say a bit about the common complaint I've read here about the fact that the producers didn't put in a ""PLAY ALL"" feature. I thought that would be something annoying at first, but when I saw how they allowed the viewer to ""take a break"" and manually choose the next episode, I thought it was really a non-issue (with me at least). I like that I'm able to still laugh at the jokes and punch lines before I tune in to the next one, or make a quick trip to the snack pantry skippity hopping to the jazz piano tune that has now become like a siren that means ""IT'S LAUGH TIME!"" in my house. I also like that they present a simple synopsis of the episode before you choose it. I don't know, I just like reading titles because it helps me get ready. :)

But wait! I think the producers have been listening in to all the ""no play all"" complaints here because I just started on the 3rd season and... Viola! ... PLAY ALL. It turns out so far that only seasons 1 and 2 don't have the play all button. Not sure if the rest of the seasons are like this... we'll see. I guess it's a good feature to have if you want to watch it nonstop.

So there. I hope my review has helped you. And I hope you will enjoy every episode as much as my whole family does.",1442707200,81,2417,4.020790020790021

2924243,5,B000UR9TKK,"Everybody Loves Raymond....everybody. just everybody.

Robert Barone wishes and envies his brother, but knows when to be a brother, when Raymond has a problem when he is balancing checkbooks, he helps him out with money. Raymond tries to help him back in other regards, but always knowing the predicament that Robert faces when he's at home, living with Marie and Frank, the former loving to meddle into everyone's business like it's her own. And this leaves poor Debra to fend for herself 99.99% of the time, where she is always wrong and Marie is always right, with Raymond always buckling down, scared of his mom.

Watch the complete show to find out about their adventures.

2924251,5,B000UR9TKK,"I will join the masses in their love of the show and it's characters.  I always honor and respect the writers for their creativity and believe that they are the true stars of any successful program.  However, with ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", only the actors can make this show special.  They couldn't replace a single one of them, including the occasional actors, with out seriously diminishing the program.  That's why I glad that they decided to end the show before any actor had to leave. My slight favorite is Debra. She doesn't have the greatest body but she has a face I could stare into for the rest of my life.  Those eyes and expressions would blow me away every time.  Raymond was very lucky that she choose him because he could never win a girl like that on his own. Yeah, everybody loves Raymond.  Now Amy is the wonderful girl next door that most men would love to call a wife.  Robert made the right choice because that hot Italian girl would have him fighting off every hound dog and there is now way she could keep up that great sexy body over the decades.  Now to the DVD set.  Well, I watch the show on a standard television.  However, the DVD is played on my surround sound system.  And to my surprise, I get an added bonus of the great theme song at the end of the show coming through and it's truly wonderful.  I now play the theme song over and over.  Something you can't do with most syndicated broadcast.
Again, can anyone question why I gave this DVD five stars!!!",1434672000,4,1488,4.402930402930403

2924334,3,B000UR9TKK,"Never made a better purchase. Was a big fan of the show when it was on and love being able to see it now whenever I want. This is a very well thought-out and executed package from the actual packaging to the content. Love it.

UPDATE: While I still love the show and am happy (overall) with this purchase, LET ME WARN YOU. This collection contains 45 discs and it takes a while to view them all. Nonetheless, I advise you that when you receive your set, you immediately go through EVERY disc in the collection, EVERY episode and ALL the bonus material contained therein. I reviewed quite a few discs but became bored with it after awhile because all SEEMED well. I began viewing the discs in chronological order. It took some time to get to Season 9, the final set in the collection. THAT'S WHEN THE PROBLEMS BEGAN. There are 4 discs in the final season. Of the 4, only 2 function properly. Two of the discs will only show certain episodes and none of the bonus material, which is usually very enjoyable as well.

I WROTE AMAZON.COM AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I INQUIRED AS TO AN EXCHANGE OF THE SEASON 9 PACKAGE AS IT IS THE ONLY DEFECTIVE ONE. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY. BUYER BEWARE!!

SECOND UPDATE: I never received any reply from Amazon.com concerning my problem with the last set of discs (Season 9) in the Complete Series....I gave up. So, wanting a COMPLETE set, I ordered only Season 9 from an Amazon.com vendor and took the loss on the first set. This set of discs arrived in short order AND GUESS WHAT? You guessed it. It was defective as well. This time however, I checked the discs out (only 4 to view) early. I asked for and got and a refund....but, I had to package and send the defective discs back. So, I went to a local Hastings Book Store and inquired about Season 9. They had it in stock. The price was a little higher than Amazon.com but I paid it. The store manager told me, after hearing my story, that if this set was defective, they would continue to order me one until I was satisfied AT NO EXTRA CHARGE. I took the set home and voila, they all worked!",1417392000,9,2090,4.3538461538461535

2924344,5,B000UR9TKK,"I really love this series ""Everybody loves Raymond"".  Each character has a strong identity and is funny. Even the kids have funny one liners that make me laugh. I usually watch an episode before I go to bed, because at the end of the day, I need to laugh and remember that I am blessed that my family is not like theirs. The main theme is that everybody loves Raymond, and the older brother Robert notices that things just go well for Raymond. Even their mother loves Raymond more than him, she makes it very clear by her actions. Raymond tries hard not to let the bountiful amount of love and attention get in the way of his family life and work, but deep inside he loves it. If you want to laugh and enjoy something your whole family can view, buy this series.",1410912000,6,762,4.291666666666667

2924374,5,B000UR9TKK,"Its a simple premise (family lives across the street from the husbands parents) but after nine years and a couple hundred episodes its still funny to the end.  Its quite an accomplishment that there is not a single bad episode in the entire series.  Its a testament to the great writing and the even better performances.  Its character driven comedy and Everybody Loves Raymond has some of the best regular characters around.  Even the ""guest"" characters are memorable (the ""cookie mom"", Deborah's Parents, Amy's family, etc.).  Another example of a show that took itself off the air before it stopped being fun.",1400112000,,612,4.96078431372549

2924394,4,B000UR9TKK,"I don't usually rate DVD's because we buy what we've seen already and what people that we personally know recommend.  That being said, there is one thing in particular that I really like about this DVD set.  There are very few chapter advances which means I only have to click the skip button 4 times to get to the next episode if I so choose to do it that way.  There is a chapter mark after the opening credits, one about half way through each episode and then one that takes you to the ending credits.  It's a small touch but one that has made this DVD set stand out.  I am thoroughly happy with this purchase.  I waited for it to go on sale and got it for under $90 in October of 2013.

Update:  After watching the whole series, there are a few faulty video segments (2 or 3) on a couple of the DVD's.  Each bad section only lasts for 1 to 2 seconds so it's not enough of a problem to send them back.",1388620800,4,904,4.033707865168539

Whoever designed the menu system on the dvd's needs to be shot. No 'Play All' option on the discs and you had to select 'Play' twice to play an episode.,1387152000,2,418,3.872093023255814

This is a series that is worth every penny and developed back when comedy was about clean humor and not sex.  The language in today's comedies is simply not appropriate, and I feel today's producers use sex and language out of desperation to draw an audience.  I prefer good writing and healthy subject matter.  That's exactly what this series offers.",1386892800,,508,4.5777777777777775

The bottom piece of packing tape had totally opened, and if I hadn't lifted from the bottom, this item and the other in the box would have fallen out.

The drawback for me lies in seasons 1 and 2 as they do not include the 'play all' option. Also, and this is throughout entire series' disks: when chosing an individual episode to watch, there's an extra 'step' after selecting an episode. After selecting an episode, the next screen is the episode description which also includes various 'play' options. Miniscule glitches and nothing to keep me from being so very glad to have the series in my collection of beloved series. Watching commercial free and on my schedule is SUCH a blessing.

The problem is that they come shipped in these cardboard painted DVD sleeves that are color coded for each season.  The nasty thing is that the paint from the cardboard sleeves sticks like a residue to the disc, rendering them unplayable.

I used rubbing alcohol to clean the miniscule paint flecks and stains off the disc (because water just wouldn't do the trick).  Unfortunately, they fixed some parts but not others, and all the discs have huge sections that freeze or don't play, rendering many episodes unwatchable.

Amazon rocks - they did refund my purchase after I described these - but I have unwatchable DVDs.  This manufacturer sucks.  They should skip the packaging and just sell the DVDs in good old soft sleeves for less money.  Then  you'd actually get to watch ""Everybody Loves Raymond.",1334361600,4,989,4.6
2924478,1,B000UR9TKK,"The series is great, but...
Here is a thought for the companies who put out the DVD sets... instead of wasting money on unique design, spend the packaging budget on ""disc friendly"" boxing.
This ""house"" setup is built like a precision puzzle, with very tight cardboard sleeves for the DVD's.
Even though I bought a DVD binder to put the series in, I am finding that some of the discs are damaged and will not play properly due to paint transfer and scratches.
On a couple of the discs you can even see the crescent shaped shadow of the pocket embedded into the disc surface.
Hint to the production staff: rough, tight, color shedding cardboard pockets are NOT adequate shipping or storage boxes for DVD's!
Naturally since I bought the set over a year ago, no longer have the invoice, and had not watched the series until now to discover the product flaws - I am stuck with a damaged purchase.",1332028800,11,891,4.540372670807454
2924479,3,B000UR9TKK,"Content:  This series is brilliant in its writing and articulation.  There is hardly an episode where there are not laugh out loud moments.  It's easy to understand why the series had such staying power and stacks of awards.  The extras are both interesting and enlightening, as to casting, producing and writing, plus many hilarious out-takes.
Product:  Frustrating packaging with discs jammed in, hard to extract. Technically, although not Blue Ray, the product should play on a Blue Ray player.  This was not the case, as the discs continually froze and pixilated.  Having a regular player saved the day, or so I thought, as half way through the first season, freezing and pixilating set in again.  Fortunately, with a gentle soap and warm water wash, I was able to solve the problem. As I have not finished viewing all seasons, I fully expect the freezing problem to rear it's ugly little head again.

2924496,5,B000UR9TKK,"By my review title, you can derive several intended meanings.  Kind of like the literary series ""The Comedy of Interaction In Human Relationships"" by Chester Isaiah Muncie.  I could be saying that you might decide to purchase this, or you might not.  I could be saying (since this review surfaces between Thanksgiving and Christmas) that this might be under the Christmas tree or it might not.  I could be saying you may understand the serious side, the comedy side, and/or the psychology of human behavioral sciences; or you might not.  I could be referring to the marketing concept of packaging the complete series in a box that resembles the house frequently shown in the TV series.  I could be saying that instead of buying this one season at a time, you're the kind of person/fan who knows what they want and choose to dig for a bargain way to save money at the same time of getting what you want out of life.  Or I could be referring to parasitical viruses borne by pathogenic means that result in shivering, runny nose, and severe fatigue.  ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" requires being given a chance to grow on you, and a little history on each character actor / character actress (Peter Boyle was the monster on Mel Brook's film, ""Young Frankenstein"").  Buying the complete series requires having the resources or finding it used, or on sale.  Either you get it or you don't.",1323043200,,1380,4.7125

In my opinion the show gets even better after the first season and is good all the way to season 9.  i guess i don't want to write a lot of stuff most of the other reviewers wrote about the show itself.  but just want to point out to anyone shopping for the whole series, thats its way cheaper to buy the seasons individually.  it comes to about $90.  if you buy all the seasons together in these box sets, its almost double.  On top of that the cases that the discs are in in this box set look to be paper sleaves. the individual seasons are packaged in hardened cases where the discs snap in place and are better protected.  they also fit in a dvd shelf better than these fake house shaped boxes.  even if price was the same i'd buy the seasons individually.",1314316800,6,822,4.158227848101266

That said, why does HBO have such shoddy packaging???  I received my set and the individual season sleeves were so tightly bound by the outter sleeve that I thought I would have to tear the packaging in order to access the dvds.  I was able to pull out a dialogue ""script"" of the last show (huh???) that was included and that loosened up things a bit.  Then I opened Season 1, disc 1.  The discs are jammed into the CARDBOARD pockets pretty well, which might explain why almost ALL of my dvds-from EVERY season-have a thin line of color that seem to be match the cardboard pockets. Hmm.....also, a couple of the discs have small gashes (like the had been dropped), and a plastic substance peeling from the edge and sides.  I've tried to see if gently rubbing with a lens cloth would remove it, but no such luck.  I'm going to have to check EVERY disc to see if it affects playing, but who's knows what will happen a week/month/year down the road?  Return it, you say?  Looks like I will.  Amazon does have the option to exchange, but I have a feeling it would be more of the same.

I have no use for reviews relating to the artistic content of the series. I need reviews that state how well the product is produced and packaged.

Is it worth $40 extra for the set that comes in a house? Does the less expensive set have a higher percentage of defective discs?

Personally, listening to the Raymond character whine grates on my nerves, but my wife loves the show and wants the complete set. She has the first season which lacks the ""play all"" capability. Are all the discs like that or does the complete series provide the ""play all"" feature for every season?

The 4th episode of the first disk of season 1 would not play at all (odd that it was the same with both sets) and both sets had paint on the ""play"" sides due to the paint from the cardboard sleeves.  The first season came in a red sleeve, so all the disks from that season had red paint on them and caused some of them to not play correctly.  The second season came in a green sleeve and had green paint on the disks and the 3rd season came in a blue sleeve and had blue paint on them, etc...I could scratch most of it off with my fingernail, but some of them skipped in the areas where the paint was.  Also, the first set had glue on 2 of the DVD's which caused them to skip or not play at all in those areas.  I couldn't remove all of the glue and actually scratched one of the DVD's trying to do so.

Unfortunately, probably 75% of the discs that came in this package had residue of colored film from the edges of the packaging it came in.

2924520,5,B000UR9TKK,"Fell in love with the series AFTER it went into syndication; maybe because I did not have the time to catch it while in prime time TV. However, the characters and plots were great.  Many times Raymond seems self affecting and elitist; but I guess he was the star of the show and everyone else had to look up to him.  Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts were the consummate character actors; in fact my late stepfather looked and acted just like him, and Brad Garrett was the ultimate second banana on the show. Sometimes Patricia Heaton could grate on you, but she held her lines well.  Overall, a great series to own and watch at your leisure; not as trendsetting as All In the Family, but dysfunctional nonetheless.",1290556800,,711,4.5390625

""Everybody Loves Raymond"" delivers perfect comical timing every single episode without ever trying too hard! It's not dipped in sexual innuendo's or trying to make a larger-than-life impression of the cast members...it only teaches us all a lesson as to how the most drab and hapless situations in life which we inevitably allow to set us apart in our family lives can be treated in a comical way!

The big BUT thou is the packaging. It came abit damaged, and therefore had to send it back for another. Funny thing (as has happened in the past) the 2nd set came better packaged. Why cant Amazon pack properly the first time round? Rather then sets in boxes with a couple of air balloons. Would certainly save the hassle of sending things back !!

Seriously, it provides endless entertainment for her and that gives me time for myself. And who couldn't use a bit more personal time.  Glad it was on sale.

As for the show, I must give it credit as it is quite entertaining.  To live across the street from your parents and brother is just too much.  Especially if they are the Barones.

2924535,5,B000UR9TKK,"Anybody who is married and aware of the complex mesh of relationships involving your spouse, children, parents, siblings, in-laws, relatives, neighbors, and co-workers, should be able to appreciate the trials of Raymond, Debra, and company.  I alternate between being horrified to the point of being unable to watch, to pleasantly amused.  My parents are of the same ""World War Two Generation"" as Frank and Marie--and I can see many of these same behaviors played out in our own life (although to a less extreme degree).

This show has a really talented cast!  That said, I would like to say that I particularly like Patricia Heaton's portrayal of Debra.  In many ways, she is the prism through which we see the Barone family, and to watch the development of her character over the course of the series is fascinating.  Although her character begins the series as relatively sedate and low key, by the end of the series she is almost as paranoid, scheming, and manipulative as her nemesis and mother-in-law Marie.

My private wish is for Patricia Heaton to play Hillary Clinton.  Both are from affluent midwestern suburbs, as is reflected in their accent and intonation.  Both have the ability to convey a particular type of authority.  With all of Ray's petty lies and convoluted plots to deceive Debra (often to step out with his ""mistress golf""), I could see the two of them doing a comic bit as Bill and Hillary.  But seriously now, Ray should not seek out the role of Bill Clinton.  Patricia Heaton, however, really should play Hillary Clinton completely straight.",1278288000,,1569,4.901515151515151

Part of the roof was pushed in as well.  I returned this to Amazon and they sent out another set.  Same problem again.  There are huge scratches all over the bottom of the DVD case.  The roof is deformed in some places.  I have a hard time believing this type of damage is due entirely to shipping.

After reading some other reviews on the same item from different sellers, I was concerned about this being shipped to Australia.

Second concern was whether it would play on my DVD player. I am a region 4 zone, these DVD's are region 1. Some region free DVD players still do not play certain dvd's regardless -- These played perfectly and are just wonderful.

2924576,5,B000UR9TKK,"This comedy is hilarious. I enjoy watching this typical Long Island family oriented show. The full collection allows you to view in chronological order the saga of the Baron's and to easy choose the parts you like most. The DVD set came in its original package, collection style, and it is of an excellent video and audio quality, better than some episodes I saw on TV.",1237680000,2,369,4.606060606060606

2924578,5,B000UR9TKK,I love this series. I only had a chance to watch couple episodes on the TV and when i saw the complete set available on amazon i could not stop myself from buying it. Its a true work of art - comedy with some great script writing and very fine acting. All characters are memorable and they do a splendid job. Very happy with my purchase and i wish there were some more episodes in the series.,1236297600,2,392,4.103896103896104
2924579,5,B000UR9TKK,"First off, I have to admit that I got this set on a Gold Box special for about $64.00, which is well below what the price is now, so that was over a $100.00 savings.

What really made this a great deal is that the packaging of the discs made playing of the discs trouble free. I ordered the complete set of MASH last year, and because of its hard cardboard packaging, over a third of those discs were damaged just from being inserted into their cardboard sleeves, and trying to get them out to play them just damaged them more.

Our family is now into season three of this set with no skips, stops, etc, because the discs can be removed and re-inserted into their holders with no damage. And, the show just gets better and better in the later seasons.",1236124800,2,751,4.28169014084507

2924581,5,B000UR9TKK,This little package is everything you could want and more.  I purchased this as a surprise gift for my lovely challenged daughter.  She was so thrilled and has spent so many hours enjoying each and every episode.  I have never had so many hugs over a gift.  Raymond is so full of laughs to be enjoyed over and over for years to come.  Thank you Amazon for a great price and quick service.,1235174400,3,388,4.260273972602739
2924582,5,B000UR9TKK,"actually I'm writing this review after just receiving the long waited set, and from my first impression it's nothing less than AMAZING!
it comes in a relatively small package, shaped like raymond's house.
after you open the roof you can find the complete series. each season is packed seperately in somekind of a ""mini-book"", all made out of carton.
the seasons are at diffrent heights, so it's easy to pick the season you want, and start watching.
each season case contains a printed table of contents with the name and location of every episode.
beside all the episodes and many extra features, there's also a small printed book, that contains the script of the series finale, with the autographs of the entire writing staff (including Ray Romano).

from a couple of randomly picked episodes that I've watched, the quality of them is very good, and they contain English subtitles which is very important to many people.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
if you like the series of Everybody Loves Raymond, you should order it RIGHT NOW! it's an amazing and beautiful set, that contains one of the best sitcoms ever made. it's a must-to-have set for every fan, and for every DVD collector out there.",1235001600,27,1183,4.822660098522167

Unfortunately, the packaging for the DVD set is so flimsy that by the time we recieved it the ""house"" style boxing that the DVD set comes in was falling completely apart. I was quite disappointed.",1234828800,,393,4.614285714285714

It also includes bonus features - interviews with Ray and the creator of the show (I can't remember his name), how the show was created, how the actors were selected, etc... and some early standup routines of Ray's. It was interesting to find out that many episodes are based on actual events like the fruit of the month episode!  You'll love it!",1234742400,,415,4.816901408450704

2924596,4,B000UR9TKK,"This DVD set is pretty much all the different seasons season sets put into one box. The only extra that is added is a reproduction of the script for the final episode, which is a cute addition but nothing special or worth making you upgrade to this set in case you own the whole series in individual season sets.
The packaging is nice and simple but it includes episode names but no episode description or special booklets like in the Friends and Seinfeld sets.
I picked this up for 60$ on Goldbox and im glad i didn't pay the usual  120$ for this as I would have been disappointed, if you don't own any season (Like me) pick this up as it adds a nice touch to your collection, but if you already own a few seasons, just continue buying them separatley as this set doesnt add anything extra.

The top of the box itself (a little cardboard house) literally fell apart as I took it off.  Rather than go through the hassle of returning this to get a replacement, I'm just going to tape it up.  However, I hope this isn't indicative of what's to come once I pop the DVDs into the player.

I've only seen a few episodes of this show and really enjoyed it.  I just hope that the quality of manufacturing doesn't affect how much I end up enjoying the show!",1233100800,6,609,4.162393162393163
2924599,2,B000UR9TKK,"We got this DVD set with so much of expectations. Both audio and video quality is not on par with regular DVDs. You will notice the difference very well, if you watch it on anything above 32"" TV.

The show is good, and we wanted to watch it without commercial breaks, but as soon we played our first episode, we were disappointed with the quality. The broadcast from the local channels are much better than this DVD. We will give it a try once it is on high definition.",1233100800,8,469,4.269662921348314

2924602,5,B000UR9TKK,"I had watched a few episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond as Reruns(never actually watched it when it was on the air) and LOVED IT! A Hilarious Comedy about real people dealing with real situations! A rare show today that doesnt use Gutter humor or Sexual jokes to get a laugh. Doris Roberts is AMAZING as Raymonds Mother and is one of the most Underrated Actress's of her era(this woman should be a SUPERSTAR)!  I had always wanted to start buying the dvd sets but just never got around to it. Well, Amazon solved that problem when they were basically giving the set away for $64.99 during their deal of the day ! I snapped that deal up FAST!

This in an INCREDIBLE price for all of the seasons. I have found it very relaxing to pull these out and watch a few episodes from time to time. The quality of the DVDs are great! I would recommend this set to anyone who appreciates quality television shows.

If you have a second, look at the 1-star review by John entitled ""Hateful & Pointless"" I found it quite humorous how he says that he hated the series but that he ""averaged maybe one good chuckle per episode.""  You know what is so great about this show? Anyone can easily get hooked on it! Including our ignorant friend John.

2924613,5,B000UR9TKK,"This is my first purchase of a complete series. I'm not a big fan of TV comedies.  Most of them seem crude, predictable and immature. However, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" presents a refreshing, real world comedy with warmth and intelligence. There are many poignant moments as Ray tries to define himself as a husband and father and get out from under his mother's thumb.  His brother Robert gradually evolves to get his own life even as he tries to disentangle himself from Marie's apron strings and an ongoing sibling rivalry.  Aside from being entertaining,  there are lessons to be learned about forgiveness, communication, sharing and enjoying the moment. The episodes are fresh and interesting and usually contain sensitive human insights.

The set arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  I have played the first 10 episodes so far. Except for a rare flicker in the picture on one DVD (which might have been caused by my DVD player) I am pleased with the quality.  I love the storage box - a house with faces of all the family looking at you through the windows - it makes a nice display.  The individual cases have sturdy cardboard sleeves with an additional paper liner to protect the playing surface of each disc.  It is great fun watching the series from the beginning. Each episode shows a picture and a brief synopsis of the plot which helps when you are trying to find your favorites among 210 episodes.  I have been watching 1 episode per night.  It provides my daily dose of laughter (which the Bible says is ""good medicine"") and the opportunity to unwind after a busy and/or stressful day.

The purchase price of $199.00 seems reasonable for what was included.",1225152000,6,1685,4.772413793103448
2924614,5,B000UR9TKK,This is a great series.  I would rank this comedy up there with Seinfeld and King of Queens.  The box art is also impressive for displaying purposes.,1219190400,2,149,4.481481481481482

They are brand new; priced lower than the stores and + it saves me GAS.

2924641,5,B000UR9TKK,"I got this set for my Mom for Christmas. She loves Everybody Loves Raymond. The packaging for this product is just great and it's alot nicer to have all your dvd's in one box. Mom has not watched any of them yet since I just gave them to her on Christmas Eve, but she was so excited to receive all nine seasons. She watches reruns everynight.
If your a big fan or know of anybody that is, I highly recommed this.",1198540800,3,412,4.098765432098766

2924643,5,B000UR9TKK,"I paid less than 150 for this. Am based in Dubai, UAE and here it is atleast 4 times more expensive-and you do not get all the seasons together. You have to buy each season separately. If you are fan of ELR (and you would be if you are visiting this page), then this is a must have.",1198281600,2,282,3.8793103448275863

I get it, the series is nearly 20 years old and I'm not expecting anything close to HD - but the picture and sound are unwatchable! Save your $100 and hopefully it will show back up on Netflix..",1526860800,,281,4.222222222222222
