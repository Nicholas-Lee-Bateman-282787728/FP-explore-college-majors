7035400,5,B00UB76R9U,"June Fraser (Brooke D'Orsay) has had her heart set on being married outdoors on a warm June day. She has shared this dream with her mother for years before her mother's passing. Now almost alone with her dream, will she find that a wedding is more about the marriage ceremony or about their two lives together? June is a hardworking nurse which made her all the more interesting to me as I worked in the nursing field in my day too. I am also very drawn to a wedding themed storyline and though this Hallmark film may be a bit  predictable, I was glad it was. I happen to enjoy films that don't complicate stories with too much confusion and keep it light fare for the viewing. Call Hallmark movies my guilty pleasure that I view while I am alone and you would be correct ...

June's intended husband is Alex Blackwell (Wes Brown) who comes from a well to do family and makes a great living as a lawyer himself. He proposed to June on New Year's Eve so the wedding day should go off without a hitch and is set to be in June, but there is trouble brewing. This trouble would be in a few different forms. One in the location as Alex has been asked to start working at a prominent law firm and then also with Alex's conniving mother, Diana Blackwell (Marilu Henner) who operates with little affection for June, is relentlessly domineering and takes over the planning from her. With the intended move to Cleveland for a new position for Alex, June has no time to plan this wedding and especially as she is expected to have it ready to go in January. Can June keep all of this together or does she choose to listen to some 'advice' that provokes a decision-making process. Through it all, she speaks her piece.

Then there is another problem in the person who has feelings for Alex that Diana has no problems with at all. It is her secretary who also has her eyes on Alex. Diana is an ice queen at this point, can be brutal and does steal the show at times. Will she ever accept June or will she continue scheming her way into the place of most importance along with that secretary of hers? Or possibly all is fair in love and marriage and June or January weddings. A wedding story that I enjoyed the easy styling of.",1427673600,19,2212,4.325301204819277
7035401,5,B00UB76R9U,"June in January is about  young woman named June Fraser (Brooke D'Orsay) who has been dreaming of her wedding day since she was a little girl with her mother.  June has always wanted to be June bride like her mother. June's mother died a few years ago.  When June's boyfriend, Alex (Wes Brown)  pops the question to June  she can't wait to start planning her June wedding. When Alex announces to June what he got a job in Cleveland and they need to get married in January.  June feels like her dream was crushed.  June does not feel like her future mother-law Diana (Marilu Henner)  likes her at all. June has to pull a wedding off in three weeks. Watch this movie to see if June and Alex gets married or not.

7035463,4,B00UB76R9U,"This was a cute, clean movie, and my teenaged daughter and I enjoyed watching it together.  The message that ""it's not supposed to just be about the wedding, it's about the relationships"" was a good one, especially in today's over-commercialized world of ""plan-the-wedding-all-you-life-insert-groom-when-found"" world.  I, for one, was thrilled to see that was the message.  Marilu Henner's character was a nice touch, she wasn't really an ""evil MIL"", just one who felt shunted to the side and replaced and The End.  As a MIL, I can relate to that feeling and it hurts.

Only one complaint:  NO SUBTITLES and the Closed Captioning did not work on our new TV  : (  I'm hearing impaired and subtitles and closed captioning make the difference in a truly enjoyable movie and one where I have to turn the volume up so LOUD to hear the dialogue over the background music that it's annoying.  This is an ongoing issue with Hallmark movies and some other made-for-TV then released on DVD movies, unfortunately.",1441929600,2,1002,4.916666666666667

7035516,2,B00UB76R9U,"Disappointing at best. I love Marilu Henner and Brooke D'Orsay but this movie crawled along on and I kept watching the clock to see how much longer I had to endure to get to the good parts. I finally skipped through to the last 15 minutes just in time to catch Marilu (mother of the groom)  teetering down the aisle in a ridiculously short dress for a woman her age. At last I though, we're getting somewhere with this film!
Wait, no. ..we're not.
Sadly this film really was completely predictable (which would have been fine) except it was also oddly dull.
The highlight? Pondering how Marilu looked so fab in that completely non-age-appropriate dress.",1430784000,2,653,4.678260869565217
7035517,5,B00UB76R9U,"I LOVED this movie. With Hallmark movies it is hit or miss with how they decide to release them. It has made me beyond crazy!!! BUT this movie was a gem for anyone who wants a sweet, clean, lovely story.",1429056000,,203,4.1
7035518,5,B00UB76R9U,"I have watched June in January ALOT and this is by far my best movie.  I am trying to follow Wes Browns career , and his acting simply amazes me.  Brooke has simply won me over on how she can  be a perfect match for Wes.  Brooke's career is going to take her far.  Wes and Brooke has good chemistry together.  Wes was pretty  aloof at times but when it comes to Romance and drama he has definitely got it.  I sure HOPE these two make some more movies together.  So go see this movie and Cheer these two on, I know I will.  Since I wrote this review last, it has remained MY FAVORITE MOVIE>  I play this movie at least 3 times a week.  It sounds funny huh?  But this movie has a lot of  meaning to me.  June wants to hang on to her  Mothers memory and she is afraid of letting her dream wedding  go, then her Moms  dreams for her will go also.  I think having a tight bond between mother and daughter is so special.  Alex and June  make such a beautiful couple and their chemistry is totally unbelievable.  I would like to see how far this couple will go?  So please give them a chance.  So in the end this is still a tale of Love Conquers all.  So please support this movie and BUY it.",1428883200,8,1185,3.982832618025751
