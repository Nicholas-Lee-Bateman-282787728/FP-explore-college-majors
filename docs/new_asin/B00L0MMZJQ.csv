8662961,5,B00L0MMZJQ,"the above review is obviously a marxist who never watched the film, probably just read a bunch of dumb liberal talking points from brain dead leftists who watched the film.

This film, did not tell me anything I didn't already know, but it reaffirmed my suspicions.  Just look at what is going on today, and the left's abysmal and despicable behavior.  Violent and childish college campuses, to whack-job politicians trying to shove socialism down our throats, to the uninformed half of the country that are blinded by leftist ideology and the Democratic corruption machine.",1532044800,,574,5.085106382978723

But now we can understand, and dismantle, the very mechanism.",1482537600,,125,5.0
8662963,1,B00L0MMZJQ,"This DVD is mostly paleoconservative propaganda - from putting scary voice overs on the Cultural Theorists described as ""Cultural Marxists"" to the many fake quotes (Zombie Gramsci is once again depicted as uttering Rudi Dutschke's ""long march"" quote) -  this 'documentary' is full of falsehoods, aggrandizements and a general sense of paranoia about what might happen if we analyze America's Cultural History.

It ultimately concludes by advising viewers to 1) Disconnect from the ""Cultural Marxist"" media 2) Divest from federal banks and 3) Learn about the constitution - particularly the importance of a well regulated militia. In doing so it's forced to also accept that freedom of speech is allocated to people of ALL political strokes. But the fact that it spends the previous 2 hours vilifying and demonizing relatively bland and outdated Cultural Theorists just seems really pointless and overbearing. Still what else can be expected from someone like James Jaeger whose other documentaries are about Chem trails and the banking system, and who rants on his own official website about how Jewish controlled Hollywood are out to stop his documentaries reaching the mainstream (because it's the Cultural Marxists keeping him down).

It would be nice if the documentary actually looked at Culture as something made by all of us - rather than claiming it's a product of a shadowy Marxist elite. It's all rather silly if you ask me.",1449532800,3,1434,5.199134199134199
8662964,5,B00L0MMZJQ,"Nails American History on the Head!

What more can I say? This video has put everything together very well and is pretty darn hard to dispute, though may seem confusing to those caught up in the revolutionary fervor of the times, or born after the 90's.

I can endorse this movie enough to all critical thinkers, church goers, and black sheep youth!",1421193600,6,349,4.612903225806452
