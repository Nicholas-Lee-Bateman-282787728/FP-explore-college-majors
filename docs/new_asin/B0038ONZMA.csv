8391601,2,B0038ONZMA,"the movies are ok and looks good but one thing the price of $150 for 5 movies. that would be $30 dollars each. Wall-e on amazon is $18. I would buy each movie it self than this collection. I don't see why i should play $10 more for each one. I would think about this collection only if  it is below $100. I understand you get blue-ray, DVD and digital but blue-ray is good enough. Then the extra, how many times will you watch that. I care more for the movies.",1439251200,3,460,4.054945054945055
8391602,5,B0038ONZMA,"My daughter loves anything Disney & has been collecting movies for several years, and has now included this awesome collection. The price is very reasonable for this super-cool collection of favorite characters, and fun-filled stories that entertain for hours of enjoyment. She loves Disney Pixar movies as much as she enjoys playing Pixar games on her X-box. I searched a few stores for a collection like this, but had no luck and she continues to add to her Disney collection, so we were happy to find it on Amazon. Highly entertaining & highly recommended!",1421280000,2,559,4.957446808510638
8391603,4,B0038ONZMA,Would have been 5 stars but a corner of the box was  crinkled other than that it was perfect,1417132800,,92,3.8421052631578947
8391604,5,B0038ONZMA,"This is an awesome package and has great movies in it. Each DVD has the standard, blu ray and digital copy!",1390003200,,107,4.142857142857143
8391605,4,B0038ONZMA,We wanted to start collecting the Pixar movies for our son and this was a good start. Many of them came with a digital copy as well so we could put them on my laptop. The packaging was a little inconsistent but all the movies work so that's what matters.,1364947200,,254,4.1
8391606,5,B0038ONZMA,This collection is our family favorite. Purchased as a gift for my kids and we watch the movies at least once a week.,1361059200,,117,4.130434782608695
8391607,5,B0038ONZMA,"I learned the hard way, when I missed Wal-E in it's original theatrical run, that you cannot sleep on ANY Pixar film.  The stories are always good and the artwork/technology are always showing you something a little new.  Now with Blu-ray you can see Pixar movies in High-Definition and experience them on a new level.  Pause nearly any scene and just explore the frame examining the details- it's incredible.

I was able to get this set through the Disney Movie Club and it was worth every penny.  You're paying about $31 per Movie in the set (which include the DVD and Digital copies, bonus discs for each) and the box itself is actually very cool (much better than photoshoppy product picture shown here).

Easy 5-stars.",1284595200,14,723,4.744
8391608,5,B0038ONZMA,"If your ready to start your Pixar collection on Blu ray, this is the box set to get. CARS, BUGS LIFE,MONSTERS INC,WALL E,RATATOUILLE and PIXAR SHORTS VOL 1 all wrapped in a nice blu ray collectors box. Each movie is packaged extactly like if you were to buy them seperately. Monsters inc for example has 4 discs in its case. I bought mine when it was $119.00 and feel I got a great deal. I looked all over the place to price check this set and no 1 seemed to carry it.",1270944000,27,468,4.0978260869565215
