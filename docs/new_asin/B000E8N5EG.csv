He finds the root of the problem, or more often, problems, and makes it right. And usually makes it much better than when he started.",1240012800,,310,5.098039215686274
2509908,5,B000E8N5EG,"Mike Holmes is Canada's premiere fix it guy. When previously a contractor has done shoddy work, and the homeowner is at wits end Mike and his crew step up to the plate and ""make it right"". If you live in the U S it may take you a few episodes to figure out that ""eves troughs"" are rain gutters LOL! but, Mike always goes above ""minimum code"" and I enjoy watching how he takes a botched repair and redesigns and reworks it so every thing is perfect. I have episodes 1 through 5 and I can't wait for 6 & 7 to be released. You can learn from these DVD's as well as be entertained by Mikes wit and the interactions of the crew members",1228521600,2,630,4.048
