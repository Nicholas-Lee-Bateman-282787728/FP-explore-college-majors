2455499,5,B000CC2GW6,"**This Review Is For The Whole Series In General**
I was surprised to see this on amazon, it was previously available only at his website which is where I bought it. This is the TOUGHEST yoga I had ever done and I have a big collection of yoga videos from Bryan Kest to Shiva Rea to Baron Baptiste and more. Each one of the dvd's has more than 90 minutes yoga practice which is thorough and tough , it's starts with about 60 minute of intense standing poses with vinyasas in between and some arm balances thrown in and then a 30 minutes of seated potures and some ab work ,inversions, headstand and savasana. Each DVD is similar in structure but each one offers some different poses from the other to prevent boredom in the practice as they suggest in the advertisement , so this series does not offer different level practices that progresses gradually although you may find one easier than the other .They suggest it's for all people and all levels (probably to increase sales) but I think it will be too much for beginners and people who are not in good shape and even for intermediates because this is a real hardcore practice , the pace in most of the workouts is pretty moderate except some push ups & jump bursts that creates heat and strength in the upper body ,but some of the poses are held long, like the half moon series, which really makes your leg and rear muscles scream. Each dvd also has a 30 minute instructional segment in which he gives some pointers and modifications for some of the poses (this segment is identical in all of the dvds).The set is simple and even a little cheap looking (not very important) ,there's a few studetns of all genders and ages including Mark's mom and a kid and from time to time he'll be checking they're doing the poses correctly ,most of the time he'll be doing the practice with them, also ther'es no music in the background. So if you want a long and challenging yoga practices you'll probbably like this series.",1136678400,12,1967,4.481894150417827

2455501,1,B000CC2GW6,"This a terribly produced dvd.  It has 4 sections:  the workout, the vinyasa practice, advanced poses (for viewing only) and instructional. I did the workout and it is mostly standing poses that are super hard and not a lot of variation, in my opinion.  There are no backbends and very few seated poses.  After this section, I hit the menu to view the vinyasa section which is with his wife only, with Mark giving instructions.  9 minutes into this, it (the section)just stops abruptly and returns to the main menu.  Before this section began, Mark said that this was a practice section that just needs a savasana at the end.  9 minutes?  What happened to the rest of it?  I pressed the next button and got another woman (not his wife)  doing back bends.  huh?  Where did this come from?  Also whenever I tried to fast forward, the dvd would freeze.  Normally if I like a dvd, I will excuse the technical problems.  But with this one, I felt that whoever produced this dvd was just lazy and since Mark Blanchard is in LA, which has countless video production people, there is no excuse for producing such crap.

As for the setting, it is on a sound stage with white drapes and everyone is wearing white. I have nothing against yogis in white, but the setting looked very cheap and 1980ish.  Also Mark does not cue very well.  Several times I had to look up to see what was going on to find that he and the class had moved on.

Don't waste your money on this one.  A much better power yoga dvd is by Sadie Nardini, a very well produced dvd.  She gives you enough material for several dvds on one dvd.  Not a half-baked yoga class in volumes, this being volume 1.  I sent this one right back for a refund.  I learned my lesson and I will never buy another Mark Blanchard dvd.",1245542400,7,1772,4.348623853211009

2455503,5,B000CC2GW6,"I purchased these DVD's around three years ago, and I can say that I recycle through them just as much as I do Bryan Kest series.  I have not found another yoga DVD that I like as much as these, except Bryan Kest, He by far can't be beat yet.
  I like these DVD's because I can interchange them and they still give me a good stretch and tonation.  They are all the same level of difficulty, they show demonstrators who are beginners to advanced to help any level.  I still feel like I have to push myself through these DVD's, which is a really good thing.  I never get bored of them if I am pushing myself.
  each DVD is about 120 minutes, give or take a few.  I only have time to do 45-60 minutes, so I have not really made it to the end. But I still feel like I get warmed up and get a great stretch and awesome muscle strengthening.  I am a very fit, healthy person; I exercise every day and I have been doing ballet for 25+ years and yoga for about 7 years- and almost everytime I finish one of these DVD's, I have a few sore muscles the next day- I love that!
  I also like these DVD's because the flow of the movements change, which help me stay focused, and I get my heartrate up a bit and I can feel my muscles working.  They are great DVD's if you like a challange.  I think any level of difficulty can perform them- they have different levels on the DVD to help guide you.  You won't regret buying them if you like a little challange.  Give 'em a try!",1215561600,2,1461,4.020833333333333
2455504,4,B000CC2GW6,"This is a good, powerful, athletic flow class.  I used this flow when I taught today.  The only irritating thing about Mark Blanchard is that he uses the phrase, ""easy goes"" over and over and over.",1203552000,,197,4.444444444444445
2455505,2,B000CC2GW6,"Vol 1
Workout - 93 min
Set in an inside stage w/flowing white drapes & colored lights. Mark & 4 women & 2 men in a V behind him all dressed in white. He speaks while he does the poses & then also just assists the students. There is no music. It is an honest, intermediate/advanced class. There are towels for people to wipe the sweat off & some falter on harder poses & have to take rests in child's pose which is refreshing to see imperfection & true human struggle.
Many poses including the advanced ones are held for a long time such as 3 legged dowward dog with leg pulled to the side towards teh hand, there are many warrior 3 & half mood, several hand stands, shoulder stands, crow, etc. He says to them struggling, ""Don't be afraid to try, you'll land on your feet. Unless you land on your head, then you have something to fear. But you're safe here..."" That makes no sense. You must be VERY physically strong to do this & since there is a huge lack of teaching of foot placement, you should know many poses by heart & do them correctly w/o verbal help. He at times doesn't even say the name of the poses. Yes, I noticed him showing off doing the more advanced poses or a subliminal, ""Hey, I can do it easy, you should to, or you're a wimp. Oh wait, you can? Oh... well, I'm still better..."" Yeah, it's easier for him because 60% of the time he's walking around touching everyone.
As other reviewer's said about his inappropriateness, it's true. Many times I saw him touching the female students very close to between their thighs & I had to rewind when he was stroking one girls' chest & practically rubbing her breasts & even stroked between her breasts. Yes, he did get distracted by his wife's tattoo which isn't as bad, but since he does live w/her you'd think he wouldn't be distracted by it with 6 students & many camera crew all watching/listening to his every word as he teaches. And yes, in comparison, I watched closely, he wouldn't touch the men as long & also would touch them correctly at the shoulder nowhere near the chest, etc. During a standing split, he was right along two women at different times & had them bend their knee to grab their foot with their hand, but their leg would be WRAPPED around his body & he would pull their hand so it's wrapped around his waist. I agree, again, there is no flow, therefore, no body awareness in the way he constructed the series of asanas.
No, I could not finish this, but I watched most of it to see if I liked the style to bother to keep it for when I am stronger.

Extras:
All set on a stage with a mic directly over the person doing the poses.
Practice Vinyasa - 10 min - Mark instructing his wife doing part of a vinyasa with half moon, warrior 3, crescent, standing split, side bends & seated spinal twist & more & one side only. Great cuing & energy, she breathes well with good body awareness. Wish he would put out workouts like that with him & wife alone. Or maybe I'd would just love to see yoga videos of her alone.
Instructional Poses - 10 min - Mark guiding different women who are doing a couple of random asanas each & at first helping verbally & physically moving their body, then just silently adjusts which is of little help. Several times, especially when the always female students are doing pyramid pose, he's behind them, his chest along their entire back, if they were nude.. forget it... He does NOT need to get that close.
Pushing the Envelope - 20 min - Mark doing a series of different asanas that fade in/out from being filmed different days. In a voice over, he says the poses, some helpful hints on poses & mostly critiques himself on how he compressed different body parts incorrectly so you can learn how not to do it.

Pros: honest in filming of struggle/sweat, good production values, great energy by his Wife, Elizabeth, he does seem playful & cares for her which is palpable & good to see, great advanced poses that I'd never seen before & refreshing, the verbal clues he does give are spiritual
Cons: he's constantly distracted by thoughts of sex w/the students, he's verbal teaching could be much more detailed, he's idea of encouragement at times makes no sense or is subliminally discouraging, there is no rhyme or reason to course of poses, therefore I doubt his body awareness which is essential to any true yoga instructor who teaches mind/body connection

I love Elizabeth's energy in this, when is she making a dvd of her own?

2455506,3,B000CC2GW6,"This is a tough one for me to review.  I love yoga, and was really looking for a challenging workout to do at home like I get at studios, as most yoga videos I have tried were not very challenging.  Plus I liked the idea of 3 videos to mix it up, so I got these over a year ago.

If you like the usual atmosphere of yoga (very serene, etc) I am not so sure about Blanchard, as he is not very soothing as others have mentioned.  But that can be overlooked if it was a great workout.

I think the key comment though that several reviewers have mentioned is that there is not a lot of flow in these videos.  As others mentioned, he does a lot of really challenging arm and half moon balance sequences that are held for a long time that require a lot of muscle strength.  Even if you have done yoga quite a bit and are fairly strong, you will still need to work up to these sections.  The challenge and the sweat from these videos seem to be more from holding these difficult positions, rather than flowing from many different positions to get your heart rate up, as other types of yoga do.  I think these are fundamentally different styles of yoga (hatha versus vinyasa, or other sytles, etc) so I am not necessarily faulting Blanchard, but when I get to a section that I am just not strong enough for, the consequence is that I would just end up sitting out those portions.  I think thats why I don't like these videos that much.

i will keep trying them however and re-review if I change my mind.",1200009600,4,1495,4.1923076923076925
2455507,4,B000CC2GW6,"I worked out to The Trilogy, the DVD series Mark Blanchard made before this one, for 1,5 years. Doing one workout each week. At a certain point I was looking out for something new, so I decided to purchase The Sedona Experience. While the Trilogy consisted of three ""all in"" yoga workouts, in The Sedona Experience each DVD emphasizes a specific aspect of Power Yoga practice.
Another difference is the length of the workouts. The Sedona Experience DVD's vary in length from 48 minutes (The Core) to 137 (The Culmination). Being able to choose from workouts with different lengths comes in handy if your schedule doesn't allow you the time to workout for a full 1,5 hours. As far as I can see, there is no need to do the DVD's in any particular order.

SETTING
You have to give it to him: filming his workouts in the natural beauty of New Age Mecca Sedona was a great move. Without getting into New Age ramblings about ""power places"" the prospect of practicing yoga in that setting must have been a powerful experience, though you won't feel much of that at home. While the setting of the Trilogy was not very inspirational, the mysterious red rock formations and crystal clear blue sky of these DVD's is a definitive plus. The good looking nicely shaved ladies in the front of the class might appeal to some as well.

THE WORKOUTS
""The Foundation"" is a basic 1,5 hour yoga workout. ""The Stretch"" is a one hour yoga workout is which the stretching aspect is slightly stressed. ""The Core"" is the most specific of the workouts in that about half of it is dedicated to (pretty demanding) abdominal exercises. ""The Flow"" is a one hour Yoga workout that is slightly cardio oriented. ""The Culmination"" is a long hardcore Power Yoga session with headstands, etc.

EXTRAS
The Extra's consist of the different Power Yoga moves broken down, but without commentary, and different soundscapes like a Sedona Sunrise that might be handy if you want to quiet your mind.

CONCLUSION
Yes, some of Blanchard's corrections of the female students do look like postures from the Kama Sutra (that's a kind of yoga too, I suppose...). But the bottom line is that these are enjoyable workouts. I thought a lot about whether to give this DVD set 3 or 4 stars. But the scenery does it, hence the 4 stars. Namaste.",1189036800,,2287,4.653465346534653
2455508,2,B000CC2GW6,"It is probably a misnomer to even call these DVDs ""yoga"".  The postures may be largely drawn from yoga but that is all.  This is a purely physical workout completely devoid of any soul.

These workouts are not for the beginner and are in the strong intermediate to advanced range.  It would also be a good idea to have done some yoga classes beforehand because Blanchard pays no attention whatsoever to form and alignment and you will not learn how to do an asana properly from these DVDs.  I found the way that Blanchard tells you to do some of the poses to be quite unsafe for all but the strongest of us and could result in injury. His verbal cues are also weak and confusing and you have to keep looking at the screen to see what he is doing.

As for the teacher himself, the guy is a major pain in the [...] and has a massive ego.  His adjustments of the female students are totally inappropriate and border on molestation and I found his constant fondling of his wife to be totally out of place and served to underline the fact that this guy is just not serious about yoga, his whole focus is on physicality.

If you are physically fit and strong, looking for a straight workout and can overlook the teacher, you may enjoy these DVDs.  If you are looking for strong yoga with soul, I would recommend Baron Baptiste or go and find yourself a good ashtanga class.",1187654400,5,1367,4.350393700787402
2455509,3,B000CC2GW6,"This is a review of the culmination dvd.  It does what it says it will do which is to cook your muscles.  Personally, I don't like to work this hard in a yoga class; a dance class yes, yoga class no.  Mark is not a good teacher in that he doesn't call out the poses.  When you do a Shiva Rea dvd, you don't have to look at the screen, just listen to her voice, a very nice voice at that.  I also had a problem with how touchy feely Mark was with the scantily clothed blonde yogini.  He rubbed and stroked her and flirted with her throughout the entire dvd.  What about the other students.  I dislike it when teacher pay attention to the good students when they really should be giving special attention to the students who look like they need help. There were a couple of students on this dvd who could have used Mark's corrections.  But no, he stayed close to blondie rubbed her on the back and said, I quote ""Gee you must be burning up inside babe.""  He and Bryan Kest with his crotch candy remarks are in the ""Inappropriate things male yoga teachers say"" club.

The dvd is filmed on the red rocks of sedona.  Nice scenery, but it looked uncomfortable to the students. Will I do this again.  Jury's out, as I said I don't like to work this hard at doing yoga.  If power yoga is your thing, and you don't mind Mark's inappropriateness, then this is the dvd for you.  I'll stick to kundalini yoga and Shiva Rea.",1187395200,5,1411,4.212686567164179
2455510,3,B000CC2GW6,"I have a gazillion yoga DVDs and recently bought these because I wanted a really tough power yoga workout.  Well, this disappoints.  I had read how tough they were, and there just isn't enough flow to really get your heartrate up and break a sweat.  I find Shiva Rea's DVDs to be better overall in getting in a good sweat, even Bryan Kest's and Baron Baptiste's are better than this.

I will say that these DVDs have a good balance of postures.  You will get some flow (though not enough in my opinion to be a ""power"" DVD), and a nice compliment of standing and stretching poses on the floor.  I think most people think these are tough because of all the arm balances, which is great but most people can't do them.",1185235200,5,714,4.330827067669173
2455511,2,B000CC2GW6,"(This review for the first of the five Blanchard Power Yoga DVDs)

The Good: A long workout (120mns), really hitting the legs. Background and practitioners are pleasant to look at. (You'll see why this was noted as a plus...)

The Bad: This yoga practice just doesn't flow. At all. Blanchard fails to call out poses by name consistently-making the viewer look at the screen much too often. Some poses are repeated over and over, making the routine seem.... monotonous.

The Verdict: Borrow it from the library. Borrow it from a friend. But don't buy it without going through it once or twice. While the workout is lengthy and intense on the legs, Blanchard fails as a good instructor.

Full Review: This is a classroom ""type"" DVD, with some pretty practitioners. Not that I mind that the women are attractive - but it seems like they chose ""pretty"" people versus real practitioners. Anyhow, I digress. While Blanchard is purely concerned with talking about the poses-a good thing in an of itself, he doesn't call out poses by name enough. He talks about bending limbs this way, and falling that way-but you don't know what pose he's guiding you towards until you break down and look at the screen.

After the first half, I was really frustrated because I like to practice yoga-not continually watch the screen to see what the instructor intended. You know a great yoga practice if you can perform it by listening to the instructor, occasionally glancing at them. Why can't Blanchard just say ""Standing forward bend, standing back bend, side plank, crow""? Because he only calls out the poses about half the time-I'm left to decipher his unclear instructions, which is not what I'm in this for. This becomes very apparent, as you can see the entire class having varying difficulty keeping pace with what he's describing-having to look up to see what he's going for.

Blanchard uses a ""hands on"" approach with some students, something not everyone will appreciate. I find it mildly amusing that he wanders off course and starts to describe the set scenery and how happy your dog is. I know this is ""progressive"" yoga, but really?

The balancing poses are interesting, some new that I haven't seen before-which were a breath of freshness. He seems strangely partial to three-legged dog and one legged balances. About 50 minutes into the workout, the ""view"" changes, spreading out the practitioners. At first I thought this would be be nice-but because I had to look at the screen so often, it was even more distracting. As the people were spread out, it was blatantly obvious that they could not follow without looking at Blanchard - a true statement to how well he can coordinate the workout. The last half hour approaches some more balancing, strength, backbends/shoulderstands, and some hip-openers.

The real detriment is the instructor. ""Bring this hand to the earth, that hand up to the sky."" Hey Blanchard, how about saying half-moon pose? It's also apparent that Blanchard can't even do many of the poses very well. Call me old fashioned, but the teacher needs to be able to demonstrate what they teach.

If it wasn't for the few one-legged balancing poses I hadn't seen before, two stars would have been two-too many.",1185062400,14,3222,4.864963503649635
2455512,4,B000CC2GW6,"I found this series to be sweat inducing, flexibility improving, and strenghening. Let's face it, some classes are so focussed on form, that a student can approach yoga hesitantly for fear of doing something ""wrong"" or incorrectly. These sessions really allow you to keep flowing in the vinyasa, which is great, since the benefit in vinyasa lies not in the perfection and form, but the repetition. It's okay if you don't practice perfectly. Your muscles will get so warmed, that you will improve as you go along.

However...the same attributes which make this series great also provide the series with its greatest weak points. There is really very little attention given to form and alignment. In a way, the instrutor doesn't really teach or instruct, but rather directs which movements to do. He doesn't teach you how to do them properly. He just tells you what to do. In addition to that, the viewer may have difficulty following his direction.  For example, instead of specifying which leg or specifically where to place something (i.e.,place your right foot next to your right hand), he uses phrases like ""this leg...put it right here""

Again, I found these sessions challenging and very motivating. As a yoga instructor, I think it is very positive and important to switch up your routine and challenge your mind and body to a different kind of body, even sometimes forgoing the laser beam emphasis on form and precision for a fun and different kind of practice. Simply remember that form is important and work on it on your own or incorporate it into your sessions while you are watching this series on television.",1182816000,,1621,4.887272727272728
2455513,5,B000CC2GW6,"Received the set as a gift; had only a vague interest in trying yoga, but finally decided to at least look at these. I was fascinated by what the body can do! At first I just watched (they're really beautifully done), and eventually I started slowly, trying the positions I thought I might be able to do. Over this past year I have worked up to trying many more, and actually, I feel physically different - heartier.",1182124800,2,416,4.415584415584416

2455515,5,B000CC2GW6,"These DVD's are definitely not for those who want to just ""stretch""... I've been using Mark's DVDs for a while not and I absolutely love them.  Each one is a different workout and it never gets old no matter how many times I do it.  I try to go to his classes as often as possible (when I'm in LA) but these DVDs are a great alternative.  I've given them to my girlfriends (and guy friends) as gifts and they love them too.  I definitely recommend this!",1177977600,4,453,4.172413793103448
2455516,4,B000CC2GW6,"This set includes 3 DVD's. A short talk by Mark Blanchard kicks off every DVD. The workouts on the first and second one are 94 minutes long, the third 99 minutes. This is a long time to work out, but if you're serious about practicing Yoga, these DVD's are for you.

Every workout is different, though about half of each consists of postures like Upward and  Downward Dog that are repeated throughout most of the tapes. Each tape ends with a lying meditation. The workouts are very challenging (some postures are so difficult that some might find the workouts frustrating) with postures that include standing on your head, elbows and feet. I bought this set more than a year ago and do one of these workouts each week and can now stand on my head, though not on my elbows or hands. As Mark says: ""it might take you two, three or four times. Or two, three or four years"". Mark explains a bit more about Yoga during the workouts.

Conclusion: these are tough workouts and it will probably take years before you are able to do everything Mark does in them, but if you're in for a challenge and not afraid of some exertion these are great DVD's  to own. In my experience they are Progressively more fun the more you do them.",1173052800,2,1220,4.433035714285714

It's a great stretch and workout and makes you SWEAT!! You sure will feel it the next day.

But, it is a rare occasion that I finish the whole tape as I get so fatigued, it is 90 minutes long, usually I do half of it. The end half though he starts getting into practice poses which you may never accomplish, he even states it with many of the poses done. 40 minutes of strenuous yoga is enuf for me.

2455519,5,B000CC2GW6,"These DVD's are some of the best Power Yoga videos out there.  Mark has a great sense of humor and reminds us not to take things too seriously.  You won't feel frustrated when you can't do a pose the first, second or even the third time you try it.  I now laugh at myself when I fall down in my practice.  I have noticed not only a huge improvement in my physical appearance, but I am much more grounded, able to breath through stressful situations, and have allowed myself to welcome change into my life.  The series is perfect for my fiance and I when we're traveling and can't make it to our favorite studio.  Mark's approach to Yoga is one that invites anyone to practice.  My mother has even done the DVD's with me and loved them.

On a side note, I think the very hostile person that wrote the review before me should find a way to release all that anger.  May I suggest Mark Blanchard's Progressive Power Yoga???  Yoga is also about acceptance and having an open heart.  Namaste.",1153180800,7,986,4.362637362637362

A great instructor is Brian Kest. His voice bothers some people, but at least he generates a positive mental energy that helps all those who take his class go deeper into their Yoga practice.

2455521,5,B000CC2GW6,"When my girlfriend bought me Mark's DVDs a year ago, I have to admit I snickered under my breath and thanked her politely. I did not think there was anything in yoga for me. I could not have been more wrong. My first attempt at doing these dvds left me sore in all the right places and there were clearly things I could not do. But that is what is so cool about these dvds. Mark shot a class with all levels of students in it and I have to admit that it was encouraging to see that they were not all doing every pose perfectly. Mark is the consumate instructor and just when you feel like pulling back, he always seems to say the right thing to make you stay in the game and keep practicing.

Three months later, it is like I had a body makeover. I was so much more flexible than I was when I was going to the gym for my whole workout, and my bike riding, tennis and even my golf was really improving! For me, it was the focus. It was the way to make the gears stop spinning in my head and put my entire concentration into whatever it is that I am setting my mind to now. What Mark says on his site about improving your focus is an understatement, for me at least. My serve has never been more impactful than since I started practicing Mark's DVDs.

I just bought his new Sedona Series and I have to say, in a word, Spectacular! Kudos Mark, these are so powerful, visual, and I have never enjoyed a workout more than the experience of doing your programs in Sedona. The scenery is breathtaking, I must go there soon!!

So for all you who come upon Mark Blanchard's Progressive Power Yoga DVDs, you should know, I started with no yoga experience. It was not an easy workout at all.... but I never felt anything less than elated after practicing whatever I could do on a given day. I do them all now, and find new challenges each time I come to the mat. I have to say honestly that my girlfriend was right, Mark's Yoga was really for me afterall...and I have never felt better! But don't tell her I ever admitted it! I still tell her the bike is the source of endurance...truth is, if you can endure these workouts, you can endure anything you set your mind to. After I got hooked on these, I tried Bryan Kest, Rodney Yee, Baron Baptiste, even Shiva... but I did not seem to connect with them the same way that I do when I am doing one of Mark's workouts. I tell all my friends, but most don't believe me until I pass them on the uphill on my bike rides... then I think I get their attention...these are the real deal. You should try em.",1147564800,17,2535,4.1483739837398375
2455522,5,B000CC2GW6,"If you want to buy a yoga dvd, Mark Blanchard's dvds are the best.  Even his new Arizona ones are brilliant.  You cannot get a workout any better than this.  These dvds work every muscle in your body, including your abdominals and neck/spine muscles, and the poses go beyond beginners level, so it's good for any level student.  It takes a couple times to get used to the workout, but once you get the hang of it, you will lose weight quickly and tone up and align every muscle in your body to the point of sincere pain the next day; good pain (as Blanchard says, ""the kind that makes you smile""), as opposed to the bad kind you get with weight lifting.  If I had infinite thumbs, that's how many Blanchard would get.  It truly brings out the athlete in you by developing functional muscles that also look good!  Much better than Rodney Yee or Brian Kest's workouts, simply because of the increased difficulty level and the speed of the workout; Blanchard moves more subtly between poses and you will definitely appreciate this when you see the difference.  I have yet to learn much about Baron Baptiste however, but I hear good things.",1144972800,9,1136,4.534313725490196
2455523,5,B000CC2GW6,"As an avid outdoor cross trainer, I had an aversion to working out indoors.  But when mother nature whould choose to rain on my parade, I had to find another way.  A friend introduced me to Mark Blanchard's Power Yoga. Having never done Yoga before, I was more than a bit skeptical.  I had this preconceived notion of a wiry old bearded man gently humming in a room with wafting incense.  Boy was I suprised!

Not only was I physically challenged, but the tapes themselves made me feel as if I was in the class I was watching.  As Blanchard moves about the class, his presence comes through the screen.  I was hooked!  But before I purchased his DVD, I tried other yoga workout DVD's, just to make sure this was the program for me.  NONE COULD COMPARE!

With Mark Blanchard's Power Yoga, I didn't need to see if I was using the right ""level of Yoga"" for me. It didn't matter. Plus  Blanchard's enthusiasm for Yoga genuine.  Which is more than I can say for the feeling I got from the other yoga DVD's by the ""name brand Yogi's"".

Bottom line is, Mark Blanchard's Power Yoga, made a believer out of me.  BRAVO!  And job well done!!",1143676800,10,1130,4.365384615384615
2455524,5,B000CC2GW6,"As a yoga teacher and a long-time practitioner with Mark Blanchard, these are the videos I personally practice with at home and recommend to all of my students.  The videos are only as difficult as you make them and are for everyone, no matter where you are in your yoga.  As Mark says, ""Just come to the mat honestly and do the best you can do.""  It doesn't matter what you can do or what you can't do. Whatever you can do is enough.  It's not about being able to do the whole practice perfectly, and you will see that with Mark himself in the videos.  It's not about judging yourself or anyone else in the practice, but accepting where you are on your own journey.  Mark's videos offer a complete practice, allowing you to work on opening the body and the mind in ways you may never have dreamed of.  They are all about bringing the body and mind into balance and ultimately your life into balance.  Mark's sense of humor and honesty is refreshing.  He is a true modern yogi who is always honest and true to himself and honors this 5,000 year old practice.",1143417600,8,1058,4.32994923857868
2455525,5,B000CC2GW6,"Mark Blanchard is by far the most challenging instructor I have seen in the yoga world. I have done many exercise and yoga tapes in the past, and I can say, hands down, he physically pushes you like no other. My body and mind have transformed in such a positive way that I won't be giving up his practice any time soon. I took these DVD's to Fiji with me over vacation knowing that I would be over indulging with meals and sugary drinks. I didn't gain any weight at all! I came back from my trip possibly looking better than when I left, and won the limbo contest thanks to him! I'm strong, flexible, and more open-minded since this experience, and am very grateful to have something physically challenging in my life that is fun and positive!",1143331200,8,743,4.391304347826087
2455526,4,B000CC2GW6,"This is a tough set to review - they are the most complete and physically challenging yoga videos that I know of, and can provide a wonderful workout, but Mark Blanchard's personality can also be challenging and even irritating to some people.  My sense is that Mark, like a lot of us, struggles with his urge to be competitive and dominant, and that competitive streak emerges in these tapes as he seems unconsciously to want to beat down his students (including his wife) and show his own mastery.  He has a history as a would-be actor and athlete, and inadvertently brings a sort of Hollywood ego / jock competitiveness to his yoga.

The tapes are filled with little moments where his ego seems to take control - I'll give just one example.  There is a moment when Blanchard and his wife are side-by-side while jumping through from downward dog into staff pose.  Blanchard happens to catch his foot on the floor and can't do the movement the first time, but his wife is able to do the movement perfectly.  Blanchard gets a vexed look on his face, and stops the flow of poses to make the class do the movement again and again until no one has the strength left to do the movement except for him.  He looks around at the class (and his wife) while balancing on his hands as if to be sure that everyone can see that he's the strongest.  Then, with his dominance restored, he allows the class to go on.

Because of all the moments like this, the discs are a mixed bag.  Blanchard is a good teacher, and the movements he puts together are powerful and satisfying at a physical level.  I also believe that Blanchard is struggling genuinely to serve others through yoga, and to overcome his personal limitations.  Over time, however, the emotional dynamics between Blanchard, his wife and the rest of the class become distracting and even a little disturbing.

None of us is perfect, of course, and it comes down to a matter of taste whether the intangible elements in these discs will  keep you from enjoying the excellent physical movements they teach.",1142208000,121,2050,4.596153846153846

I am in an intermediate class now, among the more advanced students, so I expected to be able to do most of the asanas on this series.  In reality most of the exercises are too difficult for me ... so I had to put it up on a shelf.... may be one day I will be able to do it.

2455530,5,B000CC2GW6,"**This Review Is For The Whole Series In General**
I was surprised to see this on amazon, it was previously available only at his website which is where I bought it. This is the TOUGHEST yoga I had ever done and I have a big collection of yoga videos from Bryan Kest to Shiva Rea to Baron Baptiste and more. Each one of the dvd's has more than 90 minutes yoga practice which is thorough and tough , it's starts with about 60 minute of intense standing poses with vinyasas in between and some arm balances thrown in and then a 30 minutes of seated potures and some ab work ,inversions, headstand and savasana. Each DVD is similar in structure but each one offers some different poses from the other to prevent boredom in the practice as they suggest in the advertisement , so this series does not offer different level practices that progresses gradually although you may find one easier than the other .They suggest it's for all people and all levels (probably to increase sales) but I think it will be too much for beginners and people who are not in good shape and even for intermediates because this is a real hardcore practice , the pace in most of the workouts is pretty moderate except some push ups & jump bursts that creates heat and strength in the upper body ,but some of the poses are held long, like the half moon series, which really makes your leg and rear muscles scream. Each dvd also has a 30 minute instructional segment in which he gives some pointers and modifications for some of the poses (this segment is identical in all of the dvds).The set is simple and even a little cheap looking (not very important) ,there's a few studetns of all genders and ages including Mark's mom and a kid and from time to time he'll be checking they're doing the poses correctly ,most of the time he'll be doing the practice with them, also ther'es no music in the background. So if you want a long and challenging yoga practices you'll probbably like this series.",1136678400,8,1967,4.481894150417827

I cannot do every move in this practice, but I am able to continuously work towards improvement with this program.

8096783,5,B000CC2GW6,"I loved this DVD the very first time I tried it.  This is the only prenatal Yoga DVD that made me feel like I worked out afterwards.  I am a runner, I take spin classes, spend an hour on the elliptical; I've always preferred cardio over Yoga.  But now approaching my 8th month of pregnancy, I need something slower and less impact and this Yoga DVD is it.  I actually can get my heart pumping during the DVD.  I can see doing this after my baby is born and getting a good workout.
I think that Mark is a great instructor.  The music and instruction are easy to listen to, unlike most Yoga DVDs that I've tried.  The hour-long workout seems to fly by.
The only thing I am concerned about is the amount of time spent on your back at the end of the DVD.  I don't know that it presents a hazard, but it can get uncomfortable if you have back issues.",1360022400,,845,4.109756097560975

At one point he is pulling hairs off a student and saying, ""ooh you have a lot of hair hun."" It seemed like some kind of 1950's BS of this big man teaching these women how to do yoga because they must have no idea. The women are at times off balance and look like they will fall and of course he doesn't notice. He does upward dog with them which feels horrible and does absolutely not one adaptation for their pregnant bodies. It makes me very angry!! If you are pregnant and in shape just get a Vinyasa yoga video or get a real pregnancy yoga DVD.",1320796800,,714,4.181159420289855

These tapes are a great way create balance, strength, and relaxation in life. Some of the moves are impossible for me right now but Mark reminds me that it may take me 4 days or 4 years (I am thinking more like 14 years) to reach that point. Either way, the purpose is to focus on the present and appreciate what my body can do today which is a good thought for life as well. There are a few advanced moves but most of the tapes can be attempted by any level. However, to do the moves as they are done by the students in this class, one would need some substantial Yoga experience. I would not reccommend this series for first time Yogees but I also would not reserve it only for the advanced. Namaste!",1311724800,,871,4.190476190476191
