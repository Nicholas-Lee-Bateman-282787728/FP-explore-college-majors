7831023,2,6302734606,"I hate to be a downer, but this was a really bad way for Robert Clouse to close his filmmaking career. The man who introduced first Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan to American film audiences might have never regained the prestige he won via&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/B00BPJ5Z96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>, but he didn't make very many bad movies and definitely deserved to end his tenure as a director with a bang. ""Ironheart"" is more of a weak fizz, and justly collects dust in obscurity.

The story: When his partner is murdered while investigating a human trafficking circuit, a tough policeman (Britton Lee) picks up the case on his own.

Foremost, be aware that even though Bolo Yeung is featured on the cover, he is not the star of the movie. He's actually the lead enforcer for the villain, played by good old Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-O-Brien/dp/B000F3WBKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China O'Brien</a>). Neither of them is utilized particularly well: Bolo does what's expected of an intimidating, stoic, muscular minion but only gets in on a single fight, (SPOILER) whereas Norton unexpectedly doesn't play a martial artist at all and his character consequently suffers a most embarrassing death.  Poor Britton Lee, who's since fallen from the face of the earth, might have thought this film would turn him into a new action hero, but his dreadful acting may have contributed to his lack of future film roles. He actually reminds me of Leo Fong - younger, slimmer, and more agile, but with the same awkward dramatic style and daydreaming comportment.

There's a decent amount of martial arts action, but you have to wait a while for it. The seven fights of substance do not captivate at all: Britton's clearly got an aptitude for kicks, but the same awkward editing and cruddy camera angles have ruined brawls more promising than his. The showdown between Bolo and him is the longest and most even battle, but it's merely passable and far from Yeung's best work. There's actually more dancing than fighting in the movie: a dance club is one of the central locations, and no less than six scenes predominantly center on various extras in 80s attire showing their moves (disappointingly, neither Britton nor Norton or Bolo ever get down).

The movie's meandering pace ensures that only tolerant viewers will be able to keep their attention on it, at which point it may be enjoyable on account of its sporadic acts of weirdness - like when Lee pretends to be a drunk bum and somehow manages to con guards into opening a locked door for him. I can't recommend a film on that merit alone, and I don't suggest that you invest in it, either. I'm sorry, Robert, but I promise that we'll remember you for your other work.",1424908800,,2870,5.203463203463204

7831025,2,6302734606,"Bolo Yeung is about the only thing that makes this movie even worth checking out.  This is not one of his better outings, but he does play the villain, as usual.  Ironheart is a pretty boring movie that moves slowly.  Britton K. Lee plays a cop whose mission is to discover who killed his partner and who is behind a kidnapping of young women at a local night club.  There are few fights in the movie and most are unimpressive, even the final fight with Bolo Yeung could have been much more exciting.  Most of the movie consists of going from place to place, trying to unravel the mystery.  Britton K. Lee is nothing spectacular.  Though he shows a few martial arts skills, his character is very bland.  The cheesiness and acting in Ironheart is just as bad as any poor martial arts movie and the night club scene at the beginning is about the silliest thing ever.

If not for Bolo Yeung, this movie would be about the most boring of its kind.  Bolo fans might be disapointed, but he's had worse roles (Fearless Tiger).",1155945600,,1019,4.43010752688172
