2762955,5,B000NA278K,Meatball Machine is an awesome flick...at least for people who are into bizarre and gory movies such as myself.  We need to have more movies like this.  It would be great to see a sequel.,1185321600,3,187,4.314285714285714
2762956,5,B000NA278K,"Director Jun'ichi Yamamoto makes an interesting film on the take with aliens and humans battling each other. Here we have a couple of aliens that battle with each other. Then the aliens also have hosts that attached themselves to humans and morph them into warriors.

There is a side story about a nerd, Muraishi, who is in love with a girl named Misawa. The two share a lot of things in common including the fact that they are both lonely and shy. Muraishi finds a dead alien creature (or so he thinks back to his place). By chance he meets Misawa on a date with a jerk. The two go back to his place and tell their feelings toward one another much to his surprise. However, Muraishi has made the mistake of still keeping the creature at his place. The alien hosts becomes alive and attaches himself into Misawa and makes her vicious alien like ther rest of his race.

The special effects for this flick are very well done and the creature effects too. There is a long scene of where we see the alien host invading themselves to the human's body in graphic fashion. It's graphic, realistic and very bizaree. There are other surprises into how the hosts operate but I'am not going to spoil it.

If you want a decent alien sci-fi movie and you are sick of the low budget badly directed and acting Hollywood stuff you definitely will want to give ""Meatball Machine"" a try.

This movie was definitel unlike anything I've ever seen and it has everything that a lot of sci-fi and horror fans will like. The acting was decent too. If you're into an entertaining sci-film with lots of gore you'll love this movie.

Lots of action and gore so be prepared this movie very much uses the in your face type of camera action that makes this Japanese flicks really noticable.",1181865600,3,1760,4.4875
2762957,5,B000NA278K,I love asian films and even more love the ones filled with gore. This one is great and filled with plenty of gore and blood.

2762958,3,B000NA278K,"Back in 1992 Olaf lttenbach came out with a movie called ""The Burning Moon"" I've seen it. It wipes the floor when it comes to gore. ""The Meatball Machine"" was ok but I've was not really impressed. Heck the eyeball scene in ""Hostel"" was a whole lot better than the whole movie of ""Meatball Machine. I did like the concept of aliens taking over human bodys but that's been done before. I know it is very hard, very hard to find but if you can find a VHS copy (It isn't on DVD) ""The Burning Moon"" is the gore movie to see.

2762959,1,B000NA278K,"I really didn't know they still made movies this bad! I'm a hardcore horror film buff that grew up in the 80's and have watched and enjoyed many low budget sci-fi and horror films over the decades. Although, i wasn't expecting John Carpenters ""The Thing"", I was expecting something more solid based on what other reviewers had gushed over with this title. This movie was made on a shoe-string budget and it shows. While some of the ideas were good, the execution is so poor that it has the look and feel of a particularly bad student flick. Even Peter Jacksons ""Bad Taste"" made 20 years earlier (if I'm comparing ""how to entertain on a budget"") absolutely stomps all over this steaming pile of crap! Many of the so called shock ""gore-effects"" that others have commented on are unconvincing and of the ""rubber"" variety. I couldn't watch the last 15 minutes, not because the film was too shocking, but was simply a waste of my time. Hardcore horror buffs looking for a fix WON'T find it here!!",1254787200,3,991,4.604519774011299
2762960,4,B000NA278K,"Before there was ""Tokyo Gore Police"" and ""Machine Girl"", there was ""MEATBALL MACHINE"" (2005). Co-written and co-directed by Yudai Yamaguchi (along with Junichi Yamamoto), is an experimental film that blends horror, Japanese Blood-Splattering elements, science fiction, romance, post-apocalypticism and a whole lot of blood and GORE. The film is insane and is a remake of the short film that carries the same title in 1999. Quite complex and yet so simple in its storyline, it's the type of film that relies heavily on body disfigurement and a `cyberpunk' backdrop.

Muraishi Yoji (Issei Takahashi), loner who is also a machine worker at a local warehouse harbors feelings for the next door factory worker named Sachiko Misawa (Aoba Kawai). After being beaten up by a transvestite after he rejects his advances at a theater, Yoji finds a golden object that resembles a turtle shell that secretes an alien-like semen. Curiosity takes the best of the young man and he takes it home to examine. Shortly after, Yoji stumbles upon Sachiko who is in danger of being raped by Tanaka (Kenichi Kawasaki), one of his co-workers. Yoji intervenes and gets beaten up by Tanaka, and the kindly Sachiko takes Yoji to his home. His wounds cleaned by Sachiko, Yoji finds some connection with the lovely young woman. But to his horror, Sachiko is attacked by the turtle-like alien shell that turns her into a Necro-Borg; a living host controlled by an alien force to do battle with other groups. These alien race has been using humans as their hosts, enhancing them with organic weaponry whose power is based off anger and depression. Now Yoji must attempt to save the woman he loves, even if it means becoming a necro-borg himself...

""Meatball Machine"" actually has a very simple premise; a group of parasitic alien races battling each other for supremacy with humans as pawns may have been done many times before, but when you combine the first half of the film, directors Yamaguchi and Yamamoto is able to find a heart amid all the madness. The film brings the total alienation and loneliness of its two main leads. Sachiko and Yoji are both repressed individuals, they have had their share of bad luck in their lives. Most specifically Sachiko had been sexually abused by her own father while Yoji also has his own sad tale to tell. You see the characters' sense of despair, pain and sadness, and therefore since this is a Japanese film, it does contain a strong commentary about negative emotions taking hold which may lead one to destruction. It also hits on some subtle hints of obsessive parental love as portrayed by an insane scientist and his daughter Michino (played by nude model Erika Sato).

The cyber-enhancements are similar to those seen in ""Tetsuo the Iron Man"" and they are massive, resembling the rubber suits of the aliens in ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" and ""Ultraman"". The transformation sequences are bizarre, as the alien sphere attaches itself to its human host; they come complete with alien secretions, old-fashioned gore effects and arterial sprays. Yes, ""Meatball Machine"" has blood and gore in the bucket loads, there's drills, entrails...you name it. Much of the splattering blood and gore happen in the film's fight scenes, with limbs being severed and bodies being disemboweled. It pleases me that the filmmakers have shunned the use of CGI in favor of the old-fashioned red ink and prosthetics. While its old school approach is part of its B-movie sensibilities, some folks not adulterated to the Japanese style filmmaking may become alienated.

Truth be told, the action scenes aren't as good as those seen in ""Machine Girl"" and ""Tokyo Gore Police"". They aren't as crazy and enthralling, but this film was before those other two films so I can excuse its somewhat lacking in raw craziness. Also, the film doesn't exactly use its best aces to its utmost potential--a Necro-borg fight with a lot of spectators present would've been awesome. I also thought that the filmmakers focused too much on the gore effects that the story was a little downplayed, and in the end, the love between Sachiko and Yoji wasn't fully brought into exposition. I wished that the script didn't telegraph itself a little too early, the story just didn't go full circle as much as I would've liked.

While ""Meatball Machine"" would be a little underwhelming when compared to the best of Japanese splatter fests, I still thought that it has enough gore, blood and bizarre alien ooze to get a `recommended' rating from one educated in Japanese cinema. Part ""Tetsuo"" and part ""Ultraman"", it is still a good cyberpunk feature that offer some old and new to the genre. It also carries some weird testament to the power of true love; wild, weird and definitely insane, the film doesn`t let up until the final climactic fight. ""Meatball Machine"" is complex, outrageously exaggerated, and it would be insane to say that this is a ""standard"" movie in the eyes of mainstream audiences. It is still refreshing to see something different once in a while...

Recommended! [3  Stars]",1248480000,8,5064,4.950588235294117
2762961,5,B000NA278K,"Really, I don't have much more to say than just that. There's a thrown together story that explains why these people in huge Gwar-getups are brutally, viscerally fighting each other and then BAM. They're fighting. It's outrageous, it's violent, it's bloody, gorey, and it's wonderful. It's the perfect streamlined splatter film. The plot really does little more than establish the basic premise and motives of the characters and the rest is all mayhem of the over-the-top variety. Then it rounds out with the most bizarre exposition I've ever seen that goes on for somewhere around three to five minutes, but it was so bizarre I just couldn't be bored by it.

So that's Meatball Machine for you. You're set up with enough information to feel you know what's going down and then you just shut off your brain and watch the effects roll. Simple. Wonderful.",1245283200,,853,4.882758620689655
2762962,3,B000NA278K,"I bought this movie on a whim due to the line, ""'Plays like a gloriously bloody and R-rated version of the ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.""' --DVD Town""
While the fighting is pretty cheesy like MMPR, the plot is deliciously weak, there's very little character development, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. Gore and (off-screen) tentacle rape drive the story on this one, in case you couldn't guess.

The real stand-out feature is the drawn-out commentary from the cast. I could only make it through about 30 minutes of the commentary with a group of friends, but that's because the main point the whole cast was driving home was, ""We made the best movie we could with almost no budget, campy special effects, and an original cut that was so bad that a new director was called in to re-shoot parts of the movie."" - it was probably one of the best commentaries I've ever seen, especially after watching the movie.",1239408000,,920,4.714285714285714

2762964,3,B000NA278K,"The movie seems made on a cheep budget for its time, and its time was a while ago, but if you can get around the cheep looking gore and special effects and let your willing suspension of disbelief take you, this is a very nice movie to watch, fairly unique in the fact that it takes elements of kabuki theater in so far that the dialog is extra and does not really need to be heard to understand what is going on. some of the dvd extras do end up being rather racist but hey in the words of the dvd intro... ""sits got a boob in it.""",1235865600,,532,3.935185185185185
2762965,3,B000NA278K,"This film is one that relies on a classic Japanese cinema form known as Tokusatsu, or Kaiju.  ( Basically they are movies with large latex and Styrofoam monsters.)  Though the effects are campy they are well done, and the director takes the movie seriously and does a great job.  The movie is well acted and as you might expect from a movie called Meatball machine, that relies on monsters in latex...it is chalk full of crazy fight scenes.  The director takes his hat off to classic horror directors such as Sam Raimi, David Cronenburg, and so there is blood and gore galore.  The box of the dvd reads "" If you are not disturbed by this movie, then you should be incarcerated""  Now this movie is not for anyone who has no interest in Campy or Cult movies, but if cult flicks are up your ally And crazy mutant parasite aliens taking over human bodies, and then eating each other is your bag...then by all means...enjoy the meatball machine!!

2762966,4,B000NA278K,"So I just finished watching this, I was pumped about the great reviews and had just bought 'Machine Girl' and liked that alot, and was hopping for more blood and gore ext...... Hmmmm what to really say......?

If you watch the original short first and then watch film it will make it so much better o_O I was a bit disappointed in the over all movie, it lacked something I just don't know what it is.

Anyway 'Reject of Death' was awsome, if it had not been for that short film and I suppose it's the prequel to Meatball Machine, I would have given only 1 star maybe 2, sorry everyone who really enjoyed it, but thank God for Reject of Death, it made it worth buying the DVD.

Reject of Death I give 5 stars, It disturbed me, it made me LOL, and cry because it ended and was way to short, but I guess that's why they call it a short. Buy it just for Reject of Death.",1227657600,,866,4.08235294117647
2762977,4,B000NA278K,"You know the makers of the film are not taking themselves very seriously when the movie starts with two silhouetted monsters talking to each other.  Meatballs!  Tacos!  This introduction is in English with Japanese subtitles, but the movie itself is in the Japanese language with English subtitles.  The movie then starts with a fight scene between two cyborg creatures, the winner eating the other's strange heart-bulb.  The film starts bloody, runs bloody, and ends bloody.

Shy factory worker Yoji (a real weenie) has been watching a girl across the fence, but doesn't have the courage to introduce himself.  One night he catches a co-worker trying to rape the girl, Sachiko, in the park.  He tries to beat up the co-worker but fails, even though the man leaves Sachiko alone.  The two go back to Yoji's apartment where Yoji has one of the strange creatures in a travel bag.  He captured it in a pile of garbage after being beat up by a transvestite.  As Sachiko confesses her dark secret, the monster comes alive, jumps out of the closet, and rapes Sachiko before turning her into a cyborg creature.  Yoji of course does nothing, he's too scared.  He runs from Sachiko only to be knocked out and found on the streets by a strange man who lives in a crappy apartment and seems to be the only person in Japan who's aware of the monsters and knows what they're doing.  Then he turns Yoji into one of the monsters, but Yoji escapes to look for Sachiko.

That's the plot.  Very thin, but of course the movies isn't about the plot.  It's about hungry little buggers who like to eat each other and raise havoc.  It's about ropy tendrils, split heads, eye gouging, heart bulbs, slime, eyeball drills, gooey skeletons, and a little masturbation, a transvestite, and a prostitute for good measure.  We're also treated to a little ""monster vision"", seeing humans from the creature's eyes.  The aliens are funny, looking a little like a twisted beanie-baby with some goo thrown on it.  And, of course, it's about blood, blood, blood.

The photography is sketchy, using a lot of scene skipping and ""flashes"", the film isn't shot in video but it has the feel of video.  The dialogue is stilted, and the acting just mediocre, and the FX a little cheesy.  But you came here for blood and you'll get plenty of that.  I'm not a usual fan of Japanese or Asian horror films, but 'Meatball Machine' is one of the rare ones I liked.  With the humor thrown around the film like the blood, and some wild imagination with the cyborg creatures, it manages to raise itself from a typical foreign horror flick to something every type of horror fan can enjoy.  Rent first.  Enjoy!",1223596800,2,2655,4.663793103448276
2762978,4,B000NA278K,"The Good Things
*Grossest movie ever! Loads of blood and perversity! (Reminds me a lot of the anime show ""Gantz"").
*A few good gory fight scenes.
*Good filming style.  Lots of good camera angles.  Has a distinctive look and style.
*Production design is good.  Imagine the monsters from the ""Quake"" or ""Unreal"" computer games in a movie.
*Simple but interesting story.
*Surprisingly good characters.  Although many of them are perverts, the main character spends much of the film trying to act noble.
*Romance is not overwhelmingly sappy, and is touching at some parts.

The Bad Things
*The squeamish should avoid this like the plague.
*Pretty low production value (but the quality of the cinematography makes up for it).

Ah, so this is what ""Gantz"" looks like if it was a live-action movie! Not only are the two gory as hell, but they also share similar themes and attitudes of sexuality.  Plus, both deal with freaky aliens and stuff.  Unlike ""Gantz,"" however, this film works better at being scary and immersive.  This is definately one of the better B-rated movies I know of, but it's not for anybody with a weak stomach.

DVD has good video and sound quality, and contains a couple of featurettes, two additonal films (""Maximum Meatball Machine"" and ""The Original Meatball Machine""), and trailers.",1216512000,7,1302,4.95852534562212

I wasn't looking for a masterpiece, but I wasn't looking for a kids movie with gore added to it.  Some of the bloody goodness was awesome.

I think HER transormation was GREAT, and the story was very good however and I DO recommend it, but compared to today's gore-fests it is not as bad as the cover makes it seem. It has a lot of stop-action which is kinda old school and not gory to me.. again maybe I am jaded and just can look at it with a different perspective.

Bottom Line it is a really cool movie, -- a real love story-- but don't be scared off by the gory references.

A great silly title, for a great silly movie,
It's essentially a cross between ""Tesuo: the Iron"" and a Gwar video with an Evil Dead vibe going on.
Fetus-Aliens in their bizarre tentacle-ships attach themselves to people's chests and orifices,
and transform them into mechanical killing machines (called necroborgs)
hell-bent on eating each other,
which they need to do in order to live.
Sound wacky enough?
Well it is, but it's still very enjoyable.
Suprisingly, there's a love story here too.
But don't worry that doesn't detract from all the off-the-wall silliness.

Here's a few reasons you might want to catch this flick:
- Lots of great blood & gore, (eye-drilling, head-splitting, etc.)
- A whole bunch of wild battles,
- Bizarre transformations involving whipping red hoses and internal mayhem,
- Psychotic costumes
- Disgusting/gorgeous aliens
- All the campy laughs and blood you could possibly want.

I hear a lot of people comparing this movie to Tetsuo, and I completely understand where the comparisons come from, but they are infact two VERY different movies. I am a huge Tetsou fan but in my opinion this is a way more enjoyable film that should be taken very seriously by Horror and Sci-Fi fans.
Everything in this movie is excellent, the story is awesome and not hard to understand at all, the acting is top notch and works perfectly, it has so much creativity it is unbelievable, and this has some of the most impressive special effects I have ever seen in my life. The one flaw I could find is SOMETIMES the aliens look a little rubbery, but for every rubbery-looking alien there were ten more incredible effects to make me forget all about that.

I highly recommend this movie although it does have it's flaws, and it does borrorw heavily from Tetsuo, if you like to watch B-movie's with a brain opposed to A-movie's with pretty actresse's, big muscles, and no artistic merit whatsoever, then you should definitely pick this one up.

With everything from children being liquidated by oncoming traffic, to projectile vomit, to cross-dressing hookers, masturbation, and rape (both human and inhuman), the film pulls no punches in trying to shock and disturb its audience.
