8644706,1,B00IR4U010,Is not worth it. Just less than 20 minutes  of footage. I wish if I can returned. Don't  waste your money.,1483574400,,106,4.0
8644707,5,B00IR4U010,"Not sure about the review that noted ""city"" scene - there's no city on this DVD.  Only spectacular ocean, forest and floral scenery that absorbs you into the world of nature.  I wish there were many others like this.  I think I'd give up TV all together if I could find this type of DVD on a regular basis.  Music is not overwhelming - just blends in.  Very relaxing and soothing, and highly recommended.  We bought several copies and gave them away as Christmas gifts - very well received!!",1483056000,,491,4.46067415730337

8644709,5,B00IR4U010,I could listen to this meditation a thousand times. Stunning photography by Schwartzberg and words by Brother David Stendal Rast. It's all about gratitude.,1456876800,,155,5.5
8644710,2,B00IR4U010,"Only 19 minutes long.  Netflix stream has a Moving Art: Flowers by same artist and it's 30 minutes of beautiful flowers and beautiful music.  This DVD has 3 scenes, starting with city-life, and poor music as compared to the original that I've mentioned above.  Original is a pure 5 stars.  This one is a weak 2 stars.  Only reason it's not a 1 star is because it does have some pretty ""moving art""",1452124800,3,397,4.383561643835616
8644711,4,B00IR4U010,"Beautiful images!  I was less interested in the cityscapes though, which is why I rated it 4 stars. I wish that the video was longer and that there was a version with just flowers.",1441584000,,180,4.294117647058823
