Along with Guth's new insight about light.  All engineers and physists should read this!
thanks",1347580800,2,154,4.923076923076923
172290,5,0949906980,"This is a GREAT video! I read the book, which was a little heavy in some advance mathmatics, so I thought I would watch the video and am glad I did! I have studied the big bang theory and the Genesis 1 creation model and still struggled with this issue. As I looked at the different big bang models there were just too many assumptions that had to be made in each model to make it work, assumptions that were based upon no evidence whatsoever (such as Dark Matter, Dark Energy, etc.) and felt it was just calling upon the tooth fairy too many times. I found Starlight, Time and the New Physics scientifically satisfied the question of the time it takes light to travel from distant galaxies. What was really satisfying was when I went through this video and Genesis 1 together (along with Psalm 42) I found that this explaination fit perfectly and it was already in the Bible I just hadn't looked at it closely enough in the past. Carmeli's 5D Therom takes Einstiens General and Special Theories of Relativity to their natural conclusion. Highly recommend this video especially for those who have been honest with themselves about the short comings of the various Big Bang models, this will solve those questions.",1341360000,13,1213,4.6465116279069765
172291,4,0949906980,"While it probably won't satisfy the ardent skeptic or evolutionist, Australian physicist John Harnett does give a reasoned proposal to explain the existence of starlight over vast distances of time and space, thus giving more assurance for the Creationist viewpoint. He gives some physical equations and outlines the principles for the layman. Starting from Newtonian physics, he lays out the issue astronomers had in the past with equations on the planetary scale. Planets moved around the sun in a way that seemed to indicate more mass than could be observed within their orbits. The ""missing"" mass resulted in the untenable solution of ""dark matter"" which is unobservable. General relativity and the curvature of space resolved the equations without the extra matter.

  On the galactic scale, dark matter was invoked again to explain the observed increasing velocity of the outer edges of distant galaxies. Cosmological Special Relativity, advanced by Israeli Physicist Moshe Carmeli, accounts for this by adding the fifth dimension of velocity (characterized by the observed ""red shift"") into the equations. Experimental data indicates a fit of the observed galactic motions with the equations. Edwin Hubble and modern deep space observations indicate that Earth is near the middle of the observable universe which is expanding away from us. Harnett points out that time would accelerate for objects as they came into existence and expanded away from the center. Near the center, time would be stable and seem slower than that for things moving out. The vast distances and light years of the cosmos may thus be accounted for in less time than is generally supposed.",1339632000,12,1670,5.29433962264151

7793575,5,0949906980,Delivered as expected.,1470355200,,22,6.666666666666667
7793576,3,0949906980,"Didn't really get to the heart of the explanation until the last 2 or 3 minutes of the video. In my opinion, had he started at that point instead of ending there, it would have been much more informative.",1467676800,,204,4.256410256410256
7793577,5,0949906980,"Cosmological theory.  Universe formation based on biblical premises rather than Big-Bang assumptions.

I enjoyed it.  Dr Hartnett is enjoyable to listen too.  There are free lectures of his available on YouTube also.  I have 1st year college physics so it was fairly easy to follow.  Like taking a layman lecture on modern physics, but with theory/presumptions you don't hear at secular university.

Dr Russell Humphreys is also a nice physicist to listen to on the subject,  with  some differing theories.",1450396800,,506,5.225

7793579,5,0949906980,"This is an interesting subject and Dr.  Hartnett does a very good job of getting the information to you in a way which is easy to understand. He gives you a lot to think about and much proof in making his point. He is on to something big and it is fun to see how easy it is to get an answer to several questions that man has been asking for a long time. To best understand this DVD you need to get the ""Startlight and Time"" DVD. It gives you a deeper understanding and that is very good.",1431820800,,487,3.919191919191919
7793580,5,0949906980,The book is excellent if you understand physics and have taken advance mathematics like calculus and diferencial equations. It show facts and you can see when speculation start.,1429833600,,177,5.357142857142857
7793581,5,0949906980,Dr. Hartnett does what most scientists and cosmologists do not.  He will stretch your understanding and sweep away the fudge factors that keep creeping into our theories and conjectures.  Think outside the box and come at origins from a different starting place.,1390953600,,262,5.214285714285714

7793583,5,0949906980,It is wonderful to find scientist who can look objectively at data without feeling the need to bow down to the dogma of evolution.,1371168000,4,130,4.458333333333333
