6351926,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"Typical dystopian tale that, in a bit of an unusual twist, takes place aboard a massive locomotive propelled by a perpetual motion generator.

Opens 17 years after an attempt by world governments and leading scientists to halt global warming. Utilizing a chemical that would cool the Earth's atmosphere - they sprayed the entire planet. But predictions were off by a far margin. Tragically, they turned our home into a frozen hell of subzero temperatures.

All life is extinct except those that made it to The Train.

Onboard, people have been segregated into typical castes - the rich and powerful hog down at the front of the trough, then everyone else scrambles for what remains. The farther back one goes - the worse it gets. The vilest, most putrid of ""crumbs"" are left for those in the caboose.

As young Curtis grows up - he can no longer remember the life that was. He only knows the wretched life that is - and he's going to stop that at all costs. That means an uprising. Lead the dregs of humanity against their oppressors and take down the elites with their private guards and luxurious suites in the forward compartments

Curtis knows that two previous revolts went nowhere and changed nothing because they didn't reach the key - the engine. This time they won't stop until the engine is theirs or their collective deaths gives them a final release from their frozen hell.

An unusual move for Chris Evans, a.k.a. Captain America.

Not a bad one per se. Already an actor known for his powerful masculine presence and solid delivery, this fascinating performance reveals that he has the thespian skill to project gravitas; the depth of horror and shame from having done the unspeakable in order to survive. His portrayal will definitely put him on the radar for better projects down the road.

However, as much as I enjoyed Evans' portrayal - and I really did - the film that houses that performance was only mediocre. Made more difficult given Director Bong Joon-ho's choice of engaging one of his countrymen to portray a key role in the film. The scenes with Song Kang-ho and the portable translator needed some refined editing in order for anything his junkie character says or does to carry any real dramatic weight.

Overall, despite the excellent performances by the entire cast and buoyed with good set design - the film itself was only middling. Predictable and prosaic for those who screened the truly horrific film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/B003IWRE3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road</a>' or has any background in science-fantasy.

Movie Notes:

- Minor Spoiler Alert. Was stunned to see Ed Harris in this film - had no idea he was even the production since the various movie posters and cast shots do not show him anywhere. Nice. I like those kinds of surprises.

- Having read stories like this for years - and one can trace their origins to at least the 1950s - this was, at least for me, a fairly routine plot. Reminded me of Van Lustbader's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sunset-Warrior/dp/0425044521/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sunset Warrior</a>"" Cycle and Paolo Eleuteri Serpieri's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Morbus-Gravis-Druuna/dp/2908406144/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Morbus Gravis, Druuna</a>"" series.",1400284800,2,3387,5.40607210626186
6351927,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"The story of an oppressed lower class rising up and revolting against their totalitarian overlords in a dystopian future is nothing new, but never before has it been done with as much visceral intensity, stunning acting, and thought-provoking themes as in Bong Joon-Ho's SNOWPIERCER. In the days after I viewed the film, I could NOT get it out of my head. Snowpiercer haunted my waking and sleeping hours with strange and searing images.  Forgetting it's few small flaws - the plot holes and spotty CGI - we are left with a visceral, original and brilliantly acted look at desperation, hubris, and the importance of government.

The film is lead by a brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chris-Evans/dp/B00JGMK6VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chris Evans</a>, playing Curtis: a man leading a desperate band of third-class passengers in a daring revolt against the ruling-class of the train. Chris Evans can only be described as an acting BEAST in this movie. He has an authority and gravitas about him, giving his stunning performance an edgy, haunted look that only comes when you have nothing to lose.  Supporting him are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tilda-Swinton/dp/B0014B8KSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tilda Swinton</a>, playing a despicable, supremely memorable villain, and a  supporting cast of Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, Song Kang-ho, and Ewen Bremner, all of whom steal their scenes and embody their roles with subtle humanity.

The world of Snowpiercer feels real and frighteningly prescient. While the scientific aspect of the film is rather preposterous, the political issues raised so many ethical and moral questions for me in the days to come that my brain was a haze of conflicting opinions. But enough of ethics: Snowpiercer is visually stunning and immersive. Joon-Ho fills his film with striking images: a yellow dress in a field of grey, chilling (pun intended) images of frozen cities, a snowflake forming in mid-air.

But apart from acting, I was most impressed with the film's action. This isn't the beautiful gun-play of John Woo, nor the explosion poetry of Michael Bay. This is brutal, ugly, chaotic, gritty brawling that kills villains and heroes alike, leaving us cringing, gasping, or watching mesmerized through our fingers. Snowpiercer tears down the myth of the superhero. Good men die, bad men live, pain is caused, and people fight with hammers and knives because they have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

I don't want to jump to conclusions, nor do I want to convince people of anything, but in my personal opinion as a fan of science fiction and action, SNOWPIERCER is one of the best films I've seen in a while. Real, riveting, and ruthless, Snowpiercer keeps you guessing and gripped with powerful acting and brutal action. If you are a fan of science fiction, action, or want to be stimulated and entertained by a mature film...then SNOWPIERCER is the film for you! 5/5

6351928,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"It was entertaining if you can overlook the obvious flaws and contradictions.
At least a half million miles of track over land, bridges, and frozen water that has not required any maintenance in 17 years?!?!
A train going nowhere yet for some reason is required to stay in motion.
A featured character who is shown at tail of train AND train engine yet while there it is claimed right in front of her that nobody has ever been from one end to the other?!?!
Mammal carcases hanging for food yet nowhere are there any land animals on train.
Prisoners placed in cryo yet they are short on humans for food.
People cutting off their own arms and legs yet without immediate medical attention and no pain medicine they coherently maintain competent conversation?!?!
A man among hundreds of people crowded in small space is able to make regular phone calls on a secret hidden phone that is right out in common area?!?!

It goes on and on and on, HOWEVER, most of the nonsense is not apparent until past halfway through movie so you do get most of the movie as non insulting entertainment.",1398643200,9,1080,4.595854922279793
6351929,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"If you're reading my review on Snowpiercer, chances are you don't need an introduction to who Bong Joon-ho is, but I will say that I've been a fan since The Host, which I thought was a blast. I was very excited to catch Snowpiercer, but news about a chopped American version was disheartening.

I believe I saw the international cut, and it definitely could have used a top notch editor. This is the story of a dystopian future, one in which a chemical was released into the atmosphere to battle global warming, but instead froze the planet. On this planet, a train runs on a track that takes exactly one year to traverse. For 17 years, the people aboard this train are the only people on Earth.

Chris Evans stars, and I thought he did a fantastic job, alongside Song Kang-ho, who was also great. All of the performances in this were top notch. Tilda Swinton is here as a cartoonish caricature, but remember...this was based on a graphic novel.

It starts slow, but builds steadily until a disappointingly anti-climactic ending. There are some fantastic scenes here - a night vision scene and a steam room/bath house scene stand out, and the set design is pretty great.

If I have one complaint about this movie (aside from the need for some tightening), it is that the CGI in this movie (namely for the outside world) is dreadful to the point where it looks like cut scenes for a Playstation 2 game. Just absolutely awful.

If you're a fan of sci-fi, Bong Joon-ho flicks, or dystopian movies, I'd see this.",1398124800,3,1508,4.591078066914498
6351930,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"There is an opening narration to set the stage. Scientist attempt to combat global warming with a chemical CW7. It backfires and creates a deep freeze killing almost everyone. Everyone except those on a special self sustaining train designed by Mr. Wilford (Ed Harris) who plays the metaphorical deity.

The train is set up as an Eco-system with people being ""preordained"" to their roles. The system only works with everyone in their place. The first 30 minutes of the film introduces the rear passengers, i.e. the bottom feeders of society who are discontent with where Wilford has ""preordained"" them to be. Curtis (Chris Evans) is a natural leader and plans a revolt, with the idea being to get to the front of the train. The next hour of the film is the path forward, followed by metaphorical speeches on the construction of society and how things could not work anyway else.

The microcosm of the train is intended to reflect our world with everyone having a position by grand design, but to say anything more might spoiler the film. Needless to say, the symbols, colors, food substances, etc. all work together very well.

Chris Evans in the role of our hero wouldn't have been my first choice. His character, like so many in this film, was rather bland. I felt Octavia Spencer was under utilized. This is what happens to much of science fiction which concentrates heavily on a symbolic plot, they forget characters and use cutouts. This is where director/screenplay writer Joon-ho Bong must step up and tweak the characters. All I can say is that it worked for Peter Jackson.

6351931,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Loosely based on a French graphic novel series Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob & Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi action movie helmed by Korean director Joon-ho Bong, known for his acclaimed work such as Memories of Murder (2003), The Host (2006) and Mother (2009).

In Snowpiercer (English-language debut of the director), the near future world (2031 AD) is thrown into an ice age because of a failed experiment to stop the global warming seventeen years before. As most humans perish, some are lucky to board the train Snowpiercer, a train with the Perpetual Motion Engine, which keeps moving around the frozen globe. The irony is that the train has become a new society, where the elites are living comfortably in the cars in the front while others are crammed into the cars in the rear.

But Curtis (Chris Evans), an inhabitant in the tail car thinks its time to stop this, and rises up against Prime Minister Mason (delightfully over-the-top Tilda Swinton), leading other passengers to the front cars. As Curtis forces get closer to the engine, however, he realizes that things are much more dangerous and complicated than he thought.

The films other players include Jamie Bell, Ewen Bremner, Ed Harris, Alison Pill, Octavia Spencer and Kang-ho Song.

Like in his underrated monster flick The Host, Joon-ho Bongs latest film is in fact a social and political allegory. While the emphasis is firmly on entertainment value, the director succeeds in creating a Brave New World-like dystopian society that is darkly fascinating. The impressive interior design of the train cars is also a plus.

Of course, you can enjoy Snowpiercer as action movie. There is one very unique shoot-out sequence that is possible only on this long train. You may also notice references to real-life events (one shoe-throwing incident in Iraq, or a dispute over Buddhist statue between Japan and Korea).

Special effects are a little disappointing, especially in the final act, but Snowpiercer is a solid and intelligent thriller that keeps you guessing.",1396656000,8,2086,5.1386430678466075

Also stars Jamie Bell, John Hurt and Ed Harris. Great production design, great story: a lifeboat mutiny on a perpetual motion train. Tilda Swinton plays Ayn Rand Between the privileged and the starving classes. Snowpiercer is thrilling, charming and ironic. It could be a great hit EXCEPT the film was made with a release deal with Weinstein. Then Harvey insisted that the U.S. release cut 25 minutes. This caused such a worldwide uproar that Harvey just cut it loose. So there may be no U.S. release at all for an excellent film.

6351946,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"As a long-time survivor of harsh Chicagan winters, I have often voiced my struggles with snow. Seeing that my friends were not able to provide me with an answer as to how I can combat my problems with shoveling, I decided to turn to films in hopes that I might find a solution to breaking out of the igloo that is my home. Friends, family, and even the internets highly recommended Snowpiercer. However, I was disappointed with this purchase. After sitting through the entirety of the film, there were no scenes in which I witnessed an exemplary Chris Evans piercing snow. In fact, I didn't see any snow at all, as almost the whole narrative took place indoors on a mere train with snow falling barely visible from the windows. Everyone knows that single-setting structure is successful in one film and one film only: Die Hard. But I digress. The fact of the matter is, what began as a promising answer to my problems soon transpired into an experience in which I would intermittently throw up my small, shivering, mittened hands at the screen and exclaim, ""Who let Captain America board the train!"" What I mean is, if Bruce Willis can save our Christmases, then who will be the one to save us from snow?",1514592000,,1204,4.604651162790698

6351950,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Whether or not they like it, at least most of the reviewers ""get"" what this film is about.

Modern conservatives will despise ""Snowpiercer"", seeing it as Liberal film makers' assault on all that America holds good and true. It sure is, and we can't have enough of such films. With Donald Trump and his gang of moral thugs in control -- and the real possibility that once Pence becomes President, the Constitution will be amended to pervert it -- it's important viewing. (Tom Hanks' recent remark that the ""self-correcting"" nature of the Constitution bodes well for the long-term good of this country, shows that he doesn't understand history or human nature.)

This being said I watched this movie on vidangel (which I love so much btw)

I don't know the history behind making this movie but it seems like it could have been a graphic novel perhaps? So many plot holes, awkward filming and *SPOILER ALERT* kind of what was the point?

I am not against political movies at all. I do vote against making a not great movie, with a good cast and making creating a terrible, hard to follow story line.

6351962,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"I skipped this while it was on Netflix for some reason. Maybe it was the way it was described in their synopsis I don't know. My brain must have seen warning signs.

The movie has a bad premise to begin with honestly. A train would probably be one of the worst solutions to their frozen world problem. I typically like to watch movies with no expectations before I see it and am more often than not satisfied with the result. This wasn't one of the pleasing ones unfortunately.

This movie started off pretty intriguing, ignoring the implausibility. They capture your emotions and turn you against the ""front enders"" within like 30 minutes. Then one door opens and the whole thing jumps down a weird rabbit hole and doesn't climb back out. Train cars full of brainwashed cult-like people desensitized to anything happening around them. The writer just gives up after 30 minutes pretty much.

Things I liked:
- The auto translator device (with a terrible speaker)
- The aquarium train car
- Rave car
- The randomness of the movie (they all whip out torches at some point, artist guy, raved out angry people, polar bear)
- I liked the acting for the most part, and visuals were pretty nice.

Things I disliked
- Lack of bathrooms
- Lack of normal people (whos kids were those??) in any of the train cars ahead of the back people. There were some normal looking people but like < 10. maybe normal went extinct??
- Lack of bedding for front enders (even the engine guy doesn't have a bed)
- Zombie suit guy (come on... he got stabbed multiple times and choked. and SHOT at one point even)
- Plot
- Lack of attack strategy after like the 2nd door.
- That polar bear is gonna eat those two survivors, if the world went to hell he is probably hungry.
- Ending
- lack of answers

They really could have made a great movie if they took it more serious from when the plot coagulates into its final direction. I'd give it a two star cause I liked they had the balls to violently revolt if necessary (minus lack of planning), and it was weakly entertaining and had cool sets... but I can't, cause it was really bad overall.

The cinematography is beautiful; it pans perfectly from left to right to keep the idea of it being on a train clear in our minds, and the camera work helps us focus on important details and track the motion beautifully. The directing is overall fantastic, and the acting absolutely blew my mind. Chris Evans's best work, in my humble opinion. Plus, the soundtrack and sound editing is absolutely gorgeous. The thriller level of the film is on par with Mad Max. And there are in fact explanations for some plot holes; for instance, they live in a bubble - nothing is quite certain, so for all we know, there ARE people outside maintaining the tracks, or perhaps the technology at this time has made it self sustaining, just like the inside of the train.

There are certainly other lessons in this brutal, visceral, stark sci-fi classic that feels like an old school Japanese samurai flick married with ultra-violent sensibilities.  At its nihilistic dystopian core you have a totalitarian ruling system aboard an impossibly long (and odd) train that is travelling the frozen wastelands of a formerly nuclear scorched earth.  The many serve the few, and the few are a buffer barrier between the one and everyone else.  Amidst this system of enslavement and servitude of the large impoverished slave-class is hero (remember lesson 1 though) Curtis (Chris Evans) who makes a push up through the dictatorial ranks and brutal military machine, taking train car after train car, with the help of a few loyal to his venture and a couple who aren't--the man who created the train and knows its deathtrap systems and his daughter, both who are addicted to a drug that is like coal for the train.

The violence in this movie is brutal, daunting, and certainly serves the purpose of making you route for the underdogs.  It also helps that the bad guys have a dismissive attitude and have British bad teeth.

His characters are vivid and their moments of anger, frustration, regret and discoveries, among many other emotions are amplified through visual techniques that surpass the usual fodder we see in most films and especially in the science fiction genre. He is specific in the shots and in the editing; sometimes a horrific moment seems to be projecting some disturbing humour. This humour may come from the perspective of a character who is themselves a ridiculous personality. That in itself is a brilliant idea; people can be ignorant fools, taking themselves serious in their ignorance. Also Ho Bongs visual creativity puts the audience in so many various scenarios in such a dynamic way that it is awe inspiring! So many unexpected plot developments happen when you least expect them and so many characters are sacrificed without foreshadow, he just drops the bomb on you and you're not prepared!

6352050,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"Lots of reviews here for ""Snowpiercer.""

All I can say is that this is one of the worst ideas for a science fiction movie I have ever seen, heard or read.

I bought the movie on pre-order then purchased the graphic novel upon which it is based. I realized then what a mistake that was. I couldn't even finish it.

There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. If you need to know what those things are just read the one star reviews here on Amazon. The whole movie is just one big 'plot hole.' No attempt was given at rational thought or realistic behavior of the individuals let alone the absolutely impossible logistics. I understand the whole 'suspend disbelief' thing when you go see a movie but this is just ridiculous. It's more like 'turn your brain off at the door.' I know I'm making this personal but you can't possibly have much going on upstairs if you can 'suspend disbelief' for more than a minute in this movie. Either that or you have to be very young...like under 10 to think for even a second that something like this could ever happen. I know it's just a story but was any thought at all given to plausibility? The only way this movie could have been salvaged would have been for it to all have been the dream of some drug induced individual.

If I sat here and listed everything wrong with this movie I'd be commenting on every minute of the movie. Right from the get go...just the premise... a world frozen over due to chemicals released...and nobody thought to go to an underground shelter? It's just sheer stupidity from the distance traveled per year(with the speed the train was going it should have circled the world many times per year not just once)...to the growing of food...to the raising of the animals...to the schooling of the kids..to the slums(why not just do away with them)..to the ridiculous battles in which people seem to endlessly come from nowhere. You have malnourished individuals who can't even move let alone fight turn into warriors with video game moves...you have a train bouncing off the rails and back on again...prissy school teachers who turn into assassins......oh never mind that's enough...and oh yeah...a few survivors who have never seen the light of day or gone to school are going to somehow restart civilization by themselves...yes I'm spoiling the end, but then again am I really?....you should get the picture by now.

There were parts in the film where I was clearly supposed to sympathize with the characters, but I just didn't care. The movie spent no time establishing the characters so that I COULD sympathize with them. In fact, one of the dramatic twists at the end would have made my viewing experience better if it was at the beginning! The personalities of the people at the front felt too evil, Curtis' response at what the protein bars were made of was way too much of a freak-out, and honestly the train would have already faced avalanches and ice on the track already.
So, in short:
Rife with plot holes, entirely misses characterization, the choreography of action scenes just made me want them to be over, and the creator clearly doesn't know how to do worldbuilding.

SPOILER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY THE MOVIE BETTER: Okay, you ready? This makes the back of the train's motivations far more sensible, but they wait until the end to say it. Alright?

Films can be subtle about the statements they make. SnowPiercer by Joon Ho Bong is not one of those films. There is a clear position it has on climate change and the distribution of power. The film is based on a world where the government attempted to beat global warming by spraying chemicals in the air. This causes the earth to go into an ice age. The planet is dead except for anyone who made it onto the train. The train is a system of balance. Everything has to be in its place for it to run sustainable. Within the train, there is a huge gap for the distribution of power. The engineer is a deity because he is the one who created this new world and train. Then there are the fortunate people who live in luxury. Finally, there are the people at the back of the train who live like cockroaches. The people at the back of the train have no say in what happens. They get tortured and killed when they are seen to be out of line. In the world of the film, it seems as though giving one entity too much power ends with people suffering. The first time, the people let the government do whatever they wanted and it ended with the ice age. The second time, a man creates a train that unfairly incubates slavery and manipulation. The film does not want the audience to but all its faith in government or religion. It believes that the distribution of power and wealth needs to be more evenly distributed so that society can work as a team. When the characters work as a team they succeed, and when the engineer tries to maintain the power in one location, he fails. What could have been a simple dystopian film, has been turned into a public service announcement that begs the audience to take action to serve the betterment of society. SnowPiercer is a battle cry for the people to take charge of their lives to see the changes it deserves.",1461715200,,1850,4.3497109826589595
6352063,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"SNOWPIERCER SPOILERS AHEAD (and other films possibly)

  The post-apocalyptic thriller  especially weather related  has quickly become its own sub-genre in the high concept universe of science fiction. South Korean director Bong Joon-hos collaborative Snowpiercer is a clear standout as east meets west for this dark cinematic triumph. After the governments of the world came together to throw a Hail Mary pass at combating global warming, a swift and relentless ice age ensued and wiped out virtually all sustainable life on Earth.
  Set eighteen years later, humanitys last hopes are left trapped on the Rattling Ark  a perpetual motion train speeding along on a track circumnavigating the now frozen planet. The train has split into classes. Those in the front cars live in luxury provided by their revered leader, Wilford while the tailers have been forced into squalor and subjugation by the same man. Joon-ho subtly incorporates allusions to sci-fi movies of old. The big reveal of what the tail sections protein blocks are really made of may not be as grotesque as, but certainly hints at Soylent Green.
  Hong Kyung-pyos cinematography along with the extreme detail within each train car beautifully conveys the bleak and confining environment. Although each car the tailers move forward into looks better than the last, the audience gets the feeling that something is not quite right in this tragic display of what happens to humanity when it is trapped in a small space.
  The driving force behind Snowpiercer is the tremendous work from its cast. Ed Harris delivers a terrifically disingenuous performance reminiscent of his work on The Truman Show as the trains mysterious conductor, Wilford. Chris Evans shows us that his ability stretches far beyond the alpha male archetype in many of his previous castings. He brings to the table a deeply emotional and somewhat vulnerable performance as the tailers reluctant leader, Curtis that leaves you wondering how much of a hero he really is. Tilda Swinton is outrageous and hysterical from her lines to her costume as she embodies the ultimate political parody in Deputy Minister Mason.
  The cast of tailers shrinks as they make their video game-like journey from car to car. Marco Beltramis simple, yet heart-pounding and tense score builds tension while were given repeated close-up looks into the unwavering determination that rests in the tail section characters eyes. One of the final scenes, as Evanss character contemplates taking Wilford up on his Willy Wonka-like offer, Beltramis brooding score and Joon-hos mise-en-scene invokes the last temptation of Christ before Curtis is reminded of where he comes from and how the front section truly sees the tail section.
  As the humans destroy their protection from the lifeless world outside, the endings logic is similar to that of Cabin in the Woods (i.e. if this is what it takes to keep the status quo going, maybe its not worth preserving). The film may leave you with a lot more questions than answers, but plot holes and The Hunger Games parallels be damned! Suspend your disbelief and do not miss this thought-provoking and immensely entertaining allegorical take on modern society and the human condition.",1461542400,,3228,5.178846153846154
6352064,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Joon Ho Bongs Snowpiercer, is a thrilling and exciting dystopian thriller that is both enticing visually but also through its interesting story. The plot is simple, the year is 2031 and the world has frozen over due to governments attempt at controlling global warming. The last humans alive are aboard the Snowpiercer, an almost self-sustaining train that travels around the around in one year time. At the end of the train is where the poor, lower class civilians live and they start a riot in order to overthrow the rich that control their lives.
The plot is not new. There have been plenty of end of the world films throughout film history. What makes Bongs film stand out is the brilliant storytelling through character dialogue and its setting. Nearly the whole film takes place on the train, which carries the last surviving humans. The main character Curtis leads an uprising against the rich on the train. The beginning of the riot is one of the most thrilling and suspenseful moments I have experienced in cinema. Many scenes are very suspenseful and keep viewers on the edge of their seats, all taking place in the claustrophobic train cars.
As the group moves from train car to train car, there is a huge disparity between the back section and the front section of the cars. The group leaves the dark, industrial looking end cars and enters a world of color and beauty with the cold, white, outside world visible through windows. The set design is one of the strongest characteristics of this film. Not only are viewers given a rainbow of sets, it helps tell the story of the lives of the train inhabitants. Overall, this film is both thrilling and also visually pleasing.",1461542400,,1684,4.77054794520548
6352065,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"**WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!!**

The whole movie involves this ""sacred"" train that protects anyone inside of it from the freezing tundra that is the outside world.  The passengers are not all on the same team though.  The train is symbolizing a hierarchy pyramid, with the tail end of the train being the ""lower class"" (the survivors) and the front end being the ""upper class"" (the ones who run the train).  As you progress higher in the train (to the front end), just by looking at the passengers' costumes, hair and make-up helps you establish the higher class, which is the front end.

""I'm not who he thinks I am,"" says Curtis.  Between certain characters, as an audience member, you really start to question who they are.  Friend or foe?  Gilliam, someone who we first notice as a tail end passenger, is apparently working with Wilford, who is seen as the enemy living in the front end.  Eventually, Wilford goes and commands for Gilliam to be killed because of the rebellion of the tail enders.  What is Gilliam and what is Wilford?  With Curtis, you will wonder if he is a true leader or one who turns away from his people.  You decide in the end what Curtis really is.

The sound in ""Snowpiercer"" really helps create tension when it comes to the battles between the tail end and the front end.  When they fight, the underscore and sound effects are intense as you hear the sounds of metal scraping and clanking against metal over a very dark and slow underscore.  It has a very ""snow"" piercing sound to it making you feel scared for the tail end as they stand up to the front end, who are the ones holding the metal axes.  Some fights were also in slow motion making them even more intense, horrifying, and action-packed.",1461456000,,1730,4.586319218241043
6352066,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer: How the Rattling Ark will rattle your mind

*CONTAINS SPOILERS*

 Joon Ho Bongs 2013 film Snowpiercer transports the audience to the year 2031, where global warming has severely impacted the world  freezing everything over. Cigarettes are extinct, social classes are not. The Rattling Ark contains the surviving members of humanity, and the audience follows the character Curtis throughout his mission to make it from the back of the train to the front. Sounds pretty simple, right? Not when Curtis belongs to the bottom of the social pyramid and they plan a rebellion to get to the front to take over the train.
 There are many things that can be said about this film  lets start with some of the camera work. While much of the time the camera work seems pretty similar to action movies today, aka fast paced and cutting every other second, we see a couple really cool things happening. One, in all the scenes in which the different social classes are fighting the camera is shaking and off balance. It gives the audience a sense of distortion and dizziness  which we can imagine that is what it would feel like fighting on a train. There is also a scene in which Curtis is in the midst of a shootout with one of the top military men on the Rattling Ark, but they are shooting at each other from different cars as the train loops around. The camera works to cut between the two characters in their respecting cars, close ups of the bullets slowly breaking the glass, and the outside of the train as it chugs on and loops around. The anticipation in this scene is brutal between the cuts.
 Not only is the camera work interesting, but the plot itself is mind blowing. In the beginning of this film the audience is very unaware of what is going on. We start off confused and we are forced into supporting the tail end in their rebellion  even though we have no background information and no idea what is going on. As Curtis and some of the tail end members make their way to the front we begin to learn more and more about what is going on, and what has been going on for years. As more and more members of the tail end are killed Curtis continues to push his way to the front, and when he gets there all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. The rebellion was a setup and Curtis is meant to control the train. Here is where the twist comes in, Curtis no longer wants control of the train because he has seen how messed up humanity has become whilst turning this train into the world. In the end we are left satisfied, but also disappointing. Mixed emotions on many levels.
 Should you watch this? Yes. Why? Because not many films today have the ability to be so enthralling while getting to the theme of how messed up social classes and humanity can become  especially after we destroy the earth. I could be wrong, but watch it yourself and see what you think.",1461456000,,2877,4.460952380952381

6352094,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"I'd vote this movie as the best adaptation from comics movie ever!

I'll make a review on the bonus disc. As for the movie, I believe others have reviewed better.

There are many bonus features on the 2nd disc. From pictures, sketches, story boards, interviews with actors, etc. I was very impressed with behind the scenes. We can see how the stage was built. We can also see the comic book adaptation process, incl interview with comic artist Jean-Marc Rochette. Rochette even got involved in the movie, as the illustrator. His works were used by the actor who played as an illustrator in the movie. I also love the place where Rochette was interviewed. it was the library of Angouleme Comics Museum, France. In case you don't know, Angouleme is the most prestigious comic festival in Europe.

We also get some parts on Jacques Lob, the visionary and writer of the comic book. Unfortunately he passed away many years ago.

Another footage was the premiere screening in South Korea. I love seeing the enthusiast audience, and they love meeting Rochette. Asking for autographs, pictures, etc. Something that Rochette told us, not usually happened in France. I can see how Korean people admired and respected the movie and also the book. There was even a scene when Rochette was having a cup of coffee in a shop, while waiting for his driver. The coffee lady, around 50's I think, asked for Rochette's autograph. She said she has seen the movie and very liked it.

Other footage was interview with Bong Joon Ho, the director. Honestly, I'm not impressed on the questions the host gave. It should be better than that, and it was very common.

The world is frozen and the only survivors [that we know of] are on this train. OK... and they have been circling the world since it froze, good deal I'm down with that. And in the time since the deep freeze, the passengers on the train have formed their own little mini version of humanity, where  the haves do everything in their power to keep the 'have nots' in  place. Such as lie, cheat, steal - oh wait, that's very much like today and welcome to the movie. I will say it's not easy to watch, yes, there is a lot [A LOT] of surface action but the best is going on beneath the surface - oh, did I mention there seems to be an expectation that *you* will do some of the work of the movie because it will challenge you. What is ""right""? Does it change depending on where you are on the train? Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?
Is this a perfect movie? Aw, c'mon, you know it's got some flaws, some one dimensional characters, but it never fails to engage you and you will cheer [or maybe just pump your fist] for the hero.
Tilda Swinton is excellent. Chris Evans is better than you would think, Ed Harris, John Hurt deliver professional performances.

So without cohesion I lost interest in the movie and finished it with the intent of seeing just how bad of a movie it would become.

6352133,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"This is very unusual sci-fi thriller with quite impressive cast.  It is a story of what happens on earth after catastrophic climate change.  Most of the population is dead due to extremely cold weather and the ones that were lucky to survive are on the long train running in perpetual circles around the earth.  The new society is doing their best to be self sufficient.  But there is a social order to it too.  In the back of the train is the lowest ""caste"" of the human race and as one is moving towards the front of the train the ""standard"" of living continues to increase.  there are botanic gardens, aquariums, tailors and even dentists available.  Children lucky to be born closer to the head of the train are receiving normal education and are also being indoctrinated in the cult of their leader - an evil scientist who created the train that saved so many lives, but with it brought a whole new dimension to human suffering.

So as it happens with any repressed society there is a mutiny on the train, or shall we call it a revolution lead buy charismatic young man who spent almost 18 years living in the back of the train.  He knows so much about how it is to live with regret of actions that can never be taken back.  But will this make him change sides for the promise of  becoming a new leader to the people who need to be subjected to the stick social order, so they can survive?

Tilda Swinton is one of the characters in this movie and she is almost unrecognizable.  Her talent as an actress and pretty amazing makeup make her character in this move one of the most repulsive creatures I have recently seen on the big screen.

6352147,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"A brilliant movie.  Ingenious actually.  You have the outward appearance of a class struggle among a post apocalyptic world, but really the struggle is inside the train/or the human energy system.  The first hint I had of the spiritual metaphor of the train was the long view of the train slithering like a snake, and the description of it as head to tail, when referring to the cars of the train.  The train is the body, and the energy is the snake like kundalini energy trying to make its way up the body of the train.  In the beginning, there is the lie, ""There is no life outside the train,"" which in fact is the lie we have to over come, is there life outside the body?  If the characters cannot escape the train, then all they can do is go up the spine of the train, like the kundalini goes up the spine of the human.  EAch way station achieved represents the next chakra.  Every character represents something important, every line in the movie is important when you look at the movie this way, it all works and all fits with spiritual reference if you stop and work it out.  For instance, Tilda Swinton represents the ego.  A woman being called a man who tries to convince everyone that she is aligned with the head of the train. ( Stop here if you don't want to get info in later scenes) She is captured and taken under control at the 3rd chakra, and yes, at this stage, a spiritual adept would start to yoke the ego under his control, but it is at the heart chakra, the ego is destroyed, because at this point of a spiritual journey, the adept would have overcome the ego, and no longer need it.  If one knows the chakra lingo, and the way the kundalini works one can see the parallels to this movie, and how the characters can use the 'drug' to escape through the hatch(pineal gland) like a shaman would use a drug to have a vision.  But as the body dies, much like the train is destroyed, the pineal is the only escape.  In the end when the girl sees the bear, who is often depicted as a spiritual guide in many cultures, we are to know that she will be okay.  ONce I saw the movie this way, I appreciated it so much more.  I loved every line, every metaphor.  If you like yoga and psy-fi, and you can stomach  violence, then you'll love this movie.",1442534400,,2261,4.257611241217798

However, I did find the political message amusing given that it unintentionally reveals the truth about those that claim to want to save us from so-called global warming. Given their way, society WILL be starkly divided between the haves and have-nots. Just listen to what they say. The little people are going to have to make sacrifices to save the planet, such as giving up our AC, SUVs, beef (former United Nations General Secretary Kofi Annan has even stated he wants us to eat bugs in order to fight global warming), and then the ultimate sacrifice  death (death with dignity, abortion, eugenics, and the like in their efforts at population control). Yet these same never seem to give up their private planes, massive homes, nor any other comfort of their own, after all it is a socialist/communist idea that everyone's station in life is determined by government.

Why is this amusing? Because liberal critics are praising this movie as showing whats wrong with the country, and don't even realize they are looking into a mirror.",1440720000,,1265,4.874418604651162

6352171,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Honestly, I thought Snowpiercer was a REALLY good science fiction suspense.  It's about a group of people who are forced to live on a supertrain due to an ice age occurring outside.  I don't think they mention what prompted the ice age.  At first a group of authority figures try and control the innocent people in the back, but because they're scumbags that like to cause all kinds of needless trouble and violence, eventually the innocent people find the courage to fight back.

Some of this was pretty strange writing.  I mean why did the one security guard insist on wanting to know if anyone knew how to play the violin?  An ice age occurring outside while the train circles snowy mountains, everyone's stuck on a train and... they need a violin player?  And when an old man and his wife approach the guard and say they know how to play, why did the one guard smack the woman with his gun?  Strange stuff!  Also the way the guards torture one man who disobeyed by making him stick his arm outside in the frozen elements for several minutes was bizarre too.

Well it turns out this supertrain has many different rooms that lead to all kinds of visually amazing sights.  When the people are finally free after a brutal bloody fighting scene involving hatchets and other weapons, they kidnap the leader of the authority (Tilda Swinton's character) and she's about as weird as a person can be, haha.  A lot of times her English isn't very clear either and sounds muffled.  She reminds me of that flaky woman in the beginning of the Hunger Games who stood around announcing the participants in the battle.  Speaking of which, this movie has a similar vibe to the Hunger Games.  A theatrical type of look that initially gives one the impression that it's going for a playful them until it suddenly turns extremely violent.

Anyway after the people are freed, they visit places like an aquarium with the most spectacular fish you've ever seen swimming around inside the walls and ceilings, an orange grove flourishing with life and elegance, a steamy sauna, a party for costume lovers, the cozy engine room, etc.  A little too strange for my understanding!

Chris Evans is basically the star of the movie.  He's the guy who originally came up with a plan to take over authority with his friends.  Once they go through with it, the suspense is on!  Get ready for some heavy violence after 20-25 minutes.  Song Kang-Ho is another memorable character.  At first he hates everyone, security guards and the innocent people alike, but it turns out he has his own game plan pertaining to an escape route.  His daughter Go Ah-Sung learns how to deal with the constant death that surrounds her by wising up and learning to fight back.  Octavia Spencer is simply looking for her son which is a minor plotline for most of the film.  Alison Pill plays a flaky school teacher who gives the false impression she cares about her students, but she actually packs heavy machine gun power!  Take no crap Emma Levie.  And finally Ed Harris is the one who has the perfect life in his precious little engine room.  Lots of great characters overall.

This movie isn't for everyone's taste. It sort of has a Johnny Depp feel to it, but he never appears.  Sure felt like he would make a surprise appearance though.  The emphasis is on treating kids like animals to keep the engine's running.  That sure makes Chris Evans angry!  The suspense is high, the acting is good, perhaps the writing could have been less hokey and the presentation could've looked less play-like, but otherwise terrific movie overall.",1439510400,,3582,4.6784

6352173,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"I enjoyed this movie because it is a flashy rendering of the futility of ones attempt to transcend the quasi-Spartan existence of a movie consumer and attaining the luxurious lifestyle of a movie maker. On the whole Snowpiercer is good for provoking thoughts about what people would do with themselves if they didn't envy people who live the lives of pop icons, but there are some major beliefs that you must first suspend in order to enjoy this movie.
First of all, you cannot question why the train has to go running around the world on an ice-covered track at high speed. There are repeated references to the train being the world, and perhaps the viewer is supposed to make some sort of correlation between the earth whipping through space and the train zipping along the track, but the difference is that space isn't covered with fresh air, snowcapped mountains and more natural resources than the remainder of humanity can ever hope to use up. Nonetheless the metaphor of the train-as-earth does hold on several philosophical levels, they simply should never be considered in reference to this movie.
Next, the entire field of economics has ceased to exist. Transportation requires maintenance; and since rich people don't do maintenance the whole premise of the movie is blown. If economics existed in Snowpiercer the movie would have been a very short treatise on libertarianism followed by the train coming to a halt until communism was adopted, which would only work until the people who knew how to fix the train realized that they should get paid more than the people who clean the train, followed by the movie going back to where it started out, only with a far more robust discussion of labor unions. Instead, Snowpiercer has a blind spot for economics that only spoiled dependents can ignore.
Penultimately, the viewer cannot ask the question Why did the engineer let the poor people on in the first place if everyone despised them so much? There is an intriguing dialogue near the end of Snowpiercer between the engineer and the hero which revisits the whole train-as-earth metaphor, only the engineer suggests that humanity is not complete without poor people. While this will certainly appeal to those who did not miss the (absent) economics of the film, the entire premise of the movie is that nobody changes social classes, so in fact you could have nothing but rich people on board and the train would magically keep on running. This brings us to the final belief that must be suspended, which is that the genius engineer requires a ginormous stock of poor people so that they can breed two (yes, two) less-than-five-year-olds, on which the train relies in order to keep running. If you are thinking that the whole idea of a magic train might seem just a bit more believable if it was powered by the engineers sacrifice of living children to some unseen god in the engine or something, you're not alone . . . in your disappointment! Apparently the genius engineer who can build a supertrain that runs forever without maintenance and contains an entire self-sustaining ecosystem capable of providing the highest level of human indulgence known to man will come to a screeching halt if there are not two small children under the age of five available to squeeze into some part of the miracle engine and push some buttons. Seriously, I wish I was making this up.
Nonetheless I gave Snowpiercer four stars because it is thought provoking. Why would I give such a high rating to a movie with so many holes in the plot? Because it is a glimpse into the minds of the ruling class. Whether they admit it or not, people who make movies are the upper class. They take our money in return for our sitting on our asses for two hours doing nothing, just like the people in the back of the train. Snowpiercer may not be an accurate look at humanity, but it is an interesting look into the minds of those who are so privileged that they can afford to be completely ignorant about economics.",1439164800,,3996,4.751079136690647

6352180,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"Spoiler Alert:
Who is the hero here? Chris Evans? Not by a long shot. When I first streamed this movie last night, it was listed under ""Sci-fi"" and ""Action Adventure."" Those are my two favorite types of movies. This movie had action/adventure, and was set into the future, but beyond that, it lacked soul. When I watch these types of movies, I have to have someone to root for, someone I care about as a character that has redeemable qualities. Evans' character lacked any. Not even one. Often, directors and set designers will use color to contrast the ""good"" versus the ""bad."" Good characters often have a sense of community, often wear earth tones, and have somehow turned a bad situation into something that they can find humor in. This movie starts off with grey/black/white as its color scheme, and never strays far from it. There is no sense of community in the downtrodden. They have no humor. They have no hope. As the back of the train folks revolt, and make their way up to the front of the train, only the scenery and clothing change...but the characters are really all the same. They are all creatures who have their entire futures mapped out, as they are in a ""contained ecosystem"" and that system must maintain balance in order to survive. When Evans' character finally reaches the front of the train, it looks an awful like the back of the train, except with better food and more space.
The director made a key error in this film: not making any character likable. Ones that had potential were sacrificed early or pushed to the side so the focus could be on Evans and Swinton. And you know you have failed as a director when Swinton has a more likable character than Evans. Even when few escape the train to the outdoors, the scenery remains the same: grey/black/white, and lacking any hope. Avoid this one.",1438387200,4,1823,4.62962962962963

But this movie was too ridiculous to ""suspend disbelief"" and follow the story.

How did these people survive ? ? ?
What did these people do all day ? ? ?

Where did they get supplies for everyone, such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, medicines, toilet paper, diapers, sanitary products, tampons, toothbrushes, hairbrushes, nail-clippers, scissors, utensils, clothes, underwear, towels, etc. etc.

The amputations were just ridiculous.
If a person's arm is cut off, they would die from the shock of it, they would keep screaming until their heart stopped.
Or, they would bleed to death -- there were no surgeons with sterile supplies to cut the arm through the bone and then sew it all up.
Or, they would die from infection -- there were no medications such as antibiotics or painkillers.
And, after miraculously surviving losing an arm, then they lose a leg also.
What about post-traumatic stress?
Where did they get those prosthetics -- those fake hook arms?
Remember, 17 years passed, so even if they once had any proper sterile supplies, they would have run out, and even if they had any medications, they would have expired, etc. etc.

And the part where they were walking through a car with chickens hanging from the ceiling ! ! !
Where did those chickens come from?
All animals were extinct 17 years ago.
They couldn't have been raising animals on the train.
This part was even too ridiculous to discuss.

Every single scene was full of plot holes which were too ridiculous to discuss.

Also, this movie was boring, too long and dragged out, very violent and dark, and just in every way horrible.

And the ending.....
Everyone dies, except for one woman and one small little boy.
We are supposed to believe that a grown woman and a little boy can survive out there, and then somehow populate the earth together?

John Hurt and Chris Evans are two of these denizens, and Evans spearheads an attempt to lead the others forward, battling their way to the front of the train where the engineer and man who created and is in control of the train, a man named Wilford, portrayed by Ed Harris, resides.  They must endure numerous pitched battles along the way, but pick up allies, and finally reach Harris.  I won't spoil the ending.  The film is very well directed and acted.  Chris Evans gives an excellent performance, as does Hurt.  Toward the end it gets a little talky and hokey, and Ed Harris seems miscast as Wilford.

The plot of the film is that global warming has forced the government to release Ice 9 into the atmosphere, freezing the entire planet and killing all life.  The survivors of the human race are now on a train circling the planet where the rich are in the front and the poor are in the back.  The poor revolt, and as they move their way up the train, more and more is revealed about this new world..

The film is both science fiction AND metaphorical/allegorical, and so you have two different audiences watching it.  From my semi-serious perspective, the Metaphor People are viewing it from the front of the train and us Science Fiction People are viewing it from the back..

Yeah, so as science fiction I'd give it 3 1/2 stars due to plot holes-- a few of which are unexplainable.  BTW, here's a possible explanation of why the train had to move:  the ice is broken up and used as water, and the water could be broken down into O2 for breathing (no plant life means no photosynthesis) and H2 for fuel, and perhaps some sort of regenerative braking for charging batteries as well... But there's other things that cannot be explained.  Overall, I think it's passable science fiction, though..

But as a metaphor, I didn't care for it.
Actually, the reason I think it failed as metaphor for me was that it was about classism and judging by some of the 5 star reviews, the people who really loved it sound like they're the critics, metrosexuals, hipsters, and wine guzzling libertines on the front of the bus (figuratively speaking) that the
film was mocking.  So to create a film about classism and at the same time have it appeal to all the elitists out there... BTW, don't the people who pay hundreds of dollars, and wear thousand dollar outfits to their outings as they watch broadways plays and musicals about the poor and wretched.. do those people have any sense of self-awareness?

Set in 2031, the entire world is frozen and dead after a failed climate-change experiment except for those aboard the Snowpiercer. For 17 years, the world's survivors are on a train hurtling around the globe creating their own economy and class system. Led by Curtis, a group of lower-class citizens living in squalor at the back of the train are determined to get to the front of the train and spread the wealth around. Each section of the train holds new surprises for the group who have to battle their way through.

This is indeed a very original and visually awesome looking sci-fi, certainly as others have said this is probably one of the best films you have never seen or heard of, an interesting and completely bonkers idea for a story, the movie is rather a good budget with fantastic effects and stunning scenery and set designs, each section of the train is strange and bizarre in many different ways, the cast all round is brilliant, Chris Evans is a good lead, we also have John Hurt and Ed Harris, many known faces, Tilda Swinton deserves much credit in this as she is rather creepy and yet very entertaining, the director of this movie is Joon-ho Bong, a Korean director who made the cool monster movie The Host back in 2006, I think this is an amazing English language movie that still has the feel of his previous movies, the movie for most part is entirely in English apart from the part of Korean actor Kang-ho Song (also from The Host 2006) if you love original sci-fi with a great visual style then look no further than to check out this little unknown gem, it may have a few plot holes here and there that you could possibly pick at but don't, its an amazing piece of cinema!!

As a forewarning this movie is graphic, violent, and has many scenes that may force you to look away if you tend to be squeamish. I attempted to avoid spoilers but it did not work well so proceed with caution.

The plot of the movie is best left simply explained, as the twists and reveals are what give Snowpiercer its constant barrage of emotional gut-punches. The extremely diminished population of Earth is living onboard a train in constant motion. The world outside of the train is a barren and frozen tundra caused by scientists attempting to avert global warming, succeeding but throwing the process in reverse, causing a new Ice Age. On the train the people are segregated by class with the malnourished commoners in the back and the rich elite occupying the front. The train and plan to save humanity was all orchestrated by a visionary named Wilford, but getting into any more than his name takes away a central mystery to the movie. The desolate in the back of the train are led by the strategic Curtis and his old decrepit mentor Gilliam. Forced to eat disgusting protein blocks and live in squalor, Curtis bides his time waiting to lead a revolution.

There is a grotesque torture scene near the beginning of the movie that perfectly encompasses the brutality of life on the train. Describing this movie as a blood bath does not do the fight choreographers justice. Once the action and plot get in motion it rarely slows down as Curtis accompanied by other characters rebel and crawl their way to the front of the train. Lots of characters die, children are constantly in danger, and you will see and hear taboo content that is rarely touched upon in other movies. Snowpiercer is an Indy film that was only screened in selective theaters, explaining how it gets away with a few of its more noteworthy scenes. All of the grizzly scenes would be excessive had they not been backed up by the fantastic acting that makes this world feel all too possible.

The movie touches on a multitude of complex sci-fi issues such as geoengineering, eugenics, and big brother controlling the masses. Class exploitation and self-sacrifice are a main focus and while the film expresses that mankind is responsible for its own downfall; Capitalism is also to blame for the predicament that the train goers find themselves in. Curtis has a choice to make at the end of the movie with no clear cut answer. Is it better to attempt to change and fix the oppressing society, or burn the whole thing to the ground and begin anew? The ending of the movie did not go where I expected it to, but the revelations in the end of the movie justify Curtis decision and emotional journey whether you agree with his decisions or not.

In the secondary reading I chose for Snowpiercer, A Snowpiercer Thinkpiece, Not to Be Taken Too Seriously, But For Very Serious Reasons by Aaron Bady, I agree with a lot of the points that he made. I mentioned Curtis choice already and Bady had the same thought if the world Is it worth sustaining? This is a question that the movie raises at several points, particularly when we learn why so many of the passengers lack arms and legs. I had been confused during one scene in the movie when the rich train-goers and partiers are seemingly happy to have the opportunity to tear the lower class citizens limb from limb, and Bady gives a good explanation on why that may be, Without occasional violence, there would be only pleasure, and pleasure fades when there is nothing but pleasure. At a certain point, you need blood; the revolution provides that blood, as does counter-revolutionary violence against the bare-life tail-section passengers. I had not thought about it myself , but Bady makes a great point when he says that, Snowpiercer is not about the revolution we might have today, then; its about the time after revolution has ceased to be possible. I believe that the previous quote is a much better way to describe this film after the revelation in the end.

Overall the action, world building, and emotional beats make this a must see film for any fan of sci-fi, cli-fi, and dystopian fiction in general.",1430438400,,4412,4.717250324254215

6352268,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"A different concept to an apocalypse movie, yes a bit strange, a different take. To imagine (SLIGHT SPOILERS) a rich tycoon with the means and for sight to create a mobile city (a super train) to circle the globe after governments decide to reduce global warming...they would fill the atmosphere with some chemical that (unknowingly) puts the earth into deep deep freeze.
The rich tycoon had a fore sight to say that the chemical would kill every thing on earth, no one believed him, so he build his super train ( cause he loved trains as a kid) as a home/city to a thousand or two or segregated by class people, the rich in the front, the poor in the rear, much of this information wasn't learned until about half way through the movie. and the low class people were treated much like prisoners.
Starting the movie, I had this feeling that I had sat down watching a movie half way through, it was very rushed from the beginning with many unanswered questions till the end. Chris E. character appears as a leader to most the poor rear car passengers, they get this notion they want to over run the train, the guards and people running it, take control of the engine car and the rich tycoon in charge. A simple enough plot that does get deeper toward the end of the movie. There are many loose ends though and unanswered questions in the framework of the story that will leave you scratching your head.
The rich Tycoon (Ed Harris) brilliantly played but....a bit un-natural given the circumstances, as well I would have thought his security would have been much higher near the engine car. Actions was good, acting was good, maybe a bit graphic on the violence for some people. The ending wasn't the best in my opinion...the last 25 minutes of the movie were dragging the build up, the movie could have been 15 minutes shorter without missing any important information & when it was over.....it was like, is that it ?
BOTTOM LINE: A better than average sci fi flick with great action, and a story line that is so weird that it will suck you in for pure curiosity if nothing else. If you have nothing else to watch on a Friday night, rent it, watch it, but don't buy it, I am a lover of Sci Fi, action and futuristic movies, I doubt I will ever watch this one again.

6352296,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"This was one heck of an odd movie.  Frankly, it annoyed me most of time time.  The whole social commentary things was a bit much.  Oh, and if you are too dense to figure it out, Wilford has a little speech at the end that basically lays it all out there for you.

The whole idea of the non-stop train struck me as dumb on its face.  However, I'll let that pass.  That's the world that was created for the film, so fine.  However, it is the other inconsistencies that make this a pretty ridiculous effort.

The big one for me is the fate of the main character... I think his name was Curtis.  Was it Curtis?  Bah... doesn't matter... I'm going to call him Curtis regardless.  So when Curtis finds his way to the engine, Wilford tells him that it is his destiny to take his place and run the train.  Ummm... ok, but then why were they trying to kill the guy the entire time he was trying to get there?  Wilford even tells Curtis that the revolt was supposed to have ended in the car when the lights went out.  That's when the scum from the back of the train were supposed to have been defeated.  Ohhh.... ok... Curtis was in that car.  So are you telling me that the grand plan was to have won and killed Curtis or was the grand plan to have Curtis replace Wilford?

Sorry - but if the train is a closed system and Curtis is the chosen successor, then why spend the whole movie trying to kill him?  Better yet, why not send someone to the back of the train to get him and bring him up front?  They do that all the time.

Also, the whole plot reminded me of the Matrix.  Chosen one escapes one place and gets into another place.  He is hunted there until makes it to the core... I mean the engine... and then the dude in charge tells him the whole thing was a big game to trim down the population.

The quirky sibling drug addicts played by the great and hilarious Song Kang-Ho and now grown up, beautiful Go Ah-sung are in top form. If you have yet to seen these fine Korean actors and director's previous work in The Host or The Good The Bad and The Weird then you are missing out.

So this is just another version of the unfair division of power, resources and privilege that always has and probably always will exist, with the futuristic story of how that might play out in an end-of-the-world scenario. That's a fine concept for a story, but I didn't enjoy the campy nature of the acting and portrayal of these allegorical societal levels. I'm not really into campiness.

I enjoyed Snowpiercer.  Quite a bit.  It hovered somewhere between Sci-Fi Channel (excuse me: SyFy Channel) and real-boy movie, which added to the charm, excusing a small handful of poor effects while allowing the story to be wilder than it might have otherwise been allowed to be had the budget been larger.  Sure, there are examples of ""mainstream"" movies I might hesitate to try and explain to someone, but you're not going to see Sharknado on the big screen - unfortunately - nine times out of ten.  I'll admit this is something I like about Science Fiction as a whole: being thought-provoking while also having a fair amount of slack where narrative is concerned.  Maybe as a fan I'm biased and have missed this effect in other genres, so I won't say as a blanket statement it's the best, just something I've noticed as one who's more keyed in here than I am, say, Rom Coms.

So the plot.  It's the future.  Humans have done something to the world either through a war-based Armageddon or climate change - I don't remember them out-right saying - where the earth is now a snow wasteland.  The only survivors are on a train, riding a line which circles the globe, pariah on the back end of the rails, upper-class near the front.  A revolution finally occurs, the lower caste having enough of the fear and the tough-hand of their supposed betters, and a group of fighters from the last cart make a push to reach the front.  The man who built the train is worshiped by the wealthy with a prophetic zeal.  I know the concept is not necessarily new, but there are a number of similarities to the Bioshock universe which, as a big fan of those, I was pleasantly surprised to see, knowing nothing of the story of Snow going in.  People familiar with Andrew Ryan (or even Comstock, though the setting felt more a Rapture than a Columbia) will feel right at home with Wilford and his train.

Each of the cars are a different world the closer you get toward the front: a garden, an aquarium, a set of nightclubs, and what appeared to be an upscale restaurant, each of these again echoing a city in the clouds or beneath the waves.  Even the dress of the citizens is exaggerated, at times plucked from a Victorian era, and others an Akira Neo Tokyo.  And Hunger Games.  Tilda Swinton's Mason reminds me of what Effie will look like in another thirty years.

The action is well directed.  I'm a big advocate for directors just putting the camera down and leaving it be when the fighting starts, but the combat is the right blend, a mix of frantic and pulled-back, allowing for hand-held within the kinetic frays of battle before taking a step away to show the audience the conflict at large.  I dug too the use of light in many places, both as an atmospheric tool and a means of differentiating classes as the revolutionaries progressed further into the train.  Performances are good.  Chris Evans feels mostly like he's playing a lesser boy-scout Captain America, which is fine, and he isn't bad in any way.  Just the same.  John Hurt is a quieter Professor Broom which is also fine.  More than fine because I like him.  Come to think of it, there isn't much negative to say about anyone.  While a handful of characters are over-the-top, you're also dealing with an apocalypse train and an army of dudes who look like executioners from a time when the Black Plague was still a thing, so those over-the-top aren't too out of place.  In an effort to further rationalize my tying of Snow to Bioshock, the executioners in their craze and fanaticism are decent substitutes for Splicers, though I prefer masquerade masks, if I'm choosing.

The world of Snowpiercer is an interesting one, and a universe I wouldn't mind spending more time in.  It doesn't have much need of a sequel, but if the material is as equally interesting and builds on some of the groundwork, I'd be in.  I'd be in anyhow, it's just my level of complaint which would fluctuate.  Recommended.  One of the better science fiction flicks I've seen in a while, and one of the better action flicks too.  Even thinking of giving it a re-watch soon.  Maybe when we get our first real big snow here.  Try and make the experience an interactive one.",1425859200,2,4269,4.659090909090909

The only way that the remaining humans survive is by all living on a constantly moving train. The train travels the entire world and its divided up by classes.
Before I move on I will say that a majority of the negative reviews are very vague about their complaints and some claim the film to be confusing which I think I can understand. The film shifts from, as one reviewer put it, ""reality"" to allegory. I think this is where the confusion comes from. Is it a negative that the film does this? No, not for me. And of course if you tend to have a more fiscally conservative view you might not be a big fan of the films message. It is essentially a criticism of trickle down economics at the end of the day. It's not a film that you can just take what's given on the surface. We'll you can, I think, and still have a good time watching it. But if you dive into whats beneath the surface of the film I think you will get more out of it as a viewer.

6352334,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer is an inventive, dark and brutally violent movie that succeeds on many levels, including the emotional. You've no doubt read the synopsis elsewhere so I won't repeat it.  Whereas some reviewers have deducted style point for inaccuracies, plot contrivances and unbelievable set pieces and designs, I bought into the SCI-FI underpinnings and didn't require that a fantasy thriller make perfect sense.

The movie succeeds by being a post apocalypse morality play and an inventive take on the haves vs. the have-nots on the globe circling train.  Sure, the water in the hot tubs doesn't move, there are no sleeping quarters for the haves, and it's all one huge fantasy.  But the conflicting emotions of those in the rear of the train provide the essential gravitas on which the class struggle story is based.

The acting is somewhat limited by the grim environment and claustrophobia of the train. None of the leads (with the exception of Tilda Swinton in a remarkably scary and disturbing turn) are pushed to expand their repertoire.  It's the visuals and set design and VFX that really shine, from the train interiors to the frozen earth spectacle to the marvelously choreographed fight scenes which remind me of those in the Kill Bill series.

I was impressed with Snowpiercer, and deducted one star due to some lackluster acting and some gratuitous violence. Not for kids, but a very impressive achievement.",1425254400,4,1419,5.064377682403434

6352339,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"The first English language film directed by South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, ""Snowpiercer"", is a bizarre and screwy science-fiction dystopian action thriller about an atomic high speed train in 2031 that is continuously circling an Earth frozen solid to the point life on it cannot be sustained.

The only people left alive are those on this speeding train, and they comprise various social classes all controlled by a hidden leader named Wilford as if he were the Wizard of Oz. Tilda Swinton, in one of the greatest performances of 2014, plays Minister Mason, the train's second in command -- and looks and plays her part as if she popped right out of some crazed and drug-induced hyper-Oz.  In the actress's own words, ""[my character is] a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns,"" and adds she designed her character as a mixture of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Silvio Berlusconi and Adolf Hitler.  In a famous scene, her character holds up a dilapidated shoe and she says, ""Now, as in the beginning, I belong to the front. You belong to the tail.  When the foot seeks the place of the head, the sacred line is crossed.  Know your place.  BE A SHOE.""  You have to see her performance to believe it.

But everything about ""Snowpiercer"", from the amazing production design and the kinky costumes to its rapid-fire editing and kinetic music score, is first-rate, and it is easily one of the most imaginative and exciting films in recent years.",1424995200,,1482,4.876494023904383

6352347,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"After the world is thrown into a deep freeze, the last vestiges of humanity are trapped aboard a speeding train, arranged by class: the poorest in the tail, eating protein bars and being culled and ordered around by those from the front, the aristocrats who dine on steak and sushi. But a revolution is brewing, led by the headstrong Curtis. Their goal: to make it to the front of the train. By any means necessary.

SNOWPIERCER is flawed. Let's get that out of the way first: on hindsight, it doesn't really make much sense. The story is delightfully dark and twisted (it's not a feel-good movie), but doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. Not to mention various plot holes that dot the film like swiss cheese.

There. We've got that out of the way. Now dig this: SNOWPIERCER is better than you're probably expecting. It is, and I don't say this lightly, one of the most beautifully directed and orchestrated films I've seen in a long time. Thanks to Joon-ho Bong, it's a Hollywood dystopian action film with heavy Asian sensibilities; at times, you'll forget you're watching a Chris Evans vehicle, and instead think you're watching art. Which, in many respects, it is. Oh yes, you have fine performances: Chris Evans, Khang-ho Song, Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, Vlad Ivanov, Alison Pill, and Jamie Bell stand out, while Tilda Swinton was downright incredible. (I've heard talk that she narrowly missed out on an Oscar nomination, and this doesn't surprise me in the slightest.) Oh, and a cameo near the end that I won't ruin. Always a welcomed face.

But there's more than that. What the script lacks in coherence, it makes up for in audacity, brutality, and a strange sense of wonder. All carried out artfully, with beautiful cinematography and a fine eye for detail. SNOWPIERCER is, as much as anything, an experience. Maybe not a masterpiece, maybe not a classic, but a film that'll certainly be discussed in certain circles for a long time to come.",1424736000,2,1950,4.7976190476190474

Director Bong Joon Ho has constructed a methodical, well-layered plot suggesting that forgotten people can make a difference. Unfortunately, violence ensues.

The surprise here is that the ensemble cast, good writing and high production values create a world of its own, claustrophobic and uncomfortable, in a seemingly impossible situation.

The acting is above average, with Chris Evans and Jamie Bell providing the good guy buddies who attempt to find their redemption, with generous support from Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, Ko Asing, Song Kang Ho and an impressive ensemble of ""heroes"" who will claim their place in the new world. Ed Harris has been somewhat type-cast as a crazy person, and it almost works here.

The setting is bleak, yet has some of the best Art Direction/Production Design I've seen in a long time.

So there's a train that is going around the world and can't stop and everyone on board is what's left of humanity. I immediately had questions.

1. Why can't the train stop? What happens if it does?
2. If everyone alive is on the train, who maintains the tracks and bridges?
3. What powers the train if they can't stop for fuel?
4. Why can they build a train the can run non-stop but can't stop the train and build a place to live?

People assured me that all would probably be answered in the movie. Some were, some weren't.

Then the trailer came out and I thought ""wow, those effects look pretty nice"" and once the movie came out, the reviews were through the roof, they couldn't say enough about it.

6352409,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"The movie starts out very powerfully and coherently.  Everything we need to establish the movie is given with extreme competence - the cinematography/look of The Tail, the frozen arm/speech, the counting ceremony, the protein blocs, the interaction with the violinist and his wife etc.  It works REALLY well.  The characters, their motivations and feelings are clear and consistent with their environment and the events in it.

However, it's almost as if you can hear the shrieking of brakes going for the rest of the movie, as if someone were trying to undo all the gathered momentum built up in the beginning of this movie.  They had a powerful, compelling world, characters, and storyline - basically all they  had to do was not screw it up - it would almost write itself from there.  But they did.

It almost has the feel of a GOOD writer or writing team writing something coherent, with a rather bad hollywood writer - someone like Damon Lindelof - coming in and ""fixing"" it by utterly ruining it.

As they enter the car with all the executioner-masked bad guys, the movie detaches from reality and increasingly enters a dreamworld where motiviations, feelings, and goals have no consistency, where actions have no consequences and consequences have no actions.

Actual events depicted in the movie cover the course of... what, 4 days?  Yet compelling characters turn into zombies, into dream-things - they are clearly no longer people.  Apparently all you have to do to turn a sensitive, caring husband violinist into a windup robot is put him in a tuxedo.  He walks into the train car and begins performing - 5 feet away from him are people he knows from The Tail - he doesn't ask how his wife is or go running to meet her despite yelling to her a few days back how he would somehow make it back to her.  On their side, from 5 feet away from him, the people in the tail discuss him as if he were an object.  Children, taken 3 days ago move about as if they were robots, unresponsive to being called by name.  Passing through the front of the train, the invaders provoke little response from the front-enders - they go through their paces like windup toys.  The denziens of the front are dream-things, not human beings.  No one really attempts to engage them, test them in conversation, they are ACCEPTED by the tailenders AS scenery uquestioningly - so the film doesn't seem to be aware of what it is saying if it were saying something about all humans being robotic meaningless cogs in a ""balanced"" machine.

I could go into many specifics that would take a few pages to lay out but that's basically where it falls apart.  It turns into Alice in Wonderland/Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory - a weird bad dream.  It COULD have gone dreamlike and allegorical, that would have been fine.  But you at least have some consistency in your theme, what you're trying to say.

Best analogy I can think of to describe it - say you're at a nice upper-class or upper-middle-class house for Christmas.  The extended family is all there with people from all walks of life.  An interesting topic for conversation comes up - perhaps something related to current events.  Someone points out something very INTERESTING but unfortunately several of the wealthier members of the family would be pointed out to have their hands directly dirtied by it - the nice house and furnishing, the nice neighborhood - would be revealed in polite conversation at the dining table in that very house - to have been ""earned"" at the cost of exploitation and misery of others.  So the person cuts themselves off suddenly as they are saying it and everyone joins in with a lot of chatter - anything to fill up space, get away from what was being said, the purpose being to run down the clock without revisiting the topic until everyone leaves at the end of the evening.

It's as if Snowpiercer is running down the clock after the first 20 minutes, just trying to get to the end without again seriously addressing the themes introduced in the beginning.  Just stall.  Fill the movie with ""stuff"" until we can have an ending.

We start off seeing a dehumanizing elite that has become irrational, entitled, cruel.  The lead character wants to change things.  When we get to the end of the train, he's asked to take charge - that WAS the whole point of his efforts, take control of the engine.  The response of our heroes, when confronted with the responsibility of running things, is to destroy everything and kill everyone - and the film displays no awareness OF this.  A man gives his arm to sustain life and prevent more violence... a man, greatly moved to nobler motivations by this sacrifice... uses his arm to kill every victim he was trying to help.

The initial implication seemed to be that the train (allegorically the world) could be run without the haze of arrogance, entitlement, and cruelty the elites were functioning in, but ends with showing the heroes being only able to destroy, not manage, certainly not build or create.  It is almost as if the film, initially championing the underdog, in the end says ""yes, BE a shoe"" without being consciously aware that it has turned around to say the opposite of what it originally said.  There's no conscious recognition of the tragedy of destroying everything in an effort to improve it.

By the time the engine is reached, the movie is probably already lost, but some deft exposition and a different ending could have left the viewer SOMEWHAT satisfied.  Unfortunately the Engineer here is about as unsatisfying as the Engineer in Prometheus.  The Engineer in Prometheus is essentially indistinguishable from the other monsters in the movie.  He has no horrifying revelations to give the characters, no profound statements to make - he comes simply to physically attack the heroine like any other monster.

The Engineer in Snowpiercer is about as bad - the Engineer at the very front has about as much blank, unthinking superiority as the black-clad  security officer did at the very tail when he told the violinist to bring both his hands.  Essentially, our hero travels his entire distance, all the dangers, and behind the final door is just another black clad security guard with the same basic things to say - just wearing a bathrobe.

Yes, children are required to work inside the machinery to make it go.  But they CANNOT work there forever - it is established that adults won't fit in the spaces.  For the children to HAVE a future, the train has to run.  Stop the train, kill the children.  If children work the machinery, at least they get to have the rest of their lives as opposed to nothing - the Engineer never makes this argument.

Maybe putting ALL the children in shifts instead of just working children from The Tail would be a better way to organize things?  In a generation, everyone would have a common experience of hard work, of keeping their little world going?  No?

It becomes clear what The Tail is for - why it is an integral part of the balance - they ""harvest"" it for children, which is the only thing keeping everything going for everyone.  All that talk of the Tail section being freeloaders and they turn out to be THE vital component of the whole balanced system - you could eliminate most of the front-section people in their salons and hottubs and the train would still run, humanity and all the various preserved species would still survive.  No one brings that up either.

Instead we get a lot of glib hollywood stock phrases.  In the end, the movie seems to be saying that human striving is pointless, fruitless, no improvement is possible.  Attempts at improvement end in pointlessness and trundling along as it is without change is pointless.  Reacting to the system by destroying everything is pointless.  And since the movie isn't at all aware of making that type of existential/nihilistic statement, the end statement the movie makes is about ITSELF - the point made is that the movie itself is pointless - that it was pointless to try to make a movie like this, about this type of thing.

The movie starts to say something coherent, meaningful, compelling.  Something that could support a lot of entertaining action and exposition.  It spends the final 80% strenuously pulling the punch it started to throw.  If anything, the final 80% of the film seems to be an attempt to actively discredit any point being made in the first 20% but without any self-awareness of doing so.  However, if you approach it as sort of a campy B action movie with some interesting scenes and clever one-off ideas, you can enjoy it on that basis.  It is well made in that sense.

===========

On further reflection, I can't resist adding more.

the girl stepped outside at the end in torn spandex leggings and a fur jacket.  All I could hear inside my head while looking around at all the mountains was  ""At this altitude, it should freeze in 7 minutes.  At this altitude, it should freeze in 7 minutes.  At this altitude, it should freeze in 7 minutes...""

They make it to the initially undefended school car full of front-ender children.  They stand there scratching their heads saying ""hey, you front enders took our children, anyone know where OUR children are?  The front-enders took them..."" scanning quizzically, confusedly, idiotically across a horde of FRONT-ENDER CHILDREN.  SERIOUSLY!?!?!?!?

You're at war with a bunch who you swore had to be ""rooted out.""  They've stolen from, imprisoned, starved, maltreated, tortured, maimed, and kidnapped your people.  You recently fought several bloody battles against them.  You want them to give your children back.  You have all of THEIR children in front of you.  Oh what to do, what to do.

Do you think you might want to TAKE SOME HOSTAGES to trade for your own children?  To at least ensure the SAFETY of your children?  To fend off any TRICKS the enemy may try?  Just riffing here but would taking EVERY front-ender they came across prisoner ESPECIALLY front-ender children seriously NOT come across the minds of people at war against a superior enemy?

It's as if these people feel obligated to put in a word about the children for form's sake but don't ACTUALLY care about the children.  This weird, affect-less, dreamlike state for all the characters is continual throughout the movie.
----
All the authority figures assure us BALANCE must be kept - they continually equate a rather stark class distinction to homeostasis.  As if the manta rays and chickens etc won't be able to maintain balance without the super-rich living it up in a profligate manner while the poor are beaten, have their children stolen, and eat nothing but bugs.

Why does NO ONE say, ""Hey, I got to the front and you guys are incredibly WASTEFUL!  You aren't maintaining a balance at all!  Who am I going to believe, you or my lying eyes?""  But this ""balance"" argument goes without challenge.(!)

The film neuters its own premise.  The Tail-enders' objection is essentially to horribly bad MISMANAGEMENT.  After the fish-fight, the issue of the frontenders' DESPOTISM and misallocation of resources seems to disappear.  As does any expectation of further hostility - this after the frontenders show they have no mercy and a penchant for slaughter and cruelty.  They go from a group fighting for their lives to steerage-class passengers sneaking into first class and wandering around.  What happened before doesn't matter so apparently it's a surprise when people start shooting at them.

When did Curtis (Chris Evans) become An Expert In Things That Have Never, Ever Happened!?!?!

--How did he know the particular wheel he chose to stick his arm in would stop the train?  What if it ran, say, the secondary auxiliary cooling system and would stop the train in a couple months... or maybe it ran the hot tub or sauna room, therefore NEVER stop the train?

--How did he know his arm COULD stop the wheel?  How did he know the ginormous, incredibly fast-spinning wheel of solid steel wouldn't immediately break his arm, leaving it to flap ineffectually like a baseball card in the rear wheel spokes of a bicycle?

--how did he know there was no other way to get the kid out?  How did they get the kid IN that spot in the first place?  Same arm-method?  Maybe he is free to crawl out sideways and up through some other hatch?  Maybe he should ASK FIRST?  Hey kid?  Do they let you out for lunch?  Think you can come out that way?  Or is he an Expert In Things That Have Never Ever Happened?

--why didn't he grab the chair 3 feet away and use that to block the wheel?

--why didn't he accept the offer of control of the train and then stop it by... stopping it?  And then let all the children climb out instead of dying horribly inside?

--Why didn't he accept the offer of control of the train and then stop it somewhere other than high, high in Himalayas.  Why didn't he wait until he was near the ocean near the equator and THEN stop it to give people a fighting chance against the cold?

--why didn't he give us a little exposition on why he'd changed from a leader trying to get the best for his people to a psycho trying to kill everyone?  Does talking to a train-obsessed bald jerk make you lose your mind and look for some way to kill the human race with your arm?

--why does he try to engage passing children in idle chitchat while having his arm crushed by heavy machinery?  How exactly does he maintain his composure for this purpose?

--when did he learn to shoot a 32 calibre machine pistol 200 yards through a blowing snowstorm FROM a moving object AT a moving object to make a perfect head-shot?  Was that sometime BEFORE he was 16 years old and boarded the tail of the train?  After?  Did he join Delta Force or become a Navy Seal when he was 12 or what?  How did he learn to make a shot no one has ever been able, nor will ever be able to make?  Did they pass out weapons and ammunition to the people in The Tail to keep up their shooting skills?  Do they at least have a playstation where they take turns playing Call of Duty back there in The Tail?  No?  The Scorpoin vz61 is a 32 calibre machine pistol.  Do you realize how tiny a round that is or how the wind would blow it around for 200 yards before it could reach its target?  Did the director wave away a 9mm submachinegun for the scene saying  ""No, no you stupid interns, I want a TRULY idiotic gun to make a 200 yard shot with, not just ridiculous!""

-----

What was the TONE for this movie?  The character doesn't seem to be warring between considered strategy and passion.  He just goes promptly, immediately insane after forgetting his goal between fish-car and engine room.

When you have a dour, taciturn character who makes gigantic leaps in behavior without any character arc, it helps to have a foil.  A Jimminy Cricket type character trying to be an angel on their shoulder making appeals to compassion or reason. Alternatively, you can have a Shakespearean fool type character that covers your comedic action while throwing out the painful truth.  Where is this character?  If you cannot reveal inner tension or character arc via the character themselves because they are too taciturn, use a foil to show it.  Nope.

If the theme of the story is humankind's folly, of screwing things up despite good intentions, where's the TONE of the movie communicating that?  It establishes itself as Braveheart on a Train, then turns listless and expressionless.

Where's Charlton Heston outside the train on his knees in the snow shouting ""You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!"" ?

The girl who gets off the train - the one who set off the explosive - doesn't seem to be experiencing anything along the lines of ""oh my god I just caused the extinction of humanity along with the extinction of another 100 species or so.""  Nor does she look back at the train with regret, or scorn, or worry, or insouciance.  It's apparently just another part of her life.  I was woken up and sniffed some drugs.  And then I walked a ways.  Then I blew up a door and killed humanity.  Then I saw a polar bear.

6352418,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Who would think a movie set entirely on a train could be so bizarre and entertaining? I suppose it helps when its directed by Bong Joon-ho, director of some amazing South Korean films like ""The Host"" and ""Memories of Murder"". Theres a striking visual style that comes from his films, and the visceral action of South Korean Cinema is translated to great effect.

The story is an adaptation of the French graphic novel, Le Transperceneige, by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette, and the premise is fairly simple. In a post-apocalyptic world where the downfall came as a result of global warming, earth has frozen over to become an arctic wasteland. The Ark, for all thats left of humanity, is crazily in the form of a giant train. A self-sustaining train that will run across tracks that span the globe forever. As far as post-apocalyptic action settings go, this one is especially ludicrous, but thats also what makes it so interesting.

One of the many aspects of humanity to be carried into the train is the class system, measured by where one dwells. If you live in the tail section, you are the lowest level there is. If you live in the front, you're among the elite. You get to dance, eat real food, and don't have to worry about whether gunmen will steal your children for reasons unknown.

The first portion of the movie is spent in the tail, where people are crowded into the cars with their families and belongings, living off of gelatin food bars and plotting their coup. Curtis Everett (Chris Evans) is the reluctant leader of the downtrodden, following the advice of the sage-like amputee, Gilliam (played by John Hurt). Their plan is to rescue an imprisoned security technician (Song Kang-Ho) and have him, along with his clairvoyant daughter (Go Ah-sung), lead their ragtag army all the way to the sacred engine room.

Despite being set entirely on a train, the visuals are impressive and varying. The tail is the grungy, gritty steam punk nightmare while the further on they fight, the more radical and downright bizarre the world (as it is a train) becomes. Every car is completely different from the last, all the way to the very front, where lies the engine, a machine worshiped along with its creator as a sacred religious icon.

There are only so many shots outside the thick walls of the train, so almost everything you see is set within. This is where the sets really stand out here, for each one is a drastic and surprising shift as they move from one car to the next. In one there might be a classroom, in another, a sushi bar. Even seeing a window is something startling, for in the tail there are none to be found. Despite being set in one giant location, theres nothing monotonous about moving from one space to another.

Bong Joon-hos flair for action is in prominent display, pushing desperate characters to extreme action in violent and often creative ways, one example being Curtis and a gunman shooting at each other through windows while the train bends around a mountain. The train, being as long as it is, allows for both of them to fire as though they're facing each other. To go along with such insane action, you need insane villains (which is something often found in violent South Korean action movies). Theres no shortage of that here, whether its the thug who just won't die, the psychotic and pregnant teacher (Alison Pill), or Tilda Swinton as Mason, an eccentric, cowardly, and over-the-top minister. All of them add to the strange world that is the train.

Theres a theme of control, in this case the control of ones eco system. Given the confined space and the limited resources, everything aboard the train must be meticulously measured and accounted for, including population and the more obvious being food and water. There are far more aspects of live being guided however, and the reasons behind some of it is so downright crazy that it would be a shame to spoil it.

Bong Joon-ho is an excellent choice for bridging Hollywood and South Korean Cinema together, crafting an accessible and thrilling story without losing any of his unique style.

On the other hand, if you're the type that can't stop picking at loose threads, the whole fabric is bound to fall apart. I usually find myself somewhere in between those two extremes, but during Snowpiercer I was able to silence the critic in the back of my head long enough to enjoy the ride. And it's quite the experience, brimming with blunt (yet, strangely charming) metaphors and social commentaries, abrupt, brutal doses of gang warfare and all manner of high-concept weirdness. It's an especially well-realized nightmare, too, with a rapidly-shifting visual style, effective matching changes in the cinematography and constant, subtle background reminders of the strange setting. The plot does have its struggles, most of which probably could have been tidied by an attentive editor, but at the end of the day that kind of reckless disregard for the rules serves to make it even more unpredictable and fascinating. Very dark, especially in the mindbending third act, it's as fresh a spectacle as I've seen in quite a while.",1421712000,,1442,5.0886075949367084

6352426,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic movies. However, there's a simple fact the majority of post-apocalyptic fiction isn't very good. Writing about, literally, the most depressive thing possible is hard enough. Doing so in a way which doesn't break your suspension of disbelief or, if it does, allows you to go for the ride anyway is even harder. Moreover, I have the additional qualifiers of wanting my apocalypses to say something as well as be entertaining.

  So what do I think of Snowpiecer?

  I like it.

  Mostly.

  The premise of Snowpiercer is a failed experiment to stop global warming has resulted in the entire world becoming a frozen ice cube. A billionaire industrialist named Wilford has created a perpetual motion machine to power a train which he uses to ferry the last survivors of humanity around the world forever. On a literal level, this makes no sense as any practical person would recognize there's nothing you could do on a trail you couldn't do better in an underground base or compound. However, on a symbolic level, it makes perfect sense for capitalism.

  The function of capitalism is to go round and round the world to produce stuff which exists to fund more capitalism. Trains also have another symbolic meaning as they have a special place in the writings of Ayn Rand. Does it make sense on a practical level to have a train as the last resource of humanity? No. However, it doesn't need to be practical because the guy who created the train is implied to have done so because he liked trains more than buildings. Snowpiecer takes place in a world where entire civilizations are at the whims of the rich.

  The situation on board is beyond desperate as the bottom half of the train's cars are filled with people treated worse than animals. They aren't even used as a source of cheap labor, so much as they're kept there in horrible conditions only to have their children removed at various times, never to be seen again.

  So, you can guess they're ripe for revolt.

  The movie follows the struggles of Curtis (Chris Evans) as he moves from train-car to- train-car, attempting to reach the engine. He is helped in this struggle by Gilliam (John Hurt), who holds a place of great importance to the survivors. Kidnapping a drugged-out security expert who doesn't speak English, the revolutionaries have only a small chance of succeeding. Even if they do, the train is the only thing keeping them all alive.

  Or is it?

  Snowpiercer, like Brazil, functions on dream logic more than anything else. Wilford's train is like the Nine Circles of Hell, each containing a differently horrible sort of location. Even the wealthy live in a horrible set of conditions, brainwashed into a nihilistic drug-filled world of empty pleasures where their families exist solely to venerate Wilford but promise no real hope for a better tomorrow.

  Much of the movie's social satire depends on a simple fundamental premise: Capitalism is a system which provides survival but is it the absolute best system we could have given it also generates caste-like class systems as well as immense suffering? I.e. is it possible to do better? The answer posited by the movie is, ""We don't know.""

  Revolution may or may not be the answer because the people on the ground frequently don't have any better answers than the people above them. It's an unflinching portrayal of the good, bad, and ugly side of class relations even if it's also ludicrous in places.

6352427,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer is a confusing mess of a movie unable to sustain its lofty premise.  The future is very cold, and the best way to stay alive is on a train circumnavigating the globe.  That immediately makes no sense and incurs dozens of logistical issues.  I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole, because it turns out to be an endless abyss (they have steaks but no cows, who maintains the rails, why a train and not a bunker, etc etc oh god I'm getting dizzy).

If you're able to look past that, what's left vaguely resembles Dante's journey through the Inferno, as each train car represents a different ring of hell.  Society is stratified, with the lowly commoners at the back of the train, and the nobility inhabiting the front.  The movie evokes social and political commentary without really making a profound or insightful statement about either.

Chris Evans always plays a competent lead, with some quirky but admirable support from costars John Hurt and Tilda Swinton.  Unfortunately their perfomances just weren't enough to carry me through the increasingly illogical plot of this stylistic but ultimately thoughtless movie.

Snowpiercer was praised by many critics, for which what I've dubbed as the ""Foreign Movie Effect.""  Take a poorly scripted/directed movie, stylize it, add an incomprehensible plot, and you've got a total dud.  Now make it a foreign movie.  Suddenly incomprehensibility becomes inspiration!

Look, the bottom line is, will you enjoy it?  If you're like me and can find fun in weird scifi movies without necessarily praising them for qualities they don't have, then go ahead and watch Snowpiercer.  I'm glad I did.  If you can't get past the gaping holes in the movie's logic, just skip it for your own sanity.",1421539200,,1744,4.941580756013746

The ""worthless"" live in horrible conditions and survive on one protein bar a day. No surprise that a plan is hatched to move forward to the front.

SNOWPIERCER is a dark film to watch and not just in regards to theme. The setting is dark and poorly lit. The train seems cavernous and it was hard to accept they were on a train. OK, it does star Chris Evans, John Hirt and Tilda Swindon (doing a very strange accent) yet their talents are wasted.

SPOILER:  However, I don't think it would be a good idea to put a night club car where everyone is getting drunk and high on drugs right next to the main engine room...Also, they want to blow a hole in the train to get into the wilderness because they think the snow is melting yet it's still a freaking ice age outside.

I read a brief synopsis from Wikipedia and this doesn't even go near its source material. Is that necessarily a terrible thing? Well, I'm not one to judge since I never heard of this tale until now. But as a movie, I liked it as I was surprised by how deep and engrossing it became. At first you think the movie is a simple revolution tale in a post apocalyptic setting. Instead of in a broken down city, or a desert, it's a always moving train. Yes, there were some strange character development, setting aesthetics, plot techniques that some might try to nitpick or guess the ending half way. Then BOOM! that final act hits and I became engrossed with the characters's truths and reveals.
But only 3 stars overall!? Seriously? This movie is easily above that especially during the final act of the film. So this movie gets a lower star rating than X-Men: Origins: Wolverine??????
The movie becomes an emotional train wreck. Not in the metaphorical labeling of terrible, mind you, but more of the realization of character reasoning and plot explanation. Almost like playing a good story based video game to me. Some parts reminded me of Fallout and some parts where Chris Evans has to choose to press on, I felt reminiscent of making hard choices in the Witcher or Mass Effect series.

Don't listen to the 3 or below ratings. In fact, make your own opinion by just checking out this gritty tale. It's easily worth a weekend rental.",1420588800,,1558,4.665454545454545

The next 30 minutes I spent slowly becoming more intrigued with the cinematography, the Orwellian dialogue, and the action sequences, while at the same time continuing to suspend belief regarding the train. Then, about half way through, the train thing was explained and suddenly the whole movie moved into a new level of seriousness and respect. From that point until the end, it simply got more and more interesting. The dialogue and characters (particularly the woman with the glasses who is in charge of things) reminds you of the movie Brazil, the philosophical undercurrent is reminiscent of the movie Runaway Train (which I believe was also a Japanese film?), and the cinematography is excellent. Not only that, but the plot develops in unexpected ways and the action sequences are brilliant. There is a lot of allegory in this film. It's going to take a second and third viewing for me to pick up on more of it. In short, this is quite an intruiguing film with a powerful message that is partially explained by Wilbur in his monologue at the end.

6352494,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"This film is one of my favorite films of the year. I agree that not everyone might like it. My mother and sister both thought that it sucked but I on the other hand loved the message the film gave off. First of all the film is based on a french graphic novel and follows its premise though it is loosely connected to it. The Director is Korean and something I have to point out is that Korean's usually have a dark approach to their films and it has been clearly shown here. The movie is dark and shares an ambiguous nature that I occasionally see in Korean films. This is possibly the primary reason there has bee so many negative reviews of the film here because most americans are no accustomed to that.

The story of the film is complex and outright disturbing in some parts but it is illustrated to show the desperation of humanity in times of need. It challenges issues about morality in times of turmoil, criticizes the social hierarchy that distinguishes the rich from the poor, and most of all it highlights the decisions people make when there is little chance of survival. It makes you think about whether the decisions that the main characters in the film made the right choice or not. Were they fighting for others or out of their own selfish desires?

I found myself captivated by all the movie had shared with me. The negatives of group think and the human limits of survival. The fight scenes were beautifully orchestrated and I must applaud the film for its brilliance. I know not many share my opinion but I encourage people to look deeper into the plot because this movie is exceptional underneath the surface.",1420156800,2,1629,4.537414965986395

6352498,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"This movie was on the Rotten Tomatoes ""Best Movies Off the Radar"" list for 2014.  It turns out there's a reason why some movies stay off the radar.  It's because they're TERRIBLE, and 'Snowpiercer' is no exception.  The most remarkable thing about this movie is that it manages to get a cast of really good actors to slog their way through a story of revolution set aboard a train going in a continuous loop around the world, which by the way is in the midst of an ice age induced after an attempt to halt global warming backfires disastrously.  Life aboard the train is segregated between paying first class passengers in the front, and freeloaders in the back.  After seventeen years of eating glutinous protein matter, the freeloaders in the back decide it's time to take a hike to the front.

Tilda Swinton stands out with her broad, over-the-top performance, exactly what this material needs (the story is an adaptation of a French graphic novel).  Unfortunately the director plays it straight and wastes most of the rest of the cast.

Much significant plot material is delivered in a seven-minute monologue towards the end of the movie.  The story would have been better served had this backstory been told in flashback much earlier, so we could better understand some relationships and feel a deeper sense of loss when characters exited the story.

The directory is overly fond of ""jiggle-cam"", used so extensively during the action sequences that it's hard to tell what's going on.",1420070400,19,1489,4.849802371541502

The director creates a beautiful masterpiece. The use of color and light is on point. The sound is great although on occasion it drowned out dialogue.

Director Bong Joon-ho demonstrates here that you can have it all and the money spent on CGI is nothing without a plausible narrative and characters to care about.  This film reminded me of a film from 1985, ""Runaway Train"".  In both cases the passengers aboard the locomotive racing across snow swept vistas served as a metaphor for society at large.  There is a complexity to the characters with the possible exception of Tilda Swinton who plays the spokesperson for the elites.  Swinton is given a pair of fake choppers to chew the scenery with aplomb.  Chris Evans who plays the leader of the underclass rebels is given a plausible backstory that adds dark shading to his character.  On the reverse Ed Harris' train designer is engendered with some sympathy because he confuses his misguided actions as altruistic endeavors.  The film is a visual feast creating worlds previously unexplored in cinema which is a rare thing these days.  Along with this film, ""Edge of Tomorrow', and ""Interstellar"" 2014 proved to be a banner year for fantasy films.",1419724800,5,1149,5.005263157894737

6352537,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"I don't particularly want to say enough about this movie for it to be feasible for me to hide spoilers under a mountain of text, and I tend to spoil things for people inadvertently, so if you're a wussy baby who can't stand spoilers just take this as a five-star review because I thought the movie was excellent despite the fact that pretty much everyone dies.
I'm serious; there are only two *confirmed* survivors of the train wreck.
There, got that out of my system; feels good.
Okay, this is not a happy film; it is not whimsical, it is not something you should show to your kids (the kids you're babysitting are fine; let their parents deal with the psychological damage later on)
It's not a gory movie, it's really just gritty. In terms of violence it strikes me as similar to Deadfall, if you are familiar with that. Frankly, I'm not going to say if you liked Deadfall you'll like this because I DIDN'T like Deadfall, and I really like this movie.
So after all that this movie is not, what IS it? Well, it is difficult to say. Storywise, it's the tale of how a man starts an uprising and derails a train. I believe I agree somewhat that the underlying message is left somewhat to the imagination, though I will say that it is telling that no one in the forward cars helps anyone in the uprising. NO ONE. To me, as a Christian, I view this as more than a morality tale about classes, though. This is the natural progression of an evolutionary worldview; people are viewed as cogs in a machine. Literally. They work together (you will never watch that scene in The Incredibles the same again), and the world works smoothly until a cog decides its place is somewhere else.
God is never brought up, never mentioned except in profanity; there are symbols, but again, a good deal is left to the imagination. Wilford never says he is a god, but he certainly acts like one. Children sing songs about him and Mason reveres him and his ""Sacred Engine"" which he says is ""eternity"". In the end, though, it is not truly perpetual and eternal; two small children have to tend it to keep it going. It is a false religion, and ultimately destroys itself. The last piece of more or less overt symbolism is that the two survivors are a boy and a girl. Adam and Eve sort of thing. I mean, there might have been other survivors, but not many were dressed for the cold, so...
I'm probably reaching a bit; these are mainly just thoughts that were evoked as I was watching the movie. This is truly a horrifying film; there are no jump scares, there is no supernatural entity, no hot chick descending into the basement in her nightie; this is the fear of human depravity, and what we will do to restore our so-called balanced lives.
Did I enjoy it?
Yes, in an odd way; after the first few brutal murders of characters I had grown attached to, the ones after seemed a good deal more inevitable and I could relax knowing that nobody I loved was going to survive (which, incidentally, wasn't exactly how things worked out, but that's just me).
Would I recommend this movie?
Well, I'd recommend you watch it before you comment on my review. As for if I'd actually recommend it otherwise...I don't know. As I said, I enjoyed it, and that's part of the movie's odd charm. The oppressed rise up against the oppressor in a way that is brutal in itself, but not what I would consider gratuitous. As I said, this is not a gory movie; bloody, but with a purpose in mind rather than a slasher. That said, I found that the emotions evoked from watching this movie (and there are plenty of emotional moments) were not particularly decent emotions. Let's look at an example: you hate Wilford. The movie makes you hate him more than any other character. I wish he had not died in the explosion, but rather had been stabbed because the hatred I felt for him was almost PERSONAL.
So I can't really say; I leave that up to you.
Oh, and, sorry if the sarcasm about spoilers made you mad; I spoiled myself and I was still able to be immersed in it; I can never understand people who get upset about crap like that.",1419638400,,4075,4.427430093209055

Although the odds of humans surviving climate change on a train that never stops are slim to nothing, I think the story is worth watching because climate change is taking place and could cause civilization as we know it to collapse and humans to end up struggling for survival.

The train is more of a metaphor for what might happen in a closed and controlled environmentand that might be the only way the human race survives. In fact, with what Bill Gates is doing to destroy public education in the United States, and how the Koch brothers are funding climate denial, the idea of a few billionaires controlling the survivors after a climate change disaster isn't that farfetched. On that note, did you know that the CIA is funding climate change experiments?

They are fighting for their place in the world and for their livelihood.  I'd say more but I don't want to spoil it.

So you are entertained, as long as you like violence, as there's a lot of it. Granted a lot of the characters aren't too likeable and you certainly don't really care if they make it there or not (although it's a movie so you know at least a couple will so we get to see those parts of the train).  Visually parts of the train are quite spectacular, even if not really plausible, the underwater observatory somehow squeezed onto a carriage where the height is still standable for one.  The train itself raises huge questions such as where do the kids in the classroom part live, I could buy they sleep in the classroom but it doesn't look it, and why put the aquarium, which you would imagine would be a nice place where they and anyone else privileged enough to go, not immediately next to the classroom, instead they have to walk through a freezer full of dead cows to get there.  It also seems the most logical defence to an uprising of the classes would have been to have a few flat bed carriages, where people would have to put on protective warm clothing to venture outside and get from one end to the other, you could easily build some sort of sheltered room at the northern end of one and position rifles slots in its south facing wall to house guards when their colleagues are visiting the end of the train and take out enemies if they kill and wear the clothing the guards used as they try and get towards the front.

There's plenty of holes you could talk about.  Why did the train even need to be moving at all?  Perhaps the plot would have been more plausible if it was in a specifically built building and the tail end class had to fight their way to the top.  Or even on board a ship, or since it's the future a long space ship or something, anything where you don't have to wonder about who is clearing the track and fixing any damage to the rails.",1418947200,3,2131,4.366161616161616

The whole killing/eating babies situation also makes no sense: if there was a month without food, the children would be the first to die, so there would be no need to kill them.  Also, in many other situations throughout history where starvation occurs in a population, killing people never/rarely occurs (eating them after death, yes, but killing them for food doesn't happen).

6352615,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"""Snowpiercer"" is one of those sci-fi films that has a seemingly simple premise rife with symbolism. It doesn't really hold up under prolonged examination, but then ""Snowpiercer"" is more parable than movie.

To wit, global warming has frozen the earth, accelerated by the very attempts to halt it. The last of humanity is huddled on a massive, perpetual-motion train known as the Snowpiercer. But even in this closed ecosystem the old class struggles erupt, from the have-nots in the back to the hedonists in the front. Finally fed up with the inhumane treatment and kidnapping of their youngest children, a ragtag band of rebels decide they're going to fight their way to the front of the train and take it over. They include the reluctant leader Curtis Everett (Chris Evans), his gee-whiz second Edgar (Jamie Bell), determined mother Tanya (Octavia Spencer), security specialist and drug addict Namgoong Minsu (Song Kang-ho), and his daughter Yona (Go Ah-sung).

The battle takes place car-by-car, one bloody guard at a time. Because director Bong Joon-ho is primarily interested in cinematography, logic holes open up a few cars in. Characters stand around in enemy territory (basically, any car beyond the back few) in slack-jawed awe, villains survive who should be dead, and twists are telegraphed with all the subtlety of a freight train. This is one of those films that's big on concept and short on logic.

The biggest problem is that after being betrayed by ""civilians"" who appeared innocent in the very first upper-class car they encounter, our heroes never learn from that lesson -- they act as if what's behind them is never a threat, only what's ahead of them, despite the fact that they leave an entire train's worth of potential enemies behind them. Of course, to do that would rob the film of its forward narrative -- it would turn into a siege rather than a desperate battle of forward attrition -- so director Joon-ho just plunges ahead and hopes you forgive him.

The logic fallacies are easy to forgive. What's on film is frequently gorgeous, brutal, and inventive. The snaking nature of a train surrounded by a hostile environment opens up a lot of possibilities for protracted combat. The conclusion is rife with symbolism of clenched fists -- the fist of the worker, the fist of the slave, the fist of the oppressor. It just takes a long, winding path to get there, punctuated by weird choices by characters who frequently appear insane. To be fair, there's a toss-off line that the only people who are still alive on the train ARE insane, but that's a bit of a dodge that robs the entire struggle of its urgency.

In the end, ""Snowpiercer"" doesn't have a lot of nice things to say about humanity. This is one of those movies film critics love to applaud for its edginess. It's a highly ambitious concept film that only partially succeeds. But what it does achieve is still worth watching.",1417910400,4,2912,4.862903225806452

This was just boring and not entertaining enough to allow the viewer to enjoy the reasons the film was made.",1417651200,5,685,4.448
6352626,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"About halfway through the film, I said to my wife This movie is kinda like THE ROAD WARRIOR.  Post-apocalyptic and full of weird characters.  And that sums it up for me.  Remember all the odd-ball characters (good and bad) in THE ROAD WARRIOR.  And the relative normality and stoicism that Mel Gibson displayed in contract to all the craziness around him.  SNOWPIERCER, for me, evoked a similar reaction.  It is not as good as THE ROAD WARRIOR, but it was still a lot of fun.

The concept is that this train, SNOWPIERCER, contains all that is left of humanity after an attempt to stop global warming backfired and froze the planet.  And the train must keep going all the time, because of its perpetual motion engine.  And just to make is a microcosm of our world, the train is very much divided into classes, with the poor, unwashed huddled masses literally huddling unwashed in the back few cars of the train, and the upper-class living in luxury near the front.  In between are soldiers and engineering-types that keep order and help keep things running.

Apparently, over the 17 years since the end of the world, there have been several failed attempts by the poor folks to make it to the front of the train.  And now, they're ready to try again, led by a somewhat reluctant (and relatively normal) Chris Evans.  When the soldiers come to take a couple of young kids away from their parents for purposes unknown, this serves as a precipitating event for the rebellion.  Evans is joined by the gung-ho Jamie Bell, a wizened, gravelly-voiced John Hurt type of character (played by John Hurt, doing the role he always does these days), a rescue and revenge minded mother (Octavia Spencer) and a motley crew of rebels.  They begin to fight their way up, car by car, and with each new move forward, new secrets and surprises about the train, its operation and its inhabitants is revealed.

There are lots of action scenes, and they are quite violent.  But they aren't particularly gory (I know some folks have a lower threshold for what equals gory than I do)there are lots of stabbings and axe blows, but very little is actually shown.  But believe me, its violent enough.  It reminded me, at times, of 300 and sometimes of THE RAID (although not as brilliantly choreographed).  These scenes were done well enough, BUT weren't really the most compelling thing about the film.  The slow process of revealing secrets was most interesting, as well as the wonderful art direction.  Each train car has its own personality, and some are quite twisted and some are quite lovely.

I have to admit, my favorite part of the movie was Tilda Swinton.  Playing the powerful spokesperson for the leader of the train, she is amazingly loony and oddly funny.  From her gloriously crooked teeth to her thick glasses to her amusing sidebarsshes terrify and amusing.  Chris Evans makes a nice contrast to herand I think its his best performance.  Hes not known for being the worlds greatest actor, but he gets a couple of very effective, emotional monologues in this film, and nails them.  Hes always been an affable guy (who doesnt like him as Captain America), but in this film, he brings some grit to his role and it suits him well.

Weaknesses?  Well, even with all the great revealing of secrets throughout, we never quite figure out how or why the poor folks came to be on the train when hell was freezing over.  The visual rendering (via CGI) of the landscape outside the train shows the budgetary limitationsalthough I feel a bit silly complaining about this when the interior of the train looked so awesome.  And youd better have a TV that can handle dark scenes (my new one, thankfully, can) because the first 30 minutes of the movie is really quite dark.  (More of a warning than a complaint, I guess.)  Finally, the end of the film left me a little unsatisfied.  It makes some bold choices, which I liked, but contained more ambiguity than I cared for.

Not everyone will like SNOWPIERCER.  Its got, perhaps, less action than some might have expected.  Others might not like its decidedly oddball characters.  And others will dislike the ending.  But I enjoyed it a good deal, and very much admired its style and originality.",1417651200,4,4217,4.699863574351978

I think an honest number of stars would be 2.5, but since that is not possible I am rounding up to three.  For my taste, it was a waste of money.

6352629,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer was a film I definitely wanted to see and its gotten some rave reviews from the professionals. Whats interesting is that on Amazon its gotten a very mediocre three star average and a ton of one stars. Given how generous Amazon reviews tend to be I was quite surprised but I think the Amazon reviewers nailed it. My review is going to be filled with spoilers so be forewarned.

I love the concept. As a response to Global Warming the world devises a plan to release a chemical into the atmosphere to cool the Earth except things go awry and the planet is super cooled killing almost everything on the planet except a train load of people with a never ending engine. The train has a stratification of residents with the very poor at the rear, the security in the center and the wealthy closer to the engine. Having endured the abuse of the military long enough, including the taking of children, the rear passengers decide to storm the engine by making their way through all the trains cars.

**** SPOILERS ****
I managed to accept the premise but it was the plot holes that really hurt my enjoyment. Early in the movie one of the rear passengers is punished by having his arm stuck out the side of the train for seven minutes until it was frozen so solid that when tapped it chimed like a bell. A mallet was then used to shatter it. As someone whos lived in Northeast Ohio almost my entire life I know cold and to freeze a limb like that in seven minutes would take more cold than Ive ever experienced. In fact I don't think its physically possible but if it were the cold would have to be off the charts. However later in the film, in an absurd sequence, the train is going around a massive bend and two characters fire guns out windows at each other from about 30 cars away. The train is in a semi-circle so they can fire from one car to another and putting aside the ridiculousness of firing with pin point accuracy from hundreds of yards away from a car moving in one direction towards another car moving in the opposite direction the bigger problem is they break through the windows and seem to feel no discomfort from the cold despite having no protective clothing. Admittedly they only form golf ball sized holes but the film established that this cold was intense beyond belief. I would also say that the gunfight went on WAY to long given the logistics of the train unless it were on a continual corkscrew.

As the film goes on we start to find out maybe it isn't THAT cold outside. BUT THEY ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE SUPER COLD TEMPERATURE BY HAVING A GUYS ARM FREEZE INTO A HUNK OF ICE!!! If I hang my arm out the window in kinda cold weather it would be uncomfortable but it wouldnt turn blue and shatter. Certainly not in 7 minutes. So the movie ends with the train derailing end everyone dying except a women and boy who have their faces entirely unexposed and seem to show no discomfort. They see a polar bear and I can only assume this is the hopeful ending. She and the boy will proceed to repopulate the Earth. BULL. Even if its not as cold as the people on the train thought it is quite clear that the Earth remains an arctic wasteland. So here is what will happen. The two of them will remain with the train scavenging food as long as they can before dying horribly. The End.

So prior to the wreck Chris Evans character reaches the engine where he meets the trains designer, Wilfred, played by Ed Harris. Wilfred explains that this whole attempt to take the engine was planned by himself and a friend/mentor of Evans. In order to keep the biology of train stable they needed to significantly reduce the population and the revolt would serve that purpose except that the invasion was intended to be stopped early on with the death of most of the rear passengers. The plan was that Evans would take over for the aging Wilfred as the trains conductor. Wait! The axe wielding security force was supposed to put down the rebellion and I assume kill Evans. So how was Evans supposed to reach Wilfred and take over if he was dead? Like so many things in the film it makes no sense.

There are a lot of things I like about this film but the plot holes I listed are only some of the most egregious and its certainly not an exhaustive list. I can accept a lot in a science fiction film but they really should stick to their own rules. The ending was just a bummer after the long journey to the trains engine and quite frankly the villain of the film (Wilfred) was actually correct except his boneheaded decision to hand the reigns to Chris Evans. His methods may have been dastardly but he was trying to maintain the last of humanity on a never ending train. I think three stars is a very appropriate score because there are some parts that are well done.",1417651200,3,4775,4.4031710079275195

6352631,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"With the world opening up its borders one of the benefits has been the involvement of foreign film directors into the world market as opposed to just their country of origin. Such is the case with Korean director Joon-ho Bong. Some may be familiar with his giant monster hit THE HOST (if not seek it out). Now he presents his latest film SNOWPIERCER.

The movie takes place in the future. In 2014 in an attempt to save the world from global warming, a world wide decision was made to release a certain element into the atmosphere to bring down the worlds temperature. Unfortunately it worked too well and we were plunged into a new ice age. The only survivors now live aboard a specialized train that circles the northern hemisphere in a pattern that takes them on a year long loop.

The train has its own hierarchy. Those who live neat the engine are at the top of the list, those in the tail the low lifes. Among the back enders is Curtis (Chris Evans), a strong willed young man who wants more for the people who live around him. With the help of long term survivor Gilliam (John Hurt), Curtis has been communicating with someone from the front end of the train. Theyve directed him to a passenger further down the line of cars named Namgoong (Kang-ho Song) who knows how to open the doors of each compartment down the line.

After showing how bad things are for those in the back, we witness the revolution as it begins. Plans long made are brought to fruition and the march forward begins. With each new car more is learned of what has been going on up front. Battles are fought and losses mount with each car. What lies at the end is a mystery to all. But more mysterious is the reason that drives Curtis to continue forward.

The movie is incredibly interesting from start to finish. While weve been presented with end of the world movies before theyve almost all been set in desert wastelands among rag wearing combatants. This time while the low level class may wear rags, the location is much more sterile and cold, a white snow covered world where the only sign of life is the bullet train that moves along fast enough to plow through massive ice blocks and remain on the rails.

The train itself as it unfolds is a fascinating thing to behold. The set designer on this film needs recognition like no other. Each car has a purpose, steadily increasing from basic needs to class comforts. The revelation at the last car, the engine, who is behind it and the purpose of his creating the train is enough to make the light hearted gasp. The same for the final reveal for Curtis.

Evans does a fantastic job here as the leader of the rag tag group in search of a better life. It would be easy to portray Curtis as nothing more than an inflated chest thrusting hero. Instead Evans portrays him as a flawed character, one who doesnt want to lead but finds himself thrust into that position. With that decision comes the weight of responsibility and a call to make choices that have results. An actor without chops would falter in this role. Evans brings it to life.

SNOWPIERCER didn't receive a wide release when it came out, at least not in this area. I can only imagine how great it looked on a big screen. The quality of the film is solid from the grease covered back end rail cars to the posh front. The entire look of the film captures your attention at all times. At no time do you find yourself wondering how long till it ends. Instead you find yourself at the credits asking if its really over. What it made me do is long to see the next film from director Joon-ho Bong. I have little doubt that Ill be watching this one again. Its worth repeat viewings.",1417564800,4,3667,4.431750741839763

6352643,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"When I first saw 'The Host' on TVO, I applauded alone after and became an immediate fan of Bong Joon Ho. On collecting his other works (Memories Of Murder, Barking Dogs Never Bite, Mother, etc.) I was completely enthralled with him and the excellent Korean actors he utilized. So Snowpiercer struck me like a Ang Lee 'sell out' when I first caught wind of it. But being on Joon's 'wavelength' I suspected it wasn't, and hoped he wouldn't let me down. And he certainly didn't! If you're like me, and are getting sick of 'superhero' movies and typical action and sci-fi formats, I think you'll fall for this movie too. It's like a Kurt Vonnegut story adapted by Terry Gilliam, costumed by Jean Paul Gautier, and put together by none other than Bong Joon Ho. It's deep, dank, dismal, and disbelieving that all this level of life could exist on board a 'super train' constantly going around a dead and frozen planet. But then, what is our planet and ourselves rotating around and around in this big empty universe? Chris Evans is excellent, Tilda Swinton goes well beyond, John Hurt breaks a leg, and Ed Harris is so distant and evil. Then to throw in awesome acting by the likes of Kang Ho Song and Ah Sung Ko. So far from their father and daughter characters in The Host, yet more desperate and devoted in this. The ingenuity throughout is remarkable, and disgusting. Believable and disheartening.

So to me, if you can set aside the obstacle of the premise, the movie is a pretty good dystopia and social commentary.  The different sections of the train have different rules.  From the engine to the tail, and also different social norms and expectations.

As the characters revolt and climb forward in the train, more and more is revealed about the ""world"" they live in.

No spoilers, but I found the movie a good ride.  Some graphic violence, and some odd filming (had held effects and jerky picture for fight scenes:  NOTE TO FILM MAKERS:  Stop the handheld jerky filming entirely!!

6352684,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Reading the others reviews and I'm shocked at how some people get paid to downgrade movies. I've shown this movie to 6 other people since I bought it and not one ever even hear of it before I showed it to them but once they watched it they recommended it to other friends. I gave it top billing because I was surprised at how good it was and how different. If you're like me I get bored with the constant murder mystery and who did investigation re-wrapped over and over again trying to be original only to fall short. I'm tired of the Zombie this and the Vampire that ~never ending saga of the talk to talk so we can talk more, type movies.
I needed a movie of struggle but for purpose that didn't match our already mundane existence. This movie had it all.
1) It has the struggle but provides a goal.
2) It has the repression but with purpose.
3) It has the originality but also the tradition.
4) It has surprises and twists of good isn't always good and bad isn't always bad.
5) It reminds us that just existing isn't bad until it is.
The movie has parts that make you think and then it has parts that make you go naww no way~ but it was fun to go along for the ride.
I bet that those who who gave it a poor review really didn't watch the move, they were more like texting and talking though most of it and missed the scope of the film.

6352696,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"This film was totally, totally unexpected for me, but I approached it expecting to be surprised. On the one hand, a brief description of the situation immediately reminds one of ""2012"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"", two weather related apocalypses, heavy on special effects and action of man versus nature. On the other hand, this Korean made ""Snowpiercer"" which replaces giant arks and long treks in the snow with a train (a seemingly corny solution to anything) is getting rave reviews, with a 96% rating on ""Rotten Tomatoes"", while the other sci-fi apocalypses fall around 40 - 50%.

I cannot do much to explain how this happened without giving away too much of what makes the movie work, but I can say that rather than being about humans versus nature, it is far more a story of humans versus humans, very similar to the recent film, ""Elysium"". It is obvious that the point of the train is that the earth is covered by a great freeze and snowfall. The train is capable of plowing through the biggest drifts of snow, as it runs on a track which surrounds the globe, hitting all five major continents. The rationale for a train rather than a ship or anything else may be connected to the fact that the engine of the train is a perpetual motion machine. Unfortunately, the film never explains how that happens, but then, that is not important to the story.

The performance of Tilda Swindon in this film is worth the price of admission. She almost always plays quirky characters, and this is no different. The story becomes interesting as soon as she appears on the screen (however you may have a bit of trouble recognizing her.)The five other principle characters are good, and Ed Harris is especially good as a heavy who seems like he belongs as a heavy in an early James Bond movie.

Do not expect a lot of loud, fast special effects. the setting prevents grand battles with flying blood and mechanical arms. On the other hand, the good guy / bad guy interaction is carried out with lots of surprise and realism. Oh yes, I forgot. There is lots of blood.",1416182400,,2057,4.599455040871935

At its core Snowpiercer is a standard lower class uprising tale but its the unique train setting and the endless array of ideas it  utilizes in the ever-engaging plot which keep it from becoming another predictable Science-fiction/ Action blend.
The action scenes are well choreographed and entertaining but it is in the many moments of humanity in which this film soars.
Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris are fantastic as the upper class antagonists. Chris Evans is excellent in the lead and the rest of the cast does there best to make us forget that we've seen these characters a million times before in various other genre spectacles.
The cinematography is beautiful,  the interiors are gorgeously detailed and the exteriors are just as striking.
It's refreshing to see an action film like this that wants us to feel and think as much as be wowed by its dazzling stunts and effects. Most films forget the former in exchange for the latter.

6352702,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Comedian Daniel Tosh calls Snowpiercer, the worst movie he's ever seen. I however disagree, as it is both highly original and highly imaginative, but set in a very odd location. When global warming has become too much for the planet, top scientist create a cure, a new chemical that will stabilize the planet, however there is a miscalculation leading to a global ice age, which kills off most of the planet. Earth's remaining inhabitants are left stranded on a single luxury train that is forced to continually circle the earth. I understand that this train was a billionaires dream and has this state of the art engine that will last for decades, but why a train? I'd think if the world was ending, these people would put their money into an underground civilization or some super generator for the worlds largest building, because too me, a train doesn't make a whole lot of sense. When the engine fails, you're dead and if the ice causes a derailment or an avalanche crushes the tracks? There are so many things that could go wrong with this idea, that it's virtually impossible, that for 18 years, nothing has gone wrong. Captain America, Chris Evans stars and he is really terrific. I can't believe I never heard of this guy until a couple of years ago. He leads as if he's been doing it for years and Evans is assisted by a unique cast of characters, one stranger than the next, but their goal is all the same, to leave the crowded, filthy, back of the train, for the luxurious front. Every car brings with it new challenges and they must fight for their lives, before they can even worry about their freedom. The fact that this whole movie takes place on a train is intriguing and makes from some pretty unique scenes. Snowpiercer is one of the most imaginative films to come along in a long time and it features a huge cast of talented actors, that span multiple generations and ethnicities. To even my surprise I really enjoyed the film and couldn't wait to see what lay ahead in the next boxcar, but for as much as I liked the film, a thought kept gnawing in the back of my mind, why a train?",1416182400,3,2103,4.507853403141361
6352703,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer is a movie that I was excited to see. I first read about it a couple of years ago, and seeing the original poster for it had me eager to see how it was. Earths last remaining people, on a train going around in an endless circle because the whole planet had become uninhabitable for any forms of life. Everything was gone, covered in blankets of ice and snow, while you had a train that ran itself going making a full trip once a year, from one point to the other. For various reasons, the movie took a while to come out, and as soon as it popped up on instant video, I watched it immediately. While I was watching it, I loved the movie. I was in the world, and it moved at a very fast pace. There were no boring parts for the first hour and a half, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, and I had all kinds of ideas in my head as to how things were going to end. During the last 30 minutes, however, after a big reveal, the momentum died. I realized how dumb everything was. I started to ask questions. I started thinking about all the plot holes in the movie. I wondered why x event happened the way it did after the big reveal, which seemed like a really stupid waste of time for the characters. Sure enough, I go to check a message board for the movie, and people who watched the movie are in two camps- love it or hate it.

I just covered the basic background of the plot, but the movie focuses on a group of passengers who live in the back of the train. These are the lower class citizens, while the rich citizens live in the first couple of cars. If you're up there, you have access to real food, entertainment, music, everything youd expect at a grand hotel and spa. For those in the back, you give up your children now and then, eat nothing but mysterious protein blocks, and are punished if you ever question the authority of those in charge. One man learns this the hard way, after throwing a shoe at one of the elites, and is forced to sit with his right arm out one of the windows for several minutes. Needless to say, its frozen solid when his time is up, and its shattered with a hammer. But one man, Curtis, has been planning a revolution, and intends to reach the head of the train and make things right. He wants to take out the trains creator, Wilford, for making things the way they are on this train. Its going to be a long journey.

It felt weird going from really liking the movie to being against it near the end, so Ill go over what I liked here real quick. First, the actors and actresses were all spectacular. Chris Evans gives the best performance of his career as far as Im concerned, and Tilda Swinton plays a character that youll love to hate within minutes of walking into frame. Every actor delivers perfectly, especially in their physical actions and facial expressions. One of the elites, who loses his boyfriend to one of the passengers, says so much with his eyes without ever saying a word. Special recognition has to go to Kang-ho Song, who was also in Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance. This guy stole the show! The look of the sets and costumes really brings you into the world as well. What impressed me is something that was kind of strange- the lack of visible gore. There are -a lot- of violent fights and kills in the movie, and yet you rarely see the deaths actually happening. If someone gets stabbed, you see their reaction, not a close up of the wound. If someone gets shot, you see the aftermath, not the bullet shattering their forehead. Even a very would-be brutally bloody fight that should have been a complete massacre, given the circumstances, had very little blood. When was the last time you DIDNT see blood in a huge fight with pikes, axes, knives and clubs?

Now for the problem, which is essentially most of the plot. Again, you can totally enjoy this movie if you don't think about it at all. And Im not trying to dissect the plot, pointing out little things that don't make sense. No, they're pretty big points. Like why would the technology for something to sustain itself go into a train instead of, oh lets saya base somewhere on the planet? You have this train that they claim can never be stopped, yet whos out there to maintain the tracks? Why is there a whole car full of dudes in executioner masks just a few cars up from the lower class people? And don't you think that theyd be able to win a fight in the dark when every single one of them has, aside from superior weapons and strength, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES? What did it all for me was the big reveal towards the end. Theres actually two- one involving Cutis thats supposed to make us despise him, and one regarding the revolution he started to take over the train. Ill just say this- after we find out about what went on in the train during the first couple of months everyone was onboard, they sure do overreact when they find out what goes in those protein blocks. Everything up until this point wouldnt have bugged me so much if the last 30 minutes were better written. And the actual ending, just before the credits, good lordyou may as well have ended it with everything being a dream.

I noticed that a lot of people who praise Snowpiercer and claim its one of the best movies of all time (hoo boy) will say that anyone who didn't like it doesnt get it, as if its a deep intellectual movie that requires more than one viewing. All of the social commentary is obvious, without being annoyingly obvious like say, Land of the Dead. Metaphors aplenty don't make something great. Its a shame that this is the final product, because if someone would have gone in and edited the heck out of it, Snowpiercer could have been a lot more interesting and had more of an impact. Still, I recommend people watch Snowpiercer just to say that theyve seen it, and to know the full story for when fanboys start foaming out the mouth while praising it, oblivious to any criticism.",1416182400,13,5901,4.356948228882834

This is a so-so filmic adaption of a French novel. It has a deliberate but slow moving premise that does not coax you along, so much as drags you.
The story finds us in the year 2031.17 years earlier with global warming having reached a peak, world governments banded together to spray the atmosphere with a chemical designed to cool down the planet to more manageable levels. It of course didn't work and most of the planet when into a deep freeze. The last remaining inhabitants live on a long,long train which circles the globe as often as Earth circles the sun-once a year.
The train's inhabitants are split into two factions: the haves,which live the high life at the front of the train,and the have-nots,who occupy the back portion of it. It is this latter group that one day starts to slowly rise up against their suppressors from the front. The catalyst for the uprising(one of at least three others that have occurred since the train trip first started)is the taking away of some children for reasons unknown. The leader is Evans and his counsel is Hurt, who once worked up front. With the plan in motion the have-nots start their slow slog to the front,encountering all manner of opposition. The first guards they pass,even though they have weapons,cannot fire them as there are no bullets. They travel through a classroom,a hot house,a disco,encounter a car full of ""butchers"" and later guards WITH bullets. When they finally reach their destination Evans is greeted by the train master/inventor Harris. He explains why he has had to keep the population""controlled"" and Evans almost buys into it, until he finds that the mechanical system that maintains the train is now kept working by putting five year olds and under, down below.
At this same time one of Evans mates blows open a door of the train which has never been opened. Once done the noise starts an avalanche which ends up derailing the train and killing most of the inhabitants. Only a 17 year old and a five year old are left to their own devices walking away in the snow. The film ends with the children staring at a polar bear who is staring right back. Fresh meat...but for who?
The ending of the film is perplexing and pretty much a joke. To think the two young people survived their experiences only to be possibly eaten by a polar bear? It would have served the film better had it shown the children just cautiously walking away from the train,in awe of their surroundings.
Then there are other areas the film does not cover well,.if at all. One of the areas/train cars the have-nots travel through has an aquarium surrounding it in its walls. For the car to have that,it would have to be almost twice the size of a normal car,yet we only see a sleek long train with all cars equal in size....? There is also the matter of  a train that circumnavigates the world. They completely avoid the question of how the train travels over to two major oceans. The premise of any film,especially Sc-Fi,is that it must be rooted in some form of logic and reality,and this one,I'm sorry to say(or not), doesn't pass muster what so ever.
The acting is alright. Evans bears more than a passing resemblance to Jim Caviezel in looks and acting style. It is always a pleasure to see pros John Hurt and Ed Harris,but they are sadly wasted in this one.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary only.
All in all a big disappointment with  a so-so cast in a so-so story. The big names of Hurt and Harris are wasted,but the big ""hurt"",so to speak,is the plot holes that one can drive a semi through. 2 1/2 -3 stars.",1415491200,2,3779,4.6897590361445785

6352743,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"I was very intrigued as to why the reviews were so polarized on this film so I tried to view it with an open mind.  This film succeeds beautifully as an allegory of life. Despite the crazy train setup, it isn't science fiction at all.  It isn't even about the future.  It's about the human condition in life, the myriad ways humans find to destroy themselves, each other and the world to gain power or to protect what they have.  It's about the repetition throughout thousands of years of the same sickening methods of doing so. And yet it is all we have.  Like life, the train goes forward one way or the other.  Why are we here and why is it like this?  Who made it all?  Why does it all lead to death?  All of this is summed up in Curtis' eyes once he learns what is in the front car.  The knowledge is overwhelming.  The little bit of hope at the end was brilliant.  I'm definitely in the ""loved it"" camp.  This strikes me as the type of movie that eventually becomes a cult film.",1415491200,,984,4.170212765957447

That's what I think is the most important element of the story is that it was actually very realistic. You get lost in the plot not because you're transported to a fantasy world, but because the fantastic elements of this world make sense. I was especially fond of Curtis, played by Chris Evans. An anti-hero whose hesitation to lead is not revealed into the end. He's dark and tortured because he is in a dark and tortuous environment, and he's not a BS angst bunny.

Furthermore the inclusion of people from other cultures and who spoke languages other than English was an amazing element, that again, made it seem more realistic.

6352748,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"I loved this film. Yes, it can be strange and a bit daffy, sometimes in a ""Road Warrior"" sense and sometimes in a ""City of Lost Children"" sense. I have the feeling this is where it loses some western viewers, who tend to be disturbed when a film is not consistently deadly serious or consistently nutty, with no room for in-between. Also, this isn't hard sci-fi. It's fantasy/sci-fi, and like any fantasy it requires a willingness to suspend disbelief. Yes, a never-stopping global train is a crazy premise...""so be it"".

On top of some interesting action scenes, the film is entertaining in breadth of ways it can be interpreted. The train, while kind of a crazy and impractical concept (but if movies aren't the place for impracticality, what is?), is awesome in how it lends itself to those interpretations, which seems clear to have been the entire point. It's an obvious physical manifestation of the stratification of society. It can be seen as a reference to Dagny Taggart's railway in Atlas Shrugged, with the main villain being a John Galt stand-in, and the unwashed masses in the back of the train being what he sees (and Ayn Rand might see) as thankless moochers who should be happy to serve their purpose. The journey through the train is a zoo tour of humanity's shortcomings and willingness to bow to control (be it through indoctrination or comfort-driven apathy).

Top it off with an ending that may lead the viewer to question the propriety of pretty much everyone's ethics in the film, an you've got one of the most thought provoking films in years.

If, on the other hand, you only view films on a purely superficial level, looking only for scientific accuracy or cookie-cutter atmosphere, this isn't for you.",1415318400,,1728,4.811447811447811

6352752,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"If you are a filmmaker or you appreciate a film that is derivative of classic literature, history, and the class system, watch Snowpiercer!

The concept for Snowpiercer originated in a french graphic novel ""Le Transperceneige"" created in the early 80's - a time in history when the Cold War was beginning to thaw, liberty was taking over the world, and the concept of pollution was turning into a global cause.

Korean Director Bong Joon-ho (my new director hero)  stumbled on to an illegal Korean translation of Le_Transperceneige in a book store and he read it in its entirety once he cracked it open.

I've been extremely fortunate in my life to study films from around the world since my mother taught literature and film, and wrote a book on world cinema. Many of today's filmmakers will acknowledge influence by contemporary or modern greats such as the likes of Scorsese, Spielberg, Hitchcock, and Kurosawa, when they don't know any of the films that inspired these greats.

Within Snowpiercer, first and foremost, I see 1925's USSR film ""Battleship Potemkin,"" then Germany's 1927 incredible expressionistic film ""Metropolis,"" and then France's ""Germinal,"" first put to screen in 1913, with numerous remakes, including my favorite version from 1993 starring Grard Depardieu who's performance was brilliant.  There are other influences, particularly some German films from UFA in the 30's and 40's, and topping off with an ending that's typical of the French New Wave.

Snowpiercer presents poverty at its worst, a class system that is evil, and a time and place where industry has destroyed the world.  This movie is amazing and brilliant.  Not allowing this movie to have a wide release in the USA was a huge mistake, and the release company just had absolutely no idea or clue as to what they actually had.  This film will slowly circulate and people will see it, and its brilliance will be eventually be known.

If you ever have a chance, see the old films I mentioned.  You will be shocked as to how the themes and concepts of these films have survived in filmmaking today.",1415232000,,2084,4.939828080229226

6352755,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"I just watched Snowpiercer on On-Demand with my 2 adult sons.  The older one, an award-winning artist had read somewhere what an amazing movie this is and ""buzz"" about it online, whatever it was.  Within 5 minutes of watching this movie, we were not impressed.  By the end of the movie, we were awestruck how any intelligent person could love this movie, much less like it.  There are so many inconsistencies, plot holes, and just plain physical impossibilities as to require one not only to suspend disbelief and knowledge of 5th grade science but all sense of logic.

Please don't call this movie original.  Although many visuals and the cinematographic atmosphere were well done, this movie is a rehash of Mad Max, the Matrix, Alien, and all their rehashes, with a lot of Terry Gilliam plopped all over.  In fact, this looks like a rip-off of a Terry Gilliam movie that seems to want to amplify his worst excesses and indulgences.  Perhaps Hurt's character ""Gilliam"" is supposed to pay homage but it merely insults a much better director.

Please don't call this movie brilliant allegory.  Those that do obviously have never read a great allegory and probably don't read books period.  This is a dilettante's idea of a good allegory.  The themes of class warfare and Randian dystopia bleat like sheep and hit one over the head with brute force with no subtlety or depth.  This movie is simply pretentious to the point of condescension.

If you love overstated hammy acting, you'll love this movie.  There's some great actors in it including Hurt playing a character we've seen him play so many times it hurts, and Harris of the solemn, slow speaking, and still, piercing blue eyes.  His monologues sound profound, philosophical, and menacing.  The key word is ""sound"".  This is like the cartoon version of Social Darwinism relayed by a third-rate knock-off of a Charles Dickens villain.  The lead, Chris Evans, does a passable Keanu Reeves imitation for this movie and somehow manages even more woodenness.  I guess Keanu wasn't available...

When this piece of crap was over (don't get me started on the ending), I had to go check the reviews myself thinking my son must have read reviews for the wrong movie.  He hadn't.  Although regular people on Amazon and Rotten Tomatoes were highly critical, EVERY SINGLE professional review was positive.  That told me something was fishy.  I've seen this happen before, when some cause celebre takes over the cognoscenti and they delude themselves into groupthink and then lots of regular people follow that buzz.  In this case, I wondered if it was because of the current promotion of Korean cinema and the support of a seemingly powerful new director.  I couldn't believe that was it alone.  So I kept researching.  And I think I found the real reason.

It turns out that Harvey Weinstein (producer) demanded that the director edit parts of the movie (probably for the better) or he would restrict US distribution.  Bong not only refused but went public and to critics with his fight instigating formation of an ""independent"" group to protest this abominable censorship that no wanna-be Orson Welles would dare endure.  Poor brilliant artiste...  I'm sure many of these positive reviews are directly and indirectly derivative of this ersatz crusade.  I'm all for artistic freedom and integrity.  But that doesn't make this a good movie no matter how badly the professional critics want it to be.",1415232000,42,3443,4.928695652173913

This begs the question who is actually watching this film and giving it multiple stars? Is there a paid campaign to review it well? Such conspiratorial speculation has no place here, I know.  Forgive me.

Honestly, this is one of the most poorly conceived movies I have ever seen.  The plot is ludicrous and full of holes.  The characters are entirely devoid of, well, character.  The inconsistencies of the so-called closed environment of the train abound.  And what really bugged me was the pandering fashion in which the off-shore Directors and Producers relentlessly pounded in the awkward and inexplicable (plot-wise) mixture of Korean and Non-Korean headliners in contrast to other passenger's nationalities (again, speaking only plot-wise), in order to appeal to a wider audience.  For goodness sake, just make the entire film in Korea with Korean actors and let it stand on its own.  Films do this all the time.  Look at Troll Hunter.  Yes.  Troll Hunter.  A recent Norwegian film that didn't try to be an American movie and yet was well received in America - and elsewhere.  (Watch it, it's a fun movie that also deals with the absurd, but in a subtle tongue in cheek ""serious"" fashion that works well).

I won't dwell on the crazy inconsistencies that abound in Snow Piercer.  I could comment on how the train is always shaking and rattling in the exterior shots, but is always perfectly calm and still in the interiors -- except when the filmmakers decide to remind us that the train is plowing through ice flows, that is.  I could mention the fact that great and bloody conflicts abound, and yet nobody is screaming in agony and pain during or after the violent activities.  Sure, there is some yelling and some cross dialog during the scenes.  But there is a surprising lack of, ""Hey, you just chopped off my arm, I can't stop screaming because it smarts so badly!"".  It's all surprisingly calm and peaceful for bloody carnage.  I could ask where the grasshoppers are raised and what they are fed.  I could ask the question of how the water in the hot tubs stays so calm and placid on a moving train.  I could even question how the lead character's beard stays so closely cropped and well maintained in an environment where everybody else in the rear of the train betrays the cleanliness and grooming of extras from Mad Max.

I could mention those things and so many, many more (like why don't people just live in buildings.  Why must they be on the train?).  But I won't.  I will not dwell on the crazily large number of issues that this film has.  Let others elaborate on such things.

A prime tenant of good filmmaking is to create a suspension of disbelief with the audience.  This film is the anti-tenant.

6352781,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"I've seen (or read) this sort of thing before. The set-up is you have an oppressive, dystopian society where a hero plans to rise up turn things around. But all is not as it seems.

Here's the scoop. Global warming has begun to fry the earth. A drastic undertaking by various countries has turned things around too well, rendering the earth one big ice cube. An ecologically balanced train races across the globe with the elite folk in the forward cars and the poor folk in the rear cars. Curtis (Chris Evans) leads a rebellion to mow his way through the train to the front cars and take over. What wild journey it becomes.

There is so much to like about this film but so much that left me scratching my head. Luckily, the good outweighed the bad for me. Joon-ho Bong directed this and I've seen three of his other films which I've liked very much. Here, the directing is very good but I didn't believe some of the story elements. When the rebels make it to one particular car, containing a bunch of soldiers, the film should have ended there. No way were these guys going to hack their way through that crowd. I also did not believe the ""psychic."" It was too convenient. And the final shot? No way. But on the good side was the surreal quality to it. Tilda Swinton's character has to be seen to be believed. I thought she was brilliant in the most odd of ways. The design of the train was odd as well. It looked like an exercise in Art Deco of the future.

The performances as a whole were very good. Some of the effects were suspect but the overall production quality was very good. The music score was Okay. At times good, at times a bit overbearing.

The four stars I gave it is a bit generous but had I given it only three it might put off some from seeing it and this deserves a wide audience.",1414886400,,1800,4.285294117647059

6352802,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"This movie, by Korean director Bong Joon-ho is worth watching because even though the science fiction may be flawed (e.g. what exactly powers the perpetual engine of the Snowpiercer train is never revealed) but presents one view of how humanity might reorganize itself if it had to start over.  While the initial answer seems to be pretty grim--whoever scrambles first to become the ""haves"" must feel it has triumphed only if it first can create a group of ""have-nots"" who must suffer every indignity and humiliation.  It does end on at least a more hopeful note--nature and life have surprising resiliency.  At times, especially towards the beginning, the film can be a bit difficult to watch, especially for the squeamish; but there are many twists and turns that will keep your stomach churning until the inevitable conclusion when the front of the Snowpiercer is reached by the rebels. The cast has some very well-know and accomplished actors and they offer great performances--Tilda Swinton, for one example, is a hoot! This is not a movie for the millions who pay to see films like the Transformer series where giant robots slug it out for who-knows-why reasons, but rather it will make you think about why our society is organized the way it is and are concepts like justice and fairness and humanity part of our true human nature or unreachable, and therefore mere platitudes whose only purpose is to keep us from killing one another.  It is not light fare, and it won't cheer you up if that's the kind of movie for which you are looking, but it will make you wonder about what it is that makes us human.",1414540800,,1612,4.746428571428571

The Holocaust was definitely brought to mind, but these prisoners had the choice to FIGHT BACK..(or forward)  Because they were the ""tail"" of the train they had to take the ENGINE, and that was going to be a long bloody battle.  Those who complain about the train setting being pointless, well, yeah, but let that sink in a little deeper.  I found it to be very thought provoking and the CAST was outstanding...

This movie has heart and soul and is a very interesting look at the human condition form a country that has seen the true face of humanity. Snowpiercer is just another nail in the coffin of Hollywood's waning dominance. For many years now if you want clich dialogue, corny catch phrases galore, and mindless action with tons of plot holes, Hollywood's movies and TV are for you. However if you want smart, well written, executed, and conceived entertainment you have to go else ware. Hollywood has created incredible technology for making entertainment, but in the process they have allowed the technology and sales to become more important that the story.

The dialog is largely eye-rolling, and occasionally downright stupid.

When I ask myself, what could possibly have been the motivation for this movie, all I can come up with is shock effect. The plot is totally irrational. For example, there are eggs on the train, but no chickens; steaks, but no steers; bugs, but no source for them. What do they plan on doing if the snow ever melts? There are no animals on the train to repopulate the earth. Only fish. It is mindless storytelling. Granted, some of the visuals are stunning; but stunning visuals do not a movie make.

In addition, the characters are poorly developed so that we really don't care what happens to them. Good thing, because it isn't pretty. I kept hoping that by the time we got to the front of the train, something good would happen that would justify all the bad things that happen before. It doesn't. Again, poor storytelling.

Five of us were on a fishing trip and decided to watch this at the end of a day of being out in nature. Bad decision. All the beauty and enjoyment of the day were wiped out in two hours by this piece of self-indulgent filmmaking. We all regretted seeing it. Only thing I can figure by the ratings is that this film has spent most of its time in NY and LA and is just now making it to the Heartland. I predict the ratings will come down as more and more Middle Americans see it. Either that or Americans really have lost their minds, and this piece of insanity speaks to them.

6352838,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Different, tense, set in a futuristic dystopian micro-society-aboard-a-train movie. Chris Evans stars as main-character, Curtis, who has spent 17 years on Earth, before the man-created atmospheric apocalypse and 17 years aboard Snowpiercer - a train that was designed with an engine that would last forever & had a sufficient number of cars designated to providing housing, water & food to sustain life. The world is frozen, cannot sustain life & anyone who is outside the confines of the train freezes to death.

Curtis' cohort is train-born Edgar (Jamie Bell), who doesn't know what he is missing (from living on the old Earth). The only thing that Curtis & Edgar know is that living in the ""rear"" part of Snowpiercer is less than tolerable with gel bricks for food, no privacy, & a sardine-like existence without windows. The guards keep military-grade order after a failed uprising several years before.

The mission of Curtis & Edgar is to revolt & make their way (along with any rear-of-the-train people) to the front, where they suspect people are privileged. Train-born children are periodically taken away by force for unknown reasons, people are punished for violence toward upper echelon ruling class people by having an arm stuck out a hole in the side of the train until it is frozen solid and then it is sledge-hammered to smithereens.

The person in charge of the train & its engine is Wilford (Ed Harris). Curtis hates Wilford & is determined to make his way through every car on the train until he reaches Wilford. He breaks out a prisoner (Kang-ho Song) who designed the gates on the train to help him unlock them on his way to the front.

This movie is gritty, gory, bloody and filled with angst. I didn't recognize Chris Evans with his dark beard & hair & his somber, terse demeanor. The movie is worth watching to the end since reasons for every oddity or motive are revealed as the movie progresses. I was surprised at how it all fit together in a way that was unexpected. As with most futuristic movies, some aspects in the movie (like slaughtered chickens and sides of beef suspended in one car) are not plausible & not explained.

I am all about watching a different kind of sci-fi movie and this movie's premise and trailer interested me enough to make me watch.  It had flashes of similarities to a similar story line of ""Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"" yet had a unique enough premise to draw me into it to watch.

Unfortunately this movie fails to live up to what it promises.  I can get past the whole train setting as kind of nonsensical in the first place but this movie the script itself wanders off the track too many times that it derailed to me early on.  Sometimes books don't translate well into movies and although maybe my lack of familiarity with this story makes it a difficult translation to me, I don't know.  I would just hope that the book has a more cohesive story that what the movie showed.  It is almost that the movie tries too hard to stray out into weirdness territory just to be different.  The basic story is there and underneath the layers it has a lot of potential to be good, but the strange action sequences, weird dialogue and shaky camera shot sequences just left me more annoyed than amused.

This is going to be a movie that some people are going to like for sure with its off center storyline and overall strange feel. It has its messages that it is trying to send, but like the translator in the movie, it didn't get the message very clear to me. I will give it credit for being original and different as for sure that is it what it was.  If you are looking for something out of the norm of the standard type sci-fi then this you may enjoy.  For me, this isn't a terrible film as movie starts to get interesting toward the end but the movie is really hard for me to rate as there were so many things, especially early on that made me dislike the film.",1414195200,4,1996,4.367567567567567

But by midsummer it hadn't moved out of the art houses in my town into the multiplexes. Now I understand why. Though it has some of the trappings of a blockbuster, it's actually an art-house dystopian sf tale. It never belonged in the multiplex. I finally just saw the Blu Ray and, while not blown away, came away respecting the film immensely. It is, of course, a vivid metaphor for where human civilization is heading: There's one powerful guy left standing in a blighted arctic landscape, together with a few of his friends, the goons who guard him, minions for labor, and the dirty, starving, unwashed remnants of the middle class and the poor. Only it all takes place on a zooming train.

And no, that's not a ""spoiler"" because you're told that in the first 2 min of the movie.  To enjoy Snowpiercer, you have to suspend all plausibility and your knowledge of physics and simply sit back and enjoy the carnage.  If you spend your time trying to make sense of the many things in this movie that don't make sense, well...you might as well watch a different movie.

Chris Evans was just fantastic!  I read where he's going to retire from acting once his 6th Capt America/Avengers movie is completed.  That's a shame cause dude can flat out act!  He makes it easy to join in and pull for the ""shoes"" to succeed in their struggle.  I'd give this flick 5 stars just for Evans...A truly remarkable performance!

If you don't like blood & guts, then you're going to be turning your head quite a bit in this one.  We were completely unprepared for the level of violence reached in Snowpiercer.  But it is a graphic representation of how mind-numbingly brutal human beings can be to each other.  Human brutality knows no bounds...

This movie should be required material for all Global Warming Tree-Huggers out there who are foolish enough to believe that mankind could ever do something as inconceivable as control the weather on a planet that was engineered to be quite capable of taking care of itself despite anything man (or cow farts) can throw at it, thank you very much.  Although considering how gullible the masses have proven themselves to be, it wouldn't surprise me if we entered another ice age just as our misguided leaders try to convince us that runaway planetary heat is the problem, regardless of what the facts state.

6352853,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer is clearly brilliant, though also weird, and fascinatingly and effectively international, which is a very nice twist. I'm pretty sure it's meant as an allegory of the class system and the corresponding obstacles to mobility between classes (as represented all too transparently by sections of the train). It's also meant to have the feel of a graphic novel, and it easily pulls that off... you could think of many scenes also as ""panels."" Now, you might ask, what does a train that never stops moving have to do with the environmental apocalypse? Well, it's a thin line of reasoning, but the idea is that the train was set up by a visionary as a self-contained, sustainable ecosystem, and... he just happened also to like trains that travel all the way around the world once a year (without track maintenance staff?). Yeah. You can ONLY read it as an allegory. But the acting and character development is outstanding, as are the visuals, the pacing, etc. It's also nice to see the work by a Korean director with quite a few Korean actors. And while Snowpiercer's analysis of the class system is spotty at best (Marx for kindergartners, maybe?), the allegorical emphasis on obstacles to mobility is worth giving further thought to. Finally, there is an ending worthy of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is in fact an allegory in the same vein (no, I'm not kidding!). So, should you see it? Well, if it sounds interesting, based on what I just wrote, then yeah, go ahead! It's easily one of the most interesting science fiction ideas out there right now, and it escapes the narrow formulas that ensnare the majority of cinematic efforts at science fiction (film has not done well by science fiction, in balance, in fact, television has done much, much better).

MTV and Variety said this film was ""visually stunning"" and a ""masterpiece of science fiction"".  I found it to be visually tedious and claustrophobic, with the entire film taking place in the dark confines of the cars of a really long train.

  There were so many implausible absurdities in building this metaphor of class struggle that it quickly becomes silly.  The idea of a trillionaire eccentric building a globe-encompassing railroad with a magic engine that needs no fuel is just one absurdity.  A thousand survivors of an extinction event aren't explained; who are they, why them, how were they picked for the magic train?  The bizarre need for the conscription of children under 5 to grease the engine of the magic locomotive isn't explained.  After all, if it is magic, then why does the engine need to be greased?  And by 5 year olds?  The voluntary self-mutilation (cutting off of one's arms and legs) to feed the starving poor is a ridiculous presentation of 'costing an arm and a leg'.  All the arms and legs of all the poor would have fed them for a couple of weeks, and then what?  The protein bars later fed to the poor are made up of millions of cockroaches and other vermin, whose presence on the train is never explained.  Who herds and catches the millions of cockroaches needed for a daily dose of protein bars? The availability of a never-ending supply of cattle and chickens (food for the few rich) is also not explained, as the world outside the train is in a permanent, sub-zero instant freezing state, and there is certainly no grazing room on the train.  So where did the cockroaches, chickens, and cattle come from, if the world has been frozen sub-zero solid for 17 years?

  Despite a very few glimpses of the outside world from within the train, the movie gives the sense of being filmed in someone's basement.  And the plot line of the struggle of yet another self-doubting, reluctant hero trying to overcome his failures is rather old.  Hero Curtis hates himself because, as we discover at the end of this long journey to nowhere, years earlier he was unable to cut off his own arm to help feed the masses, and he therefore considers himself a failure.

  Spoiler alert ....

  This is another pretentious film where, twenty minutes into it, you find yourself looking at your watch to see how much time is left.  The film actually becomes interesting in the very last scenes, after the train has crashed and all have died except the Korean girl Yona and the boy Timmy, who venture out into the frozen air to find that there is still life in the world ( a polar bear watching from a nearby ridge), and they just might survive.

It has a really stupid concept but a lot of people told me it was good, so I ordered it. I wanted to see if the writers could make the concept work or at least make us forget about it.
Well yes, the concept is stupid. Unfortunately so is the rest of the movie.
It is a mishmash of cliche's stuck together and then nailed against a bad initial idea.
It has real problems aside from that, These problems range from figuring out whether the message is the 'The human species is killing itself by over populating the world"" or ""Think of the children!"" (it tries to run to opposed messages).
Then there is the problem that none of the people behave like people. We have a long history of revolutions, we know how people in then tend to act. Not in this film. Most of the characters do not act like people would in the situations this movie presents. They are terribly written for drama purposes. If you want emotional triggers and will put up with any kind of writing to get them? This movie may be for you!
Of course the scene where a man gives up something he would never give up.. only to have the writers make it materialize back where it started, when they need him to it again.
I could go on and on and on but I'm being as vague as possible. For more it would be spoilers and no one likes those.

The final survivors board the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe via a perpetual-motion engine.

The screen story by Bong & the screenplay by Bong & Kelly Masterson (both of which based on Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand & Jean-Marc Rochette) is brilliant.

The music by Marco Beltrami is brilliant. The cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is brilliant. The film editing by Steve M. Choe & Changju Kim is brilliant. The casting by Johanna Ray & Jenny Jue is brilliant. The production design by Ondrej Nekvasil is brilliant. The art direction by Stefan Kovacik is brilliant.

6352914,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer stars Chis Evans as Curtis who exists with the last handful of humanity left alive after a failed experiment to reverse Earths rising climate resulted in another ice age. The only survivors are those who boarded a bullet train that was designed by an enigmatic billionaire named Wilford (Ed Harris) to perpetually cycle the earth in annual rotations with no need for fuel. Curtis is a Freeloader. Freeloaders are the poor who are permitted to board the train but are relegated to the tail-end of the train and live in deplorable conditions. The train features a second and first class passage for those wealthy enough to afford the tickets, each with far more luxurious accommodations.

Unsurprisingly, the Freeloaders get fed up with their position in the train and the conditions that they are forced to live with such as the mysterious gelatinous Protein bars that are their sole food supply. As the film progresses, director Joon-Ho Bong (The Host, the Korean monster one, not the lame Saoirse Ronan one) slowly reveals exactly what the Freeloaders have had to do and live with in order to survive in their compartments. Curtis with the help of an aging leader named Gillian (John Hurt) stage a rebellion that will take them through the entire length of the train with the goal of reaching and taking control of the sacred engine car. This fight to the front is the main action of the movie, and it is really exciting. Every car is wildly different with new and interesting experiences for the characters that keep the movie fresh and engaging.

Snowpiercer is a witty and enjoyable allegory about class warfare and the dangers of totalitarianism. Directed by a South Korean, it is hard to not see this film as a somewhat veiled criticism on the state of North Korea. Political and allegorical messages aside, Snowpiercer is a solid, intelligent summer action film with great performances. Tilda Swinton may give the first Oscar-worthy performance of 2014 as the deliciously evil Minister Mason who combats Curtis and his army in the most sly and conniving of ways. Snowpiercer easily could be labeled the best film of the summer, 2014 . A-",1412726400,3,2156,4.904109589041096

6352931,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"I suspect the large amount of 5 stars and 1 star ratings has more to do with the movies' politics than anything.  If you believe life comes down to ""takers versus makers"" you will not like this movie.  If you have ever pondered over the craziness of a world a few billionaires compete for the worlds biggest yacht while thousands of people die of Ebola, then you will probably like the movie.

Putting politics aside, I think the movie stands on its own as a well-shot, super violent, action movie.  Some people have commented on the ""absurd"" premise.  Obviously ""everybody get on a train"" is not a realistic post-apocalyptic scenario and isn't meant to be.  The train just establishes the arbitrary class distinctions and limitations that drive the plot.  Again, even if you don't think class distinctions are arbitrary, you should be able to put that aside when watching the movie.  The allegory of the movie may be correct or incorrect, but it is pretty clear what it is saying and, within the confines of the crazy premise, it all makes sense.  Lower classes go here, food goes here, law enforcement goes here, religion goes here, drugs go here, the education system goes here, and so on.  Even if you completely reject the allegory, it does pose some challenges worth contemplating.  And, if you buy the allegory, then the movie poses the question of the difficulty of changing the situation (haven't all revolutions ended the same way?)  So 1.  I founded entertaining, putting aside the thought behind the move  2.  As far as movies go, it's about as thoughtful as you can get with an allegory of the entire world in about 2 hours.",1412208000,7,1637,4.714788732394366

The train and humanity overall has created a caste system in which those born in the cars nearest the engine are the richest and most privileged.  Those born in the back of the train are born into poverty and struggle to survive on rations.
After seventeen years, those in the rear have decided to revolt against those in the front.  Those that control the engine, control the remains of the world.",1412121600,2,706,4.661290322580645

But whatever downloaded to my laptop was about as viewable as if I had been streaming it from some illegal Bulgarian pirate site. For one thing, the scenes that were dark (i.e, the entire first third of the movie) were so dark as to be completely illegible. Second, the action scenes downloaded so poorly and blurrily that they looked more like an Impressionism survey than an action movie. (I had to watch them twice and still couldn't understand what happened.) Tilda Swinton is pretty good; she gets a good character and good fake teeth to work with -- poor Chris Evans doesn't get to do much but look tough and determined, and he doesn't even take off his shirt once (or maybe he did it in one of the unwatchably dark scene, but I think they woulda taken care to light that one up).

They are such a threat to the rest of the passengers that they must be watched by militia 24/7.

Also, it is ultra violent. There's one scene that borders on horror. The story is so flimsy it is almost a poor excuse for all the violence and cruelty.

The setting is grim and dramatic, but some of the characters come across like caricatures. And after what everything the main characters had suffered through, the ending seems vague & unjustified.

The lucky ones to make it out before the freeze still live on a train called the Snowpiercer. The train is on a constant loop around the world and has it's own class system and is self sustaining. After years of being oppressed the group from the back of the train begin a revolt to make everything more fair. Curtis (Evans) leads the revolution. This is an idea that has been done many many times before, A group of oppressed citizens rebel against the wealthy. While the movie was basically OK you can only do the same idea so many times before it loses the impact it wants. My biggest problem with this movie is that it starts in the middle and you are trying to play catch up as to what is going on for the entire time. Even a little blurb in the beginning that you had to read to get the back story would have been good. Halfway through you get a history lesson but up until that point you feel lost and that hurts the movie in the way that you can't really get connected to the characters or the movie from the beginning. Other than that though the movie isn't terrible and sci-fi fans will like it but for me it was just too slow moving and never really settled into what it wanted to be for me to fully get invested in. Overall, not bad but the fact that it seemed to start in the middle made it hard to get involved with. I give it a low B-.",1410739200,,1578,4.211221122112211

6353078,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"Terribly disappointing. The actual storyline is unique and the writers could have done amazing things with the script: unfortunately, this film missed the mark for me. The movie follows ""humanity"" 17 years after an apocalyptic Earthly demise and the few survivors of the ice storm have gathered to live on this never-ending/stopping train.  The train passengers are herded into social classes with those in the caboose (referenced as ""tail"" in the film) representing the lower classes and those in cars closest to the engine represent the wealthy. The poorer passengers are led by Curtis (Chris Evans) to revolt due to poor treatment, bland food selections and compact living quarters. Essentially, it is 120 minutes of us following Curtis moving from car-to-car in an attempt to reach the engine and the omniscient Wilford (the man who invented/built the train, and the one who gives orders to everyone else). I thought it was a great opportunity to highlight the innate need for humans to split and diverge into groups based on similar interests/characteristics/capabilities. The acting, IMHO, was subpar and there were parts of the film that seemed to drag on. I did, however, appreciate that this seems to be the first action movie I've seen in a long time where the main male lead's journey doesn't seem to be wrapped up in a supporting female love-interest. Overall, the film was visually pleasant, the special effects and action scenes were enthralling and  the concept was original. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this===I definitely won't be adding it to my collection, but a one-time rental on a rainy day may not be such a bad idea.",1410048000,2,1644,5.040441176470588

Ok, I shouldn't have expected so much and I wouldn't have been disappointed at all. It was an intriguing premise -- all of humanity crammed into one train.  All the world's poor in the back, with no power. Each car on the way to the Engine with progressively more powerful and wealthy people (ah, if only more interaction occurred between the poor invaders, and these other car folks).

I digress, the scenery was darkly beautiful and matched the tone, and, the acting was good. The action kept me watching, there really were no dull moments.

This movie does leave a lot of work to the viewers imagination, and does not attempt to give you clear cut answers to all questions, but that is how metaphors work and that is what makes it great. It's focused, well paced and well directed. Visuals create great atmosphere, suited to the story and every action sequence is refreshingly serving not only to move the story forward to establish one more facet of character development and the overall world we have been thrown directly in. Rare fit in recent history of cinema.

The only problem I have with this movie is Chris Evans. And not because of the performance. That was amazing. But, they might have needed someone looking more like Steve Rogers pre-enhancment, and they got full on Captain America. Can't hide that under the coat and facial hair. Yet, he does manage.

The characters defeated one boss and then struggled to get a door open just to reveal a more difficult boss... and this went on and on.

6353126,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"My friend got this movie and I am very thankful I didn't buy or even rent this myself!  In fact, I'm writing this review as a public service announcement.
First of all... if you like artsy fartsy fancy movie directing (think Citizen Kane) than you might like this movie.  If you are fanboy of the comic and actually know what the heck is going on you might like this movie.  For the rest of us this is a absolute horrible stank burger of a movie that couldn't end quick enough... and unfortunately it's ungodly long.
The idea that all that is left of humanity was saved by a train and not a bunker is just stupid.  The fact that a train ran on a track for 18 years straight with never needing maintenance EVER, is stupid.  This movie is so far from believable it should not even be put remotely close to sci-fi.  I'm saying Star Wars's Force is more of a believable possibility than anything in this movie. I find Mike Myers's Cat In The Hat movie more believable than this movie.  I want to state that a few of you after reading the description might think that the nay sayers are politically motivated.  I really don't believe this movie really had any political motivations.  If it did, it totally failed at it.  I can disagree with politics of a movie and still get the plot and their perspective. This movie is 100% purely just nonsensical like someone tried to make Charlie and the Chocolate Factory into a drama.  Which best describes this film.
It would have been really nice if the director didn't have such a hatred for the viewers and put subtitles on key story point reveals that are being told in Korean.  I am not kidding.
I love anime and manga action cartoons... but some of the action scenes don't just break the laws of physics ... they break the laws of Wile E. Coyote physics and forget about anything of common sense.
I found none of the characters in this movie remotely likable, except for the black woman.  Everyone else including the star of the movie your hoping their character gets a torturous gruesome death.
This is about the worst movie I have ever seen.  This is coming from a guy who appreciates some pretty artsy films, loves brainless action flicks and searches out for the worst B flicks for a little MST3k style entertainment.  Both me and my friend were so stunned by the high quality of camera work with the high volume of stupid, that we couldn't even begin to make a MST3k style quip about the movie.  Like imagine if Spielberg directed a remake of ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" with a 40 million dollar production budget.  After watching this... who knows maybe George Lucas will agree to direct and remake Barbarella.  This movie made me doubt reality and humanity.
But seriously though! All the camera work was absolutely masterfully done, and everything else (script being the worst) was a train wreck.  Pun intended.",1409529600,9,2864,4.569471624266145
6353127,4,B00JBBJJ4C,Great movie !  Worth the price of admission.,1409529600,,44,4.5
6353128,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"I came into this movie expecting to like it. Instead, I came out disgusted, frustrated and incensed. Here are some key points that stuck in my mind after watching:

Symbolism was heavy handed--to the point of absurdity. The number of rooms needed to point out that the upper class were wealthy and spoiled seemed ludicrous. A hair salon? Really?

Poorly written dialogue that managed to both stereotype and trivialize potentially interesting characters. Especially Tanya, who was a ""sassy black mother"" whose main role in the movie was to provide a platform for her son's tragedy to shine. Another example: Andrew, a snarky Scotsman, with few lines that genuinely developed his character beyond the stereotype of ""snarky Scotsman"".

Heavy handed sexism. Of the three notable female characters, the one who played the most prominent role (as in, most screen time), Mason, was shown to have absolutely no redeemable characteristics. This, in and of itself, is fine, but the amount of humiliation and vengeance that was delivered her way points to a sexist ""putting you in your place"" mentality. (Ironic, considering that one point of the movie was to question prescribed societal roles) This is indicated by the fact that even the male characters who were much more ""evil"" than she was (i.e. Wilford, as well as that big, pugnacious, dude with the gun that just. wouldn't. die.) received much less backlash and vitriol. There seemed to be a special delight taken on part of the director in humiliating this character and singling her out for disgrace. To be honest, I almost stopped watching the movie after seeing her chained and lead around the train as if she were a dog (or slave) and all the other characters seeming to take delight in keeping her powerless.

The sexism in this movie does not stop there, however. Of the lower class rebels shown fighting for control of the train only TWO of them were women. As they progress further to the front of the train, background actresses increase in number, implying that the higher class (read:vain, insipid, mindless oppressors) are mostly women, while the poor, beleaguered, white men live in the slums. This is particularly offensive considering the historical role that women have had in our society. If you pay attention to the role of women in this movie, you could argue that the point of the movie was not about taking power away from the rich dictators, but rather about taking power away from women (and rejoicing in it).

A third point: about 75% of this movie was pointless fighting. Explosions as a plot device, both figuratively and literally, was a major theme throughout this movie. This is fine if you don't care about things like plot and characterization.

All in all, I recommend this movie only as a sad commentary on the state of our society. It shows that people are still willing to overlook blatant sexism while reveling in a story about rebellion against unfair class structures.

The hypocrisy is astounding.",1409443200,3,2984,4.944111776447106

6353130,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"When you get down to it, it's a fairly typical dystopian future film, though there are a few mild surprises.  A lot of action that's fairly routine, but the special effects are well done.  Loved the ending though, very hopeful yet a little frightening, too",1409443200,,256,4.666666666666667
6353131,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"This is not just another dead-brain action flick. You're actually going to have to think a little with themes on consequences to your environment, leadership vs power, class systems and human cruelty. The protaganist is not a hero in the making, and he's not an anti-hero either. Like others have mentioned, you have to accept the premise before moving on with the film: a train full of humanity's last survivors packed into socially divided cars that perpetually travels the icy wasteland that is now the globe. The premise will give you an eyebrow raised in skepticism initially, but the situation of the world soon becomes moot as you become invested in the state of life on the train, especially for the protagonists who occupy the tail section i.e. the slums.

It's a unique film, certainly not the same old fair. The storytellers do a good job of giving you just enough detail to connect the dots, but not so much that you start to pull apart the plot element as stupid or unbelievable.

The antagonists seem wholly cruel, but you can appreciate where they might be coming from and not disbelieve that humans could treat each other so badly, or, in some cases, so bizarrely. So yes, it's violent, but not gushingly bloody. Yes, it's intense, but there's just enough kooky moments to get some levity. I can say I'm rather impressed with Chris Evens' performance. His voice is lower and darker and the faces with hidden meaning he lets show for reasons that are revealed at the end were curious in the moment and striking in review.

Richly detailed. Reminded me a bit of films by Jeunet. Every actor has a special ""thing"" going on for their part, and that's especially fulfilling to me. I feel like noting that this is based on a graphic novel and has a serious, grim tone despite the action and flourishes. It's definitely in my favorite top picks of the year thus far.

Honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. I see NO reason why it's rated so high (see Rotten Tomatoes, MetaCritic, etc.) It's like we didn't even see the same movie.

Ridiculous characters, plot twists, fight scenes, and storyline in general. So much goes unexplained; although this may be because there are no logical answers to all the questions you are left with after watching this film.

I could go on for hours ranting about how terrible this movie was. But my biggest question is, why are there not more people upset about how overrated (literally) and absurd this movie is?

So bad on so many levels, yet so highly rated by sites and critics I used to trust. How? Why? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

I love a good dystopian science fiction movie, and this wasn't it.

Now, I'm sure that the book was better than the movie (although I'll not read the book now) but there were so many holes in this thing that my wife and I just got distracted. Maybe the following are answered in the book but I don't really want to know now. I may have spoilers below but this movie spoiled itself in front of me.

- What real value do the tail car people provide? I didn't see them doing any work. Why bother bring them on board at all? Feeding them was just an after thought.
- Why do the police thugs need to wear masks? Who cares who they are?
- Hey, let's attack straight through to the front of the train! But, let's stop for sleepy-time, sushi, and a silly kids' movie.
- Love the aquarium, makes sense. I get that sushi makes sense for the front car guys. Just don't hold up your assault for it.
- Hanging meat, check. Cattle car? Ok, I accept that you don't have to show me every car.
- A room for reading? OK. A room for custom tailored clothes? A stretch. A car dedicated to a hair salon? Too far.
- A single sauna? OK. A car dedicated to sauna? Rave car? Swimming hole car? Um, what???
- When you get stabbed in the leg, you need surgery. You don't want to walk on it with no limp.
- Too many people pretending to be dead and then getting up to fight the good fight. Knife wounds kill and injure, not put you to sleep.

Also included a nice dig at the enviro-whackos, which is rare for Hollywood, and may explain why it this film was so under-appreciated.

6353180,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"A single train, an ark, traverses a post-apocalyptic, frozen landscape.  Humanity has been divided in a pseudo caste system to maintain 'order'.  Chris Evans' character, an occupant of the rear car, leads a revolution to bring 'justice' for his people.  The way to achieve this is to fight through the train cars to the engine where you can gain control of all of humanity.

The story is engaging, or at least it was for myself, not your typical dumb action movie.  It proved to be, at times, thought provoking.  Solid acting throughout, nothing should stand out as blatantly awful.  There was some over-acting at times, but such things are to be expected with these types of films.

I would like to say that the deaths in this movie, villains and friends alike, lacked depth.  You didn't feel especially sad or gratified to see either parties bite the big one.  It's possible this was by design, but it lacked an emotional punch for me. The ending left me with a similar feeling.  You get to it and it just kind of 'is'.

 Fight scenes were a tad bit bland, think they missed out on some opportunities for some really epic scenes.  A particular scene from the Korean classic 'Old Boy' would have been perfect for a film like this.  Maybe some 'The Raid'-esque choreography even.  I know they likely wanted to give the story more weight and may have felt adding too much action would take away from that, but I personally believe it would have only helped.  With that said, they still proved to be entertaining enough to keep your attention.

All in all, I enjoyed this film with it's mix of violence, surreal scenes, and somewhat unexpected twists compelled me to give it a 4-star rating.  My actual rating would be closer to 3.6, 3.7.",1408838400,,1736,4.61437908496732

6353212,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"Let me say right off that I'm a huge fan of dystopian sci-fi films, especially Blade Runner & Brazil & Code 46. In addition, Host & Mother, directed previously by Joon Bong-Ho, are two of my favorite films of recent years. I was really looking forward seeing this movie, even going so far as to paying full price for the Amazon Prime Instant Video.

That said, how to start cataloging the letdowns. First, the story, which is as linear as the train it takes place on. Some people claim the movie is a parable which I'd be more than ready to embrace if it were even remotely true, but in truth the story line is a simplistic, almost juvenile treatise on the evils of the powerful vs. the weak, predicable as to both plot & characters. None of the characters really stand out as much more than 2-dimensional cartoon characters, which might have worked if the film were animated, but the acting, especially among English-speaking ones, is stilted & forced. After viewing Host (2 of whose leads appear in this, again as father & daughter) & Mother, as well as other Asian films, I've pretty much concluded that English-speaking actors, particularly American ones, do not fare well in over-the-top films like this, apparently being unable to convey the powerful facial expressions of their emotionally less-restrained Asian counterparts & compensating with overly theatrical readings of their lines. John Hurt is the exception: he's lucky to have that finely engraved face, but drones on wearily as he has in most films since Alien. Tilda Swinton is funny but looks & acts like she's in a totally different movie, maybe Monty Python knockoff.

One major character named Gilliam & several vaguely retro futuristic sets suggest this is a minor homage to Terry Gilliam's Brazil, in which case maybe it should have been called Bengladesh.",1408492800,6,1829,4.877813504823151

6353219,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"'Snowpiercer' is the best SF action film I've seen this year. It's a thoughtful examination of class distinction and exploitation, an exciting addition to the 'survival horror' sub-genre of SF that includes 'The Road', 'The Walking Dead', 'The Mist', 'Sunshine', 'Lost', 'The Last Ship', 'Pandorum', 'Last Days on Mars', et cetera. It's also a sometimes comical story about a proverbial tempest in a teacup... or a typhoon in a train-car. Based on a French comic, adapted by South Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho, and starring American, British and Korean leads, 'Snowpiercer' is a thoroughly global production.

It's 2034 and the world is one frozen nightmare in the grips of an endless winter, an ice-age caused by a cataclysmic malfunction in a technology meant to combat global warming. A huge train, apparently powered by a perpetual-motion engine, is like a bullet as big as Hadrian's Wall, a juggernaut built to plow through anything that happens to be piled onto the tracks -- usually snow, hence the title. It is the unlikely sanctuary for a hard-luck remnant of the human race. Due to severe limitations on space, food, and energy, a harsh class system exists in this rolling city that is miles long but less than 20 feet wide.

The people in the rear exist in filth and cold and near-starvation; any perceived infraction of the laws set out by the mysterious dictator and former billionaire who constructed the 'Snowpiercer' results in brutal, crippling punishment. When things finally become so desperate they are forced to fight, the rear-car inhabitants discover that things are very different for the train's more esteemed passengers, who live comfortably and eat well and are untouched by the misery in the last cars. With the help of a drug-addict who was also the man who designed the doors on the train, the rebels engage in a violent battle to reach the engine, and the mysterious monarch responsible for it all, Wilford, played by Ed Harris.

Chris Evans is once again excellent as the protagonist Curtis Everett, who finds himself at the forefront of a revolution; Tilda Swinton is both comical and brilliantly villainous as Minister Mason, in the banal, bureaucratic way that for some reason is always far more infuriating than your Moriarty-type evil genius. Jamie Bell and John Hurt also co-star, as do Song Kang-Ho and Go Ah-Sung, as Mechanical Engineer turned addict Namgoong Minsu and his daughter Yona. Each new car introduces a surprising aspect of this unjust society built inside the belly of a steel python, and the admirably unpredictable writing brings to vivid life the disparity between both worlds. If you're looking for an action film with brains as well as balls, forget 'Lucy' and check out 'Snowpiercer'. {90/100}",1408406400,6,2754,5.061674008810573

6353230,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"I must be living in an alternate dimension because Rotten Tomatoes gave Snowpiercer a 95% ""Fresh"" and Amazon reviewers gave it four stars at the time of this posting.  Because of these strong reviews, I laid my $6.99 down thinking I was in for a treat especially with the release happening simultaneously in the theaters *and* on streaming devices (Side note:  I hope this trend continues).

However, I must have seen a *different* Snowpiercer because this one stank worse than a 3-day old black protein bar.

Don't get me wrong:  I'm a fan of the SciFi/P.A. genre and I really liked the actors in other roles. However, this was utterly unwatchable for three major reasons:  a)  A weak back story that left all of my attention on the utterly stupid plot to go from the back of the train to the front (I used to do this daily during my morning commute); b) There was zero character development (I could have cared less if a hero suddenly found himself with an ax embedded in his skull); and c) The tired, overly-choreographed, hack-and-slash CGI violence played on FOREVER.  I felt like I walked in on someone else playing a video game.  Honestly, this would have been *better* as a video game because at least then I would have had something to do with my time while watching this other than fast forwarding in a feeble attempt to find content.

If you really must see this, save your money and wait for it to stream for free on Prime or for it to pop up on Netflix.  At least your regret won't come at a price.",1408320000,7,1511,4.478102189781022

6353249,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"I'm a bit surprised that many of the people reviewing this film here are treating it like it's so very different from the usual sci-fi thriller. In my humble opinion, it isn't. The premise of the train is fairly unique, but it doesn't really make sense. Sure you could get into  all the symbolism of it, how the cars of the train represent social and economic classicism and all that other par-for-the-course metaphor, but again, that's something you see in a great deal of modern sci-fi. There is a good white guy with a dark past who fights some bad guys. The villain is even oddly polite and amicable, offering the main character some wine and steak, which was considered cliche back when Sean Connery was playing James Bond; and there is a twist that, by the time it arrives is obvious, etc. The only thing that I really found interesting was that the film had a great deal of difficulty deciding on tone. The characters would butcher their way through a crowd of conveniently faceless bad guys, and strait into a classroom full of rambunctious children for some forced exposition. The comedic relief is handled rather clumsily as well. Maybe I'm missing something, but while I did not hate Snowpiercer, it did not ""wow"" me at any point either. It's fine. It's palatable.

6353251,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"The story of an oppressed lower class rising up and revolting against their totalitarian overlords in a dystopian future is nothing new, but never before has it been done with as much visceral intensity, stunning acting, and thought-provoking themes as in Bong Joon-Ho's SNOWPIERCER. In the days after I viewed the film, I could NOT get it out of my head. Snowpiercer haunted my waking and sleeping hours with strange and searing images. Forgetting it's few small flaws - the plot holes and spotty CGI - we are left with a visceral, original and brilliantly acted look at desperation, hubris, and the importance of government.

The film is lead by a brilliant Chris Evans, playing Curtis: a man leading a desperate band of third-class passengers in a daring revolt against the ruling-class of the train. Chris Evans can only be described as an acting BEAST in this movie. He has an authority and gravitas about him, giving his stunning performance an edgy, haunted look that only comes when you have nothing to lose. Supporting him are Tilda Swinton, playing a despicable, supremely memorable villain, and a supporting cast of Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, Song Kang-ho, and Ewen Bremner, all of whom steal their scenes and embody their roles with subtle humanity.

The world of Snowpiercer feels real and frighteningly prescient. While the scientific aspect of the film is rather preposterous, the political issues raised so many ethical and moral questions for me in the days to come that my brain was a haze of conflicting opinions. But enough of ethics: Snowpiercer is visually stunning and immersive. Joon-Ho fills his film with striking images: a yellow dress in a field of grey, chilling (pun intended) images of frozen cities, a snowflake forming in mid-air.

But apart from acting, I was most impressed with the film's action. This isn't the beautiful gun-play of John Woo, nor the explosion poetry of Michael Bay. This is brutal, ugly, chaotic, gritty brawling that kills villains and heroes alike, leaving us cringing, gasping, or watching mesmerized through our fingers. Snowpiercer tears down the myth of the superhero. Good men die, bad men live, pain is caused, and people fight with hammers and knives because they have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

I don't want to jump to conclusions, nor do I want to convince people of anything, but in my personal opinion as a fan of science fiction and action, SNOWPIERCER is one of the best films I've seen in a while. Real, riveting, and ruthless, Snowpiercer keeps you guessing and gripped with powerful acting and brutal action. If you are a fan of science fiction, action, or want to be stimulated and entertained by a mature film...then SNOWPIERCER is the film for you! 5/5

6353265,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"Weird movie.  After it was over we googled ""What message is Snowpiercer trying to convey?"".  The answer is something about social injustice and the haves and the have not's  So the movie missed in that respect.  Also, our butts hurt from sitting and we had to stand up and take a 7th inning stretch and still had an hour of the movie left to watch.  It's long, long, long.  If you are a fan of the Korean film industry you will see a lot of familiar things here that might be missed by others who are not as well versed.  That was an interesting take away.  When the movie wants to be ironic and dark it nails it in the best sense of Korean films.  Of course there are supernatural feats of martial arts, it's a prerequisite for the genre.  I normally hate movies that are shot in one setting like an elevator, or a train.  But Snowpiercer did OK with it.  It has some huge misses, like the translators were not used consistently and it didn't make sense why they were necessary at times and not at others.  There's a cannibal theme which would have been more effective if the protein bars weren't made of roaches.  Weird movie.  But Chris Evans, now that dude should be getting a pay raise after this.  I'm not sure what else he has been in, but he's a good actor, and will bring in the money at whatever he does.  In summary, see the title",1407974400,2,1341,4.257936507936508

6353286,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Summer is the time where the Hollywood machinery throws all of its big blockbusters at the world. Most of them are made in a rather generic fashion, where they rarely challenge the viewer, and opt to give them all the things they want: cool action, big explosions, ground-breaking special effects, and sexy men and women. This summer has been no exception. Even with very well-received films such as DAYS OF FUTURE PAST or GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY being the most obvious in my mind, they were fun and exciting while I was watching but left very little to think about once the film was over. So, as a lover of film in almost all of the genres, I turned to some of the indepenent releases and found director Bong Joon Ho's first English-Language film SNOWPIERCER available to watch on VOD. Seeing trailers for it several months before, and following some of the publicity surrounding the film in regards to potential changes made by The Weinstein Company for American release, I was anticipating its release, but living in a city largely bereft of independent cinema releases available in theaters, I was very happy to find it on VOD, and I was even more ecstatic when I finished watching this masterwork of action sci-fi/social commentary.

The film opens with news coverage of an experiment of a potential victory over the onslaught of global warming. After this experiment is spread into the upper atmosphere, we skip forward to 2031, where the earth has been frozen solid in this experiment gone horribly wrong. All of the world's remaining inhabitants are now on a huge, super-fast train which has segmented its population into a class system. The poor inhabit the rear, and each car forward is inhabited by wealthier and more powerful people, and in between are a large compliment of armed guards designed to stop anyone from moving forward. The lower classes though refuse to live under the bootheel of the upper class, and they have a plan to take the train. Led by Curtis (Chris Evans), his right-hand man-child Edgar (Jamie Bell), and urged on by his mentor Gilliam (John Hurt) and despondent mother Tanya (Octavia Spencer), they start to enact their plan, which also focuses on the jailbreak of one of the designers of the train's doors, drug-addicted Namgoong (Song Kang-ho) and his precognitive daughter Yona (Go Ah-sung). Before they truly begin, though, they are soon confronted by the spokeswoman for the upper class, Mason (Tilda Swinton) and the security forces. Curtis soon enacts his plan, and they fight their way forward, and with each new car comes a new source of amazement and/or revulsion, and brings them closer to their fates.

The only film of Bong Joon Ho's I had seen previously was his monster movie THE HOST, which was also a blend of monster movie horror and social commentary. Traditionally, the horror and science fiction genres have been the most rife with allegorical storytelling, and this film is one of the best examples of this in recent cinema memory. Packed with tremendous performances, an incredibly smart script, and a remarkably surreal and exceptionally clever directorial style, SNOWPIERCER starts with a good slow burn, and then goes all in with unique plot twists, scenes of shocking and highly stylized violence, a strong emotional core and a lot of humor. Evans subverts some of his good guy action-heroism he's shown so strongly playing Captain America and turns in a marvelous, complex performance as the reluctant leader of this revolt. Bell gives a fresh and fun turn as Curtis' smartass sidekick. No one can play a mother quite like Octavia Spencer; she's always divine. Kang-ho is awesome playing against Evans, making their inability to communicate in the same language an added dimension of unspoken brotherhood. Ah-sung is gleeful and soulful to watch as the firecracker she is. Hurt, committed to the 'posh, gravelly thing', is splendid as always. But the performance that stands out is that of Swinton, with her upper-crust accent and parodical teeth that would be as easily at home in a Monty Python sketch as it would in this film. Her permanent attitude of benign yet fearsome authority is an absurd joy to behold.

SNOWPIERCER is a film that unfortunately went largely unnoticed by the masses who were sucked into repeated viewings of sequels, prequels, reboots and retcons, which is a real shame because when people complain about the lack of originality in Hollywood, it tends to be that they are denied the same access to the truly original films out there as there are to the behemoth of the blockbuster machine (make no mistake, I'm not anti-Hollywood; I just prefer great films to mediocre ones). It's also worth mentioning that even though this film is not a product of the Hollywood system, its release was almost derailed (no pun intended) by a man once perceived as a champion of artistic integrity and the great defender of the filmmaker's vision over studio interference: Harvey Weinstein. He had demanded almost 20 minutes of cuts as well as opening and closing voiceovers (and if you're a fan of sci-fi, this seems oddly reminiscent of the original theatrical cut of Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER). Joon Ho stuck to his guns, and the film was released unmolested, but was released to fewer theaters. But allowing it to come to VOD gave almost as many moviegoers access to this film as your average blockbuster film.

Anecdotes aside, SNOWPIERCER is certainly one of the year's best films, making this an banner year for Evans, as CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER is another of the year's best.",1407715200,6,5574,4.926595744680851

As an action flick, the action is dull and uninspired.  The world shifts uncomfortably from grimly ""real"" to completely fantastical, and not in a good way. The sequences that work (esp the school car sequence, with Alison Pill as a Kool-Aid drinking zealot of a teacher) are so out of whack with the rest of the movie as to shine a light on all its narrative failings.

Characters are flat and underdeveloped. You never feel anything for any of them. The only actor that garnered a reaction from me was Tilda Swinton, and that reaction was merely annoyance as she gleefully chewed the scenery in her fake teeth. Ultimately, her character does nothing for the plot, making her cartoonish presence even more irritating. The ""backstory"" for the main character is delivered MINUTES before the finale, when he - gasp! shock! - has to perform an action that directly correlates to the speech he just gave. Clumsy doesn't begin to describe it. The ending is as hollow as the rest of the film, especially if you're trying to glean a ""message"" from the proceedings.

6353319,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Incredible movie. Not sure whether to call it sci-fi adventure or post-apocalyptic but the general premise is as follows. Humanity is on it's last leg, with survivors of a human caused ice-age relegated to living on a self-sustaining train, society's class structures exist with people assigned a place on the train to live, rich/important at the front of the train w/ the poor being in the caboose. Chris Evans (Captain America/Fantastic 4) wants to change the class structure and leads a rebellion against the system and the architects/enforcers of the system, primarily Ed Harris (The Rock/Apollo 13) and Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton). The cast does a great job, the script is solid and the story, the real star of the movie, is fantastic. There are some predictable elements in terms of the general direction of the story but it is the character development that ties into the story elements that separates this movies from others in the sci-fi/post-apocalyptic genre.

The movie's visuals are incredible as the confined space of life on a train is very well conveyed, giving the audience the feeling of claustrophobia. Also the lighting in the movie is fantastic, especially a fight sequence with flickering lights, like violent silhouettes. Audio is good, clear sound effects, nice musical cues. I couldn't wait for Weinstein company to release this on home video in the US so I bought this version and because it is from a compatible region the blu-ray works fine on my blu-ray player.

6353323,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Theatrical review. There may be spoilers.

So here it is July 4th weekend. What are the sci-fi choices in theaters now? Well, I could go see the umpteenth version of ""Transformers"" which is playing in about 30 theater screens within a 5 mile radius of my house. Or, I could drive 10 miles and check out this unusual looking film from South Korean director Joon-ho Bong. It does have Chris Evans, fresh from ""Captain America"" and Tilda Swenton, last seen as an 80 year old woman in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" I decided to take the drive.

First of all, you have to buy into the premise. It's the near future and global warming is for real, so the scientists come up with a solution which, in fact, fixes the problem. They also kill everything on the planet with a catastrophic cold wave. The cockroaches survive as usual as you will find out later in the film. There are survivors who manage to board a train that circles the globe non-stop...forever. The train is the foresight of a man known as Wilford. I usual give actor credits here, but it is suggested I not, as it is a big surprise. It wasn't to me, but if you want to look it up go to IMDb or something.

Like much of the world, the train is split up into the ""have-nots"" led by Curtis (Evans) and his mentor, Gilliam (John Hurt). They live in the back of the train, far removed from the ""haves"" way up front. The 1 percenters are led by Wilford and his second in command, Mason (Swinton). And before I go much farther, she's a hoot. Especially when the contingent reach the kiddie's classroom. In addition, there are a collection of thugs whose mission is to keep the riff raff in the back where they belong. They live in squalor and get a protein bar for their daily ration. I won't go into the content but it will put your gag reflex in overdrive. As fair warning there are a couple more events that will unsettle most. But the film does do a good job of setting the stage for the conditions these people have been in for 17 years and why they want to escape.

Armed with little more than their determination, the rebellion is afoot. One by one the rebels move up car-by-car until they reach the domain of the guy in charge of the locks between the cars. Namgoon Minsoo (Kang-ho Song) is the guy and is aroused from his cryogenic sleep along with his daughter, Yona (Ah-sung Ko). He agrees to help (always in Korean) but only if he's supplied with a regular supply of homemade drug that he's addicted to. Essentially the film is as simple as that. Get to the engine where Wilford lives.

The combat portions of the film are excellent. The film is purposely dark and gloomy. It isn't a feel good movie. People you become fond of are killed. Kids are in the mix and are exploited, but damn if this isn't a refreshing change from the stuff we are often exposed to in mainstream movies. The film ends on a bleak, if hopeful note. But this isn't mainstream. Which is probably why the woman walking out of the theater behind me said to her husband. ""That's the worst movie I've ever seen""! She obviously hasn't see the latest ""Transformers.""",1407542400,58,3097,4.4073426573426575
6353324,1,B00JBBJJ4C,If I could give this stupid movie ZERO STARS I would!  This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am completely confused by all the good reviews.

The premise of the movie is totally ridiculous.  But it didn't matter.  The characters are so mesmerizing that I kept watching ""just to see"" what happens.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the ending at all.  In fact I thought it was pretty appropriate considering the ""humanity"" on the train even the ""good guys"" were all pretty much a waste.  Someone mentioned that it was confusing how all through the movie they were talking about folks dying immediately if they leave the train but then the girl walks out as is fine.  They must have missed the conversation Namgoong has with Curtis and his observations that the snow is melting...which means it's warming up.  Guess those folks weren't paying attention.  There were some things that weren't thoroughly explained (Yona's clairvoyance was one) but at the end of the day, it really didn't matter.

This movie is a cocktail of Hunger Games, 1984, 2012 and a few others thrown in, but I found it entertaining.  The weird and wacky camp comedy parts of this just added a kind of ""Wha da fud"" moments that enhanced it.",1407456000,,1304,4.682819383259912

6353334,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"My wife and I had no prior exposure to ""Snowpiercer"", so we had no expectations and missed out on any hype that may have surrounded the film prior to release.  That being said, we enjoyed it quite a bit.  We are both avid sci-fi fans, and we ended up making comparisons between this film's premise and the slate of ""generation starships"" or ""slowboat"" stories that follow a similar concept.  Instead of a starship, we have a train.  But the parallels are striking; The closed ecology... The limits on sustainable population... The poor passengers in the back vs the privileged in the front... Class warfare... Death outside the walls... Always in motion...  If you have read any stories about humanity taking to the stars in slower-than-light-speed starships, you will recognize elements of the genre in this film.
There was an almost ""Terry Gilliam"" style of absurd humor in places, reminiscent of ""12 Monkeys"" or ""Brazil"".  This appeals to us greatly, and helped provide balance to the otherwise grim tale.  In fact, if you liked 12 Monkeys, you will probably like this film as well.
The acting is good for the most part.  The cinematography is memorable, as are the sets and special effects.  There is some gore and prolonged scenes of bloody battle, but it works for the story.
The only reason we give it 4 stars instead of 5 is we felt there were some holes in the story line that went unanswered (such as, why do they have to keep moving?).  I recognize that this may have been the film-maker's intent, but it had the effect of pulling us out of the moment on occasion.

If you are willing to suspend your disbelief in the setting, the depth of the story comes through, and is very well supported by convincing and complex characters throughout. While it has a lot of action, it also is a very thoughtful film, and while it hits you over the head with the literal class warfare and social struggle, it also layers nuance about people, struggles, and wealth disparity. It lives in a middle-ground between art house and mainstream. If that appeals to you, as it does to me, I think you will enjoy this immensely.

I love movies that take me out of my head and into someone elses strange world such as Brazil, Upside Down, Middle Earth and Hogsmead. Because were a Pacific rim nation it shouldnt surprise us to see more films from artists coming out of China, Japan and in this case Korea.  Bong Joon-Ho gives us his dystopian world in which mankinds attempt to thwart global warming backfires and causes an ice age that results in the remnants of humanity living aboard a perpetual train that circles the frozen planet and celebrates New Year every time it crosses the Ekaterina bridge.  In the very front is the perpetual engine and home of Wilford of Wilford Industries who had the foresight to know what was going to happen before it did and built the worlds most luxurious train with first class going to makers and the rear going to takers.  Nah, no allegory there.  The makers get hard boiled eggs as a New Year Holiday treat.  The takers kind of got legs and arms though its said the babies tasted best.  But at some point it became necessary to provide actual food, sort of, instead of tender babies, the reason to be revealed at the end.

Octavia Spencer (Fabulous), John Hurt (Remember him?), Ed Harris (HaChaChaChaCha), Tilda Swinton (She can just play anyone), Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot), and Chris Evans (Captain America) populate the world of Snowpiercer which is set on a perpetual train running on a track that circles the globe, a feat that becomes doable after the Earth freezes.  Kang-ho Song and Ah-sung Ko portray the agents of change.

So its a simple little tale of the oppressed overcoming their oppressors and as they make it from the rear of the train to the front we are taken on a surreal journey of train life complete with a car full of swimming pools, a car that is a walk through aquarium and others as each car is richer as they move forward.

The reveals of the film tell the story so I won't share them with you here.  Suffice it to say this was a big movie fit into a tiny space and unlike anything Ive seen.  In that regard it is unique.  Its a familiar story told in a new and interesting way.  That alone makes it special.  That this allegorical film could be called The Tea Party Express makes it even more special.  Especially when they reach their ultimate destination.  That it's source is a French graphic novel only makes even more sense.",1407196800,2,2388,4.552693208430913

The US version is encoded at an average (on my calculation) of around 20 mbps. The sound didn't break 2200 kbps (and claims to be 5.1) and the picture is CROPPED to 1:78:1. Buy this for the special features, only. And they're nice, for the record. If you want the best edition, it was the Hong Kong (for being  Region A and affordable) but now, thanks to this release, the Korean editions have come down in price somewhat (not the limited editions but the wide release two-disc editions) and I think, for that reason, it is safe to say that it is now the Korean, Region A, which has better compression, better encoding, the full original aspect ratio, crazy dense sound transfer that sounds incredible (and you can push the subtitle button to get them to turn on and off because it has an English option). Second best, the French edition, Region B, which has a beautiful picture (that was encoded about 5 mbps less than it should have been, but that's life, and the best sound outside of South Korea, up to the point, but it can't hold a candle to the Korean transfer which was put out by CJ entertainment via their distribution and via Kimchi. I am truly horrified by the lack of care that went into the American transfer and release. Anchor Bay should issue a public apology. CROPPED! They're animals.

Hello. This is a specific review for the best of the Blu-Ray releases of Snowpiercer and, oddly, has been linked through to the DVD page without any option to remove it on that page. If you are looking for information on the DVD edition, I don't want to waste your time with this as it is Blu-Ray only. Thanks and good luck making your selection.

Blu-Ray:  (Read here for Blu-ray edition comparison and information, absent my pontification, for the most part.)

There are now several Region A options available including a Hong Kong release, Japan release and the Korean Kimchee releases with an American release sure to be released at some point given ticket sales. All but one are priced, it would seem, by mental patients and are only worth it if you are filthy stinking rich (which I am not so, moving on). The short version, for picture quality and sound, you can't beat the Eastern markets and the Hong Kong release is the most reasonably priced of those options to be expanded on below. There are also several Region B options, unfortunately, without subtitle options in English, as no UK release has arrived or even been announced and there is a tendency not to put English subtitles on individual vendor releases (releases that don't all use the same master print) in non-English speaking countries. And so, back to the Region A options.

Of the Region A options, Hong Kong by Panorama is the only one priced to purchase (yup, it is actually the cheapest at $36 as I write this, including shipping). However, as the only release with English subtitles for under $40, it is important to note that the subtitles can either be off or on... that is to say on screen, for the whole of the film or off screen. It was pointed out to me that some people have better Blu-ray players than I do, ones that have a subtitle-on/off button and it is worth considering your Blu-ray player and the inclusion or exclusion of this feature if you are looking at this release. In theory, absent this feature, you could pause the film and change the settings repeatedly while watching but we both know you are not going to do that. (I'm certainly not.) That having been said, you can just turn them on for the big speech at the end which lasts only two minutes and then turn them off. (Hint: They are sitting down facing each other.) Regardless of your preference, this edition has the English subtitles and they are not ""forced"" (ones that can never be turned off) but, without external intervention by you, they are continuous in that they cannot be removed once turned on without pausing the film to remove them or using other programing to achieve turning them off. To clarify, you can watch and not understand what I consider to be a large enough portion of the film that I was unhappy with this oversight on Panorama's part or you can watch and understand via subtitles that cannot be removed for the English portion of the film (which you already understand if you are a region A viewer who cared enough to purchase this film on Blu-ray with no other subtitle options except for, I believe, Chinese).

If subtitles are unimportant to you, then you have the option of including the Region B, English-subtitle-free releases available for your consideration. For the Region B releases, there are two main prints circulating: the French Warner Brothers release print which preserves the original aspect ratio of 1:85:1 and the Italian by Koch media that has been sized to fit a 1:78:1 screen. (There is also a German print that has not been compared favorably to the picture quality of the French version though it also maintains the original aspect ratio.) Of these options, there are pros and cons and a clear winner (French). The Koch Italian Blu-ray has superior quality in picture and vastly superior audio, however, it is the one that cuts the sides off of every shot to make it fit your screen perfectly. Additionally, some viewers have complained that the blacks are not black/rich/deep enough (though that can easily be corrected with a tweak on your television settings), however, the black depth is optimal in the French version. The French version has very high picture and audio quality but is not the ""best available"" and is inferior enough that, for audio alone, I prefer the Italian edition. It is important to note here that I am an audiophile and this choice is not in line with what most consumers would select given all choices (French version). And what about features? The Koch edition has a bunch, some in English and some in Italian. The French edition has a bunch, mostly in French, including a documentary that runs 54 minutes and is mostly in French with no English subtitle option or download patch version. Still, they are both high quality releases and, if you could get a good deal on either, they would be worth the money, if you have a region free player.

And that having been said, if you are in America or Canada and are not wealthy enough to purchase a region free Blu-ray player or if you are there and are not, at the very least, a poor person (like me) who was lucky enough to have manipulated someone into getting you the best Christmas present ever last year, then your only choice is to purchase Region A or make your peace with having to wait until the American release arrives and the distributor releases the relevant stats on picture and audio quality.

On another note, digital download is available which can be corrupted and is always of lower quality but is great if you just want to see it once in a while, not fawn over it. However, if you are just looking to see the thing once, iTunes has it for rent, Amazon has it for rent and DirecTV and so on and so forth have it on their VOD services. But if you want a pristine copy for home viewing, these are your current best options and I highly recommend the Hong Kong release for those who are limited to Region A viewing only, the French release for composition hounds (those who can't abide the loss of the slivers down the left and right side of the picture that were cut to force proper fitting to a 16:9 screen) and the Italian release by Koch for video and audiophiles as it has a higher quality picture (by enough to make a difference but not enough to blow your mind) and much higher quality audio (by fully doubling the quality over any other region B release). Good luck with this. It is not an easy choice.

UPDATE:

A Region A, North American release has been scheduled, tentatively for October 1, 2014, by Anchor Bay/Starz. No press release has been issued concerning special features though it is a safe bet that this version will, like the theatrical release, contain English subtitles only for Korean dialogue, which, at the very least, makes this worth the buy if you like this film. There is no information regarding video or audio speed or the quality of the transfers, status on 5.1 vs. 6.1 vs. 7.1 master audio or if the files will be LPCM. Additionally, it is unknown as to whether there will be a special or deluxe edition down the line. If I had to guess, this is one of those films that will only receive a double disc edition if the first edition sells very well and demand is high. As for the size, 25 or 50GB, initial information was that it would be a 50GB Blu-ray but no confirmation has been given. I will post additional information as it becomes available. As of now, early August, the Hong Kong release is still the best bet, for the money. As for cropping, I saw this cropped in theater (a 1:78:1 presentation) and have a lovely 1:85:1 print from Hong Kong. I can't imagine that they would crop this, however, it is always possible. My recommendation is to pre-order this to lock in the price and watch for more information as it becomes available. You can always cancel if they crop the image or pull some stunt like 685 kbps audio instead of the standard of at least 3000 kbps (and really good Blu-rays are doing 6000 now) or, like me, collect multiple editions for different audio, picture and features.

FILM:

What can I say that hasn't been said? Well, some. However, don't read this if you have read a bunch already as I am unlikely to blow your mind with some magnificent review of a film you will probably be seeing if you've read far enough to come across my review in the first place. Face it, you are already interested.

This is a science fiction/action film and, somehow, with the incredible direction, production, cinematography, set design, score and, of course, acting, it is really a drama. If someone asked me, I'd wouldn't know what to say. It is as though they took high art independent film drama, impressive all by itself, and transformed it into a sci-fi/action/thrill-ride without diminishing the drama or adding needless comedic silliness. I don't know what to call this but, without doubt, it is the best film I've seen in theater in over a decade. I've seen approximately 100 films that way in that time. It is in the top twenty I've seen in the last decade overall, including all dvd and blu-ray options and television commercial free airings. I've seen approximately 500. The writing is excellent, not surprising as it is Bong Joon-ho's adaptation of a decade's old graphic novel that people still talk about. The direction is excellent, again, thanks to writer/director Bong. The acting is, you guessed it, excellent and you can skip down to the Blu-ray section if that is unimportant to you.

Starting with John Hurt, I can only say he is perfect, as he always is. (Anyone who can make Doctor Zero--the one we've never heard of before--pop off the screen, dwarfing both the 10th and 11th doctor to such an extant one might actually forget they were even there, is an actor who doesn't need my praise. He is an acting god.)

Tilda Swinton is magic, pure and easy. She makes it seem as though her job is fun and simple when it is a tremendous effort born of intense planning and practice and in this role she shines, as in all others.

Chris Evans, an actor too often misunderstood in his style, is true to form in his decision to always analyze the emotion before attempting to play it, rather than just tossing whatever imitation came to mind while sitting in a back-lot caravan on break or sleeping, up at the camera, out to the audience, as though we can't tell if the feeling is appropriate for the character in that moment. My favorite example of mindful acting, for him, is The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond, in which he showcased a brilliant ability to play repression without mistakenly conveying depression, an error nearly every actor out there has made at one time or another, generally when they are very young. In Snowpiercer, with similar mindfulness, he seeks to convey a man beaten down to nothing, having pulled himself back up, under the guidance of a revolutionary and father figure, into a creature of will. He has one goal, to lead the revolt, leave the past behind him and fight his way to the front of the Snowpiercer, the massive train you've read about in the other reviews. As he moves through the train, so does he move through his past life, slashing and crushing and tearing at the constructed reality he left behind 18 years ago, when the world ended and his nightmare version of life, a terror that would become the truest reality he could ever have experienced, swelled up around him and swallowed him. We see none of this, of course, or it wouldn't be a great performance. He doesn't flash back or have long conversations about afternoons wandering the hillsides, but he shows us in the absence of joy and the glances away from reminders of what once was, in moments of planning and flailing and moments of internal reflection, without having to rely on these tools of inadequate performance. To see him alongside actors who can be legitimately labeled as perfect, never failing, never faltering, having worked at it for so many years that any writer or director would believe they had won the lottery to have them, Hurt and Swinton and, in the very end, Ed Harris (who I adore), showcasing talent on their screen, Chris Evans, the only Avenger to ever look around him in moments of false and manufactured humor with an expression of ""why am I here"", while the clowns danced around him, was magnificent and, for that very reason, for being one of the Marvel actors who don't have the opportunity to give you something real, he deserves praise. I am impressed and that doesn't come easy for me. I used to say he's a good actor, citing indie films and random moments in Captain America that almost made it something people might remember in a hundred years, but no more. He is an actor, a true actor, a great actor and, even surrounded by this unbelievable cast of performers, he shines, holds his own, dominates the film and never fails to give the best, highest, most appropriate line reading, literally pitch perfect, even with all that running.

So, if you enjoy science fiction and drama, if you enjoy films that take themselves seriously and don't overcompensate for a weak plot with out of place comedy, if you enjoy films in which characters understand the gravity of their situation and have actual feelings, if you enjoy films with action and excitement interwoven with political and social and religious and philosophical explorations presented through story and idea rather than endless prattle or speeches meant to explain or talk down to an audience the producers believe is made up of morons, if you enjoy storytelling without all the clich&eacute; and giant robots... well... congratulations on not being a tool. Also, go see this movie or purchase it and enjoy just as soon as you can. I hate seeing films in theater for too many reasons to list but I saw this one and I will see it again, so take that for whatever it is worth.

Essential Point:

Don't buy the Hong Kong Region A unless you can live with permanent subtitles, not understanding dialogue or having to pause at a couple of critical moments to get subtitles back on. Do buy it if you are limited to Region A as it is the best option available for under $40 and others start at $50 not including shipping. Additionally, the Hong Kong picture is excellent and the sound is also excellent. Don't buy any non-UK region B unless you have a region free player and don't need subtitles at all but if you have one and want a region B to play in it, France is best for preserving original composition with no removal of side edges to fit your 16:9 screen and Italy is best for picture overall and is, most importantly, best for audio with a much higher quality track at double the megabytes and 24 bit rather than the standard 16 on the French release. Or, if none fit your needs but you are still interested, you can wait for the uncut Region A release due out sometime soon, though with no specs of any kind.

The mechanics of having a single train house the human race aside, Snowpiercer is a distillation of the human condition. A metaphor if you will, simplified with its separate components exaggerated to tell a story about class structure, and the deluded notion that the human race is predictable, and as such controllable.

The story centers around an uprising lead by a man called Curtis (Chris Evans), and a quest to reach the front of the train. Along the way, as they break through to each new compartment, new environments and mysteries unfold. Snowpiercer is inventive, and violent at times, but always entertaining and certainly one of the more unique films to hit theaters in the last two years.",1407110400,96,1085,4.988950276243094

The characters are over the top in that sci fi channel unbelievable way, as is the plot, storyline, dialogue, etc.  Look, I understand that a self sustaining train running around a post apocalyptic world is not the most believable concept, but other movies have had far less believable premises which were made believable by a great plot and acting.  This movie is not one of them, from the Monty phtyon-esque characters which are presented seriously to the environments where the last people on earth are stuck in a perpetual rave party complete with industrial waste sniffable drugs which double as explosives.  It's just ridiculous, which I don't mind if the movie presents itself that way.

6353400,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"Frozen wasteland of future-earth is nothing new but its implementation was unique and had me drawn in....at the beginning of the film.  A bit after the halfway mark, a Clockwork Orange-esque sequence totally threw me, and it took the film off-track (no pun intended).
I love action movies, I am a total sci-fi geek, and though I do enjoy a substantive film that calls for brain power, I don't always require it.  Sometimes you are lucky enough to get all of that in a single movie.  Then there are movies that simply try to be all things at once and they try too hard.  This film falls into the latter category.
If you are intent on seeing this movie, at least wait until the price goes down.  Or be prepared to be disappointed by the following:
Lack of character depth--relationships between the characters are implied by mere minutes of conversation rather than developed, and you know so little about any that it's difficult to feel an affinity for a single one including the lead (despite Chris Evans' piercing eyes)
Motive -- Life for people at the back of the train is bad but aside from 2 brief scenes, the film does not develop a sense of desperation.  Rather, the characters simply tell each other they have to do something soon....so desperately soon
Logic -- No, not complex logic but 1+1 = 2 type of logic.  I am irked by the fact that the passengers at the back of the train know how good life is for the elite enough to need to rebel, however, they've never been exposed to it.  The good life is implied by nice clothes but beyond that, nope.
And then, towards the end, everything is laid out in words for the viewer through two different conversations.  For a movie that tries to be smart, tis a shame when no inference can be drawn but rather short conversations lay out the guts of the movie in convos that each last less than 5 minutes.
This movie really is about 2.5 stars, and after I sleep on it, I might drop it down another .5 despite wanting so much to like it more.",1406937600,,1990,4.4301369863013695

For good reason too, and if I were in charge of handing out awards, I would immediately without a second thought hand over trophies to Kyung-pyo Hong (cinematography), Joon-ho Bong (direction) and the absolutely amazing Tilda Swinton.

The mechanics of having a single train house the human race aside, Snowpiercer is a distillation of the human condition. A metaphor if you will, simplified with its separate components exaggerated to tell a story about class structure, and the deluded notion that the human race is predictable, and as such controllable.

The story centers around an uprising lead by a man called Curtis (Chris Evans), and a quest to reach the front of the train. Along the way, as they break through to each new compartment, new environments and mysteries unfold. Snowpiercer is inventive, and violent at times, but always entertaining and certainly one of the more unique films to hit theaters in the last two years.",1406851200,,1085,4.988950276243094

6353428,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer is a French graphic novel, directed by a South Korean director and with an English cast. Most would think a setup like that would spell disaster, but IMHO it worked beautifully. This came across to me as the film Quentin Tarantino always wanted to make but couldn't.

In the near future a cure for global warming was found and injected into the atmosphere. In classic fashion, it backfired and sent the Earth to a second ice age. All of humanity is wiped out save those trapped on a futuristic train that travels around the world nonstop. Built by an eccentric Walt Disney doppelganger (Ed Harris) the train is split in economic zones. Rich in the front, poor in the back. Chris Evans leads a disenfranchised motley crew from train car to train car engaging in axe battles. As they proceed forward some of the train cars are so wacky that they conjure a feeling of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

Absurd? You bet, and in the best way possible. Trying to take this film too seriously will have you at odds from the start. My only complaint is that it drags on a little too long and it tries to pull too much meaning and symbolism in the end that's not needed and serves to muddle the style it has already so expertly achieved.

The cinematography is very nice and gives off the feeling of a graphic novel. There are few CG effects and they come from the lower budget scale. I forgave it quickly considering most summer blockbusters are now 80% computer generated, rendering cinematography something to be decided by Pixar in post production.

6353439,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"`Snowpiercer' is a South Korean film based on a French graphic novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Transperceneige/dp/B00KBGKX0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Transperceneige</a>). So of course, the protagonist is played by Chris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America/dp/B005ZCXPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America</a>) Evans. But a beard and some significant emotional range render Evans largely unrecognizable to fans of Cap. The film and the 1982 book that inspired it present a completely novel approach to the post-apocalyptic genre. In the world of `Snowpiercer,' the last remnants of humanity survive on a giant train that offers shelter from the brutal cold of a man-made ice age.

Like all passenger trains, this one offers different accommodations to different classes of passengers, and this has become a rigidly-enforced caste system. Those at the head of the train live in luxury, while those in the tail can barely survive. Strong doors and armed guards ensure that tail passengers do not move to the front. When the tail-enders stage a revolt, 126 minutes of action unfold.

The premise is so fundamentally French, it's a shame that the film doesn't include any French characters. The idea of a world-spanning rail line is too far-fetched for the highway-focused American mind, but not for Europeans who can reliably traverse the continent by train. Moreover, the train's class system echoes the famous Estates of the Ancien Regime, and the pseudo-Marxist revolt of the tail-enders resonates with a state that is currently in its Fifth Republic. With that being said, the inclusion of Korean characters (who largely speak Korean with English subtitles) reinforces the notion that the train is humanity's last hope, not merely the last hope of one western nation or another.

`Snowpiercer' reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000GJPL1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B0047WJ11G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>&nbsp;and Gene Wolfe's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-the-New-Sun/dp/1568658079/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of the New Sun</a>.

All remaining human life exists on a train that never stops. The train contains almost everything needed to sustain its own function and to sustain life.  The plot is provided by the almost everything part and the conflict that predictably arises among passengers. Is it enjoyable? I found it so but it would not be  for anyone who needs a story with a sunny disposition and a happy outcome.

6353470,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"The movie was actually pretty well done dystopian world that explored some interesting themes. The initial setting drives a class warefare theme, however, it explores quite a few others as well.

The story opens on a train that never stops as it circles a frozen earth. The folks in the back of the train live in squalor and the people in the front live a posh life while one person who is revered like a god lives in the engine. The train's backenders quickly rebel and begin to fight their way to the front of the train. Along they way, they pass from car to car learning how life on the rest of the train actually functions in a closed environment. The final lesson of the closed world economics when they rebellion reaches the engine and they confront ""God"". Up to this point, the movie is a fun ride and well done and deserving of 4 stars.  Alas, it is the ending that costs the movie a star. There is a climatic moment when rebels confront the leader and the world they live in. But then the story kind of just ends with no real denouement phase which leaves the viewer a bit wanting.

However, one point that I should make is that the book is based upon a French story and the movie produced by a Korean making his first English movie. I believe these influences create two things: 1) a lot of subtle ideology within the film that is lost on the average US consumer (movie is too complex to just call it a class warfare dystopian story) and 2) The story structure is somewhat different than the standard Hollywood cookie cutter scripts. I like the break from this cookie cutter template (I watch a lot of foreign film and find different story structure refreshing). However, the break from hollywood templates doesn't justify the abrupt ending in this case.  It is the ending that costs this movie a star in this fan's opinion.

All that said about the end, I want to end on a much more positive note. The movie is a fun ride with good acting, great costumes and sets, and thrilling action sequences. As I said, the movie explores some subtle (and some not so subtle) themes without being preachy. Tension and conflict in the movie abound and keep the plot moving forward as the stakes get higher and higher as the story moves along. At no point did I think the story itself bogged down. I thought this was a pretty good entry into the US market for Bong Joon-Ho and will definitely look for more of his work.",1406678400,7,2416,4.420224719101124

6353486,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"This was among the most poorly thought-out stories I've seen in a long time. It includes some SPOILERS - so don't read this if you insist on ignoring my advice to pass on this movie.

 It's just so idiotic and completely unbelievable in so many ways - everything from the set up of how the different characters are introduced, to the individual predicaments they face,  and the worst of all..... the idea of the characters being the last several hundred humans on the planet, but they are are stuck on a world-circling train (that apparently cannot stop!) and that continues to circle the world once per year (for the last 18 years!) despite the fact that there are no other people in the world to maintain the infrastructure (tracks, bridges, tunnels, and presumably ocean-spanning passages, etc).....OH, and I almost forgot the best part,,,,,the minor little fact that this is all happening several decades after earth has apparently gone into a world-wide ice age!

There are so many cliches and stupid one-liners, and so many plot points inserted for grossness, or attempted humor, or to give the stars something to do (never mind that the things happening are illogical, and just plain dumb, and are not actions that real humans would take if in that situation).  The ending is very fitting (seeing that it makes zero sense....and everything the protagonist has been fighting for throughout the film is for nothing)....they crash the train in the middle of a huge mountain range (with most of the train cars (and people) plunging over the side of a cliff, and with a few of the cars plowing into a snow bank....killing basically everyone....except for a clairvoyant 17 year old Japanese girl, and a 5 year old little boy (who was kidnapped by the bad guys early in the movie so he could  squeeze into the engine and keep it running).

6353493,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Watching this reminds me of when movies used to be enjoyable and engaging. This was a weird, fun movie. 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element -- that kind of thing. I miss movies like this.

It puts style and aesthetic first, and worries about logistics later. There was one logistical quirk in the movie that made me shake my head a bit, but I quickly got over it. It's just not important to a movie like this.

It's got a great pace. It starts out running, giving the audience just a general gist of the train's strong class-divide as the conflict quickly starts.  However, further context about the class-divide and the main character are given piece-by-piece as the conflict moves forward, towards the front of the train. The end has some revelations about the main character that definitely took me by surprise, and gives the whole story another layer. Don't think you have this movie figured out halfway through watching it, it will likely still surprise you.

Tilda Swinton is raved about for good reason. But Chris Evans deserves just as much praise, as this is easily the best performance I've seen from him, for a very conflicted character. You might think he's just the atypical reluctant hero at first -- but by the end of the movie you see that his character is much more complex than that.

Also: just want to mention that this movie is really not about global warming at all. It's just a negligible explanation as to what makes the train important. The outside world could be a nuclear holocaust -- it wouldn't really change anything. Anyone who makes an issue out of global warming in their review either really hasn't seen the movie, or is just a political nutbag who has to hate on anything that doesn't fit into their bubble. Don't be that way, it's not worth it. Atlas Shrugged was garbage, and this is a great movie. Politics aside, that's just the way it is. Don't force yourself into trashy art for the sake of political comfort. Or do, but kindly keep it to yourself.

There are complaints that one could make about this movie. But I'm not going to bother. They're the same complaints one could make about any stylistic sci-fi. Enjoy the movie for what it is, in its unique glory. I'm just so happy that someone out there is still making good stylistic movies (thank you South Korea), while Hollywood regurgitates more superheroes. This movie is an oasis in a desert of garbage as far as I'm concerned, so I'm just glad to have something worth drinking for a change.",1406592000,,2482,4.629545454545455

Tilda Swanson was dead on as the bureaucrat and got it that she hand to play it broad as other actors played it to safe. Also the pace was off when they had to stop between cars and get some exposition out of the way.

It was refreshing not to have to see people fighting crazy monsters but fighting their own humanity in order to survive then fighting their survival instincts in order to become human.

It was interesting to see John Hurt in another dark dystopian film & most of the actors performed well.  The concept of a microcosm of humanity surviving on a speeding train was compelling, especially as the action kept moving forward, literally toward the engine & figuratively toward freedom, presumably.  But unlike a host of Orwellian-Huxleyian types of films -- for example, The Island -- it's far-fetched & weird & even disgusting, e.g. the ingredients of the gelled protein bars they subsist on or the playdoh-like Kronole they can't get enough of.  Tilda Swinton needs to be seen to be believed, channeling a combination of Nurse Ratchett & a Nazi matron.  The ending will not be what you expect & to say the least, it's preposterous.

Will he choose to abandon his lower class values to be bought off by the comfort and plenty of the upper class? A question we all might ask ourselves should the opportunity arise.

And at the end they revealed how the train works. Ok, sure, kids manually do the job but I'm sure they get tired from doing it. They can't work 24/7 doing just that.

Having said that, I think the movie is still good. I would highly recommend it. Just don't find answers or meaning to everything you see and take it as it is. It's hard to make sense on things that doesn't have any.",1406419200,,865,4.468354430379747

6353544,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"I read the glowing critical reviews; I expected the utmost acting of Tilda Swinton, Olivia Spencer, and Ed Harris in a serious drama; and I fully admit to being seduced into watching this ""tour de force"" of political commentary as to the perils of ignoring climate change. But big note to future viewers, I feel compelled to note that I 100% missed the sarcasm evident in the above reasons why pretty much everybody is heralding this movie as a critical darling.

This movie is not a concentrated look at the psychological effects of a post-apocalyptic world inside of a train. It is instead a good action movie with subversive campy elements.

Since I went into this movie under the misconception that it would be a serious look at the psychological effects of massive world death resulting in the microcosm of culture on a train, I f*ing hated this movie. From that perception, I give this movie 1 star. However, without the preconceptions given to me by reviews before watching it, I would rate this as a solid action movie that actively involved the viewer with multiple melodramatic and inside winks, which would have made me rate it a 4 or 5. No one can honestly say the actors went into this seriously as Oscar bait, except for the main guy who played Curtis who clearly missed the gist completely. My especial kudos to Ed Harris for knowing what kind of movie he was in and selling it to the highest.

This movie is a sleeper critical hit that has been mislabeled via word of mouth to its detriment. Go into it expecting a good action movie and be pleasantly surprised, or otherwise have your expectations blown to bits.",1406332800,,1628,4.645833333333333

This film is a brilliant concept that works for the most part.  It is part drama, part action movie, and wholly allegorical (a film that symbolizes the hierarchy of the class system existing between the rich/poor and those in power/those ruled over, and the mechanisms that hold this system in place).  Great acting (especially Tilda Swinton), great directing, and beautifully bleak set pieces. The special effects and CGI do fall a bit short however.
I also had a few problems with the ending and the minimal payoff it provides in my opinion.

 I'm an adult man, and I love films of all kinds, from ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and much in between. However, even immediately after my friend and I watched it, we had to work hard to remember any specific and special parts of the film between the good opening scene (in which, however, the hero is instantly made apparent to us since he is dressed very differently than all the others in the scene) and the last (which made only the smallest -- no, delete that -- NO sense whatsoever).  Ed Harris is great, but even his late appearance in the film could not save it as his lines slowly degenerated into statements that made less and less sense.  Tilda Swinton's character slides from evil to absurd.

Even the art direction (sets, etc) couldn't save this dreadful mash-up.

I very much enjoyed this train ride and will be recommending it to my friends.  Throughout the film, while I questioned one character's actions, so did an ancillary character as well.  Indicating to me, that the author of this screen-play (as well as the original author) thought things through.

There's no reason to even go into why people would survive by riding a train built to continuously circle the earth.  That's only about the 10th thing wrong with this movie.

This movie stinks* and is an utter waste of time.  As a science fiction movie, it fails by being completely preposterous.  As an action movie, it fails with lame action and slow pace.  As some kind of profound statement on capitalism, class structure, the environment, etc it fails by being ham-handed, badly written, tedious and muddled.  Small children taken from the poor to run ""the engine"" - gee, that's so subtle I'm not sure I got it :)  Well, everyone dies, but at least a random polar bear is still alive for the final fade away shot (I'm not kidding).

6353572,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"The practices of the Hollywood studios frequently perplex me. Very often, they will all stay clear of a potential big release, like Transformers: Age of Extinction,  because they don't want their film to go up against the big competition. If the big release flops, or underperforms, they then have to compete against a number of other films which also left the previous weekend due to perceived competition. One week, one big film, the next, four. The Weinstein brothers, who left their company Miramax to start The Weinstein Company, frequently buy independently made films at film festivals. Many companies compete for the biggest titles at film festivals and the Weinstens will frequently buy a popular film simply to keep it out of the hands of a competitor. They reportedly have hundreds of films on their shelves, starring big stars or up-and-comers (who are probably now big stars) that have never been released because they couldn't figure out how to market them.

""Snowpiercer, the new film from director Bong Joon-ho (or the Westernized version: Joon-ho Bong, The Host, Mother) and co-written by Bong and Kelly Masterson (Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead), is a film receiving almost orgasmicly good reviews and word-of-mouth on the festival circuit. The Weinstein Company (TWC) snapped it up. When a film is receiving word-of-mouth like this - Entertainment Weekly has mentioned the film many times, urging people to see it - you would expect the company releasing it to capitalize on that. TWC decided to release it the same weekend as Transformers. Okay. Maybe someone is finally listening and decided to give a big, multi-screen release some competition. Errr, no. They released the film, a science fiction film featuring some mind-blowing special effects and production design, to one theater in Los Angeles, an independent theater with small-ish screens. Not the ideal environment to see what could be the next sci-fi epic. The next week, they added one screen at the worst theater in Santa Monica. My husband and I went to the first show and the projector was broken. I mentioned that I doubted it would still be playing the following weekend. It wasnt. TWC was not making it easy to see this film. On the other hand, I had the choice of fifty screens in a ten-mile radius to choose from if I wanted to see Transformers. But the weekend after that,Snowpiercer was available On Demand. We rented it and watched it. Again, not the ideal way to watch such a film, but I was eager to see it.

I recently saw a story about TWCs decision to release the film so quickly to VOD. The company stated they made $2.6 million from the theatrical release and $11 million from the first weekend of VOD. TWC made more money from the VOD because their percentage of VOD sales is higher than theater ticket sales. Still, it seems a slight to a film that people clearly like. Give a film the respect it deserves by showing it in theaters, in the way it was meant to be seen, on a big screen.

A brief prologue establishes how the world fell into a new Ice Age. Picking up seventeen years later, we meet a rag-tag group of people living in the last car of a huge, very complex train circling the Earth, carrying the last human survivors who are forced to live in cars based on their place in society. The last car contains the underprivileged, the poor, the sick, forced to eat protein blocks provided to them by the people who run the train, the privileged ruling class who occupy the luxury cars at the front of the train. Curtis (Chris Evans, who made this film between The Avengers and Captain America 2), is fed-up with the status quo. He has lived on the train as long as he lived on Earth as a normal member of society, and he has seen a number of failed rebellions on the train, but he thinks they have a chance this time. His buddy, Edgar (Jamie Bell) is reluctant but agrees to go ahead with the plan. Their elder, Gilliam (John Hurt), also feels the timing is right, so they come up with a plan. Grey (Luke Pasqualino, BBC Americas The Musketeers, Skins), a very physical warrior, is able to overcome soldiers using his training. Tanyas (Octavia Spencer) son is taken by the people at the front of the train, prompting her to join the fight. They begin their plan which involves breaking Namgoong (Kang-ho Song), the designer of the security system for the train, out of prison, which is the next car ahead. When they have him, the plan is to work through the cars, making their way to the engine designed by the visionary Wilford, years before the Ice Age. Wilford (Ed Harris) guards the engine and once the rebellion controls the engine, they control their own lives. But Wilfords second-in-command Mason (Tilda Swinton, in another unusual, mannered, very good performance) tries to quell the rebellion in its early stages.

Bong was inspired to make this film when he found an out-of-print French graphic novel, prompting him to write the screenplay and direct the film. And it is the type of film that only a serious cinephile could create. Bong-Ho has created a unique, scary, challenging world and populated it with a distinct cast of characters, each of them different from the last, serving a purpose in both this society and the story. It is a fascinating look at a post-apocalyptic world.

The biggest change between the graphic novel and the actual film? Bong has cut down the number of cars in the train to twenty-six. This seems more manageable, but also less daunting. Curtis and his band have to make their way from the last car to the first, overcoming many obstacles along the way. In every other car, they experience a new challenge which serves to cause them to slow down and the resulting battle thins out the herd. Each car has a unique design and purpose for this micro-society, creating new challenges for the rebellion. It makes sense that Bong would reduce the number of cars, but we wouldnt expect to see every car anyway, and he doesnt even show every every one of the cars he does have, so I don't ultimately understand why he decided to do this.

As the film begins, you realize Bongs vision of this world is absolute. Every detail of the physical and mental has been created to reflect how and why they live like this. As they progress through the train, you see different environments and each of these reflects a different need for some part of the society. As the train is very much a class-based system, the last car houses the lower class. Here, the most people live in the poorest conditions, eating protein blocks, working hard, living in filthy conditions, bundled up against the cold. As they get closer to the front of the train, the upper classes have cars to cater to their every need, including a green house car to grow vegetables, an aquarium for their yearly sushi feast, a sauna car to provide relaxation and a nightclub car complete with dancing, alcohol and drug use.

In addition to the unique design of each car, the rebellion experiences new obstacles and challenges along the way. Each of these is highly stylized and you realize Bong also has a distinct vision for each of these battles. Early on, the rebellion meets a plethora of guards, cheered on by Mason (Swinton) at the other end of the car. Curtis and his followers think they have the upper hand until Mason gleefully orders the guards to put on their night-vision goggles. Namgoong looks out the large windows, squinting into the sunlight before he realizes they are about to enter a very long tunnel which will cut off their light. As darkness engulfs the car, the tunnel wiping away the light, the battle begins.

Snowpiercer is about as unique a vision as you can get in a movie these days. It is so absolute and finite, you cant help but get sucked into it. But this also represents my one minor complaint about the film. Because each train car represents a new obstacle, a new challenge, the narrative becomes a little too much like a film based on a video game. Can the hero overcome this obstacle to get to level 10? What new challenge will wait at level 11? But this is easy to overlook in a film filled with such unique ideas and designs.

Chris Evans plays Curtis, the leader of the rebellion and it is a remarkably good performance. You know there is something, some moment, driving him to lead this rebellion when so many before them have tried and failed. This has been eating at him for seventeen years and he literally cant take it anymore. So he watches, observes and formulates a plan with the help of Edgar (Bell) and Gilliam (Hurt). As word of their plan circulates, they attract more and more people who want to participate. When he reveals the reason he led the rebellion, you really feel his pain, years of regret building up.

Jamie Bell plays Edgar, Curtis friend and co-leader of the rebellion. He isn't as old as Curtis, and doesnt have the same history and he is more reluctantly willing to help. Octavia Specers Tanya becomes involved after her son is taken away. She wants him back and this provides her with the reason to participate. It is an unusual, but good performance for Spencer, who was attracted to the physicality of the role. John Hurt brings a welcome gravitas as Gilliam, the old man who is the rebellions wise sage. Hobbling around on one leg, Gilliam uses his age and wisdom to help steer the rebellions plan and ideas. The final piece of the puzzle comes with Namgoong. Once he is released from prison, Kang-ho Song imbues Namgoong with a lot of character. He is a smart guy, but he is also addicted to drugs and the rebellion uses this addiction to goad him on, forcing him to comply with their requests. He brings his daughter, Yona (Ah-sung Ko) who seems to have clairvoyant capabilities and also appears to be addicted to drugs. Just before they open each door, she ominously predicts what will happen in the next car. This is the type of cast, odd and disparate, that these days could only come from an independently made film.

Bong also creates the outer world with as much detail. As the train barrels along its tracks, the characters frequently look outside and we see different parts of the world and how they are affected by the Ice Age. Large ships are overturned and crusted with ice and snow. Buildings rise out of the ice, skeletons of their former glory. Because the train is speeding through a landscape covered in snow and ice, it will also encounter natural obstacles. When these occur, Bong shows us these in a way that doesnt give us a chance to breathe or prepare for it. They simply happen, making our hearts beat a little faster from the adrenaline.

Snowpiercer is a frightening look at a possible future, a dystopian future, created by a filmmaker with such a unique, uncompromising vision you cant help but go along for the ride.",1406246400,3,10825,4.664222105814563
6353573,5,B00JBBJJ4C,Wow! I loved this Film. Really. I cannot do this Film justice in a review. I Hope other viewers like it too. Best Luck & Hope Y'all Like it Too!,1406246400,,144,3.8333333333333335
6353574,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"It feels weird to say that, when all was said and done, Snowpiercer felt like the Hunger Games for adults, without the Reality TV overtones, shot like an extended hallway sequence from Oldboy (you know, the one where that guy kills all those people with a hammer) and an odd climax that reminded me of The Matrix.  Whats even weirder to me is the fact that this strange amalgam actually worked.  It is flawed, yes, and the more I reflect on those flaws the more they feel prominent, but I cant help but feel like Snowpiercer is one of those films well all look back on fondly in years to come; a film that will establish a justified cult following and will become this tentpole for future intelligent science fiction releases who want to deliver something unique and inspired to the audience.

With all the hoopla made over the trashy way that Weinstein Co. handled this distribution, I have to say that Im seriously baffled he didn't make a bigger deal of this film.  It has everything it needed to be a major blockbuster this year.  It has the reviews, the cast and the premise.  This is so much smarter than the barrage of senseless action flicks targeted at teenagers these days.  This has a political/social bite that makes it feel poignant, even when the plot holes are making the development of those themes feel somewhat incomplete.

But really, an apocalyptic action flick (because, this is pretty action packed, and the action is inspired and impressively shot) with a cast littered with box-office pulls (Evans, Swinton, Spencer, Harris and Bell all have their fan bases, but reallywe all know that Captain America himself could have carried this to impressive heights).

But enough about that.

Snowpiercer tells the story of Earths only surviving humans living together on a train that circles the Earth once every year.  The passengers are separated by class, with the wealthy living in luxury at the front of the train and the poor living like animals and in constant fear for their lives in the back.  Their children are taken from them without reason or warning, their food is disgusting and their numbers dwindle when the front of the train gets trigger happy and decides to even the playing field.  Among the needy, Curtis stands up as a beacon of hope.  Hes confident, cautious and strong willed, and he begins to lead his band of brothers to conquer the domineering leaders before them.  With a plan and a riot, Curtis pummels forth towards the front of the train and the mysterious leader, Wilford.

What transpires is a visual feast with layered subtext that works, mostly.

I think a major problem is the fact that, despite all the moments where it feels like the film is TELLING us what it has to say, the final moment feels almost barren.  That conclusion, while certainly breathtaking, feels like a lazy outing that didn't tie up the loose ends and winds up feeling anti-climactic despite the thunderous climax itself.

It says absolutely nothing, and so despite the film developing (or attempting to develop) so much within the body of the film, were left with a rather empty finale.

But the performances, the score, the technical merits (art direction, cinematography, etc.) are all spectacular, with Chris Evans finally proving hes more than a glorified super hero and Tilda Swinton creating such a bizarrely haunting character (although, this did feel like Effie Trinkets evil mother).  The films best performances came from Kang-ho Song and Ah-sung Ko, who embodied not only their characters but the film itself, creating a haunting depiction of desperation and intelligence trapped in a harrowing situation.

Despite a few flaws, Snowpiercer is a film that demands to be seen and dissected, discussed and debated; and that, to me, signifies a great movie.",1406246400,,3789,4.869158878504673

6353612,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"All in all a good movie, with Chris Evans in it, how could it not be? I still want to see him and Jason Bateman do a potty mouth comedy, like Jason's movie ""Bad Words"". That'd be a movie I'd pay to watch. Chris got to play a role he's familiar with, the hero, and he pulls through. Although I do have to say this, there's a couple lines in the movie that Chris speaks, that kinda make you shudder in horror. You'll know what I'm talking about when you hear them.

John Hurt, he's always, or at least as I've ever seen him as, a wise old mentor, and he does it so well. I'd like to watch some of his other movies, if anyone has a suggestion, please let me know.

Jamie Bell, liked him since Billy Elliot, another great movie. I've watched Jamie's career grow and am pleased, especially after he did ""The Eagle"", with Channing Tatum. If you like Jamie, or Tatum, or both, you have to watch it, they act great together and you hope for a sequel. Amazon has it on instant video. Jamie's character is good in this movie, he plays Chris's right hand man, another good pairing.

Tilda Swinson, I had no idea that was her until I just looked her up on Bing, what a great job!  She played such a sh***ty character that you hope she gets it in the end, or the front, or the side, just as long as she gets it.

All in all, a good movie, little gory in bits here and there, but you can't have a rebellion without a little blood and guts. Lots of action and character development, I was pleasantly pleased. There are three things in the movie that you don't see coming, a nice surprise. I like movies like that.

One thing though, you know what this movie needed, was Charles S. Dutton, THAT would've been an even better movie. I mean, c'mon, who doesn't like the strong, opinionated, charismatic, angry, mad at the system black man? Makes for a good movie every time.

Recommendation: On a scale of one to five, I give this a high four, good for entertainment, but the premise is a tad farfetched. Who eats bugs for 17 years, and not know?

I am here to tell you this is one dreadful movie. The one and only exception is Tilda Swinton,who is fabulous.  Other than that, there is nothing any good beyond the basic idea of income inequality set against the backdrop of global warming.

6353627,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"The basic premise of Snowpiercer is that in a post-apocalyptic future the remaining human survivors perpetually travel the world on a train segregated by class. As a literal idea it has plenty of maintenance problems but as a metaphor for life it works reasonably well, suggesting that as you move from one carriage to the next you progress up the social strata. Chris Evans is the leader of a rebellion that breaks out in the working class, tiring of cockroach cakes for food and poor treatment by the train's authorities.

First off, Chris Evans is a really excellent actor. In everything I've seen where he doesn't play a superhero (check out The Iceman), he excels at nuanced performances and he really is the linchpin of this film. John Hurt is good as always as an aging revolutionary accomplice, while most of the supporting cast are fine as the generic band of survivors. Tilda Swinton, another fine actor, plays an almost comic role that's a little odd for the tone but she nails it with a great northern English accent.

There are also plenty of annoying things about this film that don't quite work. From gunfights through the windows to the near-indestructible head henchman, it's full of details that are just wrong and set pieces that aren't executed nearly as well as they should be. The CGI is abysmal (trains and snow should be pretty easy at this point), the finale is signaled from a mile away, and ultimately the characters are too one-dimensional for it to carry the tone and message it's striving for.

Still, as a low budget sleeper sci-fi, it's actually much better than most of the recent blockbuster junk (oh, how I wish they'd renamed the film though I know that comes from source material). It has sparks of brilliance but not enough to make it a compelling movie you'd want to watch twice.",1406073600,,1818,4.728706624605678
6353628,2,B00JBBJJ4C,I think they had a good idea story wise but were either overly ambitious or just too lazy to do it right. I started to say the characters and actors playing them were good until I look back and see some HUGE flaws. For instance one character was supposed to have been born on the train but had a strong English accent. That's not so much the actors fault but the directors. Tilda Swinton was by far the highlight of the movie. She played her part with conviction and sold her character quite well. While the seven or so sets were done well enough they were simply lacking in quantity. Maybe I'm being too picky.

6353643,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer (Joon-ho Bong, 2013)

There are not that many filmmakers whose every movie is a guaranteed worthwhile time. Many of those have shuffled off this mortal coil (Kieslowski is an obvious choice) or retired (Bela Tarr). There are maybe a half-dozen I can think of with a sizable enough body of work to count (Amardeep Kaleka, for example, has only made one feature film, but man, what a film it is) and who have never put a single foot off the path. Joon-ho Bong is one of them. I've seen all five of his features (one of which, 2006's The Host, is as of this writing the highest-grossing Korean film of all time; Snowpiercer is currently 10th on that list, and Memories of Murder 38th) and one of his shorts, Influenza, and they're all good stuff. So I had high hopes for Bong's fifth film, Snowpiercer, his first in English. And then it got mired in distribution problems. There were rumors of large cuts being made (reportedly as much as a half-hour), fights with the distributor, all sorts of things that held it up. Finally, it came to a limited selection of theaters in America. Was it all worth it? Yes.

Curtis (Captain America's Chris Evans) is a tail-enderhe has spent the last seventeen years of his life in the rear car of Snowpiercer, a massive train that circles the globe once per year, running on a perpetual motion engine. After an attempt to control global warming in 2014 backfired, turning the Earth into a ball of uninhabitable ice, the only survivors were those who managed to board the train. They have been living there ever since, circling the globe over and over again, eventually separating into a hierarchythe upper classes at the front of the train and the lowest classes at the back. The tail-enders spend their lives munching protein blocks, not bathing, and imagining what life must be like for those at the front, but Curtis, with strong support from his best friend Edgar (Jumper's Jamie Bell) and mentor Gilliam (Alien's John Hurt), has decided that it's time to make things a little more egalitarian on the train. In order to do that, he must both free Namgoong Minsoo (Oldboy's Kang-ho Song) from the prison car and avoid Minister Mason (The Man from London's Tilda Swinton). And, of course, survive a miles-long journey with opposition at every turn and a rapidly-dwindling supply of enthusiastic, but not too martial, cohorts with makeshift weapons.

It should be obvious from that synopsis (and equally from the trailer, if you've seen it) that Bong, who co-adapted from the graphic novel with Kelly Masterson (Before the Devil Knows You're Dead), has a whole lot to say about classism. But it may not be what you think. Mason, in many of her scenes, harps on about the train's caste system; everyone has a place, and that's where they belong. But Curtis is a Horatio Alger hero from stem to stern; he wants to work his way up the ladder not just because he wants a place at the top, but because he believes Gilliam would be a better leader than Wilford (who is played by someone whose name I did not see revealed before I saw the film; that was one of its best surprises, so I'm not going to spoil it for you), who invented, and now runs, the train. Curtis is a man on a mission. But how much difference can one man and a cohort of assistants make, even in a strictly-controlled, closed ecosphere like the train?

Were this a fully-Hollywood production, directed by Michael Bay and produced by Roy Lee or something, the answer to that question would be a great deal. Curtis would go full Alger, the middle classes would line up behind him because they feel similarly oppressed, and Curtis would have a veritable army behind him for the inevitable final confrontation with Wilford, Mason, and the two terrifying, silent strongmen who are much of the power behind the throne (Police, Adjective's Vlad Invanov and Twice Born's Adnan Haskovic). Instead, as Curtis and his band make their way through the train, they discover that those above their station have been trained to look down on tail-enders their entire lives, and are more than happy to assist the upper classes in taking out the trash. Pieces of April's Alison Pill is both terrifying and hilarious as the train's schoolteacher, and wait till you get a load of Miroslav Navratil. (He's referred to in the credits only as Giant. That is not an exaggeration.)

But you don't want to know about all that. You want to know why this movie was produced by Chan-wook Park. And I will tell you exactly what you've been wanting to hear: yes, the fight in the water car does indeed outdo the infamous hallway battle in Oldboy. The film is not an action movie the way you're thinking of the term; there are long stretches of talking. (I like that sort of thing and even I thought a few of them could have been trimmed; to me, it was the movie's one failing.) But when there is action, Bong does it right. It's something he'd never done before, but with Park's hand guiding him, he did it very well.

The cinematography is hideously grimy through the first half of the film, and it's glorious. Towards the end it gets a little garish, but I think that was a conscious decision; you're seeing the cars through the eyes of the tail-enders, who have lived in squalor most (or in some cases all) their lives, so of course it's going to be garish. I thought it worked, anyway.

Another winner from Joon-ho Bong. If you haven't had the chance to see it yet, hope you get it soon. This is one that, I think, will lose something in translation to the small screen. See it as big as you can and marvel at it. ****",1405987200,,5599,4.598598598598598

6353663,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"This movie shines in the distopian future genre with a different take on the survivors at the end of the world.  The builder of the train, Mr. Wilford, is a brilliant visionary who knew that a climate change remedy was going to plunge the world into a global Ice Age.  He also displayed a passion for trains at an early age and built train tracks that circled the globe so the train takes exactly 365 days to make a complete circumference of the globe.  The interior of the train is a microcosm of humanity, from the poor to the rich, with cars that produce food for the different classes, process water from snow and ice, and groups that keep the classes separated so the balance works from year to year.  The movie takes place 18 years after the climate cataclysm and Chris Evans is the unwilling leader of the downtrodden with a plan to make it to the front of the train to take control and change the destinies for his friends in the back.  Tilda Swinton is amazing as Mason, the emissary from the front who spouts the party line on the brilliance and benevolence of Wilford and the train, without which everyone would be frozen.  The director has done an amazing job of creating the different sections of the train; schoolroom, conservatory, nightclub for the decadent, and more as the hero and his ragtag team move ever forward against horrible odds.",1405987200,2,1356,4.559670781893004

6353671,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Science-fiction films and television have made quite the re-emergence into pop culture over the past several years.  After decades of relative mediocrity (with only a sprinkling of gems to break the lull), blockbuster franchises like Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, and the superhero movie have once again revitalized the genre whilst paving the way for smaller, independent science fiction films that normally would not have made the cut, otherwise.

Snowpiercer is one such film Heralded as the best sci-fi film since Children of Men, this international contender had a lot to live up to.  Besides touching upon similar themes of the human condition, global warming and classism, it manages to create a wonderful balancing act between the three that keeps all of the aforementioned heavy topics spinning in perfect harmony.

Snowpiercer takes place in the near future where global warming has run rampant and begun heating the Earths service to disastrous results.  Humans (in their infinite wisdom) decide to create a chemical compound to counteract this phenomenon.  Inevitably, the humans create a chemical workaround and release it into the atmosphere, which counteracts the induced global warming.  The solution is short-lived, instead of leveling off at a normal global temperate the Earth continues to coolplummeting it into a new ice age.

Before the great freeze, a select few are herded onto a perpetual, everlasting train that serves as the last bastion of humanity Shielding them from the cold and providing food and comforts for the coming years, all seems well upon the Snowpiercer.  However, the people who live at the front of the train closest to the engine live a life of wealth and luxury, while the individuals who live in the tail live in near starvation and blatant poverty.

This leads to conflict.

The film takes place 18-years after the initial boarding of the train and follows a group of the tail section-ers, led by Curtis (Chris Evans) and Gilliam (John Hurt), as they try to change societys rules in order preserve their people.

Snowpiercer is a whirlwind of action and intrigue, the plot is less about the cause of the trains inception but rather the plight of its passengers.  It focuses upon the struggle of the impoverished as well as the decadence of the affluent.  The film is rich with symbolism  Specifically concerning synergy.  All parts affect the greater whole, especially in reference to the human body.  The head cannot exist without the feet and humans cannot exist solely, without humanity.  Numerous facets of the human condition and the aforementioned extended analogy permeate Snowpiercer, resulting in a complex film that keeps audiences thinking long after the credits roll.  Coupled with excellent acting Snowpiercer stacks up to be one of the best sci-fi films of the decade.

Chris Evans leads this star studded cast as the young leader (Curtis), hellbent on leading his people to a better future, John Hurt plays the aged leader (Gilliam) who is effectively passing the baton to Curtis, Jamie Bell plays Curtis lieutenant, Edgar, and the villains are rounded out by Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris.  Kang-ho Song and Ah-sung Ho round-out the cast as unlikely allies to the films protagonist.  All of the acting is in finest form, however, Kang-ho Songs acting stands out in particular because of his overall screen presence and difficult scenes.  Many of his lines are delivered in Korean, however this does not diminish any of the emotion or conveyance to the audience.

As an aside, Snowpiercer is a South Korean directed, written, and funded film and was expected to see a wide release United States via The Weinstein Company.  However, company head, Harvey Weinstein refused to distribute the film unless 20-minutes of the film were cut and introductory and closing monologues were added.  Director Bong Joon-ho politely declined, and the film only saw a limited release in art house theaters on June 27, 2014.  Due to the high amount of critical acclaim and buzz that Snowpiercer has received since its limited run, it was announced on July 2 that it would be run as a wide release in the near future.

This controversy is unfortunate, not because of the fact that it is a South Korean film, but rather the hoops that international films have to jump through to be seen  US film companies have such a monopoly and controlling stake in the market that quality films (such as Snowpiercer) get shoved to the bottom shelf, solely being shown in art house cinemas or digital streaming service.  In the case, it seems as-if the quality of the film out trumped the big film companies, so tip of the hat to critics who urged film-goers to give Snowpiercer a watch.

If you get a chance, I urge any science-fiction fan to watch Snowpiercer.  If you enjoyed Children of Men, youll love Snowpiercer.  The acting is superb, the plot is captivating and poignant, and to top it all off director Bong Joon-ho throws in enough bits of color, flair, and quirkiness to give the film a unique flavor without taking it to obscurity.",1405987200,,5071,4.977461447212337
6353672,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"This film got rave reviews from Entertainment Weekly and other film critics, and I understand why.

It seems anyone that has given this movie over 3 stars is either sniffing kronol, a magical industrial chemical byproduct of the train that will get humans high and is also highly explosive, or they are willing to buy into this bull crap of a plot. I get it. Humanity is the train. We all have to live together and in some manner and some will suffer while other will relish but come on. really? Seriously. This plot has so many loopholes I am beyond myself. There are too many to discuss on this amazon review. I am actually writing this review in hopes I save some people a few hours of their lives. DONT WATCH IT. If I change your mind please do the same and I think collectively we add up all the hours saved from this debacle we might you know actually cure something important.

So let me explain to you what this movie is. Its a high concept wanna be hunger games action movie wrapped in a Michael Moore plot. In Fact, just watch hunger games because its does what this movie could only wish. Yes the world is frozen because of humans and we see displaced humans in the back of the car which we must feel bad for because well... none of us reading these reviews are these people.  They want us to believe these people are the clogs (literately, and I don't mean figuratively this time) to make the entire train run. No matter the quality of production or cinematopher can save this bad idea. You can't wrap crap in a bow and expect us to accept it in fear of someone calling us dumb for not understand its meanings.

So now what? What else does this movie offer? You get to see Chris Evan walk through 10 train cars which couldn't exist in any laws of physics I know of to try and stop humanity from continuing to live the only way we know how.

The characters are generally parodies of themselves much the same way sin city paints archetypes and over the top illustrations of people.  I loved the story and the pacing was great.  If you stop to question how any of it could possibly make sense, you'll miss the point.  Treat it like a fantasy sci-fi comic and it's pure brilliance.

6353712,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"Honestly, being a sci-fi fan I had high hopes for this film considering there was such a broad spectrum of reviews on here. So here is my objective and honest opinion on this film. There is very little in the way character development and back story and in a science fiction based plot, you really need to give people a sense of what has transpired beforehand otherwise the whole concept is dumbfounding. You are left wondering through the whole movie what the hell is going on and toward the end they finally throw you a few unsubstantial pieces of information that still leave you scratching your head. The movie rely's too much upon big name actors carrying a bad plot along to a downright abysmal ending that has you seriously shaking your head at the end wondering if you could in any way justify the last 2 hours as something other than a waste of time. Truly a very unsubstantial movie that is lacking in just about every way that matters but if you honestly have nothing else to do go for it.",1405900800,2,1000,4.469945355191257

6353722,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"This movie was done well considering there was little marketing. Love the direct VOD word of mouth buzz that puts out a nice piece of work like this movie. Based on a French Graphic Novel set in a post apocalyptic world frozen by a weather modification chemical gone awry. The last survivors of earth live on a train that traverses around the world and has been doing so for 17 years.  The prophetic creator of the engine, Wilfred, knew the climate altering chemicals would lead to an ice age, so he built the train as a kind of ARC. The movie is exciting for the most part and you do get a little of Captain America showing of his signature fighting moves--without the shield.  It is different from the graphic novel.  In the movie our protagonist Chris Evans, who lives at the back of the train where the inhabitants live in an early post-war WWII Europe type bleakness, leads a band of rebels to the front of the train to overthrow Wilfred. In the the book our protagonist just wants to see what its like at the front and there are like 1001 cars or something. This is not indicated in movie which make successful revolt less plausible.  There is a social stratification going on in the graphic novel but better to read to see the differences.  As a commentary of on climate change and social injustice it makes its point. The is a movie worth watching at home or in the theater. The very end does drag on a bit with much unnecessary slow motion walking /fighting and exposition.",1405900800,,1482,4.474074074074074

6353736,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"***No spoilers here***
Best sci-fi movie I have seen in quite some time.  Moves quickly but beautifully.  The score is incredible and obviously carefully chosen and the choreography in some of the more action packed scenes was remarkable and beautiful and yet those same scenes were still gritty and harsh.  The story mirrors current societal themes rather well with regard to the one percent (although on the train it seemed more like the more than 50%).  It was exciting and scary and kept me riveted the whole way through.

*****SPOILERS.  Do not read if you have not seen this movie.*****
The only thing that would have made it better was a decent antagonist who tugged at your heart.  Here, the antagonist was simple and flat.  You just didn't side with him in the least.  ""Just kill him and get him to shut up"" is how I felt the whole time he was on screen.  And I do love Ed Harris as an actor.  I just wish he was a little more than one dimensional in this role.  Just wish I had mixed feelings there.  Love him a little, hate him a little.  Do I want him to fail or do I happen to side with him just a little.  Those are the villains that stick with me.  Like Moriarty in the series Sherlock.  Now that is a villain that I don't want to see off the screen.  Funny, clever, maniacal.  Show me more.  As much as I love Ed Harris, his character was all kinds of 'rich boring bad guy who doesn't care about the existence/survival of the lower class' and that just isn't someone I want to listen to or watch for more than a few moments before he meets his maker.

*****SPOILERS.  Do not read if you have not seen this movie.*****
Also, some of the deaths were just a little too fast and too timed.  Someone major dies in this scene.  Someone major in the next.  And so on til the very end where two humans and a bear are all that exists in the world as we know it.

***No spoilers here***
Other than that, I absolutely loved this movie.  I can't remember another sci fi movie I have seen lately that I enjoyed as much.  I would wrap this movie up in a bow that says 'gritty, real, with moments of elegant beauty, and oddly enough those moments were fights scenes' and if that appeals to you, see it.",1405814400,,2203,4.256038647342995
6353737,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"I can't remember if I've ever disliked a movie as much as I do this one.  It started off fairly decent.  There seemed to be a plot, there was action, and the lead actor (I'm sorry but I don't know his name) was likeable.  His character was strong & determined.  But somewhere along the way the writer lost his focus!  Because, to me, it all fell apart!  The story was ALL OVER the charts!  A train that was the life source of humanity?  The head car was THE very heart of it.  The lead actor's character was leading a revolution to gain control but again, somehow the revolution fell apart!  There were parts of the ""story"" that just appeared out of no where!  It was AWFUL!  Maybe there's supposed to be some kind of underlying meaning, a lesson to learn, I don't know.  This movie seemed to be hastily thrown together with bits and pieces of action, drama, some mind altering drugs, and an ending that the writer and/or producer simply walked away from.  Bottom line?  It's up to you, but I WOULD NOT waste my money or time on this ""movie"".",1405814400,6,1042,4.354166666666667

6353739,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Absolutley fantastic movie. If this movie had simply attempted to make a plot-driven Sci-Fi/Action film then this would make the movie a good movie, nearing on 'great' and definitely worth watching.  However, it is the numerous themes and messages and ultimately calls to action and confronting realities of our current global culture (presently and in the future) make this a fantastic film with so much substance (despite the incredible importance of its messages, it seems to never take itself too seriously and recognizes the absurdity that it is a film about the world on a non-stop train. However, that does not detract from the messages themselves).  The move is full of metaphors, symbols and deeper meanings at nearly every level of dialogue, character, behavior and atmosphere. Some are so blatant they're basically spelled out for you while others are a little more subtle and a few very subtle or more covert in their place in the films context and thus message.  I enjoyed the ride. There was great action and characters with a very unique Sci-Fi plot that keeps you entertained but yet constantly thinking and enjoying picking up on and pondering further the subtle social critiques that movie is not short on as they cover a vast array of very important social issues that demand attention and, according to Snowpiercer.......well, I don't want to say to much. This is a movie that has left me with a lot of thoughts (rare of movies these days, especially with Blockbuster actors) while, in doing so, it never felt full of itself for how good, or clever or significant it is to the world as other movies and its actors or directors have done with the messages in their films. ""Snowpiercer"" never seems to shout ""this will save the world!"" but takes a more pragmatic look at issues and itself even. Its an action film and an activist film but not one that falls into the ""over the top"" genres and various action movies (think Transporter 3 or Micheal Moore for examples) though the Sci-Fi aspect can feeel that way but how else is Sci-Fi supposed to be? This is much more of Anyways, this movie is fantastic and really gives you a lot to digest. I'm looking forward to watching it again as this seems to be a movie where there's even more symbolism and meaning hiding that one misses on first glance.",1405814400,,2314,4.751243781094527
6353740,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"I watched the much rumored Harvey Weinstein's  US version. And, this review is for the American (shortened?) version.

I watched it twice, loved the spectacular actors that allowed me to soak into the story. The second time watching it, the movie still comes to me very fresh.

Although I find the ending of the plot being too hopeful and too abrupt to break out of the train to expect the (better) future and the message being a different world for the younger survivors, from the sacrifice of the leaders to be worthy,

I did still notice clearly all the hard works of the entire production, and the star-struck casting  and the direction are Bravo! I find
Tilda Swinson, Chris Evans, Song, Kang-ho all equally charismatic in a very original way.

If you can see the different layers of how things are told, you will definitely enjoy and even respect the work being done.
I just wonder whether the European/Asian Versions are much better.

6353792,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"I paid good money to see this one! It is my hope that I post this review early enough to spare the rest of you.

This highly acclaimed movie, written and directed by award-winning Joon-ho Bong (""The Host"" and ""Mother"") has accumulated accolades enough to convince me that I was silly to avoid it. To make things worse, I talked a friend into going with me!

We are on a speeding train that has been screeching through an icy terrain for 18 years (!), ever since chemicals were used during the course of a global-warming experiment which destroyed Earth's climate. It is now eternal winter. The people in the back end of the train are filthy, diseased, missing limbs and semi-starved. Any children they might have are taken from them. Eventually, we learn that the people in the forward part of the train live singularly different lives of ease and abundance. It takes regularly scheduled intervals of violence to maintain this balance.

We cringed with:
  * Chris Evans (""What's Your Number?"") who needs to wash his face and go back to being Captain America! His character is thinking seriously about a revolt.
  * Jamie Bell (""The Adventures of Tintin"") is another young man who considers a rebellion.
  * Kang-ho Song (""The Host"") seems to know a lot about what's going on but his main concern seems to be his daughter. He has been in suspended animation (don't ask).
  * John Hurt (""Hercules"") is a one-legged elder statesman to the people in the rear of the train. Everyone looks up to him even though he is as filthy and deprived as the rest.
  * Octavia Spencer (""Fruitvale Station"") Her little boy was taken from her, so she doesn't have to think twice when it comes to a revolution.
  * Tilda Swinton (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") is deliciously villainous, so for me, one of the few high points of this film was when she bit the big one!
  * Ed Harris (""Gravity"" voice) When he appears, the end is in sight. Take hope!

Post-apocalyptic worlds are so clichd by now. I hope a new trend starts soon. This is an R-rated actioner, so expect most scenes to be muddy, depressing and violent (hatchets anyone?). There is very little profanity but gunshots by the score. Expect only one explosion, but it's a dandy!

6353802,1,B00JBBJJ4C,"Really boring pastiche of something akin to Terry Gilliam's movie. ( I would wait for Gilliam's movie Zero Theorem -august). As many reviewers of the 5-star ilk and the 1-star back passenger ilk have commented with such distinctive polarity, the  movie is a dark dystopian movie with no real climax, more of a dark and ugly anti-climax which leaves the viewer feeling cheated at the end.

It is a man's journey from the very dark abyss of becoming a savage by eating babies to the front of the train, to see some maniacal 'god-king' who callously and tirelessly espouses some mind-numbing philosophy of the have and have-not and his brain-numbing justifications how he is allowed to live in luxury, while the other half of humanity are starving to death.

I think, many people have heard of this nonsensical diatribe about why tyrant and kings live the way they do...this Korean director seems to be mocking the North Korean dictator and most of the viewers here who rated it a 5-stars are awestruck with this revelation. Just google how North Koreans people are eating dead corpses and buried bodies due to starvation...this is happening now in North Korea, you don't need to see a slick movie to visualize such incredible brutality occurring even today.",1405728000,5,1255,4.882629107981221

Chris Evans evoked many feelings of Christian Bale throughout his performance. Most of the cast brought vivid characters to life. The movie does leave you with lots of questions and wanting more of the brought up questions answered.

I was left guessing the whole way through.  The story was great and the action was fast and well done.  The last 20 mins of the movie had me to the point of wanting to yell and cry at the same time.  I can't wait to see what is going to come next from this director he did a masterful job.  This movie proves that there is a lot more to Chris Evans than just Capt America.

6353817,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Solid movie making no matter the country which produced it. Chris Evans showed that he might actually be able to do something beyond Captain America kiddie movies. That is not meant as criticism of his performance in this movie. His performance in this movie was exactly what it needed to be. He didn't portray a hero or an anti-hero; he simply portrayed a man with a terrible conscience, who wanted to make amends for the atrocities he had committed. I highly recommend this movie for acting, directing, staging and a movie with a message. The movie does not falter; in fact, it is well paced between action and reflective moments. However, it is gritty. It is not pretty; almost appearing black and white sometimes with subdued colours throughout until they escape the ghetto part of the train. The only part of the movie which could have been reworked was the exposition at the end; wherein the villain, not really a villain but mad nevertheless, explains his reasoning for the living conditions he set up for the survivors of the big freeze. Simply, this exposition was not necessary. It could have been omitted and still not have reduced the movie to a simple mindless actioner. The message comes through loud and clear. The message I took away is that mankind's solutions to the problems of survival often, if not mostly, create bigger problems. It is a solid and entertaining movie with something to show us about our choices--particularly those choices relating to individual and group survival. We have to choose our solutions to our problems better; for if we don't, it won't be our problems which kill us off it will be our solutions to those problems which bring about our extinction.",1405641600,2,1696,4.831615120274914

6353831,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"I enjoyed this movie. I appreciate that it did not have exceeding gore. It did have some fight scenes and some injuries shown but not as bad as most films that depict fights. It seems that there was not as much cursing in this movie compared to most. The aspect I enjoyed most about this movie were the analogies or parables which seem to attempt to explain how things are (or might be) in real life. The ending is good but definitely a big surprise. If you like mysteries you might like this. After seeing the ending I watched this a second time to see if I would have been able to guess what happened. I very skilled mystery movie watcher (and guesser) might be able to figure out the ending before seeing it. The movie doesn't use cheap tricks to twist the plot, you could have actually guessed the ending. However, even after watching it a second time I did have a hard time believing one character's relationship or friendship with another one. It seemed there was a bit of a contradiction or maybe there just was not enough screen time devoted to explaining the situation, or maybe I just interpreted it wrong. I will make a list below about the interesting things I saw while watching the movie (SPOILERS, please don't read below if you don't want to see spoilers):

1. It is very interesting how the scientists screwed up the planet with CW7 while professing to help, but yet Wilford knew what was going to happen and had the money to make the train. People on the train are told that all life is extinct outside the train and that life cannot exist outside the train, but at the end of the move we see a polar bear. That is very Ironic that it was a Polar Bear.

2. The number 17 is a very important and reoccurring number in this movie. Curtis says in the movie he was on the earth for 17 years, then on the train for 17 years. He says this while it was the 17th year of the train. Yona, who he was talking to, says she was 17 years old (this is still in the same scene). She was born on the train. And, most interestingly, the name Yonah (some spell it Yona) in Hebrew sounds the same as her name. The Hebrew name Yonah is spelled  and if you add up the value (each Hebrew letter has a number value) of those Hebrew letters it equals 71.   10  6  50  5  .
71 backwards is 17. During the movie the 18th year of the train is announced.

3. In the movie, the train started its mission in 2014 and the movie takes place in 2031.

4. The people on the train are all forced (or allowed) into class systems which are ruled by martial law. Everyone depends on Wilford (and the train) and even he depends on the train. when horrible things are done it is done for 'the greater good' of the ""sacred engine"" or the people on the ""whole wide  train"".

5. One of the mysteries in the movie is what the protein bars are made of. This reminded me of Soylent Green, even before they showed in the movie what it was made of. I like to call it Soylent Black (its not made of people as far as I know).

6. A shoe was thrown at (this is an insult in some cultures) one of the high up officials (her name is Mason) who was wearing purple (a color of royalty). Mason is a name that could remind us of the Freemason society.

7. I find it Ironic that the drug of the train is both an industrial waste and also explosive. This makes more sense near the end of the movie but the movie doesn't explain where it comes from. It has a bad reputation on the train just like drugs do in real life.

8. The fish blood ritual seems to have deeper meaning but it is never explained in the movie. In real life there has been cultures or religions that use rituals with fish guts and or other parts. In this scene, Mason enjoys seeing the slaughter of the fighting.

9. All three of the named revolts on the train were allowed by Wilford in order to keep population levels controlled.

10. Gillian who leads the back end (poor section) of the train was working together with Wilford who ran the train. After watching this movie a second time, it still seems like Gillian wanted to really overthrow Wilford.

11. The number 18 is another reoccurring number in the movie. The train passes into its 18th year during the movie, and then during the punishment of 74% of the population being killed, 18 were spared.

12. In Hebrew, vowels are not considered letters, there is only dots or punctuation type markings which represent vowels. People often write Hebrew without vowels. If we write the hero's name (Curtis Everet) in Hebrew while ignoring the vowels, it could be written as   
there is no word in Hebrew that I know of for  but there is a very important word . This last spelling would be accurate if his name was Curt. Technically,  is a word but its more proper spelling is  . So I believe the best way to represent his name in Hebrew is   .

 means Hebrew, the language.
So, this could mean several things. ""he makes a Hebrew language covenant"". ""He cuts Hebrew (as in words)"".  supposedly is a word for body guards or executioners. so maybe I am wrong and it refers to that. In that sense it could be ""Guards of Hebrew"" or ""cutters of Hebrew (the language)"".

13. The pattern on the door to the engine (not the first car room door with the W on it)opens in a very interesting way, and the dots on the door are in some kind of pattern. I have no idea what these patterns mean if anything, but considering the tricks in the credits list, there might be something to this engine door pattern.

14. During the credits, some of the letters disappear and some do not, while they transition to another list of names or credits. Sometimes some letters disappear, then a few remain, and then one letter MOVES on the screen either to the left or right. This is the kind of thing that makes me think the Yona and Curtis names actually had meaning to them.",1405555200,,5905,4.281474820143885

6353839,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"Another serving of post-Apocalyptic twaddle. This time Mankind devolves on a...wait for it...train! WOW! What a great metaphor for all the societal decay we've come to expect from exercises in excess such as this 2 hour-plus waste of my time. This concept was done much better in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Plus, you got to see Tina Turner in a slinky chainmail evening gown instead of Ed Harris in a bathrobe, spouting nonsense on what appears to be a set from a Mexican game show. It features an ""international"" cast. That means you don't know most of them and the rest you will need closed captioning to understand. Not to worry though, the characters are so cliche and trite you already know their dialogue: The reluctant and ""troubled"" Leader; the young rebel that the Leader seems to care deeply about (but not like THAT!); the elderly and wise Father-I-Never-Had to the Leader, that always has the right bit of cliched wisdom to dispense; the ""feisty"" black woman; the feral yet adorable children; leering and ever-so-evil henchmen in nicely pressed suits, (""Excuse me. Where's the Dry Cleaning Car?""); a mob of ax-wielding, balaclava-wearing maniacs with a car all to themselves?; And how about the Sea World car, huh? We'll discuss the problems of that later. At about the hour and a half mark, I ""paused"" this marathon and wandered off for a while. Not to worry. There was still lots of yapping and unlikely scenes yet to come. This movie should have been cut w-a-a-a-y down and even then I doubt if it would have made any more sense. Save your money. This will be a cable ""exclusive"" in no time.

6353841,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"To be honest I don't know what to think of this film.  It looks good and holds your attention most of the way, but somehow this runaway train got derailed at some point and never really recovered.  You would never recognize Tilda Swindon.  Even Chris Evans looks stripped down and barely recognizable until he gets rid of his skull cap half way through.  Maybe that was the mistake?

The basic problem is that there is nothing new here.  The train as metaphor has been done so many times that you really have to come up with something inventive.  Instead, we get a deadly earnest cinematic version of the graphic novel with only the sardonic note of Ed Harris as the mad genius behind this perpetual motion train that can only keep a tightly controlled number of persons alive for an indefinite period of time on a frozen earth.  The other problem is understanding the purpose of having all those stowaways on board.  Is it just to fulfill Wilford's sense of the human pyramid, or to pluck the occasional five-year old for some undisclosed purpose until the end?  This train is definitely going nowhere, and the only redeeming character is Song Kang-ho as he opens the doors from one train car to the next on this long journey.

I think the story would have worked better if the Utopian vision of Wilford had decayed over the course of 18 years and now everyone was fighting for their survival, rather than this revolt from the back of the train, and that Wilford basically has lied to them that no one can live outside the train.  It needed more of a dark comic angle, like A Boy and His Dog, to drive a story like this, because it is very hard to take this scenario seriously.",1405555200,6,1678,4.5016501650165015

What is sustainable about this train? Don't ask about the ending because there is no logic or resolution. We can't even be sure who survives the final confrontation/calamity. I can't remember a film which left me so uncertain as to who even survives? Good acting, good concept but we are left hanging with a lot of unanswered questions. I can't imagine what the movie would have been like if Weinstein managed to force cutting 20 minutes. It would have made even less sense. Younger audiences who want lots of blood and gore and cynicism might like it, I don't even though the acting was excellent. Science fiction premises have to have some degree of believability and this one does not. The politics of the film is also muddy. We are supposed to be on the side of the minions oppressed at the end of the train, but by the time we work our way forwards, it is not at all clear who is who in this struggle.",1405468800,,1061,4.446153846153846

6353852,2,B00JBBJJ4C,"My interest in this film began to wane when the monologues and long soulful stares into space began.  While the initial concept of this film had possibilities, the further it progressed, the more those initial possibilities began to slip away until we were left with...nothing.
So what was it all about?  Class warfare?  Dictatorship?  Survival of the fittest?  Who knows.  I think even the director lost sight of what he was attempting to portray.  As a ""sci-fi"" film, too many of the concepts applied left too many questions unanswered.  Even if we accept that the developer of ""the train"" was able to foresee the future and produce a maintenance free, world wide railway line that could withstand the harshest elements.  Even if he was able to produce a ""perpetual motion"" engine to run this train on that railway line, why did he have to rely on children of a specific size to manually ""grease the cogs""?  I think an attempt to answer that question was hidden away in one of the lengthy monologues, but by that time I had lost all interest in trying to understand what it was all about
Other reviewers have sung the praise of the directors efforts.  Even others have praised his previous works but ""canned"" this one.

The effects and pacing are both good; I don't remember waiting for any of the scenes to be over.

There are some things that didn't make sense to me - why does the invading party shed all of its members in the various night clubs and spa cars, leaving the main characters alone and totally unsupported when they get to the front?

The train (like Bioshock's Rapture or Wool's Silo) is a self-contained, Dystopian creation meant to ensure mankind's survival in a man-made ice age. No one enters or leaves the train. This film relies heavily on striking imagery. It is very well-made, tells a great story, and really keeps you immersed. Without spoilers, I will say that in my opinion the movie sort of starts to fall apart towards the end. While I personally did not care for the ending, most reviewers loved it so there you go. Regardless of the ending, the movie itself still makes the journey worthwhile.  If you like science fiction and want some counter-programming to relentless remakes and reboots, this movie is a nice change of pace.

Don't be fooled into believing the movie must be a ""straight to video"" B movie. It is not.

Its the same old class struggle of rich and poor, and one unlikely bad-boy character now rises to be the savior.

 The scenes didn't  hold much suspense, and some of the subplots fell flat. Overall the film was not worth the money especially considering that the image quality was horrible. Also the special effects was not very good.",1405382400,3,759,4.309859154929577

Snowpiercer makes James Bond movies look realistic.  For some reason, people at the end of the train are kept alive solely to eat bars made out of cockroaches.  Late in the film we learn that these people originally were cannibals because they were given no food or water.  These people are not slaves.  They do no labor.  But they decide to move to the front of the train.  So the movie is about a few characters, who of course gradually get killed off, moving from one train car to the next.  It's the same racially diverse cast as Alien, and of course, the white man is the central character. The villain is also white male.  OK, let's say you don't care about racial diversity, plot, or characters.  You are fine with cliched scenes, slowmo, and so on.  All you care about is special effects and action scenes.  But even on this score the film fails.  The CGI looks like terrible.  The action scenes are totally derivative and predictable.  And the film gets talkier and talkier as it approaches the end.  The two main characters, one good and one bad, give pointless ""deep"" monologues, separated only by a silly fight between the two man good characters.  It really fails when Ed Harris's character (the mastermind Hobbesian villain) comes on even though I think Harris is an incredible actor.  (Chris Evans, not so much.)  But even Harris can't redeem this film and its pseudo deep Hobbesian view of life as nasty, brutish, and short, destined to go in circles and in line led by a dictator train engineer.

Uh huh. But it's so fun and often funny that if you're a sci-fi geek you can easily get sucked in and just enjoy the ride. It looks fantastic, and except for the stone-faced Evans, trying to look all serious and action hero, the cast is marvelous -- Tilda Swinton especially is hilarious. Boy has she been on a roll lately.

6353921,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Overall I really liked the movie. I especially like the option to watch this movie while it's still in theaters :) (Very minor spoilers below)

Likes:
I thought the premise we pretty good, we mess up the climate and in trying to fix it make it much worse. I liked the class distinctions and the conflict that arises from the ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" (front vs rear of the train). The cinematography in portions of the movie were really well done. The pace of the movie was good and always felt like it was moving forward. There have been several movies/books recently with a similar theme (world ends, survivors hide out for decades, technology degrades over time, is it safe to go out yet) but this one felt a little different perhaps because of the confinement of the train.

Dislikes:
Of all the ways to survive the planet freezing I thought people boarding a train that circles the globe is pretty much the worst idea. I didn't like the handling of the reveal at the end of the movie. It very much felt like the scene in the second Matrix movie where Neo meets the architect, which I (and most of the planet) didn't like.

Honestly, for anybody that has read even a few pages of the original Graphic Novel and expected something even remotely resembling it with this movie, don't waste your money or your time on this utter piece of crap. If you do watch this movie, you will only find that  Snowpiercer got remade into the Hunger Games on wheels. That being said, I can only blame myself in here, for I definitively should've known better than to expect anything else from this movie. When you see that the current edition of the Snowpiercer graphic novels have the statement ""The Graphic Novel that Inspired the film"" written at the top of the book, you should know that the director of the film took some slight ""hollywood-like"" liberties with the material at hand.

6353934,3,B00JBBJJ4C,"I liked the movie until the last 15 minutes.... VERY disappointing ending.... There were so many ways that they could have wrapped it up but the chosen way felt as if they just didn't care anymore and wanted something way too ""dreamy"".... if people are to survive or be doomed, let them be.  The movie was trying to be honest up until that point.  All in all... it was ok.  I would not even really consider watching again.",1405209600,4,422,4.384615384615385
6353935,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Right off the bat, one has to dismiss many obvious questions when watching an allegory like Snowpiercer.  If they could build a perpetually running engine to power a train, why didn't they build more of them (and use them to power underground shelters to boot)?  Who is performing track maintenance if nobody is left on Earth?  And where do they get all those bugs? (I won't spoil the scene!)

But accurate science isn't the point of this movie.  In fact, you already know the three main themes of this movie just by watching the trailer: Rigid society class stratification never works, absolute power for the ruling elite always ends badly, and society can become a machine from which there is no escape.

Science fiction loves to tackle these points with varying degrees of success, though Snowpiercer does so in a mostly non-political way.  By this I mean that it doesn't hit the viewer over the head with its ideology in the way a film like Elysium does.

The movie resembles a Terry Gilliam dystopian future in many ways - the modern steampunk-ish look, the juxtaposition between lower and upper classes when they cross paths, pointing out the lunacy of doing something a certain way because that's how it's always been done.

This resemblance brings me to the third major theme of the movie - people being trapped in the machine of society no matter what class they hail from or how fluid the movement between those classes is and how they try to change the `machine' from the inside.

This theme is a much harder one to pull off successfully in a film.  And on first glance, one would guess that Snowpiercer wouldn't be a good example because of the heavy handed nature of literally being stuck in a machine (the train) trying to change society from the inside.  However, movies are often about the journey, not the destination.  And though you'll likely foresee the last part of the movie about halfway through, it's still a good trip getting there.

There's a lot of science and technology nitpicks to make, but looking past them to solid acting from a good cast (Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton, John Hurt, and Song Kang-ho), the film works even through its absurd parts.

From a descriptive perspective, there's a lot of violence but it isn't overly gory - you'll see blood but they don't show gaping wounds, entrails, etc.  There's some cursing including an F bomb or two if I remember right but it's not pervasive.  Though I loved the scenes of frozen cities and other remnants of society, they weren't groundbreaking in any way.  The special effects are good but not A+ material (think Riddick level FX rather than Marvel's The Avengers level).",1405209600,,2653,4.742919389978214

A friend told me about this movie and after watching the trailer I was very interested. This was one of the best post apocalyptic movies I have seen in a long while. I just loved it.

The style of movie and cinematography may not be for everyone. SOME of the scenes kinda/sorta reminded me of a Terry Gilliam type, 12 Monkeys/Brazil ""off"" style.

Poorly written, predictable, gimmick laden, and littered with obvious bro-dude ""Hell-yeah"" moments, I just cannot believe the good ratings!! My guess is there was an effort made en masse to write fake good reviews, because I cannot see people on such scale liking this movie.

SPOILERS:

The basis of the movie is ""People at the crap end of the train want better treatment so they rebel"" and a journey ensues to the front of the train to take control, lead by Chris Evans.

BUT! Before that we are treated to gimmicky train car after another. Oh man they've all been eating roaches, ewww (who cares!!) OOoooh look, a train car full of frozen chickens! What would logically come after that? Oh, the school car of course! Complete with kooky pregnant teacher who will eventually shoot everyone with guns delivered in a boiled egg cart! How zany! Afterwards there is car after car of ridiculous ""upper crust"" behaviors. There's a pool car, and a rave car, and a ""sit around and be drugged out"" car. And finally, after all this nonsense, we get to the ""final door"" that will take Chris Evans to his goal. But wait! The guy who was supposed to open the door doesn't want to! So Chris Evans goes on a long. LOOOOOOOONG tearful story of his early days on the train. Apparently he ate tasty babies (and tells us in detail how it happened, because garsh, we the audience like to be shocked by gruesome baby death stories these days [here's looking at you Game of Thrones! Don't worry, you're still great GoT!])  Then he goes on to cry about how he couldn't cut off his arm back in the day or something and he's really upset about it. Then comes the final meeting between the train maker and Chris Evans. The villain then begins a loooong monologue, tells Christ Evans he wants him to be his heir (so this whole movie was basically a really dumb post apocalyptic Willy Wonka), and right before Chris Evans goes along with it, he sees that little kids (under 5) are being used as ""parts"" to fix up the train, including the kids he high-fived at the beginning! Noooooo! He then sees that to get this kid out of the train gears, SOMETHING must stop those gears before the child could be pulled up! Hmmm... there's a table leg and chair leg made of metal nearby that could be stuck into the gears.... NAW! Chris Evans uses his ARM to stop those gears! And now he's gone full circle from the new information we just got about his sadness over not cutting off his arm long ago, to cutting off his arm (for no reason!) now.

Finally, there is a massive explosion, the train derails and apparently every single person dies onboard, except for the kid and the daughter of the door guy from earlier. They wander out from the burning wreckage together and see a Polar Bear on the horizon. THE END!!!!!!

Truly, I wanted to  like this movie. The good reviews took me off guard so I plunked down the money to see this, but I am severely regretting it. I love LOVE that they made a movie from a Graphic Novel, and I could honestly see it working in that format, but the movie, because of all the kooky, zany, gimmicky additions, really just felt.... dumb. I think a different filmmaker could have told the story so that we could feel awe, mystery, and sadness instead of ""OOOOoooh Bro, they were eating ROACHES!"".",1405123200,15,3365,4.479608482871126
6353948,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Out of all the movies I've seen so far in 2014, this is no doubt the best. Just about the only thing this movie does that is not original is that in the future the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland. But nearly everything feels truly new.

One thing I love is the fact that the movie is like one big social commentary, yet it doesn't come off as pretentious. It basically shows how humanity is destroying itself at every turn and that if we continue along our set path of strict caste systems delegated by forms of spiritual beliefs and reckless disregard for our environment that we are essentially doomed (to an certain extent).

I feel really bad that this movie was given such an atrocious release. The movie was perfect as is and I'm certainly glad the director did not cut out any material. Just glad I can help show support for a movie and director with a unique style that should be seen by all.

This is a movie that would appear to be a straight up action sci-fi like Edge of Tomorrow, but ends up being so much more complex.

If you can get beyond the main conceit (the world has froze and only this train remains) then you will not only have a good time and something to think about--but you are surprised this was released as summer blockbuster fare.  Chris Evans never really gets beyond Steve Rogers (Captain America) in an alternate universe, and John Hurt pretty much plays the same old Doctor Who role he has mined for 20 years now, but it was great to see a lot of modern working actors get some play as well (Jamie Bell, Alison Pill, Octavia Spencer).  Yes, and Tilda Swinton chews the scenery with big false teeth.

I need a lot more time to process what I've just seen.  It certainly owes a lot to Terry Gilliam, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Peter Greenaway--but this is certainly a Joon-ho Bong movie right up to the (un)happy ending.",1405123200,,1106,4.41871921182266

It is a mediocre story with mediocre action and yes, a mediocre ending. How the upper class lives on the train is totally far fetched. So unbelievable it really detracts from the movie. A majority of them looked/acted like the houseguests on ""Rocky Horror.""

6353952,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"After a disastrous bid to reverse climate change submerges Earth into a new ice age, the few remaining human survivors board a vast, perpetual-motion-powered locomotive.  Almost two decades later, the still-moving train is defined by rigid social division.  The destitute, the ill, and the undernourished live in squalor in the crowded rear cars while others, including enigmatic engineer and inventor Wilford, thrive and even indulge at the front.  Desire for revolution, however, is rapidly growing as reluctant hero Curtis, played in a career-best performance by Captain America star Chris Evans, plots to travel by force through the train and gain by force the ultimate bargaining chip:  control of the sacred engine.  Snowpiercer is an exciting, intoxicating, and truly original science-fiction vision and a potent cinematic experience.  It wears its political and social conscious on its sleeve, and this may frustrate certain viewers, but I found its earnest agitation persuasive.  The worst I can say of the film is it does not always navigate tonal shifts (from absurd action to satiric humor to brutal tragedy) with as much ease and grace as it should, but this is a minor qualm in relation to the literal trainload of frights, joys, pleasures, and surprises awaiting viewers.

Despite the inherent claustrophobia of the train, the world of the film has a complicated and enormous quality with a new horror or wonder awaiting Curtis and his ever-diminishing squad of conspirators each time they open another door.  From the scorched, filth-encrusted metal nightmare which is the rear cars to the aquariums and nightclubs at the front, the art direction is triumphant throughout and a key star of the film.  Which is not to discredit or underplay the contribution of an enviable international cast.  Evans has never delivered a more intense or serious performance; a third-act monologue which finds him reflecting on past crimes and haunting sights is vividly delivered.  And Tilda Swinton is a perverse delight as a nervous, whining, peculiar-to-the-core political minister who becomes a hostage of the rebels'.  This is the type of high-wire, entirely unique character performance for which she is so cherished.  Everyone else is at the very least convincing and many contribute their own brand of intensity or idiosyncrasy to the enterprise; they range from Jamie Bell to Ed Harris to South Korean star Song Kang-ho to a delirious Alison Pill as a demented, propaganda-sharing schoolteacher in one hilarious sequence.",1405123200,3,2529,5.305764411027569

6353954,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Joon Ho-Bong returns with a memorable (and one of the most expensive films produced by a South Korean studio)science fiction allegory. ""Snowpiercer"" is set in a post-apocalpytic world where the last surviving members of humanity ride a massive train. This advanced train represents a microcosm of the world they left behind--each car has people representing different economic classes. Bong's film works best as an allegory for our current society but also manages to be an entertaining ride.

SPOILERS:

Revolution is in the air when Curtis (Chris Evans) decides that the people living at the end of the train have had enough of being treated like cattle and fed with protein bars. Curtis has a plan that will take him to the front of the train where, he believes, Gilliam (John Hurt) will be able to become the new leader of the train replacing the mythical Wilford but he needs the assistance of Minsoo (Kang-Ho Song)who designed the locks on the doors to each of the cars.

END OF SPOILERS:

Although a bit flawed (there are a number of questions about the existence of the train riders that aren't answered and the CGI although it varies from good to servicable occasionally looks like it was pulled from a videogame), the performances, production design, clever storyline and direction more than make up for the flaws.

Currently the film is available on-demand. Evans,Hurt and Tilda Swindon as a member of the government all give terrific performances (and Swindon is hilarious). Although the CGI could be better and there are some  unanswered questions about this society that could and should have been addressed in the film, ""Snowpiercer"" is a trip you won't forget.

6353956,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"SNOWPIERCER has been one of my most anticipated movies since I first heard about it last year. I eagerly followed all the news I could get my hands on, and was one of many who bristled at the thought of Harvey Weinstein going snip-happy over it for a theatrical release. Thank goodness that never came to pass. So, now that I've seen it, was it worth the wait? Did it live up to my expectations? I would say the answer to that question is an unequivocal yes. This movie was definitely worth the wait, although there are a few aspects of it that slightly dampened the experience.

 The story is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth where a chemical released into the atmosphere, ostensibly/hopefully to alleviate global warming, causes Earth to turn into a frozen wasteland. Humanity's few survivors are packed into a perpetually moving train designed and conducted by Wilford, a mysterious person who has a godlike status among the passengers. During their time on the train, society has solidified into a rigid class system (not unlike real life sometimes) that is separated by the different cars on the train. Chris Evans plays Curtis, a young man who plans to lead a revolt and take control of the engine. With that, I'll stop describing the plot because it is best to go into this film with as little information as possible, so as not to spoil anything.

 Thematically, the film deals with class struggle and the ways that people are controlled to keep social order. The film doesn't really beat you over the head with its ideas, but there are a few sequences which present them in an effective way. Performance-wise, there is little to complain about. Chris Evans does a marvelous job, and this might be the best performance of his career (so far). He plays the part of a reluctant leader with appropriate amounts of brooding, and outrage at what he finds out on his way to the front of the train. John Hurt plays Gilliam (a nod to Terry Gilliam, no doubt), an old man in the tail car who is sort of a mentor to Curtis. There were also decent showings by Jamie Bell and Octavia Spencer as two of Curtis' fellow revolutionaries. However, the most entertaining performance was given by Tilda Swinton as Minister Mason. She is nearly unrecognizable, and gives a delightfully cheeky performance as what is essentially a stooge for the establishment. She was given several great character moments, and she nailed them all.

 Visually, I thought that Bong Joon-Ho (and his cinematographer) effectively and realistically created a world in which to immerse the audience. Not everything is explained or spoon-fed, which was also a plus. The CGI wasn't as good as in mainstream Hollywood films, but it wasn't terrible either. About the best you can expect from a lower-budget Korean-Czech coproduction, and pretty high by Korean standards. Mostly, the visual effects showing the frozen outside world looked good, and the effects used inside the train worked as well.

 Overall, I thought the movie was excellent. The only real gripe I have is with some occasional pacing issues, although once the plot is set in motion it never lets up. I highly recommend you see this movie, not only to support smaller films but because its more intellectually engaging than half of the crap that passes for entertainment these days.",1405123200,107,3310,4.825396825396825

I was expecting more of a straight-forward fun action film, which is not to say this wasn't fun and full of action - it was.  It was much more.  Great performances.  Chris Evans really proved he can carry a film that doesn't have Marvel in the title.  Tilda Swinton rarely plays a character that I ""like"" but she is always so so interesting - definitely no exception here.  The visuals were surreal, surprising, and sometimes completely haunting.

To me, the overall concept of lower class and higher class citizens being separated and treated differently was very similar to the concept of Elysium. However, like I said, it was told in a refreshing way, and there are a few interesting twists!

The acting was good. I thought Chris Evans did an excellent job playing his character. Some of the ""rich"" or ""upper class"" characters reminded me of characters from the Hunger Games movies.

The CGI isn't spectacular, but it's not bad either. I don't you will find any scenes that stick out as particularly cheesy.

6353969,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"""Snowpiercer"" offers a lot to like. The man-made ecological collapse (caused by trying to fix another man-made eco-disaster) sounds a warning that we need to hear again and again. As a plot element, brutal class warfare is hard to beat - especially when the real-life rich/poor divide seems to be growing so fast. The smug overlord re-inventing slavery and bemoaning his pampered life is the kind of guy you just can't wait to see overthrown. Add in some great performances, including the most un-Swinton-like role I've ever seen Swinton in, and you have all the makings of a movie that will be considered a classic.

All the makings but one: a credible premise. Yes, trains are cool and everything. Also, the inherently linear structure conveniently enforces the hierarchy of caste so important to the plot. But really, a train? With all the vulnerabilities that track, trestles, and tunnels are subject to? Year after year after year? Compared to a great big bunker somewhere, maybe with geothermal heating, this makes sense how? I mean, I'll happily accept a few oddities to get things going and do my part to suspend disbelief. The script should do a bit more to help me suspend it, though.

Except for that one huge, glaring, ridiculous, inescapable feature, I actually liked this. That one thing, though, it was just a but much for me.

_____________________________________________________________

Both directed and written by Joon-ho Bong comes an action thriller that sees an apocalyptic earth with only a speeding train left running. As the train is divided into social rankings- the rich and the poor- a rebellion is brooding amongst those in the back of the train. When head leader Curtis (Chris Evans) leads a group towards the front of the train, startling revelations come forth as they inch closer to meeting Mr. Wilford (Ed Harris); a man who invented the train to ensure the survival of those fortunate and to retain a semblance of life. No one can predict how terrifying a world can be within the confines of a fast moving body.

When you hear about a movie that takes place onboard a train with no sign of life outside, isolations sits in. While watching Snowpiercer there was never a moment that became dull but more so intrigued as the film rolled along. It says a lot about society and how we treat different classes under harsh circumstances. Along-side Chris Evans, in supporting roles, are  Jamie Bell as Edgar and Octavia Spencer as Tanya who stand side by side with Curtis during the rebellion. It was great to see Spencer in action and who would have known she could cause damage.

The pacing of the movie was excellent and the 125 minute (2 hours, 5 minutes) runtime is never felt. Brilliant story telling and design that made the film enjoyable all that more. There were moments that would keep you on edge; especially a scene involving a car full of sword wielding men and a tunnel. Many times did I think about what we take for granted and what it's like to be alone versus constantly being surrounded by people. The idea of sustaining balance in a world that can be overcrowded and doing what is necessary in retaining it.

If there was anything to gripe about it would be the last scene of the film; not to give anything away. Not too many flaws are seen in the movie and that is an accomplishment on of its own. A great performance by Chris Evans as he stood tall and strong while taking an emotional beat down at films end. Who would have thought a train as a symbol of hope become a life of agony and misery. Evans is an amazing actor who pulled no punches when it came to wanting answers and truth.

A roller-coaster ride indeed and one that is fun and disturbing to watch. An action packed thrill-ride that will keep you guessing with awesome performances led by top caliber actors. As the movie will not see a wide release, if you are able to find it playing at any of your local theaters I highly recommend this movie. Don't wait and check out Snowpiercer today!!",1404691200,5,2725,4.619834710743802
6353971,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

So here it is July 4th weekend.  What are the sci-fi choices in theaters now?  Well, I could go see the umpteenth version of ""Transformers"" which is playing in about 30 theater screens within a 5 mile radius of my house.  Or, I could drive 10 miles and check out this unusual looking film from South Korean director Joon-ho Bong.  It does have Chris Evans, fresh from ""Captain America"" and Tilda Swenton, last seen as an 80 year old woman in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel.""  I decided to take the drive.

First of all, you have to buy into the premise.  It's the near future and global warming is for real, so the scientists come up with a solution which, in fact, fixes the problem.  They also kill everything on the planet with a catastrophic cold wave.  The cockroaches survive as usual as you will find out later in the film.  There are survivors who manage to board a train that circles the globe non-stop...forever.  The train is the foresight of a man known as Wilford.  I usual give actor credits here, but it is suggested I not, as it is a big surprise.  It wasn't to me, but if you want to look it up go to IMDb or something.

Like much of the world, the train is split up into the ""have-nots"" led by Curtis (Evans) and his mentor, Gilliam (John Hurt).  They live in the back of the train, far removed from the ""haves"" way up front.  The 1 percenters are led by Wilford and his second in command, Mason (Swinton).  And before I go much farther, she's a hoot. Especially when the contingent reach the kiddie's classroom.  In addition, there are a collection of thugs whose mission is to keep the riff raff in the back where they belong.  They live in squalor and get a protein bar for their daily ration.  I won't go into the content but it will put your gag reflex in overdrive.  As fair warning there are a couple more events that will unsettle most.  But the film does do a good job of setting the stage for the conditions these people have been in for 17 years and why they want to escape.

Armed with little more than their determination, the rebellion is afoot.  One by one the rebels move up car-by-car until they reach the domain of the guy in charge of the locks between the cars.  Namgoon Minsoo (Kang-ho Song) is the guy and is aroused from his cryogenic sleep along with his daughter, Yona (Ah-sung Ko).  He agrees to help (always in Korean) but only if he's supplied with a regular supply of homemade drug that he's addicted to.  Essentially the film is as simple as that.  Get to the engine where Wilford lives.

The combat portions of the film are excellent.  The film is purposely dark and gloomy.  It isn't a feel good movie.  People you become fond of are killed.  Kids are in the mix and are exploited, but damn if this isn't a refreshing change from the stuff we are often exposed to in mainstream movies.  The film ends on a bleak, if hopeful note.  But this isn't mainstream.  Which is probably why the woman walking out of the theater behind me said to her husband.  ""That's the worst movie I've ever seen""!  She obviously hasn't see the latest ""Transformers.""",1404604800,218,3132,4.4073426573426575
6353972,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"Nine Things about the Movie Snowpiercer  [USA, South Korea, 2013]

1. This crazy cool science fiction film is one of the most astounding, violent - and weird - movies of the year.

2. The opening credits frontload the story: In 2014, in order to combat global warming, a chemical was released into the atmosphere to cool the temperature a few degrees. Only it went too far and the planet froze. The only survivors are a few thousand people on a train that continuously circles the globe. The train is divided according to class structure, with the richest people living in the head of the train, and the poorest living in the tail.

3. The movie opens by dropping you onto the train in the year 2031, and lets you figure out the rest of whats going on by yourself. It gives you the broad strokes, but you have to do some work to figure out some of the details.

4. The main focus of the movie is a revolution by the poor people to advance and take over the head of the train. But as the class warfare escalates, you learn more of the secrets about the train. The story slowly spins outward to encompass a lot of issues and ideas.

5. The movie balances humor, anxiety, fear, chaos, and horror, and places it all on a moving train that nobody can leave. It is a lot darker and more violent than I expected.

6. The mood is lightened a few times by some really weird humor that feels out of place with the rest of the movie, but its well done, so you just go with it.

7.  The acting is uniformly great. This is easily the best performance Ive seen by Chris Evans. I didn't know he could actually act, but I totally forgive him for being Captain America now. And while Tilda Swinton has never given a bad performance, she is deliciously deranged in this movie. This will go down as one of her more memorable roles.

8. Being directed by a South Korean director, the movie was released last year in South Korea, where it broke box-office records. But the American studio releasing the film wanted some changes to make it less weird, not as dark, and easier to understand. The director refused, and there was a battle over the control of the film. The director won, and the movie was released in its original form, although just in a small amount of theaters.

9. Not everyone is going to like this movie. Its pretty strange. Its political, psychological, and philosophical. Theres a high body count. Its both thought-provoking and gut-wrenching. But if you want a science fiction film that is the exact opposite of blockbusters like Transformers, then this is what you want to see.",1404604800,13,2578,4.463829787234043
6353973,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Just watched the full 2 hour, 6 minute version of Snowpiercer at a local theater in downtown Oklahoma City.  First-rate acting from an incredibly varied cast (and one of Chris Evans' better roles), superb art and sound design (even if the CGI was a touch weak in spots) and a decent story.  All for under $40M.  Which begged the question:  Why can't Hollywood muster the talent to do this?

So who's Harvey?  That would be Harvey Weinstein of the Weinstein Company, who demanded that the director, Bong Joon-ho, cut 25 minutes from the movie's run-time, stating that their  aim is to 'make sure the film will be understood by audiences in Iowa and Oklahoma'. Gee Harv, thanks for the vote of confidence, you twit...

But more importantly, thanks to Mr. Bong for sticking to his guns.  I've been waiting for this movie for almost six months and figured that my first viewing would be on Blu-Ray.  That's why I was amazed to wake up this morning and find it showing at a local theater.

Favorite scene:  When an operative clairvoyant tells you 'Don't open the gate', you should probably listen...(see the movie to get the point; serious creepy factor...it looked like something out of a Giger sketchbook).

Weaknesses:  The third act seemed a bit overlong and could have benefited from a tighter edit.  Also, polar bears are one of the few predators that will track and eat humans (Minor spoiler here for what was not a real 'up' closing note...).

Overall, Snowpiercer has some cerebral elements, but is a solid actioner with a solid cast.  Well done, Mr. Bong.  Recommended.",1404604800,11,1574,4.766666666666667
6353974,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Just when you thought trains were boring and ancient, Snowpiercer will help you curb that. The new film from Bong Joon Ho was released back in 2013 in his native South Korea and elsewhere to impressive numbers, with around $80 million worldwide. Despite the director's origins in Korean-language films, the film mostly in English and it features a Hollywood-friendly cast consisting of Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, and John Hurt.

 The film tells the tale of a future destroyed by severe climate change where everything is snowy and icy. The whole film is set on a train built by a sinister entity known as Wilford Industries and depicts the poorer, ailing members on the locomotive from the tail-end ready to ignite a violent revolution all the way to the front of the train after being abused and tired of the classism existent on board.

 Not surprising given his role in ""Captain America,"" Chris Evans, with a grizzly beard, plays the performance of the lead man working with an elder to kick-start the revolt and Tilda Swinton plays a Northern English-accented woman who manipulates the poor people to comply with the demands of the train and obey law and order.

 Several themes and issues are at play here but the way in which the film develops it is one of the Hollywood film, however, with significant and bizarre diversions. It relies on dialogue and spectacular action scenes that one might find in a big-budget PG-13 action movie but then as the film progresses, the film delves more bizarrely into surreal non-sequitir humour, impromptu at-your-face sadistic relish, odd set pieces in the train cars, and a Korean man who is the key for the poor passengers' revolt all drugged out and aggressive.

 In one scene, Swinton's character intrudes into a train car that has a mobile aquarium inside and then allows the poor passengers who have interrogated her to eat sushi. Then in another, a train car full of school students are instructed by a teacher who is too cheerful and happy for her own good saying if you go outside the train ""you'll freeze and die."" These bizarre moments are not negative points about the film but largely positive as it adds to the whole whimsy that ""Snowpiercer"" is.

 It cannot be explained that easily but considering the film is based off a French graphic novel of almost unknown origins, those could be possible reasons why maybe this was not made anytime before 2013. For film fans, this is strongly reminiscent of a Jean Pierre-Jeunet film, the man who done ""Amelie"" and ""Delicatessen,"" but with more scientific devices and a darker tone. It also harkens back to last year's ""Elysium"" which dealt with class warfare but with more clarity and sci-fi spectacle and ""WALL-E"" especially with the environmental messages, corporatism satire, and how humans especially rich ones are sedated with excess convenience.

 It maybe marketed as science-fiction but it feels more closer to dystopian action spectacle than anything given how some say that climate change is not too far-fetched and is proven and how class warfare still destroys the fabric of certain societies and cities to this very day. If you think about it, it could almost play as a reminder of the French revolution or 1910s Marxist-Leninist rebellion. However, such comparisons are very controversial and could imply that the film has an explicit left-wing bias.

 The film's supposed bias is not explicit, politicised, or hopeful as ""Elysium"" but what the audience will get from the film, especially the ending, is an uncertain reminder of how human actions can affect us all or will help set the future. The film does progress and end with an anti-climax quite cynically implicating how humanity will be and I think this is to his credit. However, this uncertainty might not have made it as Hollywood-friendly as they might have wished and the film's grisly violence, non-sequitir nature, and irregular narrative devices might lead some audiences to be baffled by what they say resulting in confounded expectations. For me, on the other hand, the film was not problematic really aside from the ending where the emotions and action starts descending into somewhat unfulfilled suspense.

 Overall, Snowpiercer is a satisfying, well-rounded, and surprisingly funny experience that fans of dystopian works and even high-school literature will appreciate. Its action scenes rival that of Hollywood, the set pieces are mesmerising, and the radio clips in the beginning are compelling. How the film managed to get funded and produced by the South Koreans and even the Czech still amazes me to this day and how Hollywood producing and managing films are not always the answer, especially in the new age of a globalised film industry.",1404518400,3,4742,5.006353240152478
6353975,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Snowpiercer exists in a world of pure fantasy despite being set in the very near future with the Earth enduring an Ice Age because of man's overreaction to global warming. On board the train which holds humanity's last survivors, the wretched poor in the tail section have had enough of their plight lasting for 17 years and lead yet another revolt against the elite in the front.

Chris Evans, doing his best Ben Affleck impression, leads the cast in this gripping, intelligent thriller that presents a magnificent setting inside the claustrophobic chambers of the train. It really is an excellent means of disguising the mere $40 million budget, yet its presentation is along the lines of summer blockbuster status. The comparisons to Metropolis are well founded and it does offer more heart and humanity than most slam-bang action thrillers, although ""Logan's Run"" also comes to mind about a society cut off from the outside world. Tilda Swinton's character in particular is so out of place that she is frankly perfect. A couple of settings, particularly a children's classroom and a massive aquarium simply sparkle with imagination which is rare for a ""big time"" thriller.

Of particular note is the confrontation scene shown in the trailer between the ""wretched poor"" and the enforcers, many of whom wear their ski masks pulled down so their eyes are hidden, much like the Persian ""Immortals"" when they faced the Spartans at Thermopolye. How the battle is executed is arguably the highlight of an already impressive film.

However, the pacing is not all that great, especially towards the end where we get a couple of elongated scenes that could have been shortened to greater effect. One minor quibble is that the actor playing the ""bad guy"" is revealed in the trailer and promotional materials which is a shame as I managed to keep in the dark about his identity which turned out to be a nice surprise. The final scene, which I will not reveal, offers both hope and foreboding all in the same shot which is quite well done.

Overall, ""Snowpiercer"" is an exceptional sci-fi thriller that is one of the best of the year. However, a little tightening here and there with a better executed final 20 minutes and it would have been a modern classic.",1404345600,3,2250,4.866840731070496
6353976,4,B00JBBJJ4C,"Will he or won't he? There's been a great deal of talk amongst cinephiles about South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer, but the ""he"" in question is actually Harvey Weinstein. And the question was whether we would get to see the film in full as Bong would have preferred, or if Harvey would do one of his infamous hatchet jobs, threatening to slice 20 minutes from it for American audiences who prefer their action movies brisk and short. In the end we're getting the version Bong always intended and the dystopian world he envisions is incredibly immersive and extremely thrilling....but maybe some of those edits should have been kept in.

So much about Snowpiercer goes a long way in placing it amongst the very best and smartest sci-fi movies around that any flaws prove to be glaring. What's not an issue is how Bong is able to fully realize a future world and all of its problems with a bare minimum of exposition, at least initially. Finally convinced of the threat of global warming, the world governments band together to release a substance called CW7 into the air. It works, but rather than dropping the temperature down a few degrees the world is thrust into a new Ice Age, killing all life on the planet but a handful of survivors. Somehow they all managed to board a luxury perpetual motion train known as the Snowpiercer, and now it races all around the world. If it stops everyone on board could die and humanity would be extinguished.

But that may happen anyway because the system aboard the train is divided up by social status. The dregs, society's poor, are banished to the train's tail while the elite live near the front in the lap of luxury. The downtrodden live in squalor, feasting on disgusting ""protein"" as their main sustenance, and suffering the wrath of train security if anyone steps out of line. There have been rebellions, all soundly defeated, but a new one is building led by the brooding hero, Curtis (Chris Evans), and his wizened old mentor, Gilliam (John Hurt). Tired of being bullied by the chittering, teeth-gnashing bureaucrat Mason (Tilda Swinton, in dork mode), Curtis, his right-hand man Edgar (Jamie Bell), and a drug-addled engineer (Song Kang-ho) gather an army and proceed to take the train car by car.

Combining brutal action with art house sensibilities, think The Raid meets Metropolis, as the tail section survivors endure one bloody battle after another against the elite's heavily armed goon squad. Bong and screenwriter Kelly Masterson aren't content to make this just another beat 'em up, though, adding in stark social commentary and a central mystery of the train's origins for audiences to ponder. Designed often like the levels in an arcade game, each train car has a different feel and significance, like the oddball classroom led by pregnant, gun-toting schoolteacher (Alison Pill); or one glorious car built as a giant aquarium. The amount Bong is able to accomplish on a modest $40M budget is remarkable and shows his range in capturing the vibrant and unbearably grim. Not that we should be surprised at Bong's range. This is the same guy who delivered one of the great modern monster movies in The Host, and the haunting South Korean film noir, Mother, both exceptional entries to their respective genres. The CGI gets a little dicey when the action moves, however briefly, outside the train to the frozen Earth below.

In working with a largely American audience Bong has managed to cull some memorable performances from his cast. Whatever the heck Swinton is doing with her nerdy librarian routine as Mason, she needs to keep doing it because she is simply amazing and a lot of fun. Supporting players Octavia Spencer, Ed Harris, Bell, Kang-ho, and Ko Ah-sung bring a ton of depth to characters that don't all get a lot of screen time. Evans shows off the physicality and stoic personality we've seen him employ as Captain America, but his character is probably the least defined of the bunch. That was probably done to maintain some level of secrecy but it becomes an issue later on we need to believe the choices he makes.

After a certain point the film begins to lose some of the momentum it left the station with as questions get answered and characters' true natures are revealed. This is probably the area where Weinstein was hoping to do some chopping as the final act is bogged down by a lot of people standing around explaining what was left out before. The energy comes to a dead halt as new surprises emerge seemingly out of nowhere with one major character twist lacking potency because of it.

It's become a common complaint that Hollywood doesn't offer enough in the way of heady sci-fi movies but the truth is that dynamic is changing. In a way it's ironic that Snowpiercer isn't getting a wider release because it pulls no punches either in brains or brawn and should appeal to audiences of every stripe.",1404345600,2,4901,4.807829181494662
6353977,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"If there is one film in 2014 that everyone needs to view it is Korean director Bong Joon-ho's nearly perfect science-fiction action thriller Snowpiercer. I have wanted to see Snowpiercer since I saw the films first trailer over nine months ago. The footage from the trailer looked like the film beautifully mixed elements of a post-apocalyptic dystopian world with action and drama along with a great international cast in John Hurt, Ed Harris, Song Kang-ho, Jamie Bell, Tilda Swinton, and Chris Evens. Snowpiercer was originally supposed to have been released in the United States in late 2013 or very early 2014, but after The Weinstein Company had bought the distribution rights for North America and other countries like England and Australia Harvey Weinstein demanded that twenty minutes be cut from the two hour and five minute film. Things like this happen often when studios and distribution companies get into creative arguments with directors and writers.

I can understand why Weinstein would want cuts made to Snowpiercer. While the Snowpiercer has a great international cast I'd say outside of Chris Evens and maybe Ed Harris most of America probably wouldn't recognize the faces or names of the cast. Next Weinstein wanted the film cut so it could have more showings in a day earning more money for the studio even if it hurts the story and final product of the film. Finally I don't think Weinstein has faith in the general American viewing audience as the story elements would go over much of the audience's heads. After Bong Joon-ho refused to cut the film this lead to a long staring match between the director and Weinstein, and I believe it was a real possibility that Snowpiercer would never be released in the United States. Thankfully things change after the Snowpiercer was released in South Korea becoming I believe the highest grossing film ever in the country, and continued to do well in France, Thailand and other countries, and Harvey Weinstein blinked first agreeing to release the complete cut of Snowpiercer, which will be a limited release on June 27th as well as being released on VOD. The question now after the release delay and arguments about the film is whether Bong Joon-ho's complete film is worth it, and the answer is unequivocal yes as Snowpiercer is a nearly perfect film and the best dystopian science fiction since Children of Men, or 12 Monkeys.

The massive train with over twenty cars barrels over the ice covered planet that was once Earth carrying over one thousand passengers who are the last survivors of the human race. Over seventeen year's earlier pollution and the greenhouse gas effect has caused earth temperatures to rise with no sign of stopping. The world leaders begin to look into ways of stopping the rising of Earth's temperature without stopping or curtailing their industrial and polluting ways. That leads to the controversial CW7 that fifty seven industrialized nations say will lower the Earth's temperature. Scientists along with environmentalists and developing nations protest the use of CW7, but the leading nations ignore them, and on July 1st 2014 fifty seven nations begin to release CW7 into the upper atmosphere. In attempting to play god and control nature the human race doomed themselves, because CW7 was too effective dropping the Earth's temperature drastically within days and weeks Earth begin to freeze over leading to all life on the planet becoming extinct, and the human race not far behind. Perhaps the last human's board Wilford's futuristic luxury train in the hope of survival.

Mr. Wilford and his company wanted to build the most advanced and luxurious train in the world as well as building a railway that circ*mnavigated the world. The world laughed at him as Mr. Wilford build his train and railway that would go around the world in a year, but even as countries were planning and debating CW7 Mr. Wilford knew that it wouldn't work and prepared, and was one of the only ones or perhaps the only person truly prepared for what was to come. Now seventeen years later after the planet has frozen over the last of humanity is surviving on Mr. Wilsons train in a class system with the passengers who had bought first class tickets in the front of the train, the economy ticket holders in the middle, and the freeloaders who were just trying to survive in the back. That is where we find Curtis Everett and the rest of the beaten down lower class who have no free will. They're fed some kind of slug that looks like a gelatin brick. Their children are taken for some unknown reason as are people who can cook or play the violin, and these people are never seen again. Curtis Everett his mentor Gilliam, and the rest of the beaten down have had enough planning to take the train with the help of a security expert Namgoong Minsu who had help build and design the doors of the train who was currently locked up in the prison car. The Curtis Revolution brings a lot of sacrifices, bloodshed, and startling truths about the passengers, and the train itself.

Bong Joon-ho wrote his dark and emotionally raw script based on a French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand, and Jean-Marc Rochette. I have never read or heard about Le Transperceneige before seeing the first Snowpiercer trailer, but apparently Bong Joon-ho came across the series in a comic shop, and the director was so captivated by the comic he read the entire series while he was at the comic book store. From what I've read Bong Joon-ho did his best to stay true to the comic and the ideas given in the story that observes the human race studying how we function, and the complexities of the human race that includes social class order, capitalist folly, humanities hubris in believing it can control nature, the price of survival in an environment of limited resources, and a look into the idea of revolution like is an uprising worth the risk if it meant the price of the majority of the revolution's followers deaths, and they might not like the answers they find at the end of their journey. In all honesty it is kind of a ridiculous premise in that an eccentric billionaire would build a luxury train line that went around the world or that so how humanity would go to a train for survival, but it is thanks the emotionally charge script, amazing acting, and great action that turned a ridiculous premise into a truly remarkable film.

Speaking of the film or the filming of Snowpiercer it was remarkable at what director Bong Jong-ho and the production crew was able to do with a forty million dollar budget. The film takes place entirely in doors in confined spaces with limited room for cameramen, actors, director and additional staff yet the production, and set designers were able to bring to life each train car with its own personality from the back of the train that looks like the slums of a major city, the prison car, a train car that was just an giant aquarium, school, night club, and more. The designers and production staff did a remarkable job with the limited space they had making each train car believable even in such a confined space. With a film that takes a place entirely in a train there wasn't much need of CGI or special effects, but when were used they were nearly flawless giving us a peak of the frozen planet as the train passed once mighty cities, downed planes, and over turned giant ships.

The action in snowpiercer was intense, gritty and violent as the production crew, extras, and actors did a superb job bringing the action to life. There are two scenes that standout the first is a huge battle between Wilford's soldiers and Curtis's army. Thinking no one is on the other side of the train cars doors Curtis and the rest aren't paying attention, but as the doors open they see an army of masked men with axes and knives making them look like a cross between soldiers and butchers. The scene is wonderfully directed and filmed as it is shown both in normal time and slow motion. The battle is intense were much blood is shed, and many lives are lost that leads to an outstanding nighttime battle as the train goes through a tunnel, and Wilford's men dawn night vision equipment. The second scene takes place on the school train car where we get a little history lesson about Wilford, and past revolutions by the teacher that leads to a gripping gun battle, massacre, and execution.

Besides the rich, dark, and emotionally captivating story the star of the film is the acting by this great international cast. Though I have never heard of Song Kang-ho before the South Korean actor does a splendid job playing Namgoong Minsu the prisoner security expert, and father to Yona (Go Ah-sung) who suspects something about the frozen Earth, the train, and along his journey to the front comes to a realization that could change everything. Tilda Swinton who I loved from the Beach and Constantine gives a devilish performance as the sadistic prime minster Mason. Ed Harris gives his best performance in many years playing the eccentric Mr. Wilford giving a speech in the climax that will make sense, but will also disturb and anger many. I can't forget to give recognition to Vlad Ivanov who plays a character with no dialogue. From the credits he played Franco the Elder who dogs Curtis and his companions throughout the train. Even without any dialogue Ivanov gives a menacing performance with just his facial expressions and the look in his eyes.

The award for the best performance in Snowpiercer goes to Mr. Captain America Chris Evans. If it is true that Evans is really going to retire from acting than he is going out giving what is his best performance of his short career. Chris plays Curtis Everett the emotionally scarred revolutionary leader who wants to forget what happened when he first boarded the train seventeen years ago, along with freeing his people from the plight in the world, and more importantly over throwing Mr. Wilford who he hates with a passion. Evens displays the true capabilities of his acting throughout the film, and in the final act gives such and emotionally charged performance as he recounts his early days on the train that I was left stunned. I was always known Chris Evens was a capable actor with strong performances in Sunshine and Cellular, but in Snowpiercer Evens gives the performance of his career.

Though Snowpiercer does have a ridiculous and actually somewhat original premise that on the surface probably shouldn't have worked on film it is thanks Bong Joon-ho writing and directing along with an outstanding production crew, and exceptional performances of his actors in particular his star Chis Evens that Snowpiercer is a dystopian sci-fi action film for the ages along with the likes of 12 Monkeys, 1984, and Children of Men making Snowpiercer a must see film for everyone.",1402444800,71,10860,4.809421841541756
6353978,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"FILM:  (Skip directly to Blu-Ray comparison and Update sections if not interested in a random film review that shouldn't mean anything to you anyway.)

What can I say? This is a science fiction/action film and, somehow, with the incredible direction, production, cinematography, set design, score and, of course, acting, it is really a drama. If someone asked me, I'd wouldn't know what to say. It is as though they took high art independent film drama, impressive all by itself, and transformed it into a sci-fi/action/thrill-ride without diminishing the drama or adding needless comedic silliness. I don't know what to call this but, without doubt, it is the best film I've seen in theater in over a decade. I've seen approximately 100 films that way in that time. It is in the top twenty I've seen in the last decade overall, including all dvd and blu-ray options and television commercial free airings. I've seen approximately 500. The writing is excellent, not surprising as it is Bong Joon-ho's adaptation of a decade's old graphic novel that people still talk about. The direction is excellent, again, thanks to writer/director Bong. The acting is, you guessed it, excellent and you can skip down to the Blu-ray section if that is unimportant to you.

Starting with John Hurt, I can only say he is perfect, as he always is. (Anyone who can make Doctor Zero--the one we've never heard of before--pop off the screen, dwarfing both the 10th and 11th doctor to such an extant one might actually forget they were even there, is an actor who doesn't need my praise. He is an acting god.)

Tilda Swinton is magic, pure and easy. She makes it seem as though her job is fun and simple when it is a tremendous effort born of intense planning and practice and in this role she shines, as in all others.

Chris Evans, an actor too often misunderstood in his style, is true to form in his decision to always analyze the emotion before attempting to play it, rather than just tossing whatever imitation came to mind while sitting in a back-lot caravan on break or sleeping, up at the camera, out to the audience, as though we can't tell if the feeling is appropriate for the character in that moment. My favorite example of mindful acting, for him, is The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond, in which he showcased a brilliant ability to play repression without mistakenly conveying depression, an error nearly every actor out there has made at one time or another, generally when they are very young. In Snowpiercer, with similar mindfulness, he seeks to convey a man beaten down to nothing, having pulled himself back up, under the guidance of a revolutionary and father figure, into a creature of will. He has one goal, to lead the revolt, leave the past behind him and fight his way to the front of the Snowpiercer, the massive train you've read about in the other reviews. As he moves through the train, so does he move through his past life, slashing and crushing and tearing at the constructed reality he left behind 18 years ago, when the world ended and his nightmare version of life, a terror that would become the truest reality he could ever have experienced, swelled up around him and swallowed him. We see none of this, of course, or it wouldn't be a great performance. He doesn't flash back or have long conversations about afternoons wandering the hillsides, but he shows us in the absence of joy and the glances away from reminders of what once was, in moments of planning and flailing and moments of internal reflection, without having to rely on these tools of inadequate performance. To see him alongside actors who can be legitimately labeled as perfect, never failing, never faltering, having worked at it for so many years that any writer or director would believe they had won the lottery to have them, Hurt and Swinton and, in the very end, Ed Harris (who I adore), showcasing talent on their screen, Chris Evans, the only Avenger to ever look around him in moments of false and manufactured humor with an expression of ""why am I here"", while the clowns danced around him, was magnificent and, for that very reason, for being one of the Marvel actors who don't have the opportunity to give you something real, he deserves praise. I am impressed and that doesn't come easy for me. I used to say he's a good actor, citing indie films and random moments in Captain America that almost made it something people might remember in a hundred years, but no more. He is an actor, a true actor, a great actor and, even surrounded by this unbelievable cast of performers, he shines, holds his own, dominates the film and never fails to give the best, highest, most appropriate line reading, literally pitch perfect, even with all that running.

So, if you enjoy science fiction and drama, if you enjoy films that take themselves seriously and don't overcompensate for a weak plot with out of place comedy, if you enjoy films in which characters understand the gravity of their situation and have actual feelings, if you enjoy films with action and excitement interwoven with political and social and religious and philosophical explorations presented through story and idea rather than endless prattle or speeches meant to explain or talk down to an audience the producers believe is made up of morons, if you enjoy storytelling without all the clich and giant robots... well... congratulations on not being a tool. Also, go see this movie or purchase it and enjoy just as soon as you can. I hate seeing films in theater for too many reasons to list but I saw this one and I will see it again, so take that for whatever it is worth. On to the Blu-ray releases.

Blu-Ray:  (Read here for Blu-ray comparison, absent my pontification, for the most part.)

There are now several Region A options available including a Hong Kong release, Japan release and the Korean Kimchee releases. All but one are priced, it would seem, by mental patients and are only worth it if you are filthy stinking rich (which I am not so, moving on). There are also several Region B options, unfortunately, without subtitle options in English, as no UK release has arrived or even been announced. And so, back to the Region A options. Of the Region A options, Hong Kong by Panorama is the only one priced to purchase (yup, it is actually the cheapest at $36). However, as the only release with English subtitles for under $40, it is important to note that the subtitles can either be off or on... that is to say on screen, for the whole of the film or off screen. In theory, you could pause the film and change the settings repeatedly while watching but we both know you are not going to do that. (I'm certainly not.) These English subtitles that are, for whatever reason, so hard to find, are not ""forced"" subtitles that can never be turned off, but they are continuous in that they cannot be removed once turned on without pausing the film to remove them. To clarify, you can watch and not understand what I consider to be a large enough portion of the film that I was unhappy with this or you can watch and understand via subtitles that cannot be removed for the English portion of the film (which you already understand if you are a region A viewer who cared enough to purchase this film on Blu-ray with no other subtitle options except for, I believe, Chinese). If subtitles are unimportant to you, then you have the option of including Region B, English subtitle-free releases for your consideration. As for the Region B releases, there are two main prints circulating: the French Warner Brothers release print which preserves the original aspect ratio of 1:85:1 and the Italian by Koch media that has been sized to fit a 1:78:1 screen. (There is also a German print that has not been compared favorably to the picture quality of the French version though it also maintains the original aspect ratio.) ""of these options, there are pros and cons. The Koch Italian Blu-ray has superior quality in picture and vastly superior audio, however, it is the one that cuts the sides off of every shot to make it fit your screen perfectly. Additionally, some have complained that the blacks are not black enough (though that can easily be corrected with a tweak on your television settings). The French version has very high picture and audio quality but is not the ""best available"", which is why I felt I needed both. (That and the special features.) And what about features? The Koch edition has a bunch, some in English and some in Italian. The French edition has a bunch, mostly in French, including a documentary that runs 54 minutes and is mostly in French with no English subtitles. Still, they are high quality releases and getting a good deal on either would be worth it if you have a region free player. That having been said, if you are in America or Canada and are not wealthy enough to purchase a region free Blu-ray player or at least a poor person (like me) who was lucky enough to have manipulated someone into getting you the best Christmas present ever last year, then your only choice is to purchase Region A or make your peace with having to wait until the theatrical release has come and gone and the fools in charge of distribution finally decide to release an uncut Region A Blu-ray of this film for Region A in North America because, apparently, they don't like money as much as they should and have no plans at this time. On another note, digital download is available which can be corrupted and is always of lower quality. However, if you are just looking to see the thing, iTunes has it and some VOD services. But if you want a pristine copy for home viewing, these are your current best options and I highly recommend the Hong Kong release for those who are limited to Region A viewing only, the French release for composition hounds (those who can't abide the loss of the slivers down the left and right side of the picture) and the Italian release by Koch for video and audiophiles as it has a higher quality picture (by enough to make a difference but not enough to blow your mind) and much higher quality audio (by fully doubling the quality over any other release). Good luck with this. It is not an easy choice.

UPDATE:

A Region A, North American release has been scheduled, tentatively for October 1, 2014, by Anchor Bay/Starz. No press release has been issued concerning special features though it is a safe bet that this version will, like the theatrical release, contain English subtitles only for Korean dialogue, which, at the very least, makes this worth the buy if you like this film. There is no information regarding video or audio speed or the quality of the transfers, status on 5.1 vs. 6.1 vs. 7.1 master audio or if the files will be LPCM. Additionally, it is unknown as to whether there will be a special or deluxe edition down the line. If I had to guess, this is one of those films that will only receive a double disc edition if the first edition sells very well and demand is high. As for the size, 25 or 50GB, initial information was that it would be a 50GB Blu-ray but no confirmation has been given. I will post additional information as it becomes available. As of now, early August, the Hong Kong release is still the best bet. As for cropping, I saw this cropped in theater (a 1:78:1 presentation) and have a lovely 1:85:1 print from Hong Kong. I can't imagine that they would crop this, however, it is always possible. My recommendation is to pre-order this to lock in the price and watch for more information as it becomes available. You can always cancel if they crop the image or pull some stunt like 685 kbps audio instead of the standard of at least 3000 kbps (and really good Blu-rays are doing 6000 now) or, like me, collect multiple editions for different audio, picture and features.

Random Note:

Not to be rude, but the only people who see films in the theater any more are the sort who think The Avengers is the height of cinema (an action comedy that plays as though it were acted out by cardboard cutouts, with their endless supplies of inner camp just oozing off of the screen as they just couldn't be bothered to care), basically children and people forced to accompany them to those dark no-pause-for-pee-breaks hell-holes. For those of us waiting and wanting to fork over the funds for a Region A Blu-ray of Snowpiercer, for the distinct privilege of viewing an adult oriented action drama, absent Whedon silliness, less the failure to take itself seriously enough to make us care in the least, totally removed from unnecessary apologist comedy (the ""I'm sorry my film makes no sense and doesn't tell you much of a story but, hey, Iron Man's irreverent, so it's less embarrassing for the producers, writers, director and actors"" apology standard in most action and sci-fi action films of today), we will just have to continue on reviewing Battlestar and cursing Harvey Weinstein, I mean Scissorhands, for his narcissistic obsession with sticking his film cutting hands in where they ought to be slapped away and playing with unbearable delays at the expense of the audience at large. I hate film theaters for these and other reasons and yet, I will see this at least twice, no thanks to the American distribution machine who shall remain a jerk.

Essential Point:

Don't buy the Hong Kong Region A unless you can live with permanent subtitles, not understanding dialogue or having to pause at a couple of critical moments to get subtitles back on. Do buy it if you are limited to Region A as it is the best option available for under $40 and others start at $50 not including shipping. Don't buy any non-UK region B unless you have a region free player and don't need subtitles at all but if you have one and want a region B to play in it, France is best for preserving original composition with no removal of side edges to fit your 16:9 screen and Italy is best for picture overall and is, most importantly, best for audio with a much higher quality track at double the megabytes and 24 bit rather than the standard 16 on the French release. Or, if none fit your needs but you are still interested, you can wait for the uncut Region A release due out sometime after Weinstein gets kicked in the ass by people at his company who actually like money and then realizes the Blu-ray is where that money can be made. Of course, he may never figure that out. He's not very bright. Can you tell I'm getting a little ticked after the multiyear wait? Did I mention I love Tilda Swinton in a non-creepy, non-stalker, just shy of superfan kind of way?",1401580800,16,14587,4.635344160866203

I can't say that it all made sense or was entirely plausible, but it was entertaining (and sometimes a bit bloody) and kept me interested to the very end.  Snowpiercer has an interesting concept and offers the viewer something to think about.",1531180800,,323,4.75

8649581,5,B00JBBJJ4C,"I'm a fan of Chris Evans and I was quite surprised with this purchase. His range is very good but I was totally surprised with the attention grabbing plot of the movie. You will become enthralled in the storyline, cheering on the underdogs, and hoping they achieve their goal. CHILLING!!!",1530230400,,288,4.78
