3035456,4,B000YV1KZO,"I received this dvd yesterday as a gift from my cousin, he purchased it from Amazon. He uses this one and knew that I could really benefit from this. I did my first whole dvd of moving meditations today, and when I finished, I felt like I had just received an excellent body massage. I am new to QiGong, but I have practiced Yoga and tried some Tai Chi a few years ago. I do love Yoga and can see how easily I will love QiGong as well. Lee and Garripoli are wonderful guides through the different movements, but one thing I would change is maybe to have them do a 1st run of each movement, with you just watching and then have you join in the 2nd time around. It does get a little confusing to follow exact movements when you are in motion or your head is turned away from the screen.
This is a very good dvd for beginning QiGong, but I agree with other reviewers, if there was an option to go directly to the areas that you want to focus on would make this dvd all the better.
They pick a very serene setting to shoot this dvd in and it adds to the peacefulness of this dvd. Well done there!
And as far as the price goes, you are getting 2 dvds -the instrucitonal portion and then the documentary, which is very informative as well-so this to me is well worth -in fact, I'm buying this one for other family members who I know will benefit from it as well.

I personally have no business challenging Mr. Garripoli, nor do I want to. But somewhere in my research about which DVD would be my best introduction to the vast world of Qigong I heard or read something that seemed imperative. I believe it was Mr Garripoli who implied this. The key to the movements is not the physical motion. The emphasis should be focused on the breath and visualization (connection) of the flow of Qi through the movements. Without these, the movements are simply just movement.
Although breath and visualization are mentioned throughout the video, I feel that there are times when these are neglected leaving me to guess on what the motion suggests or how to breath.
 Further, it would be a huge asset to include a segment with each movement being performed in there entirety without the pause for instructions. This could be used as a stepping stone between the early stages of learning the moves and breaking away to do your complete program without guidance.

3035462,5,B000YV1KZO,"This is one of the best Qigong videos available, for the practices as well as the production quality. And the price is great too, seeing as you're basically getting 2 DVD's worth of material for the price of one. The instructors, Francesco and Daisy Lee Garripoli, are very pleasant and peaceful to watch and follow along with. Francesco's sincerity is apparent in every movement.

Disc 1 consists of the practices. The first part is the Wuji Short Form and consists of three exercises (totaling about 15 minutes): Wuji Swimming Dragon to loosen the joints, Dragon Pearl to increase lung capacity and develop core strength, and Bagua Xun Dao Gong to stretch and strengthen the legs (that's how they're described on the back cover). These three exercise alone are a nice workout by themselves.

Next follows the Wuji Long Form, which is about 40 minutes. There are 18 exercises in this routine - an opening and closing movement and 16 inner movements (all with Chinese names like Rou, Chai, Jian, Tuoa, etc.). Once learnt, you're instructed to do the inner 16 in a random order each time you practice. Of course, you don't have to do the entire set every time, you can choose whatever exercises you want (I certainly have my favorites). As another reviewer noted, there are a lot of detailed arms-out-in-front movements and a lot of upper body focus and emphasis on stretching with the arms (more so than most Qigong I've seen or done), and a few movements are a bit complicated, which turned me off a little at first, but I have grown to love these practices anyway. They are great for the spine, and especially if you carry a lot of tension in the neck, arms or back. It's also been helpful with digestive issues and tension in the lower abdomen (there are a lot of waist twisting movements). I feel stronger every time I practice. It is truly a whole body workout and you will feel it in the best possible way.

The practices conclude with the Shaolin Self-Massage techniques, which are typically done at the end of a session, although they can be done by themselves as well: Face Washing, Scalp Massage, Ear Massage, Eye Energizing, Sinus Energizing, TMJ Relaxing, Leg Stimulation, Kidney Energizing, Rag Doll Shaking, and Toss Off Stagnant Chi.

There is also an inspiring 13-minute interview with Francesco Garripoli on Disc 1. The entirety of Disc 2 is an hour-long Qigong documentary produced by him. It's been a while since I've watched it but I thought it was excellent. In one part, you can see the 90-something year old Chinese master that taught Francesco the Wuji form doing a few of the movements. Then there is another interview with Francesco talking about the making of the doc.

The only drawback to this DVD set is that Disc 1 does not have a menu where you can go right to a certain exercise; instead you have to manually skip through each chapter, but considering how otherwise fantastic the DVD is, that's not a big deal to me. I can't understand giving it a low rating for that alone; you'd have to push as many buttons to navigate a menu anyway. I do think a practice matrix (like on a few yoga videos I've seen) would have made it absolutely perfect. Or even better, a function that automatically scrambled the inner 16 Wuji exercises so you get a different order each time you play it (since you're encouraged to do them randomly). But that's a small complaint overall. Also, although this DVD is titled as if for beginners, it's really not. It's for any level. In fact, some absolute beginners might be turned off by the relative complexity of some of the movements as well as the number of practices. If you want simpler, shorter practices check out the Garripoli's other 2 DVD's (""Qigong For Cleansing""and ""Qigong For Stress Relief""), also quite good.",1211155200,65,3780,4.712556732223903

3035487,2,B000YV1KZO,"As is the case with most Tai Chi and Qigong DVDs, the instructors do not provide a mirror image to follow but rather, you have to watch and reverse side- specific moves as they are facing you.

Why someone doesn't come out with a DVD that provides a mirror image or else with instructional prompts that are reversed making it MUCH easier to follow for participants, is a mystery to me. This is a complaint that I've read many times in reviews. And when the moves are rather quick as they are in this one and often side-specific, this would be even more helpful, especially for beginners like myself.",1411689600,,599,4.495412844036697

3035490,4,B000YV1KZO,"I have two views on this video: 1) the qigong is amazing, and 2) the DVD sucks technically.

First, the DVD. This is from GaiamTV and appears to be heavily copy protected. Perhaps that's why the first DVD failed to play on four DVD players. Amazon came through and sent me another that worked right away.

My wife and I like to watch these kind of instructional videos on our TV and follow along learning and practicing the exercises. The video is very long and is mainly in three parts. The middle part is great, a program of 18 exercises, but it is about 45-50 minutes long.

I prefer to copy these DVDs that we watch a lot and stream them to our TV through an Android Google TV set box from our computer over Ethernet. Given the high strung and temperamental nature of the DVD, I wanted my own backup and work copy. That proved to be troublesome. It took a lot of work to get the video into a video editor. I made four videos. I broke the long second part into two, each about 20-25 minutes. The problem was primarily the DRM copy protection. Yuch. What a waste of time.

The videos themselves on the DVD are very good. The best part to me was the middle section of 18 exercises. We finally got to see someone do the source of what we have seen many do parts of. This is like being able to go to China and be fortunate to study with a master who is willing to show you his or her secrets. The video content is superb.

I give this 4 stars because of the GaiamTV preciousness they seem regard as their content. I can understand not wanting to be ripped off. But, GaiamTV goes overboard. You can even see it on their web site; it is geared to signing you up and the actual watching is in a distant second place, in my experience. In fact, although I am a paying member, I cannot find a link to actually play something. A call to customer service is in order. When I did call last time, the person was semi-clueless and puzzled by the simplest things. I believe that the rep screwed it up because I could watch before.

Oh well, the content is worth it in this case.",1393718400,,2066,4.204545454545454
3035491,5,B000YV1KZO,"I begin each morning with qigong and move seamlessly to sitting meditation.  I return to the video over and over to familiarize myself with the form, and practice to deepen my contact with the form.  It flows.  Practice deepens the connection between mind, body and breath.  By the time I move sitting the link is well established.",1392076800,,331,4.754385964912281
3035492,3,B000YV1KZO,I was looking for beginner instructions and it wasn't readily apparent where they were until you watched the entire CD.  Could not tell what the earlier stuff was in beginning of CD.,1389571200,,182,4.6875

3035514,5,B000YV1KZO,"Instructor Francesco Garripoli made the bold move to quit going to medical school on a scholarship and instead study the spiritual side of healing.  When he was in a terrible car accident and put into a full body cast and told he would never walk again, he felt elation--not despair--that he could put Qigong to the test.

Qigong (pronounced ""chee-gung"") is like Tai Chi mixed with faith healing and self massage.  Initially, I felt a bit silly doing it, and then I was entertained--it reminded me a bit of that ""Dragon Ball-Z"" cartoon where characters shoot balls of light from their hands at each other for an entire episode.  Then I got into it--I was like, ""hey, I think I feel some chi moving here"".  Maybe it was the movements or the chi flowing but 2 of my cats suddenly became desperate for attention when I was doing this DVD.  One even jumped up on my shoulder and then climbed on top of my HEAD while I was doing this--and he didn't even scratch me in the process!

Qigong is a series of very gentle stretching, meditative, relaxing exercises that people of all ages and fitness levels can benefit from.  Filmed with a view of the beautiful Rocky Mountains, this well-made DVD is perfect for when you first wake up in the morning or to unwind right before bed.  The only bad thing about it is that the instructors do the exercises facing you so you have to reverse all their movements.  This was my first taste of Qigong and I am looking forward to learning more!  I would love to get my mom (who is disabled) and my husband (who has an extremely stressful job) to try it!",1370217600,,1583,4.442906574394463

3035516,3,B000YV1KZO,"I really like this video and ordered it after renting from the library a few times. It is rather long, so I don't do it as often as other workout videos. I also ordered their Qigong for Stress Relief, and it's shorter. One thing I wish they would include at the end is a quick run-through of all the movements without the instruction. I tend to fast forward through it. Better yet would be a handout in the DVD case with mini photos of the movements so you can do them when you don't have access to a DVD player.",1365984000,,512,4.13
3035517,5,B000YV1KZO,"I have used QiGong for Beginners for years and always feel my best after doing an exercise session with the Garripolis.  I took QiGong instruction locally, but when the class time changed and I was unable to attend,  I found this DVD online.  As others have said, this program is not just for beginners -- it is a great resource for ongoing practice.  I have used the DVD when I've had stressful challenges at work to recenter my energy; I use it for ongoing fitness work.  I find that every part of my body is exercised from my fingers and hands to my shoulders, neck, knees, hips and ankles.  My range of motion and coordination are enhanced by the workout.  After doing an entire routine, I feel as if I have had a wonderful massage and that all kinks are gone.  My elderly husband does it with me.  His movements are not accurate, but by doing his best he feels wonderful afterwards.

I used to do Yoga, but I like the practice and results from using this DVD better.  The movements give me the same result, but there is no danger of overextending or injury.  Although, Qigong feels gentle, don't under estimate the power these exercises have to make one more toned and fit, not to mention, more energized and centered.

Qigong may also be practiced by people who can only exercise from a seated position.  Qigong was used to help injured warriors and Chinese hospitals incorporated gentle qigong as part of patients' recovery.  For anyone with permanent or temporary disabilities, I recommend sitting on a stool and following the exercises to enhance upper body range of motion and strength.

My only problem is with the DVDs, which need to be replaced from time to time.  I would gladly pay for streaming if it were available.",1364601600,7,1732,4.607843137254902
3035518,5,B000YV1KZO,"I love this DVD!  It's clear, fluid and tranquil demonstrations of each move is easy for a beginner to follow.  It would be helpful to have a small inset screen with the camera angle behind the instructors so that the direction of the moves matches the viewers.  I got lost a couple of times so I simply rewound the DVD and repeated until I got it.  I love this so much more than my Tai Chi DVD.  I have some health issues that limit my range of motion and I was able to do almost every one of these moves and because you don't really move your feet much it's easier to focus on the upper body movements.  I felt ""peacefully energized"" after the first time following the DVD.",1363132800,3,675,4.1937984496124034

3035520,3,B000YV1KZO,"Being Completely New to Qigong I was looking for something that would teach me enough to really get started, and although I suppose this teaches you ""enough to get started"", it didn't provide me with exactly what I wanted.
I does TEACH, but that's about it (except for the added documentary, which is excellent). It teaches 8 moves I think it is, which is great, but there is a great deal of instruction (talking) with each one. Once you know them it's sort of like torture watching this again and following along. It would have been better, in my opinion, to include what it does and then have a following section or two... or three, of routines (forms) that could be done using what was learned, without all of the talking and directions. I never use it now, so it served its purpose for perhaps 2 weeks and then became obsolete.

I am sure I am more accustomed to traditional exercise videos where the teaching occurs during the usable routine, or there is a teaching section and then usable routines, so I am likely looking at this incorrectly... AND I know that once these are learned we are to use them in the order which seems best to us (that's what the video says), so... including forms created by someone else within the video could be considered wrong by those who know qigong, but for those of us who are new and learning it would have been nice to see some examples. I probably shouldn't say this but I have found more useful resources on a certain website where YOU can post videos of yourself doing just about anything from sliding down a TUBE to qigong.",1351814400,2,1570,4.489510489510489

The practices conclude with the Shaolin Self-Massage techniques, which are typically done at the end of a session, although they can be done by themselves as well: Face Washing, Scalp Massage, Ear Massage, Eye Energizing, Sinus Energizing, TMJ Relaxing, Leg Stimulation, Kidney Energizing, Rag Doll Shaking, and Toss Off Stagnant Chi.

There is also an inspiring 13-minute interview with Francesco Garripoli on Disc 1. The entirety of Disc 2 is an hour-long Qigong documentary produced by him. It's been a while since I've watched it but I thought it was excellent. In one part, you can see the 90-something year old Chinese master that taught Francesco the Wuji form doing a few of the movements. Then there is another interview with Francesco talking about the making of the doc.

The only drawback to this DVD set is that Disc 1 does not have a menu where you can go right to a certain exercise; instead you have to manually skip through each chapter, but considering how otherwise fantastic the DVD is, that's not a big deal to me. I can't understand giving it a low rating for that alone; you'd have to push as many buttons to navigate a menu anyway. I do think a practice matrix (like on a few yoga videos I've seen) would have made it absolutely perfect. Or even better, a function that automatically scrambled the inner 16 Wuji exercises so you get a different order each time you play it (since you're encouraged to do them randomly). But that's a small complaint overall. Also, although this DVD is titled as if for beginners, it's really not. It's for any level. In fact, some absolute beginners might be turned off by the relative complexity of some of the movements as well as the number of practices. If you want simpler, shorter practices check out the Garripoli's other 2 DVD's (""Qigong For Cleansing""and ""Qigong For Stress Relief""), also quite good.",1211155200,65,3780,4.712556732223903

3269984,2,B000YV1KZO,"As is the case with most Tai Chi and Qigong DVDs, the instructors do not provide a mirror image to follow but rather, you have to watch and reverse side- specific moves as they are facing you.

Why someone doesn't come out with a DVD that provides a mirror image or else with instructional prompts that are reversed making it MUCH easier to follow for participants, is a mystery to me. This is a complaint that I've read many times in reviews. And when the moves are rather quick as they are in this one and often side-specific, this would be even more helpful, especially for beginners like myself.",1411689600,,599,4.495412844036697

3269987,4,B000YV1KZO,"I have two views on this video: 1) the qigong is amazing, and 2) the DVD sucks technically.

First, the DVD. This is from GaiamTV and appears to be heavily copy protected. Perhaps that's why the first DVD failed to play on four DVD players. Amazon came through and sent me another that worked right away.

My wife and I like to watch these kind of instructional videos on our TV and follow along learning and practicing the exercises. The video is very long and is mainly in three parts. The middle part is great, a program of 18 exercises, but it is about 45-50 minutes long.

I prefer to copy these DVDs that we watch a lot and stream them to our TV through an Android Google TV set box from our computer over Ethernet. Given the high strung and temperamental nature of the DVD, I wanted my own backup and work copy. That proved to be troublesome. It took a lot of work to get the video into a video editor. I made four videos. I broke the long second part into two, each about 20-25 minutes. The problem was primarily the DRM copy protection. Yuch. What a waste of time.

The videos themselves on the DVD are very good. The best part to me was the middle section of 18 exercises. We finally got to see someone do the source of what we have seen many do parts of. This is like being able to go to China and be fortunate to study with a master who is willing to show you his or her secrets. The video content is superb.

I give this 4 stars because of the GaiamTV preciousness they seem regard as their content. I can understand not wanting to be ripped off. But, GaiamTV goes overboard. You can even see it on their web site; it is geared to signing you up and the actual watching is in a distant second place, in my experience. In fact, although I am a paying member, I cannot find a link to actually play something. A call to customer service is in order. When I did call last time, the person was semi-clueless and puzzled by the simplest things. I believe that the rep screwed it up because I could watch before.

Oh well, the content is worth it in this case.",1393718400,,2066,4.204545454545454

3270011,5,B000YV1KZO,"Instructor Francesco Garripoli made the bold move to quit going to medical school on a scholarship and instead study the spiritual side of healing.  When he was in a terrible car accident and put into a full body cast and told he would never walk again, he felt elation--not despair--that he could put Qigong to the test.

Qigong (pronounced ""chee-gung"") is like Tai Chi mixed with faith healing and self massage.  Initially, I felt a bit silly doing it, and then I was entertained--it reminded me a bit of that ""Dragon Ball-Z"" cartoon where characters shoot balls of light from their hands at each other for an entire episode.  Then I got into it--I was like, ""hey, I think I feel some chi moving here"".  Maybe it was the movements or the chi flowing but 2 of my cats suddenly became desperate for attention when I was doing this DVD.  One even jumped up on my shoulder and then climbed on top of my HEAD while I was doing this--and he didn't even scratch me in the process!

Qigong is a series of very gentle stretching, meditative, relaxing exercises that people of all ages and fitness levels can benefit from.  Filmed with a view of the beautiful Rocky Mountains, this well-made DVD is perfect for when you first wake up in the morning or to unwind right before bed.  The only bad thing about it is that the instructors do the exercises facing you so you have to reverse all their movements.  This was my first taste of Qigong and I am looking forward to learning more!  I would love to get my mom (who is disabled) and my husband (who has an extremely stressful job) to try it!",1370217600,,1583,4.442906574394463

I also ordered their Qigong for Stress Relief, and it's shorter. One thing I wish they would include at the end is a quick run-through of all the movements without the instruction. I tend to fast forward through it. Better yet would be a handout in the DVD case with mini photos of the movements so you can do them when you don't have access to a DVD player.",1365984000,,512,4.13
3270014,5,B000YV1KZO,"I have used QiGong for Beginners for years and always feel my best after doing an exercise session with the Garripolis.  I took QiGong instruction locally, but when the class time changed and I was unable to attend,  I found this DVD online.  As others have said, this program is not just for beginners -- it is a great resource for ongoing practice.  I have used the DVD when I've had stressful challenges at work to recenter my energy; I use it for ongoing fitness work.  I find that every part of my body is exercised from my fingers and hands to my shoulders, neck, knees, hips and ankles.  My range of motion and coordination are enhanced by the workout.  After doing an entire routine, I feel as if I have had a wonderful massage and that all kinks are gone.  My elderly husband does it with me.  His movements are not accurate, but by doing his best he feels wonderful afterwards.

I used to do Yoga, but I like the practice and results from using this DVD better.  The movements give me the same result, but there is no danger of overextending or injury.  Although, Qigong feels gentle, don't under estimate the power these exercises have to make one more toned and fit, not to mention, more energized and centered.

Qigong may also be practiced by people who can only exercise from a seated position.  Qigong was used to help injured warriors and Chinese hospitals incorporated gentle qigong as part of patients' recovery.  For anyone with permanent or temporary disabilities, I recommend sitting on a stool and following the exercises to enhance upper body range of motion and strength.

My only problem is with the DVDs, which need to be replaced from time to time.  I would gladly pay for streaming if it were available.",1364601600,7,1732,4.607843137254902

I have some health issues that limit my range of motion and I was able to do almost every one of these moves and because you don't really move your feet much it's easier to focus on the upper body movements.

3270017,3,B000YV1KZO,"Being Completely New to Qigong I was looking for something that would teach me enough to really get started, and although I suppose this teaches you ""enough to get started"", it didn't provide me with exactly what I wanted.
I does TEACH, but that's about it (except for the added documentary, which is excellent). It teaches 8 moves I think it is, which is great, but there is a great deal of instruction (talking) with each one. Once you know them it's sort of like torture watching this again and following along. It would have been better, in my opinion, to include what it does and then have a following section or two... or three, of routines (forms) that could be done using what was learned, without all of the talking and directions. I never use it now, so it served its purpose for perhaps 2 weeks and then became obsolete.

I am sure I am more accustomed to traditional exercise videos where the teaching occurs during the usable routine, or there is a teaching section and then usable routines, so I am likely looking at this incorrectly... AND I know that once these are learned we are to use them in the order which seems best to us (that's what the video says), so... including forms created by someone else within the video could be considered wrong by those who know qigong, but for those of us who are new and learning it would have been nice to see some examples. I probably shouldn't say this but I have found more useful resources on a certain website where YOU can post videos of yourself doing just about anything from sliding down a TUBE to qigong.",1351814400,2,1570,4.489510489510489
