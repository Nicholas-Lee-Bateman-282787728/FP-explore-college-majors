8610975,3,B0001US664,"AMANTES (also known as LOVERS and as YA NO LOS HACEN COMO ANTES) is a low budget film made in Mexico by director Vicente Aranda.  Once again it is apparent that good stories with heart can survive even the most stringent budgetary restraints: Aranda's film is tender, well acted, and has a voice of freshness that is a welcome change in contemporary cinema.

The story revolves around the recent death of the matriarch of a Mexican family and how that family brings closure to their loss and finds entry into the changes that occur.  Benito (Gonzalo Vega) is the widower, and while he misses his wife he continues to be supportive to his grown children while maintaining his business in automobile repair.  His daughters  are married except for Perla (Itati Cantoral) who loves one of her father's workers named Bruno (Eduardo Santamarina) but does not want the commitment of marriage.  Into this warm family's life drives Genoveva (Silvia Pinal) in an old, sentimentally valuable Ford that will take its driver no further.  Benito and his workers agree to restore the car, Benito begins to fall for Genoveva and despite everyone's fear that he is acting to soon after his wife's death to be courting a new woman, he asks her to marry him. This is the trigger for the resolution of many of his family's quiet problems, but in the end Benito's marriage to Genoveva brings changes that surprise them all.  The reason for the importance of the sentimental value of the old Ford is revealed in a heartwarming way.

The characters are well drawn, the settings match the story, and the only real problem with the DVD is the sound: where is the Dolby filter when it is most needed?!  In all, a lovely little movie for a feel good evening's entertainment.",1096416000,4,1747,4.735973597359736
