8669904,5,B00M2MYHRG,"Plays perfectly on my Oppo Multi-region Blu-ray/DVD player.  the disc is pressed, not burned.

An interesting movie about the challenges facing a World War I flying squadron after the war. Surprisingly good special effects. In some of the crash scenes I would pause the movie and rewind a bit looking for wires etc.  I could find none. Very well done.

This movie briefly dealt with the fact that pilots in World War I were intentionally not provided with parachutes. It was falsely believed that if you gave a pilot a parachute he might be more inclined to jump if things got too hot. In World War II, pilots were provided with parachutes but never used them unless absolutely necessary.

I'm glad to have this movie in my DVD/Blu-ray collection.",1458691200,5,747,4.75968992248062
8669905,4,B00M2MYHRG,"4 buddy WWI pilots, out of work after the war, start doing stunt flying on a Hollywood movie, directed by the evil Eric Von Stroheim (in an enjoyably over the top performance).  Of course, as absurd luck would have it the leader of the squads ex-girlfriend is now married to Von Stroheim, though she hates him.

Spoilers ahead!

Von Stroheim plots to try to get his wifes ex-lover killed in an impossible stunt, and is going to make sure by putting acid on the control cables, but another flyer goes in his place and dies, and the remaining 3 grab Von Stroheim to get their revenge, leading to a tense, dark but pretty silly conclusion. Theres a lot thats cool here.  The photography is quite nice, with a modern, flowing feeling unusual in early sound films.  The last third of the film has a dark, moody sort of proto film noir  look and feel.  And the performances are pretty retrained and naturalistic for early 30s  Hollywood as well.  It only grew on a 2nd viewing.",1446940800,5,971,4.502857142857143
