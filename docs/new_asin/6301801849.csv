373121,5,6301801849,"I like the movie How To Eat Fried Worms. It is about a boy that ate worms. The characters are Joe, Chris, and Naylor. It takes place in the present. I like it because it is funny and it is cool and makes me laugh. My brother liked the movie and my mom because they laughed the entire time. I give the movie a thumbs up!",1160956800,3,319,3.8484848484848486
373122,3,6301801849,"How to Eat Fried Worms (Bob Dolman, 2006)

Here's your daily ""what were they thinking?"" factoid: How to Eat Fried Worms is banned in Malaysia. Yes, I'm serious.

In a case of true chip-off-the-old-block-dom, my daughter has started writing movie reviews for her middle school paper, so it's up to me to start taking her to all the movies her mother and stepmother have no desire (and rightly, so, many times) to see. At the top of the list was How to Eat Fried Worms. Now, Thomas Rockwell was one of my favorite authors in middle school, both for this wonderful novel and for his much more obscure (and now long out of print) and even more brilliant The Portmanteau Book. Given that, and the decidedly lukewarm reviews to be had, I went into this fearing the worst. And I must say, I didn't get it. I grant you, this movie could have been miles better, especially had it been more faithful to the book. But, you know, for a dumbed-down brought-up-to-date movie based on a kids' book, it's not half bad.

Billy (Because of Winn-Dixie's Luke Benward) is the new kid at school, and as such is immediately picked on by the local team of bullies, headed up by Joe (The Shaggy Dog's Adam Hicks). Really, all you need to know is that the two of them end up making a bet that Billy can't eat ten worms in the space of a day. There's also a kinda-sorta romantic subplot between Billy and Erika (Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the Pepsi girl), who gets roped into watching Billy's little brother during the contest, but it gets relegated to the back burner pretty quick.

I think a lot of the negative reaction to the movie is coming simply because it's an adaptation of a classic kids' book, and not a really great one. And there's a case to be made that if you're going to adapt a great book, you need to turn it into a great movie. I also think that argument is pure bunk. A book and a movie are two entirely separate things, and sometimes you just have to look at them as such. (Consider the 1974 Tobe Hooper adaptation of 'Salem's Lot.) If this weren't an adaptation of Thomas Rockwell's novel, what would we be saying about it? That it plays into the gross-factor? (Better with worms than with the infantile potty humor of The Ant Bully.) That the motivations of its characters are shallow and silly? (Compared to Cars, these characters are as well-drawn as any major character in War and Peace.) That it's episodic and overly simplistic? (Three words: Over the Hedge.)

Comparatively, this is one of the best kids' movies we've seen this year, though I'm certainly willing to concede that it's just been an awful year for kids' movies. It does have just about everything it needs to attract the pre-teen set, though you might want to consider whether you want your eight-year-old running around yelling ""sphincter!"" all day afterwards. ** ",1160956800,16,2828,4.568047337278107
373123,5,6301801849,"My wife and I took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film. It has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film and especially Hallie Kate Eisenberg's refrain, ""Boys are so weird."" It's refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend, myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out. We had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it. It's clean and delightfully acted by a pre-adolescent cast reminiscent of the TV Classic ""Freaks and Geeks"". We all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the ""Freaks & Geeks"" which didn't survive its first season but sold-out its DVD release. Do see it especially if you have boys and you'll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! Girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say, ""Boys are so weird!"" Don't miss it...",1159142400,6,1232,4.48
373124,5,6301801849,"It's funny. The bet cracked me up. That is a little gross. But it's also very funny. Kids will enjoy it, but don't take your younger kids.",1159056000,2,138,4.148148148148148
373125,5,6301801849,"Ok, not exactly the most ""tasteful"" subject, but its a children's movie, and children do have an interest in ""grossing"" others out.  Basically harmless fun for kids and fun for adults to watch with them thinking back to the days when they were just like them.",1159056000,,259,4.630434782608695
373126,5,6301801849,"How To Eat Fried Worms is another enjoyable, fun and simple tale from Walden Media. The story centers around a classroom bully, and how a new kid at school deals with his antics.

The acting and cast are wonderful, and filled with many unique characters. Just looking at many of the kids will have you smiling or laughing.

While the movie centers around a disgusting topic (eating worms), it is at heart a story not about a worm eating contest, but about how children come together and do the right thing in the face of a repressive bully.

Children will love this film, as it allows them to process the handling of difficult school mates in a healthy and fun way. Push past the ""ick"" factor and take your family to see this film. It will leave you laughing, thinking and feeling good that you have seen it.

One final note: some reviews will put down How To Eat Fried Worms because it involves a disgusting subject. Anyone who has had children knows how they love to talk about icky things and body functions. My nephew and daughter both loved the film because it allowed kids to be kids, and see things that kids love to see and talk about. All this and a wonderful story as well.

Another gem from Walden.

373127,4,6301801849,"My husband and I took our [...] boys to see this movie and we all had a great time! First, the name of the movie is ""How To Eat Fried Worms"" so OBVIOUSLY there's a gross factor that most kids are going to love! The movie itself is about a little boy who moves to a new town and is immediately picked on by the bully of the school. He confronts the bully only to find himself agreeing to a bet which requires him to eat 10 worms. The process of eating the worms becomes a journey for all the children in the movie, including the bully. The lesson is one kids both young and old will understand and appreciate. Kids will identify with the characters and the dilemma they find themselves in and they will cheer when in the end, the boys all become best of friends. It was funny and it had a great message. Take your kids and enjoy!!!!",1156550400,3,831,4.135802469135802

373341,2,6301801849,"I'm pretty surprised by all the positive reviews. This movie missed the best parts of the book. If you want to show your kids a good example of bullying and how NOT to treat people, than this provides plenty of examples. One of the charming things about the book was that a group of good friends created this gross little bet, and you kind of see the best and the worst of each personality. The characters are easy to relate to, and even with the bad behavior you can kind of relate to their desperation. The movie is horrible...you basically see the worst in everybody, and even Billy is a bully. I didn't like any of the characters. It could have been so much better.",1462665600,,669,4.36

The movie is not faithful to the book at all and takes a story about the challenges friends do to each other to strengthen their friendships and turns the plot into a movie about bullying and humiliation. I am reading the story aloud to a group of 3rd graders (with minor changes to be PC in 2016) but I will not show this film. An enterprising producer should make a 90-minute movie adaptation that is faithful to the book and market it to educational publishers as a book-movie class set.

373737,2,6301801849,"When I watch films like this, I am looking for three things. I hope to find some young talent, before anyone else knows who they are, a unique story, and a funny scene or two. Unfortunately, the story here is quite disgusting and there weren't any stand out performances, but there was a really funny scene, where the nerdy kid gets caught playing dance dance revolution. The story begins when a new kid named Billy (Luke Benward) moves to town. The other kids immediately try to intimidate him, by replacing his lunch with a bag of worms. To their surprise, in defiance, Billy eats the worms and gains their respect. One thing leads to another and eventually a very disgusting competition is born. The film is based on a very popular children's book and that's really who this film was intended for. Occasionally, you get some surprises out of a film like this, but as I said earlier, there really wasn't any stand out talent here. I didn't find any young actors/actresses that I could start following from the beginning of their career, but the kids weren't bad either. They seemed to have a lot of fun with the strange story and ultimately I think kids will probably really enjoy it.

373973,1,6301801849,"Last night I took my 8 yo daughter to see this movie.  Now, I'm a gross-loving sort, but this movie was not just about the gross factor.  Sure, there are lots of great scenes about how to cook up them worms.  That part I had no problem with.  It was the other messages the film sent that disturbed me.  #1 no child wore a helmet while bicycling.  #2 the parents were shown as ineffective adults with poor coping skills.  #3 the ultimate moral seems to be ""If you can't beat them, join them.""  The underdog cannot fight the stronger bullies and ultimately succumbs to their demands.  #4 the underdog succeeds by lowering the bullies position.  This does not raise the underdog up, it merely lowers the bar of acceptable behavior.

I was disappointed in the lessons.  The movie teaches that the only way to get along is to allow onesself to act in an unacceptable and disgusting manner.  It shows that the only way to feel good and become a part of the group is by lowering your standards and the standards of others.  Parental involvement was minimal and seen as a joke.  And, forget about safety.

This movie has given me a rich opening to discuss bullying, safety, and how to be comfortable with yourself with my daughter.  It has so many examples of what is done wrong.",1268438400,8,1271,4.4803493449781655

374049,3,6301801849,"Billy and his family have just moved to a new town and Billy is forced to attend a new school where he doesn't fit in. Following a run in with the school bully, Billy accepts a dare to eat ten worms in a single day. The rest of the film is simply low-grade gross-out humour that would appeal immensely to 7 year olds, and those suffering from arrested development.

The first half hour (up until the worm eating begins) is slow and not all that funny, I could imagine many children losing interest (I almost gave up), but once the worm eating begins the film picks up a lot. Even though I am about 20 years older than the target audience for this film (I'm 27), I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat to see if Billy would eat all of the worms. Well, not really, but I was still interested in knowing what would happen next and how the film would end. The writer and director did manage to get as much suspense into the film as was possible and for that I applaud them.

My biggest problem with the film was the one token female character, Erika. The sole purpose of this character seems to be to act as a mother to the young male characters in the film and not to participate in any of the fun, simply because she is a girl. Speaking as a female, I was insulted and I don't think this is a good message to send to young girls or young boys. I don't think it would have bothered me if she had been excluded entirely from the film, I can accept that it is realistic that young boys might not want to play with girls, but if girls and boys are being shown playing together, I don't think it is a nice to send the message that girls aren't as fun as boys. You may be thinking that I'm saying this just because I'm an adult, but this was also how I felt when I was a child.

This film is not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon, but you are probably better off renting it rather than buying it. Somehow, I don't think this film is going to become a children's classic.",1206403200,,1972,4.090439276485788
374050,5,6301801849,"How To Eat Fried Worms I believe is based off the popular book about a child who had to eat 10 worms.  It was a popular book my library teacher in 5th grade used to read to me all the time, along with my reading teachers.  The class loved it as well.

The movie takes everything we loved about the book and makes it just as gross and disgusting as the story!  In the movie, a little boy eats worms in very creative ways.  He fries them, and throughout the story, the little boy (who is forced to eat 10 worms by a school bully) learns to accept them.  At first, the boy is naturally unwilling to eat them, because they're WORMS and that would be extremely gross!  But he eventually comes around and finds they aren't quite as bad as he originally thought.  The school bully was, of course, just as mean as you'd expect someone of that age to be.

374094,5,6301801849,"I think this humorous, coming-of-age story was especially good because it also showed the father struggling to fit in at his new job, as well as the struggles the child went through.  It gave the realistic truth that even grown-ups deal with peer pressure and forms of 'bullies' in daily life.  It is something we deal with in all stages of life sometimes, so it was wonderful to see characters face challenges and come out relatively unscathed (except for a little indigestion).  A great movie adapted from a wonderful book!

374095,4,6301801849,"How To Eat Fried Worms is the classic story of the ""New Kid"" who has to go out of his way to fit in at a new school.  I personally do not usually find children's movies to be enjoyable.  This movie however is amusing, entertaining and even funny at times.  These children are extraordinarily good actors and their realism sucks you into the story and helps you to empathize with the main character.  The story is great and made even more amusing by the premise of having to eat worms.  This DVD also has some great bonus features, one of which is how they made the worms that were eaten in the movie (no, they didn't eat real worms).  If you have a young kid or are just a child at heart, give this movie a try!",1186876800,,711,4.153284671532846
374096,4,6301801849,"*How to Eat Fried Worms* is a gem of a movie that is rarely seen among today's films.

Billy is the new kid at school.  One thing that you got to know is that Billy has such a weak stomach.  Mere sights of anything out of the ordinary (icky stuff) is going to trigger the gag reflex or the medulla oblongata in him.  Motion (as in the car) isn't his best friend.

Of course, what or whom does every new kid encounter on their first day at school?  Yep, that annoying bully.  Joe, having his bully tactics countered by Billy, challenges Billy to eat 10 worms on a certain day within a time limit.  Of course, Billy isn't entirely innocent.  He had bragged earlier that eating worms was a piece of cake.  Now, on the spot, Billy has no choice but to shake on the bet.

However, not only does Billy deals with Joe, the bully, but so does Joe's gang.  While they cook up disgusting ways to cook worms for Billy, they can't help but cheer him on.

This is a wonderful film.  It's been a long time since we've seen anything similar about a gang of boys on an adventure since *The Goonies*.  Check it out, sit back and enjoy the adventures of a gang of boys dealing with friendship.

Oh yeah, good to see that Pepsi girl, Hallie Kate Eisenberg.  She's so tall!",1185494400,,1253,4.241525423728813

It's gross, but it's also a bunch of boys so it's perfectly understandable.  That's what it was made for anyway.  If you're looking for a good family film, then you might try this one.

Kids thought the book was better. Nevertheless, I have to say they really enjoyed the movie, even when I could not enjoy it as much. I had kids from 3rd, 4th and 5th grade and they really liked it.

374100,4,6301801849,"It's hard to call a film cute when the story revolves around a kid eating worms in a variety of ways, but certainly there's a lot to this film once you look beyond the whole yuck factor.  It actually succeeds in turning worm-eating into a metaphor that resonates with meaning for adults as well as children, for we all have to eat a worm or two every so often (again, metaphorically) as part of life.  It's all about how we project ourselves, and how honest we are to ourselves and those around us - especially those we really want to impress.  What I'm trying to say is How to Eat Fried Worms is actually a wholesome film with a number of important life lessons to impart to viewers.

It's never easy being the new kid in school, largely because of that one bully who makes it his mission to harass and establish his dominance over everyone - especially newbies.  For Billy (Luke Benward), it starts with a major glaring session upon arrival and quickly builds up to a thermos filled not with a delicious Kool-Aid type drink but a whole gob of nasty, disgusting worms, all of it courtesy of Joe (Adam Hicks), who sits atop the classmate food chain.  Billy makes the spontaneous decision to play it cool, claiming that he eats worms all the time, then closes with a perfect toss of one worm into Joe's face.  Yes, it looks like a small triumph for the little guy over the big bad bully, but the resulting taunts of ""Worm boy"" soon compel Billy to make the fatal mistake of ""the bet.""  Before he knows what he's doing, he's bet Joe that he can eat ten worms on Saturday, with the loser having to come to school with a bucket load of worms in his pants.

As Billy's new friend Erika (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) often says, boys are just weird.  Joe's gang goes all out to come up with some of the most disgusting fried worm delicacies they can imagine (don't ask me why they think it's harder to eat a fried worm than a squishy live one).  The levers of power shift as Billy manages to stay in the game, everyone seems to learn something about himself along the way, and the outcome of the bet doesn't seem all that important when all is said and done.  Don't judge anyone too quickly stands among this film's various lessons to all of us, but it will obviously play best to boys and girls who can personally relate to the vagaries of playground dominance that give rise to such silly yet all-important contests as Billy's worm-eating challenge.",1175817600,,2439,4.431767337807607
374101,3,6301801849,I gave it 3 stars because it did make my kids laugh. But over all they were disappointed. I had them read the book first which they thought was much better. The only thing it really had in common with the book is that a kid made a bet to eat worms other than that forget it. I could not bring myself to watch the whole move. The part I disliked the most was that the main character and his little brother hate each other which was entirely uncalled for.,1172620800,,453,4.044444444444444
374102,4,6301801849,"This was a family movie night feature, as are all Walden Media offerings.  You never have to worry about watching one of their productions with the kids.

Anyway, this basically looked like a made-for-Disney Channel movie.  It was fairly low-budget, which meant that the acting had to carry the water.  I think these young actors did very well in their roles.  It was refreshing to see kids playing outside all over town instead of being glued to some type of screen.  The bullies were not physically abusive (or even cruel hearted) as in so many of these *new kid in town* themes.  The parents were not complete idiots either, which was refreshing.  James Rebhorn as principal Boilerhead ripped his role off from James Tolkan, who played the principal in Back To The Future.

Bottom line, my 14 and 16 year-olds liked this movie, the fetching Mrs. Brew and I thought is was just OK.  I'll have to admit, my stomach was queasy for some time after watching kids eat worms for 1 1/2 hours.",1172102400,,987,4.620689655172414

374156,3,6301801849,"This is a kids movie in every sense of the term. So, as a guy in his mid-twenties, it's really unfair of me to review this movie. That being said, I'm going to anyway. I'm just going to review it as to what it ""seems"" like to me, rather than if it's a movie that I really liked or would want to see again.

How to Eat Fried Worms seems like a movie that young kids (maybe 10 and under) will love. Everything is very G-rated, where even the bullies of the school are pretty much white-bread suburban kids and not actual tough guys. Gross out humor, slapstick comedy, and silly sound effects abound. Even the scenes involving the parents are geared towards kids. And by the end all the kids learn a valuable lesson about friendship and sticking up for yourself and all that.

The best part of the movie is the main character's little brother Woody. That little kid is hilarious. Other than that, this film doesn't have much to offer anyone over the age of 12, but since it's clearly not made for anyone over the age of 12, that's not really a drawback, is it? If you're looking for a good family movie, then this is it. If you're not, then this isn't it.

I checked it out because it was filmed in Austin, but the film keeps the location pretty generic.",1170028800,,1251,4.2923728813559325
374157,2,6301801849,"I saw a few people had posted they wanted to know who sang the song at the end of the movie. Ok...I think I might have found you an answer. The one I was thinking of is called ""Move your Feet"" by Junior Senior.",1168387200,2,210,3.7954545454545454
374158,4,6301801849,"Loosely based on the book (which my son also loved). The main character is about 12 and moves at the begining of the movie. He encounters a bully on the first day of school who hides worms in his lunch box. This later escalates into a bet that he can eat 10 worms in one day. A hilarious Saturday is spent with a group of 8-10 boys collecting & cooking worms while being kicked out of various parks, homes, etc. The movie ends with everyone being friends.

Most of the humor is of the sort that appeals to boys of this age but I laughed too. Secondary story lines involve the little brother (around 4), a neighborhood girl (who is teased about her height), and dad's new job. The group of boys includes all types (athletes, computer geeks, shy, outgoing, etc.) so it is nice to see them working together.

The DVD has a good behind the scenes documentary that interviews the child actors, the guy who made the fake worms, the special effects people that ""microwaved"" a worm, etc. My son really enjoyed it as well.",1168300800,4,1013,4.411764705882353

374160,3,6301801849,"In an effort to balance the many dramas, romantic comedies and thrillers available on DVD with let's-really-laugh comedy, I have tried to order a comedy every so often. This isn't easy since 1) I am not particularly easy to please when it comes to comedic films and 2) there seem to be far fewer good comedies than there are good films in the other genres. Therefore, I take more chances. In doing so, one of the things I have learned is that movies for kids can be a lot of fun - for adults. Having just finished watching this one, I am pleased to be able to add it to a relatively short list of kid movies that made me laugh at least a few times - partly because, like all men, there is a little boy still lurking in the not-so-very-deep recesses of my being, and partly because this film reminds me that certain themes are universal - and that films made for kids are about many of the same things that films made for adults are about. They are just told differently.

In this case, the core theme is about bullies, being new in town and doing what is hard to do - because it is both necessary and right. Sound familiar? Apart from the four or five adult characters - all played as being completely useless, clueless and ineffectual in their respective 'jobs,' the cast is entirely made up of kids who appear to be in the range of 9-12 years old. The adults, of course, have NO idea what is really going on and the bully, as is the case with every good Morality Play written since the dark ages, gets his just deserts. Not, however, with true suffering and pain - but with humor and a resolution that includes an friendship that seems highly improbable for most of the film.

There is a heroine - one of the kids and the only girl amongst the principal players.

To tell more about the plot would be to destroy the story for potential viewers.

Suffice it to say that this is a film you can watch with your own kids or grandkids (ages 8 and up I would think would be OK) - and they will appreciate the humor at their own level - and you, as adults, will have a good time watching both the film and the child's enjoyment of it.

It may help to take a look at a currently popular paperback about things adults commonly tend to regard as disgusting (like boogers, for example) but which kids find profoundly interesting and worthwhile! When you see it on a bookstore shelf, you'll recognize it immediately.

Have some fun with your young kids (or grandkids), rent or buy this one, put on some popcorn and enjoy a family night at home with a movie with a little something for everyone - both kids and you adults who can recall having ever been one!",1168041600,,2647,4.305220883534137

374162,1,6301801849,"They have absolutely massacred a classic children's book to make this movie.  The story has been turned on its head.  In the book, young Billy and his friend making a bet that challenges their friendship.  Over the course of 15 days - a worm a day - Billy and his friends come to learn a great deal about themselves and what is important in life.  Billy is largely in control of his own destiny as he grapples with each day's preparation of said worm.  The movie removes this friendship and instead sets up an overused and trite dynamic between Billy, now the new kid in school, and the class bully. The worms are all eaten in one day, prepared in a number of sadistic ways by the bully and his cronies.  The adults are all buffoons, straight out of central casting. The life lessons are subsumed to a bunch of tired kid movie cliches, including bullies, gross out humor and stupid adults. This movie is worse than awful, as it destroys a timeless book.",1165968000,11,953,4.448275862068965
374163,5,6301801849,"Screenwriter-director Bob Dolman lets his cast be themselves, and that's what makes How to Eat Fried Worms delicious fun for adults and children. Authentic and energetic performances from the pre-teen stars make for captivating watching, as new kid Billy (Benward) gets wrangled into a bet to eat 10 worms in a day by local bully Joe (Hicks). What he doesn't know is Joe's gang is concocting horrible ways to cook those worms. Liver juice and blended broccoli top the ingredients.

Mixed in with this groovy gag-worthy plot hook are great strands of parents trying to help kids adjust to new situations, girls trying to be friends with gross boys, siblings learning to like each other, and the redemption of bullies who really aren't that bad. Benward does a great job of conveying the terror of a new school and trying to find new friends, while such enemies-turned-friend as the spastic Twitch, the dancing Adam Simms and the theatrical chef Benjy will have all ages in stiches. Helping these on-screen bursts of energy is a wacky score by Devo leader Mark Mothersbaugh.

Kids' movies that don't dumb down the pain of loneliness, bullying and growing up always deserve praise, and Dolman's concocted a winner out of the cute 1953 source material.

DVD Extras: The extras are all kid-friendly and get my adult-approved stamp. A chef shows how he cooks up ""worms"" for consumption by Benward (cheesecake taste helps). A blooper reel, deleted scenes and a promotional making-of featurette are cute and fast-paced. New Line's DVD-ROM-accessible DVD player lets curious fans search for moments of worm cooking and consumption as well as words in the script and then jump right to those moments in the film.",1164240000,11,1702,4.985915492957746
