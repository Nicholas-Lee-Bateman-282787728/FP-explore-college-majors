8550043,5,B00AD9TBC6,"I was told about this movie during my recent visit to the Ukraine. Apparently this movie is our equivalent of ""it's a Wonderful Life"" in the respect that it is shown during the Christmas holidays. I do not want to give away the story but it is a political satire of the time during the 70's and comical situation. I loved the first part and was very anxious to see the second. The second takes place 30 years later and a similar situation. Great cast, great acting.",1375488000,3,465,4.35632183908046
