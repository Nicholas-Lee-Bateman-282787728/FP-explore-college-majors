8323601,2,B000FII2FC,"Neither synopsis nor background material are provided. The music, staging and performances are attractive. The opera is apparently about complex interpersonal relationships. Since I could hardly understand a word of what was sung, even though it was in English, throughout the opera I didn't know what was going on! Had there been subtitles I would have been able to decide wheither the action is really relevant or is much to do about nothing. Operas in English need subtitles in English!",1161734400,8,489,5.125
