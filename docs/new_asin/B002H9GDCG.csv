8370210,5,B002H9GDCG,I saw Eastern College at a special screening in Chicago and really loved it. The film is a hilariously poignant; if you've ever stayed up until 4:00 am doing whip-its or passed out in an empty kiddie pool then you will surely agree. It's not a callow slacker movie of the Apatow variety though. It's directed with a sense of confidence and maturity and definitely earns artistic merit. James Francis Flynn is definitely a director in the independent film world to keep your eye on.,1253836800,,481,4.670588235294118
8370211,5,B002H9GDCG,"This is a clever, honest college movie that manages to be funny, touching and hopeful without even attempting to be another Animal House or PCU.  It's relevant and real and very enjoyable.

James Francis Flynn is an extremely talented writer/director. If his first feature is this good, I'm very much looking forward to what comes next!",1248134400,,336,4.982142857142857
8370212,4,B002H9GDCG,"I fell in love with this movie when I saw it a few months ago and I'm glad to see that it's finally getting a DVD release.  There isn't much to say other than anyone who likes coming-of-age comedies should really give this film a chance.  It's funny, it's got heart and the actors are all really amazing (especially Noah Applebaum who is so funny).

Give this one a look, it's worth it...",1247443200,,388,4.287671232876712
8370213,5,B002H9GDCG,Saw Eastern College at a film festival a while back and was really taken with how honest and real the comedy was.  The story is pretty standard (a bunch of guys just out of college are directionless) but what makes the movie amazing is how real the characters feel and how funny the movie is.  Writer/director James Francis Flynn really did an amazing job.,1247443200,,356,4.546875
