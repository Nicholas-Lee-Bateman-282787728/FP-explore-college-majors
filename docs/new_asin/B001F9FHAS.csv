3566291,5,B001F9FHAS,"This film doesn't go out of its way to be preachy or to portray the Christian POV as anything but loving. A good decision --it will appeal to a much broader audience than if it had made either side out to be ""wrong.""

Great acting. The characters aren't stereotypical representations of themselves -- they're all just regular people.

Thank you, Chad, Robert and Judith, for telling this story.",1235520000,,394,4.779411764705882
3566292,3,B001F9FHAS,"Interesting independent film, with pretty good acting most of the time. Chad Allen showed more promise as an actor here than in ""End of the Spear."" Judith Light exhibits her talents well. The story line is a bit too formulaic - troubled drug-addicted gay guy with alley-cat sex life gets plopped into Christian help center, meets guy, straightens out his head (but not his orientation) and falls into relationship, develops positive outlook, leaves. No demonization here, not too much moralization one way or t'other, decent photography, editing and sound. Worth a view, possibly a second if you want to share, but Netflix rental seems most appropriate, especially given the inflated price.",1234915200,8,690,5.225225225225225
3566293,5,B001F9FHAS,"I love Chad Allen and he is at his best in this film about a young gay man, addicted to drugs and suicidal, who is sent to a group home, ""Genesis House,"" which specializes in treating gay men and, along with treating their addiction issues, tries to get them to go ""straight,"" primarily with religious doctrine.

Judith Light is oustanding and remarkable as the founder of Genesis House, it's soul and backbone, constantly full of doctrinal advice for every situation, always on the alert for threats.  That she is actually genuine and well-meaning (and even loving) in her continuous espousal of homophobia makes this film more effective and more complex by magnitudes of order.

Each charcter is fully portrayed with both their darker and better sides, and nobody is particularly villainous, even if their actions have dire consequences for the people they purport to be protecting.

Robert Gant is also outstanding, as usual, and he and Chad Allen find themselves seeing in each other what they are forbidden, at Genesis House, to see, and therein lies the primary conflict.

This is an affecting and moving film that is both challenging and a joy to see.  I don't think anybody should miss it; it's not a light, funny film to entertain you as much as it's a thoughtful film that you'll want to discuss and ultimately embrace.",1233964800,2,1329,4.8584070796460175
3566294,4,B001F9FHAS,"((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form.  Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so.))

This is NOT a gay romance, or gay love story (even though there was a kiss and some meaningful / longing looks). I never developed a feeling I was seeing true romantic love. However, I was often noting something that purported to be religious love. So, no, you're not going to see any memorably well-done love scenes such as witnessed in the movie, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter/dp/B0013D8LCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter</a>"" (definitely need more films like that one). Instead, this is a ""Message Film"".....a tale of persons / organizations who aim to remold who people are----to remake people's innermost selves. BUT.......as a viewer you should remain aware that, in the end, such a goal is not going to be successful. Still, there will be cases / instances of supposedly successful personality change presented in order to convince us otherwise (just know that if personality alterations are brought about, they will be surface ones only).

Through the way this film has been set up, and especially in its ending, it is almost as though we are being expected to just accept that a deep romantic love was / had been taking place. Well, I'm sorry; I didn't sense it happening between characters, Mark and Scott. Lips meeting, dancing with one another, building bird houses together are not enough for me; they are all just surface acts. The two actors filling these roles weren't able to produce that ""magic""......that ""whatever-it-is"" which I was given in the film, ""Shelter."" In that movie, I knew I had watched love begin and grow. (Interesting then, isn't it, that ""Shelter"" contains the heterosexual leads and ""Save Me"" the gay ones). Admittedly, I do recognize that perhaps most of ""Save Me"" was not written / planned to focus on a ""couple"" but, rather, was aimed at exposing overzealousness by some in the religious community and their need to ""reform"" homosexuals. Having said this, I'll now step aside and leave commenting on that aspect of this production to filmgoers far more qualified than I.

As to the performers, a subject on which I'm able to comment: Judith Light is near-phenomenal (you'll never, never, ever relate her to that TV ""Ugly Betty"" role). Here, before your very eyes, she BECOMES the message of this film. No one else can touch her. We can see Chad Allen trying, as we watch him with her in their one-on-one scenes. Sitting together in a truck at one point, we can almost see his efforts to absorb and keep up with what Light is putting out there----a special ability of hers that not all actors possess. Yet, in his own way, Allen does acquit himself quite well in this film. Then.....there's Robert Gant: I've followed much of Bobby's performing, from his 2002 ""Providence"" (TV) performance, on up to today. My best impression / description of his acting style is that it's a ""tentative"" one; he's tentative, subdued. It's like you're always waiting for him to break out----but he almost never take you to that point. In the end, that's frustrating for an audience. And yet.......few actors project ""sincerity"" in a character any better than Gant does. In one last point about another longtime thesp, Stephen Lang comes across very admirably.......and when you're able to do that when playing against Light's extraordinary performance, you really are accomplishing something.

To say that this is not a good film, I cannot do. But I expected more.........I hoped for more. (This will not make it to my ""Addictive"" DVD shelves).

3566295,5,B001F9FHAS,"Easily one of the best gay-themed films of the last 5 years.  The film does a remarkable job of telling the story of Christianity and homosexuality and the intricate, often destructive dance between the two, but does so with subtle and thoughtful care.  Not a bad actor in the film, the film quality is exceptional, and the writing is both brilliant and well-interpreted.  It has a clean, spare, lucid feel that helps it transcend the usual shouting and finger-pointing done around the topic of ""ex-gays"" and people that purport to help gays and lesbians become straight.  This is worth seeing regardless of your belief or perspective on this topic.",1232496000,12,649,4.926605504587156

3566297,5,B001F9FHAS,"I had read a review of the movie in one of the local Atlanta gay magazines early last year, which gave it a really good review.  I had been waiting and waiting for it to be released in one of the local theatres so I could check it out, since I also really like Chad Allen and Robert Gant.  Finally, it came here a couple of months ago and I went and saw it.  I was definately not dissapointed!  You can read some of the other reviews or the plot summary up top to see what the movie is about.  I just wanted to say how wonderful the movie really is and what a terriffic job Chad and Robert (along with Judith Light and the rest of the cast) did.  It was not overly dramatic or sappy, and the acting was totally professional, not over the top or amateurish like could be the case with a lower budget movie like this.  The story itself was very well done and the pacing was just right- before I knew it, it was over.

I also read in the initial review that Allen and Gant have started thier own production company.  If this is an example of what they plan on doing, I can't wait to see the next movie.  I have enjoyed both of thier work for a while and am very glad they made the decision they did to come out.  Do yourself a favor- rent or buy this when it comes out.  It'll be worth it!",1230595200,5,1286,3.98046875
3566298,5,B001F9FHAS,"I literally just got back from seeing this movie not more than fifteen minutes ago at a local film festival; the fact that my first order of business is to write a review is a testament to how much it impressed me.  I heard it mentioned only in passing some time ago and decided to look into it, and since the showing happened to be on a day when I had little else to do, I thought, well, why not?  Good choice on my part.

I confess:  I thought that I knew what to expect from this film.  I mean, it's about a misguided gay man being sent to a Christian reformation program to cure him of his ""sexual brokenness.""  Clearly lots of horrible things were going to happen!  However, I was very much surprised for the better.  I laughed, I found myself with watery eyes, and the audience even collectively gasped at one point.  There are no ""bad"" people in this movie.  Each character is weighed fairly and fleshed out into real, believable, understandable human beings, and I sympathized with each of them in a different way.  And even though the film opens with contrasting images of a sex scene and an evangelical church congregation singing a hymn, this movie is by no means about gratuitous sex or pitching ideologies against one another with the aim of making one side look terrible.

I would have appreciated more attention being given to Mark's actual transformation inside ""Genesis House""--the transition from him as a confrontational, unstable wreck to a well-manned and well-groomed member of the group happens abruptly and largely without explanation--but the film could only contain so much, and the great attention that was given to the exploration of human interaction and relationships made up for it.

""Save Me"" has claimed a very early spot on my Wish List.  I can't wait for it to be released.",1224374400,42,1808,4.662460567823344
3566299,4,B001F9FHAS,"I would have gone 5 stars but the subject matter made me angry. Why the anger? You can't change who you are! Not with religion, not with brainwashing, not with beating....we are who we are, plain and simple, can someone deny themselves...sure, but that will be living a lie and living a very unhappy life. Chad Allen, as always terrific has hit bottom sex and drugs around the clock, family is fed up, go to Genesis House and find God and be cured. Judith Light is alternately good and scary, too. She runs the place, her husband is more human. She lost her son and is driven to save Mark (Chad) from the bad influence and advances of Scott (Robert Gant also terrific) who loves him. This is a roller coaster of emotions and no matter what side of this ""debate"" you fall on, it is a very well done and frightening movie. The rest of the cast is, although mostly in the background, are wonderful, too. This movie isn't for everyone but it is well done and worthy of a look-see.

3566303,5,B001F9FHAS,"As both an atheist and someone who thinks these conversion programs are a crock, I watched this movie with the assumption that I would not like it; however, as you can see by my rating, this movie is much more than a simple polemic from either side of these issues. With a complexity of characters and a certain amount of grace this movie ends up being about love in which all sides-those that choose to remain in a gay relationship, those that choose to stay with the program, and those that run the program-end up the better for it. I have my doubts as to how typical the Christian based conversion program shown in the movie is; however, in the end the Christians don't come off as extreme caricatures anymore than the gay men in the movie do. I highly recommend this movie.",1386288000,,777,4.440559440559441

3566305,5,B001F9FHAS,"What a terrific movie! 5 Stars! Never before have I seen this type of subject matter handled in a more balanced and even handed way. I half expected that the couple who run the Christian ""Pray away the Gay"" program would be portrayed as over-the-top, Bible-thumpers. Instead, I found the story to be top notch and the subject matter is right out of today's headlines. Judith Light's performance reminds me of Mary Tyler Moore's Oscar award winning role in Ordinary People. Ms. Light practically STEALS the movie, but this is a group effort with fine performances from an excellent cast. There isn't a bad scene or a false note in the whole film, I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1375488000,,688,4.741666666666666
3566306,5,B001F9FHAS,"This is a great movie for anyone who has come ""out"" of the Ex-Gay ministries, as I have. The movie does not make the people in these ministries seem like bad people...only the people that most really are in real life: folks wanting to do what they understand the Bible to teach. They just want to help others and be good Christians. And those gays who join these minitries also just want to be good men and good Christians. They want to do what is right. But often in the process they find that they seem to be fighting themselves in the battle--and from what I've read in Sylvia Penningtons book, ""Ex Gay's: There Are None"", the reality is that many young men have committed suicide over this inner struggle with themselves.

I've tried it both ways, and acceptance of my gay side brought me peace. But this is a movie....and the guy does not always find the guy in the end and ride off into the sunset together. (It's the same story with straight people...or they get someone less than who they deserved.) This life is rarely perfect...which is why we needed a Savior in the first place--to save us from it and from ourselves.

I highly recommend this movie. I recommend the Ex-Gay person to accept themselves as a Christian who just happens to be gay, while not abandoning their deep faith in God. At least that's been my understanding for the past 25 years of my own acceptance. Nobody in this life is perfect. Do not strive for perfection....strive for Him. To know Him is to know Love and to never truly feel alone in this life.",1366243200,2,1534,4.475

3566308,5,B001F9FHAS,"I've always been a fan of Chad Allen from his ""Donald Strachey"" mystery films, and of course Robert Gant from ""Kiss Me Deadly"" and Queer as Folk.  Here they prove again why there are easy on the eyes and of course are great actors.  Add in Tony Award winning actress Judith Light and the bar is raised and they rise to the challenge.  The story could have easily been a 2 dimensional exercise in characters dealing with their homosexuality and a couple trying to show them the ""straight path"".  But the writer, director and especially the cast make this a 2 sided affair showing both sides without making either one the villain.  Excellent performances by all and an ending that is well liked by the viewer.",1362009600,,707,4.579365079365079

3566311,5,B001F9FHAS,"I agree with every 5 star review & can't really put it any better. I think it was a frank portrayal & although I was more than satisfied with the ending, it made me sad that these programs exist. Really good job by all the leads - Chad Allen, Robert Gant & Judith Light. I hope they continue to produce more quality films like this one.",1284249600,,336,4.106060606060606
3566312,4,B001F9FHAS,"This film deals with the vicious cycle created by religion toward homosexuality, in this case, centering around gay men. The cycle of hatred and rejection which is imposed on gays in general, but mostly on gay children, by parents and society usually because of a religious influence. These children then internalize this hatred and rejection toward themselves and others who are gay, which in turn causes self-destructive attitudes. Religion creates a ""straw man"", as we see in this movie. Religion creates the problem in order to become the ""answer"" to the problem and to ""solve"" it. Religion then becomes substantial or meaningful while the reality of being gay, which is not a choice, is diminished. Religion insists there is a problem that must be solved, then exploits the minds of others to reject homosexuality, which keeps the cycle going. Believing what religion tells them, parents reject, even hate, their own children to the point of casting them out on the street. Religion then creates the answer, which is to ""love and accept"" these ""sinners"" under religions condition that they reject who they really are and to accept something that is obscure, enigmatic and even ludicrous. This causes religion to seem legitimate, important and necessary, even noble, while at the same time being the very cause of the problem. I tend to enjoy gay films that are not so serious, more romantic and funny. I would say that this is an important film, one that had to be made for our times. I would recommend it to parents or to anyone who is struggling with accepting a gay child for who they really are. If the choice comes down to choosing between your child and religion, I would choose the one you can see, hear, feel, and hold close to your heart... really.",1280102400,,1762,4.837748344370861
3566313,4,B001F9FHAS,"I remember speaking with a local and respected politician who once said to me he was ""fundamental in regards to faith"" and that there was nothing wrong with believing in his principles so strongly. I wondered whether `fundamentalism' had indeed become a dirty word, and whether this was deserved or not, as I believed much the same. I too was, and to a large extent still am, fundamental about my beliefs.

""Save Me"" tries desperately hard not to antagonise, and attempts in so far as is possible to bridge the divide between two extreme schools of thought. Ultimately one must choose a side as does the film, and in doing so cannot avoid the consequences of such a polarised subject. For me the naive sincerity of this church (and I believe they have some genuine concern and affection for gay men and women) ultimately undermines the depths of the hurt, alienation and desperation felt by many a gay man and women both spiritually and emotionally. The church just do not know, and though it believes it is the custodian of truth, it's knowledge is but a shadow.

Judith Light as the `mother' and `minister' of Genesis Ministries, attempts to relive her life and failure through the lives of young gay men she sees as broken and in need of salvation. The perverse irony is that she herself has lost her own gay son to suicide, after having thrown him out of the family home after confiding in her about being gay. For me the most debilitating and impotent tragedy of this film is that rather than acknowledge her part in his death, she continues to see his homosexuality as the cause of his death. Her words as she recounts the story to (Chad Allan) still resonate with me: ""The day I told him to leave, was the last time I saw my son"".

Ask any son who has been torn from his home, or the love of his mother (or any parent for that matter) of the impact of such an act, and a desperate story will emerge. The fact that the cause of that hurt is another person's religious conviction is for me an unacceptable denial that flies in the face of both religious principle and belief. Like many who fundamentally believe, Judith Light's character is of the opinion that if they show any form of compromise emotionally, physically or relgiously, that such would undermine their own salvation. For this reason they are stoic in belief, cold in argument, and removed from love.

Perhaps compromise is the wrong word, and instead one should use `apology'. I for one believe a great apology is due to many a gay man and women, especially those who have in their lives been subject to both a direct and indirect faith based hate, founded on the illusion of principle.

This is one of Judith Light's best portrayals, and whilst I was never a fan of her before, I am certainly one who respects her acting skills now. Ultimately this is a difficult subject matter to tackle, and the sea of emotion that results is often difficult to navigate. This is true of the story and one's own religious convictions, particularly for those that have found their own lives and stories entwined in such. For me this film addresses numerous `taboo' subjects, in that it portrays the reality that many gay men and women are spiritual and indeed broken. Furthermore, that brokenness has its root in the human failings of good men and women, whose ability to parent has been diminished, undermined and invalidated by a unbending and ill conceived religious belief. Rather than take ownership of their inheritance and failings, they divert attention away from themselves and their actions onto the internal struggles of their sons and daughters. Many of whom consider themselves to be Christian, and try in the best way they are able to follow Christ in a world that shows little sympathy for either their own internal war or their affections and loves.

The that fellow believers would participate in such a crass, naive injustice in the lives of others, is for me a `fundamental' betrayal of truth. In many instances the characters portrayed in this film (shown in a series of counselling sessions, where the audience is an unknown participant) reveal that their `silence is their self-defence,' and how the horror of loosing those they love is for them more important than finding themselves.
Chad Allan like Judith Light has a strong presence in this film, although his character at times frustrates you. Ultimately the entire subject matter frustrates, and this is why the film works for me. It's an honest attempt at dialogue, whilst it tries to reconcile the Christian right with the gay and lesbian community. There is still a long way to go, and in the interim far too many men and women suffer the indignity of such treatment, isolation and death (both emotional and at times physical).

A good film, which tackles a subject matter many dare not address. Well worth the effort and expense. The TV series ""Prayers for Bobby"" in which the same subject matter is addressed, and the 'repentance' of a mother (Sigorney Weaver)so elegantly portrayed, is another film to watch. For those that are interested, the book written by Bobby's mother on which the TV series is based, is profound and moving apology to her son.",1278460800,2,5191,4.7292817679558015
3566314,5,B001F9FHAS,"I was one of the few who not only got to see the very first showing of Save Me,in LA,But we also got to meet all the actors that starred in Save Me,with the exception of Steven Lang,he had to stay in NY. We have seen Steven Lang on sevral episodes of Law & Order and ,is a wonderful actor. The film was awesome!! It very much reminded me of when I came out. I will say it very much played with my strings. Very Dramatic,but one of the best endings ever! I would like to say thank you to Kirkland tibbles for the invite and all the pictures afterwards! I truly love Judith Light,she has always been one of my long time favorites. She really brought the flm to life and with her touch,it allowed everyone to see what is truly like to struggle between accepting that your son is Homosexual and loving him for who and what he is,or turning your back on him and leaving him alone in this big world to defend for himself,with no support what so ever. It not only left you in the end feeling extremely happy for them both,but also feeling sorry for Judith,because it made her realize what she did was not only wrong,but that there was no going back and saying I am sorry,because he was there no more! It will not only be a test to all who watch it,but it will leave you seriously thinking,could I ever treat my son or daughter this way and be able to live with my decision for the rest of my life? It was a well thought out movie,with alot of hard work from the entire cast. But also contained a message for all those heterosexual parents that may be dealing with this same situation?Afterwards it left me not only thankful that I have a loving,caring and excepting family,but wanting to help all those who are maybe just coming out and need someone to confine in or someone to just listen.

3566316,4,B001F9FHAS,"First, I have to admit, based only on the story, and Chad Allen's stellar performance, I would gladly have given ""Save Me"" Five Stars.  But this was a five star story, with some three star actors, some really horrid music, and some really quirky editing. The real problem; Judith Light has nearly ruined yet another movie with a stiff, unimaginative performance. She only has one character in her, and she gives that same old tired performance each and every time.

The real story is about a mother who has lost her Gay son to drugs, and chooses to believe that the bigger problem was his homosexuality, and that faith in God would have saved him. So she sets about to change Gay men into heterosexuals by cramming Jesus down their throats. Chad Allen's character shakes her faith, in many ways, starting with the fact that he reminds her of her dead son. Everyone sees this but her. And when he falls in love with another resident at the facility, everyone except her can see that the relationship that develops between the two men is healthy, healing, and inspirational.

A lot can be said about ex-gay ministries, and whether or not they do any good, or have the ability to change someone's sexuality. I liken the process to changing a Black man into a White man. You can make someone behave any way you want, but you can't change what they are. But that has little to do with this story. The real story here is that a woman, driven mad by her inability to save her son, is out to change other people's sons, thinking she is saving them. And in the end, we get a glimpse into her healing, brought about by the sight of two men who love each other enough to have the strength to escape this ill conceived, though well intentioned program. We are given hope that she can finally see the error of her ways, and give people the help they need, not the help she thinks they should have.

I highly recommend this movie. But don't lose sight of the real message here. Before you try and heal someone else, you have to look at your own motives. Are you sure you're fixing the right problem? Are you trying to help them heal, or are you trying to change them into what you want them to be? I think ""Save Me"" does a great job of illustrating the mistakes we can make, when we judge the lives of other people, by our own moral, societal, and personal standards.",1263340800,3,2353,4.414746543778802
3566317,4,B001F9FHAS,"Ironically, I watched this film on the same day that the American Psychological Association declared that mental health professionals should not tell gay clients they can become straight through therapy or other treatments.  I'll admit to being fired up on the subject, and expecting ""Save Me"" to be a scathing indictment of the whole gay-to-straight movement.  (I mean, the DVD box cover art makes quite the statement...)

Much to my surprise and pleasure, it isn't.  In fact, there are no real ""bad guys"" in the film...only people acting on what they feel is right and trying to do their best, no matter how misguided their feelings and motives are.

The story is this: After his wanton drug abuse spins out of control (and his refusal to stay at a county hospital), openly-gay Mark (Chad Allen) winds up at Genesis House, a retreat where men learn to ignore their gay impulses and lead a straight life by finding God and Jesus.  Although they pepper every other sentence with expressions like ""God be praised"" and ""in the name of our lord, Jesus Christ"", the husband/wife team who run the place, Gayle (Judith Light) and Ted (Stephen Lang) don't come across like cultists or fanatics.  They just truly believe that, if you follow God's teachings, you can make your life better... and better to them means straight.  They don't intend to ""cure"" anyone; they just feel that gay/straight is a choice and, with enough will, you can be happy on the ""proper"" side of the fence if you just work hard at it and love God enough.

Also at the house is Scott (Robert Gant), who is desperately trying to become a straight man to gain the love and respect of his dying father.  As Mark dries out, he and Scott form a very natural bond which leads to stronger feelings.  This is much to the dismay of Gayle, who does her best to intervene.  But is her motivation to do so really in the best interests of the two men, or for something more selfish?

Okay, most of the ultra-religious out there are going to hate this movie because it dares to even suggest that love is God and that it trumps all.  Me, I thought for a film that could be accused of having a bit of an agenda, it did a beautiful job of representing both sides of the issue.  The fact of the matter is that Mark becomes a far better person after his time at Genesis House.  He believes it's because he's found Christ, but it's really because he's found love... not only romantic love with Scott, but also a strong, caring, parental love from Gayle and Ted.

Strong acting rules this film.  Gant and Light anchor the film with fiery, intense, conflicted performances.  Stephen Lang offers up depth and thoughfulness in what could have been a throwaway role.  I also really liked Robert Baker as Lester, Mark's roommate at Genesis... he's superb as the self-loathing big guy who sets many of the wheels of the story into motion.

In the end, I deduct a star for the tinny soundtrack and for the fact that Mark's recovery from his addictions is somewhat glossed over.  Other than that, this is a powerful yet gentle film with a tremendous message.  And that message is conveyed with a fairness and consideration usually not found in this genre.",1249603200,2,3193,4.602473498233215

3566319,5,B001F9FHAS,"SAVE ME is a wonderfully nuanced film that does not take the easy way out in dealing with its complex and touchy subject matter.  Instead, it presents fully realized characters on both sides of the argument of so-called Christian-inspired reformation of gays.  This is an insightful and deeply moving film that stirs the soul through its realistic depiction of decent, but flawed human beings in search of spiritual redemption.  What it reveals more than anything else, is that we are all vulnerable and needy, all capable of love for those we may otherwise view as our enemy, and all more than capable of finding our own path to self-discovery and acceptance.  Judith Light gave an Oscar-worthy performance - she was the highlight of the great, great film!  Please see this important work of art.  I'll bet that regardless of your sexuality or your view of homosexuality, you'll see a little bit of yourself in one or more of the characters.",1245628800,,942,4.85625

some people think that if we do this and that that we will be cured of our orientation....after struggling for over 35 years trying to cure myself, asking God to cure me, I finally accepted myself because I knew that God accepted me just as I am.....Sure there are exceptions to the rule, there is people just like Chad Allen's character before he went to the ranch because they believe what some preacher or fundamentalists says about what God is thinking.....the funny thing in life is that some of those same preachers and fundamentalists are struggling with their own homosexuality and they are placing all their shame on others....this movie was really just like life is out here in the real world....I loved the end....they rode off into the sunset.....a fairy tale ending (pardon the pun)",1245628800,,869,4.878378378378378

I especially liked Judith Light's character, who was very adamant about her anti-gay beliefs, but was still portrayed as a simpathetic character.

3566325,5,B001F9FHAS,"One of the best films to address homosexuality and also the conversion camps out there. This movie does start out with a sex scene, but is important to the storyline. For instance, this scene shows us how Mark (Chad Allen) is living his life (sex and drugs), and shows what happens to him to force him into a Christian conversion camp.

Gayle (Judith Light) is a woman with a mission. Her mission is to try to save as many ""broken"" people she can by ""curing"" them of their homosexuality. Judith Light's performance is nothing short of spectacular for she truly portrays a woman that believes in what she is doing.

Scott (Robert Gant) is a man that has been in Genesis House and is trying to overcome his sexuality for his dying father. However, when Mark (Chad Allen) enters the house they soon find a connection--friendly at first.

I will not spoil any other part of the film. However, I will say this is one of the best ""gay"" films ever made! Chad Allen, Robert Gant, and Judith Light are all fantastic in their roles. Very rarely do we see acting this good, and a storyline so complete. Truly a remarkable film and an astonishing cast--including those I've not mentioned!",1237161600,,1176,4.59047619047619
3566326,5,B001F9FHAS,"Save Me was the best film I have seen thus far dealing with ex-gay ministries.  Having spent five years in therapy to `become straight' as well as working with two different ex-gay therapy groups, the movie spoke to me on a very personal level.  My next step was to go to a place like Genesis house.  It was a step I never took, and am so thankful that God allowed me to skip that particular event and instead let me begin my journey to who I am today:  a healthy gay man, who loves who he is, loves his long-term, monogamous boyfriend, and is very happy with his life.  Save Me, I felt, was a very realistic portrayal of those in the ex-gay ministries, both as clients and as founders/leaders of the programs.  The gay men were believable and their stories valid and relatable.  However, the true star of the show was Judith Light's character, the woman leading Genesis House.  What I appreciated the most was how the film truly respected both sides of this issue and the people involved in it.  From my experience, and I know there are others that had much worse than I, the leaders of the ex-gay ministries were not evil or filled with hate.  They were so very much the opposite, people who genuinely loved the gay men and women they worked with, continuously giving of themselves in order to show us love, who's only genuine desire was to help us go to Heaven and live in God's love.  And, like all of us, they were broken as well.  Save Me did a beautiful job showing the love and the pain on all sides.  As I sat watching the film, at times I was paralyzed by the memories that came back to me from my experience, as well as by thankfulness that God allowed me to avoid certain steps that I nearly took, and let me simply find His love and His acceptance as a gay man, instead of staying in such a state of eternal torment and struggle.",1237161600,23,1842,4.304347826086956
3566327,5,B001F9FHAS,"Save Me is quite an unexpected film. We are shown a Christian camp for young gay men who are there to ""cure"" themselves of their sexuality and their drug addictions, a place that is quietly judgemental but just happens to end up teaching some of them the life lessons they really need to learn.  Judith Light is remarkable as a Christian woman whose life's mission comes from a tragic incident in her past, and Chad Allen and Robert Gant are great as the two camp members who become attracted to each other.  The supporting cast is excellent, too.  A must see.",1235952000,,560,4.524752475247524
