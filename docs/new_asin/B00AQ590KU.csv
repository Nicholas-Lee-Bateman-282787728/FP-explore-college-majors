5468060,5,B00AQ590KU,i used to remember these tv shows when i was a kid they were on tv on the boomer rang channel it was a good cartoon network series only if they had the centurions then all my tv shows would come true get this dvd brings back memories,1363219200,,233,3.875
5468061,5,B00AQ590KU,"I'm a big cartoon fan of anything from the 1980s and I was more than excited when I signed up to review Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors Volume 2 courtesy in exchange for my honest review. The series aired in 1985 for one season consisting of only sixty-five episodes (the standard life-time of an average kid's show). It was based on the line of Mattel toys.

The series used the 'good vs. evil' plot. Jayce's father, Audric a botanist, created a miracle crop that could grow in any environment, but things go horribly wrong when a solar flare sends a burst of radiation causing his plants to mutate. The first plant is known as Saw Boss and the others are his Monster Minds. The plants are evil creatures who can transform into vehicles. Only a magic root can stop them. Audric has half of the root and his son, Jayce has the other half. Every episode has Jayce, along with the wizard Gillian, the telepathic Flora, the squire Oon and the pilot Herc Stormsailor (a rip-off of Han Solo from Star Wars), traveling to planet to planet searching for his father, but of course Saw Boss sends his Monster Minds after them.

The thirty-three episodes on volume 2 are:

Disc 1 - 33. Lightning Strikes Twice / 34. The Liberty Stone (Part 1) / 35. The Vines (The Liberty Stone, Part II) / 36. The Spacefighters (The Liberty Stone, Part III) / 37 Heart of Paxtar (The Liberty Stone, Part IV) / 38. Appointment At Forever (The Liberty Stone, Part V) / 39. What's Going On? / 40. DarkSinger / 41. Swamp Witch / 42. Deadly Reflections / 43. Early Warnings

Disc 2 - 44. A Question of Conscience / 45. Life Ship / 46. The Mirage Makers / 47. Do Not Disturb / 48. Dream World / 49. The Children of Solarus II / 50. The Gardner / 51. Armada / 52. The Chimes of Sharpis / 53. Galaxy Gamester / 54. Circus Planet

Disc 3 - 55. Common Bond / 56. Mistress of Soul Tree/ 57. The Life Eater / 58. Wasteland / 59. The Oracle / 60. Short Circuit, Long Wait / 61. Time and Time Again / 62. The Source / 63. The Raid / 64. The Squire Smith  / 65. Final Ride at Journey's End

I was only four when the series aired on television, I do remember seeing the toys being advertised and I recall the catchy theme song. Last year, I won ten DVDS off of a blog giveaway, in which one of them was volume one. Yes, the series was intended to help sell the toys, but there were several great science-fiction writers, including J. Michael Straczynski, that crafted some intriguing episodes. Sadly, there were only sixty-five episodes made and there was no official ending. The series leaves Jayce and his Lightning League still searching for his father. I think it wonderful that Mill Creek Entertainment is bringing some of the short-lived cartoons from my childhood onto DVD at long last. The only thing I didn't care about volume two was the dopey cover. Overall, I had a nolgastic blast watching Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors.",1362528000,5,2891,4.402621722846442
5468062,5,B00AQ590KU,I have had volume 1 for several years and I am glad to have the rest of the series.  This is a fun trip down memory lane.,1362355200,,121,3.4814814814814814
5468063,4,B00AQ590KU,"However, the second season/set of Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors cartoons are finally here and that should be cause for celebration!  The cartoons on this set look fantastic, and the price is quite reasonable (especially compared to the cheaply remastered/produced Warner/Hanna Barbara archive animated tv shows that are WAY overpriced for the home made discs and the cheap menus--if there even are any--so lame).  I do applaud Mill Creek Entertainment for their efforts, which are at times clumsy (as they do stumble on the remastering front from time to time) but well meant.  They really do care about the fans of these shows, and for this value of a price they deliver a consistent deal on their cartoons and tv show DVD sets.  This one comes packaged in a regular plastic DVD case with THREE PAPER SLEEVES INSIDE TO STORE THE THREE INDIVIDUAL DISCS... ughhh.  Two of our discs were slightly scuffed just opening and removing the discs for the 1st time!  Too bad.  Otherwise, it's quite wonderful to have this classic tv show's final episodes on DVD, and they look quite crisp and sound fantastic.  I am very happy with this DVD set for the price and content.  The menus have a nice image of Jayce on the screen that rocks the theme song while perusing the very limited options there.  Not bad.  Keep it up Mill Creek, and you'll have a customer for life.",1361836800,2,1359,4.716101694915254
5468064,5,B00AQ590KU,"I am going to commit what a bunch of people are going to whine at me as being the cardinal sin of revewing before receiving here. I cannot help myself. The fifteen or twenty people who had the privilege of ever hearing of ""Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors"" in their youths have been waiting for a COMPLETE release of the series ever since ""Shout Factory!"" teased us with the first thirty-three episodes before dropping the project several years ago now. Then, just when it looks like Mill Creek is about to do the same thing to fans...HERE is the final half of the series, due out in mid-February! I said it before in reference to Mill Creek's rerelease and COMPLETION of ""C.O.P.S.;"" Mill Creek truly does care about their fans!",1356566400,21,726,4.592307692307692

5468086,5,B00AQ590KU,thank you,1404691200,,9,4.0
5468087,5,B00AQ590KU,I remember these from when I was a child.  They make not have all the new fangled computer upgrades but they are still great cartoons.,1404086400,,134,4.36
5468088,5,B00AQ590KU,"I found the dvd to have excellent picture and sound quality. There was no skipping, no scratches on the disc, and no missing discs. A great buy!!!",1403395200,,146,4.444444444444445
5468089,3,B00AQ590KU,"I love JATWW, this series are original and creative, I recommend  even for new generations.
The only matter about this set is the quality of the package.",1402444800,,153,4.666666666666667
5468090,5,B00AQ590KU,This is the final volume of the 80's classic cartoon with the conclusion of the series will the Lightning League win over the Monster Minds.,1395705600,,140,4.64
5468091,3,B00AQ590KU,"It was alright. The kids thought it was so-so. Good value for the price. Not, the bedt, not the worst.",1393804800,,102,4.15
5468092,4,B00AQ590KU,"This DVD release gets 4 stars on the merits of the episodes themselves.  More on that in a bit.  This 80's series had some great writers on it like Larry DiTillio and J. Michael Straczynski, who worked on excellent shows such as Babylon 5, Captain Power, He-Man, She-Ra, Real Ghostbusters, and Beast Wars.

Now as to why this DVD release doesn't get 5 stars.  That's the production values of this release.  Shame on you, Cookie Jar!

A standard dual layered DVD release of a half hour series contains about 8 episodes per disc.  This release contains 11 episodes per each of 3 discs.  That means they had to employ compression to fit the episodes on each disc.  Therefore, the video quality would be reduced.  This should have been a 4 disc release with 1 disc containing 9 episodes to make the 33 episode count.

Then there's how the discs are shipped.  Cookie Jar created a special kind of case.  There's space for only ONE disc!  There's a larger than usual center peg that holds all 3 discs stacked on top of each other!  That's just asking for scratches to form on the bottom of the discs, increasing the potential for damage.  And speaking of damage, my DVD case was totally unacceptable!  The front had a sizable section from the bottom right broken off, floating around inside the case.  Then there's the aforementioned larger peg.  It was half destroyed!  The peg is not solid, with plenty of interior empty space to save on plastic and thus on costs.

If you do get this set, be SURE to check your discs and make sure they're all playable.

EDIT: I blamed Cookie Jar in my review for the low quality control of this release.  The blame actually should fall on Mill Creek Entertainment.  They made this release.  Cookie Jar just supplied the material for DVD authoring.  Apparently, Mill Creek does all of their releases on the cheap.  They use high compression on the video to fit more episodes on a disc.  For instance, their Cosby Show releases.  The first releases were spread over 4 discs a season.  Mill Creek's are 2 disc a season.  So, the video quality is theoretically reduced by half.",1392768000,,2104,4.605405405405405
5468093,5,B00AQ590KU,This cartoon is one of the things I remember the most from my childhood. It's great that someone gives us access to this kind of series and also by a very affordable price.,1391904000,,172,4.242424242424242
5468094,5,B00AQ590KU,"Just like I said, I'm happy to have this favorite cartoon series from my childhood in my DVD collection. You can't go wrong with a good company like Cookie Jar  having the heart to bring out good oldies for people that love their animated shows from the heyday.",1391731200,,261,4.4375
5468095,5,B00AQ590KU,Good stuff from the 80's.....if u like 80s cartoons this a good one that did not receive its just cause .........long live jayce and the wheeled warriors,1387670400,,153,4.703703703703703
5468096,5,B00AQ590KU,"Who doesn't love 80's cartoons? I'm glad volume 2 finally came out. I remember watching the cartoon as a kid and always wondered what happened. Guess I'll still never know (there is no ""final episode"" because a movie that never happened was supposed to wrap the story line up).",1385683200,,277,4.673469387755102
5468097,4,B00AQ590KU,i do recommend this to anyone that loves 80s cartoons or fans of sci fi/silly cartoons shows then or now!,1377129600,,105,4.3
5468098,4,B00AQ590KU,"It's great that Mill Creek picked up the slack and gave Jayce fans closure with the second half of the series. As silly as the ""blushing"" box looks (what is with those rosy cheeks? :p ), it's three discs of nostalgia. And for a show nearly hitting thirty years old, it's actually aged decently, better then some shows from that era. The only snag with this set is, that some episodes do show signs of pixelation, partly in due to their compressing process. But, it doesn't hamper much, it's just noticeable in a few episodes. The only other complaint is the casing itself. The discs are each placed in envelopes that are saddled by the papers edges. Not ideal for transit (sellers take note), I have a few superficial scratches on the third disc due to the fact. But seems to be playing fine. With that said, it's your only way for the time being, to finally enjoy the rest of the series. And the price is right. Definitely satisfied.",1376956800,,934,4.5
5468099,5,B00AQ590KU,just what I wanted I would  recommend this to others it makes great gifts to others and friends very nice,1373760000,,105,4.25
5468100,4,B00AQ590KU,This is one of those old school cartoons that I could never forget about. Memory stays with you forever. Cool show.,1373587200,,115,4.523809523809524
5468101,4,B00AQ590KU,Although I'm a child of the 80 's I don't remember this show but I bought it because it was included in a bonus vid I bought. Very good cartoon a keeper for sure. There are two vol. I ended up purchasing both!,1373500800,,209,3.883720930232558
5468102,4,B00AQ590KU,I am happy to see this product is finally available on DVD. The show is great. Jayce completes his mission in this second half. The showdown of the lightening league. Fun Humor and animation. Classic 80's cartoon style. The only negative thing I could say about this release of it (the only release) is that the digital compression seems to be a little much. If you are critical like me and notice details then you may see what should be solid lines in the animation turn into broken and jagged lines up-close. The average person might not notice this so if you are not an A/V person or Critic then you may think I am being too anal about it. Overall buy it I say.,1371600000,,664,4.32
5468103,5,B00AQ590KU,love the series and am so happy that the second half of it was finally put out.  haven't had time to watch it yet though,1370908800,,120,3.8
5468104,5,B00AQ590KU,I feel like I'm 6 and it's saturday morning again. I love that I can buy almost all of my old faves on dvd,1370736000,,106,3.4583333333333335
5468115,5,B00AQ590KU,"As i mentioned earlier in the previous review i watche dthe series when i was younger, i even knew someone who i often called jayce, though his name was jason. this is a great conclusion of the series, though this does not have have extras to it, as they are on volume one, but at least you can watch the entire series over. The fan base for the series is massive and seveal people have made their own versions, even tec savvy people had even made lego versions and 3D shorts videos of the main vehicles. Overall the quality and quanity of the episodes is fine and picture great, if you are a fan of the series then this is a great dvd to get. threre is a french version which has great dvd box art and cover art, with some extras, unless you speak the lingo, hard to understand as there changes to the battle cry. the french version has light force, to the lightning league, and light  force attack to lightning strikes.  a great series to have and own.",1370476800,,954,4.265193370165746
5468116,5,B00AQ590KU,"To say they just don't make action cartoons like they use to, is a understatement. There are some good ones out there, but this is a classic series.",1369612800,,148,4.321428571428571

5468118,5,B00AQ590KU,I remember watching these shows on tv years and years ago. My daughter is now hooked on anime and wanted to see these so I bought them for her. She really enjoyed this volume.,1367712000,,175,4.176470588235294

5468120,5,B00AQ590KU,I now own the entire collection of Wheeled Warriors - thank you for making this possible. Now I can relive my youthful days of watching those corny 80's cartoons all over again with a big smile on my face :D,1365638400,,207,4.2
5468121,5,B00AQ590KU,"It took a while, but to finally have the volume 2 of Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors is fantastic!  One of my favorite cartoons of the 80s, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors had good animation, good story writing, sweet music, and unforgettable characters!  I was surprised at the packaging of the DVDs and that there were no extras, but its really over shadowed by the enjoyment of watching the rest of this unforgettable amazing series.  For anyone who loved this series, now you can get all of them in volume 1 and 2.  Thank you so much Mill Creek Entertainment!",1364083200,,561,4.58
5468122,5,B00AQ590KU,"I am a huge Wheelies Fan. I have the entire toy collection with multiples on most pieces and while I have to explain what the show was to even 80s kids, I never missed a episode after school.
When Shout Factory put out Volume 1 I was estatic, forget GIJoe, Transformers, & Voltron I wanted this, I rushed right out for it and was crushed when they cancelled Volume 2
Then I heard that the rights got sold off again & a second volume was promised but my hopes weren't up. After all if the sales didn't show they probably wouldnt go ahead same as Shout Factory and since me & the other handful of fans already had V1, well I tend not to buy movies I already have over again...

When I saw V2 was up for grabs though I pounced on it!

When the set showed up I thought I got a bootleg (Silver Surfer Cartoon anyone). The inlay card and packaging looked like something done in photoshop and I was nervious.

Then I put in disc one, no extras, no animated menues, no nothing but the episode picture and sound quality where perfect!

Thats when it struck me the good people at Cookie Jar just wanted to share some Wheelie Love! For the unbeatable price if you can forgo the bells and whistles you can not do better then this.

While from 2 manufactures I am more than pleased to have a full episode collection. Now if I could only get those $6000 Zoggies that show up on ebay from time to time...",1363651200,,1389,4.206766917293233

5468124,5,B00AQ590KU,"I wanted to write about why this show is relevant when so many people probably never saw or heard of it. I offer this instead of repeating facts from Wikipedia-like resources. You have a group of heroes that have a lot in common with Star Wars. A brave young guy with Daddy issues. A snarky pilot. A wizard with the voice of reason. A cute, clumsy sidekick. Flora is a ""princess"" of sorts. Most of the action sequences take place in a Tattooine looking desert planet. You have bad guys that resemble HR Giger creations (Alien). It sounds very unoriginal: why would you still be interested? The concept is strong. Organic enemies and automotive hijinks. If you wreck a car you can simply grow a new one. What if your enemy was your own creation? Plants you designed also resembled VEHICLES you designed? Also, Jayce had impressive grit. The kid never gave up. I recall the day I actually asked for help in Best Buy to find out what happened to volume 2 and didn't get an answer. Several years later - I don't care if the packaging is a shade better than a bootleg, I wanted to have all the episodes as promised and for this price how could you be disappointed? I love the synth music even though it's dated. I loved this show despite the flaws I've mentioned. When Star Wars finally was released on VHS or aired on cable, it's no wonder some tried to capitalize by imitating it.",1363305600,,1377,4.446640316205533
8556012,4,B00AQ590KU,"Mill Creek put out two volumes of Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and if you already have Shout Factory's volume one, then you only get an overlap of one episode if you pick up Mill Creek's volume two. Having two copies of ""Lightning Strikes Twice"" is not a deal-breaker. Volume 2 sees an improvement in both animation and storytelling, for the most part. The writers explored with serialized storytelling, at least as much as they could with a toy-based cartoon from this era. The first five episodes on the volume show the Lightning League going toe to toe with a sorcerer who challenges them for the right to wield the Liberty Stone. Then there are short arcs showing Audric's old professional enemies coming out of the woodwork to help themselves by helping Saw Boss, and some episodes showing how nerve rattling it would be to travel around trying to fight evil with essentially two precocious children underfoot (Flora and Oon). You also get plenty of Saw Boss undermining himself by hiring competent villains to deal with that troublesome boy, and then immediately sending his troopers to interfere with the guest villain's plans (and messing up the plans) which is a continuation of his characterization from part one. These episodes do mostly abandon the original A plot/B plot from volume one, in which A plot was 'Jayce gets a lead on his father, Saw Boss finds out about and lays a honey trap' and B plot was 'Herc chases treasure, finds out the real treasure was his crew the whole time.' In its place you get A plots of 'Jayce finds out Saw Boss is going to take over a planet, races ahead to warn the people who don't believe him' and B plots of 'Jayce gets separated from the group, the rest of the team pulls off a Hail Mary' but it's used more fluidly than the previous formula. Jayce's magic ring was something the writers never quite got a firm handle on, but volume two does explain a bit of its capriciousness in that the wielder's intentions must be true, and the magic works itself out according to what's available in the moment and will do the most good. It helps explain somewhat why Jayce isn't using it every single episode. What does get used more often in volume two is the vehicles. Someone must have committed to trying to sell some toys, because you get a whole lot more vehicle battles using the stack and attack pieces that were on the toys - and it works amazingly well at upping the action ante for this show. The animation styles are more consistent than in volume one. You can still tell the show was being bidded out to different studios, sometimes in the same episode, but it's less distracting for the most part. This series is well worth a look if you enjoy space opera. Don't expect Evangelion level plotting out of it, just a fun 25 minute reverie.",1507939200,,2794,4.59
8556013,5,B00AQ590KU,"The Year 1985 was around, and I was a kid. I didn't get to watch much television, but when I did, I found this show. It was pretty awesome for its time! I was talking to someone I knew about old cartoon tv shows that we wanted to watch again. Incidentally, this came up. After searching, I found it online. I ordered it and it arrived quickly. It is as I remembered and I felt like a little kid sitting there starring at the tv. My children are 4 and 6 yrs old and also loved the tv show too. It's a great buy if someone wants a collection of 1980s cartoon tv shows. I now have part 1 as well. I am a happy little boy once again.",1453593600,,629,3.883720930232558

I CAN'T FIND IT!

There are only a few bad things, but they don't concern the show it's self. One, the show can look a bit washed out at times. Two, the discs come stacked on top of each other. This is even worse than what Mill Creek did previously, with the discs in paper sleeves. If you get sets like this, I would happily recommend getting dvd cases with trays that hold the discs normally. 14mm are the size of case you need in order to fit the artwork properly.",1432857600,,587,3.983050847457627
