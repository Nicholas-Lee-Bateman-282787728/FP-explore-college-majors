8183197,1,B000O75GE4,"For years I heard about the Carry On movies.  Then about 1984 I had the opportunity to see one, Carry On Nurse.

I didn't laugh once.  I've loved every one of the 1950's black & white Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Wilfred Hyde-White, etc., movies that I have seen, so I don't think the problem is that I don't get British humor.

Amazon UK now has the (Region 2) DVD collection of all 30 Carry On movies for only 30.00 pounds.  That's a great price if you enjoy the Carry On movies.",1427587200,,481,4.3
8183198,3,B000O75GE4,"I remembered this movie as funnier than it turned out to be.
I would give it mild praise, but would not necessarily recommend it to others.",1391558400,,139,4.384615384615385
8183199,1,B000O75GE4,"Bought this for my husband who remembered it from years ago.  Apparently it was funnier then,  much, much funnier.  Too slow, too dated, a big yawn.",1388275200,,148,4.615384615384615
