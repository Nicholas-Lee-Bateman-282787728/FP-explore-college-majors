6822179,3,B00PV09C3U,"Solid B Sci-Fi action movie. A lot of stuff doesn't make sense as far as character development and skill acquisition, but otherwise there isn't anything inherently bad about it...

Except Weston. He's basically your average beta-male Millennial... in space... on steroids. He has bigger muscles than the Gladiator wannabe, but couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag. And he whines. A lot. The 8 year old girl acts like more of a man than he does. It could honestly be a 4-star movie without his disgraceful character concept.",1524096000,,528,4.866666666666666

6822186,5,B00PV09C3U,"I was very surprised that an Indy film would be so good.  It was well acted and the story held your attention.  The female lead did a great job.  There were weak moments, but all in all, very enjoyable.  It gives one hope that the Indy genre is beginning to provide good entertainment. Kevin Sorbo did a great job in bringing his talent to the movie.  If you enjoy a action sci-fi movie, that ends well, I recommend it for you.",1518998400,,427,4.222222222222222

6822198,2,B00PV09C3U,"I think college students could have made this for a film project. Pretty much half the movie is just people running across awkward terrain, and the rest is shallow dialogue. It's like the writers had a great thought, and then couldn't get it across in the script. They decided to throw in the lead character from Andromeda, which probably hurt them more than helped them. There's very little CGI, and absolutely appalling physics that make no sense. I watched about half an hour, scrolled through the rest of it, saw it was all pretty much the same, and then stopped watching.",1515542400,,576,4.712871287128713

6822200,3,B00PV09C3U,"The Title character Danielle Chuchran is awesome,
I know she does her own stunts, which was taken to a new level in the movie.

Although they did kind of draw the story out abit, by only showing her Running,
Rock climbing, and Riding a horse for long periods of time.

It was nice to see Kevin Sorbo in another (Kickstarter) movie, although wish he played more of a part.

Over all it wasn't a bad movie, good to watch, just not one to run out, and purchase.",1515196800,,458,4.241379310344827

6822204,4,B00PV09C3U,I don't know why I put off watching this movie. I love sci fi and I enjoyed this. It had good acting and decent dialogue. The action scenes were fair to good and the scenery was beautiful. To enjoy a sci fi I usually settle for 1 or 2 of my criteria being met but this met it all. The special effects weren't great but there wasn't a lot of that in the movie anyway and I have grown to not expect much in that arena for a non big budget blockbuster. Definitely worth watching.,1511913600,,476,4.021052631578947
6822205,5,B00PV09C3U,This was a surprisingly good scifi story.  The acting was good in my opinion.  I can't understand all of the negative reviews.  I've been watching and reading scifi for over 60 years and I know the difference between good and bad scifi.,1511222400,,236,4.571428571428571

6822214,5,B00PV09C3U,"A good Sci Fi movie about a space ship traveling for more than 40 years in space to try to find a habitable planet. Finally, a beacon is picked up, coming from a worm hole. A scout ship of several of the youngest and best go to investigate, but their scout ship breaks up on entry into the foreign atmosphere. The Captain is injured, and Kate Mitra single-handedly fights off aggressive humanoids as well as ugly bipedal monsters to save her Captain. The ending is uplifting, and the movie is well-worth seeing. Five stars.",1506902400,,523,4.574468085106383
6822215,1,B00PV09C3U,"This was painful to watch. The line were cheesy, there were way to many extended traveling sceens, and the action scenes were only mediocre at best.

I saw a review saying that this was better than SciFi channel movies. That may be true, but it doesn't say much when the bar is set so low.

Don't waste your time.",1506556800,,313,4.288135593220339

I personally loved this movie and everything about it.  Definitely loved the guys doing parcour throughout the terrain, that takes serious skill.

6822221,3,B00PV09C3U,"Fast-paced, low-budget, clean, sci-fi-channel-level adventure with good acting from the young female lead and Kevin Sorbo. I enjoyed the movie when the young female lead was on the move. But so much of the time the physical confrontations came about in unrealistic ways. Rather than hide, then strike, or hide and avoid, the girl would confront every group of potential adversaries, even when some of them were armed, or she was outnumbered in a major way. These low-budget sci-fi and horror movies repeat the same ridiculous contrivances to get confrontations started or body counts increased. It amazes me that the writers of these low-budget films can't be more creative. This movie was quite clean, however, which was refreshing: no profanity, vulgarity, nudity, sex, or gratuitous violence.",1503532800,,795,5.317460317460317

Yes you can nit-pic and fine something 'wrong' like one of the reviewer said ""she had to learn to get on the horse and then looked like a pro riding it""...  this was a big negative to him/her Well lets say it took her and hour to get on the horse then it took her a few more hrs to learn to ride it. (my wife had horses to rent and did tours also)(this is a movie 'not real'... This is a hard sci-fi flick and with a very plausible plot. This is a low budget movie sure, there's no denying that. Put simply it ""it's entertaining""  can you ask for more? And if there is a negative for me it's ""all that Mad Max get-up... IF YOU'RE A SCI FI FAN WATCH IT.

The acting is poor, the villains are too predictable, and as is typical, they are ugly and make terrible breathing noises and drool a lot!  The heroin climbs sheer cliffs, but has never seen a real cliff before this crash landing.  She figures out how to ride a horse, and knew what to do with the bridal, but has never seen a horse before (possibly she has seen and done these things in VR on her ship, but really, her abilities are just to conveniently good).

The creatures are good, not to bad. The best reason to watch the movie is the action, not so much the story. It's filmed primarily outside (looks a little like the original Planet of the Apes location) so the overall image and lighting is great.

There is a lot of great landscape in the movie, If i'm not mistaken they appear to have filmed this in or around Utah which has lots of parks you can go visit if you want to see more of the same.

The movie gets unbelievable at some times, at some point she finds a horse - based on the beginning of the movie you know she has never ridden a horse, yet somehow she . To make matters worse after she rides it for a bit she finds a bridle and just so happens to know what it is and how to put it on the horse.

However what could have been a great movie based on the concept became an ode to free rock climbing in the beginning and a example of poorly written dialog.

I did notice one critique about the girl smiling/laughing when she couldn't get on the horse right away - it was her first encounter with that animal beyond videos and I think she was more enjoying learning how to deal with the animal in that moment than anything. If you can't learn to have humor in a bad situation and enjoy the brief moments where you learn and aren't in imminent danger, you will break - she showed humor in her failures and that she wouldn't be the one to break. Once she got it down and got on the horse, she became more serious and buckled down to do the task and travel as needed to get to the other character.

There was one well known actor in the movie, but he was more of a bit part than anything - the girl in the movie was the main character and did very well in the role she was given.

The story was predictable however that is the case with a lot of movies.",1494115200,,1095,4.107476635514018

It's unfortunate that the writers, director, producers weren't willing/able to put in the extra effort to polish the storyline to keep the viewer fully engaged.  Suspending your disbelief is one thing, but within the narrative, things should track.  One example that shouldn't spoil anything:  it takes the protagonist several tries to mount a horse for the first time, but once she's on she's suddenly fully competent in keeping her seat and handling the reins.  That kind of inconsistency just pops me right out of the story to a eye-rolling ""yeah, right!""

I suppose since it is a so called ""B"" movie and the average star rating wasn't all that great it had me going in with my standards proportionately lowered.  Much of what other critical reviewers say is true; cheesy special effects, almost comically marginal costumes, etc.  Nonetheless I found it to be a pretty decent premise as Sci-Fi goes, and certainly entertaining.  Think of a play that is very moving.  The effects are almost by definition bad, but if it's a good story you enjoy it anyway.  That's how I felt after watching Survivor.  Somewhat paradoxically I found Danielle Chuchran as a stereotypical ""slender beauty playing a hardened combat veteran"" one of the more convincing portrayals of such a role.  I found myself believing it plausible that she could do all the things she is portrayed doing.  And, yeah, she is hot as hell, so there is that.

Spoilers Noted Below.
Part of me was wondering how they were able to take the many people dying so lightly at times but I guess that is something that they were just planning for with all of their training. The same training that led a 21 year old girl to be able to go about 11 Kilometers (roughly 6.8 miles), fight off others, find a horse, learn to ride it and then get another 15km to a wrecked ship. Though it does make me wonder why they wouldn't have more advanced battle/medical gear on hand for each person if they're able to have advanced tech in their arms that can communicate, examine plants, and map their movements and locations.

6822390,2,B00PV09C3U,"If you approach this like it were a made-for-tv saturday morning movie for kids, then this is ok...PG-13 for some blood.  Cinematography and music are better than a saturday morning movie but don't look for logic in story elements...Very little spacey special effects, the monster costumes are about what you would see in the 1970s.  Acting was surprisingly good.  The actresses are invariably gorgeous and strong with a little gay/bi implication (hand holding with the main star between a husband and his wife, and the husband calls her first thing in the AM to see her when she wakes while he is in bed with his wife, and the star sits between the husband and wife holding hands with both of them on their big space flight)...Male characters are generally helpless.  Kevin Sorbo's character is ok although his screen time is about 15 minutes, and he gets a broken leg and punctured lung so he doesn't do much.  The director, writer, producers are all mormons (and men), while the star is a woman (and a mormon).  The story includes some LDS references (like implying a save-humanity spaceship ratio of one man + multiple hot chicks), but this is outweighed by the reversal of male/female roles and general lack of originality.  The movie rips off Planet of the Apes, the Time Machine (1960), Mad Max, 2001 Space Odyssey (the bone), BSG (1979 version) and some old Star Trek episodes.  If you have a 9 or 10 year old daughter and want her to see a strong actress protagonist, then you might consider letting her watch this but check out the blood early and near the end.  Violence isn't much compared to zombies.  As for the sexuality, (a) it's only implied, (b) barely noticeable, (c) very brief and (d) all the women sport different hair colors, i.e., not all blonde.",1483315200,2,1770,4.717532467532467

She was one of the worst actresses EVER!!!  Her brother was annoying and deserved to die as well.  His character reminded me of Guy from Galaxy Quest only dumber!!!  The main character, Cait or Kate? She did an awful lot of running and mountain climbing that her body type says was completely impossible.  That being said the monsters were great!  Fight scenes were pretty good.  Go in expecting sort of stupid and you will be pleasantly surprised it didn't suck that bad.  I actually like movies like this. You know going in they are not top quality. You have to be willing to forgive a few cheap actors and enjoy the parts they did pay top dollar for.  Sit back, enjoy the impossible parts and make fun of them and watch the show.

Danielle looks realllly good doing all the action stuff so either the director knew what he was doing or Danielle really is an archer, fighter, climber, runner, equestrian, etc. As for Captaint Hunt(er), I can't help but think that when he is fighting the bad guys, he can't help but think to himself ""you guys wouldn't stand a chance against Rommie, and where the heck is my force lance when I need it?!""

The plot was something along the line of star wars meets hunger games meets Jurassic park which was surprisingly interesting. A strong female lead was a great part throughout the film. Fight scenes weren't the most dramatic and it isn't the most emotional or adrenaline filled film by a long shot. Overall it was a nice spin on the end of the world scenario.

Props appear and disappear like political promises. The script and directing is stilted, and the ""effects"" are so 1990s.

Given all that, the actors are pretty good, considering what they had to work with.

I would love to know the back-story on this movie. Was it supposed to a pilot? Do some aspiring but unprepared director stumble across a bag of cash and decide to make a movie?

This one made it to my will watch again in the future some time, which says a lot considering... and you should watch it too. Other than a bit of violence which is all plot required, realistic, and non-gratuitous, there is nothing inappropriate for children which is rather appreciable in this day and age where the plot's purpose for existing is to justify some nudity or sexual something over and over again.

6823149,2,B00PV09C3U,"Acting wasn't too bad but the special effects were over the top cheesy. Kevin Sorbo was solid but the story didn't focus on his character like I thought it was due to the credits. Storyline lacked important details. The info that we did get was covered too quickly in one line.

The makers of this movie put a lot of effort into the action scenes which were enjoyable. The fights had a realistic element to them that caught my attention more than the rest of the scenes.  I wished they used the Tavors more because it went well with the theme.

The twist towards the end caught me off guard and for that I gave it an extra star. I hate to spoil it for anyone so I won't explain it. Overall it lacked a cohesive build up but good action scenes.",1462579200,,743,4.21830985915493

As a writer myself, I have to say that the plotting really isn't the best.  Some of it is also pretty unbelievable (like falling from the upper atmosphere and deploying a parachute at the last minute, then walking away without a scratch). Moreover, the dialogue made me laugh in a few places where it shouldn't have - like telling the girl with the gaping wound in her abdomen that she was going to die, as if this wasn't already obvious. But, all of that being said, I still found myself entertained.  I like Danielle Chuchran's screen presence.  She's very good in action roles, and manages to be an intimidating warrior while still looking and acting feminine, which not every actress can pull off.  I'm also amazed at how talented she is physically. I could be wrong, but it seems like she does most, if not all, of her own stunts, which includes various kinds of combat, leaping from cliffs, rock climbing, and bareback horse back riding.  She's a big part of why I'm giving the movie three stars.  I also did enjoy seeing Kevin Sorbo, and had to laugh at the name Captain Hunter - I wonder if that was meant to be a nod to the TV series Andromeda, where he played Captain Dylan Hunt.",1460332800,,1323,4.491666666666666

The flesh-eating monsters are a Sleestak/Morlockcombo, and then there are the local human inhabitants, who's speech consists of a buzzing/gurgling sound. Then you have a few of them that have British accents.

I hope you like watching the main character run, because she does, and if she isn't running through this desert wasteland, she's kicking the butt of guys wearing motorcycle gear and ski goggles... then back to more running.

Well now it is time to get to the meat of the movie. WARNING: It for sure is a low budget film so don't expect much on props, acting, costumes...etc. Just talking about the costumes of the planet natives is enough. The actors for the planet natives look like they came to the job in whatever sports or typical post apocalyptic gear they could find in their own closets. I would let that slide if the masks they wore had any purpose at all. The supposed language barrier would have been enough to keep the mystery. There's no need for masks that have no purpose...unless they're hiding the fact that their extras are horribly disfigured!! oh the poor disfigured extras! D: The other majorly annoying thing was the com. Somehow the main lead was able to use hers throughout the movie, but for some unknown reason only a few others could even use their coms...some for next to no time. Could you give us a reason? Such as if you break that arm it stops functioning...or if you loose to much blood..or SOME PLAUSIBLE REASON besides the fact that only ONE PERSON seems to be able to use it consistently. If it wasn't for the annoying lack of consistency in the story I wouldn't have minded the plot too badly but it feels like they didn't think through the background of things which helps w/ the consistency of a story.

6823511,3,B00PV09C3U,"As low budget films go, this one is neither great nor bad.  Danielle Chuchran does a decent job with the lead role and the modest script.

The story setup is pretty simple:  some calamity has befallen Earth and the last human survivors launch out in several spaceships to try to find a habitable world to colonize and survive.  One of these receives a ""signal"" of some kind and tries to follow it to a new planet only to crash-land and encounter hostile aliens.

Danielle Chuchran plays the lead role among the survivors, and Kevin Sorbo appears in a supporting role as a leader and father-figure.  Churchan has screen presence and decent acting skills, enough to make us care about her character within the constraints of a modest storyline and only basic character development.  There are a fair number of action and combat sequences, and Chuchran handles these well.  The fight choreography won't win any awards, but it is one of the stronger elements of the film and builds enough tension to be uncertain of the outcome at times.  There are some brief funny moments here and there of the cheesy variety to lighten up the mood a bit, and the Utah landscape for the alien planet settings is quite nice to look at.

If you are looking for a way to pass some time, this isn't a bad choice.  It's not a great film, but Chuchran's performance and screen presence keep you engaged along with some credible action sequences.  I would like to see her appear again sometime in something with a stronger script.",1450483200,,1504,4.65530303030303

I thought it was pretty good, albeit somewhat confusing at first, because of some of the life on the planet dressed similar to one another, and it was hard to tell who was ""maybe"" enemy, and ""true"" enemy.  It became clear reasonably fast though.  The action is fairly fast and furious, sneaky and clandestine... it tends to keep your attention to the situation, which is a good thing.  Without spoiling the ending, which you probably begin to suspect about a third of the way through the movie, it was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I'll probably watch it again at some point.  The technology portrayed would be unbelievable to older folks that are not up to date with today's fast growing abilities with ""smart"" devices, and other technical capabilities of today.  The most unbelievable portion of the movie though, is the premise that the sun strips away the natural planetary protection that earth enjoys, and due to this, causes wormholes to form in many places in space.  (rather ridiculous, in my opinion, because you know that there are quadrillions of planets throughout the universe, and billions of them just in our own Milky Way galaxy, and surely there are planets being destroyed someplace, yet science has yet to detect a wormhole)  Ignoring some of the stuff like that, it's still a fun movie to watch.",1446940800,4,1457,4.772908366533865

Personally, I can't stand people that pretend to be a movie critic. They think their opinion actually means anything to a real person looking for a halfway decent film to entertain them and pass the time and usually love the liberal cr4p the studios put out these days that are mostly ripoffs and remakes of years gone by because they don't have a new idea in their collective heads.

Fortunately, she eventually finds a horse, which somehow obviates the need to climb any more mountains, at least for a little while.  But, don't you worry, they get back to climbing things again soon.  A really big mountain.  Some cliffs and hills and gullies.  And some caves.  Lots of caves.

Still, all in all, it's a fun popcorn movie.  If you go in expecting Interstellar, you're going to be disappointed.  If you go in thinking something more like the movie Stargate, you'll be closer to the mark.  3.5 stars.",1443312000,,819,4.643356643356643

Danielle is quite a horse rider, archer (toxophilite). She apears to do all or a lot of her own stunts, including fight scenes, and some serious rock climbing.  This is not for young children, there are monstrous humanoids that eat humans alive and do it on camera in a few scenes and when fighting with her hatchets she is intense.  Outside of the gore and potential for child trauma (nightmares) this is a PG family movie.

6823817,1,B00PV09C3U,"Based on the cover pose, you expect a Hunger Gamesesque movie.  Instead, you get a bigger budget version of CW's ""The 100,"" and sadly, isn't even as good.  It is virtually the SAME plot:  Earth has become uninhabitable.  They (whoever ""they"" may be) send people into space to find a new Earth, end up crash landing back on Earth after ""X"" amount of years in space to find that the inhabitants left behind have changed into something Primal. Then they get kidnapped by the natives, and as you may guess, the young female Heroine named Kay (played by Danielle Chuchran) has to step-up and take charge of what little crew remain, to ensure their survival.  Why Kay you may ask?, Because the MEN on the mission are ALL so inferior to her and must submit to her blond good looks, tight buns, superior fighting skills and strong will. However, In this big budget version (I mean that as sarcastically as possible because the CW's weekly TV saga has better writing, characters, plot development, sets, special effects... etc., ad nauseam), they add in sub-standard wormhole theory (ROCKS??  In wormholes??  REALLY??), bad CGI, Mad Max costuming, Demon-like monsters (because having the indiginous population trying to kill you after you crash land your ship just isn't enough), and Kevin Sorbo (trumpets sound) - the crews fatherly (elderly, more like) Captain who is also injured and needs to be rescued by Kay.  Oh, and a horse.  Don't forget to add in a horse for good measure.

This Sci-Fi film is most definitely aimed at a younger, female audience. There is no swearing, no sex, no nudity.  Just a good looking, well-built, athletic blond who spends approximately 1/3 of the movie running, jumping, climbing, posing and fighting in black spandex.  The plot was played, the dialogue and characters were under developed and boring.

Also, based on The Hunger Games knockoff cover picture, isn't it a tad coincidental that Danielle Chuchran played Katniss back in 2010 in a short feature hoping to get an audition for the role of Katniss Eberdeen?  Even so, the ""star"" of the movies is still listed as Kevin Sorbo, because Danielle just isn't a name that draws viewers, yet he is a minor character at best.  He should be listed as a Special Guest Star.  If you are just THAT bored, Danielle is the only thing that is worth watching, otherwise take a pass on thus one.",1441411200,,2363,4.783251231527093

There are lots of issues regarding production value and you can spot the low-budget special effects, but SciFi, regardless of how big the budget, requires you to suspend your ideas of reality.  It's thespians doing what they do best; acting like they're really believing what they're doing and saying.  You really believe these people if you can suspend disbelief.  Sure, there are some silly parts that don't make sense like the natives speaking English AND some silly Klingon whatever, but so what?  It could happen.  Sure, you wonder why they misplaced their navigation charts and don't realize where they are until halfway through the movie.  It could happen.  Still, it's a fun movie.

6824094,5,B00PV09C3U,"Terrific movie! It's a B-movie, but a very good one! It's got a happy ending. The Hero gets the Girl. ( I'm a sap for a happy ending. ) Kevin Sorbo plays a fantastic father figure for the heroine. He gives her a strange dowry - he teaches her hand to hand combat, which is.......peculiar....but in the context of this story, it works. Love the scene with the horse. It even has an adorable waif. The Hero gets the Girl story structure works although we see things from the heroines perspective. It's has violence, but no gratuitous sex or nudity or profanity. Give me a horse, an adorable waif, a strong father figure, a brave hero and an intrepid heroine, add a good music track ( which this has ) and I'm sold! Hope they make a sequel!

A very quick reply to the comments below about the ' holes ' in the story plot.  First, it's a movie, it's SciFi, and that is common.  Is there any ' scientific ' explaination for the elements of Star Trek stories such as ' warp drive ', ' set phasers to stun ' or ' the Vulcan Mind Meld ""? There isn't.

This movie does have some science behind the science fiction. Three quick examples:

1. The Heroine has to climb some forbidding rock formation to gain high ground for radio communcations with her commander and comrades. This is factual. Radio towers are placed on high ground or atop high builldings.
2. There is a relativistic time element. One year on the ' mother ship ' is equal to 10 years on the planets surface due to the temporal effects of the relativistic near-light speed of the mother ship.  This is factual.
3. The scout ship disintegrates in flight leaving a debris field which covers a very large area.  This is an important plot point and anyone who studies aircraft disasters can attest to the factual basis here.

This particular 'SciFi ' movie actually has a good scientific basis for the story.  That's not needed for a good story, but in this case the comments below aren't correct. These aren't ' holes ' in the story, they are scientifically based story elements.",1437609600,,2031,4.467567567567568

This movie suffers heavily from a case of serious overacting.  Kevin Sorbo, a man who has leant his name to mediocre movies and shows over the years still draws a paycheck in this one.  However, it's unlikely you're going to watch it because he's there.

As a film this depends on your generosity to continue to watch it.  I did like some of the animated critters but the ""bad guys,"" c'mon, let's be serious, they were horrid. I really liked that they were courteous enough to fight her one at a time.  Otherwise, they would have kicked her a55 and ended the film an hour earlier.

After looking at reviews for this film I was not expecting much going in. most people seemed to dislike this movie and downplayed it. I think that may have actually helped out a bit when I went into this. I was going to get it regardless because Kevin Sorbo was in it. So when I did pick it up I headed over to my brothers house with a few friends for our little all night movie marathons [only when we all have off the next day]. This was the second or third on the list that night and by the end of it there was a mixed reaction in the room.

Kate Mitra [Danielle Chuchran] is one of the last people alive in the universe. She is a solider under Captain Hunter [Kevin Sorbo] who leads this group looking for a planet that could house them. After coming upon a distress signal they make their way for its origins to find such a planet waiting for them. Things don't go as planned as they crash land on the planet to find monsters and murderous humans hunting them down.

Now like I said the room was mixed and split on how we felt about it, some of us enjoyed [me included] while the rest didnt. Now since I read all these bad reviews I had low expectations and I think it helped. I liked how the story played out and how it ended. The action was good and I liked the whole cliffhanger like scenes that some seemed to hate. Sure it was to show off its star but why not. Danielle is a pretty girl and could pull off everything the role required. I thought she did a great job here.

Also I have to point out the whole reason I bought the flick, Kevin Sorbo. As always he was great and played his part very well. In fact I thought everyone in the film did a good job, including writer/director John Lyde. I have enjoyed some other films of his including the other Kevin Sorbo flick One Shot and the zombie film Ozombie. All you get as far as special features is the trailer, like One Shot I wish there was a commentary. Also I want to point out that the creatures on here looked cool, I liked them.",1436918400,3,2007,4.125319693094629

I am wondering if he just allowed his name to be a draw for the movie cause he did very little to make a showing though it could have been his health. It was stated in one of his interviews many years back that he had a bad back which would limit his participation in a good action film. Sorbo is a good actor but here something had a muzzle on his talent. All in all a good movie for a party where missing a lot of the film won't stop you from understanding it.

I'm not sure when my stomach turned but I'm thinking it was when the actresses fell from their spacecraft that had just exploded in orbit and they landed on the planet just feet from the shore where horses roamed and crazy people lived and some 1970's monsters were trying to eat them. Yawn. Snore. Perhaps I had already destroyed any sense of fairness after spending 15 minutes prior trying to get interested in Bong Of The Dead (bongs and zombies - what's not to like?) but 15 minutes of the guys who didn't make it into the Not-so-smart-hiney Movie Franchise (ok - so Amazon won't print the actual name of the movie even though they sell it - here, you can buy it here  - http://www.amazon.com/Dumbasses-Caught-Tape-Dumbasses-Movie/dp/B00019GI6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434679844&sr=8-1&keywords=dumbass+movie) - ....which left me brain dead.

The story picks up after 40 years in space, a new generation of 20 somethings in training under the direction of the captian, resident old guy (Kevin Sorbo).  Three main trainees occupy the smart mouth overconfident jock, whiney coward, and shapely heroine slots in the cast.  A signal coming from the nearby discovered wormhole causes the captain and a landing party to send a patrol to investigate the signal, and seconds after entering the wormhole, exit into an asteroid field where the ship is destroyed.  Somehow, you can fall from an asteroid belt into the Earth Atmosphere, and land safely in the ocean.  From there, the story twists and morlock equivalents are hunting the survivors, as are some gas mask tribes of resident humans.  Most of the story is about the feisty heroine (it's a rock climber movie really) getting to the captain, who is holed up in a cave with a broken leg.
Along the way she beats some of the morlocks, finds a horse (space horses are so rare), and befriends one of the tribesman after she attacks him while he is trying to save her form the morlock.

They scatter through space looking for a new home to settle on.  One ship captained by Kevin Sorbo picks up a mysterious signal through a wormhole and sends a scout ship to investigate and determine if they have indeed found a new home.  The only problem is that there are already 2 varieties of indigenous folks living there already, and they aren't very friendly at all, no sir.  Now one of the crew must fight against all odds to be a SURVIVOR!

6824617,5,B00PV09C3U,"I really enjoyed this movie. Five stars for me. Not because it was anchored by Academy Award Winners or it was directed by some legendary figure. No, I enjoyed it because it did what it set out to do on a budget that would make other productions laugh. This movie kept me entertained from beginning to end. That is a rarity, no matter the budget. The acting was very good. The story wasn't something we haven't seen before, but these days what story is? The location was outstanding. Great visuals. Shot in Utah and it shows. I don't know exactly where they shot it, but the smooth rocks, bizarre rock formations and the overall area made for an excellent location for this shoot. Will there be a lot of people out there to agree with me on this? Who knows, I suspect not. I am very generous when I review. If I am entertained and I try to think of negatives and they don't come to mind then why would I give it anything but full marks? Kevin Sorbo is one of those B-genre, fantasy genre guys that I have enjoyed over the years. His work has always entertained me, so he is a winner in my book. Danielle Chuchran is the real lead in this movie and she does an outstanding job. She is pretty bad azz in this. She is in amazing shape. A lot of physical work for her. A lot of running, jumping, fighting with weapons and more. The creatures on this planet were well done by the effects department. Bravo on that one. Great effects both on the ground and in the air.

Next time, put your money in some penny stocks or a cubic zirconia mine... you would have a better chance on a return.
The aliens were laughable (I really have seen better ones on old Flash Gordon videos), the props were childish, and the special effects really put the 'special' in special effects.  Kevin Sorbo's works as a biker and barbarian are like watching Sir John Gielgud compared to this drivel.
I really hate to be so, seemingly, mean about this review, but please, if you were involved in this film, really, for your own sakes, consider a move to a different career path.  There still is time to make something meaningful of your life.  None of you belongs in film (this abortion is to film what Saddam Hussein's boys were to philanthropy and human rights causes).

If you're a guy looking for the next hot female actress, check her out.
  As many have said, this is a low budget movie. Plot and special effects are a little thin, but the acting from Danielle, Kevin Sorbo, and the others are good, including the stuntmen. It was Danielle who elevated this to 5 stars with her outstanding action scenes and her very credible dialog bouncing off Kevin Sorbo's warm personality. Surprisingly enjoyable movie.

6824644,2,B00PV09C3U,"I'm a fan of low budget films, the skill of the actors rarely annoys me & same with the CGI, Costumes, Make Up, etc. For me it is all about the story, and how it holds up throughout the movie.

Right from the start there were too many holes & inconsistencies, and this persisted all the way to the end of the move. When Kate lands on the planet, some how she lands a good 10 - 20 minutes before everyone else and the ship she was in lands. This created one of the first ""action"" scenes as there was falling wreckage around her as she ran.

Never mind she falls in water and somehow knows how to swim even though she's been on a ship her entire life. I can get over this, but then she is able to go and save a girl from drowning as well, this is incredibly difficult even for an experienced swimmer.

Then it turns out that Kate has a full computer and body scanner in her arm that lets you know your vitals, etc. Everyone on the ship has this computer, yet Kate is the only one that uses it to find out what's wrong with their bodies? Why can't anyone else scan themselves? (Oh, and we know it's possible to scan oneself because Kate does this as well).

In several of the fighting scenes one alien is almost too much for Kate to handle, and then later on (after she is more tired & hurt) she is able to take on 6 - 8 at a time.

One of the groups of aliens wears a type of ""End of the world"" gas mask. First initial thought ""oh, that alien form can't breath on the surface, okay that makes sense"" Nope, they're just wearing these masks that block their line of vision and make them worse off, just because they can.

These are just a few of the many holes & inconsistencies in this movie. It's hard to follow the story and stay attentive to the whole thing because of this.",1433030400,25,1774,4.083333333333333

Kevin Sorbo. What can I say? I'm in my 40's, he'll always be Hercules to me. ;)

So seriously, the acting by most is better than your average B-movie. The special effects are better than your average B-movie, and the story is actually pretty good. Why only three stars then? Well....I just couldn't get past these things:

It started out really quite good...but it seemed to be an entirely different movie once they crashed. Danielle Chuchran is a decent actress, but not THAT good. Not enough to make me believe she can re-set her own displaced wrist, and then immediately use it to fight, rock climb, fight some more, climb a few more cliffs and oh yeah - pull herself up onto a horse. Then there are those fight scenes. *sigh*  Even so, I can suspend belief, but the biggest sigh comes from the mutated creatures. They're just really bad.  No. Really.

Oh, by the way we happen to  be on a hostile savage planet with a mix of Mad Max characters and rejects from the really really bad monster make up department.  Keep grinning, before you know it, the girl happens upon a campfire where behold! a bridle and bit happen to be lying around.  Oh, and upon closer examination, you'll probably notice the very 20th century buckles and snaps on the bridle...keep grinning, it only gets funningly worse.  I give cudo's to Kevin Sorbo for trying to make this seem like more than just a paycheck to him.  Sorry, I don't recall the actress's name but she sure has game and does a great pose on the cover.

I have to give credit to the film makers knowing that this would never be a contender for the Oscars just an escapist flick good for a rainy afternoon's pleasure.  Hey, it was free with my Amazon's prime membership so can't complain that it was a waste of money!",1432080000,4,1355,4.2952755905511815

6824690,3,B00PV09C3U,"Definitely low budget but at least some time was spent on decent creature makeup and fair cg effects.  Unfortunately, there were instances of cheesy makeup that caught my eye, and the acting, while not bad, did seem forced coming from some of the characters.  Inconsistencies might not bother most people, but annoyed me.  For example, main character travels 40 km, partially on horseback, to come to the aid of her injured captain.  Shortly after, she's right back to where she was when she started (creature lair).  I wish that film makers in general would take small and simple steps toward realism. Characters should actually be dripping wet when just coming out of the water instead of lightly damp.  Mascara shouldn't stay on for a whole movie (should it even exist in this place and time?) and the main character is attractive enough without it.  Minor nitpicks of mine. I fast-forwarded through a lot of parts and don't feel I missed anything.  I probably shouldn't have bothered, but I started it to kill some time and accomplished at least that.",1431993600,13,1055,4.854748603351955
6824691,3,B00PV09C3U,"This film appears to enjoy divided reviews marked by many differing opinions on its value.  I liked it and think the stunt work and effects are better than average and it follows a familiar story line to viewers of the first Planet of the Apes and the Time Machine.  So, no it is not an entirely original idea, but it plays out with a certain ferocity and credibility in action and dialogue, which might have have a good series made for cable.  It's worth a watch and that makes it better than I might have thought when I read the films synopsis initially!",1431907200,2,556,4.378640776699029
6824692,3,B00PV09C3U,"The plot, acting and most of the special effects were very good considering this is a low budget B movie. It was good to see Kevin Sorbo in the captains chair again. He's a fine actor and I'd love to see him get better roles.

The dialog and script were extremely weak. The entire movie consisted of run run run... fight fight fight... then run run run and fight. There were only a couple of moments where there wasn't ridiculously loud background music playing.  At times I thought I was watching an old 1960 scifi movie.  The best scene was the mother ship coming into the atmosphere at the end.

But Danielle Chuchran showed decent acting chops in a predictable (for jaded SciFi fans) story of a fleet of spaceships fleeing a dying Earth. For those not immersed in the arcane SciFi genre, the appearance of a horse pretty well nails down where it's going.

For aficionados of cheap SciFi movies you'd expect more exposed female flesh or, at least,  explicit lycra-adhering views. Though I hoped for such displays of pulchritude, none appeared, but I was not disappointed, the movie was okay.",1429142400,,564,5.043010752688172

6824703,2,B00PV09C3U,"The film centers on Kay (Danielle Chuchran) which is not short for Katniss, but should be judging by the cover pose. The earth became uninhabitable for kittens so seven ships left through  wormholes to seek out other planets. Kay gives us a monologue to catch us help, spouting bad science to weave a tale. She stays in shape in a simulator where they learn to shoot and play war games. They quickly crash land on a planet which is inhabited by unfriendly aliens who speak a German version of sand creature and wear a Heinz 57 combinations of Mad Max respirators. There are also unfriendly aliens who look like they came from a 1950's film. K manages to save most of the crew by herself, except Anne (Abigail Mason) who was prettier.

Kay has a number of skills apparently acquired in the simulator not shown such as the bow, axe throwing, horse riding, and rock climbing.

The film is a Sci-Fi film aimed at a younger audience. There is no swearing, no sex, no nudity...heck no one even talks about a shower. The dialogue was boring. The characters were boring.

Danielle Chuchran played Katniss back in 2010 in a short feature hoping to get an audition for the role. The Utah company that made this film is also the same one that made Orc Wars/Dragonfyre which accounts for the lack of a quality script. 2 stars for most adults, although I am sure some kids and fans of Danielle Chuchran will enjoy the feature.

I even skipped ahead in most of the action parts. I knew who was going to win in any battle involving Kate. I didn't need any buildup of tension. After watching the first two action scenes, I realized that it wasn't worth the time. It was a predictable storyline that would only have worked with pretty people as heroes and ugly people as bad guys. Good thing they had both in abundance.

Interesting story, worthy of about 25 minutes of film. Look at it this way. You've always wanted to be a Hollywood editor. Now's your chance to leave most of this film on the cutting-room floor.
