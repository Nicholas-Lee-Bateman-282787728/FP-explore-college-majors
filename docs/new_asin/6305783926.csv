7894538,4,6305783926,"James Coburn heads the cast of this Hallmark Hall of Fame movie.  The story is centered around the accidental death of the wife and mother of a well-to-do ranch family.  Coburn, the father, never forgave his son, the one who happened to be driving when the accident happened.  That's all in the past.  The bulk of the story happens in Mexico, where the son now lives and has a highly successful career as a painter -- that career provides another point of stress between father and son.
The father travels to Mexico to try to help his son when the son is involved in another car accident, this one a hit-and-run resulting in another death.
I enjoyed this Hallmark offering greatly, but for me it's a half-step down from other Hallmark movies like ""Sarah, Plain and Tall,"" ""The Love Letter,"" or ""Decoration Day.""
Definitely a solid 4-star offering.  You'll be glad you watched this one.
Have a great day!
