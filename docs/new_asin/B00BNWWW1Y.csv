5661286,2,B00BNWWW1Y,"You could tell they were on a very limited budget to make this movie. The message about Christians not taking the Mark of the Beast was good, but the acting was terrible. The plot was shotty. It's definitely a B or C movie. Would not recommend. There are much better Christian movies out there that go over this subject. Not a good movie. Would not recommend at all.",1370217600,2,366,4.397058823529412

5661298,1,B00BNWWW1Y,"Shot on location in a vacant field next to a trailer park. One of the worst movies I have ever watched. The acting was terrible. All of them keep moving their hair out of their faces. The lead actress finally puts a beanie on another cuts his hair so they stop playing with it towards the end. Poorly written, directed and acted. Would actually like to see a good movie based on the book of Revelations.",1503964800,,403,4.315789473684211

5661300,3,B00BNWWW1Y,"I've been a Christian for 66 years & I wholeheartedly believe in the message of this film; and, like many, many other Christians, I believe the Rapture could happen any day.  If only one person accepts Christ as his/her Savior & Lord, it would make the creation of this film worth it.  I feel that the horrors of the Tribulation were greatly downplayed. They fell far short of what Revelation prophesies.  My Dad was a pastor w/ a near genius level IQ.  I learned so much sitting under his ministry for 24 years...I have him to thank for my understanding of end times prophecy.

That said, I would most highly recommend the ""LEFT BEHIND"" series of both books & movies.  They are much more accurate and better done than anything else I've seen or read.

Most importantly, hear the message & be willing to overlook the imperfections.",1502150400,3,831,4.612244897959184

In one case, we see people trusting in their human strength and willpower (driven by some end times learning) and then another with less learning buoyed by the peace and power of God.

5661327,3,B00BNWWW1Y,"Unless you're a Christian who knows a lot about the Book of Revelations, you're not really going to understand what is going on in this movie.  Even though it is geared mostly towards Christians, a lot of information needed to be inserted in order to fully explain the events taking place in the world.  A flashback at the beginning, with some voice over narration about what was going on, would have clarified the story and given it more substance.  Because this is a low budget film, the acting is not exactly top notch--though not all of the actors were bad.  The best thing about this movie is the surprise ending, which made me add another star to my rating.  It was unexpected, and if you really believe we are in the End days and that you may possibly have to one day choose between getting the Mark or your head severed from your body, it will give you a lot to think about.  Other than that, it had a lot of potential, but could have been better.",1484784000,,955,4.367231638418079

5661388,5,B00BNWWW1Y,"The cheesy acting portrayed by the so-called Christians of the resistance, in my experience, being around many religions, faiths, and cults, the movie portrayed the Christian cattle 100% accurate, because in my experience, people who believe in any God of their choosing only have faith as a means of connection.  You can't see or touch faith.  Most religious people will always think when a situation is absolute the worst it could be, that it's only a two on a scale of a million.  Whether that's ignorance or stupidity, not for me to judge.  But if you're willing to die for Jesus Christ when face to face with a guilloutine, and they would use a guiloutine for intimidation, because who wouldn't it scare the hell out of.  With that said, if you lose your head because of your faith in Jesus Christ, the old good Book says you will reign 1,000 years with Christ.  Whether that's true or not will test anyone's faith.

I thought they did a very good job of getting the message across. The emotions were genuine and I applaud the actors for a job well done.

The end times are going to be the final test for all humans that are not taken in the Rapture, but it will also be a second chance to be with Jesus. Do not take the Mark of the Beast! If you have to die for your Christian faith, then so be it. God will reward you in the end.",1477612800,,570,4.0

5661402,1,B00BNWWW1Y,"Taking the Book of Revelations as the basis for a movie could start you on the road to something kind of cool. Instead, this film takes you no place. Incredibly banal writing compounded with horrid acting makes this one of the 10 worst movies Ive ever watched to the end. But not in a ""so bad it was fun"" way, just in a very sad I hope no one involved ever watches it way.

It was so awful that if they had managed to design a New World Order mark that was a smidge less horrendously ugly the movie would have instantly been 90% better. More importantly, if it explained why hanging out at the local burger joint while fascist are running the world is OK but having the Wal-Mart starburst slapped on your forehead is somehow beyond the pale I would have learned something. When dialogue includes someone speaking about her boyfriend's fear of being taken by saying ""I vaguely remember him saying something about staying below the radar"" you are definitely in trouble.  Is this the worlds most vapid girlfriend or is he the worlds most confused boyfriend?

Lastly, though I could not think about it while watching this travesty, it is an insult to the hundreds of beautiful films that touch on the real horror of the holocaust. Real people were forced to wear the Star of David or pink or a myriad of other triangles by real fascists. And millions of them were murdered. N.W.O. trivialized that by implying somehow thats how the end of days will come.  It was all too awful to make fun of.",1473724800,,1488,4.479704797047971

I didn't expect too much, since let's be honest, a lot of christian films just really aren't that good overall, from lighting to acting. The acting was actually really decent, although a couple people had trouble reacting authentically to trauma, but that is pretty normal for a lot of people.. It's just a skill you have to learn or (sadly) experience. Overall though I thought it was pretty amazing. I really didn't expect it to be this good.
Tip for future christian movie screenwriters on Revelations though: in reality this would be a situation where more than just christians would be targeted. Anyone not wanting the mark whether for religious, political, freedom, etc. issues would be targeted. And people would have to work together as outcasts no matter what in order to stay alive and un-caught. The movie did a good job highlighting that fact by speaking often of a ""resistance"", but in a real situation like this, Christians are unlikely to be the only ones targeting, or rebelling against receiving the mark. With high technology, the mark could even turn people into basically living zombies or sims, leaving them perhaps, with no ""soul"" left in them. Your most likely going to have all sorts of people of all religions, nations, backgrounds, even orientations who most likely would refuse the mark, whatever that mark may be. Just a suggestion ;)
The movie itself though was actually really good, good job and keep up the great work!",1447113600,2,1498,4.87843137254902

2.  There was an unnecessary amount of blood toward the end of the movie that did nothing but make the movie a little on the disturbing side.
3.  The main character knew the cost of taking the mark and encouraged her friend to stay strong and then when it came down to the wire, she gave in???  This was a completely unnecessary twist.
4.  There were unnecessary sound effects at the very end of the movie as they could not show the final scene without getting an R rating.  Cutting to black would have been just as effective. .
