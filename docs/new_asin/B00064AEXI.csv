Fritz Lang is one of my favoritest directors, and this lesser-known film, his final silent, was nothing less than the riveting high-quality product I've come to expect from him.  Like a couple of his other films, it does take awhile for the story and characters to be fully set up and for the viewer to be drawn in, but once things do finally start happening, it just gets better and better.  Lang loved long films, and just like with a book that runs over the ""normal"" length, such a film too naturally will take a bit longer in setting up the plot and characters.  And since it runs to almost three hours, it doesn't need to get everything and everyone established lickety-split and to have everything wrapped up nicely and neatly in an unrealistic amount of time.

Wolf Helius is a prominent scientist who works in the rocket business and who is deeply interested in space exploration.  Professor Georg Manfeldt is an eccentric older friend of his who has been reduced to poverty and disgrace because of his obsessive research into the existence of gold on the Moon.  Prof. Manfeldt talks Helius into financing his dream expedition to finally prove his 30-year-old theory right.  Helius's best friend and chief engineer Hans Windegger is persuaded to come along too, and Windegger's fiance Friede, whom Helius also loves, insists she join all of them.  The expedition and the preparations for it turn out to be anything but routine, since some rival elements know all about their plans and the belief that there is gold on the Moon.  One of these criminals, Turner, also joins the flight.  During the flight and after the rocket has successfully landed (despite having a number of potentially serious technical problems), human nature gets the better of everyone, and jealous rivalries, pettiness, and greedy self-interest start erupting right and left.  It all builds up to a great ending, made even better by how it's not one of those endings the average viewer could have predicted coming a mile away.

Though it naturally will appear a bit dated today, in an era where space travel is a reality and not a sci-fi fantasy, the space technology actually seems pretty advanced and accurate for 1929.  I'd personally consider a lot of the sci-fi films of the Fifties and early Sixties to be a lot more dated.  As has been mentioned, the scientific staff consulting for this film did know about some of the things that ended up depicted in a rather unrealistic matter (esp. the fact that people had air to breathe on the Moon!), but it possibly was left that way because the average moviegoer might not have liked the alternate.  There are also a number of plotholes that are never resolved or explained, such as just how Helius was knocked out in the taxi when Manfeldt's papers were stolen from him, why anyone is supposed to believe there's gold on the Moon, what purpose some of the people on the flight are supposed to serve apart from dramatic tension between the characters, and what exactly happens to Manfeldt after he finds his gold.  Still, relatively minor problems aside, this is one compelling film, one which deserves to be ranked higher among Lang's phenomenal work.",1191715200,4,3206,4.81056466302368
2165432,4,B00064AEXI,"""Frau im Mond"" (Woman in the Moon) is a German silent movie of 1929, direct by the great Fritz Lang (""Metropolis"" fame), and deals with a trip to the moon. It is not the first to deal with a voyage to the moon -- that honor goes to George Melies 1902 film, ""Le Voyage dans la lune"" (Trip to the Moon) -- but it is the first to treat the subject realistically. Along with the 1950, ""Destination Moon,"" it belongs to a trio of films which educated the public on space travel, and provided training for future space scientists, aerospace engineers (I was one), and astronauts.

It is based on a novel of the same name, written by Lang's wife, Thea von Harbou. (She also wrote ""Metropolis,"" and it is probably due to her that a strong woman's role was included in the film.) The name of the film, ""Woman in the Moon,"" definitely sounds silly, but is probably a play on the-man-in-the-moon theme. It also reflects the importance of the feminine character to the plot.

The evolution in technical emphasis is very revealing. Melies makes no effort to be technically sound (other that selecting Jules Verne's cannon over the even less plausible anti-gravity ""Caverite"" of Wells). ""Frau im Mond"" does make a serious attempt. In fact, its rocket is in many ways more realistic than that of the 20-year-later ""Destination Moon."" This realism is largely due to the great rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, who acted as technical advisor. The launch gantry and launch sequence count-down found in the film were prescient. At the same time, there are curious lapses. Too much is made of the point at which the earth and moon gravity cancel each other - there is nothing very special about this point. In particular, it is not responsible for weightless in space. That Oberth would make such a mistake is inconceivable. Perhaps the makers of the film (principally Fritz Lang) believed the public would not buy weightlessness without this plausible, though spurious, explanation. Incidentally, the film was not a great triumph for Oberth. He was to have produced a flying rocket model for the film. His failure to provide one in time hurt his standing as a practical hands-on engineer.

Another gaffe is that the moon would have enough air for humans to breathe.  Again, I suspect the makers of the film knew better, but wanted to avoid the complications of space suits. (Would you really want to hide Friede's sweet face in a helmet?) Then there is the ""dousing rod"" to find water ... enough said!  The business about ""lots of gold on the moon"" is also silly, but here there is a better explanation - or maybe I should say  excuse. When one recalls that during the making of this film Germany was suffering great economic hardships, including hyperinflation, the prospect of Germans finding an unlimited source of gold must have been irresistible.

I characterized this film as the middle one in a trio. There are of course other films which might have been somewhat less influential or less well done, but nevertheless contributed to the dawn of the space age. ""When Worlds Collide,"" ""Rocketship X-M,"" and ""The Conquest of Space"" are three such films. The list would not be complete with including the fine, non-fiction ""Man in Space"" series of Walt Disney.

This film has something of a cult following, and there are a number of websites devoted to it. One of the best is [...] .",1183075200,4,3363,4.7465753424657535
2165433,5,B00064AEXI,"Lang made this movie just a few years after Metropolis. There are a few common themes in the two: futuristic speculation, and the central position of love in rather unlikely affairs. I found it different in many ways, though.

First, it stayed closer to Lang's contemporary world. It also did a pretty good job with the science part of the science fiction, down to a realistic portrayal of NASA's Vertical Assembly Building. In fact, Lang's original description of acceleration in meters per second-squared was more accurate then the translated English caption, which used meters per second. Even though the movie stuck closer to Lang's own world, most of the movie has a much more modern look than his better-known Metropolis. The makeup and acting look more natural, at least early on, unlike the exaggerated and iconic posturings throughout Metropolis. And, although the scenes were new to audiences at the time, many Lang's elements have since become the common idiom of more recent films. That scene with the scheming powermongers (cigar-chomping woman included), in their film-equipped board room - it recurred in just about every James Bond movie to date.

A few things didn't work for me, though. I'll let the moon's breathable atmosphere slide, for dramatic convenience. The 1920s pacing got to me after a while: most of the action came in the last 45min of the 2hr 45min movie, and I found some early parts dragging. The one that I just had to grit my teeth and swallow, though, was the quest for gold (yes, that horrendously heavy stuff) as the big reason for going to the moon at all. Well, I guess Lang had to make it understandable in the idiom of the era, but I'm sure he could have done better.

Lang, the actors, and the production grew did quite well, though. Lang's Metropolis was an epic achievement. This movie approaches it, and maybe surpasses it in some ways. See Metropolis first, by all means, but see this one too.

2165434,5,B00064AEXI,"Just saw it today! I best love the sequence when they show the rocket ship taking off from earth. Amazing realistic and well detailed and even hardhitting it was. It is by far the best sequence in the film (but the musical score honestly helps it be). Well acted throughout and expertly filmed. much like Metropolis is this film (but more realism and depth). Fans of Met. should see this film (Lang's Dr. Mabuse films are good but they might disappoint people who already just know his Metropolis). Spoiler! I am left with a few unanswered questions for those who have seen the film already:

1)How does the rather puny professor successfuly shove big lug Walter Turner down the stairs? Was Turner drunk at the time?

2)Who exactly is Gustave? A relative of Helius's maid? Or chauffeur?

3)That Louise Brooks-esq cutie selling flowers on the street. How exactly did she successfully assualt Helius in his limo? Gun? Knife? Karate chop? Poison drink? And of the other flower lady selling at the time. Was she in Turner's employ too? Jeers btw to the poster who commented on Helius's looks. That flower-selling babe was the real attractive one of the whole piece.

4)Did that puny professor live or die on the moon? Can't tell.

5) Why was Gerde Maurus's Friede character referred to as The Student in the opening credits. She had a name in the film?

And to the poster who commented after me (creepy huh?): Der Mann is Walter Turner of Chicago.",1139097600,3,1443,4.7063492063492065
2165435,3,B00064AEXI,"Painstaking direction by Fritz Lang combines with sometimes ridiculous overwriting by wife Thea von Harbau to produce a mixed masterpiece.  The movie can be described as 1) crime thriller segueing into 2) eerily prescient science fiction descending into 3) soapy melodrama.  Lang's influence is most obvious in the middle section but the cumbersome plotline slows down the beginning and end.

We open with handsome Doctor Helius chewing scenery with an aged professor driven into poverty and near-insanity by the rejection of his theory that the moon's mountains are full of gold.  The good Doctor still believes in him, as do the 5 potentates (!) who control the world's gold supply and wish to corral the moon's as well.  This introduces an underworld spy played quite suavely by Fritz Rasp.

We also meet the eponymous Woman, Gerda Maurus, a lady with expressive eyes, no particular figure and a rather bad hair-do.  She is a jolly sort, though, as well as a much stronger individual than the jelly-backboned dames who pollute the post-WWII genre, and serves well enough as the love interest for both the good Doctor and his (mostly) loyal engineer Hans.

This all gets sticky for about an hour until we finally meet the Rocketship.  The roll-out of the Ship is a sequence of monumental power as the massive craft and supporting structure are slowly rolled out of the assembly building to the launch pad as the moon rises out of the searchlit gloom and crowds and photographers swarm beneath the juggernaut to the accompaniment of radio voice-over which, though completely unheard in a silent film, is so beautifully gestured that we understand exactly what the announcer is saying.

The whole launch and countdown scene is one of the greatest sequences in science fiction, full of painstaking detail, creating immense drive and drama but in a vein of complete human reality.  The added film score by Marsalis lends impetus particularly to this sequence.

Scenes of the craft in weightlessness are also well-grounded in physics (rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth was technical consultant).  Unfortunately the landing on the moon also lands us right back in the Harlequin romance script.  The lunar scenery leaves reality completely behind, while the whole hour-long Gold Syndicate subplot at the beginning basically evaporates into a bit of wrestling in the sand.

The romantic triangle is a good enough romantic triangle.  It just seems like a long way to go to have a soap opera.

Even so, the amazing middle part contains maybe the most powerful dramatization of real science that I have seen, inventing the countdown sequence now used routinely in space and military launches.  These scenes can be watched separately as a smaller, almost self-contained masterpiece within the much longer film.",1107561600,48,2796,5.107692307692307
2165436,4,B00064AEXI,"Frau im Mond has been given such a bum rap for so long that there never seemed to be much encentive to go out and find the darn thing.  Perhaps this discouragement was a good thing considering the film had for so long only been available in badly truncated condition.  The recently restored version deserves the kudos the critics have heaped upon it.  (However, it is a little frustrating and ironic that Metropolis will be the only major Lang film that will never be available in its original form.)

Yes, the restored Frau has some aspects of Mabuse early on, but nothing reaching the mind melting paranoia of that classic.  And yes, care was taken to add some degree of realistic conjecture to the piece.  But the recurring images of the 'Nick Carter"" pulp magazines (an obvious homage to Tarzan's Edgar Rice Burroughs and his popular John Carter of Mars series) really set the tone here.

This is the kind of sci-fi that was popular in the first half of the last century, with a little bit of futuristic technology thrown in with the heroes and villains and love interests.  Lang and Theo, for certain, are very capable craftsman who handle this genre well enough. However, if this film does not quite hit the  heights of some of their other collaborations, well that's not much a criticism.

Silent and coming in at almost three hours, this film may not be the first to come to mind for light entertainment.  But if you are a devoted Lang fan and have gotten through his more celebrated works already, you certainly won't be disappointed by this piece of diversion.",1106265600,16,1570,4.6521739130434785
2165437,4,B00064AEXI,"The impact that Fritz Lang's last silent movie would have on the world  is bigger than the impact his film has had on audiences.  By this i mean that although the influence of this film can be sensed everywhere--from real-world rocket launches to other space exploration stories--it remains relatively unknown to most people today.

To those who are familiar with it, even the severly edited version that had previously been available before this DVD release, it is most famous for its scientific accuracy in the launching of the rocket, and especially notable for the famous 5,4,3,2,1 countdown, which has since been the definitive rocket launch protocol.  Outside of the real world, Lang's vision of space travel proved to be the cinematic archetype for decades, until the new wave of 2001 and Star Wars.  It's influence can be seen directly and indirectly accross all genres, even in Abbott & Costello Go to Mars!

One of the common complaints about the story is the scientific inaccuracies, specifically the atmosphere on the moon.  It has been validly argued that Lang and his scientific advisors should have been aware that there is no atmosphere on the moon--and they were!  What most people overlook in their nitpicking is that the film clearly explains the theory of a partial atmosphere on the dark side of the moon.  While this is still scientifically inaccurate to those of us who never knew a time when man had not landed on the moon, this was actually a common device used in pre-Apollo science fiction, prevelant in the Fantastic Four comic books of the 60's (and still present in the Marvel Universe today).

Of course, the film is not limited just to a moon launch and landing.  There is a captivating spy thriller that leads up to the climactic voyage.  While it's not by any means as exciting as the special effects-oriented half of the story, it would still stand alone as an entertaining movie.

The film has been presented in exceptional clarity for a silent movie, but that's to be expected from industry-leader Kino.  My only real complaint about the DVD is the lack of special features, which should be mandatory for any movie with this much history.  To Kino's credit, it does include a gallery of fascinating images, ranging from the movie poster, to stills, and behind the scenes photographs.  However, it is the first time on DVD (or VHS as far as i can tell), and so an even better special edition will no doubt surface in a few years.

In the end, this film should not be elevated to more than it claims to be--the vision of a moon voyage in 1929--for as anything else it will fall short.  Still, it should not be viewed merely as a time-piece or a relic, for all science fiction can become absurd in retrospect.  Instead of looking back on it, it is best to look at it as a visionary forerunner looking ahead.",1102204800,17,2841,4.7145748987854255
2165438,5,B00064AEXI,"This is a beautifully restored edition of Fritz Lang's final silent film. Playing just 11 minutes short of 3 hours, the viewer must be a little patient as the story unfolds for the first hour or so. Its easy to let the aspect of space travel cause oversight to the character development and subplots as they unfold early in the film. When the rocket launch is about to take place, the characters are well developed and the spectacle of space travel takes center stage. Considering the 1929 knowledge of rocket science, many details of the trip to the moon are quite prophetic thanks to Lang's research into technology known at the time. The ending of the film works very well and the whole experience leaves the viewer with a real sense of time travel into the imagination of a great film maker. The new musical soundtrack by Jon Mirsalis is wonderful and appropriate. If you love silent film or science fiction, give Woman in the Moon consideration, it will reward you.",1101945600,9,970,4.678362573099415
2165439,5,B00064AEXI,"I had heard of Fritz Lang's WOMAN IN THE MOON for many years and had seen stills from it in sci-fi film anthologies but I was never sure if I would ever get to see it. Now that I have seen it I was totally unprepared for how taken I would be with it. It is absolutely astonishing how forward looking this film was (is). From a technical standpoint it was the 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY of its day. The latest technology of 1929 was used by Lang to depict a trip to the moon 40 years before it actually happened.

The attention to detail, always a Lang trademark, is on full display here. German scientists were consulted on the rocket and space sequences and chillingly give us a glimpse of the technology that would be employed by the Nazis during World War II. Even more chilling and prophetic is how the principal heavy is the spitting image of Hitler minus his mustache (and Hitler wanted Lang to be the Third Reich's filmmaker!). In addition to the technological aspects the human side of the story is also quite compelling. There's a love triangle, the crazy dreamer who isn't crazy, a global financial conspiracy and even an unwanted passenger aboard the rocket. Every technical science fiction film or series that follows (THINGS TO COME, 2001, even LOST IN SPACE to name but a few) owe a debt to WOMAN IN THE MOON. The performances are all first rate with Gerda Maurus in the title role and Fritz Rasp as the villain standing out but it's the story and the settings that really shine.

This new Kino version restores the film to it's almost 3 hour length and Jon C. Mirsalis' score is simple and extremely effective particularly in the rocket and lunar sequences. Once you see this movie you will be amazed at how many scenes you have seen elsewhere in other movies and TV shows. It's great to finally have the opportunity to see the source material at last...

2165440,5,B00064AEXI,"Well we finally get to see the full 161 minute version. Some of you may know that in 1930 the founders of the American Interplanetary society invited Swiss aviation pioneer Robert Esnault Pelterie to speak to their membership in NYC. As part of the event they decided to translate this Lang masterpiece into English. Unfortunately for the rest of us they gutted it down to about 80 minutes. Not only did they remove all the ""non-space"" stuff but they actually re-wrote the story by creating new title cards. Consequently the new version made little sense. Well finally here we have the uncut original with all title cards intact and a story line which actually makes sense. The print is almost perfect and the company in Europe are to be applauded for resurrecting this brilliant piece of work. German rocket pioneers Otto Willi Gail, Willy Ley and Hermann Oberth consulted on the space flight section and it shows.

2165525,4,B00064AEXI,"This German silent film is a very long movie, I watched it in two sittings.  A great concept ahead of its time - not only the first astronauts, a first woman astronaut!  The models and sets were magnificent, and the attention to technical detail, incredible.  There were also lots of human details; I loved how Hans rips his bow tie off in a fit of rage and, still in a rage, ties it again. Also funny; the professor taking his pet mouse with him.  From the anticipation of G-forces and weightlessness, to the non-linear trajectory, to the multi-stage rocket all I can say is Wow!  However, in many ways it was a document of its time; like rubbing the heroine's hand or giving the young stowaway liquor to regain consciousness, or using a divining rod to find water. One thing that was disconcerting; although it was distributed in 1929, four years before Hitler came to power, the crowd scenes seem to show some straight-arm salutes. The inaccuracies are as interesting as the things they got right.  Instead of 36 hours in the movie, it took the Apollo missions 3 days.  Also keep in mind that we never did actually see the far side of the moon until 1959 when the Soviets first photographed it.

The foresight demonstrated in terms of the technology was also surprising.  Rocket power, assembly in a huge storage building, transport to the launching pad via rail just like Saturns and Space Shuttles.  G-forces with horizontal support mechanisms equipped with springs.

Of course, there is the speed issue.  11,200 km/sec equals (by my spreadsheet) 25,038,720 mph.  They would have reached the moon in  0.009944598 hours, not 36.  They would have also been grease spots on the cabin floor, based on the acceleration! :-)  11,200 km/h would have been more believable.  Still only a tad over one half-hour transit time.  36 hour transit time would be about 6900 mph (11,111 km/h).

I thought the acting was appropriate for silent movies.  A bit overarching in the gestures, but not completely nutty.  Only a tad of the silent movie ""acceleration of running"" issue.

2165547,4,B00064AEXI,"Director Fritz Lang and writer Thea von Harbou are best known for their creation of the 1927 silent classic METROPOLIS, a film so elaborate that it came within inches of bankrupting UFA.  Two years Lang and von Harbou, then husband and wife, collaborated on yet another science fiction film, this one with less extreme designs but considerably more fact: released in 1929, WOMAN IN THE MOON reflected up-to-the-minute scientific thought about how mankind might reach the moon and what they might find when the arrived.

The actual story is somewhat melodramatic.  A group of scientists believe the moon is rich in gold.  They plan to travel to the moon--but are soon in the clutches of a criminal gang, which blackmails the scientists into including one of their number in the expedition.  At the same time, a woman engaged to marry one of the scientists demands she be included also because she secretly loves another member of the expedition.  Needless to say, a good many complications ensue.

Much of the film is naive--once on the moon, the expedition discovers breathable atmosphere, water, and gold--but at the same time the film includes a number of surprisingly forward notions.  This is the first known instance, in either fact or fiction, in which a ""count-down"" is used; it also involves a rocket that fires in stages, as later rockets (including the Apollo rockets) would; and the film makes an effort to depict weightlessness of space.  According to film historians, WOMAN IN THE MOON was a favorite of Wernher von Braun and his friends, and the depiction of the rockets were considered so realistic that the film was pulled in the early 1930s, when Nazi scientists began to work on such weapons.

The movie runs at a fast tempo, and it gives plent of scope for Lang's talent with talent for crowd scenes and fight sequences.  Much of the film was lost for many years, but it has been well restored, and the print is extremely good.  Recommend for fans of Lang, early science fiction, and German silent film.

With the help of Hermann Oberth and Willy Ley of the German Rocket Society, the technical details are impeccable for the era.  The special effects are wonders of 1929 movie making.

Several themes ran through this film, at least attempting to keep the viewer's interest. Honestly, I can see where this would have been a grand spectacle when it was made, but really, it's just too long. I fell asleep somewhere in the middle for about 20-30 minutes and I didn't feel like I missed much. The cinematography was superb, something I rather expected from a Lang film, and the actors on par with what one would expect from a silent movie. The music drove me nuts occasionally, so I just muted it. I did like the imagination behind the film, and thought perhaps scientists knew in the late 20's that there was no atmosphere or water on the moon, but I guess that didn't stop old Fritz. In any case, there were some decent ideas that foreshadowed the future of space travel, and I can see where this may have been a pilot for so many scifi movies in later years, but there were others, too, in this era, and they were just as good at guessing. Maybe worth a watch if you have this huge block of time to kill, and definitely worth it to see the excellent cinematography.

2165562,5,B00064AEXI,"As others have noticed, this movie was amazingly prescient for its time, and must be acclaimed the first really great space travel movie (though not the absolute first).  The forward-looking accuracy here is due certainly to Lang's consultation with leading German rocket scientists of the time.  Please bear with the first 45-50 minutes of the film, and the corny conspiracy plot that unspools ever so slowly; when the film finally gets the moon launch sequence, it's entirely worth the wait.  The most stunning thing in the movie for me was the building where the rocket is housed:  it's a huge building that, when the doors open and the rocket is slowly wheeled out on its gantry, ends up looking almost exactly like the giant Vehicle Assembly Building at Canaveral.  The Lang rocket is a multi-stage setup just like later versions which would take Americans to the moon, but it seems only about half as large as the Saturn V rocket.  It mostly resembles a large version of the German V-2 rocket--not surprising, considering the source.  Interestingly, when the rocket reaches the launch ""pad"", it's lowered into a deep pool of water, to give the whole thing stability once the gantries are removed.  So, when the rocket finally blasts off, it emerges from the water looking almost exactly like a Polaris missile launch of the sixties!  Others have been impressed by the fact that this was the first time a takeoff used the now famous ""10-9-8-7-6...."" countdown to ignition, but this seems a rather small thing to me.

Of course, there are number of sci-fi ""laffers"" in this early silent effort.  Perhaps the most egregious are 1) the depiction of zero-g, and 2) the presence of a moon ""atmosphere"".  The movie shows only a brief zero-g point in space halfway between the earth and the moon, where the gravitational fields of the two celestial bodies ""cancel each other out"".  Even most astrophysicists of the time would have known this to be false.  And a moon ""atmosphere"" seems equally if not more ridiculous, but we'll allow Lang this dramatic liberty.  In addition, you may have to resist the temptation to guffaw at the ""instrumentation"" inside the capsule..... but on the other hand note that the rocket is powered by some sort of liquified gas (liquid oxygen?), as in modern times.

Fans of sci-fi:  please put up with the stupid plot and often-hammy silent film acting.  When you watch both this film and Fritz Lang's great movie of two years before--""Metropolis""--you'll understand why he must be accorded the title of Father of the Sci-fi film genre(with all due respect to Georges Melies).",1376006400,,2604,4.8929384965831435
2165563,4,B00064AEXI,"Woman in the Moon is less ambitious in scope than Lang's previous sci-fi film Metropolis. It has a much smaller cast and smaller sets, and the score consists largely of beautiful piano melodies as opposed to the full orchestra of Lang's previous science fiction film. Fortunately, the story is strong, and less campy than Metropolis (no android belly-dancers here). I like the characters, particularly Helius and his steely resolve during the climax (too bad Wendigger ends up being a spiteful, cowardly tool). Also, the film quality, while a bit grainy, is consistent throughout.

Also worth mentioning is the attention to detail the film makers committed to when they shot this. Lang and von Harbou managed to pull off a relatively feasible flight to the moon involving a two-stage rocket forty years before it actually happened. The story uses details such as the G-forces during lift off, the necessary conservation of oxygen, and the use of thrusters to counter gravitational forces. Yes, there are many scientific inaccuracies in the film, but it's impressive how many things they got right.

At the end of the day, I think I still prefer Metropolis because of its grandeur. However, I really like Woman in the Moon as well. It is another cinema classic from a stellar husband and wife duo.",1372636800,2,1296,4.99537037037037

But what surprised me was how much I enjoyed Fritz Lang's telling of the story.  It unfolds much more slowly than a typical Hollywood movie today, but I enjoyed how he took his time to let us know the characters.  When it became time to move the rocket out of its assembly building to the launch area, this took place slowly -- almost as if it were in real time -- and was all the more powerful because of it.  The background music is okay, but is rather simplistic.

(Note: The only reason I wanted to give this film the extra half star is for its excellent production values.)

I read about this film for years mostly as a result of my research into Fritz Lang and ""Metropolis"" and have seen the most commonly used stills from it (the nose cone on the moon with two explores without pressure suits standing in front of it) in every SF film book I own.  I have to confess I was really disapointed in the film.  I found the film to be over long and slow moving.

Little of the crazy energy that made ""Metropolis"" so engaging can be found here.  The plot is nowhere as strong as the plots of Lang's ""M"", the Ring films or the ones in the Dr. Mabuse films.  The love triangle that takes up most of the film's running time fails to hold one's attention nor does the story of the building of the rocket ship itself.  The stuff about international spies (who appear to be Americans) seems to slow things down even more.

The film does begin to pick up steam with the lead up to the actual launch and the launch itself is quite good.  I am told that the count down was invented for this film for dramatic effect.  But once our heroes land on the moon events are so silly that the rest of the film boggs down again.

On the plus side the film does have some really great sets.  The model and set used for the space ship launch is quite good.  A launch from water is really original.  The mock up of the space ship nose cone and the surrounding moonscape are also well made.  Yet these pluses do very little to make up for how actually boring the film really is.",1365552000,5,1794,4.129682997118156
2165569,5,B00064AEXI,"This is the second of great silent SF movies made by Fritz Lang and although not as immensely great and universaly known as ""Metropolis"", it is certainly a very major film! Below, you will find some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

""Frau im Mond"" begins with the great dream of a manned expedition to the Moon shared by two unlikely friends. One of them, professor Georg Mannfeldt (Klaus Pohl), is an old scientist, considered by his pairs as a madman or a fraud and living in most abject poverty. The second, Wolf Helius (Willy Fritsch), is a gifted engineer and very succesful businessman, owner of a major industrial company. Together they decide to build a giant rocket and go to the Moon, looking for gold which they hope will cover the immense cost of this enterprise. This is described in the very beginning of the film. The performance of Klaus Pohl as an old half-mad scientist is absolutely unique - those first minutes of the film, you really WANT to see them!

What happens next? Well, quite a lot indeed, because this is a long film. Some sinister forces will intervene, acting through The Man, a nameless archi-villain played magistrally by actor Fritz Rasp, who with his unique physionomy and great talent steals absolutely every scene he appears in (he also played a quite sinister character in ""Metropolis""). As the title clearly suggests, a young woman will also play a considerable role - this is in fact one of the first films in which a woman who is also a serious scientist appears... There will be a love triangle, lots of trouble during the space trip, more trouble on the Moon and a very good, VERY surprising ending. All of this under the curious but stoic regard of a very zen mouse, played by Die Maus Josephine (as stated in the credits)...)))

This is a long film, but I didn't feel the time passing. The performance of actors is absolutely brilliant! The unique character of talent needed to act in silent movies gives to this film a charm impossible to find in modern cinema. Passion, hope, love, despair, anger, cruelty, lust, terror, disgust, ecstasy - you name it, they are all here, silently screaming at us from the screen. The plot is not bad at all, especially considering that this film is a pioneering work. Description of space travel is of course deliciously silly, but that also gives this film a very unique savour.

This film is also the first one to show the countdown to the launch of a rocket - pretty impressive, considering that this film was made in 1929. The very solemn moment of launching of the rocket is a great and very emotional cinema scene - and it certainly greatly impressed and inspired many young students, who were later to become rocket scientists in German V-1 and V-2 program in Peenemunde, beginning with a certain Werner von Braun, who saw this film, eyes wide-open, at the tender age of 17. In fact, the first V-2 rocket ever launched had the image of ""Frau im Mond"" painted on it...

I loved this film greatly and I am absolutely keeping preciously this DVD. I recommend it with all my heart. Enjoy!",1365120000,,3092,4.655677655677656

2165571,4,B00064AEXI,"I remember seeing stills from Frau im Mond in one of Forrest J. Ackerman's movie magazines in the early 60s and longing to watch the actual film. When I realized that dream I was a little surprised but ultimately satisfied by the experience. This release by Kino presents it in a nice print, with marvelous titles and a delightful and evocative original score. The three-star reviewer from 09/04/12 got it pretty much correct, though I'm giving the film one more star. A lot of time is wasted in the first third of the film on the tedious development of an extortion plot that eventually serves to create tension once we get to the Moon itself. Moreover, although there is a love triangle that also is meant to complicate matters, the real nature of the triangle is never all that clear: Though the hero is secretly in love with his friend's fiancee, so much so that his facial contortions become a distraction, her real feelings always seem confused -- though appearing to long for the hero, she remains devoted to her current boyfriend, who becomes increasingly less desirable as the story progresses. In any case, the immediate launch preparations are perhaps the focus of the entire film, and it's remarkable how closely that compelling build-up presages the real event forty years later -- the launch vehicle slowly hauled out of its assembly building, the massive crowds watching from grandstands. The launch itself is puny compared to the countdown itself, but the scenes on the Moon itself are truly majestic for their time. The plot, however, quickly devolves into ridiculous melodrama. With a better and tighter story -- and more accurate depiction of some aspects -- this film could have rivaled Metropolis in some ways. As it is, the movie is visually enjoyable all the time and positively overwhelming some of the time, and it's those enthralling moments that make this film a worthwhile experience in the end.",1357776000,,1923,4.901840490797546
2165572,3,B00064AEXI,"Worst things first. Despite being made by Fritz Lang and his then-wife and screenwriter Thea von Harbou only two years later, Frau im Mond aka Woman in the Moon is no Metropolis. It's as if Kubrick had followed 2001 with Destination Moon - a capable enough picture, but one for its day rather than for the ages. Even had it not been banned by the Nazis in 1937 because its depiction of rocket science was deemed too close to their secret rocket programme it probably would have been forgotten of its own accord. There's no grand vision, no striking design, only one real set piece and almost nothing to say. Made purely to cash in on the rocket craze that hit Germany in the late 20s and Fritz Lang's own enthusiasm for Hermann Oberth's pioneering theoretical work, the main attraction of `the first science fiction film based on scientific fact' is its visionary and surprisingly accurate (in parts) depiction of interplanetary rocket travel. Unfortunately to get to that you have to put up with a drawn out 74 minutes of melodrama, and once it reaches the Moon it waves goodbye to science and says hello again to melodrama.

The opening hour and a quarter is the biggest problem, padding the length out and taking its own sweet time setting up characters and plot points that could have been done in less than a third of the time. Heartbroken over the woman he loves, Friede (Gerda Maurus), deciding to marry his best friend Windegger (Gustav von Wagenheim), wealthy Wolf Helius (Willy Fritsch) finally decides to make the trip to the Moon in the rocket he's designing, spurred on more by emptiness than by the theories of the ridiculed and ruined Professor Manfeldt (Klaus Pohl) that the mountains of the Moon are rich in gold. But an international consortium of gold producers aren't quite so blas, stealing his papers and research material and threatening to destroy his rocket and kill his workers if he doesn't agree to give them the monopoly on the Moon's gold reserves because ""I for one want the moon's riches, should they actually prove to exist, to fall into the hands of businessmen, and not visionaries and idealists."" Which, along with the appearance of their sinister agent Fritz Rasp, looking like Crispin Glover playing Adolf Hitler only even creepier, should provide some dramatic conflict other than Fritsch losing his girl to his best friend, but unfortunately it's all but forgotten as soon as all three of them agree to his demands.

Thankfully, while never especially dull, the picture really picks up at this point as it gets out of the apartments and drawing rooms and onto the impressively realised launch pad and the trip to the Moon itself. Here at last Lang brings some sense of epic scale to the picture, aided by some surprisingly decent model effects. While it gets a lot wrong, it's true to the best science of the day and probably gets even more right, presenting a credible multi-stage rocket and a decent attempt to realistically depict both the effects of G-force and weightlessness (Lang's cost-effective solution to the latter is quite ingenious). It even introduces many of the staples off later sci-fi films, like watching the Earth eclipse the sun or the Earth set behind the Moon. Some of it certainly has that quaint period feel: they wear cardigans and mountaineering gear in the ship, a diving suit on the surface of the Moon before they discover it has breathable atmosphere and use a divining rod to source water. The film isn't altogether unaware of this, however. When they discover a young stowaway, he shows them his own extensive research into space travel - science fiction comic books. Once they reach the Moon, it's back to melodrama as everyone shows their true colours and, after a shootout with the obligatory crewman who goes mad, there's not enough oxygen for all of them to get back to Earth...

The film's biggest problem is that there's just not enough going on, either emotionally or intellectually, to justify its two-and-three-quarter-hours running time. It never bores and it is fascinating seeing what it got right and what it got wrong, but it just doesn't pay off big enough for that kind of investment. It's hard to avoid the feeling that you could jettison those first 74 minutes and not feel much loss, not least because it's so hard to care about the characters. Maurus, looking like Margaret Dumont's younger, svelter and much more attractive younger sister, is an idealised figure of German womanhood who proves the most noble character, but she's too idealised to ever come alive. Fritsch, the first man to record Lili Marlene, is a right old misery guts as the hero, spending so much of the film scowling, wincing, staring off into the distance or trimming a neighbour's plant to the roots that instead of wanting them to get together you start to long for her to try to slap him out of his insufferable self pity.

Although an mprovement on Kino's US release, Eureka's Masters of Cinema UK DVD release is a mixture of the excellent and the frustrating. The restored print is outstanding, but the subtitling is problematic: because it uses the original German subtitles, the optional English translations have to fit in the gaps between the lines, making them difficult to read at times. Worse, the film has one of the worst layer changes of any DVD release, placed during the shot of the rocket launching, resulting in a very unwelcome freeze frame at exactly the moment when speed is of the essence (it's not as if there aren't plenty of static shots in the film where it would be less noticeable). On the plus side, Gabriele Jacobi's short documentary packs a lot of information into its 14 minutes, not only comparing the film's space travel scenes to real NASA footage of the first Moon landing but also detailing how, as a publicity stunt for the film, UFA's publicity department provided the funding for Hermann Oberth to move from the theoretical to practical experiments with the first liquid fuel rocket (at least until the publicity budget ran out). Ironically, instead of the rocket research publicising the film, the film publicised rocket research, with one of Oberth's assistants, Werner von Braun, even using a woman on the Moon as the emblem for the V2 rocket. There's also the customary booklet.",1346716800,3,6293,4.834879406307977
2165573,4,B00064AEXI,"200 minutes that pass like the wind. Fritz Lang doesn't use travellings but he sure does know how to fill the frame of his shots. I particularly liked the man who manages to change his face thanks to an ultra quick massage/movement (maybe an allusion to Hitler and his double face, I don't know) and the golf trousers of the heroin ready to embark to the moon. Highly recommended.",1323043200,,380,4.521739130434782
2165574,5,B00064AEXI,"Woman in the Moon is a film I've dreamed of seeing for nearly fifty years. Finally! I get to watch it. This King Video version is outstanding in the crisp clarity of its imagery. Thrilled to drink in every detail. Plus, I love Fritz Lang films. I had read the science was poor, that weightlessness was ignored and the moon portrayed with an atmosphere. Not exactly. The pull of the Earth and Moon are portrayed as exerting 'gravity' throughout, but there's a brief portion of the trip where the two 'cancel each other out' and the resulting weightlessness is well portrayed, if briefly. And only certain low areas on the far side are portrayed as possessing a breathable atmosphere, reflecting certain theories of the day. The science is accurate for the time. The lunarscape is beautiful. Where the film falls down is the long, rather contrived attempt to blackmail the builder of the rocketship into converting a scientific expedition into a search for gold presumed to be in abundance in the lunar rocks. That plus a love triangle involving a married couple and the builder convert the film into something of an outrageous soap opera. For all that, still the best depiction of launch preparations and space travel till the 1950s. If you are serious about collecting the significent films in the SF genre, you've got to have this in your collection. It's a true classic.",1306454400,,1372,4.817796610169491
2165575,3,B00064AEXI,"This reminded me of spaceflight films from the 1950s. All the ingredients are there. A homemade spaceship with room for standing, cabinets with dials and levers, a few men -- including one sage one, and one evil -- and a woman. And (oh!) a young stowaway.

But this was made over 20 years earlier. B&W. No sound. Heavy melodramatic plot and acting.

And it goes on for 2 hours and 48 minutes, developing at a very slow pace. Too slow for most of today's audiences. But I was fairly engrossed. Director Fritz Lang was a master of his style of storytelling and filmmaking.

Good points are the efforts at scientific accuracy -- it was surprisingly prescient at times, supremely silly at others. The direction and cinematography were topnotch, too.

It was a bit distracting that the villain was made to look like Adoph Hitler. Lang was staunchly anti-Nazi and left Germany around 1933.",1299542400,3,883,4.751633986928105
2165576,5,B00064AEXI,"Okay, first off:  the interesting trivia on this movie:

When the Germans did their first rocket launch at Pennemunde their missile had the woman on the moon logo on it.

Thereafter, the countdown device used in this movie (four, three, two, one) was actually used in rocket launches including American space missions.

As for the movie itself, it would be THE template for space movies throughout at least the 50s in the several following respects:

It's depiction of what space rockets would look like.

It's presentation of the likely crew compliment (including usually some rugged looking leader type guy, a love interest for him some bearded science type and of course some plucky side kick).

At the time of course none of these ingredients was a given.  And it took the sure directorial hand of Fritz Lang aided of course by his then wife Thea von Harbou to create this masterpiece.

I think this film does rank up there as one of the great science fiction movies of all time including Georges Melies Journey to the Moon and Stanley Kubrick's later 2001.  But of course it's a movie -- like pretty much all of Lang's 1920s output -- that inspires sheer wonder at its breathtaking ambition and its ability to carry through on its promises.",1295913600,2,1245,4.748837209302326
2165577,4,B00064AEXI,"The many reviews already listed touch upon most of the salient aspects of this masterpiece. But I would like to underline what a previous (3-star rating) reviewer pointed out. The launch sequence has to be considered one of the most powerful, riveting, and exhilarating sequences in the history of film. This is so from both an artistic and intellectual perspective. The gradual, extended, relentless buildup to the actual launch has an epic quality which is perhaps unmatched in science fiction films, and which manages to convey--through the imaginative force of its artistry--the strangeness and wonder of the event almost more vividly than what we experienced at the time of the actual moon landing just four decades after the film was made. This creative leap of the imagination is all that science fiction can hope to be--as the opening motto states: 'Never' does not exist for the human mind...only 'Not Yet.'",1292112000,,916,5.113333333333333
2165578,4,B00064AEXI,"The Netflix version I watched had clean black cards with white printed lettering rather than the original cards.  Still, the movie started out pretty well.

Fritz Lang, the German impressionist silent film maker had created his famous Metropolis in 1927.  In 1929, on the advice of his wife, had created Women In The Moon.  Despite the cheesy title, it really had some good things going for it.

I read in other sources that real-life Professor Hermann Oberth, who later worked on the Nazi V-2 and, still later, for George Pal on  Destination Moon, provided technical input.

The story basically goes like this:

We have a speaker in a lecture hall, the scientist Manfeldt, and everyone there is laughing like crazy, I mean belly laughs!  This guy claims that there are mountains of gold on the moon and that soon we will be able to fly a manned rocket to the moon.  Gales of laughter ensue!

He gets angry and tells them off to no avail.

Many years later, the professor is an old broken man.  Even so, he manages with the help of a few friends, to put together some wealthy backers for the first Moon trip.

These backers seem very interested in the Moon's gold deposits that they suspect are there.  When they snatch it, ""we will control Earth's gold.""  Wow!  Lang really plays up on greed and corporate chicanery in this film.

Also fascinating is that Lang's research into space exploration and rocketry shows us plans, models and designs that are quite frankly astounding.  A three stage rocket was not heard of before this, at least on film.

And the photographs and model drawings of unmanned rockets being shot to the Moon was quite realistic by today's standards.  This is the film's strong point, the research, the three stage rocket, the countdown before blast-off and everything we today have come to expect and take for granted.  This was revolutionary stuff!

After much arguing, the guys all get together to take off.  Someone skywrites in the air the start date of countdown.  Cute!

The rocket being rolled out from its building to the launching stage was very prophetic.  Placing it in water was not, but that's fine.  The illusion of large size with shadows and searchlights is great, as are the crowd scenes and the continual arguments among these astronauts.  For example, Helius tries to beg Friede not to go on this trip.  Apparently (and this later becomes the case) that he has a crush on her.  He begs to her right in front of her fianc too.  Dork.  She demands that is he saying a woman is not as brave as they are to venture forth?  Doesn't he know "" the eyes of the world"" are upon them?  That buttons his lip and they're off!

Yeah, melodramatic at times.  Critics blame Fritz Lang's wife for the love triangles, jealousy and other trifles that pepper this otherwise surprisingly well made story of space travel, complete with rockets and adventure.

When they get to the Moon and they have breathable air, well that was completely wrong.  And a boy is a stowaway aboard, and considers he has studied the Moon problem because of his stack of comic books!  Suspension of disbelief.  I like the shoe straps on the floor and the straps on teh ceiling in case of anti-gravity.  They thought of all kinds of problems in space.  Everyone wears bulky sweaters or a suit and tie, however.

Interesting special effects of brandy floating in the air and catching it in a shot glass.  Sehr gut!

Plot holes abound (how is there gold on the moon, anyway?) but quibbles aside, a historical film, and historically important to the world of cinema.  Recommended!

2165579,4,B00064AEXI,"This Fritz Lang film was of great interest to me because it includes two actors I would seek out movies just to see them in based on their work in other films: Fritz Rasp, who I was very impressed by his performance in ""Warning Shadows"" (he was also in ""Metropolis""), and Gustav von Wangenheim who was also in ""Warning Shadows"" and is forever immortalized as Hutter in the Murnau classic ""Nosferatu.""  ""Frau Im Mond"" also seemed intriguing because it was a late silent (1929--when technology had evolved quite a bit from the early days) with a science fiction theme.  How did imaginations view space travel and the moon 40 years before the moon landing?  You'll find out here.

First off, this film is LONG.  It's over 2 1/2 hours and, as interesting the storyline and as visually appealing as it was, I couldn't watch the whole thing in one sitting.  It dragged the first time I watch it but, the second time (also in two blocks) I enjoyed it a lot more.  Here's the basic premise of the story without giving away any spoilers:  Head of Helius Flight Hangars, Wolf Helius, (played by Willy Fritsch whose serious look and demeanor reminds me of Richard Barthelmess) visits professor Manfeldt who has just thrown out a man named Turner who wanted a manuscript (the lifelong work of Manfeldt's) as a curiosity.  Played by a 45 year old Klaus Pohl, Manfeldt is made to look like a disheveled old man starving in a hovel.  Decades earlier he was laughed out of his profession when he publicly announced his treatise that there is gold on the moon.  Helius decides he wants to go to the moon to test Manfeldt's theory, so the professor entrusts the manuscript with him.

Meanwhile, as a side issue, Helius finds out his chief engineer, Hans Windegger (Wangenheim), has become engaged to a student of astronomy, Friede Velten.  Foreshadowing that this union might be less than perfect, the engagement ring was too big for even her thumb; what was he thinking? Although Friede means ""Peace"" in German, she is the center of some tension as Helius is also in love with her and Friede's thoughts seem often preoccupied with Helius even though she accepted the marriage proposal from the impulsive, intense Windegger.

Back to the matter at hand: Turner, who turns out to be quite the master of disguise--gets his hands on the manuscript as well as a spaceship model, plans, film and photos taken from an H32 rocket of the opposite side of the moon from Helius's safe.  Turner, it turns out, is working for a powerful group of four business men and a woman who smokes a cigar who want control of the moon gold.  Turner blackmails Helius into giving him a seat on the ship.

The setting throughout the film is very cool from the super high doors in Helius's apartment complex to the elaborate launch with the frantic crowds, announcer, and huge rocket ship and launching pad not to mention the moon scenes.  There are behind-the-scenes photos showing the making of these sets as a bonus feature on this disc and they are very impressive.  I can't imagine how much money and people it took to create them.  The launch was very creative as the ship was submerged in water because it was so light.  There is also a countdown to launch and off goes the spaceship with Helius, Windegger, Friede, Turner, Manfeldt and his pet mouse Josephine as well as a stowaway they won't find until later. The ship itself has straps throughout the interior for the astronauts to step in during zero gravity (strangely, their hair stays in place).  The effects on space travel on the astronauts' bodies (in casual clothes--I guess they could save money on space suits) are dramatic. Turner has a particularly wrenching time. Once on the moon, what will they find?  I won't give it away but finding gold may be the least of their worries.

The acting is, for the most part, excellent.  Wangenheim (who is known for being a bit overly dramatic in ""Nosferatu"") doesn't disappoint here.  He really lets the emotions fly.  Rasp, who had an evil streak in ""Warning Shadows,"" is freaky evil in this film.  He dresses like a Fascist and even sports a Hitler haircut!  Hitler hadn't even become Chancellor yet!  Crazy!  (Note:  Wangenheim was a devoted Communist and very anti-Nazi and would defect to the Soviet Union when Hitler came to power).  Gerde Maurus (who played Friede) had a subtle style which worked well for her character who, emotionally, proves the strongest of them all.  All the main actors and director Lang had long careers and, save for Maurus, lived well past middle age.  Most lived to see the actual moon landing.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is worth the time to see the amazing sets, intriguing storyline, and some people's views on space travel when it was still only the subject of fiction.",1242777600,5,4784,4.706730769230769
2165580,5,B00064AEXI,"Made at the artistic pinnacle and end of the silent era in 1929, this beautiful film is gripping, stunning and very surprising for the nearly three hours of its duration, and as thus, perhaps also the high point of Fritz Lang's career.  After his success with the now classic Sci-Fi drama ""Metropolis"" a few years earlier, Lang once again collaborated with screenwriter (and wife at that time) Thea von Harbou, to produce another outstanding creation, this time including elements of his other successful films with themes of espionage and intrigue.  The result is a very smooth-flowing, captivating and engrossing story which borders on reality and fantasy.  Conceived some decades before rocket and space travel technology, the scenes depicting the trip to the moon are at times amusingly simplistic but other times remarkably close to reality and very impressive.  Yet even in its simplicity there is elegance and style, and the viewer is reminded that this is a highly artistic silent film.  Attention has been given not just to the sets but also the characters and their relationships to one another which build to a climax near the film's end.  Fritz Lang was able to draw out the emotions and ideas which drive a person, and this is superbly done in the main characters:  the ostracized professor whose ideas about finding precious metals on the moon are ridiculed, the two friends planning a moon trip and their love triangle with a fellow female astronaut, as well as the ever-intriguing agent of evil played by Fritz Rasp who excels in such roles.  With Germany's best cast and crew on hand, ""Woman in the Moon"" should be better known than it is, but its excellence is subtle somehow, and seems to reveal itself more each time you view it.  And viewing is certainly a pleasure, with absolutely perfect picture quality in pristine black and white, accompanied by a most suitable piano and orchestral score.  This film is more than just an outstanding example of early Science Fiction; it is a work of art in Lang's own style and apart from the light-and-shadow Expressionist style used frequently by his German colleagues.  There is much light and brightness in this film which suits the mood of boldly going where no man - or woman - has gone before, and it leaves the viewer with a positive and satisfied feeling.",1220140800,5,2324,4.873096446700508
2165581,4,B00064AEXI,"I decided to buy this DVD after seeing the rocket launching sequence on television's `Classic Arts Showcase'. I was amazed that the quality of the miniatures and full-size mockups seemed so far advanced for the year of filming. This is a long film by any standards and must have seemed even longer to audiences viewing this almost eighty years ago. We take for granted that space shuttles are assembled in a large building and are rolled out to their launch site, but we can only imagine what their minds made of this at a time when people were only starting to take to the skies in the most primitive of aircraft. I find it amazing that so many of the movie techniques and clich&eacute;s that, perhaps, we now criticize for their lack of originality; first saw their use in this film.

I agree that the film could do with a little judicious editing, but the quality of the film together with the excellent music accompaniment make its purchase an obvious choice for any movie buff, especially one interested in science fiction.",1218499200,2,1028,4.679558011049724

Top writers and top director and UFA studios can only produce a masterpiece.
