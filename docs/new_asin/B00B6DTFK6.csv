5559636,5,B00B6DTFK6,"The year is 1966. Kaoru Nishimi has recently moved to Kyuushu to live with relatives. He has spent most of his life transferring schools, so he knows there is little to look forward to at this new one.  The fact that he must climb a long sloping hill to school every morning is just rubbing salt on the wound. But when he meets Sentaro Kawabuchi, Kaoru learns about the magic of jazz and the joy of real friendships. With Sentaro and Ritsuko by his side, the hill to school becomes easier to climb.

I think the greatest thing about this show was the characters. They seemed like real people; ones you could emphasize with, feel sympathy for, and cheer at their efforts. The characters in this show were probably some of the most human characters I've seen in anime. Both Kaoru and Sentaro grow and change over the course of the series through their friendship with each other. Ritsuko is probably the least developed character, but she grew on me.

Part of what made the characters great was their expression and bonding through music. I've never been a fan of jazz, with my opinion of it towards the negative end of the neutral scale, but I really enjoyed the music in this show. I still can't say I am a jazz listener, but my appreciation of the style has gone way up. The music not only gave great dimension to the characters, but it was also very well done. The jazz sessions were some of the best scenes in the show.

I didn't really have an expectations when I started this series. But what I found was far more than I could have hoped for. This is a show about the friendship between three people. They sometimes fight. Sometimes they do stupid things and hurt each other. But mostly they help each other find the courage to do what it is they couldn't do alone. Over the course of the 3 years of high school, and sometime after that, their friendship helps them to grow.

Kids on the Slope is a 12 episode anime based on a 9 volume manga. The ending is nicely tied up and it is unlikely to have any sequels.",1360281600,19,2016,4.379679144385027

5559646,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Directed by Shinichir Watanabe and with music by Yoko Kanno who last worked together on Cowboy Bebop, this is a short but powerful coming of age story centered around 3 friends set in historical 1960s Japan, with a powerful (jazz) musical theme throughout. I can't recommend this series enough.  Great music, great characters, great writing, well executed plotlines, tone is appropriate and well managed.  Overall top notch anime.",1467244800,2,430,5.3088235294117645
5559647,3,B00B6DTFK6,"Its not easy being the new kid, trying to fit in somewhere new even as you're still trying to figure out who you are. Its even harder if youve always been a bit sheltered, slow to make friends, if youve never found it easy to open up to people. And maybe its hardest of all if you find yourself transplanted from the noisy, crowded bustle of Tokyo to a quiet, backwater town in rural Kyushu, Japans southernmost island.

Thats what happens to Kaoru Nishimi, a studious but emotionally isolated teen whos sent to live with his aunt in Kyushu just as hes starting high school. It seems he might never make any friends, except for one thing: he plays the piano. Hes trained in classical music, but he falls in with a couple of fellow students who love jazz, and slowly they teach him to love it, too. The story of their unlikely friendship is the foundation of Shinichiro Watanabes anime series ""Kids on the Slope.""

""Kids"" has a lot of really promising elements. The cast, even Kaoru, are likeable from the get-go, people you want to root for and enjoy spending time with. The story is down-to-earth and easy to relate to even if the far reaches of Kyushu are completely unfamiliar to you. And the musicoh, the music. Its one thing to write a manga about some talented young musicians (""Kids"" is based on such a manga). The audience can make up the music in their heads and it can sound as good as it needs to. But what do you do when you're translating that into a TV show, where the characters claims have to be substantiated by actual music? Well, if you're ""Kids on the Slope,"" you get Yoko Kanno, the incomparable composer for shows like ""Cowboy BeBop"" and ""Wolfs Rain."" Her score for ""Kids"" goes above and beyond even her usual excellence, bringing infectious rhythms and a real joy in music to jazz standards as well as some surprise tunes.

The problem is that the series never quite puts these pieces to best use. The characters hardly seem to grow or develop; instead, they're caught in an endless loop of will they-wont they, do they-dont they, its-not-what-it-looks-like, and other romantic-drama clich&eacute;s from which they never seem to learn anything. Given how likeable the characters are, this is especially frustrating; we *want* these people to succeed and be happy together. That the show rarely allows them this chance, for what come across as arbitrary reasons of poor writing, is a disappointment.

In my view, the failure to develop the characters largely cripples ""Kids on the Slope."" It causes a strong premise and enjoyable cast to go to waste. Yoko Kannos score is so transcendently good that it almost single-handedly redeems the series, but then again, maybe you could just import the soundtrack CD.

At first I was expecting an anime similar to BECK where the characters form a band and try to make it big, but instead I got a beautiful story about adolescence, love, heartbreak, and of course, jazz. I did think the show was a little weepy and dramatic sometimes, but it was effective, cuz I had to fight back some tears at certain points.

5559678,5,B00B6DTFK6,"With so many forms of entertainment centered around music, it's really hard to find a show centered around Jazz, let alone young students who are dealing with friendship, love and torn up families with jazz working to fix those issues. The show really makes you care about the characters, and the music doesn't just accompany scenes. They stand out, enhance the characters and their passion for jazz. Several times I ended up looking up all of the songs because the show really made appreciate it.

The art is gorgeous as is the animation. Being a Sentai dub...it's really bad, because well, Sentai dubs are not the best. I am not one to dismiss a dub if there is an option for one, but it was really bad. The Japanese track was perfect for the show.

I don't understand why the menu didn't have any music to accompany it. The whole thing is a simple, plain presentation, which is a real shame because I adored this show. It deserves a lot more than what it got. Some might not like this show because the characters are all really damaged and are dealing with loss, broken families, the desire to fit in and find people that will care about them. Some say the show is too ""angsty"" but to be honest, I thought the angst was handled really well. And it really developed the characters. At the end of the day, you can relate to everything these characters are going through, and how the passions they hold can get them through everything.

The show left me with a warm feeling, and wanting more of the short time we were given to spend time with the characters. Everyone should give this a try.",1419638400,,1591,4.479310344827586
5559679,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Great story set in the 1960s with a soundtrack the evokes the kind of things I heard my parents play while growing up  in the 1980s.  One of the rare shows that transcends its genre. This isn't great anime, it is a great show period.",1403654400,,233,4.155555555555556
5559680,3,B00B6DTFK6,"Pros: Jazz is awesome.  I came into the series liking Jazz music, so I wasn't disappointed with the music.  Plenty of melodrama to go around, which works for a show that takes massive jumps ahead in time per episode (most episodes are of a single season of time in the kids lives).  Not afraid of the darker themes that accompany musicianship (that's all I'll say without giving it away.)  The series is still good, it's just not what you would compare to Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo, because doing that is unfair to the show... it's a coming-of-age period drama from the 1960's.  It is well done, but it has only one thing in common with the other two: it has great music.  The visuals are also well done, and leaves one reminiscing of what a childhood would be like in that time... even if I wasn't born yet.

Cons: The main character of the show isn't who he appears at the beginning, and that is echoed throughout the finale.  This is an ensemble cast, so if you don't put too much weight behind the main character, you'll enjoy the series more.  I didn't, and I disliked the ending... I didn't like what Kaoru turned out to be, and that's all I'll say.  While the series focuses on the events of Kaoru, Sentaro, and Ritsuko, not much is behind Yurika (the girl in the hat on the cover) which leaves her character less-well-developed and I ended up dismissing her plotline (probably unfairly).  The jazz music is all standards and there is no original work, so if you're looking for the next great Yoko Kanno soundtrack of new material (Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus and Ghost In The Shell:SAC being among my all time favorites), it's not here.  Playing all of the soundtracks from the original musicians on Spotify is just as satisfying, but that means that Kanno did her job well.",1397088000,,1788,4.553125
5559681,3,B00B6DTFK6,"Kids on the Slope is a coming of age story by the same team behind anime classic cowboy bebop. The story focuses on the friendship between Kaoru and Sentaro. Kaoru is a bookish nerdy guy new to school who meets rough streetwise Sentaro. While the the two couldn't be anymore different they form a bond over jazz music. Set in 1966 Japan the anime is filled with musical references to not just jazz but pop music (the Beatles for example) that was current for the time.

The anime reminded me a lot of John Knowles ""a separate peace"" where Kaoru's character has some paranoia and jealousy about the relationships around him. Over the course of the series we see their friendship tested over girls, music and social pressure.

My only real complaint was the English dub. While the main characters are good the portrayal of supporting character Seiji is offensive. The character is artsy. In the English dub Sentai has decided to depict him as a gay stereotype completed with lisp, high pitched and overly effeminate voice all while uttering things like ""fabulous"" and ""fierce"". This type of performance is no more acceptable than old cartoons that depicted Asian characters with heavy accents saying ""you want much tasty fried lice?"". I watched the Japanese language track to compare performances. Seiji while still shy and effeminate is not the imitation of South Park's big gay Al that is found in the English dub.

Overall this is a great show and I still recommend it. Just watch the Japanese track.",1396656000,10,1501,4.810077519379845
5559682,4,B00B6DTFK6,"This is a great series for Jazz fans. The makers of this series really understand the nature of rhythm in Jazz and the performance arrangements of old standards are, in my opinion, even better and more energetic than the originals.

The story has a lot of the typical unrequited love triangle drama going on underneath the high points, which are the performances.

There is an extra feature on the menu, about the making of the series. Yohko Kanno is interviewed and a lot is explained about how they selected amateur (but talented) musicians who play at a near professional level, and how she studied 1960s recording methods so that she could replicate the kind of performance that talented high school musicians could do at their very best. One interesting and shocking revelation came out in one of the interviews with Ms. Kanno: she doesn't particularly like Jazz! Ironic, given that her name is associated with many of the better Jazz-oriented anime soundtracks from Japan. That certainly has not had a negative effect on the arrangements and performances! They are exciting, energizing and make the hairs on the back of one's next rise.

The story line is pretty typical love triangle type stuff, though the characters have some very unique pasts and as we become aware of some of the revelations about them, their particular quirks become understandable. Some of it reveals almost shocking attitudes held by some Japanese soon after the war ended. A lot of bitterness remained by 1966, so the growing up period of these kids experienced some strong Japanese nationalism, which made life hard for one of the characters, whom it was revealed is Japanese-American.

Sonically, the 1966 recording methods that Ms. Kanno employed tend to rob the performances of some of the ""you are there"" sparkle. The sound is darker and somewhat compressed on the Blu-ray video than other of Ms. Kanno's work on other series. But the performances are inspiring, especially the reunion performance with the Hammond B3 in the church.

The animation was amazing. They used up to eleven cameras to capture the musicians' performances and then rotoscoped the animation to fit precisely the movements of the real musicians. That's why when you watch them performing, the movement looks like a live action movie and the sound matches perfectly.

Anyone who loves Jazz will probably enjoy this series, immensely. There is so much that's educational about the path of a Classically-trained pianist, making his transition into understanding the unique swing of Jazz, that makes the series so uniquely real. As a recording engineer who's worked with some of America's Jazz legends in the past, I've become aware of certain subtle nuances of Jazz performance, and these nuances are in Kids on the Slope. This is serious music and this series does it justice, with icing on top of the cake.",1393804800,,2865,5.008403361344538
5559683,5,B00B6DTFK6,"I am an anime enthusiast and have been watching anime for as long as I can remember.  Kids on the Slope is one most memorable series I have ever watched.  In fact, I watched it from start to finish in one day.  It is simply THAT good.  I hate giving out spoilers, and simply, this is a beautiful story about friendship through music.  I'm not even a jazz fan and I still play this soundtrack months after I watched this series.  Please watch, it's really worth it.",1393200000,,464,4.275862068965517

One of the most enjoyable series I've watch in a while!  I'm kind of disappointed it's only a short 12-episode season.  I wanted more.  I was really invested in this series and I feel it really could have been made into at least 24 episodes.  Also, I'm slightly disappointed with the ending.  I'm a sucker for happy endings, and although there is somewhat of an okay resolution in the end, I wanted more!  This anime just left me wanting MORE!  But I recommend this to any anime fan.  Oh and I forgot to mention the music!  I've never even been into jazz before, but the musical aspect of this show is really great.  The absolute highlight of this series for me was probably the impromptu performance they do at the school talent show.",1392595200,,880,4.57051282051282

5559698,5,B00B6DTFK6,"This is one of the best anime series I've seen period.  I'm sure that's partly due to the fact that I am a musician that's been in and out of bands, and it resonates with that part of my life.  It's an emotional engaging drama that allows a glimpse into what it's like to connect to someone in the expression of playing music and what better way to show that than the spontaneous nature of jazz.  The only other drama I can think of that shows this off as well is the movie ""Once"" with Glen Hansard.

Everything from the animation to the impressive soundtrack was obviously done with extreme care, including the story that surrounds these lives.  Another thing I love about this, is that it's a story that you'd believe was real, not hollywoodized with candy coated stereotypes and predictable characters.  It's a story that begins and ends, not to be left open to cash in on and exploit.  Nope, this is art, a picture that's painted and finished.

This is just another example of a well made artistic drama and will sadly be unseen by a good number of people that don't understand that anime, much like graphic novels, is a vehicle for all types of storytelling.",1383350400,,1163,4.504761904761905
5559699,5,B00B6DTFK6,What not to say about this jazzy anime?  I've been a jazz baby since the day I was born.  Its been a great influence in my life and the music soothes the soul.  The anime hits the right spot and that euphoric feel that occurs when the rhythm and tone become one of true perfection.  The characters progress into more mature musicians and the overall collaboration results in a beat thats truly unforgettable.  The characters dynamic regarding their relationships to one another have a definite realism to the story for friendships/relationships are formed or shattered.  The emotional tone itself provides for a heart warming story which makes the series so much more enjoyable.,1375574400,,678,4.95575221238938

They are someone you can really relate to and they are presented as being real people in their ordinariness. They just tug at your heartstrings! It really places the music at the center of the whole show. It is what brought the characters and bonded them together. Listening to them play, you can hear how they are talking to each other through the piano and drums, it's absolutely wonderful. There is no overarching plot, no exaggeration, but it simply follows these groups of friends as they go out, beginning each day not really knowing or even thinking about what will happen. Watching their friendship grow, you will laugh and smile, maybe shed a tear or two (and then uncontrollably and pathetically sob for 20 minutes). It is truly just a one-of-a-kind beauty.",1375488000,,880,4.8344370860927155
5559701,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Kids on the Slope brings director/creator Shinichiro Watanabe and composer Yoko Kanno back together.  Previously the duo worked on Cowboy Bebop.  But don't peg this as Watanabe's usual style, this is a story set in Japan in the 1960s.  The series revolves around a close knit group of friends and their uphill struggle in life.

A few things make this story interesting, but first and foremost would be the characters.  None of the characters is your typical anime archetype.  They are unique and flawed in various ways, but in realistic and believable ways.  What each of them lack, the other seems to possess to fill a void of sorts.  The one bond that ties them all together is a love of music.

Something interesting I noted when watching the Yoko Kanno interview (which was in the disc 3 special features), Watanabe had apparently already come up with the idea for an anime series based on music.  Yoko Kanno actually sought him out again and asked if she could compose the score.

This isn't your typical anime series.  It's realistic and touching.  The only two minor drawbacks: 1) it seems like the influence of Yoko Kanno was added after the story had been framed.  Even the jazz element seems like it could have been added with any genre of popular music from the 60s (indeed there are many Beatles references).  I wonder if Watanabe had jazz in mind the whole time or perhaps had just a vague idea which was fleshed out after Kanno came on board.  Jazz isn't the central focus of the story, and the series does often go for long spans without any reference to jazz.  2) The animation quality is sometimes just average.  Which means that the Blu-Ray, while great for the sound, isn't really a big plus.  The shading was very odd and very distracting.  It was obviously a computer style shade program that left shadows with a hazy appearance, almost like the photoshop spray function.  I appreciate the effort at trying something a little different, but I still prefer the classic anime shading and shadowing effects.

Those two minor quibbles aside, the series is very good, though sadly very short.  I would have liked to get to know these kids a little more, or perhaps have a few extra episodes where they play jazz and explore life, love, and friendships.  But in the end this is a great series, and definitely worth watching.",1374883200,,2340,4.678921568627451

There is no need to do a full length synopsis: just watch it and be amazed at the story, one of friendship, growing up, coming to grip with feelings of love, and of course jazz.

5559723,5,B00B6DTFK6,"In 2007, mangaka Yuki Kodama would create a manga series titled ""Sakamichi no Apollon"" which was serialized in ""Flowers"" Magazine.

The manga series would attract the attention of director Shinichiro Watanabe (""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Samurai Champloo"", ""Baby Blue"").  Knowing that the series would feature a lot of music (especially with jazz), who best than go to a person that is well known for creating music for anime series, Yoko Kanno (""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Aquarion"", ""Macross Frontier"", ""Macross Plus"", ""Escaflowne"", ""Darker than Black"", etc.).  And in 2012, the 12-episode anime series was featured on Fuji TV's ""noitaminA"" anime block.

""Sakamichi no Apollon"" would feature a storyline written by Ayako Katoh (""Chihayafuru"", ""Stitch!: Itazura Alien no Daiboken"") and Yuuko Kakihara (""Heaven's Lost Property"", ""Stitch!"", ""Chihayafuru""), character design by Nobuteru Yuki (""Battle Angel"", ""Battle Royale High School"", ""The five Star Stories"", ""Heat Guy J"", ""Space Battleship Yamato 2199) and background art by Shinichi Uehara (""Aoi Bungaku"", ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Paprika"", ""Summer Wars"", ""Tokyo Godfathers"").

And now ""Sakamichi no Apollon"" was released in the U.S. with the title ""Kids on the Slope"" in May 2013 on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks as a complete collection.

VIDEO:

""Kids on the Slope"" features fantastic animation and background art courtesy of Mappa and Tezuka Productions!  Presented in 1080p High Definition, the series definitely captures Yuki Kodama's artwork and brings life to the anime adaptation.  Characters are well-shaded and drawn, while background art is very detailed. I love the overall look of this anime series!  No sign of softness, banding or any major issues.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

The lossless soundtrack for ""Kids on the Slope"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  While dialogue is crystal clear, how I would have loved to have a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack because of the series' wonderful music.  The music is so awesome for this series that I was hoping that it would utilize the surround channels but it's primarily a lossless stereo soundtrack, which is common for an animated television series from Japan.

As for voice acting, both the Japanese and English soundtracks are well-performed.  There is one primary difference and that is for the character of Seiji Matsuoka.  In the Japanese version, Seiji sounds like a regular teenager but for the English dub version, they made him sound very feminine and with the lisp, changed the dialogue and have him flirting with Kaoru (which is not in the Japanese version), I thought that was an interesting direction by ADR director Steven Foster to take the character of Seiji in that direction.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It's very rare to come across an anime series that captures real life and focus on character interaction, emotions and most importantly, music.

While we have seen these type of storylines featured in Japanese dramas such as ""Long Vacation"" or ""With You"", for anime there is ""Nodame no Cantabile"" but most of the time, there is always a supernatural, fantasy type of addition to that storyline.

Here we are with an anime adaptation of Yuki Kodama's ""Sakamichi no Apollon"" and having watched all 12 episodes, I can't help but feeling of how awesome, how delightful this anime series was, because it's such a rarity to see, especially to see it released in the United States.

""Kids on the Slope"" captivates the viewer for its storyline of friendship of two broken individuals, the love triangle but also how jazz music is incorporated into the film and I must say, this is one of the coolest, hippest soundtracks I have heard from an anime series.  So much that I wanted to purchase the soundtrack immediately because the music for this anime series was fantastic!

While those used to a certain style of anime may not like a series about a bromance, let alone about music, ""Kids on the Slope"" is probably one of the best anime series that I have seen in 2013 and I have to put this in my top three for anime series on Blu-ray for the year because it's that good!

Why is this anime series so captivating?

It's about the characters!  Kaoru is a guy who hasn't had many friends or social activities.  He is not good at reading people, nor is he that good at showing emotions.  That so many times, he reads things and his only way of communicating is with anger.  We see Kaoru as this meek character with glasses, always studying and playing the piano.

While Sentaro also never had many friends growing up, but you realize that the reason why he's gotten into so much trouble is because he was always bullied because he was not full Japanese.  He used his height and his strength to deter people from bullying him and he ended up getting into a lot of fights while growing up.  But like Kaoru, he also had a dysfunctional childhood.

Kaoru needs Sentaro, because he makes him feel wanted and important but most of all, he's the first guy who never treated him any less, but accepted him as a friend right off the bat.

Sentaro respects Kaoru for his magnificent piano playing but because he cares so much about him.  He lived life feeling that no one cares about him, thus he became a bully but now he has found a friend who believes in him.

And for both individuals, having each other as friends is not easy because they are so different, but despite their problems, they know that they make a great team and are very good friends.  But both are a bit too hardheaded to admit it.

Ritsuko is your good-natured female character and good friends with both.  She grew up with Sentaro and she always took care of him as he was always getting into fights.  She is his neighbor and Sentaro has always practiced the drums at her father's record shop.

But she sees how Sentaro has opened up to Kaoru and she knows he needs that. But as she gets to know Kaoru, she knows he needs Sentaro as well. But when she finds out that Sentaro likes another girl, let alone finding out that Kaoru has fallen for her, how is a girl supposed to react?

Throw in characters such as Yurika and Junichi and other dramatic situations that really bolster the storyline, the characters and also the emotional angle of the series.

I felt the series delivered in emotional impact when Kaoru felt that he was lonely and no one understood his feelings, but when he found out how his life was all this time and how he lived alone and had to endure abuse and bullying throughout his life, much worse than he has had, it was an emotional scene.  In fact, there are many of these emotional moments throughout the series and I was pleased of how the writing was. Both Ayako Katoh and Yuuko Kakihara did a wonderful job!

As for the Blu-ray release, the anime looks fantastic!  The character designs are different from what most people may be accustomed to but it actually has a taste of the old school anime that I grew up watching.  Characters are well-drawn, well-shaded and the art backgrounds are just beautiful too look at.

And as for special features, I was amazed to find interviews instead of the typical clean opening and ending animations.  So, you do get an interview with director Shinichiro Watanabe, composer Yoko Kanno but also with teenage musicians Takashi Matsunaga and Shun Ishikawa who were both found by Kanno on YouTube.  Two young professional musicians who know jazz music and really made the anime feel believable, entertaining and exciting.

Overall, ""Kids on the Slope: Complete Collection"" is an anime series that you rarely see these days.  The characters and the storyline just draws you in, the overall series is just delightful and so enjoyable!  From the creative team behind ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Kids on the Slope"" is not just highly recommended, it's on my list as one of the top anime series for 2013 on Blu-ray!

Highly recommended!",1372896000,3,8612,4.868131868131868
5559724,5,B00B6DTFK6,"When Kaoru Nishimi, a boy who gets so worked up with nerves that he's capable of making himself nauseous under stress, begins yet another school after moving in with his uncle and his family, he doesn't think things are going to be any different than before.  However, he perks up upon meeting pretty girl-next-door Ritsuko Mukae.  On the other hand, he doesn't know what to make of Sentaro Kawabuchi, the thuggish looking boy sitting behind him in class who almost everyone seems leery of except Ritsuko (who is soon revealed to be his childhood friend) and who has a reputation of getting into brawls.  It turns out, however, that the rep is a little unfair, as Sentaro is actually a bighearted guy who's a doting big brother of three who gets in trouble because he cheerfully throws himself into defending people he likes or who aren't as able as he is to defend themselves against creeps who deserve what he hands them.  Not only that, Sentaro also turns out to have a passion for jazz drumming, which piques Kaoru's interest as a classically trained pianist although he's enough of a snob that he initially turns his nose up at jazz considering it slumming.  When Sentaro learns that Kaoru is a pianist, he estatically insists that they jam together, which Kaoru allows himself to be talked into.  Sometimes joined by Ritsuko's cool dad Tsutomu - who owns the local record shop and acts as a father figure to all the kids - on bass, and Junichi Katsuragi - Sentaro's older brother figure who he affectionately calls ""Brother Jun"" - on trumpet, the two bond over a shared love of music.  For both of them, the trudge down the slope to school everyday is no longer so long...

Although their relationships with Ritsuko, Junichi and another girl named Yurika are significant, the bromance between Kaoru and Sentaro is the driving force of the story, as they help eachother through girl problems, social issues, family dilemmas and finally two simultaneous serious crises which strike Sentaro.  The fact that they aren't perfect - Kaoru can have a selfish streak and Sentaro can have a tendency to avoid problems - and that the situations they find themselves in don't always have a perfect or easy resolution gives the story a realistic streak.  The epilogue - in which we find out what paths in life the two chose - is also very satisfying and perfectly appropriate in light of everything we know about them, even fitting in Kaoru's musing that Sentaro is meant to be a father eventually in a way that Kaoru probably never expected but is ultimately completely in character in hindsight.

Kids on the Slope is a work that fans of Honey and Clover and Princess Jellyfish will also want in their collection.",1369440000,7,2708,4.740425531914894
5559725,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Finally! A music anime that has a soundtrack worth a damn. Sorry, BECK. GFY, K-ON.

Kids on the Slope IMHO also greatly benefits from the fact that the plot doesn't revolve around music, which often leads to cliche endings about some battle of the bands or something along those lines. Instead, Kids on the Slope is about friendship and romance, featuring a cast of interesting characters who happen to be heavily into jazz. And it works splendidly.

One of the best anime in recent years. Highly recommend it!",1369094400,,510,4.784090909090909
5559726,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Great music and a wonderful tale of youth, what more could you ask for? I was hooked on this before I even heard Shinichi Watanabe and Yoko Kanno's name! You'll laugh, be sad, cry, feel angry, heck, it's a rollercoaster of emotions! But in the end, you'll be smiling. It even introduced me to the wonderful world of Jazz. The soundtrack is amazing!

These are some cool kids and you really feel for them through their struggles. They're trying to find their place among their friends, family, and the world. Of course the supporting cast is great too, can't forget them! They all have their own story and I like how they were able to tie everything in and keep close to the manga. If you want more, check out the manga it was based off on. I highly recommend it!

5559727,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Update (May 7): Sentai have issued a statement that they are fixing the issue described below and have set up a replacement program for those who have one of the affected discs (doesn't matter what retailer you ordered from). Click the link in the first comment of this review to print out the mail-in form. Good on them for doing the right thing!

The original problem is detailed as follows...

On episode 11, the Japanese stereo soundtrack gets relegated to one speaker--the left one. Where's the right half of that stereo track? It isn't there. It's completely unattainable.

If this were the case of a mono track only coming out of one speaker instead of dual mono, it wouldn't be as big of a deal; but there's literally half of a cross-channel audio mix that's completely missing.

I find this lack of quality control deeply distressing, and it isn't the first time that Sentai has made this kind of goof on their Blu-ray encoding. It's the last time I ever preorder one of their Blu-rays; I will wait for reviews and reports on similar mishaps before deciding to plunk down a heavy wad of cash. And had I known of this problem before my set shipped, I wouldn't have bought it.

Sentai NEEDS to do a replacement program on this title. Sure, the English audio is unaffected, but for those of us who greatly prefer to watch anime subtitled, this is completely inexcusable. If it's a stressing matter to you, please email Sentai on the issue and request they do a replacement. It will cost them a good deal of money to press another disc and issue them out to fans who request it, but I think it would be the right choice on their part. More mishaps like this (and they're ever-increasing on select titles; they sometimes use 1080i transfers when the Japanese counterparts are 1080p, and this isn't the first time to have a left-channel-only episode) and they could stand to lose money and support on future releases. They need to hire a solid quality control staff to ensure things like this do not happen again. An occasional mistake can happen, but Sentai have quite a record of these problems on Blu-ray. (Their DVDs tend to be unaffected by the problems, and I've heard report that the stereo track is completely normal on episode 11 of ""Kids on the Slope"" on the DVD set.)",1367712000,4,2281,4.608374384236453
5559728,5,B00B6DTFK6,"When I saw the director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo was affiliated with this show it immediately came on my radar. It may have a different tone from those other two shows I mentioned, but it just as good. What is interesting about these three shows is the blending of unique music into the characters. In Kids on the Slope we see the use of jazz within a small basement band. The creation of this band brings together these kids and they become strong friends. However these friends face many hardships and have many hurdles to overcome. Rarely do we see friendship like this in anime. It is much more believable and heartfelt than many ridiculously exaggerated situations we see in most anime today.

The two main male characters are the stars of the show and their relationship is what drives the plot forward. Both of these characters are very well flushed out, but couldn't be more different. To give an example, Kaoru Nishimi plays the piano and is kind of a quite nerd with hate toward society. However Sentaro plays the drums and lives life to the fullest while also being quite reckless and loud. Their contrasting personalities are even seen within in the musical instruments, but the funny thing about jazz is that it blends these two instruments together to create a foot tapping melody.

Not often do we see anime like this one that blends music into the plot. Not to mention a good heterosexual male relationship between two high-school boys that is believable. You don't want to miss out on watching Kids on the Slope.",1364860800,3,1541,4.703703703703703
5559729,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Kids of the slope was one of those anime that i didn't care about until i heard the directors name Shinichiro Watanabe and that name alone got me hyped for this show cause of his past works which have been pretty successful for characterization and style for example like Cowboy Bebop which had wonderful characters and and the theme to Cowboy Bebop story was briefly mentioned but i got to say i don't regret watching this show and the music and the characters are so genuine and so full of heart i didn't think music such as jazz would be so inspiring it also makes u like wanna listen to Jazz your self and the also the music behind this show is done in collaboration with Yoko Kanno who also worked on Bebop,and Ghost In The Shell music. There's also some unexpected things you will find in this anime story  not in a bad way but in a good and gratifying way this is show is a gem that should not be missed.",1364256000,5,911,4.265895953757226
5559730,5,B00B6DTFK6,"Every once in a while, a series comes along that shakes you up, along with everything else around you. This series pretty much ruins anything you could potentially enjoy over the next year or so, because you'll always be comparing whatever you watch to it. These series include classics like ""Evangelion"" and ""Cowboy Bebop"", along with contemporary gems such as ""Welcome to the NHK"" and ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya."" Joining that pantheon of classic titles is ""Kids on the Slope"", which anybody who enjoys living and breathing is sure to love, regardless of whether they like anime or not.

Set in 1966, the series follows Kaoru, an introverted and bookish high school boy who is secretly skilled at the piano. However, his relatives seems to frown upon it, and thus, he focuses solely on studying. That all changes, though, when he meets Sentaro, a hotheaded boy with a bad reputation due to his somewhat violent disposition. But after being defended from bullies, Kaoru begins to see that Sentaro's reputation isn't deserved. They become fast friends, even more so when we learn that Sentaro is a drummer, and needs a pianist for a jazz group he plays with.

This should set the stage for a 1960's, ""K-On!""-esque tale of attempting to rise to the top of the musical world. However, that falls to the wayside quite quickly. This is really a story of first love, of clashing cultures, and of kids forced to deal with abandonment issues. It's human drama of the first degree, and while there is some optimism to be found, it has a bitter tinge of realism permeating the entire experience. The square focus of the show is on appreciating the little gifts life gives you, while learning how to cope with the fact that one must typically suffer before gaining those gifts.

What's really impressive about this narrative is how many social issues it touches on. This might be the first anime I've seen that really takes advantage of its time period. Post-war anti-American sentiments are hinted at, as are issues dealing with Japanese citizens following Christianity. Politics and religion are thrown into the stew, and simmered to perfection along with the other narrative elements. No matter who you are, you'll be hard-pressed to not find something in this series that is relevant to your life.

Little shock, then, that this comes from anime master Shinichiro Watanabe, director of classics ""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""Samurai Champloo"", who has exhibited this penchant for humanity before. However, I would argue that he does it best in this series. While ""Bebop"" is still my absolute favorite, Watanabe greatly benefits from honing in on a smaller story with less plot threads to worry about. This lets him flesh out his characters much more, and in fact, they become far less archetypal than any of his past ones. For the first time in a while, I genuinely cared about an anime love triangle (there's a big one that takes most of the series to tell), and wasn't left groaning like I do at so many romance anime. It was undoubtedly because I had grown attached to all of the characters, and couldn't stand to see even one of them get hurt. Truly a master of his craft, this director proves that he can deliver a slice-of-life tale just as compelling as anything Kyoto Animation has ever put out.

""Bebop"" fans will be overjoyed to hear the musical stylings of Yoko Kanno once again. However, like Watanabe, she reigns in her typical style to deliver something more distilled and focused. Instead of toying with several different genres, she focuses on doing one thing very well, with stellar results. You'd better enjoy jazz, because that's essentially all you'll be hearing. From new cuts made for the soundtrack, to excellent covers of old standards, Kanno shows a deftness with the style that's altogether unexpected and wonderful. Little nods to other popular styles of music of the time are also nice. This soundtrack is sandwiched between YUKI's excellent opener, and Motohiro Hata's solid closer, making for a well-rounded and killer musical experience.

Rounding it out is great animation, delivered by a studio founded by the ""God of Manga"", Tezuka Productions. Now, this studio rarely does anything that isn't based on a preexisting Tezuka work, and when they do, it tends to be something they feel confident in. Thank the heavens, then, that they felt confident enough to lend their hand to this masterpiece. The animation is positively gorgeous, never dropping in quality throughout the entire series. Environments are all period-accurate, as are all of the character and vehicle designs. Everything moves at a fluid and crisp rate, making small things like playing a piano seem positively exhilarating. A lot of the time, an anime series will have great animation at the beginning, crap in the middle, and good again at the end. Thankfully, this is not the case with ""Kids"", which is a visual treat up until the tearjerker of a finale.

Most anime released last year left me fairly cold; there were only a few series that really stuck out to me. But among those choice few, ""Kids On The Slope"" was by far the best. In fact, it may be the best anime of the past few years. After all, I feel confident in asserting that this is a classic of the highest caliber, to be remembered with greats like the aforementioned ""Evangelion"" and ""Cowboy Bebop."" A tale of bittersweet humanity told through excellent music and depicted with killer animation, ""Kids On The Slope"" is one of anime's rare masterpieces. Whether you pay for it or find it streaming, don't miss out on this one.

5559731,5,B00B6DTFK6,"I pre-ordered this on Right Stuf (blu-ray version).
I love everything about this anime, but not immediately. At first I was not liking the character designs (they are not done in a popular modern style that I am used to, shounen for instance is what i am used to), but I liked just about everything else. This continued, and in a short while I realized that I like the animation very much.

Kids on the Slope is a drama/romance that features a lot of jazz sessions and takes place in 1966. It is totally AWESOME. It does help if you like jazz though, but if you don't the story is extremely engaging and heart-wrenching. I would put this easily in my top 5 anime, even if you have never seen an anime before it is fantastic. One awesome thing about Kids on the Slope is it ignores a great number of cliches and tropes that plague most modern anime.

In conclusion, 3/5.
Watch It.

PS. I hope the dub is decent. If not, then learn Japanese, read Subs, or cry about it.

Edit: After watching, i lowered my score because of the dub quality, and because of the lack of english credits. (Yes they play after the episode, but it looks stupid) I love a great english dub, but Sentai Filmworks dubs are simply mediocre. In conclusion, the subs are just fine as is the video quality/menus.

It's such a light hearted anime that really pulls at the old heart strings with beautiful characters development, detailed animations when playing there instruments so they actually are playing them correctly and not just looking like they are slamming there hands around. If you watch the behind the scenes (and I  encourage you to) you'll see just how  precise they went with his fingers while playing the piano. The jazz of course is the best part you get to watch the characters grow and while they grow so does there jazz. They start the anime as wee young jazz babies that  have a knack for being cool cats, but by the end off the anime they are jazz  wizards that enchant the view with there beautiful jazz. It starts off nice and easy then BAM they kick it and start blessing your ear holes with the sweet sound of there music, filling the empty hole in your soul when the anime ends with pure jazz. You'll find your language has changed, you'll start saying ""catch you cool cats later"" and start bumping jazz in your car while you drive. The only thing that makes me mad is that the last volume of the manga was never turned into an anime so after the anime there is a episode missing that basically talks about what happeneds after the end, I won't tell you for spoiler reasons.",1504310400,,1336,4.440816326530612

The visuals are fantastic and the music is just incredible.  Yoko Kanno can do no wrong.  It is oddly a good tutorial on jazz.  Unfortunately the storyline and characters are somewhere between grating to cringeworthy to (I would assume) most heterosexual male adults.

The art is beautiful, and I enjoyed the moments where the unofficial jazz band got together and did live sessions (there were not enough of those scenes). The biggest con of this show is that it often devolved into will-they-won't they melodrama and an overuse of misunderstandings that would could have easily been cleared up if the three main characters simply talked instead of assumed. I was not crazy about the last two episodes; one plot point was just plain manipulative. Overall though, I really liked this mostly feel-good show, that also has some effective tear-jerking moments.
