2983285,5,B000WM4R2I,This is more than a romantic comedy- it has heart. It is a chick flick but really is more about the guys and what they go through- both as suitors and as fathers. There was a lot of ttruth in this movie about how tough this situation is for both. So this is a chick flick for guys. You will enjoy it.,1209772800,28,300,3.8548387096774195
2983286,4,B000WM4R2I,this movie shows how a city boy and a country girl can join together and live happily ever after.  We loved this movie and found no swear words in it and it suits our standard of living just fine.  We are christians and we need to watch more movies without so much of the worldly things in them.

2983287,4,B000WM4R2I,"I originally saw this movie on hallmark and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The story is sweet and any gal that has ever brought home a guy that didn't quite fit her dad's perfect image for her will relate with all the ""hoops"" the guy in this film jumps through to try to please his prospective father-in-law.  I found it offered both humor and an endearing quality with what this guy was willing to do for his love.  Probably is more a gal movie but if you like the farm, hunting, or the outdoors you might enjoy it as well.  In a time where a nice romance seems harder to find...this is a keeper!  Just don't expect a big blockbuster movie frill budget effects with the male and female actors of the moment and you'll enjoy it.",1202428800,83,721,4.311111111111111

Surprised to see Sally Struthers in and she has gained so much weight, scary.  Remember her on TV on All in the Family.
This movie is enjoyable to watch and I have several times and enjoy it each time.  Scenery is nice to see, wonder where it was filmed, in what state.

2983328,4,B000WM4R2I,"A city lawyer has just been offered a partnership in his firm at a six figure salary. His fianc is a country girl at heart who can't formally accept his proposal of marriage and make it public until he meets her family and gets her father's blessing. So, off to the ranch they go. His arrival in Pine Gap is inauspicious as a horse jumps out in front of his convertible and he swerves into a utility pole. This sort of sets the tone for the humorous aspect of this lighthearted romance. It seems for a while that he just can't get out of his own way.

The cantankerous father puts this city-slicker through the ringer while Sally Struthers plays the aunt who, though a lovable bundle of energy and country kindness, meddles in the affair trying to reunite the fianc with her high school sweetheart. This only brings about more mishaps where enough already exist.

Will this fish-out-of-water lawyer manage to prove his mettle in the father's eyes and win approval of the engagement?? (That's for me to know and you to find out.)",1411344000,,1028,4.551351351351351

After blundering through a bad first impression, James attempts to win over Sadie's lawyer-loathing father Karl by pretending to be a horse-riding, hay-baling, game-hunting, seasoned square dancer. But a pair of worn jeans and a ten-gallon hat don't make a cowboy, and it's going to take more than mere posturing to charm Mr. Ryder...in fact, it just may take a miracle.",1391644800,,620,4.904761904761905

2983363,2,B000WM4R2I,"I will begin by admitting the reason I didn't like this movie is I don't like the characters.  I understand now this is a ""Made for TV Movie"" which explains the poor script, acting and the lack of realism.  One thing is far to real, the family of the girl in the movie.  They remind me of my country in-laws who never thought I was any good since I didn't hunt, fish, drive a pick up truck, get drunk and have sex with anyone I could and then go to church on Sunday so I could get through the pearly gates of glory.

This movie attempts to make life in a small hick town wonderful.  The city boyfriend makes the mistake of being educated, flaunting tradition and using his vocabulary.  Once he saves his future father-in-law's life he is acceptable (only because he shot and killed a wolf) and he is won over to the hick town his girl wants to live in to be with her family.

The action is supposed to take place in a beautiful landscape, but either the producers were too frugal or the photography sucks because this is not evident.

On some day when I don't like the human race I will donate this to the library.  If you want a satisfying movie, don't buy this.  Save your money.  Turn on the TV and watch this crap for free.",1368921600,,1227,4.200854700854701

2983381,5,B000WM4R2I,"I highly recommend this movie especially if you love farm/western and romance movies. NOT just a ""chick-flick"". Excellent all the way around, one of the best movies ever made I would say.",1257292800,,187,4.875
2983382,3,B000WM4R2I,"A Los Angeles based female doctor and male lawyer are in love and plan to marry. She wants him to meet her father, brothers and see the place where she was raised, so they head to her family's ranch for Christmas. The rest is a bunch of unbelievable male posturing, stilted dialog, impossibly contrived circumstances and two-dimensional characters. That said, I enjoyed this made-for-TV movie. Why? I've narrowed it down to the light-handed way Christmas was blended into the film. There are some decorations here and there, and sporadic mention of the holidays but the main focus is not about gifts and a big feast, it is about the family and their relationships. The true star of the film, and perhaps what held my interest throughout, is the beautiful scenery. The mountains are absolutely gorgeous and the rural setting transported me from my world into their's even though the story is weak and characters largely unsympathetic.

Regarding the bonus Christmas CD included with the movie -- A Romantic Christmas -- it is all instrumental and muzak-like in style. It is background music, nothing anyone would focus on and thus is perfect to play during a meal or while gift wrapping or visiting with friends. The inclusion of The Chanukah Song on the ""A Romantic Christmas"" CD is an interesting choice. The songs included are We Wish You a Merry Christmas, We Three Kings, Ave' Maria, Away in a Manager, The First Noel, Feliz' Navidad, The Chanukah Song, It Came Upon a Midnight Clear, Lonely This Christmas and Silent Night.",1256256000,2,1528,4.899613899613899

2983386,3,B000WM4R2I,"As has been stated several times, there is nothing offensive in this movie. It also has the requisite Christmas romance ""happy ending"". But for me there was a lack of chemistry between the two leads, and I couldn't muster any sympathy for the leading man. The gruff father's rescue seemed contrived and his dramatic change of attitude was a stretch. The characters didn't come to life for me and some ""locals"" were portrayed more as caricature than characters--maybe that was for comic effect.
The setting is a nice change of pace from many others of its genre--a cattle ranch, rather than a small town with a Christmasy name, or a city with two busy people who find each other. There are no ""single-parents-dating-the-wrong-people"" that seem to be in so many Christmas chick-flicks, so there is some originality to the storyline.
I will probably watch this again (during an all-night gift wrapping session) but it won't be a top pick. It may be worth having if you don't have to pay too much to own it.",1246752000,4,1003,4.7371428571428575

I found it offered both humor and an endearing quality with what this guy was willing to do for his love.  Probably is more a gal movie but if you like the farm, hunting, or the outdoors you might enjoy it as well.  In a time where a nice romance seems harder to find...this is a keeper!

3217825,4,B000WM4R2I,"A city lawyer has just been offered a partnership in his firm at a six figure salary. His fianc is a country girl at heart who can't formally accept his proposal of marriage and make it public until he meets her family and gets her father's blessing. So, off to the ranch they go. His arrival in Pine Gap is inauspicious as a horse jumps out in front of his convertible and he swerves into a utility pole. This sort of sets the tone for the humorous aspect of this lighthearted romance. It seems for a while that he just can't get out of his own way.

The cantankerous father puts this city-slicker through the ringer while Sally Struthers plays the aunt who, though a lovable bundle of energy and country kindness, meddles in the affair trying to reunite the fianc with her high school sweetheart. This only brings about more mishaps where enough already exist.

3217860,2,B000WM4R2I,"I will begin by admitting the reason I didn't like this movie is I don't like the characters.  I understand now this is a ""Made for TV Movie"" which explains the poor script, acting and the lack of realism.  One thing is far to real, the family of the girl in the movie.  They remind me of my country in-laws who never thought I was any good since I didn't hunt, fish, drive a pick up truck, get drunk and have sex with anyone I could and then go to church on Sunday so I could get through the pearly gates of glory.

This movie attempts to make life in a small hick town wonderful.  The city boyfriend makes the mistake of being educated, flaunting tradition and using his vocabulary.  Once he saves his future father-in-law's life he is acceptable (only because he shot and killed a wolf) and he is won over to the hick town his girl wants to live in to be with her family.

The action is supposed to take place in a beautiful landscape, but either the producers were too frugal or the photography sucks because this is not evident.

On some day when I don't like the human race I will donate this to the library.  If you want a satisfying movie, don't buy this.  Save your money.  Turn on the TV and watch this crap for free.",1368921600,,1227,4.200854700854701

I was very surprised to see Sally Struthers (from All in the Family) in this movie, and although I didn't recognize her at first (she's the aunt) she can still act.

It also shows that money (the main character is offered a six-figure salary) is not the most important thing. The only downside was a slip of the Lord's name in vain.

She wants him to meet her father, brothers and see the place where she was raised, so they head to her family's ranch for Christmas. The rest is a bunch of unbelievable male posturing, stilted dialog, impossibly contrived circumstances and two-dimensional characters. That said, I enjoyed this made-for-TV movie. Why? I've narrowed it down to the light-handed way Christmas was blended into the film. There are some decorations here and there, and sporadic mention of the holidays but the main focus is not about gifts and a big feast, it is about the family and their relationships. The true star of the film, and perhaps what held my interest throughout, is the beautiful scenery. The mountains are absolutely gorgeous and the rural setting transported me from my world into their's even though the story is weak and characters largely unsympathetic.

Regarding the bonus Christmas CD included with the movie -- A Romantic Christmas -- it is all instrumental and muzak-like in style. It is background music, nothing anyone would focus on and thus is perfect to play during a meal or while gift wrapping or visiting with friends. The inclusion of The Chanukah Song on the ""A Romantic Christmas"" CD is an interesting choice. The songs included are We Wish You a Merry Christmas, We Three Kings, Ave' Maria, Away in a Manager, The First Noel, Feliz' Navidad, The Chanukah Song, It Came Upon a Midnight Clear, Lonely This Christmas and Silent Night.",1256256000,2,1528,4.899613899613899

3217883,3,B000WM4R2I,"As has been stated several times, there is nothing offensive in this movie. It also has the requisite Christmas romance ""happy ending"". But for me there was a lack of chemistry between the two leads, and I couldn't muster any sympathy for the leading man. The gruff father's rescue seemed contrived and his dramatic change of attitude was a stretch. The characters didn't come to life for me and some ""locals"" were portrayed more as caricature than characters--maybe that was for comic effect.
The setting is a nice change of pace from many others of its genre--a cattle ranch, rather than a small town with a Christmasy name, or a city with two busy people who find each other. There are no ""single-parents-dating-the-wrong-people"" that seem to be in so many Christmas chick-flicks, so there is some originality to the storyline.
I will probably watch this again (during an all-night gift wrapping session) but it won't be a top pick. It may be worth having if you don't have to pay too much to own it.",1246752000,4,1003,4.7371428571428575
