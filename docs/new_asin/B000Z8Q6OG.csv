8235089,3,B000Z8Q6OG,"please NOTE: this is transferred from a very old vhs video and is entirely in japanese, with no english subtitles or language options, and the quality of the dvd is fragile and worn with fading colour and ""jumpy"" picture(understandable though having been transferred from vhs). the drumming in the background continues throughout the entire video too and can be abit annoying because the sound of the instructions are drowned out (not that i understand japanese language anyway) from the drumming. the sound quality is fairly poor as well with constant buzzing (like what you'd hear from a very old vhs video cassette).

other than these initial problems, i found the different angles of the views of karate demonstration to be helpful. and they slow it right down and break down the movements to show you what to do. there is a 3D character to show where some of the strikes are to be thrown, which is also helpful. i found that alot of what had been shown in the classroom during the dvd resembles a great deal what my own class teaches. its a genuine dvd but unless you speak fluent japanese and don't mind the slightly poor quality of the dvd (plus constant drumming), i would probably recommend that you continue your search for another kyokushin karate instruction dvd. although having said that, you would still get alot out of learning from this dvd.",1265932800,7,1358,4.778723404255319

8235091,4,B000Z8Q6OG,"Very good display of Kata, including showing an above view, would recommend to anyone starting out.
My only reason for dropping a star would be the sound quality, the drumming was at sometimes quite annoying",1213401600,7,207,4.942857142857143
