1210578,5,B00000F67S,"I saw this film on the real screen.  I thought it had to be in the '50s, but the Internet served me again.

I can remember but one line or scene from this marvelous movie.  Gleason is talking about retirement from the Army.  McQueen is doing his thing.  ""What do you want to do Sarge?""

Gleason sighs, ""I want to go to an island where the young woman don't wear tops.  I want all of them to have [...] that point up.""

Yes to all of the other reviews.  I can get this film on tape in excellent condition for only $[...].  Why bother?  Didn't know that Henry did the music.  Thanks!

The teaming of Gleason and McQueen plays quite well on screen, and who can ever forget Gleasons' mastery over the Coke machine and how he'd tether McQueens' wild schemes. There are other scenes, but the bar brawl near the end of the movie was one of the best staged (for the time especially) and McQueen actually hurt his ribs after being tossed thru the entry partition. It was very realistic and brutal. And, that flying drop-kick that McQueen puts on Ed Nelson.

The best theme Henry Mancini ever wrote.

The best script Blake Edwards ever wrote.

The best directing Ralph Nelson ever did.

The best acting Gleason, McQueen and Weld ever did.

That's Hollywood thinking for you!

that this movie is so good that it would make many people in the film biz today
just give up and find a different line of work.)

1210582,5,B00000F67S,"It's a shame that this classic is going the way of all things. I don't know if service in the military is absolutely essential to appreciate this film, but those who have served can easily appreciate Gleason's and McQueen's genius in rendering their characters. Both figures are timeless and ever-present in the real military (the military that's generally not reflected in entertainment media because it's simply too real, ordinary and every-day) and Gleason and McQueen play them with dignity and a sensitivity that shows their characters for the ordinary human beings they are. These characters may be less compelling to the average movie-goer than those of Preminger or Spielberg, but they are much more typical of the institution that, for most Americans, exists in peacetime somewhere out there in the backstage of their minds.
One might argue that a movie about street sweepers would be just as relevant. To the degree that most Americans have well developed preconceptions about street sweepers that don't accord with the every day reality of street sweeping in our society, the argument may be justified. But I doubt that's the case. That most Americans have fairly concrete, if uninformed, notions about their standing military is hard to deny. That even informed citizens fail generally to distinguish between the peacetime and wartime institutions is nearly axiomatic (and not a peculiarly American phenomenon).
Nor should Gleason's and McQueen's characters be interpreted as exclusively American stereotypes. Anyone who has served in any professional military - American, Soviet, German, Chinese, French etc - will recognize these characters and appreciate the realism and drama these masters bring to their roles.
Movies like ""Soldier in the Rain"" (or ""The Pawnbroker"" or ""A Patch of Blue"") are evidence of what Hollywood can do when it's not just trying to sell movie sound tracks and sequel rights.",1034035200,70,1914,5.2993421052631575

1210614,5,B00000F67S,Thought it was a great movie.  Brought back a lot of memories from years ago when I was 18 years old.  I was doing six months active duty with the California National Guard.  I was at Fort Ord from April to October of 1963 and one thing that NEVER happened was rain. Overcast and chill in the morning but never rain.  And any one who's ever served the one thing that will be forever etched in your mind is Basic Combat Training.

1210646,3,B00000F67S,"I love Jackie Gleason (aka ""The Great One""). His acting in dramatic roles is always top-notch. I wish there were more Gleason dramas available. I had never heard of this film till it showed on TCM. So, this is not a review of the DVD or VHS copies, but of the film shown on TCM (which I assume to be complete, since that is the channel's specialty.)

Gleason's acting in this film is great. But, the film itself is very strange. Very strange, indeed. One of the strangest films I've ever seen. Why? Because it varies between a slapstick-y comedy and a seriously-sad drama. It does not combine them both in a successful manner. It is a jarring roller coaster for the viewer. Steve McQueen is overacting in a comic fashion. Jackie Gleason is portraying a serious, intelligent career army guy who can be funny -- a mostly realistic portrayal of a real human being. Tuesday Weld is a ditsy 18 1/2 year-old high school student (who looks much older than that age). And Tony Bill plays a goofy private on the order of Jerry Lewis' goofiest characters. Then you throw in a car crash that is more like a cartoon version of a car crash (where cars are totaled, but no one has the least bit of a scratch). Also, a photo contest for a calendar girl (as you might see in a Gomer Pyle episode. Why isn't Tuesday Weld asked to pose for the photo? I have no clue.) But then there also are 2 serious tragedies in the mix (I won't spoil the plot), and the viewer is confused: Is this a goofy comedy, or a serious tragedy. The juxtaposition is simply jarring -- not in a good way.

Because of this very odd mix of comedy/ tragedy I find the film to be an interesting failure. Worth watching if you are a Gleason fan, but it won't be a Gleason film favorite. Definitely not a great film for McQueen.",1426291200,,1780,4.342342342342342

1210731,1,B00000F67S,"I have noticed that most of the reviews for old movies are written by the fans of those films, so it can be hard to gage the film's actual quality. So let me be the lone voice of dissent and state that this film is a stinker, and it will remain one with or without the missing footage (some have claimed that parts of the film are missing from the DVD).

You certainly would be right to expect some quality from a project that involved the likes of William Goldman, Blake Edwards, Jackie Gleason, Steve McQueen, etc., but the whole thing is such a surprising misfire that I don't know where to start. The story ostensibly concerns the friendship between the Supply Sgt. (McQueen), who is full of pep and gumption, and the much older M/Sgt. (Gleason), a career army guy with brains. The two parts are so badly cast and written, however, that the friendship comes across as a false pretense. Not only is the Sargent character, a supposedly loveable goofball, not very bright, but McQueen, who later became best known for playing manly, silent types, overacts so much that the character comes across as mentally challenged. It's a strange, forced performance, and the mugging is as tiresome as the character is annoying (incidentally, almost all the supporting characters badly overact, which suggests a very poor director, and one who wanted to instill a sense of madcap lunacy on a project without any). On the other hand, Gleason (the only one in the film who under-acts) seems bored and depressed, and his delivery suggests an actor who finds the whole project beneath him (which, of course, it was). Not only do these guys have zero chemistry and would never even be friends, but in their scenes together, you get the sense that Gleason is just humoring the Sgt. so that he leaves him alone. Frankly, given how stupid the Sgt. is (his business ""ideas"" include buying penguins for no apparent reason), the Major is surprisingly tolerant, though he does take advantage of the guy and other soldiers, manipulating them to work for him (this, by the way, contradicts the film's portrayal of the Major as a nice guy). That's not the only totally implausible relationship in the film, though. Later on, Gleason connects with Tuesday Weld's character, and the sight of this 40-year old (he was actually closer to 50) on a romantic date with a ditzy, high-school teenager is pretty creepy. Still, you'd expect some tension or drama to come out of that, but there's not even a love triangle. The fat man wins her over and that's it.
Besides the bland, and forced comedy business that would be rejected even by ""Gomer Pyle"" sitcom writers, everything else is so lame and mawkish that it is difficult to describe. Towards the end, there are two attempts at tragedy that come out of left field and are likely to leave you scratching your head rather than wiping away tears. Anyway, a dull, unbelievable, and pointless exercise that unsuccessfully mixes comedy with drama and achieves neither. The only funny thing in the film is how dated it is: at one point, McQueen is accused of drunk driving, but he swears that he only had four beers (unbelievably, this isn't meant to be a joke).",1390780800,4,3175,4.731046931407942

1210763,4,B00000F67S,"I never had heard of SOLDER IN THE RAIN until I started researching Steve McQueen and have been trying to see them all. A Jackie Gleason-Steve McQueen pairing? It may seem odd but in the end it works and SOLDIER IN THE RAIN is a surpisingly warm and heartfelt comedy-drama.
Supply Sgt. Eustis Clay is played by a very different Steve McQueen. The cool McQueen is there as is a sort of awkward McQueen. McQueen plays Clay with an odd accent and for a while it's hard to determine if Clay is just an poorly educated country boy or if there is something deeper going on. Clay idolizes his superior Sgt. Maxwell Slaughter played by the ever unique Jackie Gleason. Clay will do anything to make Slaughter happy and here is the basis of an odd relationship.
What a cast to praise. A lovely young Tuesday Weld is Bobby Jo Pepperdine. Tony Bill has a great quirky role as one of Clay's pals. Add in a young Tom Poston and we have a great cast. Blake Edwards was at the beginning of his career and cowrote this play.
Stay with the movie to appreciate its beauty. It has a slow and silly start. Eustis Clay is an awkward soldier and probably not anyone's first choice for defending the nation yet he has a subtle charm. The subtle beauty of this film is the obvious never takes place. Tuesday Weld's Bobby Jo gets set up with Sgt, Slaughter rather than the more appropriate in age Sgt. Clay. It's an awkward relationship as Bobby Jo uses unkind size-related remarks towards Slaughter but Slaughter begins to shine as the one decent and caring older man Bobby Jo has meant. They both begin go respect each other. A beautiful story develops.
Unfortunately, as things begin to fall into place and we want to see relationships develop further, the movie ends. SOLDIER IN THE RAIN is one of McQueen's forgotten gems but it should not be overlooked. It's too bad the film has not be widely released on DVD by the studio and is only a DVD on demand from Amazon.

1210786,1,B00000F67S,"I was very excited to see that ""Soldier in the rain"" had finally come to CD format.
I remember seeing this movie when I was in highschool back in the early '70's and cried at the end of it.  Well, I not only cried at the end again, but cried and moaned during the movie.  Why?  Because about 15-20 minutes has been cut out of the movie, just like the VHS version.  Segments cut out here and there do really tamper with the continuity of the movie.  If I had not seen the COMPLETE movie on TV a few times, I would have definitely had troubling following the story.  Only by filling in (in my mind), the parts that had been cut out, was I able to understand the story.  My youngest son, watched the movie with me.  I told him as the movie unfolded how this, that and the other thing was cut out.  He asked ""why would they do that Dad ?""  I SAID, I DON'T KNOW.  SAD, THAT A GOOD MOVIE HAS BEEN RUINED, AND MY MONEY HAS BEEN WASTED ON A ABRIGED VERSION AND NOT THE FULL-LENGTH MOVIE THAT I THOUGHT I PURCHASED",1325548800,27,1005,4.050761421319797
1210787,4,B00000F67S,"Blake Edwards was a director who tended to specialize in slapstick movies such as THE PARTY and the Pink Pather series. In this, among his earliest films, the violence is taken seriously. Just wait till you see the barfight!! However, this movie is primarily about the comradeship between a very obese sergeant (Gleason) and a supply officer (McQueen) with endless schemes about getting rich. The supply officer entertains the sergeant with constant ideas about investing; the sergeant seems to be forever bailing out the officer from all the knuckleheaded things he gets himself into! This provides the film with lots of laughs, but simultaneously it contains drama.
  The supply officer introduces his much older sergeant friend to a teen-aged beauty (Tuesday Weld, who will knock you off your couch), and they hit it off, against all odds. Nonetheless things don't look up in the story. The supply officer has been waiting a long time to be discharged and return home to be reunited with a special individual, but trouble rears its head. I won't detail anything else about the plot from here, but I will suggest that you see this movie. Several critics have attacked its blend of comedy and drama, but so what? Variety is good. Oh, this film didn't succeed when released, but that's only because of the timing. Shortly after John Kennedy was shot was when it premiered!
  While Gleason was thought of as a comedian, he was an equally adept dramatic actor, which you'll see here. McQueen has a rep as an action star, but in this movie he plays the dim-witted hillbilly soldier to perfection. There are many funny scenes here, and several dramatic scenes that will touch you.",1320451200,3,1676,4.890845070422535
1210788,5,B00000F67S,"I liked the book (and all books by this author, William Goldman) very much, and so saw the flick.  It's a great movie I thought.  I like the 3 principles in it to begin with, plus it's a good movie.  BTW I was in the military, and in no way related, compared or was reminded by this movie of that horrible time in my life.  I'm not going to buy this flick however, though that's what I came to this site to do.  $20 is a bit much for a DVD-R.  Maybe it's a good DVD-R.  But I don't want it.  It's a good movie, why the hell hasn't it long ago been released professionally?  Lots of crap has. And Neil Simon's ""Only When I Laugh"" - another favorite of mine - Marsha Mason, James Coco - terrific - been on a notify me list for that one for over a year.

Highly recommend Goldman's short novel that this flick was (faithfully) adapted from.

Just watched a Warners Arkive flick, a DVD-R like this one (Jolson, 1934).  Sound and picture were perfect, disc and case commercial.  My misgivings were wrong.  May buy ""Soldier in the Rain"" after all.",1320192000,2,1041,4.191919191919192

He's in the Army and counting the days until he's out.  He's got bigger things on his mind once he's discharged.  He spends his time learning from Jackie Gleason.  Jackie Gleason is a Supply Sergeant and has an angle on everything.  This was written by William Goldman, the same man who brought us The Princess Bride, but totally different.  If you're interested in a different Steve McQueen, this is for you.  While a bit pricy I was glad the DVD played on our DVD player and was thrilled with how fast it was delivered and the condition it arrived.",1307750400,2,687,4.528455284552845
1210791,5,B00000F67S,"SOLDIER IN THE RAIN is a relatively little-known film that has been quite overshadowed by Steve McQueen's  King of Cool classics.  Yet...it is one of his absolute best! His performance is unlike any he ever played before or after - and it is totally believable and unique. Jackie Gleason - brilliant in his dramatic turns in THE HUSTLER and REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT - outdoes himself in the role he plays in this film.  Tuesday Weld is a somewhat neglected actress - yet in this movie her character is sexy and stupid yet profoundly poetic at times - and you believe every second of her performance.  Ed Nelson has a tarnished shine as a cruel and corrupt MP.  Tony Bill plays an annoying goofball - and he does this remarkably well.  Along the way there is Tom Poston standing in sauerkraut juice to ged rid of his semi-corns and a start-of-his career Adam West.  The Henry Mancini music score is flawless.  Direction, cinematography, pacing, dialog - all top-shelf.  And there is one of the best bar-fights ever put on film to boot!

Many people get confused by the comedy/drama genre.  They expect a film to be one or the other.  Yet...life itself is a dichotomy.  It is dual by nature.  Laughter and tears carry us from cradle to grave, so why shouldn't a movie reflect this larger embrace of Life and all of its nuances?

As with other releases under the banner of the Warner Brothers Archives, there are no chapter stops, no menu, no commentaries, nothing...except for the film.  Yet for a reason I do not know, there is a brief scene deleted from this print.  It is a cafeteria confrontation between the protagonists and the antagonists.  Also, when I was in my teens and would catch this film on TV the main credits were accompanied by the main theme played by trumpet with orchestral backup.  The main theme is amongst Mancini's finest.  I think it is even better than ""Moon River"" and ""Days of Wine and Roses.""  The trouble is, when I would see it at other times on TV, the credit sequence would sometimes be accompanied by a carefree, Pink Panther-like tune that readied the viewer more for a whimsical comedy than the fuller spectrum of Life that the film actually conveys.  Sadly, the hauntingly beautiful theme is not used on this DVD for the credit sequence.  The back of the DVD also boldly states ""Forward March to Comedy for Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen!""  This blurb makes me wonder if the blurb-writer even saw the movie.  Yes, there are funny moments throughout - but this is not a Jerry Lewis movie.

If you have not seen the movie and want to, it is best to enter the story as one enters the world each day: not knowing what to expect.  In my opinion, it should be this way with ALL movies and books.

SPOILER ALERT: However, for those who have seen SOLDIER IN THE RAIN, this film contains a wordless sequence between McQueen and a Pepsi machine that sums up the impact of death upon those left behind in a way that speaks volumes without the utterance of a single word. It is one of McQueen's finest, albeit brief, moments as an actor. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  And yes - if you have a heart and soul - tears will definitely flow. I daresay, the sequence to which I refer is arguably the BEST encapsulation ever put on film of what it means to lose someone you truly love - and miss.  Get out the Kleenex box!

This is a movie that should definitely not be missed by anyone who truly loves film.  And here's to the island of our dreams...where they DO point up!",1307491200,13,3507,4.482649842271293

1210823,5,B00000F67S,"""Soldier in the Rain"" is not an easy film to pigeonhole.  To call it a service comedy is doing it something of a disservice.  For sure there's moments of askewed humor but there's also a resounding poignancy to the film.  The narrative's structure is unlike any I've seen before.  One has to watch carefully to appreciate the rewards this film offers.  Essentially the story revolves around the relationship between two Army operators, Eustace Clay(Steve McQueen) and Maxwell Slaughter(Jackie Gleason).  This is not so much a fraternal relationship but a paternal one.  Clay, full of spit and vinegar, emulates the more subdued Slaughter.  Slaughter, a melancholic Army lifer, admires the high-spirited Clay.  There's a certain buoyancy to McQueen's performance that I haven't seen in his other work.  It's a daring turn that makes you see McQueen in a different light.  Gleason has played restrained before, as demonstrated in ""The Hustler"", and there's something touching about his work here.

1210856,5,B00000F67S,"I remember the first time I saw ""Soldier in The Rain"".  It was on the NYC based cable forerunner WHT.  I was riveted to the screen.  This is not like any other Steve McQueen film; he plays a goofy supply sergeant fed up with the army and looking forward to civilian life.  His pal, Jackie Gleason, is a lifer and wishes to remain so, and yet the camaraderie between them is thoughtful and bittersweet.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love all of McQueen's films and am especially fond of his cool, anti-hero characters like Vin in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and Hilts in ""The Great Escape"".  But I must say that there will always be a special place in my heart for ""Soldier in The Rain""...mostly because it IS different.  The supporting cast is remarkable--especially Tuesday Weld.  Vietnam Vets will certainly remember the name Chris Noel; this was her first film appearance.

terrific performances from Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen.

Tuesday Weld contributes a nice turn in a supporting role.
