We must never forget the sacrifices made by our brave young men, still interned on that island. A horrific battle.",1453852800,,249,4.555555555555555
8104930,5,B000E371V4,"The best documentary on the battle of Peleliu that I have watched.  I would have liked for it to have more about the 81st Infantry Division in it, but still a very good video.  Primarily actual battle scenes are shown, and covers some of the Japanese preparations for the battle.  This is a good video for those interested in the battle on Peleliu and the war in the Pacific in general.",1431302400,,386,4.408450704225352
