8564422,4,B00B91R73C,"This Hong Kong comedy involves a romance that develops between an insurance agent (played by pop star Alan Tam) and a lady ghost (the very appealing Joyce Ngai). The version I saw was in the original Cantonese language with English subtitles so I was spared the awful dubbing that marks the typical HK film from this era. I found the characters and plotting a little thin but the film possess a quirky charm that makes for a reasonably entertaining 90 minutes. Alan Tam supplies a beautiful song.

I was fortunate to find a new copy of this film; I imagine it is hard to find in this market.

The film is categorized as IIA in Hong Kong, roughly the equivalent of a PG rating in the USA.
