3107630,3,B0013FSL1Q,"Director Kimberly Peirce's last film was the revolutionary, emotionally-charged and truthful ""Boy's Don't Cry"" with the galvanizing performance of Hilary Swank. That was over 8 years ago and now she has returned with the Iraq War drama, `Stop-Loss"" starring a coterie of edgy, hot young actors.
Oddly enough, I think that almost all of the Iraq War based dramas like the recent ""Rendition"" have been failures at the box office which leads me to wonder, why?
Perhaps, since it is literally happening now, it is too current: the wounds are opening daily with no healing in sight. At the very least, We as Americans are conflicted about our involvement in Iraq.
Peirce has chosen to use the Iraq War as a background onto which she bases her drama with Universal themes of: Where do I fit in? Where do I belong? Do I belong?
Working here with co-writer Mark Richard, Peirce has found a subject in the way the war in Iraq is tearing apart many of its soldiers, in combat and when they return home. This is a wrenching story of men at arms who cannot find peace outside the military circle, who return to civilian life on the horrific edge of violence and despair. This point of view is of course not new, going back at least as far as William Wyler's ""The Best Year's of Our Lives"" and  Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter."" War is Hell: this we all know and can empathize with but the aftermath, the coming home, the re-adjusting to Life after War is worse.
Several actors shine here: primarily the Brandon King of Ryan Phillipe (whose stop-loss forced re-enlistment forms the backbone of this film) and the Michele of Abbie Cornish who basically steals the film from under all her hot shot male cast members with her persuasive, thoughtful and totally believable performance.
There are several scenes in ""Stop Loss"" which approach and sometimes go over the edge into hokiness but overall, this film has a real emotional life: these are characters who emote from a real place, a place that it is obvious that Peirce believes in, invests in and ultimately it is the saving grace of this flawed, yet sock-in-the-gut experience film.",1206748800,15,2124,4.725067385444744
3107631,5,B0013FSL1Q,"There are films that make you feel you wasted your time, films you leave in the middle of or at the beginning because of the lack of content, this is NOT one of them.  This film will get GREAT reviews or it will get bad ones from those that would once again vote for the guy with ""W"" as a middle name.  You will love it or hate it; there will not be a middle of the road on this one.  Let's leave the politics out of it folks, this is a film that does not pull at you, it yanks your heart right out of your chest if you have one - I left it feeling human because it moved me, and made me THINK.  President John F. Kennedy once said to 5 Nobel laureates having dinner in the White House that there had never been so much intelligence gathered at one time in this room with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dinned alone (I would have given the credit to his friend and spiritual guide John Adams but let's leave that for another day).  One of Thomas Jefferson's best known quotes - ""Those that would give up their freedoms in the name of SAFETY and SECURITY will be neither SAFE nor SECURE and certainly not free.  The current policies of this country have fed on the American obsession with our personal safety, maybe we should listen to one of our founding fathers.  AS a 26 year fire fighter veteran - I think there is a time to leave a burning building because staying and dying is not going to accomplish anything.",1206662400,5,1432,4.1854545454545455
3107632,4,B0013FSL1Q,"An excellent attempt at trying to inform citizens of how our soldiers are used as fodder after being guaranteed of discharge after serving multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the length of service they contracted to serve. This movie shows how a GI returning home for discharge is lied to and ordered back to Iraq, under the Stop-Loss program. Just in case those reading this think it is unpatriotic of me not to agree with violating a serviceman's contracted voluntary enlistment, my background is one of having retired after 20 years in the Air Force, as a Fighter Pilot who flew two one year combat tours in Vietnam. Another example of a war we were lied to about, insofar as the reason we fought, and over 58,000 died fighting.",1206662400,4,739,4.6923076923076925

3107678,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Outstanding film.  Great acting, great cinematography, excellent pace and timing.  Made me think of some of the maimed kids (about 20 years old) that I've seen when participating in a program to get severely wounded (up to and including loss of both legs plus one arm and most of the fingers on the remaining hand) vets into the ocean on surfboards.  Also made me think of some of the stop-loss resisters I've read about.
To those who complain about a lack of realism: no film is ever perfect in this regard.  Yes, when they chased the Arab shooters into that alley it had ambush written all over it.  Let's not pretend that no unit ever set itself up for disaster - it happens in all wars.  (One of my friends who was Special Forces in Vietnam had some insane stories about huge screwups that led to disasters like this.)  Remember the Jessica Lynch fiasco?  SNAFU from start to finish.  Few people recall that a mission to secure a key bridge was deprived of necessary support which was diverted to the ""rescue"" mission, and for that reason the unit securing the bridge suffered heavy casualties including friendly fire from aircraft.
As for the PTSD, I had adult night-school students who had served in Iraq who were totally unpredictable - you never knew which personality was going to emerge on any given night.  That stuff is real.",1481241600,,1337,4.651063829787234

Sadly four of those ended up committing suicide yet our government did nothing for them beforehand to try to help them.

The disappointment, anger, and resentment felt by Phillippe's character was palpable, even for someone like me who never served. Our soldiers sacrifice so much for this country but as we see with the current VA issues that sacrifice is seldom met with the dignity and honor that these heroes deserve. This film offers insight into a reality for many soldiers that I wasn't even aware of leading our protagonist to make some hard decisions.

But what do you expect from a media group who's only past was dumb music videos and now reality shows. The movie just wastes your time watching. However, its audience is the younger crowd of today who probably does not know who the President of this country is or has never read a newspaper and who's only information comes from Facebook.

Before today, I had no knowledge of the existence of a ""stop-loss"" system. How unbelievably cruel and unfair to all those broken souls who need to put an end to this nightmare. The cinematography, the directing, and most obviously the acting by all the main characters are all extraordinarily good. The vast majority of these actors were unknown to me, yet they performed with an intensity and depth of feeling that seasoned actors would envy.

The USA is today as powerful as Roman Empire 2000 years ago. I think most people around the World should agree in that. And in fact, Roman Legions fought also in the same land today known as Iraq, Lybia, Mesopotamia, Judea  or as it were.
The big differences are, until 200 years, wars and battles were separated in time by years, months or almost weeks between one to another armed engagement or combat, yes, owing to long foot marches, horses and mules, or unfinishable warship sailing. But todays war is a fight of 24 hours over 24. In the past, crucial battles as Trafalgar were fought my military men commanded at last by his respective kings, which knew each enemy king very well.
Instead todays unstoppable, continuum type of war began with First World War, and with these, many new nervous and physical sequels. Roman legionnaires had no machine guns, rockets or airplanes nor snipers rifles, and rested and sleep between battles. Surely they were very hungry, but there was ever a slight human forced stop between combats.  Yes, also the conscription were compulsory, no voluntary, for example,  in the days of the Nelson Navy, and recruitment was brutal and forced.
But the physical and sociological condition of ancient soldiers from big historical military powers was similar to these of the common civilian peasants and common people from his times: they all were poor, accustomed to a hard, short life. Of course, Julius Caesar was rich, but the supreme general ever is an exception.  However, I think in the USA of today, social differences are too much big. In this film the soldiers doesnt no seem very favored social or economically, so, I find an order as the Stop Loss is badly received to go back to a war poorly understood with high possibilities of ending killed or seriously wounded, physical and mentally.
A good film far of the false, unbelievable heroism of Rambo and similar movies and technically well achieved.",1395619200,,2151,4.821138211382114

3107988,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop-Loss is not for everyone.  While it may begin as a typical war movie with lots of shootings, bombings, explosions and the whole assortment of things you associate with a war (and done rather realistically might I add) the film soon turns into a much *much* slower-paced drama involving one of the soldiers coming home, spending time with his family and refusing to return to Iraq.  He believes he did his time and watched enough of his friends die that he shouldn't have to return, but it turns out he's being forced (hence the name of the movie- Stop-Loss means the soldier is forced to return to war due to an enlistment contract) so he spends quite a bit of his time (75% of the film) making plans on how he's going to avoid having to go back.

For us however, the viewers, he spends most of his time walking around with his friends, girlfriend and family.  Now when I mention this is a slower-paced movie, I seriously mean it- if you're not patient enough, you won't be able to stay focused.  It's *that* slow.  However, it's interesting if you're willing to make an effort to pay attention to the storyline and there's never really anything confusing that takes place.  Perhaps the film is a good 30 minutes overlong, but just be aware of its slower pace and that if you're expecting a violent and exciting war movie, you'll be disappointed.

The ending is decent at least.  A surprise.  I think most of us are expecting *that* to happen (without spoiling what it is) but... no.  Interesting conclusion there.",1371772800,,1519,4.609665427509293

3108011,1,B0013FSL1Q,"This movie had a lot going for it.  First of all, Kimberly Pierce's debut film `Boys Don't Cry' is one of the best films of the 90's and is hauntingly realistic in its approach to a taboo subject.  Pierce proved she had talent but also that she had the gravitas to carry a film of that weight with respectable intensity and honesty.  Her hands in a project of this nature should have meant something.  Then you have the cast; a who's-who of young talent.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been on the upswing for years now and he is only getting better.  Abbie Cornish is considered something special by some, and her performance in `Bright Star' was uncannily excellent.  Channing Tatum is one of those actors who oozes charisma and just draws you to him.  The weak link here is obviously Ryan Phillippe, and yet he's always been at least engaging even when he wasn't really `acting'.  Then you have the subject.  War is very tricky, especially when you are depicting a war that is so current and so fresh in the minds of millions.  This is something that cannot be taken lightly, no matter what your stand is on the matter.  Honestly, all of these elements should have come together to produce something sacred and yet...

It didn't.

From the opening segments that contain teen angst music crushing down over a series of depictions of war-like violence and soldier comradery, it becomes evident that this film isn't taking itself seriously.  It's trying to make something stylized and engaging for a typical audience; the MTV crowd.  This isn't smart fare but dumbed down to draw in an audience that doesn't know the difference.

""Cool man, Ryan Phillippe is so mad that he has to go back to Iraq, so he punched out that other soldier and went AWOL!""

""Dude, Channing Tatum would so kick Ryan Phillippe's ***!""

""Whoop, whoop, yah, let's kill some Iraqis!""

The plot breakdown feels contrived and uninspired.  They really didn't think this through enough to create something that felt realistic.  Instead, each and every situation feels disjointed and presented solely to convey a desired effect that isn't in the least bit probable.  The depictions of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder feel overdone, especially when everyone seems to suffer from the same issues.  There is no diversity and so everything feels instilled to get our sympathies up.  Some of the points are picked up and then dropped with no explanation, causing one to wonder just why they were addressed in the first place.  And then you have the whole `stop-loss' situation and the drastic measures taken by Phillippe's character, which make no sense.  On top of that, (because I understand that dramatic embellishments are necessary at times to create cinematic tension) the handling of the character arc is ridiculous.  The end is so convoluted it's embarrassing.

But that isn't the worst of it.

The character development in general is horrible.  None of these characters are the least bit interesting, and their relationships don't make sense.  They are just angry and hit each other all the time, yell and demean and criticize.  But they're best friends.  The film made our soldiers look like a bunch of hooligans who don't even begin to understand the meaning of their profession.  Say what you will about war itself (I personally don't support the idea), but there has to be honor found in order to create something human.  The approach here made the war and those involved look like a joke, and not in a profound or subjective way.  They just threw this away.

And then you have those horrid performances given but Cornish and Phillippe that just made me want to vomit.

This film is a waste, a total disgusting waste, which is sad because it had promise on paper that turn, quickly, into trash.",1318809600,3,3764,4.821875
3108012,2,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop Loss was a swing and a miss - the topic is interesting and one that hasn't received a lot of attention (soldiers required to reup).  However, for all its intentions, the movie misses the target and becomes a mess of disjointed portrayals of flashback induced psychological struggles for the main characters. Bad choices by two of the primary actors (Phillippe and Cornish) to attempt to Texas accents end up having them sound mentally deficient in Phillippe's case - or just plain unintelligible in the case of Cornish.  Cornish's performance is flat and uninteresting - a total snoozer.  Phillippe started out rather engaging and was strong in the scene where he gave an akward speeech at his home town welcome parade - however his attempts at portraying stronger emotions felt forced and over the top.  Bad directing and a poor script added to the mess of the film.  Rating is two stars because some of the supporting cast was worth watching - otherwise skip this one.",1316217600,,975,4.849397590361446
3108033,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Victor Rasuk & Abbie Cornish....
Some of the hottest and most promising of modern-day Hollywood's young actors.
About 15 minutes into this movie, I was very much enthralled by it's storyline and acting.
It's a pretty good chronicle of what today's young service men & women go through in the
ongoing Iraq conflict. Basically, after coming home to the states again, after serving admirably
in many military missions, Ryan Phillippe's character, all set to ETS, finds himself in a fix
with the very military he's served so well. They have a quite shady backdoor re-draft policy known as
a STOP-LOSS, where they can re-up soliders who have already fought, and who are about to end their
tour of duty. All of the characters are dealing with their own re-adjustment issues; Channing Tatum's
character is prone to fits of violence, and delusions that he is back in Iraq, in the heat of battle.
He finds it impossible to maintain any intimate long-lasting relationships, other than with
his war brothers. His girlfriend / fiance', played by Abbie Cornish, feels scared, helpless, and frustrated
against her boyfriend's plight, and often turns to his best friend----Yes, you got it!---Ryan Phillipe's character,
in times strife and confusion. The two form a bond/attraction, which leads to a torn-between-two-lovers
stress point later in the film. J. Gordon-Levitt's character is struggling with alcoholism.
He tries religion, but needs something more substantial than that. Sadly, solace doesn't come for him.
Victor Rasuk's character gets severely injured early on in the film, and does a very good job
playing a solider of latino descent, who is rendered helpless in the prime of his life.

To tell the truth, after awhile, Phillippe's character, (usually the pillar of strength for all his buddies),
becomes a bit ragged around the mental edges too, as he is basically rendered a fugutive / AWOL from military duty...
A situation he doesn't deserve to be in. But in a STOP-LOSS situation, this is often the case.
Without giving the movie away further, the film takes some interesting turns, and all the actors did an
excellent job in the portrayal of their roles. Like the movie, ""The Hurt Locker"", which was an Iraq-era
type of film too, but from a different perspective, ""Stop-Loss"" was directed by a female director...
Kimberly Pierce, who did a stellar job in that capacity.
Though I loved Jeremy Renner's character in ""Hurt Locker"", I didn't find the directing as tight and
refined, nor the storyline as clear and easy to follow as with ""Stop-Loss"".
To me, ""Stop-Loss"" should have been the film getting all the accolades and awards.
I must add that the themes of friendship, loyalty, loss, betrayal, duty, etc. run throughout as well.
To me, a female director always seems to interweave more emotional depth in a film.
Not that male directors can't or don't...but the women directors really excel in that area.

It's already established that Ryan Phillipe is a very good actor, but Channing Tatum should not
be slept on either!---More and more, with each role, he is proving himself to be a very credible actor.
I give this movie **5 Stars**  A Very Good Film.",1312934400,4,3215,5.01685393258427

3108036,4,B0013FSL1Q,"The first 10 minutes you're thrown into a shoot out in the middle of the Iraq War.  Civilians are killed and so are soldiers.  Three of the soldiers go back home to Texas and are welcomed with open arms.  The soldiers are played well by Ryan Phillippe, Joseph Gordon Lewitt and Channing Tatum.  Ryan Phillippe who generally doesn't tend to show all that much range in his films does so in this.  He's pretty convincing and if you're not paying attention you may not recognize him he's that absolved in the character.  He discovers after being home for a very short time that he's been stop-lossed and has to be shipped back to Iraq.  He goes AWOL and on the run.  The rest of the details I'll leave up to you to see as it is worth seeing.  It's probably not as accurate, realistic or as great as ""The Hurt Locker"", but it is good.  It's got a lot of thrown in drama.  All three of the guys seem to be experiencing severe post traumatic stress disorders from the war.  I imagine it probably does haunt many soldiers and those that see a lot of deaths, but ironic that it's all three soldiers. I guess it's all part of the movie magic.  This is a little bit of fiction and a little of bit of truth, you decide which.  This isn't another film about the Iraq War, but more a film about the ""Stop-loss policy"" which many don't know much about and should.  Many soliders are involuntarily forced to go back and serve in the war when they don't want to.  I'm sure there are those who disagree with it and find this to be inaccurate.  I just thought it was a good movie and not interested a political debate on it otherwise I'd watch a documentary on the subject.",1304467200,,1655,4.287096774193548
3108037,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop-Loss is a rather intense film that focuses on the military's ""stop-loss"" program--a practice that allows the military to re-deploy American troops back to combat duty in places like Iraq even when they have completely fulfilled their obligations by doing their complete tour of duty. The film's plot moves along well although a few minutes could have edited out to make the story a bit more gripping. The acting is extremely convincing; the choreography and cinematography enhance the movie quite a bit. The casting was excellent and the script well written, too. I should also mention that I really appreciate the input from soldiers and their families; because of them I know so much more about ""stop-loss"" than I otherwise would have if I had just watched this film. It's important to note that the filmmaker is neither truly anti-soldier nor cheering for a man who has gone AWOL, Kimberly Peirce is protesting the ""stop-loss"" program; and if you watch the movie from this perspective I think you will like it more.

When the action starts, we meet decorated Staff Sergeant Brian King (Ryan Phillippe) and some of his very good buddies including Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Sergeant Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) returning home from combat duty in Iraq. To one degree or another, they are all upset about the trauma they experienced during combat, seeing some of their best friends die and others like Private Rico Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk) terribly maimed for life, losing his sight and more than one limb. However, Brian is relieved and at least somewhat optimistic about his future because he's ""gettin' out;"" he wants to adjust to life as a civilian in his native Texas again--until, that is, he finds out from a bureaucratic cog in a wheel that he is being unexpectedly ""stop-lossed:"" he must now return to Iraq and serve even more time.  While his buddy Steve doesn't see a problem with this (Steve has been sent back, too), Brian is very disgruntled; and his brief and unproductive meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Boot Miller (Timothy Olyphant) makes him so angry that Brian breaks free from the hold of two men, steals a jeep and flees the military base.

Of course, this makes for quite a crisis. Steve is very opposed to what Brian has done; not only has Brian stolen Steve's jeep, Steve honestly believes that they must serve in the military until they are no longer wanted for any purpose at all. This creates plenty of tension between Steve and Brian; and there's more tension, too, between Steve and his girlfriend Michelle (Abbie Cornish). Michelle wants to marry Steve; she's tired of him telling her it'll only be ""one more year"" before he leaves the military and they can get married. Things gets even more intense when Brian's parents Roy and Ida (Ciarn Hinds and Linda Emond) are determined to protect Brian; the last thing they want is for their son to risk his life all over again in combat for many months or even longer.

I could tell you so much more; but that would start to spoil it for you. Believe it or not, there's plenty more to the plot--I certainly haven't given it all away! Suffice it to say that Michelle tries to help Brian escape to safe ground while he's AWOL and not yet caught by police and military brass who are looking for Brian in just about every nook and cranny.

Stop-Loss is not a film for small children; there's a fair amount of violence and the filmmakers pull no punches when it comes to portraying the horrible effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Nevertheless, this movie just might make you think even if you don't agree with the message of the film. These actors portray their characters as being truly human and that's terrific. I recommend this film for anyone who wants to explore the controversial ""stop-loss"" military program as well PTSD. Fans of the actors will want this movie for their collections; and people who like dramas that focus on social issues or military life will not be disappointed.",1293753600,3,3998,4.820699708454811
3108038,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Phillippe -someone has been browsing my wetdream files.  Besides the eyecandy, this is a really good movie about three guys who served in Iraq (I think it was Iraq) and one of them got Stop-Lossed, Ryan Phillippe was done with his tour of duty and something flipped when he got recalled.  He was about go awhol, but well... see the movie. Its really good.

Joseph Gordon Levitt, (give me a minute while I swoon) I met him at valley college years ago, and have been in love IN LOVE with him ever since, he is a really cool and down to earth guy. OMG,my heart is beating really fast.  I need an asprin.  OK, Im good.  Joe, is a troubled military guy who cant seem to control both his violence and his temper.  He is having a really tough time readjusting to life away from the battle field, and it just gets to the point where his friends see him traveling down and very dangerous road.

Finally, Channing Tatum, man this guy is so awsome.  I mean, he is just cool, just smooth, just... NE Way.  He is experiencing problems with flashbacks and bad dreams, but he is a dedicated soldier and returns to the call of duty.  You get a nice little troubling scene with him in his underwear -he use to be a stripper you know, damn talk about a once in a lifetime opportunity.

What annoyed me was the terminology and title. This wasn't a stop loss. It was a presidential mandate. Two different animals. LOVE the movie, but knowing what it means to have friends that want to get out but their career field is stop lossed, its just different. I think they gave an inaccurate picture of what its really like. In MY life, if my husband was stop lossed because of presidential mandate, I would be PROUD because it meant that he could do his job SO well that he was chosen specifically to continue that job. that it was an asset to the military, not just there to fulfill a contract. Still love the movie though. Gave a more real perspective that the average civilian didn't know existed.

3108040,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Your views on the Iraq War will have a definite impact on whether or not you like this film.  If you are against the U.S. involvement, then the plight of the main characters will move you because you can blame the government for destroying young lives, and probably love the film.  If you support the war, then you will want Sgt. King (Ryan Phillippe's character) captured and court-martialed. Since that doesn't happen, you will probably hate the film. Either way, this film will bring out the emotions.

The film has four weaknesses. First, we don't know the motivations behind King's decision, and I don't think the viewer was supposed to guess.  Was it fear, was it guilt, was it selfishness, was it because he felt duped, was it all four?

Second, King visits the parents of deceased soldiers and visits one who is severly wounded, but will live.  I thought this was gratuitous, and the subliminal message these scenes conveyed was that U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan is wrong.

Third, King going AWOL seemed a contrived way of him visiting the families of deceased soldiers and his friend at the VA hospital.

Fourth, the main theme of the film is the political message, so the context which is was presented around, such as the adjusting to life, the other soldiers who didn't get stop-lossed got ignored.

That said, the strength of the film was in the performances. I think Ryan Phillippe is one of the most underrated actors around today.  I dare say, he is the James Cagney or Robert De Niro of his generation. I did have issues with this character's motivation, but I connected with him nevertheless. Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt both gave strong performances, which led to a weakness of the film; I wanted to see more of their characters, and their stories. And Victor Rasuk, in a small role, also connected with me. Despite the underlying message, I thought the ""sad scenes"" with the family and hospital visits were touching.

The dvd also has some extras which add value to the film, ie, if I saw it in the theatres, I'd have given it a three.  The deleted scenes answers some questions I had about the plot, and the making of and the day in boot camp were also informative.",1276214400,,2210,4.696891191709844

The acting was extraordinary from the three main soldiers, most notably Ryan Philippe who is so gritty and real in his performance that he seems like he actually is a marine. Channing Tatum gives a genuine performance, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt's is the most haunting of the trio as a soldier who fights his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with excessive amounts of booze and slowly slips into a deep hole of despair. This is such emotionally powerful, deeply moving movie.",1265932800,,871,4.8133333333333335
3108073,4,B0013FSL1Q,"""Stop-Loss"" is one of those films that divides its audience.  Some will look at it and be appalled at its portrayal of our soldiers as people with troubles; others will applaud its attempt (not quite successful, but laudable nonetheless) to humanize our men and women of uniform.  The film is emotional and honest; honesty is often disturbing, and ""Stop-Loss"" (especially with its opening scenes) isn't a film for everyone.

Honesty isn't everything, however, and ""Stop-Loss"" does have its problems.  The film deals with cliches; this is, obviously, a Hollywood necessity, but it does suggest that all returning Iraq veterans suffer PTSD, which of course isn't true; smart film-goers will figure this out for themselves, but it is kind of annoying to see an otherwise-solid film bordering on stereotyping.  And also, the second-half of the film isn't quite as gripping as the first; Phillippe is a great actor (and no, I never thought I would say that; but it's true), but the real dynamic of the film comes from the interaction of our four protagonists: returning vets Brandon (Phillippe), Steve (Channing Tatum, surprisingly good for a change), and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, reliable as always); and Steve's fiancee, Michelle (Abbie Cornish, a wonder).  When Brandon gets stop-lossed (meaning, even though he's finished his tour, they're sending him back), he goes AWOL, taking Michelle with him.  It's here that the film slowly begins to unravel; we care more about the interaction between the four than we do Brandon's individual plight, and the film grows stronger near the end, when the four are (kind of, and don't worry, no spoilers) reunited.

There's a message in ""Stop-Loss,"" of course; it is an anti-war film in the vein of great anti-war statements: it isn't in-your-face.  Subtlety is the name of the game here, and director Kimberly Pierce more or less pulls that off (except towards the end).  But the film, ultimately, doesn't really go anywhere; it doesn't get as deep as we want it to.  The script is solid, the directing is good, and the acting is fantastic; but the movie isn't quite the sum of its parts, and comes off as something less than what it should have been.  It's still recommendable viewing, however, and serves as one of the more intelligent anti-Iraq War films to come out lately.

3108082,2,B0013FSL1Q,"Ryan Phillippe is Staff Sergeant Brandon King, the leader of a battalion fighting in a small town in Iraq.  One day, the battalion is attacked by some Iraqis in a taxicab, and King and his men chase after the culprits.  The chase ends in an alleyway, where they pursue on foot.  Unfortunately, they are ambushed and several of King's men are killed.  We then flash forward to King and some of his pals going back home to Texas for leave.  Some of them, including King, will be released, and they talk about their plans....and get drunk and fight and play with guns.  These men don't seem very stable, although some of it may be related to the flashbacks they have to the atrocities in Iraq.  Their leave draws to a close, and King goes back to base for one final check-in, anticipating that he will soon be a civilian.  However, when he tries to check-out, he's informed by a random bureaucrat that he has to go back to Iraq - he's been stop-lossed.  King is outraged, punches out a few soldiers, and hightails it home.  The rest of the movie progresses from there.

""Stop-Loss"" starts off very strong and builds some nice characterizations, but really takes a chance by having the protagonist take on a less than heroic stance.  I suspect that some people cheered his actions; after all, the Iraq war is very unpopular and seen as unjust by many people.  However, it was never clear to me why King was so upset about his stop-loss.  Was he afraid of getting killed (he mentioned this a few times), was he suffering from PTSD and needed help (perhaps), or was he just mad that he wasn't informed earlier (seems so)?  With such murky intentions, the character comes off as unlikeable and petulant at times.  This problem made his journey far less impactful than it should have been, even when he meets with one of his former battalion members who was severely injured.  Also, as others here have mentioned, it just didn't seem realistic that he was told at such a late time that he was stop-lossed.  This detail and a few other issues again really impacted the movie for me.  Ryan Phillippe also gives a bland performance, which further dilutes the message and emotional impact.  His accent at times is so heavy it's hard to understand him and then it's nearly gone at other times.  What starts off as a powerful examination of war and its effects ends up a total mess - what a shame.",1228608000,11,2383,4.546948356807512
3108103,3,B0013FSL1Q,"How you feel about this movie will depend on how you feel about the invasion and occupation of Iraq in the first place.  I've been reading 1-star reviews by pro-military people, including active duty soldiers saying, ""These guys are cowards. If you volunteer, you're giving your life to the military, so do your duty.""  And 4-star reviews by people who are against the war, saying StopLoss captures the heartbreak and trauma this war has caused.

I know this movie isn't particularly accurate, but I still think it's  strong. From the point of view of most of the world, this is a movie about the bad guys. These soldiers are people who, because of cultural and economic pressure, joined the military thinking they were protecting their country. But the military (and the whole government) were controlled by war criminals.

They were sent into a battle that had nothing to do with 9/11. It was the product of leaders who wanted to conquer the world. They were betrayed into becoming the Imperial Storm Troopers from Star Wars. And when they try to get out, they are stop-lossed and sent back.

I know a lot of soldiers will strongly disagree (although I know some who agree just as strongly.) I know most soldiers try to do the right thing. But you can't do right when you're put into a situation where there is no right, in a country where you were never wanted.  I think Stop Loss captures their helplessness very well.

I only wish the movie makers had mentioned the possibility of refusing orders and doing your time, instead of running away or going back. Of soldiers who have refused to return, almost nobody has had to do more than a year. IMO, that's better than facing death or PTSD, or becoming a war criminal.

3108105,5,B0013FSL1Q,"How decent, brave, fairly naive kids get taken advantage of, is what this film invites us to think about. It is more a film about the psychological casualties of war stateside than about battle in Iraq. There is just enough battle to show why kids might have bad dreams and family problems when they get home, and so those scenes were necessarily condensed. This may be somewhat unrealistic, and certainly not representative for all soldiers, much as Jarhead may be not representative of everyone with regard to the boredom side of being in the military.

I do think absolutely that we should honor men and women who enlist with their eyes wide open. But many kids tend to have their eyes wide shut and the system too often takes advantage of this. This has been explored in many films. Gallipoli is one of my favorites. In Stop Loss as in the Australian film Gallipoli the kids were rather simple boys. Stop Loss deals with more or less beer-drinking small-town rural kids who are basically robust and any disillusionment does not come to the surface on the battlefield, although they are getting some kind of wake-up but they are tough and adaptable and it stays within.

The serious psychological conflicts erupt when they get back home for awhile. I think that the acting here of conflicted youth and the different individual ways of handling it (or not) is really great and the best feature of the film. Statistically sure not every soldier experiences post traumatic stress and/or family problems - but the point is that when it does happen, and it surely does! -- it can take many forms from subtle to quite overt.

It is easier to remember the dead than the damaged. I find it offensive that we honor the dead as heroes and too often treat the psychologically damaged as though they are not full human beings but rather ""weak,"" or ""cowards,"" or ""misfits."" In this particular war we even seem to try to keep the physically damaged soldiers out of the public mind, and bring the dead back quietly to keep the coffins away from the media.

Maybe this is the price of an all volunteer army, to keep the unpleasant stuff out of sight so that those kids who are naive will enlist with their eyes wide shut. Stop Loss offers kids an opportunity to think through some of the unpleasant things of which they may be unaware.

But even for an older person like me I think the film was a very well done fictional exploration of some of the home front realities of wars and of the War in Iraq in particular.",1224720000,2,2502,4.575892857142857

3108107,4,B0013FSL1Q,"""Stop-Loss,"" the second feature film directed by Kimberly Peirce, focuses on a group of army buddies.  We see them in a fire fight in Tikrit, Iraq that leaves several in their squad either dead or severely injured.

Their leader, Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe), is thrilled to complete his tour of duty and return to his Texas hometown.  There, he is greeted as a hero, decorated with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, and told by his senator to look him up in Washington if he needs anything.  Civilian life is looking good to Brandon when he is unexpectedly ordered back to Iraq, or stop-lossed.

Outraged at the army's failure to fulfill its part of his contract, Brandon decides to fight the order.  Instead of going back to base, he goes to Washington to seek the help of the senator.  But because he is AWOL, the senator will not see him.  He has become a fugitive, with both military and local police looking for him.

This is the first film about Iraq to really engage the viewer.  ""Rendition,"" ""Redacted,"" and ""Lions for Lambs"" were more preachy than entertaining, and never attracted large audiences.  ""Stop-Loss"" is a far more personal look at the human dimension of one policy, rather than an outright condemnation of the war. Brandon and his pals Steve (Channing Tatum), Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Rico (Victor Rasuk) are good soldiers. They do their duty, facing danger at every turn without complaint. In fact, Steve objects when he learns that Brandon is going against orders to fight a system he feels is unjust.  Brandon refers to the stop-loss policy as a back-door draft -- keeping soldiers after their contracts are up because recruitment is down and every one is needed to fight in either Iraq or Afghanistan.

At first, Peirce wanted to make a documentary about the stop-loss policy and interviewed some actual soldiers, but eventually settled on this fictional film using stop-loss as its key plot point.  She may have been too ambitious in telling Brandon's story and intercutting it with Tommy's self-destructive alcoholism and Steve's shaky relationship with his girlfriend, Michele (Amy Cornish).  Earlier films, such as ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home,"" have dealt with post-war trauma of returning soldiers, so the scenes involving Tommy and Steve are pretty predictable.  Phillippe is a fine actor who is just now getting larger roles in films.  He was excellent in both ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Breach,"" and now adds another exceptional performance with ""Stop-Loss.""  With a believable Texas twang, his Brandon registers as a regular guy who has become an excellent soldier.  He would no more think of disobeying an order than juggling scorpions.  He is respectful, honest, obedient, and courageous.  But he never comes across as a goody-goody.  He enjoys kicking back a few beers and raising hell on Saturday night with his pals.  So his Everyman is a guy we look up to.  When he decides to go AWOL, it is both dramatic and shocking.  Phillippe portrays Brandon not as a guy who wants to run.  His first instinct is to right an injustice, but the army, politics, and bureaucracy conspire against him.

The film has great strengths.  The opening sequence, beautifully staged and edited, shows Brandon in Iraq leading his men into what turns out to be an ambush.  We get a real feel for the fear that soldiers deployed in Iraq must undergo.  Trapped in a narrow alley, their vehicle and heavy machine gun destroyed, they have to battle gunfire from the roofs on both sides of the street, sheltering in strange buildings where death can wait at every turn.  These scenes rank with the most realistic movie battle scenes.

Another strong scene is Brandon's visit to Rico in a veteran's hospital.  Rico is severely disabled from the ambush in Iraq, yet retains his sense of humor and optimism.  As squad leader, Brandon feels responsibility for Rico's condition, yet is helpless to do more than pay him a visit and offer encouragement.  Rasuk, first seen on screen five years ago in ""Raising Victor Vargas,"" is a natural actor with great charm.  His small role and one memorable scene add resonance to the story, contrasting Rico's constructive attitude with Tommy's inability to get a grip on civilian life.

I was happy to see that Peirce avoided typical pitfalls.  A road trip Brandon takes with Michele, for example, remains just that, with no romantic complications.  The relationship between Brandon and his buddy's girlfriend is not typical Hollywood, and that's precisely why it rings true. ""Stop-Loss,"" rated R, is both the engaging story of one soldier trapped by an unfair, desperate practice, and a cautionary tale of how government policy can betray those who fight our wars.",1222300800,4,4733,4.935524652338811

The camera effects in the first act are a little distracting at times, and the road trip in the second act is stretched a bit longer than necessary, but well-deserved kudos to Kimberly Peirce for shining a light on an underreported aspect of the war and taking a nuanced shades of gray approach to her subject -- the Stop Loss policy itself is bad enough, there's no need to offer bad guy caricatures -- and going with the only ending that made sense.

Yes, there are politics about the war that the film addresses.  The film reflects that war is an awful experience.  Our fighting men and women are put into hellish circumstances that no father nor mother would wish on their children, but which world events prove necessary.  In a democracy such as ours, the people can change course or stay the course on Election Day.  I don't think you can fault the President for doing what he feels is appropriate or the soldiers who fight the war.  The ultimate responsibility is with the American people.  Ultimately this conflict is their choice IMHO.  However, ""Stop-Loss"" is not politics.  It deals in an artful manner with the consequences of war.  It does it honestly, even-handedly & with some excellent acting talent.  The DVD extra deleted scenes were interesting to watch.  The ending did not seem to fit the rest of the film, however.

But I could be wrong - maybe the Army is that cold blooded. Other than that, this movie was solid although it could have done without the requisite bar scenes, and the movie lost continuity when it shifted twice during critical scenes back to the secondary stories of those who were not impacted by the stop loss.

""Stop-Loss"" is a movie, not so much about war, as it is about survival once our soldiers are home. How to cope with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? The film shows several examples. When astronauts are returned home, they are decompressed concerning their experiences. When prisoners of war are returned home, they, too, are decompressed, but soldiers from battle on leave? In this film, their commander advises them ""not to have sex with anyone underage or hit their wives or children.""

This is the story of Team Leader Brandon King (strongly played by Ryan Phillipe), a native of Brazos, Texas, who shortly after a failed firefight and unnecessary loss of men, returns home on leave, along with the other men in his company, to see several of his men become unglued.

When he tries to ""out-process"" himself and his military gear from active duty, he learns at the 24th hour that he has been Stop-Lossed, or his active duty time involuntarily extended for another tour of duty in Iraq. Why? Because men like him (with experience) are needed in a non-draft military. In contested cases the Army always wins because of contract loopholes in time of war. In other words, a ""back-draft"" is activated, placing experienced veterans ""back"" in a war environment.

The second half of the movie concerns King's reaction and actions toward what he finds as a grossly unfair Stop-Loss command. The path he takes or doesn't take is not so much the question as the question is: How fair is it for the government to assume control of a soldier about to be released from active duty, then use him for its own needs, and, as officials deem it, a necessity in time of war.

King sees a major option open to him: Go to Washington to see his local, supportive senator to find a way out of his situation. Other options: Leave the country as a deserter with new identity, knowing he can never go home again, or return to the service and Iraq and clear his name.

The paths King takes and choices he makes are heartbreaking and devastating. But I also found Stop-Loss morally reprehensible as military action that is both legal and binding without consideration for the individual soldier. In time of war the military has the presumptive right over the individual, but this is a war that President Bush legally declared ended.

In the final analysis, in a Stop-Loss action, the soldier must relinquish his individual rights, whether through desertion or in submission to duty. ""Stop-Loss"" becomes almost a documentary of Sgt. King's path through the quagmire of Stop-Loss.",1218931200,2,2803,4.876050420168068

3108139,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Hollywood has been having a hard time capturing the American post-9/11 experience, some films like ""Lions For Lambs"" are muddled political commentaries. Documentaries have done much better capturing the Iraq experience, especially ""Operation Homecoming"" and ""Taxi To The Dark Side."" Kimberly Peirce's ""Stop-Loss"" is one of the best dramatic efforts about Iraq yet produced, it has a lighter heart than the dark ""In The Valley Of Elah"" and makes a better effort at trying to understand the situation of soldiers returning from the front. It captures one particular phenomenon, I doubt Peirce meant this as a commentary on all Iraq war veterans in general, and no film could possibly capture the entire scope of the wartime experience in just an hour and forty-five minutes.

""Stop-Loss"" follows a group of small-town Texan soldiers returning from Iraq after brutal urban combat experiences. The film wonderfully captures the atmosphere and people of rural Texas with settings that feel completely authentic. The soldiers themselves are well-written, the screenply by Mark Richard and Kimberly Peirce create a gang of friends we grow to care about. They don't feel like cardboard recycles of previous films but like real young men experiencing traumatic events. Ryan Phillippe is especially convincing in his performance and loses himself in tone, accent and attitude. He's a long way from the kid we first met in films like ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""54.""

Peirce manages to create a film that mixes powerful drama with political commentary and visceral action. The scenes in Iraq are sharp and well-done, never evoking the morbid adrenaline of ""Rambo,"" instead she captures the confusion and raw reality of combat. Some will cringe or complain over the sight of Iraqi civilians being killed, but such is the reality of what is happening, those who disagree are welcome to put the film aside. The political angle of the film is well-handled, it is obvious this is an anti-war movie, but it also doesn't feel like a sermon. Peirce lets the characters, events and situations express the politics, it isn't like ""Lions For Lambs,"" which was literally just a discussion put on film. Here a character chooses to run, and the story follows his journey with intensity and emotion. Through simple, realistic moments of doubt, compassion and unity, Peirce expresses ideas about how our soldiers are being treated by the system, and without raising banners makes important questions about the nature of the war itself. This isn't a Michael Moore film, but it is an intelligent film that forces the audience to consider ideas and opinions as they are entertained by the main character's intense, uncertain quest.

There is some controversy generated over the film's main focus, the issue of ""stop-losses"" in the military where soldiers are forced to recycle service in Iraq or Afghanistan. Does it happen? According to official records it does. Does it happen exactly as in the movie? Maybe not, but keep in mind that films are forced to condense information for the sake of time and drama. Those who have questions should simply look-up any news or scholarship on the subject. Others are also angry at the depictions of soldiers coming back scarred from war, with serious emotional problems. Again, Peirce is not saying this is the ENTIRE experience for soldiers, her film is focusing on this particular, well-documented side of what soldiers returning from Iraq are going through.

""Stop-Loss"" is a moving, heartfelt picture, and yet the controversy expressed by some reviews should be expected. This is one of those special films that has important things to say in the age of commercialism, where issues like war and violence are reduced to cartoon junk food like ""Transformers"" or ""Rambo."" This is a film about people who have experienced a war and must deal with the aftermath. It is in the same league as previous statements in previous times like ""Johnny Got His Gun"" or ""Born On The Fourth Of July."" It does not dishonor the troops, on the contrary, it is speaking for those who's conscience is making them think. A previous reviewer mentions that we have a volunteer army, this is true, and because our men in uniform have chosen to defend our country they deserve better than being sent to fight a war without reason, for imperialism and oil. These are conclusions I drew, you may draw different ones.",1216339200,,4397,5.0523415977961434

I see MTV produced it and I think they wasted too much time trying to be hip with video collages and rap music at the beginning (and later at the end).  They also did not include enough ""bonding"" time to introduce the soldiers they were going to track with the audience so you would care more deeply about their predicament.  They should have patterned it after ""The Boys in Company C"" but ended up producing a story that stumbled along uncertainly from one character crisis to the next.  The scenes of the mangled soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital were moving but would have been more so if the character of the patient that served with the central character had been more developed.  I notice Ciaran Hinds played the father but wasn't given much to work with either.  Too bad really, since the point of the film needed to be made stridently.",1215907200,5,980,4.508474576271187

Brandon believes that he is wrapping up his military career when he gets an unpleasant surprise:  he has been stop-lossed.  Unfortunately, due to the shortage of service members, the government has decreed that his contract with them be extended, thus making his eligible to be sent back to the Middle East for another tour.  Brandon is eager to fight this, even if it means going AWOL and risking a prison sentence to find a Washington official to help him.
  I think this film is extremely underrated and should have garnered more attention, especially for Cornish and Phillippe.

3108142,4,B0013FSL1Q,"The title of this film STOP-LOSS may puzzle many.  According to Wikipedia, 'Stop-loss, in the United States military, is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date. It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station (PCS) move for a member still in military service'.  According to writer (with Mark Richard)/director Kimberly Pierce (whose previous 'Boy's Don't Cry' tackled similarly volatile issues), the impetus for making this film about the effects of war on veterans returning home was her viewing of videos taken by soldiers while actively engaged in battle in Iraq: this is the first war where the soldiers have actually photographed their own experiences, documenting the realities/horrors of war on the now popular video equipment at their disposal.  It is a solid idea for a film, but somehow the idea gets diluted in the script.

Texas homeboys who have just returned from the Iraq war are greeted with a parade and medals and empty rhetoric, but find adapting to reentry into their native land is fraught with the deeply embedded mental wounds of their experience: interpersonal relationships fall apart, families face altered personalities in their sons, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome reigns.  Brandon (Ryan Phillippe) blames himself for the deaths of his men, Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drinks himself toward suicide, Rico (Victor Rasuk) attempts to see past his traumatically missing limbs, Isaac (Rob Brown) finds his entire world out of focus, and Steve (Channing Tatum) sees the military as his only point of reality to a life of success.  When Brandon receives his Stop-Loss instead of his discharge papers his world turns upside down and he flounders in his nightmares and his need for escape to Canada or Mexico with his friend Michelle (Abbie Cornish).  The horror of events that follow the homecoming of these damaged soldiers culminates in a tragedy that somehow results in the soldiers following the orders of the governmental Stop-Loss orders.  And that is the worst tragedy.

Though the message is important, the delivery of it gets hazy: the motivations of the characters are too loosely defined to convince us of their terrible plights.  But the impact on the public should be a wake-up call on the extended damage of war - any war- on the men and women who experience it first hand and carry the mental scars for life.  For that reason, if for no other, this is a film that should be seen.  Grady Harp, July 08",1215561600,7,2594,5.020979020979021
3108173,2,B0013FSL1Q,"I am not a professional critic of any sort by any means, but after watching the movie and reading some of these reviews, I will say that my review is as professional and ""accurate"" as it gets. I am a Soldier amongst thousands, who has experienced these parts, as 'acted' out in the film, in reality, and what you see and experience in the film are not so and are far fetch. From the most ridiculous setup of a hasty checkpoint to the suicidal pursuit of the insurgents upon their attack (into an easily predicted ambush in a random small alley, at that) in the opening scenes. The Soldiers are equipped with ISR's (internal squad radios), and yet they yell at each other in an insurgent infested building when one Soldier is wounded...Then you have the main character (SSG King) who gets ""individually"" stop-lossed on his very last day of clearing, only to report, with another unit, back to Iraq... In the midst of this, the movie portrays that just about every Soldier who has just returned home, to include SSG King, as having the worse PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) possible, leading to one fellow Soldier's suicide. Due to this PTSD, King, at one point in the movie, notices his car has been broken into and items have been stolen; at which point, he so very easily locates the perpetrators in a nearby alley (3 that I recall, armed with a handgun) and has a severe flashback of Iraq leading him to defeat these 3 thieves. Also, once King has been informed of this stop-loss, he reports directly to his LTC, superseding an unseen and unknown NCO support channel and Chain of Command. It's all bogus.

There were many things that were Very inaccurate in this movie and I think it is the wrong way to go about Honoring America's Military. Stop-loss is real. I have experienced it myself as I was in the middle of a PCS (permanent change of station), with my family to another Overseas assignment, only to be kept at my current station for 3 months leading into me deploying. It can be very inconveniencing, but not anything like it is portrayed in the film. I was not stop-lossed as an individual or as a small group for that matter. My entire Division was stop-lossed and stop-moved. I will also say that no Soldier, or Division or Unit even, will ever get stop-lossed directly after a Combat tour anywhere to be directed to report back to Combat effective immediately. That is not to say that a Soldier will not see another Combat tour during the Stop-loss cycle however. Combat sucks, especially for those who have endured it themselves, especially on more than one occasion, and even more so for the families who have suffered the Ultimate Sacrifice. Today's Army is an ALL volunteer force and Soldier's should be well aware of what their specific job within the Army entails them to do and the commitment they hold.

Soldiers do go through MANY hardships. More than any person who has not experienced the Army or Military life themselves, will EVER know. Soldiers do fight everyday in many locations and some do pay the Ultimate Sacrifice. Soldiers do get stop-lossed, but will not quit, give up, and then go AWOL when it happens. They will complain and get disgruntle over it, more than likely, but those same Soldiers will, as we say, ""suck it up and drive on."" Many Soldiers do have and will get PTSD, but will experience and deal with it in their own ways. Families will be happy when their loved ones return and indescribable when they don't... These things happen in reality, both good and bad and this movie is a piss poor example of how Soldiers live their lives and how the Army works. If you are going to make a movie to Honor Soldiers, their families and their sacrifices, don't make the movie about ONE Soldier who gets stop-lossed as an individual to report back to Iraq specifically, 2 weeks after returning home and then have that Soldier RUN away and go AWOL in rage. Films like ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" are films that Honor our Soldiers and give the civilian people a little taste of what a Soldier endures. Not this. I have yet to see any movie that accurately portrays the Soldiers today in Iraq and Afghanistan and the hardships they and their families endure, and honestly I don't wish to see a ""movie"" that does so. However, if a movie is going to be made, I would rather see that than what this movie did portray. Although many Soldiers have been through more than anyone can imagine, true Soldiers do not quit and run away from anything.

Yeah, people get stop lossed. When I VOLUNTEERED to come to Iraq, I knew that I was going to get stop lossed MONTHS in advance.

3108177,4,B0013FSL1Q,"STOP LOSS is a film with many virtues, especially its raw and rushed look by the great Chris Menges, but it hasn't much of a screenplay and some of the boys-only sequences leave audiences wondering how Kim Peirce thinks men spend their time together.  Ryan Phillipe has always found peace at the ranch, it's been a safe place, but now it's become a place of danger now that he is AWOL or whatever.  This ranch place is a couple of shacks hardly fit for dogs to live in, but the imaginary Texas boys of Peirce's screenplay slobber all over it like lt's the Grand Hilton of boy fun.  They shoot off dozens of rifles and handguns and kill them some wild animals.  I get it, it's sort of like Iraq, but it made me start thinking, maybe Iraq would be more fun for these boys if they could do the kind of uninhibited drinking they do out at their forty acre ranch.  Australian starlet Abbie Cornish seems to have prepared for her part as the girl next door by watching reel after reel of old LBJ press conferences, and her West Texas accent is startlingly good, if a little, well, brusque.  Any moment I expected her to pick up a beagle by its ears and swing it around.

You know what it's like, the hunting sequences in Vincente Minnelli's HOME FROM THE HILL.  I expect Minnelli had even less experience that Peirce being out on a weeklong fox hunt with a pack of drink-crazed good ol boys, but he brought an imagined, Bacchic frenzy to such sequences, amped up the red filter playing off the barbeque flames, and it paid off for him.  In each case, the director's fascination with masculinity makes film fairly pop with color and sweat.  Minnelli probably wished from his grave, that it had been he who had captured that shot of a drunken Channing Tatum, wearing only a pair of insanely tight, sultry and shiny Calvin Kleins, digging himself into a makeshift grave in his own front garden, cowering in the headlights of a car, crying and turning his own body into a Pieta.",1208995200,3,1968,4.456824512534819

On the day he is to be honorably discharged from the service, decorated army Sergeant Brandon King is ordered to return to duty in Iraq, the latest victim of ""stop-loss,"" a term for when soldiers who have fulfilled the terms of their military contract are denied permission to leave the service under penalty of court martial and imprisonment.  Brandon, caught emotionally off-guard by the news, impulsively decides to go AWOL, leaving his fellow troops to head back to the Middle East without him.  Brandon becomes a fugitive from justice, as much on the run from the memories that haunt him as from the authorities looking to bring him back.

A searing expose on the ""backdoor draft,"" ""Stop-Loss"" is an extraordinarily powerful drama that shows how men and women who have bravely served their country on the field of battle (along with the loved ones they have left behind) are being betrayed by the very government they fought to defend.  Yet, ""Stop-Loss"" is no star-turn polemic like ""Lions for Lambs,"" but, rather, an intensely personal drama that illuminates its issue in starkly human terms.  The grim realities of post-war trauma - both physical and psychological - are vividly dramatized in the persons of Brandon and his buddies, all of whom have returned to their small Texas town radically changed men.  But the film is also about that special sense of camaraderie and group cohesion that develops among soldiers who have fought side by side under hellish circumstances - and the lifelong bond that results.

Despite the wide-ranging nature of the theme, writer/director Kimberley (""Boys Don't Cry"") Peirce and co-writer Mark Richard keep the drama modest in scope and intimate in scale.  It's true that there are times when the screenplay threatens to fall victim to its own contrivance, but the quality of performance and authenticity of detail always bring the movie back into line.

Long a fine but under-appreciated actor, Ryan Philippe truly comes into his own in this film, delivering a performance of such raw truth and emotional complexity that we literally cannot take our eyes off him for the duration of the movie.  Ditto for Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Victor Rasuk, all equally superb as men who served alongside Brandon in Iraq and who now have their own personal, war-related demons to wage battle against.  Abbie Cornish is also excellent as the friend who accompanies Brandon on his panic-stricken flight across the country.

There are those who will object to ""Stop-Loss"" on strictly political grounds, seeing it as yet another anti-war diatribe designed to make the Bush administration look bad.  Yet, the film transcends politics, honoring the bravery and valor of the soldiers while reserving the right to question the wisdom and morality of those in power who would send these fine young men on such a fool's errand in the first place - and then insist on doing it over and over again.  I frankly can't imagine anything more pro-American or pro-troop than that.",1207958400,4,3018,5.032128514056225
3108179,4,B0013FSL1Q,"""Stop-loss"" is a term coined by the government for a particularly cruel practice, namely the arbitrary rescinding of a soldier's exit from the war theater. Supposedly only employable in times of war, it has been used during the Iraq-Afghani conflict to maintain strong numbers of troops in high-risk areas. The soldier, apparently, has no warning of the fact that he is stop-lossed until processing his papers to get out and go home. This, at least, is what happens to the protagonist in this movie.

The film does not dwell on the battles in Iraq, although it begins there, introducing us to a bunch of good-old-boy young men from the same small town in Texas, who have been together for a long time in Iraq and are used to thinking as a unit and looking out for each other. It shows them during the excruciating boredom of down-time, and then leads us through a terrible encounter in the crowded, narrow streets of a town in Iraq, skirmishing with snipers and terrorists, and leaves nothing to the imagination about the cruelties of war.

Shortly thereafter, it shows the boys coming home, for what they think is for good. Ryan Phillippe, in a strong performance as the sergeant of the unit, is broadsided by the news that he is being almost immediately shipped back to Iraq, and he understandably protests vehemently. His superior, considering him a flight risk by his demeanour, orders him escorted to the stockade, and in a chance moment of opportunity while being marched to transport, he disables his guards and escapes.

His plan after his escape is to take the unfairness and seeming illegality of his enforced reenlistment straight to some politician who can effect change, but one feels from the start that it is a bit like the mouse that roared; government is government, and is impervious to chiding from a nonentity like an inconvenienced soldier. His efforts are altruistic; he is not trying to bring justice just for himself, but for all the soldiers who come home expecting to get married, take a job as a car salesman, and try to forget the horrors of war. It's plain, however, that he is up against an immovable force.

There have been some strong, well-acted, and well-presented films of late on the Iraq conflict and/or its effect on the young people who go there believing, no doubt, that they can make a difference. Certainly some difference is made, but the toll it takes on the psyches of those in conflict is dire and sad. I grew up during the Viet Nam War, and do not profess to know the extent of damage that conflict made on those involved - heavy, I know - but war is war, and no one involved emerges unscathed, I am sure. It is made clear in Stop-Loss that idealism is quickly stripped away, and despair becomes endemic.

Strongly acted by all participants, and Ryan Phillippe in particular deserves kudos.",1207785600,5,2837,4.723232323232323
3108180,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Kimberly Pierce's last movie was ""Boys Don't Cry,"" starring Hilary Swank who gave a critically acclaimed performance. Now eight years later Pierce directs ""Stop-Loss, the term used to describe the military's sending soldiers back to battle when they have just finished one combat tour of duty. I am not sure what I was expecting but I got more than I bargained for as apparently did the other members of the audience from both my and their reactions. They ranged from audible sobs that began almost immediately after the film began, to groans to one man's comment sitting near me of ""damn this country."" Although I have never seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" but know of the first 20 minutes or so of the violent depiction of battle in that film, I cannot fathom, however, that it is rawer and bloodier than the first few minutes of ""Stop-Loss."" The violence and bloodshed are relentless, and the battle scenes are shot as if they were done by an amateur with a hand-held video camera.

The acting is impeccable; the cinematography --by Chris Menges-- is extraordinary. The film essentially belongs to Ryan Phillipe who plays Sgt. Brandon King-- although there are no bad performances--, recently having returned to his hometown in Texas after completing a tour of duty in Iraq where he lost several of his men. On the day that he is to have been discharged, he learns that he has been reassigned to Iraq. Rather than return to combat, he goes AWOL and does a cross-country drive to Washington with his friend Michelle played by Abbie Cornish in another first-class performance. They in their naivete initially believe that their senator will be able to help them.

I am not sure what the director wanted to achieve. Supposedly she made the movie out of anger over her brother's experience as a soldier in Iraq. If she wanted to show the horror of war, she more than accomplished her mission. The violence and the heartwrenching fate of the soldiers, both in and after combat, begin in the first frames of the film and never abate. The nadir of this movie-- although several events come close-- occurs when King, on his way to D. C., visits his forever-maimed buddy in a hospital. The soldier's optimism-- is he whistling in the dark-- in such overwhelming adversity-- will tear your heart out.

Upon leaving the theatre, I wondered if this film would have any effect on anyone. The hawks and doves probably will not change their positions on the Iraq War. On the other hand, conventional wisdom says that sometimes art does make a difference. The novel UNCLE TOM'S CABIN we are told influenced how people felt about slavery. And recently much was made by the media as to whether ""Saturday Night Live's depiction of Hillary Clinton's unfair treatment by the media with a capital ""M"" would in any way have an impact on voters.

If nothing else, this film stands for the proposition that indeed boys-- even grown men-- do cry, as evidenced both by the men in ""Stop-Loss"" and the men in the audience.",1206921600,11,2991,4.757225433526012
3108181,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Don't Cry"") brings another powerfully charged film of such raw emotion that upon later reflection of the movie I felt like I had witnessed real events.

Stop-Loss follows the fictional story of a soldier, Brandon King (Ryan Philippe), who has returned home after a tour in Iraq. His contract is up and he just about to get out when he is stop-lossed (a ""fine-print"" section in all soldiers' contracts that gives the President the power to extended soldier's contracts in time of war). He refuses to be shipped back to Iraq, and goes AWOL in search of his state's senator for help. What follows is his road trip to fight the stop-loss as well as showing the devastating affects his fellow soldiers (Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) experience from the horrible war. Its' acting, directing, and writing had such a feeling of authenticity, and combined with the fact that 81,000 of our brave soldiers have already been stop-lossed since Spetember 11,2001, this film feels like a true story.

One thing that made this film succeed so well was it's director was a woman, and she was able to make a movie were you could feel and see the emotions these guys were feeling even as they would desperately try and mask them.

The acting was extraordinary from the three main soldiers, most notably Ryan Philippe who is so gritty and real in his performance that he seems like he actually is a marine. Channing Tatum gives a genuine performance, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt's is the most haunting of the trio as a soldier who fights his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with excessive amounts of booze and slowly slips into a deep hole of despair.

This films is not a propaganda piece, it simply portrays something that is going on right now. It brings up many good points, but never bashes you with a certain viewpoint but leaves it to you to decide. This is such emotionally powerful, deeply moving film, the best film I have seen since the year started, and destined to be one of my favorites from this year.",1206835200,5,2032,4.747875354107649

By concentrating so much on the plight of one soldier (Ryan Philippe) who has been ""stop-lossed""--ordered back to Iraq without his prior knowledge and against his will--Peirce shortchanges most of the other characters in the movie. The sorrowful ending feels rushed after what has come before, and I wish she had made Philippe's commanding officer (Timothy Olyphant) less of a one-note martinet villain. Nevertheless, the film serves as a powerful brief on behalf of fighting men (and women too, though the film portrays no women soldiers) whom the military sees less as human beings than as war materiel to be deployed at its whim. Peirce makes the point emphatically that these are not wimpy draft-dodgers (there being, of course, no draft to dodge), but courageous, battle-hardened soldiers who love their country and are placed in an unendurable dilemma by the practice of stop-loss.

Many sequences of the film crackle with power and suspense, thanks partly to the superb camera work of cinematographer Chris Menges. (The early, flickering home-movie sequences of combat in Iraq are a sad, sardonic parody of current armed-forces recruiting commercials.) But what really makes ""Stop-Loss"" worth seeing is the power of the performances. Ryan Philippe--who showed greater-than-average promise in such films as ""Gosford Park"" and ""Breach""--gives his finest performance to date as the stop-lossed soldier, a man torn apart by conflicting imperatives. Channing Tatum, as his best Army buddy, and Abbie Cornish as Tatum's fiancee are equally fine. The always brilliant Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a strong impression as an alcoholic screwup who can't envision a life beyond the Army, and so does Victor Rasuk as a hideously maimed member of Philippe's squad. It's too bad that other fine actors--such as Olyphant, Ciaran Hinds as Philippe's father, Mamie Gummer as Gordon-Levitt's fiancee and Josef Sommer as a pompous senator--are consigned to glorified walk-ons. Nevertheless, Peirce has put on screen a memorable advocacy piece on behalf of the American fighting man. This film, almost by definition, will be a tough sell to audiences; I hope it finds its niche.",1206835200,4,2394,5.384
3342127,3,B0013FSL1Q,"Director Kimberly Peirce's last film was the revolutionary, emotionally-charged and truthful ""Boy's Don't Cry"" with the galvanizing performance of Hilary Swank. That was over 8 years ago and now she has returned with the Iraq War drama, `Stop-Loss"" starring a coterie of edgy, hot young actors.
Oddly enough, I think that almost all of the Iraq War based dramas like the recent ""Rendition"" have been failures at the box office which leads me to wonder, why?
Perhaps, since it is literally happening now, it is too current: the wounds are opening daily with no healing in sight. At the very least, We as Americans are conflicted about our involvement in Iraq.
Peirce has chosen to use the Iraq War as a background onto which she bases her drama with Universal themes of: Where do I fit in? Where do I belong? Do I belong?
Working here with co-writer Mark Richard, Peirce has found a subject in the way the war in Iraq is tearing apart many of its soldiers, in combat and when they return home. This is a wrenching story of men at arms who cannot find peace outside the military circle, who return to civilian life on the horrific edge of violence and despair. This point of view is of course not new, going back at least as far as William Wyler's ""The Best Year's of Our Lives"" and  Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter."" War is Hell: this we all know and can empathize with but the aftermath, the coming home, the re-adjusting to Life after War is worse.
Several actors shine here: primarily the Brandon King of Ryan Phillipe (whose stop-loss forced re-enlistment forms the backbone of this film) and the Michele of Abbie Cornish who basically steals the film from under all her hot shot male cast members with her persuasive, thoughtful and totally believable performance.
There are several scenes in ""Stop Loss"" which approach and sometimes go over the edge into hokiness but overall, this film has a real emotional life: these are characters who emote from a real place, a place that it is obvious that Peirce believes in, invests in and ultimately it is the saving grace of this flawed, yet sock-in-the-gut experience film.",1206748800,15,2124,4.725067385444744
3342128,5,B0013FSL1Q,"There are films that make you feel you wasted your time, films you leave in the middle of or at the beginning because of the lack of content, this is NOT one of them.  This film will get GREAT reviews or it will get bad ones from those that would once again vote for the guy with ""W"" as a middle name.  You will love it or hate it; there will not be a middle of the road on this one.  Let's leave the politics out of it folks, this is a film that does not pull at you, it yanks your heart right out of your chest if you have one - I left it feeling human because it moved me, and made me THINK.  President John F. Kennedy once said to 5 Nobel laureates having dinner in the White House that there had never been so much intelligence gathered at one time in this room with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dinned alone (I would have given the credit to his friend and spiritual guide John Adams but let's leave that for another day).  One of Thomas Jefferson's best known quotes - ""Those that would give up their freedoms in the name of SAFETY and SECURITY will be neither SAFE nor SECURE and certainly not free.  The current policies of this country have fed on the American obsession with our personal safety, maybe we should listen to one of our founding fathers.

Just in case those reading this think it is unpatriotic of me not to agree with violating a serviceman's contracted voluntary enlistment, my background is one of having retired after 20 years in the Air Force, as a Fighter Pilot who flew two one year combat tours in Vietnam.

Also made me think of some of the stop-loss resisters I've read about.
To those who complain about a lack of realism: no film is ever perfect in this regard.  Yes, when they chased the Arab shooters into that alley it had ambush written all over it.  Let's not pretend that no unit ever set itself up for disaster - it happens in all wars.  (One of my friends who was Special Forces in Vietnam had some insane stories about huge screwups that led to disasters like this.)  Remember the Jessica Lynch fiasco?  SNAFU from start to finish.  Few people recall that a mission to secure a key bridge was deprived of necessary support which was diverted to the ""rescue"" mission, and for that reason the unit securing the bridge suffered heavy casualties including friendly fire from aircraft.
As for the PTSD, I had adult night-school students who had served in Iraq who were totally unpredictable - you never knew which personality was going to emerge on any given night.  That stuff is real.",1481241600,,1337,4.651063829787234

3342455,4,B0013FSL1Q,"I find delicate to review this movie as a foreigner, I don't know what really happens in the USA with the order Spot-Loss and his reason or justice. But precisely, being Spanish, I have some observations to do.
The USA is today as powerful as Roman Empire 2000 years ago. I think most people around the World should agree in that. And in fact, Roman Legions fought also in the same land today known as Iraq, Lybia, Mesopotamia, Judea  or as it were.
The big differences are, until 200 years, wars and battles were separated in time by years, months or almost weeks between one to another armed engagement or combat, yes, owing to long foot marches, horses and mules, or unfinishable warship sailing. But todays war is a fight of 24 hours over 24. In the past, crucial battles as Trafalgar were fought my military men commanded at last by his respective kings, which knew each enemy king very well.
Instead todays unstoppable, continuum type of war began with First World War, and with these, many new nervous and physical sequels. Roman legionnaires had no machine guns, rockets or airplanes nor snipers rifles, and rested and sleep between battles. Surely they were very hungry, but there was ever a slight human forced stop between combats.  Yes, also the conscription were compulsory, no voluntary, for example,  in the days of the Nelson Navy, and recruitment was brutal and forced.
But the physical and sociological condition of ancient soldiers from big historical military powers was similar to these of the common civilian peasants and common people from his times: they all were poor, accustomed to a hard, short life. Of course, Julius Caesar was rich, but the supreme general ever is an exception.  However, I think in the USA of today, social differences are too much big. In this film the soldiers doesnt no seem very favored social or economically, so, I find an order as the Stop Loss is badly received to go back to a war poorly understood with high possibilities of ending killed or seriously wounded, physical and mentally.
A good film far of the false, unbelievable heroism of Rambo and similar movies and technically well achieved.",1395619200,,2151,4.821138211382114

3342485,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop-Loss is not for everyone.  While it may begin as a typical war movie with lots of shootings, bombings, explosions and the whole assortment of things you associate with a war (and done rather realistically might I add) the film soon turns into a much *much* slower-paced drama involving one of the soldiers coming home, spending time with his family and refusing to return to Iraq.  He believes he did his time and watched enough of his friends die that he shouldn't have to return, but it turns out he's being forced (hence the name of the movie- Stop-Loss means the soldier is forced to return to war due to an enlistment contract) so he spends quite a bit of his time (75% of the film) making plans on how he's going to avoid having to go back.

For us however, the viewers, he spends most of his time walking around with his friends, girlfriend and family.  Now when I mention this is a slower-paced movie, I seriously mean it- if you're not patient enough, you won't be able to stay focused.  It's *that* slow.  However, it's interesting if you're willing to make an effort to pay attention to the storyline and there's never really anything confusing that takes place.  Perhaps the film is a good 30 minutes overlong, but just be aware of its slower pace and that if you're expecting a violent and exciting war movie, you'll be disappointed.

The ending is decent at least.  A surprise.  I think most of us are expecting *that* to happen (without spoiling what it is) but... no.  Interesting conclusion there.",1371772800,,1519,4.609665427509293

3342508,1,B0013FSL1Q,"This movie had a lot going for it.  First of all, Kimberly Pierce's debut film `Boys Don't Cry' is one of the best films of the 90's and is hauntingly realistic in its approach to a taboo subject.  Pierce proved she had talent but also that she had the gravitas to carry a film of that weight with respectable intensity and honesty.  Her hands in a project of this nature should have meant something.  Then you have the cast; a who's-who of young talent.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been on the upswing for years now and he is only getting better.  Abbie Cornish is considered something special by some, and her performance in `Bright Star' was uncannily excellent.  Channing Tatum is one of those actors who oozes charisma and just draws you to him.  The weak link here is obviously Ryan Phillippe, and yet he's always been at least engaging even when he wasn't really `acting'.  Then you have the subject.  War is very tricky, especially when you are depicting a war that is so current and so fresh in the minds of millions.  This is something that cannot be taken lightly, no matter what your stand is on the matter.  Honestly, all of these elements should have come together to produce something sacred and yet...

It didn't.

From the opening segments that contain teen angst music crushing down over a series of depictions of war-like violence and soldier comradery, it becomes evident that this film isn't taking itself seriously.  It's trying to make something stylized and engaging for a typical audience; the MTV crowd.  This isn't smart fare but dumbed down to draw in an audience that doesn't know the difference.

""Cool man, Ryan Phillippe is so mad that he has to go back to Iraq, so he punched out that other soldier and went AWOL!""

""Dude, Channing Tatum would so kick Ryan Phillippe's ***!""

""Whoop, whoop, yah, let's kill some Iraqis!""

The plot breakdown feels contrived and uninspired.  They really didn't think this through enough to create something that felt realistic.  Instead, each and every situation feels disjointed and presented solely to convey a desired effect that isn't in the least bit probable.  The depictions of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder feel overdone, especially when everyone seems to suffer from the same issues.  There is no diversity and so everything feels instilled to get our sympathies up.  Some of the points are picked up and then dropped with no explanation, causing one to wonder just why they were addressed in the first place.  And then you have the whole `stop-loss' situation and the drastic measures taken by Phillippe's character, which make no sense.  On top of that, (because I understand that dramatic embellishments are necessary at times to create cinematic tension) the handling of the character arc is ridiculous.  The end is so convoluted it's embarrassing.

But that isn't the worst of it.

The character development in general is horrible.  None of these characters are the least bit interesting, and their relationships don't make sense.  They are just angry and hit each other all the time, yell and demean and criticize.  But they're best friends.  The film made our soldiers look like a bunch of hooligans who don't even begin to understand the meaning of their profession.  Say what you will about war itself (I personally don't support the idea), but there has to be honor found in order to create something human.  The approach here made the war and those involved look like a joke, and not in a profound or subjective way.  They just threw this away.

And then you have those horrid performances given but Cornish and Phillippe that just made me want to vomit.

This film is a waste, a total disgusting waste, which is sad because it had promise on paper that turn, quickly, into trash.",1318809600,3,3764,4.821875
3342509,2,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop Loss was a swing and a miss - the topic is interesting and one that hasn't received a lot of attention (soldiers required to reup).  However, for all its intentions, the movie misses the target and becomes a mess of disjointed portrayals of flashback induced psychological struggles for the main characters. Bad choices by two of the primary actors (Phillippe and Cornish) to attempt to Texas accents end up having them sound mentally deficient in Phillippe's case - or just plain unintelligible in the case of Cornish.  Cornish's performance is flat and uninteresting - a total snoozer.  Phillippe started out rather engaging and was strong in the scene where he gave an akward speeech at his home town welcome parade - however his attempts at portraying stronger emotions felt forced and over the top.  Bad directing and a poor script added to the mess of the film.  Rating is two stars because some of the supporting cast was worth watching - otherwise skip this one.",1316217600,,975,4.849397590361446
3342530,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Victor Rasuk & Abbie Cornish....
Some of the hottest and most promising of modern-day Hollywood's young actors.
About 15 minutes into this movie, I was very much enthralled by it's storyline and acting.
It's a pretty good chronicle of what today's young service men & women go through in the
ongoing Iraq conflict. Basically, after coming home to the states again, after serving admirably
in many military missions, Ryan Phillippe's character, all set to ETS, finds himself in a fix
with the very military he's served so well. They have a quite shady backdoor re-draft policy known as
a STOP-LOSS, where they can re-up soliders who have already fought, and who are about to end their
tour of duty. All of the characters are dealing with their own re-adjustment issues; Channing Tatum's
character is prone to fits of violence, and delusions that he is back in Iraq, in the heat of battle.
He finds it impossible to maintain any intimate long-lasting relationships, other than with
his war brothers. His girlfriend / fiance', played by Abbie Cornish, feels scared, helpless, and frustrated
against her boyfriend's plight, and often turns to his best friend----Yes, you got it!---Ryan Phillipe's character,
in times strife and confusion. The two form a bond/attraction, which leads to a torn-between-two-lovers
stress point later in the film. J. Gordon-Levitt's character is struggling with alcoholism.
He tries religion, but needs something more substantial than that. Sadly, solace doesn't come for him.
Victor Rasuk's character gets severely injured early on in the film, and does a very good job
playing a solider of latino descent, who is rendered helpless in the prime of his life.

To tell the truth, after awhile, Phillippe's character, (usually the pillar of strength for all his buddies),
becomes a bit ragged around the mental edges too, as he is basically rendered a fugutive / AWOL from military duty...
A situation he doesn't deserve to be in. But in a STOP-LOSS situation, this is often the case.
Without giving the movie away further, the film takes some interesting turns, and all the actors did an
excellent job in the portrayal of their roles. Like the movie, ""The Hurt Locker"", which was an Iraq-era
type of film too, but from a different perspective, ""Stop-Loss"" was directed by a female director...
Kimberly Pierce, who did a stellar job in that capacity.
Though I loved Jeremy Renner's character in ""Hurt Locker"", I didn't find the directing as tight and
refined, nor the storyline as clear and easy to follow as with ""Stop-Loss"".
To me, ""Stop-Loss"" should have been the film getting all the accolades and awards.
I must add that the themes of friendship, loyalty, loss, betrayal, duty, etc. run throughout as well.
To me, a female director always seems to interweave more emotional depth in a film.
Not that male directors can't or don't...but the women directors really excel in that area.

It's already established that Ryan Phillipe is a very good actor, but Channing Tatum should not
be slept on either!---More and more, with each role, he is proving himself to be a very credible actor.
I give this movie **5 Stars**  A Very Good Film.",1312934400,4,3215,5.01685393258427

3342533,4,B0013FSL1Q,"The first 10 minutes you're thrown into a shoot out in the middle of the Iraq War.  Civilians are killed and so are soldiers.  Three of the soldiers go back home to Texas and are welcomed with open arms.  The soldiers are played well by Ryan Phillippe, Joseph Gordon Lewitt and Channing Tatum.  Ryan Phillippe who generally doesn't tend to show all that much range in his films does so in this.  He's pretty convincing and if you're not paying attention you may not recognize him he's that absolved in the character.  He discovers after being home for a very short time that he's been stop-lossed and has to be shipped back to Iraq.  He goes AWOL and on the run.  The rest of the details I'll leave up to you to see as it is worth seeing.  It's probably not as accurate, realistic or as great as ""The Hurt Locker"", but it is good.  It's got a lot of thrown in drama.  All three of the guys seem to be experiencing severe post traumatic stress disorders from the war.  I imagine it probably does haunt many soldiers and those that see a lot of deaths, but ironic that it's all three soldiers. I guess it's all part of the movie magic.  This is a little bit of fiction and a little of bit of truth, you decide which.  This isn't another film about the Iraq War, but more a film about the ""Stop-loss policy"" which many don't know much about and should.  Many soliders are involuntarily forced to go back and serve in the war when they don't want to.  I'm sure there are those who disagree with it and find this to be inaccurate.  I just thought it was a good movie and not interested a political debate on it otherwise I'd watch a documentary on the subject.",1304467200,,1655,4.287096774193548
3342534,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop-Loss is a rather intense film that focuses on the military's ""stop-loss"" program--a practice that allows the military to re-deploy American troops back to combat duty in places like Iraq even when they have completely fulfilled their obligations by doing their complete tour of duty. The film's plot moves along well although a few minutes could have edited out to make the story a bit more gripping. The acting is extremely convincing; the choreography and cinematography enhance the movie quite a bit. The casting was excellent and the script well written, too. I should also mention that I really appreciate the input from soldiers and their families; because of them I know so much more about ""stop-loss"" than I otherwise would have if I had just watched this film. It's important to note that the filmmaker is neither truly anti-soldier nor cheering for a man who has gone AWOL, Kimberly Peirce is protesting the ""stop-loss"" program; and if you watch the movie from this perspective I think you will like it more.

When the action starts, we meet decorated Staff Sergeant Brian King (Ryan Phillippe) and some of his very good buddies including Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Sergeant Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) returning home from combat duty in Iraq. To one degree or another, they are all upset about the trauma they experienced during combat, seeing some of their best friends die and others like Private Rico Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk) terribly maimed for life, losing his sight and more than one limb. However, Brian is relieved and at least somewhat optimistic about his future because he's ""gettin' out;"" he wants to adjust to life as a civilian in his native Texas again--until, that is, he finds out from a bureaucratic cog in a wheel that he is being unexpectedly ""stop-lossed:"" he must now return to Iraq and serve even more time.  While his buddy Steve doesn't see a problem with this (Steve has been sent back, too), Brian is very disgruntled; and his brief and unproductive meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Boot Miller (Timothy Olyphant) makes him so angry that Brian breaks free from the hold of two men, steals a jeep and flees the military base.

Of course, this makes for quite a crisis. Steve is very opposed to what Brian has done; not only has Brian stolen Steve's jeep, Steve honestly believes that they must serve in the military until they are no longer wanted for any purpose at all. This creates plenty of tension between Steve and Brian; and there's more tension, too, between Steve and his girlfriend Michelle (Abbie Cornish). Michelle wants to marry Steve; she's tired of him telling her it'll only be ""one more year"" before he leaves the military and they can get married. Things gets even more intense when Brian's parents Roy and Ida (Ciarn Hinds and Linda Emond) are determined to protect Brian; the last thing they want is for their son to risk his life all over again in combat for many months or even longer.

I could tell you so much more; but that would start to spoil it for you. Believe it or not, there's plenty more to the plot--I certainly haven't given it all away! Suffice it to say that Michelle tries to help Brian escape to safe ground while he's AWOL and not yet caught by police and military brass who are looking for Brian in just about every nook and cranny.

Stop-Loss is not a film for small children; there's a fair amount of violence and the filmmakers pull no punches when it comes to portraying the horrible effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Nevertheless, this movie just might make you think even if you don't agree with the message of the film. These actors portray their characters as being truly human and that's terrific. I recommend this film for anyone who wants to explore the controversial ""stop-loss"" military program as well PTSD. Fans of the actors will want this movie for their collections; and people who like dramas that focus on social issues or military life will not be disappointed.",1293753600,3,3998,4.820699708454811
3342535,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Phillippe -someone has been browsing my wetdream files.  Besides the eyecandy, this is a really good movie about three guys who served in Iraq (I think it was Iraq) and one of them got Stop-Lossed, Ryan Phillippe was done with his tour of duty and something flipped when he got recalled.  He was about go awhol, but well... see the movie. Its really good.

Joseph Gordon Levitt, (give me a minute while I swoon) I met him at valley college years ago, and have been in love IN LOVE with him ever since, he is a really cool and down to earth guy. OMG,my heart is beating really fast.  I need an asprin.  OK, Im good.  Joe, is a troubled military guy who cant seem to control both his violence and his temper.  He is having a really tough time readjusting to life away from the battle field, and it just gets to the point where his friends see him traveling down and very dangerous road.

Finally, Channing Tatum, man this guy is so awsome.  I mean, he is just cool, just smooth, just... NE Way.  He is experiencing problems with flashbacks and bad dreams, but he is a dedicated soldier and returns to the call of duty.  You get a nice little troubling scene with him in his underwear -he use to be a stripper you know, damn talk about a once in a lifetime opportunity.

NE way, this is a really great movie, that I think will make a person respect the soldiers and what they really give up for their country.

What annoyed me was the terminology and title. This wasn't a stop loss. It was a presidential mandate. Two different animals. LOVE the movie, but knowing what it means to have friends that want to get out but their career field is stop lossed, its just different. I think they gave an inaccurate picture of what its really like. In MY life, if my husband was stop lossed because of presidential mandate, I would be PROUD because it meant that he could do his job SO well that he was chosen specifically to continue that job. that it was an asset to the military, not just there to fulfill a contract. Still love the movie though. Gave a more real perspective that the average civilian didn't know existed.

3342537,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Your views on the Iraq War will have a definite impact on whether or not you like this film.  If you are against the U.S. involvement, then the plight of the main characters will move you because you can blame the government for destroying young lives, and probably love the film.  If you support the war, then you will want Sgt. King (Ryan Phillippe's character) captured and court-martialed. Since that doesn't happen, you will probably hate the film. Either way, this film will bring out the emotions.

The film has four weaknesses. First, we don't know the motivations behind King's decision, and I don't think the viewer was supposed to guess.  Was it fear, was it guilt, was it selfishness, was it because he felt duped, was it all four?

Second, King visits the parents of deceased soldiers and visits one who is severly wounded, but will live.  I thought this was gratuitous, and the subliminal message these scenes conveyed was that U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan is wrong.

Third, King going AWOL seemed a contrived way of him visiting the families of deceased soldiers and his friend at the VA hospital.

Fourth, the main theme of the film is the political message, so the context which is was presented around, such as the adjusting to life, the other soldiers who didn't get stop-lossed got ignored.

That said, the strength of the film was in the performances. I think Ryan Phillippe is one of the most underrated actors around today.  I dare say, he is the James Cagney or Robert De Niro of his generation. I did have issues with this character's motivation, but I connected with him nevertheless. Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt both gave strong performances, which led to a weakness of the film; I wanted to see more of their characters, and their stories. And Victor Rasuk, in a small role, also connected with me. Despite the underlying message, I thought the ""sad scenes"" with the family and hospital visits were touching.

The dvd also has some extras which add value to the film, ie, if I saw it in the theatres, I'd have given it a three.  The deleted scenes answers some questions I had about the plot, and the making of and the day in boot camp were also informative.",1276214400,,2210,4.696891191709844

The acting was extraordinary from the three main soldiers, most notably Ryan Philippe who is so gritty and real in his performance that he seems like he actually is a marine.

3342570,4,B0013FSL1Q,"""Stop-Loss"" is one of those films that divides its audience.  Some will look at it and be appalled at its portrayal of our soldiers as people with troubles; others will applaud its attempt (not quite successful, but laudable nonetheless) to humanize our men and women of uniform.  The film is emotional and honest; honesty is often disturbing, and ""Stop-Loss"" (especially with its opening scenes) isn't a film for everyone.

Honesty isn't everything, however, and ""Stop-Loss"" does have its problems.  The film deals with cliches; this is, obviously, a Hollywood necessity, but it does suggest that all returning Iraq veterans suffer PTSD, which of course isn't true; smart film-goers will figure this out for themselves, but it is kind of annoying to see an otherwise-solid film bordering on stereotyping.  And also, the second-half of the film isn't quite as gripping as the first; Phillippe is a great actor (and no, I never thought I would say that; but it's true), but the real dynamic of the film comes from the interaction of our four protagonists: returning vets Brandon (Phillippe), Steve (Channing Tatum, surprisingly good for a change), and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, reliable as always); and Steve's fiancee, Michelle (Abbie Cornish, a wonder).  When Brandon gets stop-lossed (meaning, even though he's finished his tour, they're sending him back), he goes AWOL, taking Michelle with him.  It's here that the film slowly begins to unravel; we care more about the interaction between the four than we do Brandon's individual plight, and the film grows stronger near the end, when the four are (kind of, and don't worry, no spoilers) reunited.

There's a message in ""Stop-Loss,"" of course; it is an anti-war film in the vein of great anti-war statements: it isn't in-your-face.  Subtlety is the name of the game here, and director Kimberly Pierce more or less pulls that off (except towards the end).  But the film, ultimately, doesn't really go anywhere; it doesn't get as deep as we want it to.  The script is solid, the directing is good, and the acting is fantastic; but the movie isn't quite the sum of its parts, and comes off as something less than what it should have been.  It's still recommendable viewing, however, and serves as one of the more intelligent anti-Iraq War films to come out lately.

3342579,2,B0013FSL1Q,"Ryan Phillippe is Staff Sergeant Brandon King, the leader of a battalion fighting in a small town in Iraq.  One day, the battalion is attacked by some Iraqis in a taxicab, and King and his men chase after the culprits.  The chase ends in an alleyway, where they pursue on foot.  Unfortunately, they are ambushed and several of King's men are killed.  We then flash forward to King and some of his pals going back home to Texas for leave.  Some of them, including King, will be released, and they talk about their plans....and get drunk and fight and play with guns.  These men don't seem very stable, although some of it may be related to the flashbacks they have to the atrocities in Iraq.  Their leave draws to a close, and King goes back to base for one final check-in, anticipating that he will soon be a civilian.  However, when he tries to check-out, he's informed by a random bureaucrat that he has to go back to Iraq - he's been stop-lossed.  King is outraged, punches out a few soldiers, and hightails it home.  The rest of the movie progresses from there.

""Stop-Loss"" starts off very strong and builds some nice characterizations, but really takes a chance by having the protagonist take on a less than heroic stance.  I suspect that some people cheered his actions; after all, the Iraq war is very unpopular and seen as unjust by many people.  However, it was never clear to me why King was so upset about his stop-loss.  Was he afraid of getting killed (he mentioned this a few times), was he suffering from PTSD and needed help (perhaps), or was he just mad that he wasn't informed earlier (seems so)?  With such murky intentions, the character comes off as unlikeable and petulant at times.  This problem made his journey far less impactful than it should have been, even when he meets with one of his former battalion members who was severely injured.  Also, as others here have mentioned, it just didn't seem realistic that he was told at such a late time that he was stop-lossed.  This detail and a few other issues again really impacted the movie for me.  Ryan Phillippe also gives a bland performance, which further dilutes the message and emotional impact.  His accent at times is so heavy it's hard to understand him and then it's nearly gone at other times.  What starts off as a powerful examination of war and its effects ends up a total mess - what a shame.",1228608000,11,2383,4.546948356807512
3342600,3,B0013FSL1Q,"How you feel about this movie will depend on how you feel about the invasion and occupation of Iraq in the first place.  I've been reading 1-star reviews by pro-military people, including active duty soldiers saying, ""These guys are cowards. If you volunteer, you're giving your life to the military, so do your duty.""  And 4-star reviews by people who are against the war, saying StopLoss captures the heartbreak and trauma this war has caused.

I know this movie isn't particularly accurate, but I still think it's  strong. From the point of view of most of the world, this is a movie about the bad guys. These soldiers are people who, because of cultural and economic pressure, joined the military thinking they were protecting their country. But the military (and the whole government) were controlled by war criminals.

They were sent into a battle that had nothing to do with 9/11. It was the product of leaders who wanted to conquer the world. They were betrayed into becoming the Imperial Storm Troopers from Star Wars. And when they try to get out, they are stop-lossed and sent back.

I know a lot of soldiers will strongly disagree (although I know some who agree just as strongly.) I know most soldiers try to do the right thing. But you can't do right when you're put into a situation where there is no right, in a country where you were never wanted.  I think Stop Loss captures their helplessness very well.

I only wish the movie makers had mentioned the possibility of refusing orders and doing your time, instead of running away or going back. Of soldiers who have refused to return, almost nobody has had to do more than a year. IMO, that's better than facing death or PTSD, or becoming a war criminal.

3342602,5,B0013FSL1Q,"How decent, brave, fairly naive kids get taken advantage of, is what this film invites us to think about. It is more a film about the psychological casualties of war stateside than about battle in Iraq. There is just enough battle to show why kids might have bad dreams and family problems when they get home, and so those scenes were necessarily condensed. This may be somewhat unrealistic, and certainly not representative for all soldiers, much as Jarhead may be not representative of everyone with regard to the boredom side of being in the military.

I do think absolutely that we should honor men and women who enlist with their eyes wide open. But many kids tend to have their eyes wide shut and the system too often takes advantage of this. This has been explored in many films. Gallipoli is one of my favorites. In Stop Loss as in the Australian film Gallipoli the kids were rather simple boys. Stop Loss deals with more or less beer-drinking small-town rural kids who are basically robust and any disillusionment does not come to the surface on the battlefield, although they are getting some kind of wake-up but they are tough and adaptable and it stays within.

The serious psychological conflicts erupt when they get back home for awhile. I think that the acting here of conflicted youth and the different individual ways of handling it (or not) is really great and the best feature of the film. Statistically sure not every soldier experiences post traumatic stress and/or family problems - but the point is that when it does happen, and it surely does! -- it can take many forms from subtle to quite overt.

It is easier to remember the dead than the damaged. I find it offensive that we honor the dead as heroes and too often treat the psychologically damaged as though they are not full human beings but rather ""weak,"" or ""cowards,"" or ""misfits."" In this particular war we even seem to try to keep the physically damaged soldiers out of the public mind, and bring the dead back quietly to keep the coffins away from the media.

Maybe this is the price of an all volunteer army, to keep the unpleasant stuff out of sight so that those kids who are naive will enlist with their eyes wide shut. Stop Loss offers kids an opportunity to think through some of the unpleasant things of which they may be unaware.

But even for an older person like me I think the film was a very well done fictional exploration of some of the home front realities of wars and of the War in Iraq in particular.",1224720000,2,2502,4.575892857142857

3342604,4,B0013FSL1Q,"""Stop-Loss,"" the second feature film directed by Kimberly Peirce, focuses on a group of army buddies.  We see them in a fire fight in Tikrit, Iraq that leaves several in their squad either dead or severely injured.

Their leader, Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe), is thrilled to complete his tour of duty and return to his Texas hometown.  There, he is greeted as a hero, decorated with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, and told by his senator to look him up in Washington if he needs anything.  Civilian life is looking good to Brandon when he is unexpectedly ordered back to Iraq, or stop-lossed.

Outraged at the army's failure to fulfill its part of his contract, Brandon decides to fight the order.  Instead of going back to base, he goes to Washington to seek the help of the senator.  But because he is AWOL, the senator will not see him.  He has become a fugitive, with both military and local police looking for him.

This is the first film about Iraq to really engage the viewer.  ""Rendition,"" ""Redacted,"" and ""Lions for Lambs"" were more preachy than entertaining, and never attracted large audiences.  ""Stop-Loss"" is a far more personal look at the human dimension of one policy, rather than an outright condemnation of the war. Brandon and his pals Steve (Channing Tatum), Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Rico (Victor Rasuk) are good soldiers. They do their duty, facing danger at every turn without complaint. In fact, Steve objects when he learns that Brandon is going against orders to fight a system he feels is unjust.  Brandon refers to the stop-loss policy as a back-door draft -- keeping soldiers after their contracts are up because recruitment is down and every one is needed to fight in either Iraq or Afghanistan.

At first, Peirce wanted to make a documentary about the stop-loss policy and interviewed some actual soldiers, but eventually settled on this fictional film using stop-loss as its key plot point.  She may have been too ambitious in telling Brandon's story and intercutting it with Tommy's self-destructive alcoholism and Steve's shaky relationship with his girlfriend, Michele (Amy Cornish).  Earlier films, such as ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home,"" have dealt with post-war trauma of returning soldiers, so the scenes involving Tommy and Steve are pretty predictable.  Phillippe is a fine actor who is just now getting larger roles in films.  He was excellent in both ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Breach,"" and now adds another exceptional performance with ""Stop-Loss.""  With a believable Texas twang, his Brandon registers as a regular guy who has become an excellent soldier.  He would no more think of disobeying an order than juggling scorpions.  He is respectful, honest, obedient, and courageous.  But he never comes across as a goody-goody.  He enjoys kicking back a few beers and raising hell on Saturday night with his pals.  So his Everyman is a guy we look up to.  When he decides to go AWOL, it is both dramatic and shocking.  Phillippe portrays Brandon not as a guy who wants to run.  His first instinct is to right an injustice, but the army, politics, and bureaucracy conspire against him.

The film has great strengths.  The opening sequence, beautifully staged and edited, shows Brandon in Iraq leading his men into what turns out to be an ambush.  We get a real feel for the fear that soldiers deployed in Iraq must undergo.  Trapped in a narrow alley, their vehicle and heavy machine gun destroyed, they have to battle gunfire from the roofs on both sides of the street, sheltering in strange buildings where death can wait at every turn.  These scenes rank with the most realistic movie battle scenes.

Another strong scene is Brandon's visit to Rico in a veteran's hospital.  Rico is severely disabled from the ambush in Iraq, yet retains his sense of humor and optimism.  As squad leader, Brandon feels responsibility for Rico's condition, yet is helpless to do more than pay him a visit and offer encouragement.  Rasuk, first seen on screen five years ago in ""Raising Victor Vargas,"" is a natural actor with great charm.  His small role and one memorable scene add resonance to the story, contrasting Rico's constructive attitude with Tommy's inability to get a grip on civilian life.

I was happy to see that Peirce avoided typical pitfalls.  A road trip Brandon takes with Michele, for example, remains just that, with no romantic complications.  The relationship between Brandon and his buddy's girlfriend is not typical Hollywood, and that's precisely why it rings true. ""Stop-Loss,"" rated R, is both the engaging story of one soldier trapped by an unfair, desperate practice, and a cautionary tale of how government policy can betray those who fight our wars.",1222300800,4,4733,4.935524652338811

The camera effects in the first act are a little distracting at times, and the road trip in the second act is stretched a bit longer than necessary, but well-deserved kudos to Kimberly Peirce for shining a light on an underreported aspect of the war and taking a nuanced shades of gray approach to her subject -- the Stop Loss policy itself is bad enough, there's no need to offer bad guy caricatures -- and going with the only ending that made sense.

Yes, there are politics about the war that the film addresses.  The film reflects that war is an awful experience.  Our fighting men and women are put into hellish circumstances that no father nor mother would wish on their children, but which world events prove necessary.  In a democracy such as ours, the people can change course or stay the course on Election Day.  I don't think you can fault the President for doing what he feels is appropriate or the soldiers who fight the war.  The ultimate responsibility is with the American people.  Ultimately this conflict is their choice IMHO.  However, ""Stop-Loss"" is not politics.  It deals in an artful manner with the consequences of war.  It does it honestly, even-handedly & with some excellent acting talent.  The DVD extra deleted scenes were interesting to watch.  The ending did not seem to fit the rest of the film, however.

3342631,3,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop Loss tried hard to get the emotional impact of fighting in Iraq right, and I think they succeeded in that. Where the movie falls down is when the soldiers get back to Texas, and are being phased out of the Army. That crucial part of the movie did not ring true, nor did the ending, which I won't give away. I can't believe the Army would be so cavalier as to have a low level clerk tell a decorated non-com they are being stop lossed. That news should have been delivered by the platoon leader. But I could be wrong - maybe the Army is that cold blooded. Other than that, this movie was solid although it could have done without the requisite bar scenes, and the movie lost continuity when it shifted twice during critical scenes back to the secondary stories of those who were not impacted by the stop loss. Too bad this movie didn't get wider play -it is an indictment of the Bush Administration trying to keep up our troop level committments without resorting to a draft.",1219449600,4,979,4.384615384615385
3342632,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Stop-Loss is defined by Wikipedia as ""the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date"" (please read the complete article).

""Stop-Loss"" is a movie, not so much about war, as it is about survival once our soldiers are home. How to cope with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? The film shows several examples. When astronauts are returned home, they are decompressed concerning their experiences. When prisoners of war are returned home, they, too, are decompressed, but soldiers from battle on leave? In this film, their commander advises them ""not to have sex with anyone underage or hit their wives or children.""

This is the story of Team Leader Brandon King (strongly played by Ryan Phillipe), a native of Brazos, Texas, who shortly after a failed firefight and unnecessary loss of men, returns home on leave, along with the other men in his company, to see several of his men become unglued.

When he tries to ""out-process"" himself and his military gear from active duty, he learns at the 24th hour that he has been Stop-Lossed, or his active duty time involuntarily extended for another tour of duty in Iraq. Why? Because men like him (with experience) are needed in a non-draft military. In contested cases the Army always wins because of contract loopholes in time of war. In other words, a ""back-draft"" is activated, placing experienced veterans ""back"" in a war environment.

The second half of the movie concerns King's reaction and actions toward what he finds as a grossly unfair Stop-Loss command. The path he takes or doesn't take is not so much the question as the question is: How fair is it for the government to assume control of a soldier about to be released from active duty, then use him for its own needs, and, as officials deem it, a necessity in time of war.

King sees a major option open to him: Go to Washington to see his local, supportive senator to find a way out of his situation. Other options: Leave the country as a deserter with new identity, knowing he can never go home again, or return to the service and Iraq and clear his name.

The paths King takes and choices he makes are heartbreaking and devastating. But I also found Stop-Loss morally reprehensible as military action that is both legal and binding without consideration for the individual soldier. In time of war the military has the presumptive right over the individual, but this is a war that President Bush legally declared ended.

In the final analysis, in a Stop-Loss action, the soldier must relinquish his individual rights, whether through desertion or in submission to duty. ""Stop-Loss"" becomes almost a documentary of Sgt. King's path through the quagmire of Stop-Loss.",1218931200,2,2803,4.876050420168068

3342636,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Hollywood has been having a hard time capturing the American post-9/11 experience, some films like ""Lions For Lambs"" are muddled political commentaries. Documentaries have done much better capturing the Iraq experience, especially ""Operation Homecoming"" and ""Taxi To The Dark Side."" Kimberly Peirce's ""Stop-Loss"" is one of the best dramatic efforts about Iraq yet produced, it has a lighter heart than the dark ""In The Valley Of Elah"" and makes a better effort at trying to understand the situation of soldiers returning from the front. It captures one particular phenomenon, I doubt Peirce meant this as a commentary on all Iraq war veterans in general, and no film could possibly capture the entire scope of the wartime experience in just an hour and forty-five minutes.

""Stop-Loss"" follows a group of small-town Texan soldiers returning from Iraq after brutal urban combat experiences. The film wonderfully captures the atmosphere and people of rural Texas with settings that feel completely authentic. The soldiers themselves are well-written, the screenply by Mark Richard and Kimberly Peirce create a gang of friends we grow to care about. They don't feel like cardboard recycles of previous films but like real young men experiencing traumatic events. Ryan Phillippe is especially convincing in his performance and loses himself in tone, accent and attitude. He's a long way from the kid we first met in films like ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""54.""

Peirce manages to create a film that mixes powerful drama with political commentary and visceral action. The scenes in Iraq are sharp and well-done, never evoking the morbid adrenaline of ""Rambo,"" instead she captures the confusion and raw reality of combat. Some will cringe or complain over the sight of Iraqi civilians being killed, but such is the reality of what is happening, those who disagree are welcome to put the film aside. The political angle of the film is well-handled, it is obvious this is an anti-war movie, but it also doesn't feel like a sermon. Peirce lets the characters, events and situations express the politics, it isn't like ""Lions For Lambs,"" which was literally just a discussion put on film. Here a character chooses to run, and the story follows his journey with intensity and emotion. Through simple, realistic moments of doubt, compassion and unity, Peirce expresses ideas about how our soldiers are being treated by the system, and without raising banners makes important questions about the nature of the war itself. This isn't a Michael Moore film, but it is an intelligent film that forces the audience to consider ideas and opinions as they are entertained by the main character's intense, uncertain quest.

There is some controversy generated over the film's main focus, the issue of ""stop-losses"" in the military where soldiers are forced to recycle service in Iraq or Afghanistan. Does it happen? According to official records it does. Does it happen exactly as in the movie? Maybe not, but keep in mind that films are forced to condense information for the sake of time and drama. Those who have questions should simply look-up any news or scholarship on the subject. Others are also angry at the depictions of soldiers coming back scarred from war, with serious emotional problems. Again, Peirce is not saying this is the ENTIRE experience for soldiers, her film is focusing on this particular, well-documented side of what soldiers returning from Iraq are going through.

""Stop-Loss"" is a moving, heartfelt picture, and yet the controversy expressed by some reviews should be expected. This is one of those special films that has important things to say in the age of commercialism, where issues like war and violence are reduced to cartoon junk food like ""Transformers"" or ""Rambo."" This is a film about people who have experienced a war and must deal with the aftermath. It is in the same league as previous statements in previous times like ""Johnny Got His Gun"" or ""Born On The Fourth Of July."" It does not dishonor the troops, on the contrary, it is speaking for those who's conscience is making them think. A previous reviewer mentions that we have a volunteer army, this is true, and because our men in uniform have chosen to defend our country they deserve better than being sent to fight a war without reason, for imperialism and oil. These are conclusions I drew, you may draw different ones.",1216339200,,4397,5.0523415977961434

I see MTV produced it and I think they wasted too much time trying to be hip with video collages and rap music at the beginning (and later at the end).  They also did not include enough ""bonding"" time to introduce the soldiers they were going to track with the audience so you would care more deeply about their predicament.  They should have patterned it after ""The Boys in Company C"" but ended up producing a story that stumbled along uncertainly from one character crisis to the next.  The scenes of the mangled soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital were moving but would have been more so if the character of the patient that served with the central character had been more developed.

Brandon believes that he is wrapping up his military career when he gets an unpleasant surprise:  he has been stop-lossed.  Unfortunately, due to the shortage of service members, the government has decreed that his contract with them be extended, thus making his eligible to be sent back to the Middle East for another tour.  Brandon is eager to fight this, even if it means going AWOL and risking a prison sentence to find a Washington official to help him.
  I think this film is extremely underrated and should have garnered more attention, especially for Cornish and Phillippe.

3342639,4,B0013FSL1Q,"The title of this film STOP-LOSS may puzzle many.  According to Wikipedia, 'Stop-loss, in the United States military, is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date. It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station (PCS) move for a member still in military service'.  According to writer (with Mark Richard)/director Kimberly Pierce (whose previous 'Boy's Don't Cry' tackled similarly volatile issues), the impetus for making this film about the effects of war on veterans returning home was her viewing of videos taken by soldiers while actively engaged in battle in Iraq: this is the first war where the soldiers have actually photographed their own experiences, documenting the realities/horrors of war on the now popular video equipment at their disposal.  It is a solid idea for a film, but somehow the idea gets diluted in the script.

Texas homeboys who have just returned from the Iraq war are greeted with a parade and medals and empty rhetoric, but find adapting to reentry into their native land is fraught with the deeply embedded mental wounds of their experience: interpersonal relationships fall apart, families face altered personalities in their sons, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome reigns.  Brandon (Ryan Phillippe) blames himself for the deaths of his men, Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drinks himself toward suicide, Rico (Victor Rasuk) attempts to see past his traumatically missing limbs, Isaac (Rob Brown) finds his entire world out of focus, and Steve (Channing Tatum) sees the military as his only point of reality to a life of success.  When Brandon receives his Stop-Loss instead of his discharge papers his world turns upside down and he flounders in his nightmares and his need for escape to Canada or Mexico with his friend Michelle (Abbie Cornish).  The horror of events that follow the homecoming of these damaged soldiers culminates in a tragedy that somehow results in the soldiers following the orders of the governmental Stop-Loss orders.  And that is the worst tragedy.

Though the message is important, the delivery of it gets hazy: the motivations of the characters are too loosely defined to convince us of their terrible plights.  But the impact on the public should be a wake-up call on the extended damage of war - any war- on the men and women who experience it first hand and carry the mental scars for life.  For that reason, if for no other, this is a film that should be seen.  Grady Harp, July 08",1215561600,7,2594,5.020979020979021
3342670,2,B0013FSL1Q,"I am not a professional critic of any sort by any means, but after watching the movie and reading some of these reviews, I will say that my review is as professional and ""accurate"" as it gets. I am a Soldier amongst thousands, who has experienced these parts, as 'acted' out in the film, in reality, and what you see and experience in the film are not so and are far fetch. From the most ridiculous setup of a hasty checkpoint to the suicidal pursuit of the insurgents upon their attack (into an easily predicted ambush in a random small alley, at that) in the opening scenes. The Soldiers are equipped with ISR's (internal squad radios), and yet they yell at each other in an insurgent infested building when one Soldier is wounded...Then you have the main character (SSG King) who gets ""individually"" stop-lossed on his very last day of clearing, only to report, with another unit, back to Iraq... In the midst of this, the movie portrays that just about every Soldier who has just returned home, to include SSG King, as having the worse PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) possible, leading to one fellow Soldier's suicide. Due to this PTSD, King, at one point in the movie, notices his car has been broken into and items have been stolen; at which point, he so very easily locates the perpetrators in a nearby alley (3 that I recall, armed with a handgun) and has a severe flashback of Iraq leading him to defeat these 3 thieves. Also, once King has been informed of this stop-loss, he reports directly to his LTC, superseding an unseen and unknown NCO support channel and Chain of Command. It's all bogus.

There were many things that were Very inaccurate in this movie and I think it is the wrong way to go about Honoring America's Military. Stop-loss is real. I have experienced it myself as I was in the middle of a PCS (permanent change of station), with my family to another Overseas assignment, only to be kept at my current station for 3 months leading into me deploying. It can be very inconveniencing, but not anything like it is portrayed in the film. I was not stop-lossed as an individual or as a small group for that matter. My entire Division was stop-lossed and stop-moved. I will also say that no Soldier, or Division or Unit even, will ever get stop-lossed directly after a Combat tour anywhere to be directed to report back to Combat effective immediately. That is not to say that a Soldier will not see another Combat tour during the Stop-loss cycle however. Combat sucks, especially for those who have endured it themselves, especially on more than one occasion, and even more so for the families who have suffered the Ultimate Sacrifice. Today's Army is an ALL volunteer force and Soldier's should be well aware of what their specific job within the Army entails them to do and the commitment they hold.

Soldiers do go through MANY hardships. More than any person who has not experienced the Army or Military life themselves, will EVER know. Soldiers do fight everyday in many locations and some do pay the Ultimate Sacrifice. Soldiers do get stop-lossed, but will not quit, give up, and then go AWOL when it happens. They will complain and get disgruntle over it, more than likely, but those same Soldiers will, as we say, ""suck it up and drive on."" Many Soldiers do have and will get PTSD, but will experience and deal with it in their own ways. Families will be happy when their loved ones return and indescribable when they don't... These things happen in reality, both good and bad and this movie is a piss poor example of how Soldiers live their lives and how the Army works. If you are going to make a movie to Honor Soldiers, their families and their sacrifices, don't make the movie about ONE Soldier who gets stop-lossed as an individual to report back to Iraq specifically, 2 weeks after returning home and then have that Soldier RUN away and go AWOL in rage. Films like ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" are films that Honor our Soldiers and give the civilian people a little taste of what a Soldier endures. Not this. I have yet to see any movie that accurately portrays the Soldiers today in Iraq and Afghanistan and the hardships they and their families endure, and honestly I don't wish to see a ""movie"" that does so. However, if a movie is going to be made, I would rather see that than what this movie did portray. Although many Soldiers have been through more than anyone can imagine, true Soldiers do not quit and run away from anything.

3342674,4,B0013FSL1Q,"STOP LOSS is a film with many virtues, especially its raw and rushed look by the great Chris Menges, but it hasn't much of a screenplay and some of the boys-only sequences leave audiences wondering how Kim Peirce thinks men spend their time together.  Ryan Phillipe has always found peace at the ranch, it's been a safe place, but now it's become a place of danger now that he is AWOL or whatever.  This ranch place is a couple of shacks hardly fit for dogs to live in, but the imaginary Texas boys of Peirce's screenplay slobber all over it like lt's the Grand Hilton of boy fun.  They shoot off dozens of rifles and handguns and kill them some wild animals.  I get it, it's sort of like Iraq, but it made me start thinking, maybe Iraq would be more fun for these boys if they could do the kind of uninhibited drinking they do out at their forty acre ranch.  Australian starlet Abbie Cornish seems to have prepared for her part as the girl next door by watching reel after reel of old LBJ press conferences, and her West Texas accent is startlingly good, if a little, well, brusque.  Any moment I expected her to pick up a beagle by its ears and swing it around.

You know what it's like, the hunting sequences in Vincente Minnelli's HOME FROM THE HILL.  I expect Minnelli had even less experience that Peirce being out on a weeklong fox hunt with a pack of drink-crazed good ol boys, but he brought an imagined, Bacchic frenzy to such sequences, amped up the red filter playing off the barbeque flames, and it paid off for him.  In each case, the director's fascination with masculinity makes film fairly pop with color and sweat.  Minnelli probably wished from his grave, that it had been he who had captured that shot of a drunken Channing Tatum, wearing only a pair of insanely tight, sultry and shiny Calvin Kleins, digging himself into a makeshift grave in his own front garden, cowering in the headlights of a car, crying and turning his own body into a Pieta.",1208995200,3,1968,4.456824512534819

On the day he is to be honorably discharged from the service, decorated army Sergeant Brandon King is ordered to return to duty in Iraq, the latest victim of ""stop-loss,"" a term for when soldiers who have fulfilled the terms of their military contract are denied permission to leave the service under penalty of court martial and imprisonment.  Brandon, caught emotionally off-guard by the news, impulsively decides to go AWOL, leaving his fellow troops to head back to the Middle East without him.  Brandon becomes a fugitive from justice, as much on the run from the memories that haunt him as from the authorities looking to bring him back.

A searing expose on the ""backdoor draft,"" ""Stop-Loss"" is an extraordinarily powerful drama that shows how men and women who have bravely served their country on the field of battle (along with the loved ones they have left behind) are being betrayed by the very government they fought to defend.  Yet, ""Stop-Loss"" is no star-turn polemic like ""Lions for Lambs,"" but, rather, an intensely personal drama that illuminates its issue in starkly human terms.  The grim realities of post-war trauma - both physical and psychological - are vividly dramatized in the persons of Brandon and his buddies, all of whom have returned to their small Texas town radically changed men.  But the film is also about that special sense of camaraderie and group cohesion that develops among soldiers who have fought side by side under hellish circumstances - and the lifelong bond that results.

Despite the wide-ranging nature of the theme, writer/director Kimberley (""Boys Don't Cry"") Peirce and co-writer Mark Richard keep the drama modest in scope and intimate in scale.  It's true that there are times when the screenplay threatens to fall victim to its own contrivance, but the quality of performance and authenticity of detail always bring the movie back into line.

Long a fine but under-appreciated actor, Ryan Philippe truly comes into his own in this film, delivering a performance of such raw truth and emotional complexity that we literally cannot take our eyes off him for the duration of the movie.  Ditto for Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Victor Rasuk, all equally superb as men who served alongside Brandon in Iraq and who now have their own personal, war-related demons to wage battle against.  Abbie Cornish is also excellent as the friend who accompanies Brandon on his panic-stricken flight across the country.

There are those who will object to ""Stop-Loss"" on strictly political grounds, seeing it as yet another anti-war diatribe designed to make the Bush administration look bad.  Yet, the film transcends politics, honoring the bravery and valor of the soldiers while reserving the right to question the wisdom and morality of those in power who would send these fine young men on such a fool's errand in the first place - and then insist on doing it over and over again.  I frankly can't imagine anything more pro-American or pro-troop than that.",1207958400,4,3018,5.032128514056225
3342676,4,B0013FSL1Q,"""Stop-loss"" is a term coined by the government for a particularly cruel practice, namely the arbitrary rescinding of a soldier's exit from the war theater. Supposedly only employable in times of war, it has been used during the Iraq-Afghani conflict to maintain strong numbers of troops in high-risk areas. The soldier, apparently, has no warning of the fact that he is stop-lossed until processing his papers to get out and go home. This, at least, is what happens to the protagonist in this movie.

The film does not dwell on the battles in Iraq, although it begins there, introducing us to a bunch of good-old-boy young men from the same small town in Texas, who have been together for a long time in Iraq and are used to thinking as a unit and looking out for each other. It shows them during the excruciating boredom of down-time, and then leads us through a terrible encounter in the crowded, narrow streets of a town in Iraq, skirmishing with snipers and terrorists, and leaves nothing to the imagination about the cruelties of war.

Shortly thereafter, it shows the boys coming home, for what they think is for good. Ryan Phillippe, in a strong performance as the sergeant of the unit, is broadsided by the news that he is being almost immediately shipped back to Iraq, and he understandably protests vehemently. His superior, considering him a flight risk by his demeanour, orders him escorted to the stockade, and in a chance moment of opportunity while being marched to transport, he disables his guards and escapes.

His plan after his escape is to take the unfairness and seeming illegality of his enforced reenlistment straight to some politician who can effect change, but one feels from the start that it is a bit like the mouse that roared; government is government, and is impervious to chiding from a nonentity like an inconvenienced soldier. His efforts are altruistic; he is not trying to bring justice just for himself, but for all the soldiers who come home expecting to get married, take a job as a car salesman, and try to forget the horrors of war. It's plain, however, that he is up against an immovable force.

There have been some strong, well-acted, and well-presented films of late on the Iraq conflict and/or its effect on the young people who go there believing, no doubt, that they can make a difference. Certainly some difference is made, but the toll it takes on the psyches of those in conflict is dire and sad. I grew up during the Viet Nam War, and do not profess to know the extent of damage that conflict made on those involved - heavy, I know - but war is war, and no one involved emerges unscathed, I am sure. It is made clear in Stop-Loss that idealism is quickly stripped away, and despair becomes endemic.

Strongly acted by all participants, and Ryan Phillippe in particular deserves kudos.",1207785600,5,2837,4.723232323232323
3342677,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Kimberly Pierce's last movie was ""Boys Don't Cry,"" starring Hilary Swank who gave a critically acclaimed performance. Now eight years later Pierce directs ""Stop-Loss, the term used to describe the military's sending soldiers back to battle when they have just finished one combat tour of duty. I am not sure what I was expecting but I got more than I bargained for as apparently did the other members of the audience from both my and their reactions. They ranged from audible sobs that began almost immediately after the film began, to groans to one man's comment sitting near me of ""damn this country."" Although I have never seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" but know of the first 20 minutes or so of the violent depiction of battle in that film, I cannot fathom, however, that it is rawer and bloodier than the first few minutes of ""Stop-Loss."" The violence and bloodshed are relentless, and the battle scenes are shot as if they were done by an amateur with a hand-held video camera.

The acting is impeccable; the cinematography --by Chris Menges-- is extraordinary. The film essentially belongs to Ryan Phillipe who plays Sgt. Brandon King-- although there are no bad performances--, recently having returned to his hometown in Texas after completing a tour of duty in Iraq where he lost several of his men. On the day that he is to have been discharged, he learns that he has been reassigned to Iraq. Rather than return to combat, he goes AWOL and does a cross-country drive to Washington with his friend Michelle played by Abbie Cornish in another first-class performance. They in their naivete initially believe that their senator will be able to help them.

I am not sure what the director wanted to achieve. Supposedly she made the movie out of anger over her brother's experience as a soldier in Iraq. If she wanted to show the horror of war, she more than accomplished her mission. The violence and the heartwrenching fate of the soldiers, both in and after combat, begin in the first frames of the film and never abate. The nadir of this movie-- although several events come close-- occurs when King, on his way to D. C., visits his forever-maimed buddy in a hospital. The soldier's optimism-- is he whistling in the dark-- in such overwhelming adversity-- will tear your heart out.

Upon leaving the theatre, I wondered if this film would have any effect on anyone. The hawks and doves probably will not change their positions on the Iraq War. On the other hand, conventional wisdom says that sometimes art does make a difference. The novel UNCLE TOM'S CABIN we are told influenced how people felt about slavery. And recently much was made by the media as to whether ""Saturday Night Live's depiction of Hillary Clinton's unfair treatment by the media with a capital ""M"" would in any way have an impact on voters.

If nothing else, this film stands for the proposition that indeed boys-- even grown men-- do cry, as evidenced both by the men in ""Stop-Loss"" and the men in the audience.",1206921600,11,2991,4.757225433526012
3342678,5,B0013FSL1Q,"Director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Don't Cry"") brings another powerfully charged film of such raw emotion that upon later reflection of the movie I felt like I had witnessed real events.

Stop-Loss follows the fictional story of a soldier, Brandon King (Ryan Philippe), who has returned home after a tour in Iraq. His contract is up and he just about to get out when he is stop-lossed (a ""fine-print"" section in all soldiers' contracts that gives the President the power to extended soldier's contracts in time of war). He refuses to be shipped back to Iraq, and goes AWOL in search of his state's senator for help. What follows is his road trip to fight the stop-loss as well as showing the devastating affects his fellow soldiers (Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) experience from the horrible war. Its' acting, directing, and writing had such a feeling of authenticity, and combined with the fact that 81,000 of our brave soldiers have already been stop-lossed since Spetember 11,2001, this film feels like a true story.

One thing that made this film succeed so well was it's director was a woman, and she was able to make a movie were you could feel and see the emotions these guys were feeling even as they would desperately try and mask them.

The acting was extraordinary from the three main soldiers, most notably Ryan Philippe who is so gritty and real in his performance that he seems like he actually is a marine. Channing Tatum gives a genuine performance, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt's is the most haunting of the trio as a soldier who fights his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with excessive amounts of booze and slowly slips into a deep hole of despair.

This films is not a propaganda piece, it simply portrays something that is going on right now. It brings up many good points, but never bashes you with a certain viewpoint but leaves it to you to decide. This is such emotionally powerful, deeply moving film, the best film I have seen since the year started, and destined to be one of my favorites from this year.",1206835200,5,2032,4.747875354107649
3342679,4,B0013FSL1Q,"Kimberly Peirce made ""Stop-Loss"" in reaction to her brother's experiences as an Iraq soldier, and her anger on behalf of Iraq soldiers burns through the celluloid. Unfortunately, that anger also makes the movie somewhat misshapen. By concentrating so much on the plight of one soldier (Ryan Philippe) who has been ""stop-lossed""--ordered back to Iraq without his prior knowledge and against his will--Peirce shortchanges most of the other characters in the movie. The sorrowful ending feels rushed after what has come before, and I wish she had made Philippe's commanding officer (Timothy Olyphant) less of a one-note martinet villain. Nevertheless, the film serves as a powerful brief on behalf of fighting men (and women too, though the film portrays no women soldiers) whom the military sees less as human beings than as war materiel to be deployed at its whim. Peirce makes the point emphatically that these are not wimpy draft-dodgers (there being, of course, no draft to dodge), but courageous, battle-hardened soldiers who love their country and are placed in an unendurable dilemma by the practice of stop-loss.

Many sequences of the film crackle with power and suspense, thanks partly to the superb camera work of cinematographer Chris Menges. (The early, flickering home-movie sequences of combat in Iraq are a sad, sardonic parody of current armed-forces recruiting commercials.) But what really makes ""Stop-Loss"" worth seeing is the power of the performances. Ryan Philippe--who showed greater-than-average promise in such films as ""Gosford Park"" and ""Breach""--gives his finest performance to date as the stop-lossed soldier, a man torn apart by conflicting imperatives. Channing Tatum, as his best Army buddy, and Abbie Cornish as Tatum's fiancee are equally fine. The always brilliant Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a strong impression as an alcoholic screwup who can't envision a life beyond the Army, and so does Victor Rasuk as a hideously maimed member of Philippe's squad. It's too bad that other fine actors--such as Olyphant, Ciaran Hinds as Philippe's father, Mamie Gummer as Gordon-Levitt's fiancee and Josef Sommer as a pompous senator--are consigned to glorified walk-ons. Nevertheless, Peirce has put on screen a memorable advocacy piece on behalf of the American fighting man. This film, almost by definition, will be a tough sell to audiences; I hope it finds its niche.",1206835200,4,2394,5.384

They should not have chosen the actors they did to play those characters because they did a DAMN Good job at making me realize that this was NOT just another made up War Movie with a fictitious story line.  There is no way it could have been. There was just too much Reality and Facts built into the story and the acting... Superb.  At the end of this Movie there is nothing that lead me to ever believe this was a FICTICIOUS STORY.  This movie made me afraid to be alive in this world today, afraid to know that our Countries Sons, Grandsons, Brothers, Husbands, Nephews, Friends and Daughters are being subjected to this type of life for way too long! Subjected to act as a killing machine and be involved in so much violence and killing for years, and then enduring a heart wrenching decision between your sanity, family, and your life all due to a technically illegal Stop Loss!? It would drive anyone insane. I realize how RIGHT I am to believe that this really did, has and continues to happen everyday. Sad but very well made.",1501372800,,1124,4.415458937198068
