4327167,5,B004CGUBZW,"Seemingly inspired by Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"", this film is masterfully written, directed, photographed, and acted.

The audience is a witness to a very simple gathering of a family to commemorate a brother and son's untimely death.
It is minimalistic in its direction and yet acutely aware of its details. Dialogue flows effortlessly as if it were never scripted. The characters' emotions are held behind Japanese culture of modesty and humility. The characters are petty, silly, begrudging, and sad. They struggle with emotions that are universal to all families.

The pacing is perfect but some may find it slow. This isn't a hollywood movie. There are no fights, no blood, no gore, no profanity and no sex. Audiences are free to interpret their emotional reactions and never feel like your being manipulated. We don't see a build of emotion and a final cathartic explosion that leads to a happy ending. It's much more realistic than our usual main-stream family drama fare. Some scenes can make one viewer sad while another might smile wistfully.

It is beautiful in its honesty and poignant while remaining unpretentious.

The best way I can describe the emotions this film evoked was the bunched-up-throat feeling you get when you hold back your tears.  It's like crying through a smile.

The film is utterly entrancing in it's simple complexity of human emotion, relationships and memories.  The beautiful cinematography, the human characters and the soft and simple musical score wove a spell around me and didn't let go.

""Still Walking"" is a mesmerizing visual poem.",1300147200,7,1581,5.124513618677042
4327168,4,B004CGUBZW,"I really enjoyed this movie for what is was; a slice of ordinary life. This is a film whose story is told in the quiet moments of life, a film in which you must read in between the lines to fully understand. If you aren't in a contemplative mood it may be a little slow at times, but upon reflection the pace of the movie mirrors the type of family life being depicted perfectly.

I will admit, for much of the film I found myself enjoying it...yet in the back of my mind, wishing for some sort of major conflict or plot point to spice things up. That being said, I don't think that would have been appropriate and would have cheapened the deeper story being softly told in the film. The theme which is related mostly to family, loss, and ageing is best told in the gracefully slow and meditative manner in which this film presents it. Again, I must make a point to recommend watching this movie when you are in a contemplative mood, as you will get much more out of it in that state.

This is a perfect example of film as anti-escapism. Certain people watch movies to get their minds off of life...Hollywood blockbusters which focus more on special effects than character development are a perfect example of this. The idea is to 'shut off your mind and have a good time'...and there's nothing wrong with that. However, I find a film which speaks to the deeper issues in life infinitely more valuable. Still Walking is such a movie...it grows better and better upon reflection.

It is the best depiction of family dynamics I have seen in cinema because it does not require extraordinary circumstances to highlight the flaws and strengths of the individual relationships that exist within the clan.  The end, while unassuming, was among the most moving I have ever encountered in film.

4327174,5,B004CGUBZW,"At base, this film is about a family dealing with tragedy.

But it doesn't floor you with melodrama. This film is so subtly powerful that a single line, spoken with an undertone of grief, can bring tears to your eyes. This film asks you to read between the lines - to find love, and pain, in minute details. The drama is understated, but present everywhere.

4327177,2,B004CGUBZW,"This is an indoor family drama about a Japanese family who still have yet to come to terms over the untimely death of a promising son, years before.  The father is a retired doctor who hoped to bequeath his practice to his eldest son, but the latter died saving a complete loser from drowning.  The remaining son hasn't risen to the occasion.

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this movie was adapted from a play:  the action is all verbal, all internal.  Why was this even a movie?  It was serviceable material for a book, to be sure, but the element of film was poor soil for this material:  one frequently finds oneself nodding off.

It's a very Henry James sort of approach:  all the ""action"" is internal, psychological.  So far, so good.  But the film fails for the same reason that films based on James's books usually fail:  unless your action is visual, it's probably not a good idea to make a film of it.  You're going to bore people.",1347580800,,947,4.436046511627907

4327179,5,B004CGUBZW,"There are some films that say a whole lot while remaining, for the most part, silent.  `Still Walking' is one of those films, for it remains quiet throughout, exploring subtlety as a key plot devise in order to hit us where it counts in moments we don't see coming.  In fact, about halfway through I was becoming almost inpatient in my wonderment as to where exactly this film was going, but when it gets there it GETS THERE.  I think that is much of the beauty in `Still Walking'.  It doesn't come out and say anything and yet when the film concludes you are left with so much to ponder that the eventual conclusions drawn are deeper and more fulfilling than if the film had made it a point to beat us over the head with `their' observations.

`Still Walking' takes place over a single weekend where a family gets together to mourn the anniversary of the death of the Yokoyama's eldest son.  The parents are obviously consumed with the deepest grief, twelve years after the accident, and their remaining children (they have a surviving son and daughter) are left to pick up the pieces.  Their daughter seems ready to move right in with her family and take over, in a seemingly selfish and possibly self-gratifying way, but their son, Ryota, seems almost repulsed by his parents.  Having married a widow (who has a young son), his marriage isn't necessarily accepted by his parents and he feels distanced from them and their constant cleaving to memories better left alone.  Over the course of lunch and dinner and conversations, the Yokoyama family secrets are revealed with such touching detail that one is completely consumed with the storytelling and the development.

And MY GOD does Kirin Kiki deliver one of the finest performances I've seen in a long time.  The way she handles her two big scenes (her confession of her pain and the butterfly scene) are so heartbreaking and sincere.  It's a powerhouse performance that underscores each emotion with that needed touch of authenticity.  The rest of the cast, especially Yoshio Harada, are also on the top of their games here.

With vivid writing that reaches the soul and acute attention to detail, `Still Walking' is still moving, time after time after time.",1344384000,3,2216,4.767015706806283
4327180,3,B004CGUBZW,"This 2008 film is not for everyone, especially for people who do not appreciate family films, family values, family dissension.  It can be slow, so be prepared.  But generally, I appreciate a film that gives the view more to feel by watching the characters, experiencing emotions, etc.

Family dynamics is the theme, where the adult family members come to the home of the aging parents for a reunion, and dinner to commemorate the life of the eldest son who died 15 years ago.  There is tension with the father, an ex-physician, and the remaining son who feels he never measured up to his brother, and feels not fully accepted by his father.  The pace is very slow and don't expect any drama. It takes quite some time to get to the meat of the story.

The film is written and directed by Hirokazu Kore-Eda, and my familiarity exists with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nobody-Knows/dp/B000A5044C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nobody Knows</a>, which I thought was a very good film with children abandoned by their mother, and fending for themselves in an apartment.  .....Rizzo",1340409600,,1118,5.354285714285714
4327181,5,B004CGUBZW,"The acting is fantastic in that it is all natural- there is no scenery chewing, and Kore-eda's well-paced and naturalistic script, the understated but deftly placed musical score by Gontiti, and the unobtrusive, yet evocative cinematography Yutaka Yamasaki, all work synergistically, but in the curious way of adding up to less than the sum of their parts....which is somehow perfect, because less equals more, at least in terms of naturalism. There's not a forced moment in the film, and it is not a tearjerker, even though it left my wife weeping, and me profoundly moved. This is because it is a deeply and genuinely affecting film. The closest film, in tone, that I can think of, in terms of American cinema, is Woody Allen's 1988 masterpiece, starring Gena Rowlands: Another Woman, wherein drama, on a grand scale, is achieved by focusing on people who do not live on such a scale. Still Walking is an example of cinemature in both senses of the term: mature filmmaking and literature-like in its depth and profundity.

  As for Still Walking? The old saw about them not making films like that any longer is true, at least for Hollywood. But they do make great, mature films still....elsewhere. Go East, young man! Go East!",1340236800,,1228,4.866028708133971
4327182,5,B004CGUBZW,"Much like Lawrence Kasdan's The Big Chill, Still Walking is hard to describe in a single logline.  While it is a family drama that unfolds mostly during the anniversary of the death of the family's eldest son, that's a little like saying that the Big Chill takes place at a funeral.  It's really about the extended family dynamic, all the subtle ways in which the family unit is changing, and also the ways in which the family's values are being retained.  It's a complex film, but it is a joy to watch.

I really felt like I was a fly on the wall of Grandma's house.  Writer-director Hirokazu Kareeda keeps the camera mostly static, allowing his actors to play out most scenes in long and medium shots, coming in for the close ups only when absolutely necessary.  He exhibits a deft touch that doesn't so much point us to his conclusions about the characters, but instead allows us to slowly accumulate impressions until we form our own conclusions.  Proof of his mastery is the fact that, in the end, I think my conclusions were exactly the ones he wanted me to have.

Every performance here is pitch perfect.  I have to wonder how close these actors were to the characters they were portraying.  There's very little ""acting"" seen onscreen here.  I hesitate to single any one member of the cast out as they all deserve accolades as an efficient and convincing ensemble.

Settings are realistic and efficient but they're also thrilling to see as an outsider of Japanese culture.  I felt like I was getting a real look into the lives of regular Japanese people -- something rarely seen in Japanese cinema outside that country.  As such, I also got the feeling that our differences really amount to the trappings and not so much to the people.  If there is an ultimate message here, I think it's that people will be people, regardless of their generations, countries, jobs, or economic statuses.

If there is any fault to be given the picture, it's that it's a little bit difficult to get into at first.  Kareeda doesn't feel the need to give us all the information about everyone up front, so at first it can feel a little like eavesdropping on a family argument at the next table over.  But I was amazed by how I felt like I knew these people intimately by the time the movie was over.  I think that's due to the fact that we're given tiny bits and pieces along the way in much the same way we get to know our real world friends and family.  As soon as it was over, I felt compelled to go back and watch the movie again.  I was amazed by just how much more I liked the beginning of the film on the second viewing after I'd really ""met"" the characters.",1335225600,,2652,4.460580912863071
4327183,5,B004CGUBZW,"This Criterion Collection movie, from the time I opened the package, I knew would be a unique experience when I was treated to a booklet giving inside information on the director and others involved in creating this jewel.  The movie begins with the sounds of the chopping of vegetables for a dish the mother is preparing.  This intrigued me right from the ""git-go.""  I was mesmerized by every aspect of this movie, from the visual feast aspect of it, to the sensitive portrayal of all the members of this disfunctional, but somehow normal, family. As an added bonus, the recipes for the different dishes are included in the booklet.  After watching them being prepared I found myself excited to know I would be able to duplicate them.  This movie lingers in one's mind long after viewing.  I would recommend it in a heartbeat.",1332374400,3,827,4.748251748251748
4327184,5,B004CGUBZW,"""Still Walking"", after multiple viewings, is right up there among my all-time favorite movies. Characters so real there wasn't a single false note in the entire film. Most of the time, I actually forgot I was watching a movie, so natural was the development and so unforced the scenes. Paced to perfection, the film gave you time to get to know everyone on the screen, and left you sad at the end that you had to say goodbye to them.

The most amazing thing about Koreeda's achievement is that this film accomplishes everything with NO PLOT! It's like he took Jerry Seinfeld's advice seriously and made a movie in which ""Nothing Happens!"" And you really don't want for anything to happen. It's enough to be a fly on the wall during this most remarkable family reunion, dealing most tenderly with every emotion in the book: anxiety, resentment, melancholia, regret, frustration, grief, hatred, confusion... but mostly, love.

This is a film about family, and how they make us what we are.

If you don't walk away from this movie more appreciative of your own family, whatever its faults and dysfunctions, you haven't been watching.",1329091200,,1130,4.844559585492228
4327185,4,B004CGUBZW,"This film reminded my quite a bit of the films of Yasujiro Ozu.  Recipe?  Take a typical seeming Japanese family, introduce a little oddity (in this film the son marrying the widow is the little oddity - at least to his parents), and have a recent or upcoming death in the family.  Don't dwell on too much dialogue and shoot beautiful settings, mostly indoors.  This is the trademarked Ozu recipe for success.  And Kore-Eda does an admirable job.

Also of note: there are some terrific special features and a wonderful book included in the Criterion release.  The interview with Kore-Eda is eye opening and you can really gain a sense of understanding about his personality and this film in general, which is slightly autobiographical.

There is nothing to really 'spoil' about this film.  It is stately paced and takes place over the two days that the elderly parents have their two children and their spouses and the grandchildren over.  They are reminiscing about the death of the eldest son (a kind of tradition in Japan - to celebrate the life of and remember the death of loved ones on the anniversary of their death).  Though we never really hear what had happened to the son, we know that the parents blame one of his friends.  Through this and other little flashes, we find out that the elderly parents are actually quite hateful and vindictive in small doses.  They constantly bicker with one another and continue to question their younger son's marriage to the widow.

In his interview, Kore-Eda said that the mother 'spews venom', and it's true, though in small flashes.  It's interesting, and she has the most complex character.  The other actors are all very good, though the daughter has a rather annoying voice at times.

In contrast to Ozu's films however, this film never really touches on the strong bond one family member has for another.  The only real bond we see is the son and the widow and her son (Ryo and his immediate family).  It is strange because this is the relationship continually questioned by the other family members.  But Ozu consistently shows the elderly parents as loving and peaceful in their old age, often despite being stubborn or even mean when they were younger parents.  The viewer is then sad at the elderly persons' lives and emptiness.  But in this film we never really sympathize with them.

There is also the lack of a strong, young female role.  The actress who plays the widow is very good, but she is no Setsuka Hara.  And the grandfather is to Chishu Ryu.  Nonetheless it is a very good modern Japanese film built in the tradition of classic, quiet, and poignant films.  Well worth viewing if you are an Ozu fan, or if you don't mind enjoying films that are quiet, stately, and don't really have true resolution.  It's a slice of life drama, and one that is wonderfully crafted and worthy of a Criterion release.  The only reason I gave four stars is that it just doesn't really resound like many complex family dramas from Japan in the past and present.

4327186,4,B004CGUBZW,"The story and plot is nothing new. But it still stands apart, because of the subdued yet intimate and elegant approach.
No melodrama or climax. Instead the film watches the entire family for some 24 hours and scrutinizes the relationships between all the character and undercurrents within the relationships through innumerable snippets. Resembles a 'Rondo' musical structure.

The story is told in a serene pace - mostly within the rooms of the house, only to be intercepted by some walking or driving shots in the Yokohama area. But we do not feel bore as it draws the viewer close to the family; it echos many of the feelings that we possess as well. As if we also become a visitor to the house for the day.

Invariably it reminds Ozu - the subtle treatment, silent (and some static) shots of neighborhood, simple artifacts of house (plants, painting) and a very intimate study of human mind. May not be as high as 'Tokyo Story', but it made itself worth watching even after Ozu's monumental work.",1316822400,,1000,4.741379310344827

If you haven't watched that old film, it is a family drama, in which grown-up children come back to visit their parents. ""Still Walking"" has exactly the same theme. It is an absolutely brilliant film if you are interested in this kind of film. I liked the film because it deals with expressed emotions, interpreted emotions, and true emotions. First thing to note is that it is very difficult to read the true emotions based on the expressed emotions. Second thing to note is that the Japanese have trouble interpreting the emotions of the other people as well. So it is not just a Westerner which have trouble with this. Even though, naturally, it doesn't get any easier if you don't know the culture. I'm not going to say more about the film. Just buy it and watch it.",1306972800,6,1001,5.549019607843137

If only he could consciously act of that insight. This wonderful film has been throughly reviewed here by half a dozen others - all to excellent results. Still Walking is the only film I have seen by this director Hirokazu Kore-eda. From my research he has made 6 - 7 films all critically acclaimed with a heavy influence by Yasujiro Ozu. Which was apparent but only in small doses.

 After watching this film I'd say he has more in common with Edward Yang and the film Yi Yi as a modern day dysfunctional family going through what they believe to be the right motions only to arrive back at that moment where they started. Failing  to recognize the moment as the same one - the continuous circle of life and how little control we actually have making every action a potential for something wonderful however minute.

8423005,5,B004CGUBZW,"Kore-eda Hirokazu is probably Japan's best currently-active film director. Lionized at Cannes and other festivals, he has attained a level of international recognition other Japanese directors can only dream of. There are many similarities between him and his idol, the great Ozu Yasujir, though obviously there are differences as well. Parallels have also been drawn with the quiet meditative world of Taiwanese masters Hou Hsiao Hsien, Tsai Ming-liang and Edward Yang. Kore-eda's background is in documentaries and the subject matter of his fictional films is often taken from real life usually featuring in-vogue media issues. His debut feature Maboroshi (1995) centered on a topical female neurotic disorder and he went on to make a film about a true case of encephalopathy titled Without Memory (1996). The subject of religious cults in the wake of the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack was treated in Distance (2001) and a real-life case of child abandonment was chillingly depicted in Nobody Knows (2004). He made an unsuccessful excursion into Jidai-geki with Hana (2006) and an uncharacteristic fantasy about a man whose sex doll comes to life called Air Doll (2009). But he also made a profoundly moving metaphysical meditation on the meaning of existence in Afterlife (1998) which in my book is a masterpiece. Centrally though, Kore-eda has concentrated in his work on the disintegration of modern family life in a series of shmin-geki (family home dramas). I Wish (2011) depicts two brothers searching for each other; Like Father, Like Son (2013) echoes a real life newspaper headline in which babies are swapped at birth by a malicious maternity nurse with domestic disruption ensuing for both sets of parents; and Our Little Sister (2015) follows the fortune of a group of sisters adapting to a male-free environment.

Still Walking (Aruitemo, Aruitemo, 2008) is for me Kore-edas greatest film to date and like the other shmin-geki he has made it is Ozuian through and through. Based on his own family experience, it examines a family during a get together in a situation very similar to the one depicted in Ozus postwar masterpiece Early Summer (Bakushu, 1951) where the first born son has died and the various family members are commemorating his loss. As with the Ozu film three generations of a family are depicted with an equal weighting which takes on board the feelings and emotions of several characters simultaneously. The elders of the Yokoyama clan are proud retired doctor Kyohei (Harada Yoshio) and his long-suffering wife Toshiko (Kiki Kirin). Under him is his second son Ryota (Abe Hiroshi, a famous TV comedian in Japan here essaying and triumphing in his first serious role), his new recently widowed wife Yukari (Natsukawa Yui) and her son Atsushi (Tanaka Shohei) from her first marriage. Then there are the Kataokas  Ryotas sister Chinami (You), her husband Nobuo (Takahashi Kazuya) and their children. Each character is fleshed out by Kore-eda delicately with Ozuian nuance over the period of roughly 24 hours. Those familiar with Ozu will know Ozuian means quiet, simple and natural with a complete absence of false melodrama or out-sized soap opera theatrics. The film is full of very real tangible emotion and deals with universal tensions and unresolved differences which run underneath family life. To Western eyes much of the conversation here may seem nave and flat, but believe me, living in Japan as I do I can verify the dialogs are very true to everyday discourse within a family here. The setting and treatment may appear to be very Japanese and inaccessible to those outside, but with patience youll realize the tensions and emotions essayed here are recognizable to all of us regardless of where we live.

The old doctors first son drowned while saving the life of a man and when this man visits the Yokoyamas to pay his respect on the anniversary of his saviors death he is revealed as an overweight, sweaty, bumbling nobody. All family members castigate him after he leaves and the feeling is why did the son (who was a bright medical student on his way to taking over his father Kyoheis practice) have to sacrifice his life for such a nerdy non-achiever? Kyohei registers his grief with his barely concealed contempt for his other offspring, his airhead daughter who doesnt know how to cook and especially the younger son Ryota who in his eyes can never replace what he has lost. Ryota is also struggling to achieve anything in the world, a middle aged Tokyo sarariman (salaryman) who still feels (and is treated) like a child. Frustration comes to a head especially when he returns home and all his sensitive buttons are pressed. His father barely acknowledges his stepson let alone his daughter-in-law. Meanwhile Kyoheis wife Toshiko suffers on in silence, but still cant resist (in the films most piercingly effective moment) singing the song Aruitemo Aruitemo which gives the film its Japanese title. This is the very song her husband played on the gramophone while committing adultery in the next room with an old flame years before. Hearing his wife sing this song whilst lying in his bath, the recollection stabs him like a knife in a moment of extraordinarily moving insight. On the surface everything bubbles along happily, but as we all know polite conversation only masks yawning chasms which separate members of any given family. This film masterfully pinpoints the true source of contemporary heartache in which helter-skelter modern life overwhelms traditional home securities which perhaps were never that secure to begin with.

Beyond the subject matter there is the marvelous way this film is shot. Kore-eda's camera in his non-shmin-geki films is usually restless, handheld in the best traditions of documentaries. Here the camera is largely static, very low so that we get that unique Ozuian perspective of the tatami interiors, with a large number of 90 degree reverse cuts. Shots tend to be long with the actors allowed to express their emotions with tender restraint. This contrasts markedly with the current trend in contemporary cinema towards machine gun cutting which doesnt leave actors a chance to make an impression at all. The film may feel reactionary or even old fashioned to some, but such a restrained quiet approach works devastatingly and is for me surely much more exciting than the wham-blam-glam that assaults us noisily down at the local multiplex. Perhaps I have been in Japan too long, but for me the film is a masterpiece of understated emotions and the shifting sands of everyday life which are always on the move. The transience of all things was possibly Ozu's greatest theme, as most obviously visualised with his passion for trains. Still Walking also features train rides which bookend the films narrative. This very consciously echoes the frame of Tokyo Story (1953) and the appearance of trains in virtually every Ozu feature, especially perhaps Late Spring (1949) and this films greatest influence, Early Summer (1951). In an intensely moving scene of that film the old family patriarch sits and waits for a train to pass at a crossroads. The train symbolizes lifes permanent transience. Lifes only certainly is the certainty of change. This change is registered at the end of Still Walking as Ryota returns to his fathers place with a new baby and driving a car rather than riding a train. Things have to change in order that they can remain the same.",1473120000,4,7456,5.049512987012987
8423006,5,B004CGUBZW,"This is one of my all-time favorite Japanese drama films - the only one I like better is ""Tokyo Sonata"".  I have watched this at least 4 or 5 times now, and I never tire of it - it is a wonderful ""slice-of-life"" film, and Hiroshi Abe is wonderful in it - the entire cast is amazing.  You feel as though you are a part of this family, complete with all of their quirks and misunderstandings.  Fantastic movie!!",1468454400,3,409,4.217948717948718

8423008,5,B004CGUBZW,"This movie is a real gem. A simple story about a day in the life of a family commemorating the death of a son. Nothing extravagant or loud happens but you come away deeply affected. Koreeda is a master of small gestures and invisible moments, marginalia that gets swept away in the rush of life. Koreeda polishes these moments and makes them shine. Lyrical and poignant, the movie lingers in the mind long after it's done.",1448928000,,422,4.565789473684211
