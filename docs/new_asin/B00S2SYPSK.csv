6951022,5,B00S2SYPSK,"Written by Kristoff & WuDunn, this book is a wonderful follow up to Half the Sky. Their hard-hitting journalism is educational, enlightening, and sometimes brutally honest in their approach to women who are marginalized, abused, ignored, neglected, suppressed here and in developing countries. A must reading for anyone who wants to make a difference in the world, one woman at a time.",1428969600,5,385,5.225806451612903
6951023,5,B00S2SYPSK,"""A Path Appears"" is a brief series of 3 episodes that first aired on PBS in 2015, and each episode is simply riveting. It's among the best programs I've seen on PBS in a long time.

The stories are captivating and heart wrenching. They can be very hard to watch and some of the outcomes are unexpected, but each draws you in. Clearly, the issues are very complex and feel a bit oversimplified when it comes to the solutions presented t multi-faceted problems. Nonetheless, I think the point is not the solutions themselves or the celebrities included in the stories, but rather to motivate the viewer to become active in the issues that engage them personally.

Despite how challenging it is to watch at times, the only thing wrong with ""A Path Appears"" is that you'll want to watch more.",1425686400,12,788,4.621428571428571
6951024,5,B00S2SYPSK,"I want to congratulate the team at Show of Force for a job REALLY well done on A Path Appears.  I thought last night's Atlanta story was particularly well handled. The domestic violence advocate was incredible. And I was completely riveted by the mens group footage. I felt like I was seeing something on television for the first time. To hear these men describe what they had done, and to see the non-recognition that what they were doing constituted abuse  this is verite filmmaking at its best. And when the leader of the mens group said we always try to pretend this is about individual bad men, but its really society that permits this kind of thing to continue: this is so powerful. Thank you for bringing this to a wider audience.",1424822400,11,737,4.575757575757576
6951025,5,B00S2SYPSK,"A thoughtful, consciousness-raising examination of a pervasive issue that is easy for most of us to want to overlook. This documentary establishes beyond a doubt that sex trafficking is not and never has been a victimless crime and that incest, rape and abuse are widely used as methods of control which contribute toward intergenerational poverty and often substance abuse. Gender violence affects every nationality, ethnicity, class and disturbingly every age and this film demonstrates both the problems and many of the solutions with sensitivity and reflection. Never patronizing, this film provides opportunity for survivors, many of them still children, to tell their own stories as they seek to reclaim their lives. I was initially skeptical of the inclusion of celebrities but they serve the purpose of the film beautifully as proxies for us the viewers in experiencing deep levels of shock, consternation and compassion, by turn, and as both witnesses of profound suffering and advocates for meaningful intervention and social change. This film honors the true value and dignity of women and girls and magnificently humanizes not only survivors but also the activists and educators, many of them also survivors, who are creating real change in the face of an enormous problem that, if not physically, subliminally affects every one of us.",1423699200,16,1347,5.3584905660377355

8697153,5,B00S2SYPSK,"This is well made and packed full of information and stories that have moved me very deeply.  One of my favorite parts happens in a classroom where children are being taught their strength, value, and worth.  There is such joy in their midst!  I couldn't keep the smile off my face as I listened to the children repeat after their teacher and watched them put on a presentation in their classroom that is priceless!  They are changing their futures and the futures of the coming generations.  But, in the mean time, they are also rescuing, educating, and helping to heal the wounded, distressed, and abused.  I have watched this several times and even so, it remains a go-to DVD to both experience, for myself, and to loan out to others.",1503878400,,737,4.630769230769231
8697154,5,B00S2SYPSK,"Shed great light on a very necessary (and grossly underreported) issue -- of all the incredible damage being done to generations of women.  It was especially horrifying to begin to understand the impact on the totality of any quality of life such abuses can have, and how poisoned all the positive possibilities their lives contain can become.  The world can never change until the quality of life of the most vulnerable among us changes.  This video was incredibly important in showing not only the need but also the insightful genius of the caring hearts among us to seek to make a difference in the parts of the world in which they live.  Totally impressed and inspired by the viewpoints of the people that looked at these issues and lives and were not as influenced by the daunting challenges as they were by the great possibilities that success could have on the lives of the women (and children and communities) in need.  Very moving!",1503360000,,940,4.742331288343558
