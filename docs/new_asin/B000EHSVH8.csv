2521488,5,B000EHSVH8,"I was wondering when they would release R&RHS Forever on DVD.  I had this movie on video tape but could never find it and possibly presumed it was erased by accident.  It looks obvious South Beach Academy would be the double feature because Corey Feldman was also in it.

R&R HS Forever may not have measured up to the original that is now a movie classic, but what drew me, and still does, is just how catchy the music was with Feldman and the Eradicators.  I'll admit, Feldman looked like he was trying to channel the now infamous Michael Jackson during his Black/White days, but the group as a whole was great to listen to.  I heard a soundtrack was suppose to have been released to coincide with the movie, but Feldman got in some trouble, and the plan was scrapped.  Give this movie a try, and try not to compare it to the original...no one can ever replace the Ramones.  They were a class act within themselves.",1140220800,7,917,4.4226190476190474

2521493,4,B000EHSVH8,Love rock and roll high school forever as the campy sequel to the original. But man I only made it about 10 minutes into south beach academy before I had to turn it off. The fact that there were shots used at least five times each made it a struggle to watch and the opening just made no sense. Also it's creepy to watch the grandpa from Adams family groping young girls.,1419638400,,371,4.166666666666667

2521502,3,B000EHSVH8,"These are obviously moves that flopped, and if you're buying this item, most likely it's for one movie or the other -- and you oddly have unique liking for one of these movies, and wanted it digital. The transition of these movies is OK to a digital, but the box advertises ""digital mastering"", which i'm thinking means that they simply copied it to a DVD without any improvements to the picture. Compared to a VHS, it's a great picture, but if you're hoping for an upgraded viewing experience, then don't raise your expectations, still a great deal for the price, and glad to retire the VHS version of Rock'n'Roll High!!",1389139200,2,621,4.654545454545454

2521509,5,B000EHSVH8,Two of feldmans best movies by far!!! Rock n roll high school 2kids was great. His first direct to video movie after getting caught with heroin and going to rehab! Of course it was all downhill from there movie wise but still a great fun movie! And south beach was one that he didn't star in but was in it alot none the less. Great fun movie as well. Amd one of the last movies feldman did that he co stared in for about 10it years till lost boys 2. Both great fun!!!!!! Buy this dvd,1355875200,,483,4.041666666666667

2521511,5,B000EHSVH8,"The Corey Feldman remake of Rock N Roll High School was panned as the film that killed his movie career.  That is sad.  This was one of my favorite movies in high school.  Yes, it is schlocky and warped, but it also has that typical 80's charm of being over the top that made so many of those movies so fun to watch.  No to mention the awesome cameo part by Mojo Nixon.  If your film ain't got Mojo Nixon then it sure could use some fixin'!  Regardless, if you like corny 80's flicks with idiotic humor and people thinking mullets are cool, do yourself a favor and check this overlooked classic out!",1354752000,4,599,4.256637168141593
2521512,3,B000EHSVH8,"Rock 'N' Roll High School Forever is definitely the better film included here. And it just proves that a ton of bare breasts can't compare to Mary Woronov playing an evil principal. You see, South Beach Academy has a ton of nudity. So much so in fact, that it becomes boring. However, Rock 'N' Roll High School is funny, cool, and silly fun!",1303430400,,341,4.428571428571429

you'll probably hate it if you don't like cheesy movies, so i wouldn't even give it a shot.  if you like goofy movies with a sense of humor and fun, you'll love this!  not to mention corey feldman singing, dancing, running around and being silly.  it's got a lot of cute details and just seems like a fun movie to have been involved with.

2521516,5,B000EHSVH8,"I've been looking for this 90's classic for years!!! I was so suprised to find ""Rock and Roll High School Forever"" along with another film as a Red Carpet Double Feature brand new and factory sealed for a measly $3.99 at a Bi Lo store when I was visiting SC,I bought it in a heartbeat! I had RNRHSF on VHS a while back and it got eaten(oh the horror!)Well it got it on crystal clear DVD,with even another Corey Feldman movie,South Beach Academy,this is pretty standard T&A fare,with some great acting talent behind it,something you would see on HBO late at night,not something I would watch more than once! Both films are presented Full Frame buts thats more than likely the way they were filmed. Rock and Roll High School Forever stars Corey Feldman,Sarah Buxton,Mojo Nixon,the great late Larry Linville,and cult queen Mary Woronov as Vader,she was in the original Rock N Roll High School in a very somilar role as Togar,a very underated actress! South Beach Academy also stars Feldman along with cult actors James Hong and the great late Al Lewis,FYI former adult film star Ron Jeremy appears also under different name. A great Corey Feldman Double Feature! A+",1239753600,,1162,4.786069651741293
2521517,2,B000EHSVH8,"Rock n Roll High School Forever - Broadly, this film is about a group of rebellious teenagers, led by Corey Feldman (wearing clothes that look like they were stolen from Michael Jackson), who seek to reclaim their high school from the evil Vice Principal, Dr. Vader, through practical jokes and rock n roll. However, it took me most of this film's 95 minute duration to figure that out. What this film really is, is a series of semi-connected episodes featuring either Feldman and his friends playing pranks or Feldman and his band singing. Although, as a whole, the film is a bit of a disjointed mess, the individual episodes are pretty funny (my favourite was a scene in which one of the character is meant to give a book review of ""Heart of Darkness"" and instead described ""Apocalypse Now""), and the songs are good toe-tapping tunes (many sung by Feldman himself) that make me wish that a soundtrack had been released.

For those who have seen the original ""Rock n Roll High School"", the connections between these two films are slight, and the original film is by far the superior of the two, which may lead to some disappointment. However, if you try to see this as a stand-alone film in its own right, then you will probably enjoy it a lot more - 3 stars.

South Beach Academy - This film about two brothers: one of whom must save his uncle's beach academy from being lost in a bet over a game of beach volley ball; the other (played by Corey Feldman) whose main goal in life is to lose his virginity; is just one big excuse for virtually non-stop nudity. Most of the film takes place either on the beach, where women are constantly walking around topless, or in a strip-club, where Feldman spends most of his time acting like a sleaze. Presumably the makers of this film thought that all of the faults in this film's script could be hidden behind naked women, and there are a lot of faults in the script. This is a boring, unfunny, waste of time that becomes sleazier and sleazier with each passing minute.

By the time this film was made, Feldman had ceased to be the lovable teen actor and is actually quite revolting. One scene, in particular, in which his character has a pornographic fantasy in the strip club, makes him seem incredibly creepy. I would say that this film is only for fans of Feldman, but even they might prefer to give this one a miss - 1 star.",1236038400,,2372,4.4988399071925755
2521518,5,B000EHSVH8,"I adore R&RHSF, always have. still looking for the music as that is a big draw, aside from how hawt Corey is in the film. What can i say? i love the hair! The movie is about 5 troublemaking bandmates whose hijinks land them a new VP in charge of discipline. Now they have to fight the opression of the music hateing hag and save the school from the uncool. And of course, get the girls along the way. if you like cheesy spoofs and outrageous pranks, buy this movie now! or if you like a shirtless Corey Feldman.... mmmmm shirtless....

8110406,5,B000EHSVH8,Rick and roll high school is an awesome movie. First saw it when I was a kid on HBO back in the day I recorded it on VHS and watched it until the tape wore out.  Now I have it on dvd whenever I'm home sick I pop that bitch on and it makes me feel better.,1475020800,,254,3.456140350877193
8110407,3,B000EHSVH8,"I'm a bit biased due to being a two Corey's fan, and Rock n Roll High School Forever is a great movie. Many people will disagree, but I found it to be awesome. As a kid, I loved this movie when it first came out. This is the first time I've watched it since then, and it still sits well with me. The antics are silly, the plot is not the greatest, but if you're looking for a fun way to just kill an afternoon of boredom, you should definitely try out this movie.

It has all of the late 80s/early 90s transition cheese that you would expect, and of course it's lovable. Feldman's performance isn't that bad, and the cast meshes pretty well with each other. Is it the best sequel to the classic? Eh, it could've been a bit better, but it definitely does the sequel justice.

South Beach Academy on the other hand, I turned off after 5 minutes. I just couldn't do it, and not just because it was inappropriate to be watching with my four-year-old in the room. It was just awful.",1463270400,3,977,4.219251336898396
