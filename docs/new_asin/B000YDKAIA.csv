8232111,3,B000YDKAIA,"""Junior G-Men"" is a serial released by Universal in 1940 starring The Dead End Kids and The Little Tough Guys, directed by Ford Beebe and John Rawlins.  The plot is pre-war propaganda, with ""The Order of the Flaming Torch,"" headed by a man named Brand (Cy Kendall), working with a foreign government and planning to ""overthrow the social order"" of the United States.  They have abducted several scientists who could help their cause.  Fortunately for our heroes, the enemy agents have their emblem, a ""flaming torch"" tatooed on their wrists, making them fairly easy to spot.  Billy Barton (Billy Halop) is caught for raiding a bakery truck through fingerprint identification by Junior G-Man Harry Trent (Kenneth Howell) but is soon released.  Billy and his street gang, including Gyp, Terry and Lug (Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell and Bernard Punsley) seek revenge and get into a brawl at the Junior G-Men's meeting house, but when Billy's identity is revealed FBI agent Jim Bradford (Phillip Terry), Harry Trent's uncle, takes custody of the troublemakers instead of turning them over to the police.  Billy is eventually encouraged to work with the FBI and ""the coppers"" because his long lost father, Colonel Barton (Russell Hicks) is believed a prisoner of the ""Torch Gang"" owing to his invention of a powerful explosive.

Along the way to rounding up the ""Torchies"" there are plenty of fist fights, explosions, fires, padding and stock footage, assembled with Universal's usual skill.  The story is treated seriously, with occasional humor provided by the antics of the Dead End Kids, and while there are a few appearances of female characters, none are involved much in the plot.  A fairly ""average"" Universal serial of the time, but the story moves along well, without too many side excursions, and with some familiar cliffhangers seen in other Universal serials, including a falling elevator and the imploding building used later in ""Gang Busters"" and ""The Master Key.""

Alpha Video's edition is on two DVD's, the ""Complete Serial"" with catalog number 9540D is a shrink-wrapped package of the two volumes, ALP 4160D and ALP 4161D, also available seperately.  While it would win no prizes for picture or sound quality, it isn't bad for an Alpha release; the image is properly sized, clear if not terribly sharp and with adequate gray scale in the chapters themselves, where the sound is also quite adequate for the dialogue, if a little lacking in high frequencies.  The opening credits are worse; all appear to be from the same chapter, the image slightly fuzzy with low contrast, and the sound has more than a little distortion and flutter.  While the main title is headed by ""Universal Presents"" the credits appear to be from a re-release, having still-frame background pictures, and the cast list is presented in two parts instead of scrolling as seen in another print, which also had title music matching that used in the 1942 sequel ""Junior G-Men of the Air.""  The title music in the Alpha edition is the same used for ""The Great Alaskan Mystery.""  The ""next-week"" titles at the chapter ends were remade, noted as a ""Serials Incorporated Release.""  Once past the credits, both image and sound noticeably improve, though with the usual dirt, scratches and some splices of an ""unrestored"" film print.  The head-switching point glitch from the videotape source can be seen just above the blanking bar at the bottom of the frame, but the transfer appears to have been properly done.

So a watchable edition, if not something to show off a high-definition display, and while no great classic the serial is lively enough to maintain interest for the 20 minute run of each chapter, if watched with a day or more between them.  Quite reasonable at Alpha's price.",1301875200,3,3759,4.9856
8232112,5,B000YDKAIA,"I bought this two DVD set primarily to have a DVD version of one of the old serials that my father, actor Gene Rizzi, had performed in as the character Foster. In addition to being a great family archive, it also proved to be very entertaining with rare views of various streets and scenes of a bygone Hollywood. Although, much of the footage is reused in each episode, the scenes are still believable. What is hard to believe is that movie goers actually came back to the theater week after week to see how each cliff hanging episode was resolved. Simple times, a simple Hollywood.... These episodes are remarkably preserved and are most notable for the appearance of the ""Dead End Kids."" They are both entertaining as well as being a great example of a time when Hollywood was uncomplicated and straightforward.",1294531200,6,813,4.732394366197183
