330776,4,6301327691,"RKO Radio Pictures present ""JOHNNY ANGEL"" (1945) (79 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Starring George Raft, Claire Trevor, Signe Hasso, Lowell Gilmore & Hoagy Carmichael --- Directed by Edwin L. Martin and released in December 27, 1945, our story line and film, this is a twisty plotted film noir involving smugglers and a double-cross that is set on the dimly lit docks and in the swinging French Quarters of New Orleans. George Raft plays his trademark tough guy role to perfection, as the sea captain  Johnny Angel who works for the Gustafson Steamship Line, where his father also works as a captain. Johnny discovers in the sea fog a ghost ship and is alarmed to find no crew and a ship that shows signs of a battle taking place, as it's riddled with bullet holes and broken furniture is strewn across the deck while its cargo of African mahogany is still suspiciously on board. It's an intriguing film noir tale about avenging a murder of a loved one, a femme fatale getting her man to do her foul deeds, and of the two men struggling to hold their own against the gigantic shadows of their fathers.

Farrell MacDonald (Capt. Angel), Mack Gray (Mack, the Bartender)  - - - - - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic...Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s...Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hard-boiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression...the term film noir (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs..the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film ... featuring top performances from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays, along with a wonderful cast and supporting actors to bring it all together ... another winner from the vaults of almost forgotten film noir gems

7811907,5,6301327691,"George Raft around this time was starting to spiral down from his career peak. After turning down many roles like High Sierra, Casablanca, and The Maltese Falcon to Humphrey Bogart a man he disliked who ultimately became the biggest movie star in history George Raft is often forgotten and dismissed as a good actor. Many forget his great films Scarface, They Drive By Night, Each Dawn I Die, Background to Danger, Invisible Stripes and Manpower.
  Johnny Angel is one of his most underrated movies. Johnny Angel sets out to learn who hijacked a gold shipment from his father's ship and killed his father, the captain. He is joined in the search by Paulette, whose own father has been killed by the hijackers. It's a good film noir and great mystery. Raft has some good fighting scenes which are good. Academy Award Winner Claire Trevor adds a lot to this film in a small supporting role she was a great actress. Signe Hasso was gorgeous and I thought she did a great female lead opposite Raft as the woman who knows more than she is willing to tell in solving the mystery. Unlike a lot of George Raft movies there is a good supporting cast around him so he doesn't have to carry the film. I thought this was just a great film. Hasso and Raft have great chemistry. Trevor did great in her part. I hope this movie comes to dvd because it is better than some of the other George Raft movies they have started releasing. Cheers!",1374278400,5,1425,4.51937984496124
7811908,4,6301327691,"JOHNNY ANGEL (1945) would have a better status today, if it wasn't for its Gangster Theme Title.  The Danish Title `Gold From Casablanca' would have been a far better marketing handle.  The film's plot is written well.  All three writers, who contributed to the script, are renowned for their work in Film-Noir:  Frank Gruber - The Mask of Dimitrios (1944), Charles G. Booth - The House on 92nd Street (1945) & Steve Fisher - Dead Reckoning (1947).  The film's Cinematographer Harry J. Wild is also well-known for his great work in the Film-Noirs Murder, My Sweet (1944) & Macao (1952).  There are excellent Character Actors who have appeared over the years in several of Humphrey Bogart's Great WWII Adventure/Film Noir Flicks - Claire Trevor - Key Largo (1948), Hoagy Carmichael -To Have and Have Not (1944) & Martin Miller - Dead Reckoning (1947).  JOHNNY ANGEL is a Great `B' that garnered `A' returns for RKO Radio Pictures, it should be made available on DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Angel-VHS/dp/6301327691/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Angel [VHS</a>]",1367193600,3,1115,5.562130177514793
7811909,5,6301327691,"A good story and fine supporting cast surround George Raft in this easy to take RKO mystery. Based on Charles Gordon Booth's 'Mr. Angel Comes Aboard' this was a perfect fit for Raft. Casting him as a ship's Captain in New Orleans investigating his father's abandoned vessel allowed his somewhat wooden acting style to mesh with the character. The atmosphere of the French Quarter and a lovely Signe Hasso keep things interesting for mystery fans, and photographer Harry S. Wild gives the film a nice look.

The S.S. Emeline is discovered afloat with no hands onboard while on route back to New Orleans from Casablanca. Johnny Angel (George Raft) attempts to discover what happened, knowing his father, the Captain, would not have been involved in anything shady. He tracks down a female stowaway named Paulette (Signe Hasso), but she bolts before Angel can get a handle on what's going on. Songwriter Hoagy Carmichael had one of his colorful supporting turns as easygoing cabbie Celestial. He gets to sing 'Memphis in June' while helping both Angel and Paulette; the latter when someone tries to do away with her.

That 'someone' doesn't want Angel to know what his father took onboard or what happened once he did. Once Paulette learns she can trust Johnny things point to the Jewel Box, a nightclub run by Sam Jewel (Lowell Gilmore) which is frequented by Lilla (Claire Trevor), the wife of his boss, Gusty (Marvin Miller). She has the hots for Johnny who plays along while he stashes Paulette with Celestial. A double cross over gold and a momma's boy at his breaking point make for a good climax to the mystery, while director Edwin L. Marin lets romance have the last word.

Signe Hasso is easy on the eyes and acquits herself nicely for this type of film, while Raft is solid in a role well suited to his acting style. Margaret Wycherly also does a nice job portraying Gusty's assistant and mother figure. Just enough action peppers this atmospheric mystery to merit it being classed as a real winner in the genre. The opening music by Leigh Harline is beautiful, and Roy Webb's score highlights a nice romantic subplot between Johnny and Paulette. Hoagy Carmichael's pencil propeller will leave an impression and set this above many others in the cycle. An RKO classic.",1266883200,10,2276,4.8307692307692305
