8718998,5,B00YSFZBCK,This series is so well researched and written.  Very enjoyable.  Just wish it did not end after the 3rd season.  A mixture of recent events and characters who are interesting and changing. Gave me insight into some people I know.,1511136000,,229,4.675
8718999,5,B00YSFZBCK,"Absolutely fabulous! Terrific writing and a great cast make this series a must see. Based upon actual events, this news organization is determined to get the real news to the public, instead of going for ratings and what might otherwise generate income for the corporate owners. Interesting relationships develop between the cast members; integrity is ever present as the moral compass of the players; and a sense of urgency keeps pushing the news at a fast clip. Possibly the best tv series to binge on!",1487808000,,504,4.9411764705882355
