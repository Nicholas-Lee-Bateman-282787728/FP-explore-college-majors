8471801,4,B005GL2B00,"The film: I can't really call it a departure for Crialese, seeing as it was his first feature film, but it lies firmly in the realm of romantic comedy, a genre which he really has not addressed in his subsequent three films. Even so, the plot unfolds against a background theme of immigrants in a strange and faraway land, a theme that only strengthens in his more recent films. The first major scene is a heart-stealer, with a hilarious confrontation verging on the Cleesian. Antonio is the sensitive Italian cook working in a New York restaurant, somewhat of a purist when it comes to the cuisine that is his passion. His reverence for the authentic fettucine alla carbonara collides with a pompous ass of a customer (American) who insists on ""having it his way,"" and worse, impugns Antonio's culinary knowledge and even his manhood (""Beh, ti chiamano Tony, s?""). From there, the sparks fly, some of them destined to ignite a romance with the man's dinner companion, a romance seemingly doomed when she receives a transfer to Paris. Antonio's friend Apu, on the other hand, has his own romantic problems, in a sense just the opposite. Apu has long since been assimilated into American culture when his arranged, and rather provincial, bride arrives from India. He finds cultural conflict within his relationship, while his reluctant spouse has many befuddling and amusing encounters with the American way of life.

The edition: this Videa-CDE S.p. A. DVD appears to be the only release made of Once We Were Strangers. Unfortunately, its technical qualities are sadly deficient. First, the picture is infested with artifacts: jaggies, shimmers, and bright areas, like the sky and reflected sun-glare, that render as a monotone magenta, of all things. Contrast is weak. In addition, the claimed 16/9 aspect ratio is a fraud: it's really a small 4/3 image cropped within a 16/9 frame and surrounded by broad black bars on all 4 sides, which wastes about half the screen real estate of an HDTV. On the other hand, I'm not sure that enlarging this poor image would be wise, as the flawed picture quality would only become more obtrusive. Finally, the sound track sounds flat and compressed. These faults, combined with the reported total absence of this film from Italian movie theaters, do a severe injustice to this little-seen gem. Are you listening, Criterion?
