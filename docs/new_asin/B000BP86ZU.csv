8090475,5,B000BP86ZU,Yes a good segment of videos of the series not the typical kiddy nonsense and certainly a good purchase of anime.,1382054400,,113,4.428571428571429
8090476,3,B000BP86ZU,"Well...I guess this will be my first negative review of this series. Though Volume 3 wasn't horrible, it just wasn't up to par with the previous 2. We ended the last volume finally hitting the main stride of the series as the pirates of Aurora find out that the legendary treasure of Mars is real and with Grahms pendant and the Box of Knowledge they can find it. Let the adventure begin right? Volume three says, not so fast. After the first episode of the Aurora fleeing the aboriginal city ship, they are slowed down not really by the Earth ships but 2 following filler episodes. Thankfully all the main players finally assemble again in the final episode with a huge battle and with what happens to Vestimona at the end, gives me hope that the next volume will be better. Although she was in the first and last episode I still missed her. We really don't know a lot about her and what her backstory is with Grahm. Instead of filler episodes, the writers need to get with the program with their past together.  Vestimona yelling at Grahm everytime about being a pirate and that his life could be better is past its limits. Luckily it looks like we will finally see some more backstory, after seeing Grahm loose it when they couldn't go back to rescue her at the end of the final episode. All in all the series is still a good one. I know just about every anime series has filler episodes, and if Mars Daybreak has anymore, hopefully they will at least be more interesting or action packed. Who knows maybe the Ghost ship and the bride in distress will actually become a bigger part of the story.",1171238400,,1598,4.453924914675768
