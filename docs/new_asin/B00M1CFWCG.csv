The movie had elements of racism mixed with bashing of the United States and other countries.

I wanted to like the movie for it's overarching theme but the unessary display of racism and xenophobia is not appropriate for anyone in my opinion and certainly not kids.",1495843200,,317,4.543859649122807

8669625,5,B00M1CFWCG,"This is a cute animation movie with a Thai cultural twist, and with kids saving the world from global warming ! Safe and fun entertainment for kids. To the right wing brainwashed: The rest of the world is already far ahead addressing global warming. It is a firm scientific fact that warming happens and that its cause is human fossil fuel consumption. Sorry, but you are hopelessly behind and, by denying scientific facts you are making it worse. Please spare your kids from a fate of global devastation.",1438992000,3,505,4.75
