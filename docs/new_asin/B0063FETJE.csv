4935471,5,B0063FETJE,"I actually started watching this series through Netflix but once I got hooked, I realized that the rest of the seasons were hard to find in the US.  I tried several different venues, but Amazon is the only one that I found that carried seasons 2, 3, and 4.  It bothers me that the new season is airing in Canada and I don't have access to it (must be my instant-gratification-American complex)!  Hopefully, Amazon will carry the DVDs for Season 5 once it comes out too!

It's a good family show that is well-acted (can't say that about some American shows!).  I really started watching it for the horses but now love the characters.  They fight, they make up; they make poor choices, they learn from their mistakes.  Its great TV!  Anyone who at least wanted to grow up around horses should enjoy this.",1329955200,8,802,4.520833333333333
4935472,3,B0063FETJE,"I purchased Heartland videos because I love open country and horses. I do find Heartland to be an overall charming and interesting series. Sometimes with a touch of soap opera. The characters are well chosen. Though, it is negative that in some parts shamanim is implied and suggested. As the series may continue I hope it will promote the values of family, faithfulness, trust and joy.

4935557,1,B0063FETJE,I give this series 5 Stars as it's really wonderful and well worth watching. The 1 star rating is only for the very poor DVD quality as the image is grainy which is quite disappointing. I would not recommend buying this particular production.

She has totally fallen in love with it. Everything was fine until I put in season 4 & than OMG, it is the exact duplicate of season 3. Sooo here I am not only with two season 3, but am out another $32.??. Am hoping that you will let me return season 4 & credit the amount back 2 my account. Thru researching other reviews I found out this has happened to many others. It seems like you would correct this. Also season 5 seems to pick up where season 3 leaves off.

4935586,5,B0063FETJE,"I do love this series however the producers of the boxed sets of Heartland have been somewhat crafty at best downright devious at worst. The episodes shown on this particular set are already on ""Season 3""!!!
""Season 1"" - contains seasons 1 and most of 2.
""Season 2"" - contains the rest of season 2 and most of season 3.
""Season 3"" - contains the rest of season 3 and all of season 4.
HENCE ""SEASON 4"" IS OBSOLETE.
Season 5 - contains all of season 5 whilst Season 6 contains all of season 6.
The problems this creates - apart from making folks pay twice for the fourth season - are that whilst we could have returned this set fully packaged as bought, the only way to confirm the out and out ""error' is to open the set and see the names of the episodes and cross check it having begun to watch it and realised we had already seen it. Also aesthetically on our shelf it looks very odd to have Season 1,2,3,5, and 6. So now we have bought the lot we are rather stuck with them.
I trust the producers of these DVD's will take note of this and rectify the problem.",1404345600,,1060,4.150485436893204

For the Ultimate Discounts Canada (Red Top) seasons you have to buy seasons #1, #2, #3 & #4 in order to see the same 67 shows (13-18-18-18 = 67 shows. Do not mix the Orange and Red Top seasons.

4935706,5,B0063FETJE,"This series is wonderful! I found this while stationed in Italy on Amazon - it was recommended to me based on my other TV show choices. And after the very first episode, I was hooked. I have the first three series then took a break after the baby was born and going back to work was too much for TV watching! I don't know if I have the American or Canadian versions so I ordered this to see if it would work for me (I think I have the American releases based on the covers and other rater comments - thanks for those). I will order the rest after that.  I am glad the series is still on - it is hard to find good family viewing where cussing and violence are not the norm but things are so rosy and sweet that you get sick from all the suger.

4935708,5,B0063FETJE,This series is a very good family type show.  There may be some who object to some mild swearing of the Lord's name - I am just giving that warning.

The packaging on these series is great, I love the cases and the photo art and the otter box.

Many people have already done reviews of the series, I'll just say a few things about the fourth season. It is a bit drama filled at times but it keeps the same heart the show has always had.

4935853,5,B0063FETJE,"I gave this 5 stars because this is the best program I've seen in quite awhile and it showed up quickly and in excellent condition.

Delivery & Quality: The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. It is a cardstock box with an opening at one end for thin, plastic dvd holders to insert in and the pictures are of good quality.

The Show: I started watching this show on Netflix and was so hooked that when they cut off mid 3rd season (one thing I hate about Netflix), I decided to just get all the DVDs so that I could continue to enjoy this program. It's about a teenage girl whose mother died and is being reared by her grandfather on a horse ranch with her sister and other characters. Her job is working with the horses as she has a special gift and understanding for them. There are many characters in the show that you'll get used to and know who they are (although new characters get introduced, there is none of this constant changing of characters like I've seen in some programs). This show is also full of adventure, love of family, and respectfulness as well as romances and life challenges. All-in-all an excellent show",1371859200,,1139,4.471153846153846

4935863,5,B0063FETJE,I can't get enough of it. Amy and Ty relationship. Malory is funny and she puts it to them all the time. But overall this series is good to watch with family. Can't wait for next season!,1368403200,,186,4.054054054054054
4935864,5,B0063FETJE,"I love this show because it is all about life in the country and horses.  It's also about a family who experiences many kinds of trials and tribulations and how they are able to resolve and rise above them.  It primarily about a young girl who loses her mother and how she copes with this loss and becomes stronger.  She also shares a gift her mother had with horses.  So there are a lot of horses, along with cattle, and cattle drives, but mostly about the interactions of all the characters in the show, with Amy being central.  I would add that this was filmed in Canada, just east of the Rocky Mountains.  So there is some fabulous scenery, and the ranch is this country girls dream.  I would recommend this for the entire family.",1368057600,,734,4.392592592592592

Why can't network/cable television in the United States produce something that families can watch together?  I watched the first three seasons on Netflix and couldn't wait for the next season to be posted out to Netflix.  My 18-year-old daughter told us about this show.  She really enjoys this show and we sit down and watch it together as a family.  We love horses, but you don't have to be a horse person to enjoy the story.

4935924,1,B0063FETJE,"I own EVERY Season of Heartland on DVD and every single set I have owned (bought brand new mind you) has been terrible quality. The characters look grainy and the colors are very washed out. The odd thing is that the episodes on Netflix are almost HD quality so I don't get it. It seems as though whomever is converting it to the dvds is doing a shoddy job.

My husband walked in while I was watching (he is an Engineer) and said ""Wow, that looks like a VHS"" and that is exactly what it looks like. We have two HD TVs and I have watched it on both TVs and still the same results. I think they are cutting corners and using a crappy company to do their conversions. I feel a little ripped off to be honest. Especially since I am such a loyal fan and this is one of the biggest shows in Canada so its not like they are low on budget. If you can get your episodes any other way Netflix, iTunes, etc...I would do that. I know its nice to have the box sets , but believe me when I say its not worth the $45.

Unfortunately I live in the US so I have no choice, but to buy the box sets since Netflix takes forever to post the seasons up and apparently there is a Canadian iTunes and a USA iTunes so it won't let me buy the episodes through their because they are only offered to Canadians.

If you have a choice skip the DVDS as they are terrible quality. I actually just bought Season 5 and its so grainy that I have been watching it on YouTube, thats how sad it is. I own the Dvds and I am having to resort to YouTube to watch it because the quality is so annoying. I even played one episode on Netflix on one TV and then the exact same episode from the DVD on my other TV and the difference in quality was astounding!! The Netflix version had vibrant colors and no graininess and the DVD version was very washed out (think VHS from the 90's).",1348876800,,1839,4.032876712328767
4935935,5,B0063FETJE,They come back in this season as good as ever. Story lines are good and exciting. Characters continue to evolve. This is worth the buy.,1348358400,,135,4.44
4935936,5,B0063FETJE,It is one of the best family shows that has ever been shown on TV. Just brillant can you tell me when 5 Series will be shown. Gerry,1347926400,,131,3.7142857142857144
4935937,5,B0063FETJE,This series is simply amazing.  The character development is great and I find myself feeling like I really know them.  The scenery makes me want to drop everything and move to Alberta.  The work with the horses is believable and they are beautiful to boot.  I wish it was shown here in the US as a primetime program.,1344297600,,316,4.396551724137931
4935938,5,B0063FETJE,"This is like the horse version of The Waltons.  The characters are real, warm, caring, yet they have their faults.  The vista's are magnificent!  A sense of humor is prevalent even in the most stressful, sad, or precipitous events.  Finally a series once again where you don't have to be afraid to let your children watch it.  Adult situations are handled with subtlety and in the background of the rich context of life.",1344211200,,420,4.698630136986301

4935941,5,B0063FETJE,"This spring, my sister and I saw a commercial on GMC (Gospel Music Channel) for a television show called Heartland that would be aired from the beginning of the series. We decided to watch and see if we liked it. We LOVE this show and watched each Wednesday night when two episodes were aired. Waiting for the next week was difficult, as the characters are so likable and the stories so well written and acted. I decided to purchase Seasons 1-4 so that we could watch whenever we wanted and not have to wait for Wednesday nights. There is never a dull moment as Amy's mother, Marion, is killed in an accident in the very first episode and she, and her sister, Lou, and their grandfather, Jack, have to keep Heartland ranch running. Ty and Mallory become important members of the Bartlett-Fleming family and Jack loves and guides all four of the younger characters. There are other characters that, in the beginning, you may not like, but will grow to love over time - Caleb and Ashley. We have watched every episode in Seasons 1-4 and can honestly say that there is not a single episode that we did not enjoy. Each one was excellent. We even purchased A Heartland Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. The viewer learns a lesson along with the characters as they work with the horses and each other that leaves you feeling good at the end of the hour. There are many shows on television today that have no plot or characters with any depth. Heartland certainly stands above so much of what is on television. It is something that anyone, young or old, can watch and enjoy. The location (Alberta, Canada, in the Rocky Mountains) is absolutely gorgeous as well and adds even more to the show. We cannot wait for the fifth season (and future seasons) and we will purchase the DVDs as soon as they are available.",1342310400,21,1816,4.556574923547401
4935942,5,B0063FETJE,"We began watching this series on Netflix and like it almost as much as we liked ""McCleod's Daughters."" After discovering the final two episodes of season three and season four were not available on Netflix, we ordered seasons 3 & 4 on DVD. It was soon obvious that many of the DVD and streaming episodes of the identical number are entirely different. Much of the 3rd season on DVD is completly different, although just as good. What is going on ?",1342310400,,447,4.530864197530864
4935943,5,B0063FETJE,Absolutely fantastic I just love this tv series. Can't stop watching once I start really draws you in. Give it a go I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised but perhaps watching from the beginning would be best - you don't want to miss the whole story!,1338681600,,254,4.3125

After looking everywhere online for a chance to watch an episode and youtube taking them off, I couldn't resist any longer, and went and bought them all up here on Amazon. I have never enjoyed a show more. It truly can bring an entire family into watching, as it has nothing in it to where I feel I have to shelid my little girl's eyes, nor do I even cringe. I love it, it's full of drama, romance, tons of humor and great horse stories and filming. It also creates something ALL of my family enjoys!
