2250808,5,B0007Y08LK,I love Clarissa Explains It All it was one of my favote Nickelodeon shows growing up. This show was wholesome & entertaining for childern of all ages & espeically teens. They should have the other Nickelodeon Tv Classics on DVD is Alex Mack & Are You Afriad Of The Dark. And I love Melissa Joan Hart that she did a great job playing Clarissa. Thanks for having Clarissa on DVD.I HAVE TO GET IT!!!!,1116460800,,397,4.378378378378378
2250809,5,B0007Y08LK,"Forget everything that you've seen on Nickelodean in the last six or seven years, and take a remarkable journey into what Nick used to be: a classic sitcom. Memories stand in my mind of a happier time, when ""Are You Afraid Of The Dark?"" was still showing new episodes and Lori Beth was still hitting the cocunts and giving us Vital Information on ""All That."" And somewhere in this brain of mine, I remember ""Clarissa."" A show about nothing that became a something in short time. This first season introduces us to the Darling family and, like most first season's, it starts off rocky but smoothes on through the next few years. Now, I can say ""Clarissa"" was not my all time favorite show, but the reason I am excited about this set is because it shows what might be in the not-so-distant future. However, on the whole, I think Paramount (our new-found leader in this TV-On-DVD obsessed world) has presented a great set that is easy to use and presents everything in a nice, orderly fashion. The mini-cases, which are now customary in these DVD sets, show descriptions for the episodes and features, and while the menus may be devoid of motion or special effects, they present to us the DVD's contents in a way that makes it easy to use. All in all, this set is a box of anticipation for what

Paramount's <-Rewind Collection my be sending our way in the future.",1116288000,10,1361,4.555102040816327
2250810,5,B0007Y08LK,"On Saturday nights in the '90s, I was about 7-10. For these three years that stick out in my memory, I used to watch SNICKelodeon, with All That! Are You Afraid of The Dark? and many more classics! The weekday was just as great. We had Alex Mack, Allen Strange, and, of course, Clarissa! I only faintly remember this show, but I remember it was something great! I hope to buy more classics in this NICKELODEON REWIND collection, and hope Nick doesn't screw it up like they have their network! If $30(With S/H) is too high, try eBay. Presale auctions are still going on, and there's always a chance Amazon goes out of stock, making you wait longer for this.",1116288000,2,656,4.475
2250811,5,B0007Y08LK,"Yay, Nickelodeon is finally bending to my whim!!  Having grown up in the 90's, I think I saw every episode of Clarissa ever made more than once.  I love all the Nickelodeon shows of that time and I am so glad that they are not going to be lost in oblivion.  I know I sound like a dork, but I will be totally reliving my childhood, which is what every wavering college student needs to do every once and a while :)",1115078400,8,413,4.012195121951219
2250812,5,B0007Y08LK,"As a teen in the 90's I loved loved loved Nick shows. This show, Pete and Pete, and Roundhouse are some of my all time favorite shows.  They need to release all the classic nick shows from the 90's so they can be enjoyed again.  I am buying this and PeteX2 as soon as they come out.",1114473600,3,282,3.9298245614035086
2250813,4,B0007Y08LK,"Just the mere fact that Nick is releasing these classic shows makes me HAPPY! What would make me happier *hint hint to those at Paramount* is if Roundhouse, the Saturday Night Live for kids-teens, was released. I LOVED both of these shows, (and others such as Wild N Crazy Kids) and I was majorly disappointed when they cancelled each and every one of my favorite shows (or changed them beyond recognition ex:All That) and replaced them with shows that, I felt, were stupid. Please bring back the classics on DVD or at least start airing them on TV for a whole new generation to enjoy (doing both of the above would be even better)!",1111968000,4,632,4.552631578947368
2250814,5,B0007Y08LK,"Current and future releases from this new Rewind Collection that Nickelodeon is releasing deserves its own locked and lighted display case that will stand about 10 feet tall in the rooms of many people who just can't grow up (just like me) and can't let Classic Nickelodeon go.

I encourage everybody that ever watched and loved these shows to buy them as soon as they are released because if they sell well, (according to TvShowsOnDvd.com) Nickelodeon is going to release other shows (beginning with Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Salute Your Shorts and You Can't Do That On Television). Other future releases I'm personally hoping for will be Welcome Freshmen, Hey Dude, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Doug, Rocko's Modern Life, All That (the original cast), Kenan & Kel, well, you Get The Picture (that show too!)

To put it simply, I would personally spend all of my life savings and risk not being able to go to work for a month because I have no gas from the money I spent on every show that ever aired on Nickelodeon (up to Figure It Out), after that, nothing does it for me.

Yep, Clarissa's coming to DVD. So, let's all wait until May 17th (which is now 2 very long months away) for this beautiful piece of angel exalted glory to be released.

And so, we wait...",1110758400,61,1269,4.528384279475983

2250822,3,B0007Y08LK,"The DVD set of Season One has all thirteen episodes. (No DVDs of the later seasons have been released.) But the packaging of the streaming ""seasons"" is different and will not please completists. Three stars because of the omissions; full packages with all the episodes would get four.

There are five streaming ""seasons"", each of which contain seven episodes. The graphics for some of the packages identify them as ""Best of Clarissa volume N"". None is a full package of episodes from one broadcast season. Streaming season 2 includes episodes from broadcast seasons 1 and 2; streaming season 3 has episodes from broadcast seasons 2 and 3. Aside from episodes being missing, all of the packages except volume 5 scrambles the order of the episodes. You can't get the entirety of any of the first four broadcast seasons even if you buy all five streaming packages, and there are no season 5 episodes at all.

Hulu packages the available episodes of Clarissa by broadcast season but does not have every episode. Notably, only three episodes from season 5 are available, and one of the season 1 episodes that is on the DVDs is missing.

2250823,5,B0007Y08LK,I'm so glad to own this DVD. However I don't know why the other seasons aren't being released. I don't want to download episodes and watch them on a computer. There were quite a lot of fun shows on Nickelodeon during the 90s and this was one of (if not the) best shows they had. Not only do people my age remember and love the show but also people younger than me loved watching the reruns. This show is such a major staple in 90s pop culture. Anyway this DVD is nice and clear and shows off the shows vibrant colors. Each episode is fun and fast paced. Hopefully the whole show will come out on DVD someday.,1452988800,,608,4.161016949152542

It looks as if they transferred it to DVD straight from VHS. Now I understand that the show was originally recorded to video and not film, and is not in HD but they could have at least enhanced the image a little bit. It's as if Nickelodeon doesn't realize what they really have with all these old shows!

  This DVD is actually coming from Nickelodeon so I don't think you will be able to find a better quality DVD but for all it's worth it's not that bad. it's still watchable and I still highly recommend this DVD.

  I was having a sense of nostalgia and was getting really tired of all this new crap that's on TV currently. So, I bought all the seasons from all the old shows I used to watch on Nick, FOX, and ABC. So far Nick is the only one totally bias of it's past.

2250920,4,B0007Y08LK,"As I approached forty years of age in 1994 or so, I caught myself paying attention to popular shows favored by kids born in the late '70's to the late '80's.

Personally, I hadn't watched series television and had never subscribed to cable since the late '60's. Never was a fan of any particular program at that time but managed to catch a bit of cable programming while on the road working here and there. One of the ""new"" channels that caught my eye was Nickelodeon: Homesick, I found some of the shows comforting in a familia way.

Aside from the MTV, HBO, and Showtime cable-only channels vying for the adult market share, there was this different cable TV network of programming smart and sweet enough to be interesting to adults: Not too corny but just lightly gross enough for kids to have a laugh.

One example: ""Ren & Stimpy"". Or the series geared for the little kids that could identify with being the baby but also to their older brothers and sisters that considered babies ""Rugrats"".

As I watched more Nickelodeon in the mid '90's, I caught more programs. One favorite I added to my list of favorite Nick Flicks:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocko-s-Modern-Life-Season-One/dp/B004RBC5IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocko's Modern Life: Season One</a>, which has been recently issued on DVD but criticized for not looking too good on HDMI-equipped HD monitors.

That doesn't bother me that much. I can find an old CRT and the VHS tape to view ""Rocko's"" if need be. However, the lack of (at least) English subtitles bothers me more than video clarity and fidelity.

Which brings us to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarissa-Explains-It-All-Season-One/dp/B0007Y08LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarissa Explains It All - Season One</a>. ""Clarissa"" was an edgy, fast, wee bit naughty but mostly nice show about the age group of kids born in the late '70's. ""Clarissa"" was mostly fun times but interspersed with sincere moments of adolescent self-doubt to which even adults could relate.

Having bought most of my favorite Nick shows on VHS and the very long wait for one my very favorites (Rocko's, for example. I thought it was retired forever), I haven't been impressed with the Nickelodeon/Viacom treatment for re-issued DVD's and Blu-ray.

The not-so-improved picture quality: Most - if not all, are not in HD. (I could very well be wrong about this. And I'm not counting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rugrats-Season-1-3-Disc-Set/dp/B00264H48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rugrats Season 1 (3 Disc Set)</a>. The original cable series could be on Blu-ray; I know the Rugrat Movie DVDs are, at least, English subtitled)

There were so many cute programs in the Nickelodeon canon, many of which were not animated;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Pete-Pete-Season-1/dp/B0007Y08LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Pete & Pete - Season 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-Afraid-of-the-Dark-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000FNK6EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You Afraid of the Dark? - The Complete First Season</a>, and... Clarissa.

I remember my little 8 year-old niece asking me to watch ""Clarissa Knows It All"" with her to which I replied, ""Clarissa knows it *all*? This I have to see!""

My niece caught her slip and said with emphasis: ""Explains! Clarissa *explains* it all!""

I felt ashamed. She knew I knew what she was talking about but I had picked on her at her expense.

Trying to save face (impossible) I said, ""Well, Clarissa certainly knows a lot and if she doesn't know it all, she will try to figure it out and explain it.""

Hugs. Whew.

Gosh, how I miss Nick at Nite. I yearn for those wacky featurettes presented in a definitive HD-quality release with English subtitles. The subtitles are great if you want to watch the Nicks but with the sound off.

The Rugrats ate the headphones, you see, and all the old people are asleep.",1343088000,2,4108,5.776490066225166

This delightful child actress in the 80's and 90's was able to virtually be the sole star on her simple set at Nickelodeon, Orlando. She saw the world through a twelve year olds eyes in a wonderful typical way that was enjoyed by children and aduls alike. Her signature shrugy style and sweet disposition is timeless entertainment.

I used to like SpongeBob, but recently all the episodes have gotten ridiculous. Really, how many minutes can you take of SB crying over a spatula? Face it...you're out of ideas. Let it go already.

My daughter has also taken a liking to Cartoon Network b/c I won't let her watch Nick like she wants, which (if you ask me) is worse. Shows like Chowder (another weird character that CRYS and FARTS a lot), Total Drama Island and Ed, Edd & Eddie. KILL ME.

Nick needs to bring back the classics. They may be from the 90's, but at least they had a little class and you watch it as a family. I am (not so patiently) waiting for NICK to release Hey Dude and Salute you Shorts, because I know my daughter will love, love, LOVE it. And I know I can watch that again and again right along with her.

Additional Food for Thought: iCarly is the Clarissa for this generation. I'm just saying.

It's too bad you have to go to Nickelodeon and Disney channel to find shows about teenagers who are not drinking and seeping around.

The Nick time capsule highlighting what the network looked liked during 1991 - 1993, the time period when Clarissa first hit the air was a great feature.  All the season one episodes (13 total) were funny but the three that stood out were ""Clarissa Makes a Cake""; where she and her friend Sam attempt to make a cake for her parents' anniversary, ""Brain Drain""; where Clarissa's brother Ferguson scores high on an IQ test and the two siblings team up to compete on a quiz show (they lose) and ""School Picture"" where Clarissa, a true individual in the area of fashion, sets out to avoid dressing as her mother wants her to (""dweebie"" in her estimation).
I highly recommend this DVD to children and their parents. The writing is classic, not dated.  Clarissa is just as enjoyable in 2009 as in was in the early 1990's.

Melissa Joan Hart is a grate actress. She also looks the right age for the part. When I saw this on Amazon, I just had to have it. When I got it in the mail, I spent a few hours watching the episodes. It brought back a lot of Memories. I would recommend Clarissa to any woman or girl. Clarissa wasn't afraid to be herself, and she had her own fashion trend. What liked was that Clarissa and Sam were just friends. What I don't like about tv show now is that a guy and girl can't be friends. I give the special features 3 1/2 stars. I love the Nick time capsule. I didn't really care for the MTV Crib part. Their could have been more stuff for the special features. I love all the episodes and I give them 5 stars. I hope that season 2 comes out soon.

One person who was Clarissa Explains it all was Joe O'Connor, who played the father of the kid who kidnapped Salem.  He also played a Dean, tearing down houses in Sabrina Episode.  Two people I know who were discovered in the show was,Dawson's Creek James Van Der Beek, who Clarissa met in a party and Buffy the Vampire Slayer Michelle Trachtenberg.  One episode I remember Michelle Trachtenberg in, where Clarissa babysits the annoying little girl Elsie Soaperstein is the same episode I saw in Sabrina the Teenage Witch the doll story.  It was the episode where Sabrina babysits Amanda her annoying cousin that was played by Emily Hart, Melissa Joan Hart's sister.

I can't wait until Season Two is released, along with other Nick classics - Are You Afraid of the Dark, Salute Your Shorts, Hey Dude, etc. :)",1135641600,,740,4.951612903225806

2250999,5,B0007Y08LK,"As I read the reviews here first, I see that we are all in the same boat. People like me who watched this show more than 10 years ago and who still love it! I am approaching my 25th birthday, yet I still get a kick out of popping one of these dvds in and watching as many episodes in a row as I can.

I was waiting for what seems like forever for the DVD set to come out, and I am in 7th heaven now. This was one of many great Nickelodeon shows in the 90s and with sadness I see how shows like that are being replaced with empty and unmemorable garbage on tv. I also liked Pete&Pete, Afraid of the Dark, Salute your Shorts, Roccos Modern life, Doug and many others.

This show is just cute, funny, has interesting characters, Clarissa wears the craziest, coolest outfits, her room is embedded in my memory forever and the  computer games she would make and play still make me laugh. Her mom is still a health nut, her dad is just out there, her brother is a brat and her best friend is just chill.

No more waiting for reruns, with this DVD set you are in control of when and where you get you Clarissa dose.",1133481600,5,1108,4.068807339449541

2251001,5,B0007Y08LK,"I was SOOO excited to see they had started to bring shows like this and Pete and Pete to DVD.  I would give ANYTHING for shows like Hey Dude, Salute your Shorts, Rockos Modern Life, the Old Doug!  Originals!  Man, I miss my younger days =(",1125964800,5,239,4.1521739130434785
2251002,5,B0007Y08LK,"All I can say is just Wow!!! This used to be my favorite show. I see that many old shows are being repeated all over the cable e.g. full house, boy meets world, but the Nick shows are not being repeated. I could only find 4 episodes on videocasttes, which was good, but I wanted the entire show. I actually tried to find people who may have recorded it and were willing to send me a copy over message boards. But anyway, now I at least have the first season. I hope Nick releases the rest of the three seasons.",1122854400,2,510,4.11
2251013,4,B0007Y08LK,"All I have to say it's about time! This show was my first love (well besides You Can't Do That On Television) I grew up on the old school days of Nickelodeon.

This is a great start to a wonderful Nick collection! This includes two disks and includes episodes: Clarissa's Revenge, School Picture, No T.V., Urge To Drive, Clarissa News Network, Haunted House, The Bully, New Addition, Brain Drain, Clarissa Makes A Cake, Parent's Who Say No, Cool Dad, & Sick Days.

The only reason for 4 stars is I was *extremely* disappointed they didn't have the original credits in the early seasons. The one where she gets out of bed etc. Not to mention the small extra's such as: Melissa Joan Hart on MTV Cribs, & Nick Time Capsule (1991-1993). I hope in the following seasons we see more such as bloopers, interviews, and maybe some commentary or behind the scene's or information on the actors etc.

However, this show is a timeless classic. I've always wanted to have a room, and dress like Clarissa when I was younger and in my teen years. The show has everything: A nice loving family - classy and fun Janet (Elizabeth Hess) and architect Marshall (Joe O'Connor) as Clarissa's loving parents. Ferguson (Jason Zimbler) is Clarissa's annoying and genius little brother. Not to mention Sam (Sean O'Neal), Clarissa's best friend and neighbor.

The show has everything a teen and young girls can relate to. It's light hearted and has some fun educational messages. The chemistry of the cast is wonderful and they all help balance each other out. This is great for either the young adults or the entire family to enjoy.

And most assuredly a favorite classic Nickelodeon show!",1120867200,7,1663,4.760416666666667
2251014,5,B0007Y08LK,"Fun collection of episodes from one of Nickelodeon's best shows. Melissa Joan Hart did an excellent job portraying Clarissa. The show had a wit and irony about it that I loved. Also loved the way Clarissa dressed, her unique fashion sense and how she dealt with all the problems she had as a teenager in a funny way that gave advice at the same time. Theres 2 disks in this set-

Disc One Season One

Also contains Special Features of Melissa John Hart on MTV Show Cribs. A Nick Time Capsule. 1991-1993. Full screen format/ Dolby Digital.

Overall cool collection of episodes. Highly Recomended.

I also recomended Pete & Pete Season One.",1119398400,78,2359,4.508235294117647
2251015,5,B0007Y08LK,"As many have commented before me, I was a huge Clarissa fan. I wanted her cool room, her cool parents, and her bravado to do as she wanted fashion wise. I just wanted to be just like her.

So when I found out that this was coming out on dvd, I can't wait to own future collections of Nick Rewind series.

The package is pretty good. I only own one other t.v show by season (Punky) so i'm not sure if the packaging is standard. Two dvd's in two seperate cases in a less then sturdy box. But hey, you shouldn't just be buying this for the case.. right?

The presentation was great quality, surprisingly. I did not like the forced preview's and tried to get to the main menu, but alas you have to sit though them if you want to get to the episodes. The real gem (aside from the episodes themselves) was the time capsule. I sat my siblings down and made them watch them actually and they couldn't believe that they could remember them.

 The MTV cribs was out of place, as someone has said before me. I don't know why they thought we would want to see Melissa Joan Hart go on about her love of Gin and Shirley Temple. It's far removed from Clarissa herself and thus.. not exactly meant to be in this collection.

I'm glad I made this purchase definetly. Please go ahead and order it. The more popular the better chance of future collections!",1118534400,5,1337,4.264822134387352
2251016,5,B0007Y08LK,"I loved this show starring the best actress ever ""Clarista Flockheart"". She really does explain it all. Her brother is a lot like that one guy from Love and Marriage ""Bud"". The acting in these short films is suppperb. The critics that were hard on these films were just jealous that they didn't come up with this ingenius idea. I'm surprised Clarista never went on to making anything better than that Bewitched show on TGIF with all the talking cats. It was a trip, but not as revolutionary as these fine films.",1118275200,4,511,4.565217391304348
2251017,2,B0007Y08LK,"""Clarissa Explains it All"" is one of the bright spots in my memory of television past. It somehow matched the youthful innocence of ""Leave It To Beaver"" or ""The Brady Bunch"" in a contemporary form that did not seem like it could ever appear dated or a worthy object of mocking laughter, like Beaver and The Bunch are today.

Watching it again years later, the episodes stand up very well. I had great fun watching them. The only thing that really ""dates"" them are the cheesy computer graphics, but the show is still as charming and hilarious as it ever was. Ferg-breath was still really, really annoying, and it was a special treat to see Marshall rap and dance--something I'd missed the first time around on Nickelodeon.

Unfortunately, the special features caused me to crash and burn during this trip down memory lane, for me at least. The MTV Cribs feature had no place in this series, in my opinion, because Clarissa is a character that developed over 5 seasons, and she is not the same thing as Melissa Joan Hart. Watching a much older Hart prance around her mansion, showing a penchant for Hollywood excess, parties and booze (she mentions her love of gin enough times to warrant an AA meeting or two), completely ruined the charm of Clarissa's character for me. No matter how hard I try to keep them separate, I just couldn't forget that this dull Hollywood brat was the same person who once brought a brilliant, clever and genuinely interesting girl named Clarissa to life. If the woman who created Clarissa could not even retain some of her character's finer qualities, how am I as a viewer supposed to retain my appreciation for Clarissa Explains It All? Was it all just a way for Hart to purchase a mansion and party her way to oblivion? I thought Clarissa stood for something much more, and better than that.

The DVD also forces four previews on the viewer, which couldn't be more annoying. I didn't purchase advertisements; I purchased a collection of television episodes.

If you liked ""Clarissa Explains It All"", you will love this DVD, obviously. If you do buy it, beware of the cribs feature, however, if you have any interest in maintaining the legend of Clarissa in your memory. There's nothing worse than spending time with a pleasant memory of a good friend from your youth, only to have all those great feelings destroyed by the reality of who that person really was.

5 stars for the episodes. 0 stars for the DVD because of the forced previews and MTV Cribs feature.",1117929600,27,2492,4.680365296803653
2251018,5,B0007Y08LK,"It is so awesome that Nickelodeon is launching this DVD series.  I think it will be a great way to satisfy the classic Nick lovers such as myself.

This is an awesome set.  It's so great to be able to see Clarissa Explains It All again and what makes it even better is that I can watch the episodes whenever I want.  this is highly recommended for every Clarissa fan.

And for the reviewer who asked about the Nick Time Capsule, it's an awesome collection of old Nickelodeon promos that aired between the years 1991 and 1993.  There's nine of them all together on this one.  I hope there will be more Time Capsules on future releases.  I'm especially hoping if they release ""You Can't Do That On Television"" that they'll include a Time Capsule that has some promos from Nick's ""silver ball"" logo days from the early 80's.  I'd also love to see those classic mid to late 80's promos as well.

Keep 'em comin,' Nickelodeon!",1117497600,5,921,4.461077844311378
2251019,5,B0007Y08LK,"Needless to say, this was a smart show for kids back in the good days of Nickelodeon when they had more live-action shows before Nicktoons took over. All 13 original episodes are present and in great quality.

Now for the surprises. When this set first came out a few weeks ago, we all assumed that the original opening sequence was still not intact, based on a quick preview of the DVDs. But then once you watch everything more closely, you'll find that the last episode on the set (""Sick Days"") has the ORIGINAL opening intact! Nickelodeon deleted this sequence in around 1993 and replaced it with the one we all know where she repeatedly attempts to write her name on the screen. It was never seen again until now when they released the show on DVD. It might have been unintentional, but we can call this as somewhat of an ""easter egg.""

Another surprise is that Nickelodeon included a handful of their early 1990s Nick ID promo shorts (those 10 second clips they used to play before a show would start). Amazing Nickelodeon thought of that idea. With these surprises and releasing the ""Nick Rewind"" line of DVDs, there may be hope for more! Lets all get together in a circle, hold hands, bend our heads and close our eyes, and pray for future releases of Nick classics like You Can't Do That on Television, Hey Dude, Salute Your Shorts, Are You Afraid of the Dark, etc.",1117324800,22,1373,4.554655870445344
2251020,5,B0007Y08LK,"To all you young people,

I watched this show as an adult under unusual cicumstances (don't ask). It was very good for something on cable in those days. The artistic style is totally a 1980's hangover, but the show moved quickly and was funny. The proving ground for Sabrina. I believe this DVD release is an experiment to see if this will sell on word of Internet alone. If you liked the old Nickelodeon shows and want to see more, put your money where your mouse is. If they release season two, don't be surprized if there's a Roman Meal commercial from 1981. Like I wrote, I was an Adult at the time.",1117238400,,603,4.336283185840708
