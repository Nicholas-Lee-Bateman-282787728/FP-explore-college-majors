I only hope the DVD set has the 200th episode, as it is not the ""Normal"" type of episode and is never showed in syndication.",1200528000,2,279,4.090909090909091

3087681,4,B0012EM5EC,"Many fine episodes in this season - especially concluding the Robin Colcord saga and giving Sam a true adversary with John Allen Hill.

3087753,5,B0012EM5EC,"Even though my husband and I have seen Cheers years and years ago, we are enjoying binging on it.  It's sort of timeless except for the styles of clothing and vehicles.  They are all great actors and many of them are still acting in prominent TV series.",1453507200,,253,4.361702127659575
3087754,5,B0012EM5EC,One of the best seasons of the show,1453507200,,35,3.5

3087760,4,B0012EM5EC,"Anything less than 5 stars for the series would be a travesty, but the picture quality on Instant View on a 24"" TV is nothing to write home about.  Is there a 'fix' for that?",1444435200,,174,3.9714285714285715
3087761,4,B0012EM5EC,This whole series is excellent as far as I am concerned.  A very good comedy with excellent actors as well as writers.  You can't beat that combination.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who is seeking a diversion from the trials an tribulations of everyday life.,1444176000,,268,4.659574468085107

3087778,5,B0012EM5EC,"What can I say?  It's CHEERS.  Still good for a laugh after all these years.  An episode or two at bedtime and you can sink into your pillow and imagine yourself sitting at that bar making inane small talk with Norm and Cliffy.
OK...what's with the shoulder pads and Rebecca.  A truly unattractive style.",1440201600,,304,4.574074074074074
3087779,5,B0012EM5EC,"I'm not a big fan of the Carla character for some reason, I just find her annoying for some reason, but that character aside there is nothing that I don't love about this series--and it's so rare for a show to keep its quality going for 11 seasons. I'm a little miffed that Amazon Prime Video won't show me seasons 10 and 11 for free, but I think that may have more to do with the series' ownership than Amazon. Maybe eventually I'll guy the entire series on dvd. But whatever, this is a great series, great acting (even the Carla character), and I kind of like the cast that they ended up with by this season.

Everybody knows your name...",1438992000,,640,4.289256198347108

3087785,5,B0012EM5EC,Quick ship! As described!,1412035200,,25,5.5
3087796,5,B0012EM5EC,"""Cheers"" had an unsuccessful first season, but the sitcom was not cancelled, and it gradually gained an audience and became a fixture on NBC's Thursday night schedule.  By its ninth season, it was the top-rated show in America, and this DVD set contains all 27 episodes of that season that were originally aired from September 1990 to May 1991.

Ted Danson stars as Sam Malone, an ex-baseball player who owns and bartends at Cheers.  The great characters that comprise the bar's employees and regular clientele come from different social classes and walks of life, but form a community of sorts.

The cast gets into all sorts of funny situations during the course of these episodes--a recurring theme this season is the conflict between Sam and the owner of the restaurant upstairs from the bar.  Singer Bobby Hatfield and Boston Celtic great Kevin McHale each guest star in an episode, and Arsenio Hall and Michael Dukakis make cameo appearances.  At the end of the season, Sam expresses a desire to become a father.

""Cheers"" reached the 200-episode mark during Season Nine, and John McLaughlin hosted a retrospective with the main characters that discussed how the show emerged in spite of its inauspicious beginning, showed highlights of episodes in seasons past, and talked about the relationships between the characters.

Gen Xers will also recall some of the cool fashions that were ""in"" during the early Nineties while watching these episodes.  Some episodes touch on adult themes that would not be appropriate for younger viewers, but for those of age these episodes will remind viewers that ""Cheers"" is one of the best sitcoms of all time with its well-above-average number of laugh-out-loud moments and exceptionally witty writing.",1409616000,,1742,5.105633802816901
3087797,5,B0012EM5EC,"My client wanted to see this episode so badly, and I was happy I could find it on here.
We watched it and we both enjoyed it immensely.",1408320000,,135,3.857142857142857
3087798,5,B0012EM5EC,Finished season 9 but when I went to season 10 I noticed that it was no longer free for Prime members.  Looking back at season 9 I found that it too was no longer available for free.  First you raise the Prime rate and then you reduce the service.  I had to revert to Netflix to continue watching Cheers.,1408233600,,304,4.11864406779661
3087799,5,B0012EM5EC,We love Cheers. Great cast and writing. It is great to be able to binge watch it.,1407369600,,81,3.823529411764706

3087803,3,B0012EM5EC,"Good because I love Cheers.  Not so good because I never liked the character Rebecca.  Still missing Diane.
The rest of the cast still great.",1403395200,,141,4.6
3087804,2,B0012EM5EC,"No matter how I try, about 50% of the time the sub-titles do not sync with the voices.  Sometimes the sync is off 10-15 seconds.  Other times it is only off a few seconds.  But, it is very annoying.

I have tried everything I can think of to re-sync the subtitles:

1.  Stopping the episode and restarting from the beginning.
2.  Not selecting fast-forward during the ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"" ditty near the beginning of the episode,
3.  Re-selecting set-up options for subtitles.
4.  Exiting Amazon Prime, going to Netflix, then coming back to Amazon Prime at another time.

Quite frustrating, since I rely on the sub-titles to understand some of the dialogue.

Were it not for the sub-title problem, I would give Cheers ""5 Stars.""

3087818,5,B0012EM5EC,"The content of the programming was superior as always for this series.  But, I was very disappointed with the outer packaging. My Seasons 1-8 are each packaged in colorful cardboard covers. This particular edition was only in a plastic dust case. I suspect that this version was separated from a complete sold as package set and was sold as a single.",1394755200,,350,4.737704918032787
3087819,4,B0012EM5EC,"The cast is still motoring along. This is still a funny show, not as funny as the first 6 or 7 seasons but still up there. The early seasons, almost everything took place within the confines of the bar. The later seasons, you will see the cast venture out into other locations. But you still have some hilarious moments. I still love to watch these episodes, even if they are 15 years old. Outstanding cast(with the exception of Kirstie, whom I never cared for), it is still worth your time. Enjoy!",1393372800,,498,4.483516483516484
3087820,5,B0012EM5EC,I love watching Cheers. The humor in it is so funny. I hate Carl's Character though. But she is acting the part and really does a good job with it. I never watched it when it was on TV but I sure watch it now.  I keep it in my favorites and can watch them over and over after a little time goes on.,1391817600,,298,3.65625
3087821,4,B0012EM5EC,I enjoy all the regular characters in this series.. Pure fun!  If they all had Shelly Long (Diane Chambers) I would give the show five stars!  Not quite as enjoyable for me after she left the show,1390089600,,196,4.27027027027027
3087822,5,B0012EM5EC,I gave this 5 stars because these episodes never get old.  I have watched every season and episode in order.  Season 9 is one of the better seasons getting to know Frazier and Lilith.,1389484800,,183,4.352941176470588

3087837,5,B0012EM5EC,"This still remains a great adult comedy, but, also deals w/ people's true feelings on life. One show that NEVER gets old & w/ Kirstie Alley was the perfect match, for ""God's Gift to Babes"", Sam Malone.",1379721600,,201,4.45945945945946

3087839,5,B0012EM5EC,"I enjoyed it years ago when it first came out and love the chance to see it again, without advertising.

Comes to find out that not only is some of the content edited but the packaging has changed from the box set look to a skinny plastic casing for all 3 of the final seasons. The content editing is certainly dissapointing but now where a full season should sit on the shelf 8 seasons flow then 3 crummy cheap looking seasons at the end. I'm a huge fan and won't be returning but am admittedly frustrated with the change in look.,1371081600,,524,4.303030303030303

3087860,5,B0012EM5EC,"I love cheers. I watched it since it first came out when I was 11. It was the first show I found and watched on my own. Most times I just watched what everyone else watched. So I would buy this set no matter what. I do not like the fact that episodes are edited, and there are times when I can tell. My memories are not perfect but I always know when something is missing/changed. But, I was worried they were not going to release any more seasons, so I am glad just to have it. As for the packaging I actually like it. One reason is that it's easier to keep safe without looking frayed or dirty. Second, it takes up less space. Though I wish they would have started this way. I always hate having series in two different type packages. I really do think they needed to add more special features though. This show is too classic to not have cast interviews or whatever. However, I will say when they change the cases like this they should offer retro-fitted cases for previous seasons (at a low cost). I remember when they changed the cases for the Simpsons they gave you a number you could call in order to get a normal case (to match previous seasons) of course it was Homer's voice, and he gave you the link and derided you for your choice for of a plain case lol, but at least they gave you the option. Anyway, I would recommend Cheers to anyone, as for people who say that Cheers was losing it's luster, I'd like to add that even cheers' worst episode was and is better than most other shows best episode. The writing and acting/chemistry was top notch. Something you rarely find on tv. Especially now in the day of reality TV. do you think Kim Kardashian could make it in a world where you'd actually have to do work and say things that are actually clever? Oh well, you're sure to love this series no matter if you grew up with it like I did or just discovering it.",1339200000,,1872,4.231843575418995

3087862,4,B0012EM5EC,I am in love with having Cheers on DVD.  I love the show and its cast of characters.

3087884,5,B0012EM5EC,"""Cheers"" is my favorite television show of all time and one of the all-time best shows, but the show was starting to get stale by the ninth season.  Still, a lesser season of Cheers is a great season.

Sam is back in charge of Cheers in this season and things feel normal after a few seasons of corporate ownership.  It also featured the 200th show (hosted by John McLaughlin) and such classic sub-plots as Frasier reading Dickens to the Cheers gang and the short-term bartender Earl.  As far as characters, the ninth season saw the introduction of Henri and John Allen Hill and the increased prominence of Paul Krapence (the same actor had a different name in earlier seasons).  It also saw the (temporary) end of Robin Colcord as a featured character.

(One other note: Although many have complained about the new packaging, I prefer the slick and compact packaging of all give discs in one normal-sized DVD case to the large and bulky packaging of the previous seasons.)

Cheers was beginning to lose its luster, partly because Sam and Rebecca's relationship had ""matured"" to the point where they were true friends, but it still remained a fantastic show with a special cast.  Although the overall quality of the show had begun to decline by this season, there are too many great jokes, episodes, and characters to give it any less than five stars.",1222128000,2,1351,4.743589743589744
3087885,5,B0012EM5EC,"I agree with those who are upset with the changes in this series, and apparently to Season 10. However - this may not be all Paramounts fault. Not that long ago, the wonderful folks at RIAA and various record companies sued people who used ""Samples"" of their music - usually 10 - 15 second snippets that wound up on songs by Chemical Brothers and other sampler groups - but also on TV shows.

Essentially, our legal system decided that this was ""copyright infringement"" and ordered that anybody who continues to use or release these snippets pay royalties. Yes - it's probably the same people who do not want to let us make copies of our CD's or DVD's for protection because ""they are very resiliant"" - right.

Anyhow, my point is that as a result of this ruling, it may have become cost prohibitive to obtain the rights to use these snippets, and may also explain to long delay between season 8 and season 9 coming out. Sure, Paramount might have been able to get the rights - but at what cost? Longer waits, higher prices; or possibly just the decision not to release the final 3 seasons.

So, we are stuck suffering because of the record execs, but there are still some good laughs to be had from the season, even if it has been butchered.",1220486400,3,1242,4.462555066079295
3087886,1,B0012EM5EC,"Like most everybody else, the packaging was an issue at first, but frankly the new packaging takes up a lot less space on an already crowded shelf, so no problem. My gripe (and it is a BIG one) is the fact that these episodes were edited from the originals. Don't believe me? Look on the back of the case in the little rectangular box at the bottom and it says so right there. Had I known this, I would never have ordered it, as much as I love this show. What the idiots at CBS Video apparently don't understand is that the whole point of buying complete seasons is that so we can see the complete episodes as they were intended to be seen, not some hacked up versions by some no-talent hack who has nothing to do with the show in the first place. I feel like they should redo this season on dvd and give everybody who bought these hacked up versions a copy for free.

I also didn't like the changes made to the episodes. But I love this show and my relief that it appears the final three seasons will finally come out outways the negatives. The changes and the packaging don't keep me from laughing out loud while watching this show. I also accept that there will probably be a complete 11 season set that will be a heck of a lot cheaper than the combined original sets. It might just have all those features everybody is so upset are not included in these DVD's. If that doesn't happen, oh well. I still will enjoy this series for what it is and be grateful CBS even bothered to release these last few seasons after the first 8 sold so poorly.",1212883200,4,839,4.3164556962025316

I suppose it's a case of remembering the magic, and being able to see re-runs rather readily.  However, I would like to propose a DVD set to the fine folks at Paramount that I would buy in a heartbeat.  How about packaging all the opening teasers for each episode and titling it ""Cheers Shots"".  As each bit was a stand alone that had nothing to do with the plot of a given episode, this would be a collection of comedy moments unlike any other.

My beef with this Region 1 DVD is this. After waiting for a couple of years now, for the the 9th season to come out, I was extremly angry to see how this disc looked. After 8 seasons of Cheers stuck in the same ""digi packs"", cardboard sleeves with a fold out housing inside, the parent company has changed the format! All the discs (5 in total this time) are stuck inside a single disc DVD case just like the ones from Bossom Buddies and Family Ties. So now you'll have the complete Frasier looking uniform and nice next to Cheers, the mixed up series. Which may or may not annoy you enough, like having a piece of sand in your eye, so when they re-release the whole series on, lets say Blu-Ray, you feel compelled to get it all again. Maybe.

Just a warning. The rest is fine.",1211500800,2,1051,4.276381909547739

It doesn't have the same wit as the seasons before, and the way of humour has changed a little bit. Some minor characters from the bar have disappeared gradually: the one with the beard and the characteristic voice, or the wanna-be-lawyer, I can't remember his name, are missing. But still there is nothing like Cheers on today's television. They show it here from time to time, but always at about 2 or 3 p.m. in the morning. So the DVDs are a must-have for me. Please, release seasons 10 and 11 quickly!",1211155200,2,725,4.41044776119403

While shows that have not been heard of in ten years and have had no real air time - they release their seasons back to back every 4-6 weeks, while we wait years for a show that won 6 Golden Globes; 65 other wins; and 138 nominations.  There are a couple of down sides to this Season, and one of them is the music that others have mentioned - especially the ""I Fought the Law"" scene - I had to rewind it a few times to try to hear what song it way - - still have no clue - and it makes no sense.  I did also catch the swearing as well.  Otherwise, I am happy to have it - it has been too long.  The case it came in is awesome - although it does not match my other ones, it's all good -  most show seasons do not match anymore due to them changing the cases.

It came out at a time when ""charm and wit"" as well as good writing and only subtle sexual humor was tossed into TV shows.
(Unlike the majority of modern TV shows which are like one trick ponies simply relying on one crude sex joke after another with no real creativity).

We of course have been buying ALL the Cheers episodes on DVD because this is a show we would rather watch 100 times over on a rainy night as opposed to 98% of the stuff on TV today.

HOWEVER........ having said that.
Magic never lasts forever.
Even for CHEERS.

Season 9 was the season where one could really detect a major difference in the writing and the feel of the show.
The old charm of Cheers seems to be fading away and replaced with pretty silly and ""over the top"" story lines that don't have the same feeling.

We of course will also buy Season 10-11 when they come out (hopefully)........ but like all things in life........ there comes a time when things begin to fade and eventually die.

In the case of Cheers, season 9 was such. Once Sam scored with Rebeca the show had nowhere to go (just like it happened to Cybill Sheperd and Bruce Willis in MOONLIGHTING).
Perhaps the sole exception to this rule was TAXI which sadly was canceled after only five season. Other greats like SEINFELD and EVERYBODY LOST REAYMOND both lost most of their magic by their last two seasons (8 and 9 in both cases).

Since it has been several years since I have seen these shows, I won't be able to determine what has been changed, but I felt compelled to alert potential buyers that the music royalty hounds have savaged another classic show. These monopolistic behemoths must be stopped.

You never see anything close to this on television anymore and its a shame too because not everything is a superficial reality show with backstabbers smiling to your face like at some church function. Shows like Cheers really gave that Survivor, American Idol element (i.e. Gary's Olde Town Tavern crowd) a pie in the face and we need more of that manliness and machismo back rather than ""real"" foppish pretty boys, ""hardcore"" poseurs acting cute to get what they think is some easy action with married or taken women.",1208476800,3,826,4.664383561643835

3087941,5,B0012EM5EC,"It's been awhile since Paramount released season eight of Cheers, and I'd even heard that due to poor sales on previous seasons that Paramount would not be releasing any more seasons. Thus I was very happy to see season nine come up for preorder, since it really is essential. It's not that seasons ten and eleven are not essential, but you are really left hanging if you only have Cheers up through season eight. There are SPOILERS AHEAD, primarily from season eight.

At the conclusion of season eight, Rebecca's boyfriend, billionaire Robin Colcord, had been stealing information from the company for which Rebecca worked. Robin cleverly silenced Rebecca by promising to marry her. Sam, fearing Rebecca would wind up being implicated in Robin's criminal schemes, went to Rebecca's company and uncovered the plot himself. Robin responded by wiring his money to Switzerland and fleeing the country. The good news is that Sam was rewarded by the company by having his bar returned to his ownership. Likewise, Rebecca was fired, not because of Robin's insider trading but because ""they never much cared for her work"", to quote Woody. Rebecca turns to Sam for comfort which turns into a passionate encounter when a penitent Robin suddenly returns, seeking the love and forgiveness of Rebecca and finds...
Thus begins season nine.

Season nine deals with what exactly it is that Robin saw when season eight ended, how Robin deals with incarceration, how Sam and Rebecca deal with the new standing of their personal and professional relationship, and how Rebecca reacts to the idea of marrying a now bankrupt Robin when he is paroled at midseason. To top it all off, Sam is beginning to really enjoy babysitting Frasier and Lillith's son to the point of making a pest of himself. Sam decides that a child is something he would really like to have in his life, and with the prompting of Elvis' ghost decides on a likely candidate for a mother in the season finale.

Although still funny, the earlier seasons of Cheers haven't aged that well. However, season nine is recent enough (1990-1991) that it should still hold up. It's not necessary to have seen the first five seasons (1982-1987) to enjoy season nine, since ""The Diane Chambers Years"" are practically a different show from the last six seasons, but you should have seen seasons six through eight to appreciate what is going on in season nine.",1200614400,11,2396,4.911111111111111

I'm a little miffed that Amazon Prime Video won't show me seasons 10 and 11 for free, but I think that may have more to do with the series' ownership than Amazon. Maybe eventually I'll guy the entire series on dvd. But whatever, this is a great series, great acting (even the Carla character), and I kind of like the cast that they ended up with by this season.

3322293,5,B0012EM5EC,"""Cheers"" had an unsuccessful first season, but the sitcom was not cancelled, and it gradually gained an audience and became a fixture on NBC's Thursday night schedule.  By its ninth season, it was the top-rated show in America, and this DVD set contains all 27 episodes of that season that were originally aired from September 1990 to May 1991.

Ted Danson stars as Sam Malone, an ex-baseball player who owns and bartends at Cheers.  The great characters that comprise the bar's employees and regular clientele come from different social classes and walks of life, but form a community of sorts.

The cast gets into all sorts of funny situations during the course of these episodes--a recurring theme this season is the conflict between Sam and the owner of the restaurant upstairs from the bar.  Singer Bobby Hatfield and Boston Celtic great Kevin McHale each guest star in an episode, and Arsenio Hall and Michael Dukakis make cameo appearances.  At the end of the season, Sam expresses a desire to become a father.

""Cheers"" reached the 200-episode mark during Season Nine, and John McLaughlin hosted a retrospective with the main characters that discussed how the show emerged in spite of its inauspicious beginning, showed highlights of episodes in seasons past, and talked about the relationships between the characters.

Gen Xers will also recall some of the cool fashions that were ""in"" during the early Nineties while watching these episodes.  Some episodes touch on adult themes that would not be appropriate for younger viewers, but for those of age these episodes will remind viewers that ""Cheers"" is one of the best sitcoms of all time with its well-above-average number of laugh-out-loud moments and exceptionally witty writing.",1409616000,,1742,5.105633802816901

3322295,5,B0012EM5EC,Finished season 9 but when I went to season 10 I noticed that it was no longer free for Prime members.  Looking back at season 9 I found that it too was no longer available for free.  First you raise the Prime rate and then you reduce the service.

The rest of the cast still great.",1403395200,,141,4.6
3322301,2,B0012EM5EC,"No matter how I try, about 50% of the time the sub-titles do not sync with the voices.  Sometimes the sync is off 10-15 seconds.  Other times it is only off a few seconds.  But, it is very annoying.

I have tried everything I can think of to re-sync the subtitles:

1.  Stopping the episode and restarting from the beginning.
2.  Not selecting fast-forward during the ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"" ditty near the beginning of the episode,
3.  Re-selecting set-up options for subtitles.
4.  Exiting Amazon Prime, going to Netflix, then coming back to Amazon Prime at another time.

Quite frustrating, since I rely on the sub-titles to understand some of the dialogue.

Were it not for the sub-title problem, I would give Cheers ""5 Stars.""

Comes to find out that not only is some of the content edited but the packaging has changed from the box set look to a skinny plastic casing for all 3 of the final seasons. The content editing is certainly dissapointing but now where a full season should sit on the shelf 8 seasons flow then 3 crummy cheap looking seasons at the end. I'm a huge fan and won't be returning but am admittedly frustrated with the change in look.,1371081600,,524,4.303030303030303

3322357,5,B0012EM5EC,"I love cheers. I watched it since it first came out when I was 11. It was the first show I found and watched on my own. Most times I just watched what everyone else watched. So I would buy this set no matter what. I do not like the fact that episodes are edited, and there are times when I can tell. My memories are not perfect but I always know when something is missing/changed. But, I was worried they were not going to release any more seasons, so I am glad just to have it. As for the packaging I actually like it. One reason is that it's easier to keep safe without looking frayed or dirty. Second, it takes up less space. Though I wish they would have started this way. I always hate having series in two different type packages. I really do think they needed to add more special features though. This show is too classic to not have cast interviews or whatever. However, I will say when they change the cases like this they should offer retro-fitted cases for previous seasons (at a low cost). I remember when they changed the cases for the Simpsons they gave you a number you could call in order to get a normal case (to match previous seasons) of course it was Homer's voice, and he gave you the link and derided you for your choice for of a plain case lol, but at least they gave you the option. Anyway, I would recommend Cheers to anyone, as for people who say that Cheers was losing it's luster, I'd like to add that even cheers' worst episode was and is better than most other shows best episode. The writing and acting/chemistry was top notch. Something you rarely find on tv. Especially now in the day of reality TV. do you think Kim Kardashian could make it in a world where you'd actually have to do work and say things that are actually clever? Oh well, you're sure to love this series no matter if you grew up with it like I did or just discovering it.",1339200000,,1872,4.231843575418995

3322359,4,B0012EM5EC,I am in love with having Cheers on DVD.  I love the show and its cast of characters.

3322381,5,B0012EM5EC,"""Cheers"" is my favorite television show of all time and one of the all-time best shows, but the show was starting to get stale by the ninth season.  Still, a lesser season of Cheers is a great season.

Sam is back in charge of Cheers in this season and things feel normal after a few seasons of corporate ownership.  It also featured the 200th show (hosted by John McLaughlin) and such classic sub-plots as Frasier reading Dickens to the Cheers gang and the short-term bartender Earl.  As far as characters, the ninth season saw the introduction of Henri and John Allen Hill and the increased prominence of Paul Krapence (the same actor had a different name in earlier seasons).  It also saw the (temporary) end of Robin Colcord as a featured character.

(One other note: Although many have complained about the new packaging, I prefer the slick and compact packaging of all give discs in one normal-sized DVD case to the large and bulky packaging of the previous seasons.)

Cheers was beginning to lose its luster, partly because Sam and Rebecca's relationship had ""matured"" to the point where they were true friends, but it still remained a fantastic show with a special cast.  Although the overall quality of the show had begun to decline by this season, there are too many great jokes, episodes, and characters to give it any less than five stars.",1222128000,2,1351,4.743589743589744
3322382,5,B0012EM5EC,"I agree with those who are upset with the changes in this series, and apparently to Season 10. However - this may not be all Paramounts fault. Not that long ago, the wonderful folks at RIAA and various record companies sued people who used ""Samples"" of their music - usually 10 - 15 second snippets that wound up on songs by Chemical Brothers and other sampler groups - but also on TV shows.

Essentially, our legal system decided that this was ""copyright infringement"" and ordered that anybody who continues to use or release these snippets pay royalties. Yes - it's probably the same people who do not want to let us make copies of our CD's or DVD's for protection because ""they are very resiliant"" - right.

Anyhow, my point is that as a result of this ruling, it may have become cost prohibitive to obtain the rights to use these snippets, and may also explain to long delay between season 8 and season 9 coming out. Sure, Paramount might have been able to get the rights - but at what cost? Longer waits, higher prices; or possibly just the decision not to release the final 3 seasons.

So, we are stuck suffering because of the record execs, but there are still some good laughs to be had from the season, even if it has been butchered.",1220486400,3,1242,4.462555066079295
3322383,1,B0012EM5EC,"Like most everybody else, the packaging was an issue at first, but frankly the new packaging takes up a lot less space on an already crowded shelf, so no problem. My gripe (and it is a BIG one) is the fact that these episodes were edited from the originals. Don't believe me? Look on the back of the case in the little rectangular box at the bottom and it says so right there. Had I known this, I would never have ordered it, as much as I love this show. What the idiots at CBS Video apparently don't understand is that the whole point of buying complete seasons is that so we can see the complete episodes as they were intended to be seen, not some hacked up versions by some no-talent hack who has nothing to do with the show in the first place. I feel like they should redo this season on dvd and give everybody who bought these hacked up versions a copy for free.

I also didn't like the changes made to the episodes. But I love this show and my relief that it appears the final three seasons will finally come out outways the negatives. The changes and the packaging don't keep me from laughing out loud while watching this show. I also accept that there will probably be a complete 11 season set that will be a heck of a lot cheaper than the combined original sets. It might just have all those features everybody is so upset are not included in these DVD's. If that doesn't happen, oh well. I still will enjoy this series for what it is and be grateful CBS even bothered to release these last few seasons after the first 8 sold so poorly.",1212883200,4,839,4.3164556962025316

I suppose it's a case of remembering the magic, and being able to see re-runs rather readily.  However, I would like to propose a DVD set to the fine folks at Paramount that I would buy in a heartbeat.  How about packaging all the opening teasers for each episode and titling it ""Cheers Shots"".  As each bit was a stand alone that had nothing to do with the plot of a given episode, this would be a collection of comedy moments unlike any other.

My beef with this Region 1 DVD is this. After waiting for a couple of years now, for the the 9th season to come out, I was extremly angry to see how this disc looked. After 8 seasons of Cheers stuck in the same ""digi packs"", cardboard sleeves with a fold out housing inside, the parent company has changed the format! All the discs (5 in total this time) are stuck inside a single disc DVD case just like the ones from Bossom Buddies and Family Ties. So now you'll have the complete Frasier looking uniform and nice next to Cheers, the mixed up series. Which may or may not annoy you enough, like having a piece of sand in your eye, so when they re-release the whole series on, lets say Blu-Ray, you feel compelled to get it all again. Maybe.

Just a warning. The rest is fine.",1211500800,2,1051,4.276381909547739

It doesn't have the same wit as the seasons before, and the way of humour has changed a little bit. Some minor characters from the bar have disappeared gradually: the one with the beard and the characteristic voice, or the wanna-be-lawyer, I can't remember his name, are missing. But still there is nothing like Cheers on today's television. They show it here from time to time, but always at about 2 or 3 p.m. in the morning. So the DVDs are a must-have for me.

While shows that have not been heard of in ten years and have had no real air time - they release their seasons back to back every 4-6 weeks, while we wait years for a show that won 6 Golden Globes; 65 other wins; and 138 nominations.  There are a couple of down sides to this Season, and one of them is the music that others have mentioned - especially the ""I Fought the Law"" scene - I had to rewind it a few times to try to hear what song it way - - still have no clue - and it makes no sense.  I did also catch the swearing as well.  Otherwise, I am happy to have it - it has been too long.  The case it came in is awesome - although it does not match my other ones, it's all good -  most show seasons do not match anymore due to them changing the cases.

It came out at a time when ""charm and wit"" as well as good writing and only subtle sexual humor was tossed into TV shows.
(Unlike the majority of modern TV shows which are like one trick ponies simply relying on one crude sex joke after another with no real creativity).

We of course have been buying ALL the Cheers episodes on DVD because this is a show we would rather watch 100 times over on a rainy night as opposed to 98% of the stuff on TV today.

HOWEVER........ having said that.
Magic never lasts forever.
Even for CHEERS.

Season 9 was the season where one could really detect a major difference in the writing and the feel of the show.
The old charm of Cheers seems to be fading away and replaced with pretty silly and ""over the top"" story lines that don't have the same feeling.

We of course will also buy Season 10-11 when they come out (hopefully)........ but like all things in life........ there comes a time when things begin to fade and eventually die.

In the case of Cheers, season 9 was such. Once Sam scored with Rebeca the show had nowhere to go (just like it happened to Cybill Sheperd and Bruce Willis in MOONLIGHTING).
Perhaps the sole exception to this rule was TAXI which sadly was canceled after only five season. Other greats like SEINFELD and EVERYBODY LOST REAYMOND both lost most of their magic by their last two seasons (8 and 9 in both cases).

Since it has been several years since I have seen these shows, I won't be able to determine what has been changed, but I felt compelled to alert potential buyers that the music royalty hounds have savaged another classic show. These monopolistic behemoths must be stopped.

You never see anything close to this on television anymore and its a shame too because not everything is a superficial reality show with backstabbers smiling to your face like at some church function. Shows like Cheers really gave that Survivor, American Idol element (i.e. Gary's Olde Town Tavern crowd) a pie in the face and we need more of that manliness and machismo back rather than ""real"" foppish pretty boys, ""hardcore"" poseurs acting cute to get what they think is some easy action with married or taken women.",1208476800,3,826,4.664383561643835

3322438,5,B0012EM5EC,"It's been awhile since Paramount released season eight of Cheers, and I'd even heard that due to poor sales on previous seasons that Paramount would not be releasing any more seasons. Thus I was very happy to see season nine come up for preorder, since it really is essential. It's not that seasons ten and eleven are not essential, but you are really left hanging if you only have Cheers up through season eight. There are SPOILERS AHEAD, primarily from season eight.

At the conclusion of season eight, Rebecca's boyfriend, billionaire Robin Colcord, had been stealing information from the company for which Rebecca worked. Robin cleverly silenced Rebecca by promising to marry her. Sam, fearing Rebecca would wind up being implicated in Robin's criminal schemes, went to Rebecca's company and uncovered the plot himself. Robin responded by wiring his money to Switzerland and fleeing the country. The good news is that Sam was rewarded by the company by having his bar returned to his ownership. Likewise, Rebecca was fired, not because of Robin's insider trading but because ""they never much cared for her work"", to quote Woody. Rebecca turns to Sam for comfort which turns into a passionate encounter when a penitent Robin suddenly returns, seeking the love and forgiveness of Rebecca and finds...
Thus begins season nine.

Season nine deals with what exactly it is that Robin saw when season eight ended, how Robin deals with incarceration, how Sam and Rebecca deal with the new standing of their personal and professional relationship, and how Rebecca reacts to the idea of marrying a now bankrupt Robin when he is paroled at midseason. To top it all off, Sam is beginning to really enjoy babysitting Frasier and Lillith's son to the point of making a pest of himself. Sam decides that a child is something he would really like to have in his life, and with the prompting of Elvis' ghost decides on a likely candidate for a mother in the season finale.

Although still funny, the earlier seasons of Cheers haven't aged that well. However, season nine is recent enough (1990-1991) that it should still hold up. It's not necessary to have seen the first five seasons (1982-1987) to enjoy season nine, since ""The Diane Chambers Years"" are practically a different show from the last six seasons, but you should have seen seasons six through eight to appreciate what is going on in season nine.",1200614400,11,2396,4.911111111111111

8245596,3,B0012EM5EC,"The music replacements ruined some of the episodes.  In ""Grease"", ""I Fought the Law"" was removed.  The song lyrics were basically the punchline of running gag.  The replacement song doesn't even remotely relate to the situation.  Robin Colcord was on a prison detail outside of Cheers and Sam was teasing Rebecca about it and Rebecca got same back the same way.  Without ""I Fought the Law"", the gag isn't there.

CBS needs to stop just arbitrarily replacing songs.  They need to get on the phone, work out a deal with the current rights holders to the music in question and put the music originally used in the episodes back where they belong.",1505520000,,643,4.6875
8245597,5,B0012EM5EC,Season 9 is a very good one. I like all of the characters and the jokes. Towards the end of season 9 Cliff and Norm seem to have fewer lines and Fraser and Lilith have more. Sam is slowing down with trying to pick up chicks and Carla has grown as a person. I would love to watch the last two seasons but I will have to wait for that until a later date.,1490054400,,352,3.77027027027027
8245598,5,B0012EM5EC,My wife and I are still enjoying Cheers. We are well into the 9th season on Amazon Prime. The two part special for their 200th episode was very entertaining. The writing is slipping a bit but the acting is great.,1486166400,,212,4.325
