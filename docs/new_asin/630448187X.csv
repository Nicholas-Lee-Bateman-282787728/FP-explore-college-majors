887551,4,630448187X,"A ship that was supposed to transport some crates from South America to a museum seems to have a crew that lost their heads. The crates finally get flown in. One full of goodies the other just leaves. The museum's Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) is suspicious. Everyone else is happy until a guard seems to have misplaced his hypothalamus. Looks like Dr. Margo Green is about to be consumed by her work.

This is a pretty spiffy well done formula movie. As with many contemporary movies they completely ignore the book and add all the standard clichs. We have the ruthless rivalry, missing scientists, and mysterious crates. Naturally no one does what they are supposed to do and you start rooting for the, lets just call it a, relic.",1507248000,2,740,4.648854961832061

887671,4,630448187X,"BOTTOM LINE: Is this film perfect? Nope. Is it a faithful word-for-word adaption of the novel? Not even close. Is it an entertaining, turn down the lights & jump at stuff that leaps out at you popcorn flick? Absolutely. Fans of the Preston & Child novel loathe the many changes but for mainstream monster movie fans this ones bloody good. 4 STARS

THE STORY: Researcher from Chicago Museum of Natural History ships back a strange cargo from the deep Amazon jungle whose contents provide more questions than answers. A cute, quirky museum scientist & a hard-nosed Windy City homicide cop must quickly piece together the cryptic clues... before they're ripped to pieces, along with the rest of the museum staff and half the ChiTown PD.

THOUGHTS: Ive loved this movie ever since catching it in a snow-covered theater back in January of 1997. I knew nothing of the source material, only the films two stars: Tom Sizemore & Penelope Ann Miller. (Plus, I have a big soft spot for James Whitmore, ever since I first saw THEM! decades ago.) I enjoyed THE RELIC tremendously and Ive watched it numerous times over the years. Fans of the novel have by & large torn this movie a new one, due to the many changes. I didn't get around to actually reading the novel until almost 20 years later, after already having seen & enjoyed the film several times. It is indeed very different from the movie. However, if you divorce the film from the book youll be OK. Otherwise, you walk in with a massive chip on your shoulder and will probably just hate the movie to death. I think the film, for what it is, is a lot of silly, scary, rollercoaster ride-styled fun. Sure there are plot holes, gaps in logic and whatnot, but 99% of all horror films, by necessity, have these shortcomings. Movie viewers must maintain the ability to suspend disbelief and go with whatever preposterous flubdubbery the writers & directors are throwing at us. In the real world, these kinds of situations would almost certainly never be solved as quickly & efficiently as they are in the movies and on TV. In fact, these fantastical events obviously don't happen in the real world at all, so you have to take things at face value. Sure, this movie could've been better, but even as it is I think it's got a lot of great things going for it. And speaking of that legendary creature F/X wizard Stan Winston gives us one of the coolest, most original movie monsters in decades. The Kathoga alone makes this film a keeper for me. The practical stuff looks amazing, and while the CGI isn't as polished as todays digital product his lethal Kathoga creation is nonetheless one of moviedoms slickest killer creatures.  Plus I really enjoy the performances of all the actors in the cast, from the main stars right down to the bit players.

THE BLU-RAY: A pretty pedestrian hi-def release from Lionsgate, who licensed the film from Paramount. The improvements in both audio & video, compared to the tepid DVD version of THE RELIC, more than make it worth the double dip. But be aware that theres no new bonus material, just the on-camera interview with director Peter Hyams & his full-length audio commentary, both ported over from the standard-def release. Still, if youve never seen the film, this is the best looking format of it so far and, short of a frame-by-frame restoration, this is likely as good as well get for this enjoyable creature feature.",1495324800,6,3403,4.695142378559464

887673,3,630448187X,"This movie is great if you don't take it too seriously. It's an early nineties creature feature with outdated technology and bad cgi. Taken for what it is, it's entertaining and the acting isn't too bad. If you've read the book, just lower your expectations. There's no Pendergast, no Smithback, no Moriarty. Some movie characters act contrary to their book characters. They incorrectly call the beast Kothoga instead of Mbwun. Kothoga was the tribe.

887763,3,630448187X,"In the long history of converting novels to movies, this has to be one of the worst.  Most of the time the conversion rate is about 50%.  At least half of the book makes it to the movie.  In this case, about 10% of the book makes it to the movie, and that's a really bad thing.

Why?

The film makers took an excellent book that started an entire series of books (that's still going today) and butchered it to make a short term profit.  This isn't a case of a bad translation to film.  This is a case of removing nearly every last detail except a basic premise.

What didn't make the movie that was so important?

1. The main character.  I'm not kidding.  They cut the main character.  This is the first Pendergast novel and they cut Pendergast. What were you guys smoking?

2. Moved to Chicago.  Doesn't sound like a big deal until you realize that nearly all the future books are based out of NY and the second one takes place entirely in NYC.  Now I know why they did this.  At the time the Museum of Natural History in NYC was afraid the movie would scare kids away from the Museum.  At least that's what they said.  (yeah right.  A parent dumb enough to bring their kid to an R rated horror movie, is unlikely to bring their kid to the Museum of Natural History.)

3. The ending is totally reworked and leaves you disappointed.  How do we kill this thing without the main character?  I know!  Let's just burn everything!  Great idea!

4. Let's add a lot of fluff...because no one liked the book, right?  Ugh. So much detail was removed and replaced with fluff.

Now to be fair, you can watch this movie and be entertained, if you turn your brain off.  If you consider this a popcorn movie, you might enjoy it.  If you have read this book in the last ten years, DO NOT watch this movie.  Only watch it if you've forgotten every last detail.

In the end a fantastic book was converted into a marginal movie that has little to do with the book.  If you are a horror fan, go for it.  If not, you might want to skip this one.",1487289600,,2025,4.203655352480418

OK, this movie is based on the bestselling novel Relic by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, but it does not follow to closely to the original. For example, the character FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is completely done away with. But, that said, the movie does do a great job of capturing the feel of the novel.

889072,3,630448187X,"Released in 1997, ""The Relic"" stars Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore as a biologist and detective in Chicago who team up after a series of brutal deaths at the Chicago museum where the former works. James Whitmore, Linda Hunt and Chi Muoi Lo co-star as scientists at the museum.

This is a gory monster movie made with a whopping budget and an intriguing sci-fi concept concerning the creature, but its hindered by bad lighting and bland characters. As far as the former goes, this is one of the darkest movies Ive ever seen that doesnt take place in a cave. Regarding the latter, Sizemore is good, but Miller is only serviceable with the rest of the characters being merely okay. I suppose it doesnt help that the story lacks dramatic drive. People laud the film for not throwing in a romantic subplot between the protagonists, but SOMETHING needed done to make it more compelling. How about throwing in some teens visiting the museum  something! Nevertheless, there are some legitimate scares, the kills are utterly savage and the monster, location and sets are good.

The film runs 110 minutes and was shot at the awesome Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, with interior/studio work done in Los Angeles.

889262,4,630448187X,"I love it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's a  horror movie!!

Usually when a book is turned into a movie it becomes a shadow of what made it great. Not in this case. The characters and fast paced script kept me jumping and guessing all through the movie even though I knew what was coming.  This one is played serious and for the most part it works. And there are some seriously great moments in it  This was an entertaining movie and compares well with the book. Even for a mid 90's movie, The Relic accomplishes what it sets out to do. Builds nice suspense and the effects are pretty good for its time. The Relic is a great monster horror movie. It has a slow, tense build up, and starts to pick up about halfway through. The monster design is great, but some of the CG is bad; it didn't bother me much, though, considering the movie is about 15 years old. And this monster can walk on walls, take huge leaps, run on four legs and swim, which I liked because it added variety. I also liked how they explained how the monster was created and what it really was in detail. The museum/lab setting was also great

The Relic (1997) is a big budget creature feature that gets many of the basics right. Involved with the unraveling of a dark horrific mystery, director/cinematographer Peter Hyam's film grabs and holds your interest. Leaving behind a trail of blood and severed heads, the dreadful threat is kept nicely hidden in the dark, until near the very end. When the creature is finally revealed, its exact nature and form are a surprise, rendered with some excellence by Stan Winston's team of special effects wizards.  This is one well-conceived and believable story featuring themes such as rapid evolution and mixed DNA. Furthermore, Penelope Ann Miller is superb in the leading role. While the good stuff doesn't begin until about 40 minutes to the end, it sure gets good, with the suspension, action and terror rising.  Of course, the main attraction of The Relic is the monster. Similar to Jaws, the actual monster is hidden for much of the film. There, however, the similarities end. When the wait is over, The Relic reveals itself to be an excellent beast, aesthetic and even beautiful. It's stupendously brought to life with excellent animation. The scenes with the monster wouldn't look out-of-date on the screen today.

It is worth rewatching . Sizemore and Miller give stand out performances, and there is a great support cast, special effects, and sets. The story of a tribe of South American natives calling to a god to destroy their enemies and then using a special plant to turn a normal creature into a flesh eating monster is good. When a archeologist sends back boxes of leaves to the museum and a incomplete figurine they don't think much of it until people are found dead and decapitated.  To me this could fit into SciFi as well and I recommend it if you enjoy a good creature feature.  The book was better but all in all the movie is well made.

The Relic has strong violence and gore (a good amount of it is done off screen, though). No sex or nudity.

SPOILER ALERT
Centering around the gala opening night of a museum exhibition in Chicago, ""The Relic"" follows evolutionary biologist Dr Margo Green and Lt Vincent D'Agosta as they unravel the mystery of a monster that holds the entire museum in its grasp. With the power down and the people trapped in the museum, they have to find a way to escape.

The majority of the film is set in Chicago, mostly at the Museum of Natural History. John Whitney an anthropologist with the museum, is exploring in Brazil, and sneaks aboard a ship bound for America, to try and find some crates with artifacts that he intended to send back to the museum. The crates are not aboard, and are sent to the museum by another route. Weeks later, Whitney's boat is found floating in Lake Michigan, with no survivors on board. Police detectives Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore), and his partner Sergeant Holllingsworth (Clayton Rohner) are assigned to investigate the bizarre murder of the entire ship's crew.  The decapitation of a guard at the museum, brings the police to the scene, and the facility is closed down, just before an important exhibit is about to open. D'Agosta questions the staff, which includes Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller), Dr. Ann Cuthbert (Linda Hunt), Dr. Albert Frock (James Whitmore), and Dr. Greg Lee (Chi Muoi Lo), but no one knows anything.

In the crates Whitney sent back are a stone statue of the devil god ""Kothoga"", and some leaves with a strange substance attached. Dr. Green begins an investigation of the unknown substance, which eventually provides some leads to what is happening. Under pressure from the Mayor, the museum reopens so the grand opening of the new exhibit hall can take place. It is on this night that the mysterious beast strikes again, creating a disaster of epic proportions, as the facility loses electrical power, and goes into lockdown, trapping people inside, and then soaking them with water from the fire sprinkler system. Emergency electrical power is limited, leaving the occupants mostly in the dark, as fire rescue and the police attempt to get into the building.

Driven by the quest to find the monster, the film moves at a brisk pace. With an ""all business"" approach, it doesn't get involved in the character's personal lives, and romance is not a factor. Like some major studio productions, the story takes a few outrageous and unbelievable turns, designed to crank up the level of excitement. While these elements do add to the drama, they also tend to make the movie ridiculous, as The Relic escalates into a bloodfest.

The film's strong points include a unique creature, a suspenseful and creepy atmosphere, and a story based on both science and an intriguing legend. The vicious Kothoga is surprisingly fast moving, and truly scary. The suspense is particularly dense, as D'Agosta and his team probe a series of underground tunnels below the museum in the darkness, with search dogs.

The Kothoga has an uncanny ability to appear wherever there are people, so death is almost a constant. There is no help from the outside, so at the end it mostly comes down to Dr. Green battling the creature, in an overdramatic but well staged final act. It's ridiculously dumb adventure, but one what is still fun. On the Bluray edition, Peter Hyams (Outland, 2010, Timecop) provides a rather dry but informative commentary track. Serving as both director and cinematographer for the film, Hyams offers more of his thoughts on moviemaking a separate interview.",1443052800,,6598,4.7526223776223775

I recently saw the dvd of The Relic. The movie taken on it's own merits is a good horror/thriller. The characters are well portrayed given the limits of reducing the scope of the novel into a 2 hour film. The biggest disappointment in the film for me was the complete abstinence of FBI agent Pendergast. While I understand the need to streamline the characters and action in making a film, the absence of Pendergast is inexcusable. The Relic, after all, is the first book in the Pendergast series. He is the main character and to leave him out entirely makes no sense to me. His absence diminishes the film for me. The chief reason that I watched the film was to see how the film makers depicted the Pendergast character and who would play Pendergast.",1437350400,,899,4.590062111801243

I know that books are almost always better than the movie adaptation, however this is the absolute worst adaptation I have ever seen.  The only thing that made it from the book to the movie is the ""heroine's"" name, Margo Green.  I do not understand why the writers felt it important to change names of characters, combine two (male) characters into one, and make the character a woman, make Greg Kawakita a total moron, when the character in the book was far from that.  The most important and by far the most interesting character, Agent Pendergast, was nowhere in evidence. They even changed the name of the machine that eventually figured out what the creature was.  And the creature itself?  Nothing at all like the description in the book and actually very stupid.  Up until I read Relic, Stephen King's book, Pet Semetary, was the scariest book I had ever read.  Relic far surpasses it.  The writing of Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston is outstanding.  Whole sentences, paragraphs, and pages put me right in the museum; I felt like I was right there, scared to death and not knowing what was happening or what was going to happen next.  This movie was a joke.  I am not surprised that there have been no more Child/Preston books made into movies.

if you Love this excellent 90's thriller/Horror
get this blu-ray version by Lionsgate
the High Definition transfer in 2:35:1 widescreen looks excellent, nice sharp & clear picture quality
much much better transfer than the very old dvd version

massive difference compared to the Dolby digital mix from the DVD version
plus new special features on this blu-ray release
THE FILMMAKER'S LENS- new interview with Director Peter Hyams
he talks about how he was a cinematographer first and then became a Movie Director later
he only talks briefly about the Relic, how he Directed the film, how he approached the filming
only goes for 10mins, could've been a better longer interview for sure
he could've talked more about The Relic
however Peter does talk about The Relic more in detail in the new Audio commentary
that he's recorded for this blu-ray version
very indepth commentary to, Peter talks about the script, the casting, the filming etc

Tragically this blu-ray release is out of print now, the blu-ray was released 5 years ago now so it's now out of print
but tragically these days very hard to get a copy, because you'll be paying over $40 for a new copy
it's best to buy a used copy/like new copy
there's still lots of listings for this blu-ray on amazon.com so it's worth it for sure to pay extra to get the blu-ray version

That said, I wish I had not read the book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child first, maybe then I wouldn't have been so disgusted and offended by this movie. This movie does not do the masterpiece of the book justice. I can't believe they had the gall to name their cheap version after the book, when not only did they remove two of the major characters (Pendergast and Smithback), they changed the setting completely (I'm frankly surprised they kept the Amazon in the story), but so many other facts are gone.

The whole purpose of a book is to envision what the book conjures up, to use your imagination. Example, my idea of what the monster looked like, was NOTHING compared to the low-grade, laughable excuse they came up with. I've never understood why film makers insist on making movies based off books if they can't do it right. It's insulting.",1429315200,,1003,4.661016949152542

And, both the novelists, (a team), and the producers of this film brought us a new creatureone born from both science and myth. Pretty neat.

Also, it's satisfying to see some of the corrupt, entitled individuals receive their comeuppance. Conversely, it's unsatisfying to see some of the decent and hard-working individuals suffer a horrendous death.

I enjoy ""creature features""  if they are approached somewhat seriously (Pumpkinhead, for example, might be a fun scare, but it's pretty low brow), and though the science in the Relic might not have much basis in true genetic fact, the subject of how the monster came to be is sufficiently cloaked in biological verbiage & data to satisfy all but the most exacting of viewers.  I would suggest to anyone thinking of purchasing this movie that they do so with the full understanding that this is a very ""dark"" film - literally; I mean most of it takes place in the dark, so you have to be watching it in a dark room to see everything with any detail and clarity.  I'm sure the filmmakers felt this added to the ambience of the movie, and in a darkened theater, they were right on - for a Kindle, not so much.  The story itself is easy enough to follow - anthropologist in South America gets fed some scary brew by a primitive tribe & is transformed, after which he gets on a boat heading back to his office at the Museum in Chicago, where his arrival brings chaos, death, etc., and the hero & heroine are forced to find a way to stop him.  Penelope Ann Miller isn't my favorite actress, but she does a decent job as an evolutionary biologist who works at the museum; Tom Sizemore as her police detective counterpart is really great.  I vaguely knew of him before this film & now I love him.  There are lots of other small-part characters to enjoy (for good or bad).  If you dislike blood/guts, you'll have to close your eyes now and again, but it's not too bad.  The autopsy scene of the first (known) victim is among the funniest I've seen on such a morbid subject (remember that this movie was made before ""CSI""...).  The creature itself is a little hokey, but it definitely has a high ""disgust"" factor - lots of teeth, drooling, really raspy/creepy respiration and big (really big!) claws.  If you aren't sure you are interested enough to buy, please rent - it won't be a waste of the few bucks you spend, just watch it in the dark with a friend/loved one close by (I watched with my daughter, who loved it).  And a note to any museum personnel who happen to read this - the catalyst for most of the action in the film (the opening of an exhibit on ""Superstition"") - coolest exhibit idea EVER!!",1413849600,2,2445,4.370860927152318

Horror/Mystery/Thriller
January 10, 1997
USA
Director:Peter Hyams
Writers:Douglas Preston - novel, Lincoln Child - novel
Stars:Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, James Whittmore, and Linda Hunt

This one I have been watching since it first came out.  It has good rewatchability.  Sizemore and Miller give stand out performances, and there is a great support cast, special effects, and sets.  The story of a tribe of South American natives calling to a god to destroy their enemies and then using a special plant to turn a normal creature into a flesh eating monster is good.  When a archeologist sends back boxes of leaves to the museum and a incomplete figurine they don't think much of it until people are found dead and decapitated.  To me this could fit into SciFi as well and I enjoy revisiting it from time to time.  I recommend it if you enjoy a good creature feature.

890615,2,630448187X,"A museum doesn't seem like a logical place to find a giant primordial reptilian monster with a taste for brains.

But that seems to describe ""Relic,"" which is loosely based on a novel by Douglas J. Preston and Lincoln Child. It tries mightily to add the ""Alien"" monster-movie aesthetic to a more cerebral setting, but the sludgy pace and massive plot holes make it a chore to sit through -- and no matter how many gory body parts it flings at you, nothing really horrifies.

A ship arrives in Chicago with its crew horribly murdered, and Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) has no idea what has happened. The cargo -- crates from a roving anthropologist -- is sent to the Museum of Natural History for their ""Superstition"" exhibit, but Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) finds nothing inside but a stone idol and leaves covered in a strange fungus.

Then a security guard is brutally murdered in a bizarre way -- he's decapitated, his brain is torn out and his hypothalamus goes missing. D'Agosta immediately shuts down the museum and begins searching for the killer, but Green begins to suspect that something more bizarre is afoot. But even if they can figure out what the killer is, they may not be able to stop it.

Just a warning: fans of Preston and Child's thriller series will be hugely disappointed in ""Relic."" The unique lead character has been completely cut out of the story -- imagine an adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" without Frodo Baggins -- and the plot is transformed into a generic monster movie with generic characters. It feels sort of like ""Alien,"" except without the feeling of being trapped (since they can easily leave the museum) or the build-up of tension and horror.

One of the biggest problems is that the movie never really gets SCARY. There are scenes of gore and graphic violence -- heads pop off, a man is torn in half, explosions -- but it's not really frightening. The plot also proceeds at a glacial pace, with predictable twists (wow, what's going to happen at the gala?) and a big explosive finale that feels out-of-sync with the ponderous story.

It's also almost impossible to see what's happening in many scenes, except vague dark shapes careening through small rooms. Would it kill somebody in the museum to switch on the lights, or did the monster magically turn off the electricity?

And there are so many gaping plot holes and illogical elements that your brain might rip ITSELF out. For instance, we are supposed to believe that a mindless beast the size of a bull rhino is somehow able to remain CONCEALED in a museum. How? I don't know. Then again, the museum has a bizarrely large number of damp, dripping tunnels.

Most of the characters are pure stereotype -- Tom Sizemore does what he can with D'Agosta, but the character is basically a standard hard-boiled New Yawk cop with no real development. I assume that Miller's Dr. Green is meant to be the heroine, but her condescending insistence that everything that is not purely based on cold hard science (like anthropology or psychology) is ""superstition"" just left me wishing the monster would eat HER hypothalamus.

""Relic"" is mildly diverting as a monstrous-creature-running-amuck-eating-brains flick, but the glacial pace and massive logical holes left me wishing for more monster, less tedium.",1368489600,,3312,4.858156028368795

890754,5,630448187X,"First of all, I loved the book Relic and its sequel Reliquary.  It didn't bother me that in this case great liberties were taken with the book when they `transformed' it for the screen.  I love the movie as is by not comparing it to the book.  No matter what, you will always have the source material, intact; it's not as if it disappears when a movie adaptation comes out.
As for the criticism that most of this movie suffers from poor lighting....I can't argue that point.  The lighting is peculiar and not a little deficient.  The revelation that surprised even me is that the director Peter Hyams filmed it that way on purpose.  He referred to it as ""exotic light"" consisting of shadow, darkness, hints of shape and movement; the less details seen the better.  He wanted confusion; he wanted terror built from what isn't seen as well as what is seen.  I might not agree with him on all of that as I am one of those people who like to see everything.  I don't believe that much darkness serves his purpose as well as he thought it did, and yet, this is one of my favorite films that I return to often, also upgraded to this Blu-ray version.  It's just as exciting the umpteenth time viewed as the first.  But it is, literally, dark, even in scenes that didn't make sense.  For example, the work space in the museum is also poorly lit.  How could scientists work under such conditions, they have to see what they're working on.  In addition, the museum is also dimly lit, how are you supposed to see the exhibits without proper lighting?  I think a better balance could have been struck between these scenes and the ones in the tunnels where darkness made sense, was even expected.  But of course no amount of second guessing is going to do any good at this point.  The movie is what it is and I love it.  The acting is great, the story moves along quickly, there's plenty of fright along the way as well as humor, and then of course, it stars the incomparable Linda Hunt.

While I understand their reasoning for not including Pendergast (the FBI agent from the books) it hurts the story of Relic so much that it goes from being a high intensity monster-thriller, to a failed B-movie.

The two things that actually made the movie unwatchable is the constant darkness, and the terrible cuts. Frenetic action with byte sized dialog and pitch black lighting is not a good recipe for a monster movie.",1322352000,8,563,4.686868686868687
890823,4,630448187X,"The Relic (1997) is a big budget creature feature that gets many of the basics right.  Involved with the unraveling of a dark horrific mystery, director/cinematographer Peter Hyam's film grabs and holds your interest.  Leaving behind a trail of blood and severed heads, the dreadful threat is kept nicely hidden in the dark, until near the very end.  When the creature is finally revealed, its exact nature and form are a surprise, rendered with some excellence by Stan Winston's team of special effects wizards.

The majority of the film is set in Chicago, mostly at the Museum of Natural History.  John Whitney an anthropologist with the museum, is exploring in Brazil, and sneaks aboard a ship bound for America, to try and find some crates with artifacts that he intended to send back to the museum.  The crates are not aboard, and are sent to the museum by another route.  Weeks later, Whitney's boat is found floating in Lake Michigan, with no survivors on board.  Police detectives Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore), and his partner Sergeant Holllingsworth (Clayton Rohner) are assigned to investigate the bizarre murder of the entire ship's crew.

The decapitation of a guard at the museum, brings the police to the scene, and the facility is closed down, just before an important exhibit is about to open.  D'Agosta questions the staff, which includes Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller), Dr. Ann Cuthbert (Linda Hunt), Dr. Albert Frock (James Whitmore), and Dr. Greg Lee (Chi Muoi Lo), but no one knows anything.

In the crates Whitney sent back are a stone statue of the devil god ""Kothoga"", and some leaves with a strange substance attached.  Dr. Green begins an investigation of the unknown substance, which eventually provides some leads to what is happening.  Under pressure from the Mayor, the museum reopens so the grand opening of the new exhibit hall can take place.  It is on this night that the mysterious beast strikes again, creating a disaster of epic proportions, as the facility loses electrical power, and goes into lockdown, trapping people inside, and then soaking them with water from the fire sprinkler system.  Emergency electrical power is limited, leaving the occupants mostly in the dark, as fire rescue and the police attempt to get into the building.

Driven by the quest to find the monster, the film moves at a brisk pace.  With an ""all business"" approach, it doesn't get involved in the character's personal lives, and romance is not a factor.  Like some major studio productions, the story takes a few outrageous and unbelievable turns, designed to crank up the level of excitement.  While these elements do add to the drama, they also tend to make the movie ridiculous, as The Relic escalates into a bloodfest.

The film's strong points include a unique creature, a suspenseful and creepy atmosphere, and a story based on both science and an intriguing legend.  The vicious Kothoga is surprisingly fast moving, and truly scary.  The suspense is particularly dense, as D'Agosta and his team probe a series of underground tunnels below the museum in the darkness, with search dogs.

The Kothoga has an uncanny ability to appear wherever there are people, so death is almost a constant.  There is no help from the outside, so at the end it mostly comes down to Dr. Green battling the creature, in an overdramatic but well staged final act.  It's ridiculously dumb adventure, but one what is still fun.  On the Bluray edition, Peter Hyams (Outland, 2010, Timecop) provides a rather dry but informative commentary track.  Serving as both director and cinematographer for the film, Hyams offers more of his thoughts on moviemaking a separate interview.",1321488000,2,3688,4.983660130718954

890825,3,630448187X,"I'll admit it I have a soft side for creature features, but I wanted to take them more seriously especially this one but instead I watched it with an open mind. There wasn't anything particularly awful about the film but I felt like I've seen some of the concepts of the movie one to many times such as the two main characters... they begin to have feelings for each other and I originally thought that one of them was going to die but it was too clich for that and it had a somewhat Hollywood ending with a predictable big explosion scene!

Plot: It was discovered by a man of science, it was brought to a museum to be studied by scientists, it was eaten by a science pet (The Beetle), and now science has taken an evolutionary step and just in time for a new exhibit to open and now it's chow time for the creature that is part reptilian, part bug, and part human that will decapitate as many people as it can in a 109 minute process!

Review: The film screamed Hollywood made to me like crazy! It had some good terrifying moments and some humorous comic-relief along with intense scenes to make up for the boring scenes. Plus another problem with the film was that it was a bit to dark and I felt like I was watching AVP-R: Alien vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) but just a tad bit lighter version! The special effects were phenomenal for the time and the acting was superb! But the film was a box office flop and it didn't deserve that. It had good and bad things to it.... Even if it had one big story for one small area of back story to cover it!

Acting: As I said before the acting was superb and it definitely was. It wasn't the best performance I ever saw but it was pretty awesome!

Gore: Decapitations, a body torn in two, and blood splatter! It had a liking to those decapitations.

Bottom Line: Hectic and a Helluvalot of fun! This is a blast to watch but it needed some touch up's here and there.

Rated: ""R"" for Monster Violence and Gore, and for Language

890830,3,630448187X,"Although it's not the worlds greatest horror movie, it's an enjoyable film. There are a number of actors that you'll remember from previous generation of actors and current actors. It's got a few laughable jokes in it. I don't think anything will ever come close to ""Stan Winston's"" horror creation such as the Alien in his collection of creations. Then again it's up to the Director of the film to decide how scary the creature should be and the film budget. We've just become spoiled by the CGI effects created today. I hadn't scene the movie in a couple of years. For some reason I think part of a scene was cut when actor James Whitmore is confronted and he meets the creature. As usual it's your cheesy good old fashion horror movie but entertaining. I like to watch it every couple of years. If you're a horror movie buff then you can appreciate it. If you want to crap scared out of you then it may not be for you. A fairly decent storyline and you do appreciate it when a character gets what you want them too when watching a movie. Opps! Did I give something away? You can always buy the regular DVD it's not necessary to buy the Blu-Ray version, unless it's at a cheap price. The only thing as usual with this movie is, I don't like it when they take their time to reveal the creature. This movie is worth 3 and 1/4 stars.",1295827200,2,1332,4.332
890831,1,630448187X,"Where should I start... This movie takes a great story and completely ruins it.  While I can understand the people who changed this into a movie taking SOME liberties with the story, what they did was unforgivable.  There were times where they took the words from the original story literally word for word, but, since they eliminated the MAIN character, they had someone else say it.  Special Agent Pendergast is the glue that keeps this story moving and interesting, yet they felt it was a good idea to write him out of the script.  Heck, they even changed the gender of a character and made Dr. Cuthbert into a woman and have her played by Linda Hunt (the boss on NCIS LA).  They change the name of the monster, and turn it from a reptilian primate into what looked like a wild boar and an ant had a wild night together.  While the beginning of the movie keeps loosely, very loosely, to the original story, somewhere around halfway through, it completely abandons the story and becomes truly unwatchable.  It was truly painful to watch.

In the end, you had a movie that resembled the book in title only.  They also lost a great opportunity to continue the story, for Preston and Child wrote another book a few years later where someone is cultivating the plants that created the first Mbwun (the real name of the monster) and selling them as a narcotic creating a new batch of monsters that start to attack underground NYC.  Unfortunately they either killed the necessary characters off in Relic, or they did not even write them into the script.  In my opinion, if you want to get a truly scary version of the relic, put this movie in the trash can and go to your local library and pick up the book.",1294963200,3,1703,4.514657980456026

890905,4,630448187X,"I was all for expecting The Relic to be another run-of-the-mill monster movie. Boy was I wrong. This just might be the best monster movie I have ever seen, with a believable and action-packed story, good acting and thrilling special effects - thrilling because they bring something thrilling to life; the monster.

Centering around the gala opening night of a museum exhibition in Chicago, ""The Relic"" follows evolutionary biologist Dr Margo Green and Lt Vincent D'Agosta as they unravel the mystery of a monster that holds the entire museum in its grasp. With the power down and the people trapped in the museum, they have to find a way to escape.

This is one well-conceived and believable story featuring themes such as rapid evolution and mixed DNA. Furthermore, Penelope Ann Miller is superb in the leading role. While the good stuff doesn't begin until about 40 minutes to the end, it sure gets good, with the suspension, action and terror rising.

Of course, the main attraction of The Relic is the monster. Similar to Jaws, the actual monster is hidden for much of the film. There, however, the similarities end. When the wait is over, The Relic reveals itself to be an excellent beast, aesthetic and even beautiful. It's stupendously brought to life with excellent animation. The scenes with the monster wouldn't look out-of-date on the screen today.

Like many excellent films, The Relic has one awful DVD cover. It says nothing about the thrill and even beauty of what is found within. I use the term ""beauty"" loosely, there's some gruesome things that happen but nothing that steps over the line too much. Overall, The Relic is an excellent film. Bear with it for its first half and watch with your eyes glued to the screen as it draws towards its conclusion.

I was hoping that somehow the producers would find a way to brighten the image enough to make details missing on the already too dark DVD visible but alas the original dark cinematography of the movie can not be remedied. The sound was okay although I felt the dialogue was too low comparable to the cranked up sound effects. All in all a big disappointment.",1278633600,2,526,4.27
890907,4,630448187X,"As I am sure anyone reading this review has seen the movie, I will primarily focus on the BD.  Though it must be said, ""The Relic"" has held up nicely over time.  The story of a monster on the loose in a museum, is the stuff of Saturday afternoon creature features.  Complete with a pretty young scientist, and a hard edged cop, all spouting off wonderful creature-feature dialogue about old legends and genetic mutation.  What makes the movie work so well is a very nice prestigious cast:  Penelope Ann Miller as anthropologist Margo Green, Tom Sizemore, reminding us why he was such an edgy leading man despite his personal demonds, as detetective D'Agosta.  Supporting players like James Whitmore, Linda Hunt, and a wonderful cameo by the late Audra Lindley as a foul-mouthed coroner make this the classy gala affair the movie centers on, and makes the proceedings feel more convincing and grounded than they are.  Above all, the A-movie production values, courtesy of Gale Ann Hurd give the movie some fabulous special effects both CGI (which have held up nicely) and awesome creature effects by the late Stan Winston.  Peter Hyams also managed to get the clearance to let this movie be a hard R-rated affair with lots of gore, decaptiations, and body splitting carnage.  Very fun, guilty pleasure of a movie...which while not a runaway hot, still did better than anyone expected and it has developed a loyal cult following.  The SD DVD was fine, but had many problems such as compression noise and the low bitrate couldn't handle the crushing shadows and blacks director Peter Hyams employs.  It is all the more of a treat that the Blu-ray is given first-rate treatment by LionsGage.

""The Relic"" is a dark movie.  Very dark.  Peter Hyams, acting as his own DOP, employs heavy shadow and even in lit scenes, nothing burns brighter than 12 watts it would seem.  This has been a common complaint of the movie as it obstructs seeing the creature or the terrific CGI.  On the documentary and commentary, included for the first time on this disc, he makes a great case for why he did it this way.  His point is about focusing on natural light only, even when it is too dark, such as the scenes in the tunnels where the police are tracking the beastie...he points out that if they need flashlights to see, why not only show thw audience what is visible by flashlight or other available lighting.  This makes a good point and the movie would not have been as effective had it been subjected to increased lighting.  It allows us to feel like we are in the dark with them, not knowing what lurks off the light of our flashlight.

The Blu-ray transfer makes for a real treat.  The MPEG 4 AVC encode allows the blacks and shadows to render more detail and keeps it true to Hyams' vision.  There is no artificial brightening or porcessing used.  Hyams made his case in my mind, and the tranfer is free from all of the DVD's flaws, and it looks marvelous.  The CGI effects look detailed and textured.  There are crushed blacks, but they are from the original master, and not the BD encode.  In short, it looks the best it ever has since the editing bay.

The sound is a powerful DTS HD-MA 7.1.  It is a house-shaking, booming, exhilarating mix that is immersive (we can hear dripping water from every channel) with wonderful ambient and directional effects, but once the monster mayhem begins, the movie is full of devastating bass and exciting effects as the creature lumbers, runs, rips heads off, gets set on fire, etc.  It is a terrific transfer.

The disc has spare feature, but LionsGage recorded a new commentary by Peter Hyams, a new documentary on Hyams, and the theatrical trailer.  These items are sure to please fans of the movie.  The price is right at $10-12 bucks at most retailers for this first-rate catalogue title. I have watched mine 4 times already.  If you love the movie, this is a MUST own.

It's sort of a horror/thriller with a classic B-movie premise, yet the story feels somewhat original, and is pretty interesting.  On top if this, the creators were able to get the atmosphere just right (a phenomenon where the visuals, sound, and acting seem to come together in perfect harmony, allowing the viewer to feel like their experiencing something more than just a movie).

Atmosphere is how I separate the great movies from the just good, and The Relic has it.  The slow reveal of the monster is perfect and the lighting sets the perfect mood for the story (most of it takes place in near darkness).  The sound is quite good also, highlighted by the monster again, which creates some pretty hair-raising noises.  The dialogue is sharp and is delivered by some great actors.  The leads Penelope Ann Miller and Tom Sizemore are flawless and have good chemistry.  Tom is able to use some of his sarcastic wit and Penelope comes off kind of hot in a sexy librarian sort of way.

This may well be the perfect monster movie:  Talented cast that's actually well-utilized, playing likeable or suitably annoying characters, briskly paced build-up towards the climax, some truly suspenseful moments and great sets and FX.

Unlike many of the reviewers here, I saw the movie long before I read the book, so was able to view it much more objectively.  I don't know if this would have been possible had I read the book first, as there is one glaringly drastic change made to the storyline for the movie:  the omission of what is probably THE major character!  The book is the first in a series about FBI agent Pendergast.  Imagine Kyle Mclaughlan's amazingly capable and geekily eccentric FBI agent Cooper from the TV show ""Twin Peaks"" as an albino with a southern accent!

It would have been fun to see a film director's take on that character.  But I think of this movie as a stand-alone film (which is probably why Pedgergast was written out of the script;  at the time the movie was made, I don't believe there were any other Pendergast novels written yet, and he may have seemed too bizarre a character for a typical audience to believe in while they were already trying to believe in a monster) while I continue to enjoy the Pendgergast novels separately.",1210982400,4,1407,4.776859504132231

891023,2,630448187X,"I realize that most movies based on books are not going to feature everything from the book, but I was disappointed at what they did with this movie. Gone is Agent Pendergast (who was a prime character in the book), and  the movie seems to end as quick as it starts - i.e. the book built up a lot of suspense before the Exhibit opened. The movie has 3 murders and then viola! In the book, you feel the police chief is an idiot for letting the exhibit go on in spite of all that has happened. In the movie, it really seems like there's no reason it should not. Many small scenes from the book were included that did not make any sense at all because of stuff they left out.

Many scenes were just unrealistic - like when the rescue squad goes in through the glass roof. They are all looking down - don't they see the first man, and then the second man, get eaten? The monster isn't hiding in a corner. Right after the first man is loudly attacked they still drop the second. And I'm sure a rescue squad would have shined a flashlight down before they went down.

Everything else aside, the movie was just too dark! You couldn't see anything most of the time. There were times when the screen was completely black for 5-10 seconds at a time, and most of the other time you could barely see anything. It made the movie that much less enjoyable.

They moved the action from New York City to Chicago for some unknown reason, and got rid of two of the best characters - Pendergast and Smithback.  Also, I was repeatedly annoyed by the lighting, or lack thereof, while watching this.  It seems that about half of the movie you spend straining to see what is going on in all the shadows and the other half you're rubbing your eyes because they are shining bright lights directly into the camera *ouch*

Aside from that, I liked the monster effects and I liked that they actually let us *see* the monster; so many ""monster"" movies never give you a good look at what is running about - I suppose because they don't want to be bothered actually creating the whole thing.  But this one had a great monster, and the pacing was good as well.  I wanted to smack around some of the annoying rich people, but I guess that was the point!

The movie transports us to Chicago and loses that New York edgey beat that pulses throughout the book. And, as the novel introduces a certain charizmatic hero that is later found in several of the authors work, he is missing from this film, as is the book's charm.

The archetype of evil being a universal constant in all cultures no matter how primitive coupled with an innate look at superstition and legend in all cultures was the perfect mixture of plot setting to make this an enjoyable movie.

  I say ""the first viewing"", because quite a bit of the movie is devoted to figuring out ""what"" is going on and ""why"". Once you learn the reason, the movie shifts to a more standard horror survival role until the end where it reverts back to trying to explain itself. There are several entirely enjoyable sequences of plain old scariness and tension if you are able to successfully suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride.  In fact, several of these scenes are enojoyable enough on their own to cause me to watch them over and over from time to time.

The film is more than a little erratic in what it takes from the book and what it invents anew and I felt somewhat cheated.  One notable lack is Agent Prendergast, who goes on to occupy a major role in the series that followed the original novel.  The film gives away too much of the plot right away and misplays the characters a bit.

What I did miss is that this horror film based on a genetic premise (gen migration) which is at least partially true isn't all that bad if you wait long enough to forget the book.  Tom Sizemore plays Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta who is investigating a deserted ship is found floating on Lake Michigan.  When towed in, it is found that the entire crew has been decapitated.  Suddenly a parallel murder happens in the Museum of Natural History and D'Agosta is faced with a museum full to twisty passages and a killer with a taste for human brains.

The lady of the story is Penelope Ann Miller, who plays Dr. Margo Green.  And who had a stronger part in the book.  She is an evolutionary biologist struggling for grants at the museum.  She finds the clues that lead to the origin of a beast that in short order is terrorizing all the attendees an evening party for the museums new exhibit on superstition.  From that point on it's flying body parts, screaming crowds, and wild chase scenes.

Given the lack of exceptional acting, interesting scenery, and cool side effects, the film still manages to be a bit better than the mediocre impression that I originally had.  Or, perhaps, it is more enjoyable in the smaller format.  It does have an interesting premise, and few films feature evolutionary biologists.  So you will probably enjoy The Relic, but most likely, you won't remember it.",1137974400,4,1904,4.552941176470588

891094,5,630448187X,"Maybe I'm just naive, but I completely fail to understand why this movie receives so much unfair negativity. As a life-long fan of horror and monster movies, I was thoroughly entertained.

My spouse and I caught ""The Relic"" in an overly chilled and packed theater with some friends of ours a short while after its release, years before I ever bothered to read the book, and the DVD has been a mainstay of our collection ever since.

While I do admit the novel did go into a little more detail and flesh out more of the movie's weaker moments, I was still able to accept both mediums for what they were. I've never been the type of person who rips a movie to thousands of gory shreds because it didn't perfectly follow the novel it was based upon. Movies hardly ever stick to their source media one hundred percent; that's just a given. I was an avid reader of Fangoria magazine at the time, so I was already aware of the creative changes that were made within the screenplay. There would be no Bill Smithback or Detective Pendergast. The brain-sucking creature, Kothoga, was actually called ""Mbwun"" in the book, and the film was set in Chicago instead of New York. I've since read the Preston/Child novel from cover to cover and these differences, while admittedly extreme in comparison, do not adversely affect my positive opinion of the film. I rather liked Tom Sizemore's portrayal of Lieutenant D'Agosta. He seemed right for the role. James Whitmore, Linda Hunt, and Penelope Ann Miller were also uniform picks.

But the real star, hands down, is the creature, itself! This ""thing,"" for lack of a better word, is straight out of your worst nightmare! It reminded me, quite frankly, of something I'd expect to see in a ""Resident Evil"" game. It's presence throughout the film was precipitated by a wet sort of snuffling sound. It was enough to set my every nerve on edge, sitting in that dark theater, because I couldn't begin to imagine what could possibly be making that sort of noise! And when it was finally revealed during the film's final reel, I was not disappointed. The legendary Stan Winston is known for his contributions to such films as ""Aliens, Jurassic Park, Predator, and Pumpkinhead."" But here, he created a unique and truly terrifying beast! From the moment it shows up, all bets are off and this movie plunges into classic old-school monster mode!

If you haven't already been able to figure it out, by virtue of my enthusiasm, I had an all out blast with this flick! It won't appeal to everybody, I grant you, but it was far from the irredeemable garbage that so many here are making it out to be.",1129161600,2,2619,4.6501079913606915

The part that especially disgusted me was when the museum beast was turned into a cartoonish 20 foot fireball galloping through the museum like Clifford, the Big Red Dog. I was as embarrassed as I was livid. What a waste! I guess it's a good thing that they left Agent Pendergast out, because they probably would have cast somebody like Keanu Reeves to play him, and that surely would have given me a stroke.

But if you're looking for a monster movie with a dumb monster, dumb characters and only one exciting scene at the very end, then you just might like ""The Relic"". The story is that a reptilian creature snuck into a museum, and killed a security guard. A few dumb detectives go into the museum to find out how the guard was killed. They want to keep the public from coming to the museum until the problem is dealt with, but the museum's staff insists that the public be let in for the grand opening of their latest exibit. People come in by the thousands. Right in the middle of the tour, the creature causes some more problems, and the museum's security computer locks the whole place down. Will the hundreds of thousands of no-name people be trapped inside for the monster to feast upon? Nope. Large, metal security doors start to close, like that scene in ""Titanic"", and at least a billion people make it out alive. Instead of feasting on a sea of people in the main room, all the monster does is kill off two lovable dogs and an old, crippled guy. About twenty guests become trapped in the museum, and at least seventeen of them make it out alive. A stupid police guy leads those people out of the museum through a sewage system. He's carrying a shotgun, but he never fires it, even when the monster is coming for them, and he has a clear shot. Why did he have a shotgun to begin with if he couldn't figure out how to make it work? A hundred-thousand billion people survive who you could care less about. Instead of having many expendable no-name characters get eaten, most of the few characters who do die have names and backgrounds. I hate this movie so much! This movie make Hulk angry! Hulk smash terrible monster movie that rips off scenes from better movies! And I should probably mention that it takes a good hour before anything that looks like it could get scary happens. If you still want to see this lame film, regardless of what I say, read this: In the scene where the monster is chasing the large group of slow-moving idiots through the sewers, the monster gives up on the chase. Yeah. Sad, isn't it? Still care to watch? Don't. I beg of you. This is pure filth, and a real let-down for horror buffs like myself.",1124150400,3,2359,4.450346420323326

Unfortunately, he doesn't show up until the third act.  In the meantime, there's a handful of off-camera deaths and a lot of set up.  It's handled well enough, and the acting and directing are solid on all accounts, but for a lot of monster fans, it might take too long to get to the action.  Just hold on because it's worth it.

The last act is crammed with action / scares, and the monster is just plain neat.  And when he finally shows himself, he does a lot of damage, eats a lot of people, and just generally makes a helluva nuisance of himself.  All the buildup ultimately pays off because even the minor characters have personalities and seem like real people so that when they die, you feel something.

As for the monster, like the dragons in 'Reign of Fire' it's so dangerous that we humans have little hope but to run for it.  But never does the story seem hopeless, despite the situation, and suspense is maintained throughout.

Cast:  Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, Linda Hunt, James Whitmore.

Rated R for extreme violence, language, and lots of gore.

Running Time:  110 minutes.

A supremely underrated monster mash, ""The Relic"" is one of the better of its kind produced in the last 1990's.  Director Peter Hyams does a great job staying true to the acclaimed 1995 novel of the same name (written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child), using a great balance of humor and terror to entertain.  The premise revolves around a frazzled researcher (Penelope Ann Miller) working at the Chicago Museum of Natural History who happens to come across a strange shipment.  The shipments are empty besides a strange kind of plant life that is unknown to the scientist.  Miller thinks nothing of it until museum workers start showing up dead, jeopardizing the grand opening of the museum's biggest exhibit opening in history.

Tom Sizemore (in a refreshingly funny performance) stars as the detective assigned to the case, not realizing the terror that is running amok in the museum.  Both Sizemore and Miller work together to put the pieces of the mysterious deaths together, all the while attempting to survive against a fiendish beast of a monster that is eating everything in sight.  Both Linda Hunt and James Whitmore are very good as a museum coordinator and supportive old scientist, respectively.  Superb special effects (conducted by none other than the great Stan Winston himself, who created the ""Alien"" monsters), a fine ensemble cast, and a riveting musical score that gels well with the film.

The movie is based on the novel of the same title(ISBN: 0812543262), not the other way around as with so many novelizations of movies.  It's a good book and worth a read, if that is your cup of tea.

I certainly don't expect to see real heads rolling around the floor, but I don't expect to see the poor quality plastic or clay substitutions for them either.  The monster made no sense at all, particularly with tusks.  This creature is supposed to eat plants, for heavens sake.

Tuxedos and terror all in one huge building.

WIthout spoiling it, let me say that this is a great movie to watch with your girl. It is well made enough, it's just that the plot is so predictable and stereotypes abound. As the lead character (Penelope Miller) works hard on her science to compete for a grant with an Asian co-worker, the co-worker is made out to be sinister and crooked -- ala Fu Manchu. He is then futher denigrated as a coward when he flees the monster but ends up being out-maneuvered. He can write a grant but he don't know how to get the hell out of Dodge. Yeah, right.

Tom Sizemore appears in another macho role, and should thanks Wesley Snipes for making him a star in ""Passenger 57."" At any rate, he fears not the dark, slime or sounds that would tell anybody else that there's a monster nearby, let's book. NOpe, not Tommy boy. He and Penelope stand up to the mega-sized beast, who also has some human DNA, and during that time the guests are eaten up, one by one. A group of them escape through the tunnels under the Museum, but for the most part, the monster has a field day.

I have an unfortunate bias when it comes to this movie...because unlike the screenwriters I READ the book.  Now the movie, though a massacre of the printed horror novel, was not the worst movie in history.  And was NOT A RIPOFF OF ALIENS!! It had some tense and edgy scenes, not the least of which was the utter destruction of Special Weapons And Tactics team.

The Acting is passable but rather melodramatic.  The casting is decent when you find you can exuse the fact that they eliminated key characters from the script.

But not only are key characters missing as before mentioned but the charm of the book did not crossover to the movie.  But this is not a review of the book or comparison of the book to the movie.  In all fairness this movie is worth seeing if you have exhausted all better movies.  If you can think or find a few movies that aren't quite as cliched into the ""Unexplained and bizzare monster from some abstruse origin rampages on hapless people but then is destroyed by a jar of fromaldehyde."" section by all means watch them first.

In conclusion I give this movie 2 stars because it does not rate three.  If you are one of those people with time on their hands and has a hide thick enough for a bad 90s B movie then avail yourself!

The big question is whether or not you like to watch a monster movie for just being a monster that causes fictionaly mayhem. I grew up watching ""Creature Double Feature"" with all of those old monster movies.  Fact is most Monster Movies are the pits and there has not been too many that are very good at all since now a days they rely on so much CG. Also I find most people do not like the concept of a Monster to begin with; out side of the Vampire; which there has been more than a hundred titles with ""Vampire"" in it. Oh dear god now there is ""Van Helsing"" killing Vampires.

I am in the camp that thinks this film is a travesty of the fine book by Preston and Child. As I was reading the book I was envisioning scenes and situations and even the monster. You can't help it. The prose is so evocative and thrilling. When I found out theree was a movie? I was thrilled, and saw it about a week later. I was disappointed in every way but one.

First off and unequivocally, they had no business keeping the name of the book when two of the four main characters are eviscerated -- FBI Special Agent Pendergast, the heart of the team, and Bill Smithback, reporter. Unbelievable. So basically they called it Relic because they used the idea of a monster in a museum? Also the monster was not as scary as in the book, not even as scary as the drawing on the cover of the book, except in one scene. The movie did do a better job of having Margo battle the monster using her scientific skills, and one of the last sequences, where the creature is on fire and chasing Margo through the museum, is one of the best effects I've ever seen. It's spectacular. But there were also a lot of scenes that made me howl (with derision) whereas the book is fast, intelligent and scary as all getout. Too bad the filmmakers didn't have more respect for the book.
I tried to view the film as independent from the book, wondering if I'd be afraid if I hadn't read the book first, but I honestly don't think I would. This was a real wasted opportunity. All the material was there for a wonderful scary film, and I hope someone else remakes it somewhere down the line.

It was very entertaining,although it took a good hour or so to actually have the first good view of the creature,but the build up to it was presented in an interesting way and after that it was monster mayhem all the way. Also mentioned was that the acting in movies like these are not Oscar nominated types,but I've seen better acting in movies of this type,especially the Tom Sizemore and Penelope Ann Miller characters than most Oscar nominated movies which are usually movies nobody goes to see anyway because they are in reality pretty dull themselves and viewed by dull as well movie critics. Movies were always meant to be entertaining in the first place and monster movies especially. The Kothoga creature was a pretty fierce beast.

891321,5,630448187X,"What could be more terrifying than a slavering, mutated creature set loose in a vast museum?
I'll get back to that in a minute.
""The Relic"" is a semi-faithful adaptation of the spine-tingling book by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. I read the novel in college (procrastination at its finest), and immediately hoped for a film version. When I heard the project had been announced, I questioned some of the casting choices, but seeing the final product set my mind at ease. I missed the original theatrical run, but managed to catch ""the Relic"" at a bargain theater. I would've been happy to pay the full eight bucks!
Penelope Ann Miller caught my eye from the first reel--I wish I'd paid more attention to her career all along! The taut direction was nothing less than I'd expect from the man who thrilled me with ""2010"" and (later) ""End of Days."" The creature FX were heart-stopping, and their re-imagining of the story's conclusion was inspired.
So what's more terrifying than a slavering, mutated creature set loose in a vast museum?

891402,5,630448187X,"So there I was, beginning to watch ""The Relic,"" and snoring at yet another movie with a beginning sequence of a tribal ritual involving an American observer who ends up finding himself in danger. And then, two minutes later, my interest was peaked, and stayed that way for the movie's running length. ""The Relic,"" while not being the most original monster movie ever made, is certainly a good example for other movies to follow. The story is intelligent and involving, while the suspense keeps viewers involved in a way that is almost frightening by itself.
The movie begins with the aforementioned tribal sequence, then takes us to Chicago, where a mysterious unmanned shipping vessel has made its way to port. On board, Lt. Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) finds the mangled corpses of the crew, and does what any other cop would do: puts someone else in charge of getting the details. Days later, at the Museum of Natural History, boxes from the vessel arrive and get the attention of Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller), who finds a mysterious growth she believes to be fungus on the leaves found in the box.
Her examination takes a backseat to the story's main premise, which includes lots of gore and intensity. When a cop is found brutally mutilated in the men's bathroom at the museum, the establishment is closed for investigation, much to the dismay of curator Dr. Ann Cuthbert (Linda Hunt), whose worries about an expensive gala force D'Agosta to hurry his investigation. D'Agosta also stumbles across the fact that the victims found on the ship and the cop are found with a section of the brain removed, the section responsible for hormone release.
The gala goes on according to plan, but soon, things begin to go awry. The museum's security mainframe goes down, enclosing our main characters and a few party attendees inside. Whether or not the creature is responsible for this is left unexplained, as is his intelligence. But he certainly knows his way around the museum, and as the bodies begin to drop, the movie builds itself to an intense climax that has suspense leading up to it all the way.
Much of that suspense is due mostly to Peter Hyams, the director of photography as well as the director of the movie, whose use of shadow and light are a key element in bringing out the fear in all of us. There's nothing scarier than what we can hear but cannot see, and Hyams uses this to his advantage by supplying little light to the movie's most intense moments. Scenes in underground tunnels are lits by flashlights alone, while the museum's basement areas are dim and murky. Not only is this a fright factor, but it gives the movie a sense of style.
That fright is also kept up to speed by keeping the creature's full appearance in the dark until much later in the film. Done in live action and CGI, the monster is authentic-looking and realistic, a very convincing achievement. Not until the last half hour to we get a full revelation of the creature in its entire, and even then, the suspense still keeps coming.
The movie's story is intelligent, providing an explanation for almost every action and reaction seen on camera. The plot does more than just put its characters in dangerous situations, something that most movies of this genre are famous for. It gives the characters a chance to decipher the puzzle and figure out the monster's origins, and while those facts are somewhat laughable and contrived, they are convincing from the mouths of the actors, who do a stunning job on the film.
The movie also seems to poke fun at the many horror tactics used along the years, but keeps up a serious demeanor while doing so. Scenes involving key characters going into dark rooms, hearing sounds and running away, only to find their fears were in vain, give us a sense of relief but also build up a false sense of security. I practically wanted to scream at some of the actions taken by certain people, who, if they've ever seen ""Alien,"" should know better than to do what they do.
I had a lot of fun with ""The Relic,"" a movie that has been downed for its all-too-familiar similarities to other creature features. I found it to be a very refreshing film, one with suspense and thrills galore, providing a story we can actually believe with action and suspense that works us in all the right ways.",993772800,89,4316,4.687747035573122

However, the film does hold one's interest, especially with the great monster ""effect,"" a cross between ""Predator"" and a dragon, and the heroism and resourcefulness of the Penelope Ann Miller character.
There are two truly memorable scenes: 1) the creature ascending onto a SWAT team member as he attempts a rescue and 2) the ""revelation"" by the creature of its true identity.

Although there was some strained credibility in the origin of the creature, my gosh, this is a Monster Movie.  Since when did they have anything BUT a strained basis in fact?  It made just enough sense to get on with the elements that make a good Monster Movie: a viscious critter doing awful things to human victims; chases; hair-breadth escapes; a slow revealing of the monster; a resourceful heroine in peril....you know, Monster Movie stuff.

If you loved Ray Harryhausen's 50's monster movies (20 Million Miles to Earth, etc.) you will like this film.  If you DON'T like the genre, for crying out loud don't get this film.

Looking at the other reviews, I liked most of what others didn't.  I liked the darkness. The tunnels lit only by flashlight and the dark recesses of something so mundane as a museum were used exceptionally well to build suspense.  I liked the actors and thought they all did well with the material.

I thought Hyam's did a nice job of building to the climax.  AND the Critter here is a dandy.  Stan Winston did just fine and the combination of full size models and CG worked well and gave the Critter unusual and credible motion.

It is a gory movie done with style.  There are some nasty decapitations etc., but this is, after all, a Monster Movie.  If you like that stuff, you'll love this flick.

Of course Alien is a better-realized film, but there is still room for another Monster Movie. This is a first-class B movie.  It has every right to be judged on its merits, which are considerable.  I found it engaging all the way through.  I have a fondness for the genre.

891566,4,630448187X,"Contrary to what a number of critics and viewers may think, I actually loved this movie!  Certain aspects of the film which appears to have turned-off a lot of people (e.g. the poorly-lighted scenes) actually added  to the movie's overall ""scariness"", emphasizing feelings of  entrapment/helplessness/etc.  Loved to have seen Tom Sizemore in a starring  role, too.  The best selling novel was definitely scarier, though.",943401600,2,420,5.484375
891567,1,630448187X,"You don't see anything of the decor, every scene is too dark to catch details. The suspense is joke, once you see the preview, on know exactly what is going to happen. Special effects are way below standard quality. I  am a fan of Alien, but this movie really is a joke. DON'T BUY THIS.",941846400,2,286,4.2
891568,4,630448187X,Rather than being just another high tech special effects monster movie this little gem actually had some decent acting and moments of actual terror to it. Scenes like the persons trying to escape the monster through the the old  underground tunnel below the museum were classic. The director is to be  applauded for unique idea of using the Chicago museum as a back drop for this  movie. The darkness and over all creepiness of the museum gives just the right  amount of correct back ground for the monster to lurk around in so you are  never sure where it is going to strike next to chomp. The character  developement of the humans is not that great-but after all the star of the  movie is the monster-not the people. Although not as good as the Alien movies  for instance-for the budget it is definately worth a look see. Be prepared to  be really scared and grossed out!,918259200,,873,4.544871794871795

7872677,4,630448187X,"""The Relic"" is a horror movie?? Well, for me it wasn't. Starring Tom Sizemore, Linda Hunt (co-star in Criminal Minds"" TV series) and Penelope Ann Miller. Takes place in Chicago at a museum that is having a huge opening for a South American display and relics from some of the old tribes. Yes, there is a creature, nothing like I have ever seen in a film before; and he is a killer; and what attracts him to people? Something I have never known any creature or monster wanted.",1525305600,,475,4.409090909090909

7872679,2,630448187X,"I'm a hard-core & die hard Sci-Fi fan, and enjoy ""some"" Horror films... but not a fan of any Slasher films.  Anyone into Sci-Fi knows that it often has a bit (or a lot) of ""Horror elements"" in it.  Ridley Scott's Alien is a classic example of futuristic Sci-Fi Horror... ""The HIdden"" (a Cult film) is known for being a ""Contemporary"" Sci-Fi Horror film.

That being said, I really wanted to like this film as I had missed it as a wide release.  The premise sounded interesting, and once I started watching it, it was obvious that a lot had been spent on ""Production Values"" to make it visually appealing...

But all in all, I thought it was really awful... there was nothing new here that hasn't been done before.  I could really go into it and tear it apart point by point, but I'll leave it at this.

I actually work in Hollywood (in Live Action film production), so I know what I'm talking about... The Direction and Camera work were really pitiful. It's so totally clear that the Director and DP (Director of Photography) had NO heart or passion for the material and this was just a ""job"" for them... It's derivative and uninspired.  In fact, it was actually really boring.  The Acting was two dimensional at best, with the exception of the late, great James Whitmore (IMHO the true Star of Warner Bros all time classic 50's Sci-Fi feature ""THEM!""). The shots of the Monster (mostly low quality CG) were terrible, and in spite of Stan's studio adding some Puppet work, it always looked really fake. Basically sorry I bought this and a waste of my time.

Giving it Two Stars as there will undoubtedly be some poor soul out there who loves Sci-Fi Horror and will add anything to their collection.",1524441600,,1698,4.537704918032787

7872682,4,630448187X,"A fun ride. This film is criminally underrated, it stands out as a textbook example of a creature feature done right. Tom Sizemore always does a very credible of playing an everyman and it is no different here. Penelope Ann Miller does a very credible job and, as usual, chews the scenery with her smile.  I will say the story and execution is a very formulaic affair but that only adds to the charm of the film and makes it resemble a throwback to the horror flicks of the 40's and 50's. The only reason this film gets 4 stars is because the CGI was lacking. I think if they wanted to do this right they should have sunk more change into the effects. In the end it's a great flick and well worth your time and money  :)",1521504000,,720,4.172661870503597
