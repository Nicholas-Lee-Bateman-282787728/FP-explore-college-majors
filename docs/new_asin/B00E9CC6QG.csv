In the description of what the DVD's instruct you on is,""How to crack a PO box or Private Mail Box with a broom."" People watching these DVD's should be aware that it is a federal offense to mess with people's mail and mail box. Here is a link for you to check out and verify this information: [...]",1391040000,,390,4.283783783783784
8602939,5,B00E9CC6QG,"This guy, Larry Kaye, just looks like a detective (in an good way: an honest detective). And this two-disc set feels like a real education in the art and science of surveillance. I am currently a security guard, wanting to break into the field of private investigations, and I think getting this DVD set is a great start on that goal.

I've only watched it once, and I plan to watch it repeatedly, retaining more each time, I'm sure. But, upon my first viewing, several things stand out:

There are a lot of common-sense tips, home-remedy-type tricks,  as well as  valuable guidelines and theory, for all areas of surveillance --be it on foot, stationary, or in a car. He even goes so far, at times, as to use model cars on a model road, to illustrate shadowing techniques.

Larry gives a very useful instruction on how to set up a low-tech power source in one's surveillance vehicle, that enables you to run electronics while in the car, without the car running or draining the car's battery.

Besides all the training on surveillance, Larry gives tips on writing reports, as well as providing a model script any investigator can use on the phone, to win clients away from the competition.

I found his suggested in-field exercises for do-it-yourself training to be very inspiring, and I'm excited to try them out as soon as I get my surveillance gear together. (He also runs through various types of equipment an investigator might need, from the essential to the more advanced, with principles for using them.)

All in all, the training in this DVD set leaves me feeling inspired and informed, to get out there and make a go of private investigating. The only thing that's missing, really, is training on how to go about getting a license. But I believe that sort of information is covered in another course from the same author (""The Investigator's Ultimate Guide to Missing Persons and Fugitives"" --available at beapi.com) which I plan to purchase next chance I get.

About the production value of the DVDs, I found the editing and use of in-field locations and demonstrations, as well as actual case footage, to be enjoyable. It made it feel more like a documentary, as opposed to just an informative lecture (though Larry is also a good speaker).

The only criticism I can make of the production value is that Larry's vocal audio track only played on one side of my earphones. I don't know if that was a defect in my copy, or if the whole run is like that. But that doesn't deter me from highly recommending this DVD surveillance guide to anyone who, like me, is looking to break into the alluring world of the gumshoe. Thanks, Larry Kaye!",1378166400,,2646,4.683189655172414
