8291429,3,B001D2WUDY,"Visual: The flame:
It's pretty much the same over, and over again. What you see when you first put the DVD in and hit play is hardly any different than what you see at 05, 10, 15...20 minutes later. It looks nearly the exact same from beginning to end and appears to re-loop after 25 minutes or so. The fire looks to be mechanically enhanced with a fan stoking the fire but the flame exhibits no variation of intensity change. It  appears to be a filmed sequence that repeats. It is an actual log fire but it always looks the same for the most part.

Audio:
I don't care much for the Christmas carols over and over again. I prefer a natural and complimentary sound of a growing, peaking, then diminishing burning fire. You won't find that here. There is a rather loud, rumbling - whirlwind - bellowing sound that I assume must come from from a fan artificially driving the flames. You don't hear the fan. You hear what appears to be the enhanced effect the forced air has on the flame. That's what I'm guessing. But you do hear the crackling of the fire.",1449446400,,1054,4.372448979591836
8291430,5,B001D2WUDY,good dvd  everyone likes it  would buy it again  and hope to really enjoy it during Christmas next year at a good price!,1395705600,,120,4.130434782608695
8291431,3,B001D2WUDY,"This is similar to another Christmas Fire DVD that I own. You can turn off the music and hear just the fire. Fun! However (in this case) within a few minutes I started counting the airliners. Obvious it is that the person who made this lives next to an airport with a wide-body landing about every 5 minutes. This to me is most unprofessional. When you do a nature CD/DVD (or in this case) a fireplace DVD, film it in a quiet mountain cabin somewhere not next to an airport. For five bucks I can ignore it, but would like to meet the person who produced this and say what the hell? Good thing I'm an aviation historian and love planes, most people would be annoyed. After listening to this, let's say 100 times, I'm sure I could eventually identify the types of planes landing outside.",1386201600,,785,4.383561643835616
8291432,5,B001D2WUDY,"Great item!  Perfect background to wrap presents, decorate the Christmas tree, read a book etc.  Love the options of music/no music and the two realistic sounding fires.  I always love finding something so useful for so cheap!!",1386201600,,227,5.081081081081081
8291433,4,B001D2WUDY,"it is so cool to sit on the couch with a fire with no smoke and love the music and crackeling sounds  ty its cool, i will recommened this to other friends.",1356048000,,155,3.84375
8291434,5,B001D2WUDY,"Yes... for the low low price of $10.99, you too can watch wood burn!
To say that I love my Holiday Fire DVD is an understatement. I only wish they would finally release ""Watching Grass Grow"" to BluRay.",1325635200,,201,4.315789473684211
