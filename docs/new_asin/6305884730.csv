7899365,5,6305884730,"Even before realizing that this actually was an interpretation of the Dragonball manga (with which I am very familiar), this movie had me gripped.  Every kung-fu battle makes you wonder if you're sitting on the fast-forward button, and every embarrassingly mistranslated quip and exaggerated facial expression is sure to draw a laugh.  I was thoroughly amused throughout the entire film, despite its inconsistencies with the original manga.  But hey, I'm no purist.  I just like to be entertained.",1063929600,,497,5.333333333333333
7899366,4,6305884730,"This movie was great.  The characters' names have been changed, and the story doesn't exactly match up with the manga, but it's good for a laugh.  Horrible acting and cheap special effects just add to the fun.  I don't  suggest anyone who has not read al least the first volume of dragonball  manga, or anyone who is a fan of only dragonballZ, especially of the  English version, to watch this movie.  You will be confused, and the movie  isn't good unless you can make the associations of the characters of the  manga to the live action characters.",967593600,,549,4.577319587628866

7899368,1,6305884730,"I really love dbz so I decided to watch this movie because it is based on dbz. dbz=dragonballz. well anyway, the dragonball are called dragon perls and it is just weird if you know dbz and other dragonball shows like  dragonballz, dragonballgt and just plain dragonball. It took me a while to  ajust to the settings and everything. I do not recomend this movie to  people who truly know the world of dragonball because then you will get  mixed up.",961545600,6,447,4.55
