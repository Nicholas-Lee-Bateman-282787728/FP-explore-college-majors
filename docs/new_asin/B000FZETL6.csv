2594004,5,B000FZETL6,"At my house, Diego is a big favorite. I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves it! I was surprised at how well done the Diego dvds are-they focus on giving information about the animals, help memorization skills, and there are even some very basic physic lessons hidden in the story. I appreciate that there are valuable lessons learned and it is NOT just a cartoon. Very happy with this purchase.",1331251200,2,416,4.56

2594009,5,B000FZETL6,"What child doesn't love the heroic Diego?  Great introduction to saving the environment, saving animals, and the Spanish language!  Perfect for toddlers and young kids!",1222300800,,168,5.68
2594010,5,B000FZETL6,"Fans of Diego or Dora the Explorer will like this one. You get 4 episodes: Wolf Pup Rescue (maned wolf), A Booboo on the Pigmy Marmoset (they go to a healing tree to fix it), Diego Saves the Mommy and Baby Sloth, and Three Little Condors.

As in all Diego videos, the animals are in some kind of danger, and Diego rushes to save them in time, solving 3 problems and speaking some Spanish along the way.

All Diego videos are aimed at preschoolers, though my toddlers like them, too. By first grade they are no longer ""cool.""",1204588800,15,524,4.336734693877551

They are colorful, well thoughtout, with great different characters and different animals.  Always positive outcomes with showing the desire to help.  The interactive part is very entertaining for the young ones and educational.",1167782400,5,340,5.607843137254902
