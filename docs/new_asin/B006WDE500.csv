  I purchased this dvd for my granddaughter who believe it or not is only age 3. I bought it for her for a gift for her 4th birthday which is this week! She happened to walk in to my bedroom one evening while I was viewing this program on Nova.com. She was absolutely intrigued by the babies and the sight of the surgeries did not bother her at all, her only concern being the babies getting better. She now begs me to let her watch the video on my computer! Time she has a copy of this on dvd format for her own. I know she will love it! Strange but true. All of that being said, I too did enjoy this remarkable story!",1339977600,,780,4.984615384615385
