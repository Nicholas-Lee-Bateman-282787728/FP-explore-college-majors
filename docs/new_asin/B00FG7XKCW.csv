8615489,4,B00FG7XKCW,"For me, ""Psychophony"" is proof the Euro horror can be boobless, a**less, and goreless and still be entertaining. The film offers a mixture of ""found footage"" elements wrapped in a perfect chilling surreal melodrama. The acting and directing in this film is pretty tight with very few moments of ""down time"", where dramatic hook is concerned. The character study combined with the almost stoic personalities of the characters creates a nerving atmosphere. There is no emotion until emotion is needed in the approach to this film so when the drama does unfold it becomes heightened and tense. The paranormal aspect to the story is as chilling as it gets plus the whole ""is it for real or just media ploy"" aspect to the stories foundation (the experiments themselves) adds a discomforting component that kept me on guard. Normally you would expect this to hinder the entertainment value but Berraodo weaves in portions of the ""real"" stuff so seamlessly and effortlessly that it just adds an extra creep factor to the film's context.

The special effects are kind of on the cheaper side (think Syfy channel) but they are done with complete respect to effect to the overall film. There is no gore or nudity so this would easily be a full family sort of scare film. If your family doesn't mind subtitles. All in all ""Psychophony"" continues a strong line of horror in the Spanish community and over all European horror community in general. The story is captivating, the acting is believable, and the frights are hitting. It ends on a kind of expected clich moment but considering this is all genuine events being retold it all works to bring a pretty cool paranormal story to horror fans.",1432166400,,1682,4.840277777777778
8615490,4,B00FG7XKCW,"PSYCHOPHONY is about a group of people (five adults and one young girl) suffering from various mental illnesses -all having schizophrenia- who are taken to a house in order to be part of an experiment. A scientist is trying to discover whether schizophrenia, especially the visual and auditory hallucinations involved in the condition, has any connection to the paranormal. She's brought along an expert in the field, along w/ his collection of temperature sensors, audio / visual, and other detection equipment. It isn't long before one of the test subjects begins seeing a little girl that no one else can see. This ""girl"" then manifests herself to others. She is blamed for some property damage, but just might not be guilty. The group's host neglected to mention the graves of several children in the corner of the garden! During a session, one of the guests is attacked by some invisible presence, and suffers burns in the shape of hands. Many secrets are revealed, and many surprises occur. It all hits the fan when one of the subjects has a fatal heart attack, and the room erupts into a maelstrom of flying debris! Unfortunately for all involved, the worst is yet to come! The ""true"" story is original to say the least. It all seems to hinge upon the young girl of the group, and some tragic event from her past. PSYCHOPHONY is a perfect merging of the psychological and the supernatural. A low-budget gem. Spanish w/ English subtitles...",1389571200,,1446,4.834677419354839
