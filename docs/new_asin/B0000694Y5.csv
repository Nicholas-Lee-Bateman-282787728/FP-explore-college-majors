7965000,4,B0000694Y5,"While I enjoy the House Next Door, I can totally understand the complaints here on amazon.  Yeah the storyline is quite cliched.  It's not the least bit original in any area.  But, at least for me, all these cliches are forgivable since the story is suspenseful enough to make me content.  It's about a young wife played by A.J. Cook and her husband who move next door to an abusive husband (played by James Russo) and his wife (Theresa Russell).

We can tell the man is abusing his wife when in the beginning A.J. and Theresa's characters have a conversation with each other introducing their neighborly selves, and we hear James in the background getting angry and yelling at somebody which makes the wife nervous and realize she has to return home immediately.  That's the first sign of abuse!

The focus of the story isn't on James abusing his wife however, but rather, stalking A.J.'s character for snooping around too much.  A.J.'s husband spends most of the time away on business trips so we hardly see his character.  This gives A.J., James and Theresa reason to spend a lot of time together.  At first the abusive husband doesn't seem bad at all, despite coming off strangely quiet.  The scene where he introduces himself to A.J.s husband by telling his young son not to pick and play with guns is definitely weird.

James wants his new neighbors to come over and have dinner, as well as attend parties.  Everything seems fine at first.  In fact early on James even comes across like a good guy.  While playing pool at a bar, a man promises A.J. that if she can make this amazing shot he'll give her 20 dollars.  She makes the shot but the man says he was only kidding about giving her 20 bucks.  This upsets James and he beats on the guy, threatening him to pay up!  The guy knowing what James is like with his super mean streak, has a quick change of heart and hands A.J. the money.  Good man!

But the kindness is short-lived soon after when we see A.J. walking to a bathroom and seeing James and another man (the town cop) going through with a secret money deal.  We don't discover anything more about the deal, but we can determine from this that the cop and James are best of friends which makes it difficult for A.J. to call the cops considering the two will support each other over her.

Later on A.J. and her husband are attending a party at James house, and while attending to a goofy drunk woman in James bathroom A.J. looks out the window and sees another woman applying her legs over her husband's face.  This of course makes A.J. angry so she storms outside and demands he come home now.  Party's over!  By morning A.J.'s still ticked off at her husband and won't serve him breakfast.  Actually she does hand her husband some breakfast- a bowl of nuts and a beer if I remember, lol.  A reminder of last night's big party mistake!  It's strange the husband is written out of the story after this (for the most part).

When another party occurs at James house and with the husband out of town, a man sneaks up the stairs of A.J.'s home and gives weird faces in the door.  This frightens A.J. and prompts her to call the cops thinking he's an intruder.  The cop comes out but... has a beer with James, lol.  Yup, it's the same cop making a deal with James earlier on.  Oh great, there's only one cop in town and he's best pals with the abusive husband!

The movie often teases A.J. dreaming about James doing something destructive and initially confuses the viewer into not knowing if what's occurring is really going on or just a dream.  However on one occasion, what seems like a dream is totally real- that being James breaking into A.J.'s home (her bedroom specifically) waking her up and explaining that his wife (Theresa's character) isn't exactly innocent either, and that there's two sides to every story.  So don't go around accusing James of being a wife beater!

The story definitely gets worse after this, but not enough for me to hate it.  When A.J.'s husband returns home, at first he's angry that James broke into their home so he walks over and confronts him... only to return home happy with a beer in his hand.  Yup, James, his cop friend and the husband all shared a cool beer and considered the whole break-in as A.J. having personal problems due to a past traumatic ordeal.  I can't remember what it is now since I waited too long to write my review, but A.J.'s been nervous/skeptical after an ordeal she went through.  The husband basically sides with James and the cop when he shares secrets of A.J's past.  A.J. of course isn't happy at all with her husband's actions.

But that's not the only silly scene.  A friend of A.J.'s stops over to visit (played by Sean Young).  Upon being informed about the abusive husband next door and how James apparently buried his wife out back (hence the scene where James was digging up the ground late at night and buried something there) Sean wants to sneak over and dig up the body to confirm A.J.'s belief that James killed his wife.

Now given the earlier scene where we see James' vicious dog bark at A.J. after A.J. tried sneaking over to James house during a party she didn't attend, it's only logical that we'll find out the dog was actually buried here and not the wife, right?  And sure enough that's what happened.  So cliched!  James catches Sean and A.J. digging up his yard and walks up to them angry and doesn't buy into Sean's explanation.  SPOILERS- James actually did kill his wife, along with A.J.'s friend when she turned up missing the next day despite her car keys still remaining at A.J.'s house.  He just threw their bodies in the basement instead of burying them.

A lot of this movie is pretty silly granted.  The cliches are in pretty high number, but not enough to take away from the suspense.  At least in my opinion.  So I recommend the movie.  The acting and suspense is decent enough to make the movie recommendable, even if the story isn't up to snuff.",1496966400,,5965,4.513059701492537

7965004,1,B0000694Y5,"It is beyond me how this story was made into a full-blown movie...somebody surely must know somebody in Hollywood who pulled some strings. One of the worst movies I've seen in years! The acting is OK overall, bad in some places, but the worst thing about this movie is the storyline. No imagination, totally derivative, loose ends in the plot right and left! You sit there waiting for something to happen to tie all those loose ends together, but it never comes. There is absolutely nothing original, clever or anything of a ""twist"" in this movie. Most of the scenes are either unremarkable or completely farfetched. Sheesh--three stars average rating?--come on!",1259452800,6,662,4.972972972972973
7965005,4,B0000694Y5,"Ok, this movie is not Oscar  material. The premise is somewhat far fetched, and I wanted to slap the ""nice"" husband in this movie so many times it wasn't funny. However, this movie entertained me for the 2 hours it played, and I've watched it more than once. AJ Cook is fantastic and I'd really like to see her in more movies. This movie is a cross between a lifetime original and one of the old ""Hitchhiker"" episodes. If this is your cup of tea, try this movie. If not, just pass it on by,",1184284800,4,490,4.157894736842105
7965006,1,B0000694Y5,"I was foolish enough to rent this from my video store. I saw the name ""Travolta"" as the director, and assumed it was John Travolta. Later I found it was Joey Travolta! If these two are related, the talent stopped with John! This is the worst film I have seen all year! Cliche's, bad dialouge, terrible directing by this ""Travolta"" character, and terrible acting with a lame plot full of holes! I often wondered what ever happened to Sean Young and Theresa Russell. Now I know why I haven't seen them in the past 10 years: they are talentless has-been actresses who, for good reason, have been shunned from mainstream Hollywood! A.J. Cook, I must admit, did a good job with the crap she had to work with, and she seemed like Meryl Streep compared to the rest of this cast! The thin plot about a young couple moving next door to a psycho offers nothing new, and nothing scary. The only thing scary is that a releasing corporation distributed this piece of crap! (Granted this distribution label is a company I never even remotely heard of--even the label's logo design looked like something made in a grade school class) Even the soundtrack was below a typicl ""B"" flick! There is no excuse for this kind of film, as I have rented many low(or no) budget films that were very good as the people involved cared about making something entertaining. I never even heard of this film until last week, yet the theatrical release date says 2002?? Um, where did it screen at, a mental institution? This thing must have sat on the shelf for a couple years. Not even an airline company would screen this for passengers as they wouldn't have enough parachutes to supply the amount of people that would jump out of the plane trying to regain sanity after seeing this. Honestly folks, I am trying to be as kind as possible, but this type of garbage really makes me mad. It doesn't even have ""camp"" value to it! Even ""Plan nine from outer space""(which is garbage) seems GREAT compared to this, as there is NO point to getting this film made! If you accidently rent this, do the world a favor and put the DVD on cement, grind your feet on it till it's scratched beyond watching, then return it saying it was defective. This film is the biggest waste of time I have seen all year. Just pointless! Or at least complain to your video store for wasting shelf space to stock it! seriously folks, stay away from this horrible piece of trash!",1091750400,11,2416,4.518264840182648
7965007,4,B0000694Y5,"While this movie may not have all the flash of a ""hollywood spectacular"" it is worth while to watch.  In many ways this movie is more terrifying than a standard horror movie, because this premise could actually happen, and probably has.  The Acting is good, and A.J. Cook (Final Destination 2) is a very talented cutie, who really should be seen in more films.  I also was glad to see the lovely Sean Young (Blade Runner) again, an equally attractive and talented actress who needs to be seen much more often as well!  Thereasa Russell (also a lovely!) is the victimized wife, and plays it well, illustrating the futility and sadness of a co-dependent wife of an abuser.  James Russo is the ""heavy"" in the film.  An overbearing, abusive husband and former Marine, who is also a womanizer and control freak.  The new neighbors, A. J. Cook and her often absent, traveling husband, are drawn into the world of their neighbors, the Schmidts.  Wild parties with young babes in the back yard, and invlovement in crime hinted at, One can see that things just aren't in order at the Schmidt house.  It culminates in a web of abuse and murder.  Well worth watching!",1087689600,12,1156,4.650246305418719
7965008,5,B0000694Y5,"IT TOOK MY WATCHING THIS MOVIE TO DISCOVER AJ COOK. SHE IS ONE OF THE MAIN STARS IN THIS FILM. SHE IS POSITIVELY BEAUTIFUL AND SHE HAS TOUCHED A PART OF MY SOUL THAT NO OTHER ACTRESS EVER HAS!

THIS MOVIE IS A GUARANTEED GOOD TIME IF YOU ENJOY GOOD THRILLERS THAT KEEP YOU INTERESTED UNTIL THE VERY END!
ASIDE FROM AJ COOK'S BEAUTY, THIS MOVIE STILL IS VERY GOOD!
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE STORY, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT TO SEE FOR YOURSELF.
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED!! ENJOY!
I'M ASSUMING THAT THIS WAS A DIRECT-TO-VIDEO RELEASE, BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN A LOT OF MOVIES RELEASED FOR THEATRICAL EXHIBITION!
THIS IS A NAIL-BITER FROM START TO FINISH AND IT IS SURE TO SATISFY FANS OF THIS GENRE!!!",1032998400,5,818,4.283870967741936
7965009,2,B0000694Y5,"I like horror/suspense movie's, so when I saw this at a video store, the cover looked real exciting, as much do, so I rented it. It's about a new young couple, in their 20's,they just bought their dream home. But the neighbor's next door to them, have secret's that Lori & Tom,(young couple), don't know about, yet. Helen Schmidt,next door neighbor come's over to introduce herself,(Theresa Russell),very friendly,and want's Lori & Tom to come over for Dinner, so they accept. When they are introduced to Carl,(Helen's Husband), Lori see's how mean verbally he is to his wife. To hurry up, the movie was okay, but not worth renting, the plot was already given away on the cover, as Carl might not be who he seem's. Well Lori left Helen in one night cause of Carl hurting her, a few day's later Helen is missing, Lori find's out that Carl has killed more than just his wife.  He buried her in the backyard,and the other's. One morning Lori wakes up, to see Carl reading a bedtime story to her in her bedroom,her own house. He sorta threaten's lori,leaves, then with her husband away on a trip, Lori take's it into her own hand's.  Carl break's in, & attack's Lori, little did he know, she was waiting for him. After the struggle, Lori finally shot's Carl Dead. And the movie end's there. My opinion,really it's a 1.5*** movie, rent something that you don't know whats going to happen, and pass on this one...~Thank's~",1031097600,6,1416,4.637450199203188
