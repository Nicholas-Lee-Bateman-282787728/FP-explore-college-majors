Christians and Christian families who believe in GOD.Because everytime I look at this vidio,I always feel the same feeling that only a Supreme Being or Creator GOD could only design and create a hidden world that clearly shows GOD's in all nature. I hope other customers will want to buy this vidio and enjoy the experiences this vidio will bring to every viewer. I enjoy this vidio every time. Sincerely: Tim Kemp  P.S. Christian HomeSchoolers watch this vidio and write an essay of their experiences with this vidio. They could show the vidio in Churches and after showing the vidio. The Christian HomeSchoolers could read their essays to the Church congregation and their Pastors. It's such a good vidio always.",1341705600,,799,4.9185185185185185

8237764,5,B0010EFGBI,"Bought this DVD recently. The colors are stunning on a 37"" LCD screen. Can be played with or without the music, and the music is lovely. DVD plays in a loop; no need to restart it. While it is divided into sections by title,the music and images flow continuously. Adds a lot to the decor of the room; nice to see when walking by. Also nice to hear the music from other rooms in the house. Definitely recommend!",1234656000,2,410,4.269230769230769
