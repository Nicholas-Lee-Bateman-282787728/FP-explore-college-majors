8534144,1,B000WGLAVK,"This was such a scam and rip off! It was a VHS that was transferred to DVD. The product description was not accurate and neither was the vide0 listing. All Nite and Megamix 2004 were not even included in this DVD. It was poor quality, very unprofessional and was not even broken down into separate videos it was 1 mish mosh of poor garbage! Im furious. I wouldn't even give this product or seller 1 star if I didn't have to put at least 1 star. Shame on the seller!",1486425600,,465,4.177777777777778
