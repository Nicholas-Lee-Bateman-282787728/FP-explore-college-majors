262503,4,6300216438,"Fedora hat on his head, beer belly sticking out, Robert Duvall gut-walks through this film.

  Done two years after the French Connection, Robert Duvall makes his own angry and effective character of Eddie

Ryan, NYPD detective.

  Duvall was not widely known at this time. But he acts, in this film. He makes a real person out of what might

otherwise be a cliche. For a man from Manhattan Beach, California, he crafts a wonderful guttural New York

accent. He is profane, casually racist, unattractive and crass. He offends this reviewer by how he refers to

Latinos.

  But his performance is not about politics. It is not genteel or pretty. He is not like the soft and caring

Steve McQueen of the film 'Bullit.'  Duvall wakes up at noon with a hangover and reaches for a cigarette.

  He is not likeable.

  But a smooth Latino racketeer, a graduate from Harvard University, who controls most of the Harlem

syndicate, kills Duvall's partner. Word leaks out that the dead partner was a

corrupt cop.  Everyone suspects that Duvall was on the take. His friends shun him.

  Stripped of the gun on his ankle and the gold detective's shield in his pocket, Duvall takes a tire iron from

his car and starts looking for justice.

  The cast is solid. Verna Bloom plays his lover, a hatcheck woman from the saloon where he works after the

NYPD has bounced him.  She is perfect as the woman who just wants a peaceful man to rely on. Duvall is not

that man. Too late, she learns it.

  Eddie Egan, the real-life French Connection detective, plays Duvall's boss and pal. He is as real as a curbstone.

  Watch this movie for the pure enjoyment of it all. The story moves well and colorfully, with these actors

leading the way,

262504,4,6300216438,"Badge 373, starring Robert Duvall, Verna Bloom and Eddie Egan, the real-life cop that uncovered the real-life French connection dope deal, is one of a spate of movies that were made after the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Connection/dp/B0006GANN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Connection</a>&nbsp;in 1971.

Badge 373 was based on events Egan said happened during his career as a New York cop. The film's storyline is based on Duvall's partner being murdered and the investgiation his character follows to find the killer while suspended from actual duty. There are several poorly-developed subplots including his character's racism and his relationship with girlfriend Bloom but the police action and story are worhty of your time and easy to follow. I have been surprised how badly this film was ranked by critics, especially after all the big name cop films -- including Academy Award&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/winners-I-ve-seen/dp/B000M341QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">winners I've seen</a>&nbsp;-- that are no better than this one. Perhaps it was poorly considered for 1973; today, it is clearly above the fold for the average police drama.

One element of this movie should delight anyone. While The French Connection featured the greatest car chase in film history (with those from Bullitt and Seven Ups not far behind), Badge 373 includes one of the funniest chases in film history. At one point, Duvall is being chased on foot by a gang of Hispanics when he commandeers a city bus and...away we go. If you can imagine a bus chase (think of something a lot funnier than what happened in that Clint Eastwood movie or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed/dp/6305176299/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed</a>) under pursuit by a half-dozen cars in New York City traffic, you can imagine my intellectual delight during this five-minute sequence.

This was one of many interesting elements in this underrated cop movie that should probably be released on DVD. It is an arrow in the quiver of Robert Duvall between the Godfather movies that is rarely seen and even more rarely thought about. It's a movie that deserves better, considering the state of reality-based police films in the new century.",1302739200,3,3032,6.952755905511811
262505,1,6300216438,"This film is great for some people who work in the police force and think police brutality should be commended and accepted as a norm. It is unfortunate that this ""old style"" of film making from Italian mafia stereotypes and Whites against Black and Brown has not changed since the origin of American cinema. The demonizing of Puerto Rican people is the focus of this 1973 film and it's equally sad to see a great actor like Robert Duvall play a vigilante ex-cop with an itchy trigger for ""Puerto Rican radicals."" It is no coincidence that the FBI and Police were beating, incarcerating and killing real Puerto Rican activists within the Young Lords Party during the time of this films release. It is interesting to note former Young Lords Party member Felipe Luciano's cameo appearance in this film as an actor. The erasure and amnesia of radicalism in late 20th century America is a phenomenon that benefits but a few.

262506,3,6300216438,"As long as there are criminals, films will be made about their exploits.. Though what we call ""a gangster film"" in the 1970's bears little resemblance to the classics of the 1930's, it is still a film about big-time criminals and organized crime... Only the baddies have been changed to assist identification...

""Badge 373"" is a case in point... It is a simple story, based on the exploits of Eddie Egan, a real New York policeman who also, for good measure, plays a part in the film...

Ryan, a New York detective, is suspended for causing the death of a Puerto Rican dope runner... Taking a job as a bartender, he learns that his old partner on the force has been killed... Then, with the law against him because he is no longer a policeman, and harassed also by the villains, he sets out to avenge his friend's murder...

The twist is that these villains are no longer liquor and heroin smugglers, big-time gamblers or bank robbers... They are Puerto Ricans... Some of them are men who seek to foment a revolution on their island; others, led by a sinister figure in dark glasses called Sweet William, are the crooked element who will supply the necessary guns and ammunition... Ryan, played by Robert Duvall, wages his own solitary war against both parties...

It's a rough, tough and ruthless film, in which Duvall is as brutal as his adversaries; towards the end, he callously chops down a night watchman in order to gain entrance to the Brooklyn docks... In fact, it is very difficult to have sympathy for any of the characters in ""Badge 373."" Perhaps this is intentional... Perhaps cinema audiences of the future will not require to identify sympathetically with the characters they watch...

Certainly, this was true in ""The French Connection."" No one could deny that it is a tremendously exciting film ... but could anyone have a feeling of sympathetic identification with the central cop character? Gene Hackman stirred the blood, but it was difficult to be concerned about whether he lived or died...",1232841600,3,2013,4.789625360230548

7806655,3,6300216438,"Not really worth your time. I had wanted to see this film when it first came out, but went to a baseball game instead, which I didn't really enjoy. I don't know if I would have enjoyed this movie as a teenager, but have to say I didn't really care for this movie too much. I wanted to see the film, because of its connection to the French Connection. Even Eddie Egan is not as good in this film as he was in the French Connection. The chase scene with the bus also does not have the same excitement of intensity of the chase in Connection. The person who really steals the film however is Henry Darrow, as the leading mob man. Come to find out he is Puerto Rican, despite's stage name. Also his interaction, a quiet moment with the character of Ruben, is also interesting, as they discuss the idea of revolution. Interestingly, these two men were activists in many ways, and so the charge of racism in the film by a Puerto Rican advocate group at the time is another interesting aspect of the film. I wonder what these two actors felt.",1496275200,,1035,4.312820512820513

This story is set in New York City in the early 1970's. Detective Eddie Ryan is suspended after a man he chased fell off a roof. Next his partner is killed. Ryan then investigates GGs death, and this leads him into many adventures. The scenes are based on true events. Ryan tracks down Sweet William, the gang boss who was responsible for GGs death (and others). The plot involves $3 million in stolen machine guns intended to start a revolution in Puerto Rico. The story ends with a shoot-out at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, now used for commerce since it was decommissioned in the 1960's. There are speeches and situations that date this movie, as well as the automobiles. The plot implies the politics of the early 1970's. It is a good or average action movie, based on the events seen by real life police detective Eddie Egan.

This reminded me of The French Connection, a better and more popular action movie. It came from the same sources (Eddie Egan, Pete Hamill).",1483488000,,988,4.607954545454546
