8358488,4,B0029XFOLQ,"I was looking for a current film regarding the human animal bond with horses. This short film is wonderful and current! It is something outside of the general area of pets and therapy horses. (Thank you!) Much of it is in subtitles but some speakers do speak english. I don't mind the subtitles and I think it adds to the cultral richness. I only gave it four stars because it is more of an introduction to this area of the world but there has been much written on it and teachers can use the film to accent India's culture, human animal bond, family bonds, animal welfare, breed rescue, aftermath of war and British occupation and so on. It is a great film to use as start to in class discussions.",1244073600,3,698,4.376923076923077
