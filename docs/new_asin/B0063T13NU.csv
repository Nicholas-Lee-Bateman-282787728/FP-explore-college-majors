A surprise that greatly pleased me. Happily BBC=1 is returning this series to the lineup. Due to be aired in early August/2013
it should be on DVD in about six to twelve months.",1376870400,2,282,4.895833333333333
8492220,4,B0063T13NU,"This is a BBC Scotland production that has already been aired on television; I missed the second part due to an important engagement with some liver damage inducing mates. So I was happy to finally see what happened. It is set in Glasgow on 1982, a young boy goes missing and turns up dead in the canal. Time to meet our hero - a struggling `copyboy' for Glasgow daily News', she is Paddy (Patricia) Meehan played brilliantly by Jayd Johnson. She wants to be a proper journalist and is starting from the bottom up in a very sexist male dominated industry. She also thinks that this murder may be related to one some years back, but no one is taking her too seriously.

Her boss is a chauvinistic tough talking walking clich&eacute;, played with aplomb by David Morrissey (who is always good value for money). When it transpires that one of Paddy's cousins has been nicked for the murder she ramps up her investigations to find out who is really involved. What follows is a nice, if cosy tale of deception and a slight mystery. The attention to period detail is as you would expect with the BBC, very good, I particularly liked the R. Whites lemonade bottle for instance. Everyone smokes all the time which is how it was in the eighties as far as I can remember. There is not a bad performance, but a special mention has to go to the uber brilliant Peter Capaldi. He does not have much on screen time, but when he does he steals the scenes as effortlessly as taking candy from a wee bairn (Scottish reference!).

Down sides are that it all does fit together too nicely, but this was aimed for the Sunday evening slot, when this type of thing is de rigeur, so I do not have a problem with that, but we also have to listen to some of Paddy's music on her `Walkman' and she don't half listen to some atrocious dross. It also has lots of good old fashioned profanity and some love interest that never really goes anywhere, but I still really enjoyed it. As I said earlier this was a two part show and it does break with the credits half way through, so do not think it is over as it comes straight back with part two. If you like a non too stretching murder mystery then I am sure this will be up your street.",1324684800,3,2204,4.3341404358353515
