7909923,4,B00000IC5C,"I ordered this to use with my 1st grade music class after we did a unit on ""Carnival of the Animals"".  Even though much of the humor was over their heads, they really enjoyed Bugs and Daffy's shenanigans and recognized the individual pieces as they were played by the orchestra.  My only note of caution is that because in today's language, some formerly innocuous words now have derogatory meanings, I deemed it necessary to skip over the introductory and closing remarks to ""Wild Jackass"".",1141862400,17,491,4.833333333333333
7909924,5,B00000IC5C,This is a great video for grandchildren in the age range of 2-6 year.  Its a splendid way to introduce children to the delights of classical music.  Our grandchildren insisted on taking our copy back to their home.  We also  recommend other puppet videos by Jim Gamble - including a) Peter and the  Wolf; b) Peer Gynt; c) Nutckracker Suite; and d) Hansel & Gretel.  They  are all excellent and the best of their kind.,946684800,33,417,4.48
