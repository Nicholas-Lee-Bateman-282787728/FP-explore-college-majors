8392833,5,B003A6TF02,I have watched this many times now and find that I learn something new every time.  The only negative is the sound because of being outdoors and hearing the sounds of the wind. I could still hear Ron and understand him clearly.  He does several demos moving to different locations including some studio work so you can learn how to use the hake brush and how to see the important elements of each outdoor setting.  I am very glad to have this video!,1495411200,,449,4.385542168674699
8392834,4,B003A6TF02,"This is the video that I used to introduce Watercolor to my art classes for decades only it was on tape back then. This item has three great ideas that are clearly demonstrated that make this the ideal place to start. First, a limited palette of colors and three brushes make the materials relatively inexpensive but more than adequate. Second, the techniques for color mixing and brush work are clearly explained. Finally, the basics of watercolor are clearly demonstrated. This is an unbeatable combination in one dvd.

The reason for the four star rating was that  the sound was recorded outdoors and the wind noise made it difficult, but certainly not impossible, to understand what was being said at times. I do not think you will find a better place to begin watercolor or explore new and simpler techniques if you have been a watercolorist for a while. I triied other material and this was simply the best!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watercolor-Fast-Loose-David-Charles-techniques-in-watercolour/dp/0715303694/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watercolor Fast & Loose (David & Charles techniques in watercolour)</a>",1293321600,11,1163,5.8352941176470585
