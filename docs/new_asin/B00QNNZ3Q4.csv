8692200,4,B00QNNZ3Q4,"Very interesting series. It was made in 1979,  but since historical facts don't change, it isn't out of date, even if Michael Wood's clothes and hairstyle were. I rated it with 4 stars because it really should be called ""In Search of the British Dark Ages""; there are a lot of places named in the series that are unfamiliar to audiences  outside of Britain. I found myself looking them up--which is probably a tribute to Wood's narration. I wanted to learn more about them.",1516838400,,473,4.619047619047619
8692201,5,B00QNNZ3Q4,"I first saw Michael Wood when he filmed his series on the Trojan War.  This series was even better.  This was his first TV series and he stuck to what he knew best, which was dark age England.  His later TV series got farther away from his expertise and they suffered for it.  His series on art history was really bad because he did not know the subject and he knew that he didn't, so he got numerous academic ""experts"" to fill in the details. Unfortunately, he didn't know the right art history experts because they were totally boring and they ruined the series.  The series on the dark ages has experts whom professor Wood knew and trusted and their explanations were as riveting as his.",1481760000,5,690,4.444444444444445
8692202,5,B00QNNZ3Q4,"While I needed my special ""Region-Free"" DVD player to even play this beauty, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Following Michael Wood's wonderful book of the same name, he managed to superbly tell the stories of these 8 very important kings from British history. One can only marvel at the content and delivery of Mr. Wood's presentation. Shows again he is a master story teller. This is just another reason that I wish they could do away with that ridiculous regioning system of DVDs and Blu-Rays.",1479600000,3,498,4.870588235294117
8692203,1,B00QNNZ3Q4,"I wanted this DVD collection very much. I was told when I purchased it that it would  take a long time to get here, I was fine  with that.  They never sent it.  I whole heartedly recommend this series; it's an update on the work Michael Wood did in the early 80s.
If anyone can get this DVD collection for me, I would  be most grateful.",1475020800,,336,4.03030303030303
