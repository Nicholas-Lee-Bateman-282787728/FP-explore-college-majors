4985956,5,B006GG3RF2,"This is a slasher film, nothing deep about it, but I find that kind of fare relaxing now and then.  Everything about the film - the plot, the action, etc. - works well if you are willing to suspend disbelief at least minimally.",1340064000,,227,4.27906976744186
4985957,3,B006GG3RF2,"When two members of a gay boy band are brutally murdered, they naturally assign a homophobic detective (James Vallo), partnered with a flamboyantly gay new transfer from Los Angeles (Shawn Quinlan), to solve the crime.  After the false arrest of a parish priest, as additional murders start to pile up, the FBI sends in a serial killer profiler (gay comedian Ant), who convinces them not to pursue the one real clue they have: a mysterious nun, seen in the area before each murder.

With cameos by Bruce Villanch as a farmer, Judy Tenuta as the aforementioned nun, and porn puppy Brent Corrigan as an oversexed frat boy, this politically-incorrect, campy romp has zero realism, numerous fart jokes, tired stereotypes galore, and an epidemic of chronic overacting.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, if that is what you enjoy. I found it amusing in places, but otherwise an unoriginal bore.  Three stars out of five.",1334707200,4,925,4.910256410256411
4985958,5,B006GG3RF2,This movie was very funny. Kept me laughing. Scott Grenke is amazing. Even the sex fiend detective was cute. Very creative and symbolic.,1332201600,3,136,4.956521739130435
4985959,4,B006GG3RF2,"Sister Mary is a dark comedy with mostly gay characters. Prior to seeing it, I had read only two reviews for it. One was mixed, and the other reviewer hated it. But I actually liked it. It is a very campy film, especially when comedian Ant is onscreen. And Brent Corrigan pops up in a cameo as a sex addict, and he takes off his shirt. Actually, many men take off their shirts in Sister Mary. Unfortunatly, that's all they take off, as there is no below the waist nudity. Sister Mary does have its problems. It is only fitfully funny, even if it never fails to entertain. And there are some sound problems, but only in a few scenes. Overall, though, Sister Mary is an interesting indie film with a twist that I didn't see coming.",1327708800,13,729,4.328467153284672
4985960,1,B006GG3RF2,"I've seen some 'turkeys' on screen in the past 40 years, but this one has to be the biggest 'gobbler' of them all!  It gives Indie filmmakers a bad name.  The acting and the direction (camerawork and sound) is god-damn awful.  Don't waste your money on this one.  But hey, this is only my opinion. I'm sure there would be some out there who who would enjoy this 'way-over-the-top campy'  film.",1327622400,4,393,4.47887323943662

4985969,4,B006GG3RF2,"It is  acopy of a 90's movie, where there is a serial killer. Trans.  Still, this movie has its moments, cute twinks and funny episodes. My fave is the gay detective from LA.  The movie also seems to be a parody or some sort of dark humour. Watch it. It is a good flick for a weekend with a date... It has its twist and popcult'ish flavour.",1471737600,,340,4.044776119402985
4985970,3,B006GG3RF2,"Very pre-indie, once you turn it on you won't be able to stop just to see ""who done it"", over all with all its flaws it was worth the time investment. Anthony Fagiano was worth the 90 mins lol.",1471132800,2,193,3.9743589743589745

4985973,3,B006GG3RF2,"Nothing deep here. Lighthearted and silly. Shawn Quinlan carried this movie. His character portrayal was excellent and typical. Not to take anything away from the rest of the cast, they all did a good job. Ant was great and, of course, Bruce Villanche's cameo was very funny.",1467590400,,275,4.872340425531915

4985985,1,B006GG3RF2,From to acting production values to settings to everything this thing was awful. Thank goodness I only had to watch the first few minutes 10 or so of it for free because I'm on Amazon prime. If I'd paid extra for this by renting it somewhere I'd be pissed.,1392940800,2,256,4.244897959183674

4985989,2,B006GG3RF2,"Okay, I rented this sorry excuse for a movie to see Brent Corrigan and he was there... far about 2 minutes.  I have no seen so many offensive stereotypes and crude gay jokes thrown into one film.
  If you want to watch something good, get JUDAS KISS.  Lord, I wasted 90 minuntes and $2.99!

4985990,1,B006GG3RF2,"I paid $2.99 to rent this movie from Amazon VOD.  That was $2.99 too much.  Had it been free on Netflix or Amazon Prime, I would have turned it off.  As it was, I played it to the end, but after about 10 minutes I had to mute the volume.  I basically made up my own dialog to go along with what was happening on screen.  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone unless it were free, but I myself would never watch this again even if it was free.",1344816000,,444,3.888888888888889
