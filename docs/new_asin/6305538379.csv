7892135,3,6305538379,"CaveGirl is a humorous tongue in cheek romantic comedy that follows the romantic relationship of bumbling modern day Rex and beautiful sexy pre-historic cavegirl, Eba. The movie follows Rex through a series of slapstick pranks and mishaps that culminate in his transport 25,000 years back in time where he meets and falls in love with Eba. Along the way, Rex becomes a man, saves Eba and the rest of the clan. Will Rex return to his own time, where Eba cannot possible fit in? Or will he stay and build a life with Eba and the rest of the tribe.

This movie is a humorous, and at times, a poignant, look at the trials, tribulations, and opportunities that young people often face as they come of age. Well worth a look.",1240876800,,719,4.488549618320611

Regardless, this is B-movie schlock at its best! Dan Roebuck (Jay Leno from  The Late Shift movie) plays Rex, a nerdy high school student, who gets lost  in a cave during a field trip and gets transported to the prehistoric era.  There, he meets Eva, the only cave dweller with breast implants, clean bear  skins and a just out of the salon perm. Rex finds that Eva's tribe respects  him more than anyone in the future ever did, and he must decide whether or  not he should stay with a prehistoric hottie or return to menacing bullies  in high school. It takes a brain surgeon to figure out the answer to that  dillema. Backed by a rocking soundtrack of synthasizers and lyrics like  ""We are mananas"" - the music in Cavegirl is just as much of a  guilty pleasure as the movie itself. Written, directed, produced and  photographed (whew!) by the great David Oliver, who's other works include  Mary and Bill Krane's Wedding and Abe Lincoln Middle Schhol Presents  Putting on the Kids Talent Show, (okay - I'm joking) it honestly proves  that no one man can helm an epic. That's why Cavegirl is 89 minutes long  and has a brief sex scene and tons of bathroom humor! Leave your brain at  the door and enjoy the spectacular tax write off. As for Amazon telling us  that this is available in 2010, well, put me on the list to pre-order this  great DVD! Even if I have to wait 10 years for schlock - at least it's good  schlock!",964828800,10,1556,4.396491228070175
