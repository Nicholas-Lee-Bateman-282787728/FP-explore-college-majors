8687485,1,B00PCSVMKC,"Luckily I just watched this at a friend's home. It was the worst garbage I have ever seen. The history is wrong. The sound quality is horrible. There is no plot. It was more like soft core porn in many  scenes and the music did too. And one of the girls axed in the stomach has intestines that look like sausages on a rope, then she had bigger issues than being axed and was living on borrowed time anyway. The blood was more like semi congealed jello and the sound of the ax hitting people sounded like metal on metal. Wth? Skip this and stay with Elizabeth Montgomery's version.",1524268800,,580,4.321100917431193

8687487,2,B00PCSVMKC,"After Lizzie (Jenny Allford) kills her parents the film moves to the present. A group of sorority sisters are grounded and opt to have a slumber party playing truth or dare. Lesley Borden (Veronica Ricci) is a direct descendent of Lizzie, so the dare is to hold a seance to contact the spirit of Lizzie. As this ""lame, boring and bad idea"" takes effect, the body count rises.

This is a low budget production. The blood squirts are CG generated. While the parents are getting chopped to pieces, Lizzie has no blood on her. Then suddenly she is covered in blood, including her back which never faced the splatter. The film is littered with this type of thing. The script is fairly bad as was the acting.

2 stars for the nudity
