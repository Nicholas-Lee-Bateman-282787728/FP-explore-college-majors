5080882,5,B007FFCA7Y,"I have been a fan of B&B since the begining of the shows creation in 1988. So when this came out I knew I had to have it. It has alot of coverage of Stephanie and Brooke, Taylor and Ridge, and some of Brooke and Ridge.
The price I paid is a decent price with the 2 dvd that you get in the set.
Highly recommend for B&B fans. !!!!!",1350691200,4,330,3.7285714285714286
5080883,5,B007FFCA7Y,I would recommend this DVD for any fan of The Bold and the Beautiful. Great sound and picture. Contains some great great episodes.,1348358400,3,130,4.695652173913044
5080884,5,B007FFCA7Y,"There are 15 episodes in this collection of the CBS award-winning daytime drama ""The Bold and the Beautiful"", a first in which fans can actually watch in the comfort of their own homes the series on DVD. What for me was surprising was the fact that very little, if any, promotion was given for this set by the soap mags and the on-line soap opera websites that I visit daily. This really is a true gem and I love it.

 The episodes deal with many classic stories, mostly complied from the last 10 years of the show including Eric and Stephanie's daughter Felicia having cancer, the revelation by hunky Ridge that his true love Taylor was indeed alive and the battle over Forrester Creations by brothers Ridge and Thorne.

 Hopefully if this set sells well enough Bell-Phillip Television productions (owner of the serial) will dive into their archives and release by editions. Love to see the beginning of the Stephanie/Brooke rivalry and the appearance of the campy and wonderful Darlene Conley as the delightful Sally Spectra!",1345161600,8,1027,4.818181818181818
5080885,5,B007FFCA7Y,I totally agree with you and where is sheila carter episodes and I really disappointed and I really want to suggest to edit a special DVD OF SHEILA CARTER.,1344384000,14,155,4.379310344827586
5080886,3,B007FFCA7Y,"Pre-ordered this and it arrived quickly.  Disappointed though at the selection of what is considered 'shocking'.  Given their history, Brooke and Stephanie deserve their own dvd set.  Disappointed there wasn't more of those two.  There's been too much good dialogue and disputes between those two talented actresses not to dedicate an entire dvd set to them.

I was most disappointed there wasn't one single episode that covered any of Sheila Carter's time on the Bold and the Beautiful.  No confrontation/fashion show dream sequence when Sheila first crossed over?  No Sheila drowning Lauren in the hot tub?  No Sheila holding the Forrester family at their home and then 'killing' herself?  If that wasn't shocking, I don't know what is.  No Brooke unhooking Stephanie's ventilator?  No Stephanie giving Brooke a gift wrapped suicide gun?  No Stephanie strangling Brooke with the phone cord?  Whoever selected these clearly needed my help.

Not that the episdoes they included shouldn't have been but they should have expanded on this idea.  Brooke/Stephanie and Lauren/Sheila fans will agree.

4156- After a romantic reunion in the rainforest, Ridge tells Brooke that he wants to start a family with her.

4361 & 4362- To Thorne's surprise, Eric chooses Ridge as Forrester's new leader. Nick finds out Felicia has cancer.

4544- Taylor returns to surprise Ridge in the cemetery while he digs for an answer.

4605- Brooke finds out that Stephanie faked her heart attack.

4606- Eric turns to Brooke after hearing about Stephanie's lie.

4628- Bridget tells Nicks that she lied about having an abortion

4835- Felicia is stunned to see Dante and Bridget kissing right before her wedding.

4850- While on her way to save Phoebe, Taylor accidentally strikes Darla with her car.

4913 & 4914- Taylor tells Thorne she was the one responsible for Darla's death.

5388- Donna discovers that Pam is her attacker.

5391 & 5392- Bridget finds out that Katie is pregnant with Nick's child.

5454- After a tragic car crash, Phoebe dies in Ridge's arms",1343606400,24,2040,5.1030303030303035
