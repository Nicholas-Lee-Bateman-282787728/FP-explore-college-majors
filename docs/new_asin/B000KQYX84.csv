8158751,2,B000KQYX84,"Buy the DVD to experience the magic of the 1939-1940 SF GGIE/World's Fair on Treasure Island, but don't expect the Amazon item picture to represent a DVD case picture or paper insert.

YUMHEART--PUT A FREAKIN' PRINTED LABEL **ON** THE DVD IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INCLUDE A DVD CASE & DISC CONTENTS INSERT!!

Based on the picture of the head of ""Pacifica"" in the main picture of this item, it looks like a DVD box cover that uses an image of the 1940 GGIE program.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  What you'll receive is exactly as stated by the other reviewer who noted you get ONLY a consumer-grade burned DVD with no label on the DVD and it arrives in a thin cardboard mailer.  There is NO DVD jacked/case, etc. and therefore no program insert.  The contents of the DVD are only noted on a printed black and white sticker on the outside of the mailer.  The problem with that is it gets destroyed when you open the DVD mailer!!!!!

I know the disc is only $[...]  and I mostly feel like I got what I paid for, but at least a paper DVD label stuck on the DVD is in order here if the disc isn't going to ship in a DVD case.  This really isn't optional and the written description should note exactly what you'll receive in the mail in addition to the wonderful video you'll see on the disc.  The video content is worth four stars, the packaging is worth zero, so I split the difference.",1254441600,,1375,4.27027027027027
