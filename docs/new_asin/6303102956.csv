559002,4,6303102956,"I have always loved werewolves, but this one has a twist.  Won't give the movie away, but Clint Walker spent 20 years playing goody two shoes roles in Hollywood, like WB's and ABC's ""Cheyenne"" and he did a lot of great films where he wasn't quite the good guy, ""Fort Dobbs"" sticks out.  But overall, he played a Saint.  This movie he doesn't. He's a bit older in it and so is Peter Graves.  But the movie is well worth seeing.  I loved every chilling moment of it, with the shocking ending.  I suggest you buy it if you are a fan of Walker's, Graves' or Werewolf genre.",1179014400,9,569,4.222222222222222
559003,3,6303102956,"The 1970s was a Golden Age of TV horror, most of it broadcast on ABC.

SCREAM OF THE WOLF does have some good creative lineage.  Written & directed by Dan Curtis.  Music by Robert Corbert (both men were behind DARK SHADOWS and NIGHT STALKER).  For that matter, SCREAM OF THE WOLF also features Jo Ann Pflug, the female lead in NIGHT STRANGLER.

But SCREAM OF THE WOLF is not one of the better 1970s TV horror films.  It's not even supernatural horror.  I won't spoil the ending, but there's nothing supernatural in this ""werewolf"" film.  It turns out to be a suspense film.

Of course, many supernatural horror fans also enjoy suspense films (e.g., PSYCHO).  But SCREAM OF THE WOLF is not a great suspense film, either.  It's okay, but very low budget, not too surprising or original, and not very interesting.

And this DVD leaves much to be desired.  It looks struck from an old 16mm film print, the kind distributed to TV stations.  Scratch marks show up throughout the film.  There are even GREASE PENCIL MARKS!

What are those?  Editors would often write on film strips with grease pencils.  Notations, such as where to trim, or fix a broken or torn film.  They wrote with grease pencils, because the grease could easily be erased afterwards.

However, this DVD's SCREAM OF THE WOLF transfer still has those grease pencil marks, which flash by on occasion, along with the scratches.  This is not a clean, digitally remastered print.

I've seen this film selling on Amazon -- this very same DVD -- for over $70.  Please!  Save your money.  It's worth a few bucks if you're a hardcore horror/suspense film fan.  Or a completist for any of the principal creative people involved.  But this is not a seminal work in horror film history.  It's hardly the best of the genre, or even of the genre's period.  Buy it for a few bucks, otherwise wait a decent price.",1179014400,8,1860,4.619631901840491
559004,2,6303102956,"Wow, did I ever really like this one. Just not up to the memory that I had of this one. Really just a a live action version of ""Scooby Doo"" without the humor. really shows it's age now.",1176768000,3,185,3.8947368421052633
559005,4,6303102956,"I first watched this alone at night when I was a teenage college student and it scared the HECK out of me! Of course it doesn't have the same impact 30 years later, but if viewed in the context of the time period and cinematic limitations of TV in the pre-Disco era, it is a well-done horror flic with Dan Curtis's inimitable mark on it (and Robert Colbert's unmistakable albeit a tad repetitive soundtrack: virtually identical to The Night Stalker, The Night Strangler and The Norliss Tapes - now THAT needs to come out on DVD!!!). The 'bad guy' is clear-cut from almost the very beginning - no surprises there, but the nighttime cinematography is excellent, and it's always a pleasure to see the cars, clothes and hairstyles of my old college years. Now, Hollywood come on: PLEASE get the wonderful suite of Movies Of The Week onto DVD, like Norliss, The Love War, Night Slaves, etc. - the nostalgic Baby Boomers are primed and waiting!! :)",1103414400,6,942,4.6467065868263475
559006,3,6303102956,"SCREAM OF THE WOLF opens with a guy in a convertible being attacked and mutilated (in our minds) by a growling ""creature"", that tears through the rag-top and smashes out the car windows. Not a bad beginning for a made-for-tv movie from the silly seventies. Dan Curtis (Trilogy Of Terror) seemed to be able to make things scary and suspenseful, even under the ridiculous constraints of network television. Peter Graves (Mission Impossible, Airplane) is John, a man brought in by the sheriff to figure out who or what is killing people in a small california beachtown. Clint Walker (Killdozer) is John's misanthropic friend Byron. Byron hates people because they're weak. He has more respect for the animals he kills than for modern man. John tries unsuccessfully to get Byron to help him find the murderer. Byron would rather wax philosophical about our pitiful species. So, the rampage continues, with some fairly frightening (for 70s tv) stalking / death sequences. Will John figure things out in time? Is a werewolf really causing these murders? Will Byron ever loosen up? Watch and see...",1079913600,5,1091,5.033149171270718
559007,2,6303102956,"This made for TV thriller is okay as a watch-it-and-forget-it viewing experience.  It manages to serve up some suspense for first time viewers.  As things howl in the night, the plot unfolds as a murder mystery with supernatural overtones.  The question is not only ""whom"" but ""what"" is doing the vicious killing.  The word ""werewolf"" is used carelessly.  Dan Curtis guides the helm as director.  Curtis, back in the leisure-suited '70s, churned out made for TV horror.  The script borrows freely from classic tales such as ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game.""  Clint Walker plays a macho hunter that stays strangely aloof from the local bestial horror.  B movie maven, Joanne Pflug, is the lady in distress.  She looks disapprovingly at Walker as he vies with her for Peter Graves' attention.  One can put one's own interpretation of why Clint is so interested in Peter.  Maybe it's the thick gray hair.  The production values, acting, sets, etc. are mired in the typical '70s TV bog.  Put it all together, and it's a harmless waste of 75 minutes.  Don't expect classic horror heights and you will do fine.  ;-)",1069113600,3,1134,4.858638743455497
559008,3,6303102956,"This is good television. The running time feels right at 78 minutes, and it wouldn't be able to handle a dragged out running time. It's great for any attention span, and the story unfolds at a good pace. The dialogue is very much of the 70's television variety, where some times I ask my self, ""do people really talk like this?"" And the disco score is cheesy, with very familiar, cheesy sounds. All of the killings are off camera, which I found to be a detractor, the photography is fairly boring, the colors are flat, and some things are un-focused. On the whodunnit side of things, I was hooked, and fooled when I thought I knew who did it. If you like watching movies as it's getting late and you're tired, this won't drag along too badly, you can probably sit through this one without feeling like you have to go to sleep.",1066003200,,826,4.405228758169935
559009,5,6303102956,"I have seen all of Clint Walker's films and tv series.  The reason I like this film is it shows a distinct contrast in his other ""good guy"" films and Scream of the Wolf.  His subtlety in portraying a psychotic hunter when compared to let's say,  the good law abiding homesteader in Night of the Grizzly is fun to watch.  I think he does an excellent job with this role as well as his other films.
The only gripe I have is the quality of the dvd.  I guess due to the flaws in the original master tape there are some of pops and clicks  and  some of the frames jump.  The frame jumping may be due to my dvd rom drive in my computer ( I  don't have a dvd player for the tv),  but for 5 bucks you can't go wrong.  The picture quality is still very good.",1013385600,3,749,3.9266666666666667
559010,3,6303102956,"Despite what the information on the cover says, this film was produced and directed by genre vet Dan Curtis.  People are being murdered in a California town.  Is there a werewolf on the loose, or is there not?  The combination of Curtis' no-frills direction and Richard Matheson's script provide the answers in this OK ""Movie of the Week"" telefilm from 1974.  Peter Graves and Clint Walker (in an atypical role) are the main stars.  It's a good time passer (less than 75 minutes long), nothing more than that.
The source print that Brentwood Communications has used is worn in spots, but is serviceable.  As is the case with their other budget releases, Brentwood includes a cartoon, an interactive movie trivia game, chapter stops, and a DVD dictionary of terms.",995673600,,763,4.875968992248062

7837324,5,6303102956,"Great early 1970's made-for-television movie. Spooky and atmospheric.  Great background music too.  This release is OK, but I would love to see a re-mastered version put out.",1374537600,,174,5.407407407407407
7837325,5,6303102956,This movie has got to unsettle the Clint Walker fans that expect him to always be Cheyenne or someone like him.  Byron is about as far from Cheyenne as you can get.  Walker uses his magnificent voice to create a character who is mysterious and sinister and downright spooky.  An excellent job of acting.,1360713600,,303,4.574074074074074
7837326,4,6303102956,"First off the movie itself is a great little time waster being more of a suspense/thriller then a horror movie with some decent actors  which include Clint Walker and Peter Graves......its a Tv movie for sure but one of the better ones ,more in line with Kolchak:The Night Stalker.........Its about adventure writer John Weatherby,played by Peter Graves is called in to investigate a series of brutal murders that has investigators confused. The clues are not clear and leave no clear trial. The tracks left at the murder site appear to be that of a wolf,or a man,or both..........Lost in his search for answers,Weatherby contacts his old friend Bryon,played by Clint Walker,a mysterious hunter and recluse,to help him track his unknown killer. His friend is not much help but may know more than what he's willing to say. The suspense and terror builds as danger lurks in the shadows of the night,Scream Of The Wolf will keep you on the edge of your seat and remind you to stay in at night and lock your doors because you never know what could be lurking in the shadows of the night.........now about the Dvd itself,the one you see by Amazon showing a real wolf on the cover by BCI/Eclipse is the one to buy to my understanding.........the other cover showing a cheezy werewolf is by Dollar-DVD,is exactly that,worth a dollar......cause the quality is no better then a old tv movie transfered to dvd they even cut your wide screen tv picture with horizontal bars on each side to make like a old tv screen and the extras are not worth anything............so I personally think paying $40.00 or more to these sellers for this version(the one with the cheezy werewolf) for a dollar dvd is a rip-off wait for a better copy to come along............hope this helps your buying!",1345680000,3,1772,4.790849673202614

7837328,5,6303102956,"I am a big Clint Walker fan, and was pleased to find one of his movies that is not a western.  This was a made-for-tv movie by Dan Curtis Productions.  Those of you who remember ""Dark Shadows"" are familiar with Dan Curtis style movies.  This is a good murder mystery plot.  Love Clint Walker!  Good supporting cast, also, with Peter Graves and the guy who used to do the Granny Goose potatoe chips commercials.",1257120000,3,410,4.486486486486487

interesting characters,
spooky atmosphere and scary goings-on.
What's not to like.
This is a very nice murder mystery.
I'll watch it again.
I'm glad that I have it.",1242259200,3,200,5.090909090909091
7837330,4,6303102956,"I won't go into the whole plot of this movie but I will say that there is a twist at the end.

If you grew up with Curtis's other classic flicks such as The Night Stalker, The Night Strangler, and The Norliss Tapes, then you'll appreciate the job he's done on this film. A bonus I didn't even know about until I saw the opening credits was Richard Matheson did the teleplay for this made-for-TV movie.

But I have to agree with the other reviewers that the video quality is pretty weak. A fair amount of grain and other digital artifacts can be found throughout the film. Not enough to get on a person's nerves, though. But, at least Brentwood/BCI released this classic on DVD.

Here's a tip: Don't buy the more expensive title above with the wolf on the cover. Buy Brentwood's ""Beasts of Terror"" package which gives you four movies for under ten dollars! You get ""Scream of the Wolf"" included plus some other interesting horror films. Makes sense. Right?

Thumbs up! I only wish they'd pull out all the stops one day and release a comprehensive package covering Dan Curtis's horror films. Maybe one day while I'm still around. ;-)",1190073600,9,1131,4.556650246305419
