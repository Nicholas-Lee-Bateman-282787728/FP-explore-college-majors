If you have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or Wrist Pain from ANY cause, you OWE it to yourself to get this DVD. The series of super simple and VERY effective exercises will get you out of wrist pain- fast. The author states in as little as a week.

In over 14 years of nursing, I've never seen even ONE of these exercises recommended for patients with wrist pain- it's too bad too, because these exercises are so EASY and EFFECTIVE.

If you or anyone you know has wrist pain, you should have this in your ""get out of pain toolkit"" for sure.",1228435200,3,785,5.635593220338983
