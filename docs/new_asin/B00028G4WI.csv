8023753,2,B00028G4WI,No closed captions. Not well organized. Repeated clips of the same violent scenes from chapter to chapter. No clear chapter definitions.,1523750400,,136,5.523809523809524
8023754,5,B00028G4WI,"This is a thorough ""deep dive"" into the origin of the Olympic games.  It does not deal with the mythological background (i.e.:  the role of the fellow known as Pelops) but it does engage with the historical / recorded Olympics, beginning with 776BC.  It also offers similarities & contrasts with the modern games, including interviews with current & former Olympic athletes.  For people who are curious about the history of the games, this is a worthwhile documentary.",1521849600,,468,5.038961038961039
8023755,5,B00028G4WI,"I am a teacher, and this DVD is excellent. It is really the most accurate depiction and explanation of the Ancient Greek games, and features professors who have written the best books on the topic. That said, the actors who play the athletes roles are almost nude. This is not appropriate for K - 12. Also, much of it can be found on YouTube.",1519084800,,342,4.359375

8023757,5,B00028G4WI,I really enjoyed this movie.  I had seen an older version in black and white several years ago and wondered if this version would be as good.  It was very good.  The first American Olympians did us proud and the part about how our national anthem came to be is a great bonus.  The movie mixed humor with fact and was fun to watch. This is an entertaining history lesson for all ages.,1432771200,2,383,4.205479452054795

8023759,4,B00028G4WI,"I bought The Real Olympics and The First Olympics. Both cover the same subject with slightly differing information.
The Real Olympics does great camera work with athletic men, wow! The historical review is equally intriguing. No full nudity iin this video even though they say the original olympics were all nude. We will have to wait for that.",1188518400,10,344,4.948275862068965
