2948800,4,B000VSDNG4,"This DVD set has already been released in Mexico.  Although there are four DVDs you will not get the whole set of episodes that were shown on TV. They are edited and a lot is missing, especially toward the middle and end. The main story is there, but you might have to look up an episode guide on the internet to make sense out of some of the plot. Otherwise there will be some very strange jumps in the story.  Other than that, this is a great series with excellent acting and a lot of it is laugh-out-loud funny, so you will probably enjoy it even when the plot seems a little incoherent.",1201392000,26,590,4.212389380530974

2948838,4,B000VSDNG4,"Update: August 3rd 2015
Just wanted to update my review to say that the full 300 episodes are now available on netflix with spanish and english subtitles available.  happy watching.

I should start by saying that I watched all 300 episodes of this show on Hulu and absolutely love this Telenovela.  If they sold a DVD with all of the episodes I'd give it close to 5 stars (a little less than 5 for the last 50 episodes, but that's a different discussion).  There are no english subitles on Hulu, but if you understand some spanish I'd advise you to turn on the closed captioning and give it a whirl.
So why not 5 stars here?  While the full show is a wonderful comedy that had me laughing out loud quite often, editing it down to size unfortunately removed much of the humor that I loved.
I still decided to give it 4 stars after going back and forth on whether to give it 3 stars.  While the full show is better than the edit, I can appreciate the fact that you're going to have to cut some good scenes in order to get it down to the size they needed.  Also if you haven't actually seen the full show and don't know what you are missing, I think you do still get a pretty good story here.  I won't say much about the translations, because I'm not a native speaker.  If you have seen the full thing, well as another reviewer said you do have a souvenir for $7.99 which I don't think is a bad price.  There's going to be a couple of examples (scene descriptions) in the end of this review for those of you who have seen the full show and are wondering about the edits.  I'm putting it in here beacuse it's the kind of thing I would have liked to have known before my purchase.  So don't read further if you don't want spoilers.

There will be a lot missing.  These are two of my favorite scenes below and I wasn't happy with the treatment of either of them.  But I'd have to say I was much more satisfied with the first for obvious reasons.
The Meson restaurant scene is cut pretty much in half.  (Starts with him coming back after discovering She called Tomas on his phone). Which is odd cause he says he knows he treated her bad inside, but I think they cut out most if not all of him treating her bad.  LOL. So of course we miss all the colorful women coming onto him in the restaurant, while Lety downs vodkas, and she introduces herself (loudly) to all the people he refuses to introduce her to. But you do get the Awesome dramatic scene outside.
The bar scene in acapulco which I think was probably 30 minutes long at least is cut down to less than 3 minutes.  So we don't get to see don fernando continuously and humourously entering and getting kicked out of the bar as he tries to provoke the guys that beat him up. No multiple names for the short bartender (Lilliput LOL) and no whispering to the bartender that he's going to drop off Marcia in Mexico city and come back.  He basically walks in there jumps on the bar and calls the guys chickens, dives into them, they beat him up, then Marcia's there and on to the next scene.

Like I said much of the humorous parts of this show that I love are cut out.  But I still have some great scenes to look back on ie the Meson scene above. So hope this review helps someone.",1429920000,,3227,4.2061688311688314

2948891,4,B000VSDNG4,"La fea ms bella (The Most Beautiful Ugly Girl  590 minutes)

We are talking about an uncommonly unattractive young woman who is uncommonly smart. Lety (Anglica Vale) keeps trying to get a job but is consistently bumped by buxom blondes. Our gal has braces on her teeth, bad hair, a unibrow, a terrible fashion sense, ugly glasses and poor posture.

Through a fluke that discloses how bright she is, she gets a job at an ad agency but is stuck in a back room so clients won't see her. With her post-graduate degrees and excellent education, our homely heroine quickly becomes indispensable. The two most handsome men (Juan Soler and Jaime Camil) fall for her because she is so different. She ends up owning the company and loving both men; she just can't make up her mind.

The most consistent comic relief is an odd couple that consists of a brainy but homely man (Luis Manuel vila) and a very, very buxom blonde (Patricia Navidad). We also enjoy the world's worst spy. His cell phone goes off regularly.... This is laugh-out-loud funny at times but is a bit too cartoony. Which I can forgive because it really IS fun.",1407542400,3,1118,4.603015075376884

2948911,5,B000VSDNG4,"I'm a Spanish teacher in a Title I school and was having a rough time trying to engage my students and keep them on task. I tried various activities, games, and projects, but it was still very difficult. I had to reflect big time on what I thought they were interested in so that Spanish class wouldn't be boring to them. I finally figured it out. DRAMA, haha. They love drama. So, I researched the best telenovelas that would give them just that. Even though there are a few risque scenes in ""La Fea Mas Bella"" (I fast-forwarded them even though they begged me not to/no more than five-ish), my classes loved it. They were always excited to come to class when we were watching the novela and it was a great incentive for them to participate and do all of their work. I typed up questions for them to answer afterwards, and voila!

It is true, the editing isn't the greatest, but these DVD's worked out great for telling the overall story. I have never watched the novela before and it all felt complete to me!  Such a great choice for Spanish High School classes. I wish I knew more novelas that would be appropriate for teenagers.",1370476800,,1132,4.4375

I can recall only FF 3 scenes. 1) Lety is dreaming of Fernando-both in a swimming pool, very little back side nudity. 2) Fernando takes Lety to a hotel room for her birthy-heavy petting, inuendo of sex. 3) the sexy secretary and the nerdy guy go back to HER place after their first date and consumate their relationship...only an inuendo but, they are under the covers. after you get through that you will not need to FF any more! Students, especially non-native speakers, really get into this novela! We had a wedding fiesta for the last episode.

2948918,3,B000VSDNG4,"I was so excited to have found this DVD set available on Amazon.  I loved the telenovela when it was broadcasted on Univision.  I do agree with those who say that the editing is just to be expected- I know it would be difficult and probably even a financial loss for the developers to put the entire series out on DVD unless they separated it into seasons somehow like most of our American TV shows do.  However, I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the DVDs.  While what I did get to see of the show with this set was worth the money I paid, there are parts I know I have not yet seen due to the constant freezing and skipping.  My DVD #1 indicates two sides, yet both have the exact same content on them (the content that is supposed to be only on side two), so I have missed out on the entire first part of the series.  The 2nd and 3rd DVDs have some sort of stain on them that looks like a water stain... they are the ones that skip and freeze the most, oftentimes to the point of no recovery unless I give them a rest for a few hours.  The 4th DVD worked the first few times I put it into a DVD player, but each successive time works less and less well.  This last time (this afternoon) I tried to watch it, it froze in the last ten minutes of the entire series and has not worked in any DVD player since (I have tried three).  I guess I just won't get to see the end.  So, if you want to spend the money just to relive as much as you can of this wonderful telenovela like I did, it is worth it.

This DVD cuts out a lot! This was a long series, but I was drawn into the story of Leticia Padillia Solis and Don Fernando.  Despite the editing it is a totally engaging, engrossing story! Lety becomes a complete woman with humor, understanding, and self-introspection, she isn't demeaned or fooled, and she gets a man who appreciates how smart, fun, kind, and wise she is.

There are many travails Lety overcomes with the help of her true friends and Tomas, her best guy pal (equally feo) helps her run her own highly successful business and save the day, despite the cunning and drama of HIS love: Alicia, a beautiful bombshell.

OH THE DRAMA! Remember to stop the DVD to eat and work or you could starve and find yourself without a job (I am speaking from personal experience).

I really enjoyed La Fea Mas Bella on DVD, despite the fact that I haven't seen any other versions of Betty La Fea, I thought this Mexican version is pretty good, with no other background I was able to follow the storyline. I'm sure you can not compare it to the original version, but I think the DVD version is good enough.",1208822400,3,484,4.21505376344086
2948948,1,B000VSDNG4,"I'm seriously upset with the DVD set, many of the already posted reviews match everything I would say... so I'm only going to post what happened when I emailed the CEO of Xenon Pictures.... This does not make up for anything maybe if more fans emailed Xenon and complained something better might come out of it.

""Hi Cynthia. I'm sorry you were disappointed with the dvd version of La Fea Mas Bella.

As you are aware, the original telecast versions of La Fea and other telenovelas are often up to 300 hours in length.  If we were to release an unedited version of any particular show, we'd be asking consumers to pay $150 per telenovela given the fact that it would be a 25-30 disc set. We tested a full length version of Amor Real (the most popular telenovela of its time) and no one wanted it at that price. Another difficult issue is music clearance costs which makes a full length version too expensive to produce.

In terms of what you saw in the final product of La Fea Mas Bella, that version was directly overseen by the producers of the show. It is always a challenge to consolidate a version of a telenovela to 10-12 hours and inevitably some material that consumers love will get cut.

I don't know that this will satisfy you. But I did want to take the time to let you know the issues at play.

Best regards,
Leigh Savidge""",1208476800,24,1336,4.4105691056910565

They chopped that part up so bad that if you didn't see it on TV you would not know where some of the caracters came from.

The shame of it is that they had 4 DVD...1,2,3 were on both sides but they had the 4th with only one side.  They could have had at least 2 hours more and not chopped the end so much.

Still it is worth watching.  All the actors were absolutely great.  i was a big fan of Jose Jose CD and seeing he is still well after his illness was also a plus.

2948968,3,B000VSDNG4,"Wow. Don't buy this unless you've already seen most of series, especially towards the end. That way, your memory can fill in the large gaps left behind by merciless editing. Otherwise, I don't think this DVD set is going to make much sense to you.

When I heard this set was going to be less than 20 hours, I got worried. The actual series was about 300 hours long, minus commercials. Even though that included a lot of filler material I knew I'd never miss, I didn't think there was any way to get it down to 20 hours without losing some important plot points.

Well, maybe there is a way to do it, but this DVD set isn't it. The runtime is 15 hours, 24 minutes, which means (predictably) that there's a lot of stuff missing.

The packaging is very cheesy - inside the box, there's just one small sheet of paper (printed on only one side) that lists the chapter breaks for the main program. If you want to know where the extras are, you need to hunt around the disks for them. (You may or may not feel afterwards that it was worth the trouble.) Not that they are hard to find, but it would have been nice to have this information printed somewhere.

The four disks (three of which are two-sided, so handle them VERY carefully) are crammed together into the case such that you might be nervous about breaking disk 2 when trying to remove disk 3, or vice versa. I'm going to throw away that case and repackage the disks in user-friendly  boxes.

Despite these complaints, it's not a stinker at all. Most English-speaking fans will appreciate the English captioning. And it's nice to have a licensed, legal copy of some portion of LFMB, even if it's not all that I had hoped. Anyway, for the price - come on, seven DVD sides - it's really not bad. Try to look at it as a souvenir of LFMB, rather than as a way to relive the experience. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing!",1203897600,46,1868,4.353448275862069

The worst part is in how they removed the scenes of some of the most important supporting characters that directly effected why Letty and Fernando had to overcome so many obtacles. They completely lost the beauty of this love story that encompassed so many other relationships that impacted Letty and Fernando. By the fourth DVD the content is so bad, you feel cheated and the amount of money paid isn't worth it.  If they were trying to save money they really sacaraficed the quality of this novela, and made the two main characters appear silly and without subtance.

3183335,4,B000VSDNG4,"Update: August 3rd 2015
Just wanted to update my review to say that the full 300 episodes are now available on netflix with spanish and english subtitles available.  happy watching.

I should start by saying that I watched all 300 episodes of this show on Hulu and absolutely love this Telenovela.  If they sold a DVD with all of the episodes I'd give it close to 5 stars (a little less than 5 for the last 50 episodes, but that's a different discussion).  There are no english subitles on Hulu, but if you understand some spanish I'd advise you to turn on the closed captioning and give it a whirl.
So why not 5 stars here?  While the full show is a wonderful comedy that had me laughing out loud quite often, editing it down to size unfortunately removed much of the humor that I loved.
I still decided to give it 4 stars after going back and forth on whether to give it 3 stars.  While the full show is better than the edit, I can appreciate the fact that you're going to have to cut some good scenes in order to get it down to the size they needed.  Also if you haven't actually seen the full show and don't know what you are missing, I think you do still get a pretty good story here.  I won't say much about the translations, because I'm not a native speaker.  If you have seen the full thing, well as another reviewer said you do have a souvenir for $7.99 which I don't think is a bad price.  There's going to be a couple of examples (scene descriptions) in the end of this review for those of you who have seen the full show and are wondering about the edits.  I'm putting it in here beacuse it's the kind of thing I would have liked to have known before my purchase.  So don't read further if you don't want spoilers.

There will be a lot missing.  These are two of my favorite scenes below and I wasn't happy with the treatment of either of them.  But I'd have to say I was much more satisfied with the first for obvious reasons.
The Meson restaurant scene is cut pretty much in half.  (Starts with him coming back after discovering She called Tomas on his phone). Which is odd cause he says he knows he treated her bad inside, but I think they cut out most if not all of him treating her bad.  LOL. So of course we miss all the colorful women coming onto him in the restaurant, while Lety downs vodkas, and she introduces herself (loudly) to all the people he refuses to introduce her to. But you do get the Awesome dramatic scene outside.
The bar scene in acapulco which I think was probably 30 minutes long at least is cut down to less than 3 minutes.  So we don't get to see don fernando continuously and humourously entering and getting kicked out of the bar as he tries to provoke the guys that beat him up. No multiple names for the short bartender (Lilliput LOL) and no whispering to the bartender that he's going to drop off Marcia in Mexico city and come back.  He basically walks in there jumps on the bar and calls the guys chickens, dives into them, they beat him up, then Marcia's there and on to the next scene.

Like I said much of the humorous parts of this show that I love are cut out.  But I still have some great scenes to look back on ie the Meson scene above. So hope this review helps someone.",1429920000,,3227,4.2061688311688314

My DVD #1 indicates two sides, yet both have the exact same content on them (the content that is supposed to be only on side two), so I have missed out on the entire first part of the series.  The 2nd and 3rd DVDs have some sort of stain on them that looks like a water stain... they are the ones that skip and freeze the most, oftentimes to the point of no recovery unless I give them a rest for a few hours.  The 4th DVD worked the first few times I put it into a DVD player, but each successive time works less and less well.  This last time (this afternoon) I tried to watch it, it froze in the last ten minutes of the entire series and has not worked in any DVD player since (I have tried three).  I guess I just won't get to see the end.  So, if you want to spend the money just to relive as much as you can of this wonderful telenovela like I did, it is worth it.

3183418,5,B000VSDNG4,I have noted that several people have had trouble with playback of the discs. May be a data rate issue more than the discs themselves. They seem to be quite hi-res for the amount of runtime on each disc. I sometimes have to burn discs on my job & have seen similar problems when I set the data rate too high. I had good luck with software playback on a good PC after having trouble with playback on a regular DVD player. I used VLC Media Player which should still be available as a free download on CNET.

3183423,5,B000VSDNG4,"Lety is a brilliant, kind-hearted, compassionate, empathetic, savvy, professional who has been hurt in the past and is trying to work her way up to business success despite being ""una fea"" an ugly girl with a good heart, a loving family, loyal friends, and a CUTE boss.

This DVD cuts out a lot! This was a long series, but I was drawn into the story of Leticia Padillia Solis and Don Fernando.  Despite the editing it is a totally engaging, engrossing story! Lety becomes a complete woman with humor, understanding, and self-introspection, she isn't demeaned or fooled, and she gets a man who appreciates how smart, fun, kind, and wise she is.

There are many travails Lety overcomes with the help of her true friends and Tomas, her best guy pal (equally feo) helps her run her own highly successful business and save the day, despite the cunning and drama of HIS love: Alicia, a beautiful bombshell.

OH THE DRAMA! Remember to stop the DVD to eat and work or you could starve and find yourself without a job (I am speaking from personal experience). If you speak Spanish and English well you might disagree with some of the subtitling, but overall it not a major issue.  This is my second time buying this DVD, I wore the first one out.

This does not make up for anything maybe if more fans emailed Xenon and complained something better might come out of it.

""Hi Cynthia. I'm sorry you were disappointed with the dvd version of La Fea Mas Bella.

As you are aware, the original telecast versions of La Fea and other telenovelas are often up to 300 hours in length.  If we were to release an unedited version of any particular show, we'd be asking consumers to pay $150 per telenovela given the fact that it would be a 25-30 disc set. We tested a full length version of Amor Real (the most popular telenovela of its time) and no one wanted it at that price. Another difficult issue is music clearance costs which makes a full length version too expensive to produce.

In terms of what you saw in the final product of La Fea Mas Bella, that version was directly overseen by the producers of the show. It is always a challenge to consolidate a version of a telenovela to 10-12 hours and inevitably some material that consumers love will get cut.

I don't know that this will satisfy you. But I did want to take the time to let you know the issues at play.

Best regards,
Leigh Savidge""",1208476800,24,1336,4.4105691056910565

I was kind of disappointed in the part I did see (the end of it when she became Aura).  They chopped that part up so bad that if you didn't see it on TV you would not know where some of the caracters came from.

The shame of it is that they had 4 DVD...1,2,3 were on both sides but they had the 4th with only one side.  They could have had at least 2 hours more and not chopped the end so much.

Still it is worth watching.  All the actors were absolutely great.  i was a big fan of Jose Jose CD and seeing he is still well after his illness was also a plus.

3183465,3,B000VSDNG4,"Wow. Don't buy this unless you've already seen most of series, especially towards the end. That way, your memory can fill in the large gaps left behind by merciless editing. Otherwise, I don't think this DVD set is going to make much sense to you.

When I heard this set was going to be less than 20 hours, I got worried. The actual series was about 300 hours long, minus commercials. Even though that included a lot of filler material I knew I'd never miss, I didn't think there was any way to get it down to 20 hours without losing some important plot points.

Well, maybe there is a way to do it, but this DVD set isn't it. The runtime is 15 hours, 24 minutes, which means (predictably) that there's a lot of stuff missing.

The packaging is very cheesy - inside the box, there's just one small sheet of paper (printed on only one side) that lists the chapter breaks for the main program. If you want to know where the extras are, you need to hunt around the disks for them. (You may or may not feel afterwards that it was worth the trouble.) Not that they are hard to find, but it would have been nice to have this information printed somewhere.

The four disks (three of which are two-sided, so handle them VERY carefully) are crammed together into the case such that you might be nervous about breaking disk 2 when trying to remove disk 3, or vice versa. I'm going to throw away that case and repackage the disks in user-friendly  boxes.

Despite these complaints, it's not a stinker at all. Most English-speaking fans will appreciate the English captioning. And it's nice to have a licensed, legal copy of some portion of LFMB, even if it's not all that I had hoped. Anyway, for the price - come on, seven DVD sides - it's really not bad. Try to look at it as a souvenir of LFMB, rather than as a way to relive the experience. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing!",1203897600,46,1868,4.353448275862069

Too much of the important content was cut, the story is hard to follow because they removed too much in trying to keep the focus on only Fernando and Letty.  The worst part is in how they removed the scenes of some of the most important supporting characters that directly effected why Letty and Fernando had to overcome so many obtacles. They completely lost the beauty of this love story that encompassed so many other relationships that impacted Letty and Fernando. By the fourth DVD the content is so bad, you feel cheated and the amount of money paid isn't worth it.  If they were trying to save money they really sacaraficed the quality of this novela, and made the two main characters appear silly and without subtance.
