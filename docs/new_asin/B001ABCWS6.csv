3446524,4,B001ABCWS6,"I just watched this today, and it was so much more than I had expected.  I was expecting some light information on going raw vegan, plus a few recipes.  But this was so much more.  It even has an impressive ""Photo Gallery"" section that introduces each person featured in the video, their photo, and a description of their raw vegan story.  I followed the suggested order viewing the selections of short videos, and in th end, I must say my conviction to stay raw has never been firmer.  This DVD gave me inspiration in ""why"" as well as very quick and easy recipes that look delicious and perfect for me who don't like to spend a long time in the kitchen preparing my meals. It also expanded my horizon on the profound benefits of being raw vegan, not just physically, but mentally and spiritually, that I did not expect, but I must say I appreciate very much, as it is pure fuel and power for strengthening my conviction for raw vegan for life, not only that, it unexpectedly helps me to tune-in to the changes my body, mind and spirit are experiencing, and helping me become more aware of these restored natural innate abilities of my body, mind and spirit, which will further make me more ""alive"" as I become more aware.  Before this DVD, I was just stoked about all the improvement in my weight and health and complexion.  But now after I watched this DVD, I am now able to make the connection between all these benefits with the mental clarity and spiritual wellbeing, and become more aware of how my body, mind and spirit are so much more than I had ever perceived.  Thank you! I'm excited to live my raw vegan life with my new opened awareness, and discover all the wonders that I would not have been aware to if not helped make the connection by this DVD! Get it! Watch it! Become more aware, alive and powerful!",1309996800,8,1819,4.441441441441442
3446525,4,B001ABCWS6,"It was good, not great.  Had some good info, but not nearly proportionate to the cost.  Has some really good points of view, and information, and interviews.",1294704000,,157,4.777777777777778
3446526,3,B001ABCWS6,"As a new convert to raw-food, I was hoping this ""Encyclopedia"" would be something I could share with others or that it would at least inspire and inform me.

The graphics at the beginning and the clarity of the host make you think that it will be really good, but the high quality ends there.  I'm no film critic, but I would guess that whoever was in charge of filming the interviews and editing the results must have been at the very beginning of the learning curve.  Most of the interviewed experts come across as undynamic and rumpled.  It was difficult to listen to them because ninety percent of the time there was incongruous music playing while they were talking and I was also distracted by wondering what was going on with their appearance.  (Word of advice to anyone wanting to get a message across:  Don't distract your audience by being unkempt or unnecessarily wierd-looking.)

I don't know anyone with whom I would be comfortable sharing this DVD.  It's like a first draft that needs lots of editing and do-overs.  I completely support the effort and the message but I wish they would re-do it with higher standards and in a way that will speak to a wider audience, e.g. more clearly stated facts and not so much hodge-podge interviewing.  It just seemed so thrown together and unprofessional that it was hard to watch.

Bottom line:  I love the concept and the people in the film are great but all is  short-changed by some lack of skill in the film-making process.",1290211200,16,1481,4.628352490421456
3446527,3,B001ABCWS6,Good overview how to start and what are the benefits of eating raw. It is mostly a collection of motivational interviews. I expected the subject approached rather scientifically with some practical suggestions and recipes.,1284163200,2,222,5.5588235294117645
3446528,4,B001ABCWS6,This dvd was very informative and entertaining. I enjoyed it and learned some new things. It also came shortly after I ordered it. I was actually surprised at how swiftly it came.,1255392000,2,179,4.625
3446529,3,B001ABCWS6,"This is a good introduction to the Raw Food lifestyle with benefits and recipes and such which make it somewhat inspiring and accessible.
To be honest, the cover is so well done that the actual movie can't compete, but it is a down to earth beginner feature which can help get someone started.
the recipes are great, and my son of 6 actually watches them over and over and cites things from the movie.  This of all has been the most inspiring, because I would never make him watch it, because it's my journey that I'm choosing, but he wanted to and continues to choose to be positively influenced by it.  I do wish that the movie included get started facts, like things you'll need, etc. But if you are just beginning and want a little eye food boost or you want your whole family to be in on this change in your lifestyle, or you're curious about the Raw food lifestyle this is good movie to start that process.  But don't stop here.  Get books and CDs to keep you interested and supported.",1243900800,16,991,4.369565217391305
3446530,5,B001ABCWS6,This was very informative and really made me want to do more research with this way of life. Very helpful in showing you how to do it. I really like this video and it has changed my life forever.,1231632000,10,195,4.0256410256410255
3446531,5,B001ABCWS6,"This is great DVD for those new to raw. This DVD is a companion to Simply Raw: Reversing Diabetes in 30 Days by Woody Harrelson, Anthony Robbins, and Reverend Michael Beckwith.

To Karen Kessler who rated this only 2 stars, I'd suggest that next time to read the description before purchasing a product. The 30 days raw DVD you were looking for is called Supercharge Me by Jenna Norwood.",1227657600,8,387,4.608695652173913
3446532,2,B001ABCWS6,"I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WAS THE MOVIE RAW FOR 30 DAYS, SORTA A REVIRSE OF THE MOVIE SUPER SIZE ME WHICH WAS FANTASTIC. I WATCHED THIS AND IT WAS SEVERAL WELL KNOWN PEOPLE TELLING YOU ABOUT GOING RAW, I HAVE READ SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT AND THIS DVD HAD NOTHING NEW IN IT. I WOULD SAVE MY MONEY $29 AND GO ON LINE OR YOU TUBE AND PULL UP DAVID WOLF, YOU TUBE HAS DOZENS OF RAW INFORMATION",1219449600,25,394,3.9375
3446533,5,B001ABCWS6,"This is not really the ""Ultimate Encyclopedia"" of raw, however, this DVD set is a great introduction to raw, with testamonials, recipes, study analysis, spiritual aspects, and more, the set coveres a wide range of raw topics other than the healthy ""it's good for you"" speech.

You get to see several of the most respected vegan/vegetarian/raw authors and experts share their insite and multiple raw cheffs walk you step-by-step through some of their signature pieces.
Recipes include, snacks, deserts, salads, smoothies, and main dishes.

While you will want to flesh out your library as you grow into a raw lifestyle, this makes a great cornerstone and introduction to all things raw, and the expert testamony goes a long way to giving you the support you need when undertaking this strange ""new"" path.",1217203200,40,803,5.075757575757576
8276557,5,B001ABCWS6,Great video on how we should be eating. I've let a couple doctor's watch it. They are big into nutrition.

8276564,5,B001ABCWS6,"All these cooking shows on TV, they really are nice, but cooking food really destroys the nutritional value of the food I've been eating all my life. The process of packaging food destroys the food I've been eating also. For decades I have been filling the VOID (my stomach) but I have not been eating nutricious food. WE ALL can benifit emensely if we shop at farmers markets or grow our own food. It is a bit more expensive, but so is medical care and treatment for having a bad diet.",1361750400,3,486,4.351648351648351
