8165555,5,B000M06IJ0,"Nice concert by the Ventures at a small venue, in their later years.  Well the DVD is from 2003 so I don't when the show is actually from but the Ventures are in fine form  The crowd is rather dead but the performance is great.  It's fun to watch them play their old classics live, 23 tracks on the DVD.",1516060800,,303,4.016666666666667
