180198,1,1557840873,"I received ""The Gay Ranchero"" as a gift after a relative and I enjoyed watching this classic Roy Rogers film on streaming Netflix. The film showed its age on Netflix, but the print was a reasonably good one. The video image in this DVD from Reel Enterprises is much dirtier, very contrasty and exhibits image weaving. A horizontal tear at about the 15-second mark makes me wonder whether this was transferred from a VHS tape. Even worse, there is an intrusive ""RE"" watermark in the lower right of the frame.",1296345600,6,507,4.644444444444445
180199,4,1557840873,"The Gay Ranchero, 1948 film

The film begins with a rider. The headline says ""Sheriff Rogers Hunts Missing Gold Cargo"". Suspects are rounded up. Two men were hunting, they try to escape by fighting Rogers. Shots are fired. An airplane lands to help Rogers. We see familiar faces at the airport. Roy gets medical help. There is a song from the people riding in the wagon. ""Nacho"" the monkey acts up. ""Look who's here!"" Slim gets paid by his boss. The plane and Sid are gone. Can the airport escape bankruptcy? They fly out gold from the mine, a fast and secure method. Lopez sings a song about Granada. Then there is comedy. We learn about the conspirators who want to own the airport and turn the spa into a gambling casino. They drain out gas and fix the fuel gauge to read full. Sheriff Rogers learns about the airport workers' backgrounds.

The plane runs out of fuel and lands in the meadows, the villains capture the crew. Sheriff Rogers arrives to pursue the robbers. ""They killed Ted."" We hear another song. There is a question about the contents of the gas tank. The bank won't extend their credit - the property will be auctioned off for debts. Consuelo is the high bidder! Sheriff Rogers has a trick up his sleeve. ""Could be."" Will that bull get an injection? There is a dance, then a song by Roy and Betty. Cookie shows his skills, so does Nicky and Roy (or his double). Another gold shipment is announced for tomorrow. What is Breezy doing at night? Bradas has a tricky plan. So does Rogers to catch Bradas and his gang. Cookie is well-armed, the gas tanks are full. Slim returns, there is a fight [for action]. A double-cross? [Sharing the loot is always a problem.]

Rogers and his men wait for the crooks to appear. They do, but realize it's a trap. Can Cookie prevent them from escaping? Monkey see, monkey do? The villains are pursued, Betty saves Roy's life. Trigger knocks on the door! Mike is caught. There is a song for a happy ending. You must imagine the rest of the events.
This film has fuzzy images. It runs longer and has a more complex plot than usual. The story about criminals legally buying a spa to turn it into a gambling casino might have reflected current events.",1281830400,,2198,4.503759398496241
180200,3,1557840873,"This is an unusual Roy Rogers movie for several reasons. The expansion of the meaning of the word ""gay"" over time certainly draws some attention to the film. Needless to say it only meant ""happy etc."" back in the day.

Another unusual factor is the release year of the film. The first time I saw it was back in the early eighities. The newspaper TV section said it was released in 1952. I have a book by Roy and Dale which lists their films and release year that also says 1952. However another book that goes into great detail about the singing cowboys and their movies says it was released in 1948. That makes since because it features Andy Devine who was Roys sidekick in 1947/48, it has Jane Frazee who co stared in several Rogers features in 1947/48 and the copyright year appears to be MCMXLVII(1947).This same book shows it to have been the first RR release of 1948 which fits the time line perfectly as there is usually a gap between the time a movie is filmed and when it is released. Did the film have a limited release in 1948 but had to wait until 1952 for a general release? If so why?

Another interesting point is the movie never seems to show up in color in spite of it being well documented that it was indeed filmed in color. Even the VHS sleeve indicates color but this copy is in black and white. Regrettably I may have to assume that this is one of the RR films that was filmed in color but no color copies managed to survive  the brutal economizing of the early TV film editors.

In summary, this is not a bad Rogers movie and it is in full length certainly a bonus when you consider how many are sold in a cut form. If it was in color it would get one more star. Nevertheless I can recommend the seller, the price and the film.",1273881600,2,1750,4.246246246246246
