7811338,5,6301305116,"This film is very funny and moving at he same time,  A friend of mine was wary of the 133 minute length of the film, but after watching it noted that there was not a single scene that should be cut.  Raimu and Charpin are at their finest.  There are other lesser-known Pagnol original films from the 1930s that are probably as good,but are simply not available anymore (Angele, Joffrio come to mind).  This subtitled version of La Femme Du Boulanger is not available on DVD, which goes to show how easily it may too be lost to future generations.  Modern performances simply do not capture the heart of these Pagnol adaptations of Jean Giono's stories.",1371859200,4,652,4.586206896551724
