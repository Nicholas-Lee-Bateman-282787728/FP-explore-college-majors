8101703,5,B000CSENMG,"Here we have John Anthony West leading a tour of Luxor.  Of course JAW himself is a student of Schwaller de Lubicz and JAWs book Serpent in the Sky is a summary of the symbolist ideas put forth by Schwaller.  So in this episode we get to go to ground zero so to speak and take a tour of Luxor from JAW directly.

There are numerous and adequate diagrams and comparisions with the different parts/areas of the temple as mapped to the human body.  JAW explains the metaphors in play.  He also draws out a number of clues that Schwaller found in the temple that are very helpful in both orienting to the structure and in decoding it.

Overall this is perhaps the best episode overall for the series.  You get JAW the entire time and get lots of solid information.  This is a must see for any aspiring Egyptologist.",1391644800,3,811,4.36
