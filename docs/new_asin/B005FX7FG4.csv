8470795,3,B005FX7FG4,"It was great to see a comprehensive collection such as this. I bought it just after buying the 21 disc region 2 set. It appears to be ""taken"" from the material in that larger set and plays a little funny; lots of digital artifacts. One disc (so far) Disc 4 has two films that cannot be played properly (Below Zero and Blotto).

Descent packaging, labeling.

These are NOT ""commercially"" prodused discs! They are burned.
There is no way to track these back to a manufacturer (""Classic DVD Videos, Inc."") so I guess I'm out of luck as far as getting a replacement disc.",1334016000,,567,4.495145631067961
8470796,5,B005FX7FG4,"This collection isn't very well cleaned up, like the newest collection.  But it has everything you need from the silents, to the shorts, to the full length feature films.  Love it!",1330732800,,180,4.774193548387097
8470797,5,B005FX7FG4,"I had recently recieved the new Essential L&H Collection for Christmas, and this set was the perfect compliment to it as it added all the Hal Roach silents to my collection which were not included in the Essential set. The Platinum Collection was shipped extremely fast and I thought the films were very good quality, especially concidering some of these movies are nearly 85 years old. The low price and high quality as well as the large volume of material make this collection very attractive.  The silents alone are well worth the price, but much more is included. I would highly recommend this set especially for those fans who are just starting to buy these movie and want to get a collection started quickly.",1328918400,2,714,4.758064516129032
8470798,5,B005FX7FG4,"I got this DVD, and was it ever funny. I loved watching these films when they used to air on AMC movie classics. My funniest favorite is ""Them Thar Hills."" and it's sequel ""Tit for Tat"". Of course Way out West was a funny movie, as poor poor Stan had been tickled to bits by Mrs. Lola as she reached into his shirt in an attempt to get the deed. As a special surprise, I was also sent a DVD containing a few episodes of the Little Rascals for free. Another Hal Roach classic. This is going to be watched over and over again.",1328572800,2,524,4.048076923076923
8470799,5,B005FX7FG4,"Laurel And Hardy's filmed archives has been mistreated over the years, and only recently the first remastered Essential Collection has been announced for release in Oct 2011.  Having said that, this Platinum collection is by far the most comprehensive collection available.  It contains a total of 84 classic shorts and full length features, that basically cover the entire Hal Roach era.  You even get their silent shorts, that are not available on the new essential collection.  They made over 100 films together, and the cream of the crop is right here.  The only missing feature of note, is ""March Of The Wooden Soldiers"", which is readily available as a single colorized and B+W disc.  The quality of these Dvd's very good, and at a very affordable price.  Considering the age of these classics, one should not expect a HD picture, but trust me, these movies have decent clarity, and the sound more than adequate, when you take into account some of these features are more than 75 years old.  If you want to own a complete essential library of the Laurel and Hardy filmed archives, this is the one to own, especially if you are on a budget.  Their classic 10 volume set of shorts are selling on the used market for $10-$20 per disc, with only 4 shorts on each disc.  Do the math and it would cost $100 or more just for the shorts.  So as you can see, getting all the silent shorts, and great movies like ""Way Out West"", ""Sons Of The Desert"", ""Pardon Us"", etc, make this the best buy of all Laurel and Hardy collections available.",1318032000,9,1534,4.602941176470588
