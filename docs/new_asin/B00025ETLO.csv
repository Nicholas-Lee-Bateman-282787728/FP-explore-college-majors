8022435,4,B00025ETLO,"""Sky of Love"" isn't exactly what the description on the back of the DVD says it is, but the premise of two people in different decades contacting each other via a radio is correct. Both parties are in relationships. Xiao-jai (Gigi Leung's character who's in the past) is just starting a sweet relationship with a close friend and Wen Tao's (Ken Zhu's character who's in the present) relationship with his girlfriend is falling apart. Right away the characters find out they are in different time periods. Over the days as they talk via the radio they discuss love and what it is. The movie looks at how love was regarded circa 1980 and what people think of it now in the 21st century. The end of the movie is very bittersweet. The movie is not boring (unless you don't like romantic dramas) and the acting is well done. Plus the subtitles are good and the main idea of the movie is easy to understand. I give it four stars.",1141344000,2,923,4.4674556213017755
