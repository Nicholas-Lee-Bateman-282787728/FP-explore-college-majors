8743350,4,B018YGVMMG,I received my first copy while I was out of town. I came home excited to watch it and opened it up to find an empty case. That is the only reason its 4 stars. The rating remains high because I went online and within 2 minutes of reporting it was missing they had a replacment on it way. It was so fast. That earned some star ratings in my book. As long as the next copy is in the case and new as stated. Ill be a happy girl!,1524441600,,424,3.7222222222222223
