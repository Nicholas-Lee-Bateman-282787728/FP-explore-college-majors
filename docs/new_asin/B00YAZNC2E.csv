8718036,4,B00YAZNC2E,"This is under-rated, in my opinion.  Anthologies tend to be under-rated; horror anthologies even more so.  The first story was subtle in its way of making me  feel anxious and wanting to know....what kind of game is this guy's wife up to...?  It's not easy to describe, but it's there.  She seems to be who he knows in some shots, but in other shots, the close-up ones of a smirk that makes her seem unfamiliar and menacing...she is a stranger commanding him to open up.

The second story was unremarkable, a tale about a photographer and what is a killer goblin of some sort.  Forgettable.  I already forgot what the creature was, as it's been a few months ago that I actually watched it.

The third one was startlingly fast-paced, as much science fiction as it was horror.  Downright edge-of-your-seat action.

The middle story and the wrap-around one (a bored and irresponsible babysitter is the teller of these stories and a young boy endures them...why do the creators of anthologies get so lazy about these wrap-around stories) both bring down this anthology.  Still, on the whole, not a bad movie at all.  Four stars!",1491523200,,1124,4.731958762886598

It seems his teddy bear along with himself needs to be scared before sleeping. The babysitter at first says  no but she reluctantly agrees. I hate to start at the negatives but Suzi Lorraine is a beautiful actress and if you are like me knee deep in the indie horror film soup you have a clue at who she is. As a babysitter, she is not convincing and sounds like she is auditioning for porn. I felt after seeing her in Wrath of the Crows roles like this would be in her back window. The first story of this film is called  Dont Open the Door. For everything negative I said earlier about Suzi and the kid, there is nothing negative I can say about the first short. The tale is a clever spin on your traditional horror theme. You have a woman who calls her husband on the phone and instructs him that  under no uncertain terms should you open the door, no matter what. He is like any of us would be, confused as all hell especially when he can see her standing outside on the steps ringing the bell. This short was so clever that it did not give the audience anything. It never explained itself and it really wanted to give the audience something to talk about which it did.

This short showed me that when done right horror is an effective manipulative tool. It can trick you into fearing or being paranoid of anything, even things out of the ordinary. We then go from there back to the babysitter who wants the kid to go to bed and he wants yet another story. So, she tells him story two called Over-Developed. Which leads me to say, who in the hell would tell a child this story to go to bed? You have a photographer who is obsessed with this girl named Sarah who is a beautiful young model. You have someone who views someone as unattainable, but a voice in his head is telling him he could have her. The voice in his head does come to life later as this demonic little creature thing. Over-Developed while it lasted a little longer than the first short, it was such a fun little short that created this acid trip like environment for us to not so much be scared but to think about what is more absurd than this. The short was effectively fun and provided some humor that was dark and made this short such a fun time. So, we are done with this short and that kid and his Teddy are still awake and we have the babysitter having to tell one last story called Time Travelers Knife.

This short involves a barmaid named Amelia who is trying to shut down her pub. Easy enough we assume until she discovers that her friends have hidden in hopes that the four of them can enjoy some private time. During this fun a text message comes across that there is a killer in there with them. Which is revealed as they see a figure in a costume with a mask. To throw more complication into this short we have a time traveling angle involving a watch. This short was confusing but when it came together towards the end, it really showcased that sometimes you have to let things digest. This short I felt would have benefited more from being a little longer and letting the story play out some more. In terms of shorts, it was not bad but it did get so confusing in the middle that you have to hit the pause button just to try and sort it out. This dvd was fun, as far as anthologies go, the genre in indie film companies it is become overly saturated. Where Hollywood is going towards family friendly, sequel, prequel, remake or found footage. It seems indie is going towards anthology, zombie, paranormal or direct rip off without getting a lawsuit for it. Suzi Lorraine is a great actress who in the right film role usually produces more apples than lemons. This film she just seemed like an ornament to give us a name for the cover art. I do not buy her as a babysitter unless Jim Powers is directing the film. The shorts were good for what they were, one and two were fun and smartly done. Number three was a headfuck of ideas and concepts that seemed to not have enough time to really make the desired impact it should have, but it was far from bad or a waste. If you love anthologies, this is a good little one to seek out. If you are not a fan, this will not make you one. There is a lot of talent in this film, and if you are the fan who gets a boner or wettie for this genre, you will dig it.",1449100800,2,4405,4.208284023668639
8718039,1,B00YAZNC2E,"As a rule, I don't rent movies lacking a preview. I need to stick to my rules. This movie was worthless. It was poorly filmed on what I can only guess was a borrowed cell phone. It didn't seem to even try to be scary, focusing instead on endless dialog between bad actors discussing the demise of relationships. I'm not sure even the film makers would have intended it to be categorized as a horror film. Why?  Well, because each story is about 40 minutes of boring dialog followed by the ""pay off"", which consists of two seconds of ""what!?!""  Don't rent it. Don't even watch it for free.",1448928000,3,588,4.385321100917431
