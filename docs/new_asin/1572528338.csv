189964,3,1572528338,"What was so hyped-up to be a very erotic and controversial film to see ended in a complete mockery of the very essence of respect of the human sexuality. In the realm of the senses proved to be more than just a porn flick but doesnt much touch the grounds of what what pure erotica is. What it shows is pure blashpemy of what it is trying to convey. Though I could honestly say that it was well-acted, its content still falls. I think one should watch more a film for its narrative content rather than the flawless presentation of just being raw. It just doesnt give the sensation and the over-powering of emotions to the viewer.",944265600,,629,4.384615384615385

It's basically a porno of a psycho Japanese nymphomaniac and the guy who she was obsessed with. There is really no plot, but one sex scene after another. And yes...it is pornographic. It is pretentious and tries to be artistic. Someone should have told the producer of the movie that Japanese men in the 1930's weren't circumcised!",1497052800,,472,4.5

I will say that the reviews/reviewers were NOT honest about this film;and will add that it is my opinion that you can save your money and by-pass this one without missing ANYTHING of any relevance, In closing,I see why it was banned for so many years-and if I had known that before buying it,I would have saved my money..",1496966400,,633,4.364406779661017

190047,1,1572528338,"I was watching it and thinking, well, it's masterfully done, and there's a sense of clarity to the scenes, and then came the scene with the two young children, out of nowhere.

For any person who hasn't seen this movie, here's what happens: The female protagonist is in a room, and there's a little naked girl and boy running around. The adult woman is wearing a kimono. She's playing a game with the kids, and they're laughing and running around in circles. Out of nowhere, the adult woman grabs the young boy by his genitals, hard, and pulls him, at which point he cries out in pain and says, ""That hurts.""

At this point in the film, it's not art any more. It's crime. This is child pornography and child abuse. There's no ""special effects,"" nothing. The woman is literally grabbing this little kid, and he's literally crying out in pain, telling her to stop. And there's a person with a camera filming it, and now there's you, having paid however much money you put into the experience, either to rent or worse to buy, adding some more little profit to this kid's suffering.

I feel tricked into this. You can say I should have gone and read thoroughly about the movie online until I knew absolutely every iota of what was going to happen, but seriously, is there not a line which I can expect films never to cross? I am adamantly opposed to censorship. And I am also adamantly opposed to criminal acts against children being filmed, live action, and posited as art.

So here's my review. If anyone reads this, at least that person has a chance to know there's one scene in there, a literal scene, of a young boy being dragged by his genitals while he yells. So if you go ahead and watch it anyway, the moral and ethical implications of what you've done are on you. But at least you have a choice now.",1441584000,10,1805,4.444108761329305

190064,5,1572528338,"A movie that's extremely painful to be watched. One hour and a half of hard porn. What starts casually is getting more and more horrible, down to the intolerable end.

I already knew Oshima from the other three movies I had watched, so I tried to get a clue. I knew him as a rebel against any values, any taboos, so I thought this was a deconstruction of Japanese cultural traditions, that aesthetic with delicate sexual suggestions, all geisha poetry and so on; no, says Oshima, all these traditions are just bulshit, it's a voyeuristic society, sexually obsessed. Well, it is some symbol like this in the movie - only it's wrong to focus on this path: it's not the main idea.

The movie takes place in the thirties: Japan was living the pleasures of conquering one Asian country after another: a hedonism of war and victories. Was Oshima creating here a symbol for their military drunkenness, leading ultimately to self destruction? Well, maybe - but this interpretation doesn't lead you too far, either; it's just to simple to reduce this movie to history and politics.

Actually the movie narrates a real case that took place in Tokyo in 1936. I found it on the web: Oshima did not add anything. The owner of a hotel started a casual affair with one of the maids. What followed was a period of uninterrupted sex and an ever growing mutual dependence. She was forbidding him to leave even for peeing.

Finally she began strangling him up to a certain point, as this was increasing his pleasure during orgasm. And he asked her to strangle him up to the end. After he died she cut his genitalia, to keep them for ever. As simple as that:)

Oshima just narrated the story, not adding anything, not forgetting anything. Hard porn in real life, hard porn in the movie. Did he want to challenge us? Our stupid conventions, our shameful lies, our two penny principles? Maybe. Still I think the movie is more profound.

Did he want to study the dynamics of an affair that started casually to become madness? To find out the truth about all that love means? Pleasure of sex, pleasure to dominate, pleasure of being dominated? Search for pleasure, search for absolute? Or just to pull out a moral lesson? After all, once common morale considers extramarital sex a sin, there is no more a compass to tell you where to stop once you're in.

How to find a sense in a fact beyond common sense? I think it's much simpler: this movie is just a narration of the fact. Oshima did not make judgments, he just told the story, as it was. A reenactment. Letting aside the common sense and celebrating all the five physical senses. I know it sounds horrible. But a story beyond good and evil deserves just that, a honest narration: which is a celebration. And believe me, this movie is a gorgeous celebration.",1422316800,12,2789,4.599597585513078

190074,3,1572528338,"Of all the categories of film ones depicting open sex are the most controversial. Trick people, steal their identities, wealth or children, make war, drop bombs or annihilate planets and it is all fine. Show two humans have sex for pleasure and millions will revolt. Although few deny that sex is exciting many assert it is not proper or art. In this context, making the audience feel unsettled, uncomfortable and flinch is part of the intention of this film.
Written and directed by Japan's Nagisa shima, 1976's In The Realm Of The Senses (Ai No Korida or `love's/lover's bullfight') clinches the title as a risqu and explicit art film conceived to break taboos. Here is a film with full sexuality, nudity, penetration, S&M and more whose mission, for starters, is to push the boundaries, promote free speech and deconstruct obscenity. It is pornographic, but directed to be the opposite. Given the imagery and subject matter the film could easily be labelled pornography; however, the presence of respectable/mainstream/traditional cast, crew, studio and production values - not to mention anti-pornographic (pink eiga) film techniques - renders it enough of a something else to confuse most and push the boundary well back.

Nagisa shima saw obscenity and censorship as anathema to progress and indeed believed Japan has taken many steps backwards since the days of pleasure quarters, open prostitution in brothels, openness and individuality. His distaste for what he saw as the society's backward march, group-think and suppression of free speech is the driving force behind the feature. Indeed the old geisha who at one point entertains the main characters of this film, when the younger ones ended up refusing to return, proclaims ""that's natural for a woman"" to constantly have sex with a man. Oshima's statement in this regard sheds light on his intent. ""The concept of ""obscenity"" is tested when we dare to look at something that we desire to see but have forbidden ourselves to look at. When we feel that everything has been revealed, ""obscenity"" disappears..."" He needed his powers of articulation because - and not for the first time - he would land in court in Japan defending his art. He would live to tell the tale, but to this day the film is only seen in Japan cut, censored and pixelated.

The film unequivocally depicts one X-rated sexual act and thought after another. On a mission to make ""obscenity disappear"" one sees complete nudity, sex, an extramarital affair, S&M inclusive of pain inflicted with or without foreign objects (Kichizo: ""it hurts but feels good""), exhibitionism, ingestion, prostitution, promiscuity/free sex, exposure of children and sex with the elderly. Having scratched items off its list the viewer is still ill prepared for the mutilation that follows. Such is the conviction of the writer/director and the ensemble around him. The film does not stop there. Caught in its crosshairs are Japan's pre-World War II militarization, Japanese traditional respect for one's seniors and tradition, male dominance in sex and pornography and crucially man's greater sexual appetite compared to a woman's.

Any and all of these concepts would horrify the busybodies that constitute any society anywhere, but even more so in the Japan of 1976 with its induced promotion of group harmony and conformity.
Based on a real story dating back to 1936 In The Realm Of The Senses retells the story of Sada Abe (played by newcomer Eiko Matsuda) who bedded with her master (Kichizo Ishida played by Tatsuya Fuji) with their ending up stealing away from their lives in a Tokyo inn in Nakano while abandoning his wife. Scandal ensues when their indulgence intensifies amidst everything described above and more. The lovers completely give of themselves.

Coincidentally, I had recently watched Akarui Mirai&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bright-Future/dp/B0007GADX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bright Future</a>&nbsp;with Tatsuya Fuji who has had an acting career in Japan before and after this feature. It is worth noting this because In The Realm Of The Senses features a range of established Japanese talent. Anywhere else in the world and this movie would not have attracted any takers. Apparently, many women had come to audition for a cinematic role, which involves full penetration. The same could not be said about the male talent. The director recounts many were worried about their phallus size or being able to perform on camera. Nonetheless, first there is Oshima's wife, the actress Akiko Koyama. She had volunteered to play Sada, although some speculate it was done to spur other actresses. She plays a geisha here. The old geisha is Kanae Kobayashi. She plays her actual real-life age. She was an established actress notable for the Zatoichi films. The old vagabond is Taiji Tonoyama whose over 200 credits include the brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Condition-I-No-Greater-Love/dp/B00000ILES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Condition I - No Greater Love</a>. The innkeeper is played by established actress Aoi Nakajima herself the daughter of Masayuki Mori known for classics of cinema like Ugetsu&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ugetsu-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000BB14I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ugetsu (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;or Rashomon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B001BEK8E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>. The crew was also an established team working in Kyoto on the set of many a Mizoguchi or Kurosawa film.
It is an extraordinarily uninhibited and ground-breaking film. Yet, there are beautiful images of old-style Japanese rooms and decor, traditional outfits, melodies of the shamisen and muted but vivid colours throughout the film which is largely restricted to the indoors. The fox (kitsune) masks of the festival, the kites of the Children's festival and the bird dancer (mimicking the actual bird of earlier) colour the film Japanese further. Nonetheless, these are mere interludes amidst the subversive and often difficult viewing.

Amazingly Oshima had sought out the real-life Sada Abe (Sada meaning 'chaste' in Japanese - although her name and the adjective are different Kanjis) and obtained her permission to film In The Realm Of The Senses. By this time she was ensconced in a Buddhist monastery.

190086,4,1572528338,"I've been hearing about this film for years, and never really paid too much attention to it.  I thought it was just another squishy Euro art film about Asian sensuality, so didn't give it much thought, or a watch.  Then recently I read the full story of Sada Abe and knew I had to watch the movie.  And it was not a disappointment, not in the least.

Pornographic?  That's a matter of taste and appreciation for the work.  I don't see it as such, not even close.  It's packed with explicit sexual content, most definitely, but that does not make it pornographic.

This film's NC-17 rating makes the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NC-17-Henry-and-June/dp/0783230559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NC-17 Henry and June</a>&nbsp;look like children's programming.  From the opening minutes, the sexual activity and depiction of it is absolutely unflinching and direct.  I found that surprisingly refreshing, that the main subject of the movie is actually depicted honestly and clearly, not simulated, not hinted at or hidden.  Guccione (kind of) tried to get there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula/dp/B008X9I6X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula</a>, but didn't get it right.  This film most certainly does.

The sexual content is intimate, tender, cruel, infuriating, brutal, erotic and more, a lot more.  I was reminded of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Real-Young-Girl/dp/B005JH54NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Real Young Girl</a>, but the content here is much more abundant and explicit.

And that ending, with the cutting-off scene.  Really, really bloody and gnarly, quite unpleasant to watch, but I did very much appreciate that it was related completely and honestly, adult content for an adult following and contemplating the story.

In the end, the story develops and it's wonderfully ambiguous if Sada is an insanely jealous lover, or if her man is so stricken by her that he knowingly and willingly completely surrenders to her, solely for her pleasure.  Kind of a reversed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-of-O/dp/1304906493/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story of O</a>, maybe.  As for the interpretations of feminine response to emerging Japanese imperialism, I didn't really see that.

Bottom line: this is serious art-cinema for the serious and mature movie lover.  This film is not about hot and romantic sex for the purposes of setting a mood or arousal.  It is, as the title says, a chronicle of how two people can fall absolutely and completely for one another, so much so that they lose their bearings, morals, ethics and more.",1401408000,11,2734,6.120734908136483

It is degeneration of human life.  The characters' behavior was beneath animals'.  In a word, it is disgusting.  I don't understand why Oshima was praised for creating this kind of movie.  It is a pioneering pornography in disguise of screen art.

  The Japanese culture doesn't have Christian background, so it is understandable that the expression of sex and its decadent indulgence often become excessive and abnormal from the Western standard.  The screen play by actors and actresses in this movie, however, turned to be unnecessarily extreme and pornographic.  The movie is not beautiful and is rather ugly.  It neither depicts normal scenes of modern Japanese life nor expresses typical Japanese psyche.  If Oshima wanted to show ""the realm of the senses"", there would have been a variety of different ways to do so than this one.  The movie preserves some scenes of pre-war Japanese decadent life, but their value is limited.  Some critics defended Oshima by saying that he wanted to show anti-regime sentiment among Japanese commoners with those extreme sexual obsession, but again there has been a variety of different ways to do so whitout descending to that decadence.

190116,3,1572528338,"I can't agree with the reviews that call this ""porn"" or a ""sex movie"".
Pornography is filmed and stylized to incite sexual arousal. Though the sex scenes are graphic, they are not at all stylized to arouse. In fact, they are painful to watch as the characters get caught up in their obsessions with each other. If that was the intent,the film makers achieve this beautifully. I think any viewer that has experienced being in  deep ""lust"" can empathize with the irrational desire to not want to leave that realm of the senses created by really, REALLY, good sex (the title is very appropriate). Inevitably, things fall apart but while one is in the moment, the moment feels like the edge of the world. I think this film drives that message home in very blunt, and quite horrific terms (the scene with the children and the ending are disturbing).

However, I did find myself a bit bored by the characterizations or the lack thereof. I wanted to know more about Sada and her lover. The one scene that sticks out in my mind is when the actors actually have a too brief dialogue about their childhoods. While I didn't find it erotic or the characters very interesting (perhaps I would have felt different if I had seen the other movies about Sada or knew more of the story?), I still think it was worth watching (as an inexpensive rental- not necessarily a buy). The sets,staging, and actors are beautiful. It will definitely give you something to talk about if you are brave enough to watch it with your friends (no prudes- their heads will likely explode even though the sex is not very sexy by adult entertainment standards). Perhaps reading some historical notes on Sada's case before viewing will give the experience more depth.",1342396800,5,1728,4.680921052631579
190117,3,1572528338,"Until now I had never seen this notorious Japanese film from the provocative decade that brought us ""Last Tango In Paris,"" ""Straw Dogs,"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" where sex and violence collide.  Not that those classifications were new, but those were made by critically acclaimed filmmakers.  Having seen those films and many others of the genre, Nagisa Oshima's film stands out.

While it is also violent, the notable characteristic is the sex.  And I'm not talking about simulated sex; I'm talking about real sex...at least between the two primary characters.  Sada Abe is a 20 something servant of her master Kichizo.  To make ends meet, she's also a part time prostitute.  Based on real events in the 1930's, married Kichizo takes up with Sada.  Not as a concubine but as another ""wife."" They can't keep their clothes on or their hands off of each other.  Sada, in particular appears to have true nymphomaniac symptoms.  While perhaps thinking of her lover, she still has sex with other men including a vagrant living on the street and a school principal who is satisfied with just her company.

Sada makes no secret of what she wants and where she wants it.  This leads to sadomasochism and in one dream sequence, borderline pedophilia.  Many critics hail the film as groundbreaking, powerful, impressive and so on.  I will give it credit for being groundbreaking.  It is the most graphic and explicit ""art"" film I've ever seen.  Technically, the film is well made.  The acting is pretty good.  Remembering impressive dialog while engaging in sex can't be easy.  Is this film worthy of great praise?  Well, I don't think so.

These scenes are very very important and the film would not have worked without them. Here is a film where explicit sexual scenes are not an excuse to but necessity. Also, sex has probably never been filmed in such a beautiful way.

The whole film is in fact a fascinating love story. It is based on a true story about what any normal person would call insanity but Nagisa shima manages so well to show us their own logic that the whole thing becomes a mixture of beauty and terror.

This Criterion Blu-ray release gives the film the respect it deserves. It is the first American dvd release to present the film in its original aspect ratio, along with a stunning restoration of the print.

Oshima is a director who rebelled against the main film sensibilities of his time and culture. He looks at and addresses many of the subjects that the Japanese culture refuses to acknowledge because it doesn't fit the norms of their culture. This film, a depiction of a real event, deals with sexual obsession and the consequences of its impact on the couple. The woman became a popular folk hero of sorts at a time when the culture did not acknowledge women as sexual beings. The director presents the event in an explicit graphic manner yet gives the viewer a very detached, perhaps objective, view of the characters. There is no middle ground in this film. Viewers either hate it or in my case, see it as brilliant filmmaking and storytelling.

The explicit depiction of sex in the film has been at the heart of the controversy surrounding this film. Many have called the film pornographic because of it. However, the graphic nature is anything but titillating and only enhances the dysfunction of the obsession.

If you are interested in Oshima's body of work, this may not be the first film to watch as an introduction to him. His most accessible film ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"" might be a better introduction. It too has been given a wonderful treatment and restoration by Criterion.

One final note, the film's topic and portrayal of sexuality is very frank. It certainly shouldn't be seen by children. If you are open-minded and enjoy a cinematic challenge, consider this film a classic.",1290729600,7,1881,4.814241486068111

190132,2,1572528338,"""In the Realm of the Senses"" is a beautifully shot, well-acted film that is incredibly controversial -- and, in my view, incredibly dull. I found it to be a lovely-looking exercise in tedium.

The plot, such as it is, concerns a man and a woman in obsessive lust with each other. They have sex many times. Many times. Many, many times. These scenes are not particularly erotic or titillating; their lovemaking seems compulsive and peculiarly joyless. Anyway, even if a viewer starts out thinking of this film as sexually exciting, the ultra-violent ending (which I won't spoil here) will certainly kill that feeling.

In the liner notes of the rather excellent Blu-ray, Japanese film historian Donald Ritchie very persuasively argues that the film is too artistic to be dismissed as porn. However, he further argues that it is an effective critique of the repressive aspects of Japanese society, and on this point Donald and I must part company. In my view, the film contains far too little historical context or explicitly political content to count as a significant critique of 1930s Japanese militarism (or, for that matter, mid-1970s Japanese society). Sure, the film contains one interesting image of the male protagonist walking in the opposite direction from a column of soldiers -- but one shot does not constitute an entire political argument.

Perhaps the film is more meaningful for Japanese viewers, who can pick up on subtle historical allusions and understand better the restrictive moral standards that the director is attacking. However, as an American viewer, I pretty much missed all of the social commentary. Besides, the main characters are so narcissistic -- and so cruel to other people -- that I fail to see what makes them appealing as ""rebels."" If I had to choose between living like these creepy, obsessive lovers, or living in human society with all its dull restrictions, I think I'd gladly pick society! There is such a thing as rebelling in the wrong way, you know?

Anyway, political mumbo-jumbo aside, my main problems with this movie are that it's very thin on incident and very thin on characterization (we know almost nothing of the protagonists, except that they really, really like each other). I was expecting an art movie with a bit of sex in it, and I ended up with a sex movie with a bit of art in it. Disappointing.",1263254400,13,2357,4.914572864321608

Fans of Tatsuya Fuji's semi-flaccid member need look no further.  Because the movie consists almost entirely of unblinking depictions of sexual acts it can get a little boring.  The only real plot arc is an ever deepening repertoire of kink, and the deliberately claustrophobic atmosphere ultimately wears on you in a bad way.  By the end I wasn't shocked at the characters' transgressiveness so much as annoyed by their irresponsibility.  Breath play can be safe if done properly!  What's the matter with you people, don't you read Dan Savage?

However, a lot of my impatience with the movie was due to the fact that I lacked the cultural context.  Only after I had finished watching it did I read the essay in the booklet the accompanies the disc and learn that ""In the Realm of the Senses"" is based on a real event from 1936 that has entered Japanese folklore and been the subject of other, less explicit, films.  Presumably a Japanese audience would have already been familiar with the basic story, so would have been more likely to find the single-minded fixation on sex to be an interesting retelling rather than disconcerting or dull.  Apparently the movie is also a commentary on the sexual repressiveness and growing authoritarianism of 1930s Japan, though I didn't pick up on that at all.  The one scene of Imperial Army soldiers marching down a narrow street seems disconnected from the rest of the action, and if all you had to go on was this movie, you'd think that pre-war Tokyo was just one big orgy.

As a Japanese cultural artifact, a case study in late-twentieth century obscenity laws, and a representative of a certain affectless style of cinema, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" is interesting, but I can't say that I enjoyed it.",1250035200,8,2417,5.485175202156334

It is amazing how a certain overzealous puritanism (or in this case, a certain high-brow, self-satisfied snottiness) can generate its own kind of excess... It is funny when such know-it-all self-righteousness hastily condemns a work of art, and yet betrays its own blindness by showing how little it has understood what it condemns.

_In the realm of the senses_ is a study in ""beautiful"" excess... But it must be understood that this kind of ""beauty"" is only accessible to a certain poetic sensitivity that is able to perceive it in places where souls with a different kind of sensitivity can only see ugliness or worse, mere redundancy and futility (""1.5 hours of pointless inanity,"" as the previous reviewer puts it).  And yes it depicts on the surface an eroticism that is brutal, excessive, increasingly degenerative, and ultimately all consuming, but like any piece of meaningful art, it resonates beyond itself to invoke a variety of supplementary meanings and insights into human behavior that can only bring riches and rewards to the patient, discerning viewer. More importantly, the film is not out to glorify the pattern of excess it depicts since it places the eroticism on a path of increasing depravity that inexorably leads to self-destruction.  In that sense, the film is implacably moral!  But let's leave that aside...

An incapacity to see beyond the mentioned surface eroticism is in itself nothing incriminating... Evidently, people are entitled to their tastes, and their opinions, and these are bound to show differences...  There are people who, due to their constitutions and tastes, will not last through 10 minutes of the kind of graphic eroticism that is depicted here in all its glory, and that is perfectly understandable since such people cannot help themselves.  But why condemn so vehemently, and with such a despotic and dismissive sense of self-righteousness, a work of art that one obviously understands so little???",1241827200,15,2060,5.1467065868263475
190138,2,1572528338,"The Film:

Man. Where to start. Well, my expectations going in were that it would be a portrayal of pre-War Japanese culture and its taboos, with some explicit sex thrown in. While I certainly got the latter, the former was almost no where to be found.

Apparently, it is a re-telling of an historical event in which a young woman, Sada Abe, engages in an affair with an older, wealthier married man, and eventually kills and castrates him. Well, the affair, a bunch of sex, and the climactic assault are present, but that's about it. There is a 30 second scene with soldiers marching down the street, and that's about it for context. Mostly, it is a terminally boring parade of sex scenes which, while explicit, don't even function to titillate my prurient interests.

Sada fellates and fornicates in various combinations, has sex with a few other men in order to raise money, and they secret themselves away from his wife in resorts and are served wine by geisha. Lather, rinse, and repeat for 1 hour and 42 minutes, and then get the knife out for the ending. The plot, such as it was, was completely and totally uninteresting, not to mention extremely difficult to empathize with or understand the pseudo-human emotions involved. Is this woman a nymphomaniac? Is this man stuck in a suicidally boring marriage? Why are they so enraptured by each other? Is it physical? Spiritual? Some sort of inter-class cross-pollination which adds so much excitement to the coupling that it becomes irresistible? We are left only to speculate as minute after minute of excruciating sex play unfolds.

To be fair, some of the compositions are nice, and some images are beautiful. Frankly, the most interesting image of the film was the couple walking down a riverbank in the rain, their umbrella twirling ahead of them. The amphitheater scene before the finale is well composed, as well.

So I wouldn't call it utterly worthless as a piece of cinema. But 2 or 3 minutes of interesting images surrounded by more than 1.5 hours of pointless inanity doesn't strike me as a worthwhile bargain.

I was glad my PS3 has a function that allows watching films in 1.5x speed while keeping the sound on. This means I saved about 34 minutes of my life for other more important things, such as clipping my toenails, watching paint dry, or playing ""Freecell"" on my laptop. Let me say, though, that I did my level best to watch the film on its own merits and let it breathe. I just appreciate the ability to compress a lost evening once it becomes clear that the merits are too few and far between.

The Blu-Ray:

The video transfer gives us a roughly 16:9 (very slightly pillarboxed on the sides) color image which has much to recommend it. Detail isn't knock your socks off, but it is certainly better than most DVDs, especially of 1970's material. Colors are very deep, especially reds, and black levels, though spotty in some interior scenes, are superb in outdoor scenes.

This is yet another respectful and reference quality Criterion transfer of an older film. Grain is present but not obtrusive, edge enhancement is not noticeable, detail is good, color is spot on. Kudos to Criterion for another job well done.

Extras include some interviews with director and cast, a commentary by a British film historian, some deleted scenes (none of which were interesting or provided the much needed context this film was DYING for), and a trailer.

******

Overall, I give this Blu-Ray 2 stars, mainly for its quality and faithfulness to the material. I  found the film almost completely worthless. I imagine there are some ""cineastes"" out there who will go on and on about how meaningful or profound or erotic this film is. Well, they are in for a treat. This is the best, most faithful presentation of the film I can imagine. Their Blu-Ray dollars will be well spent.

But that doesn't mean you ought to be fooled by their pretension. This film is just plain dumb, terminally boring, completely un-sexy, and frankly pointless. I didn't learn anything about early 20th century Japan, I didn't understand the human condition any better, I hadn't grown as a person from watching this film.

My point in reviewing this is not to denigrate the opinions of others. It's to warn people that they shouldn't dive in blindly because it's by Criterion, who have put out many, many CLASSIC ""art films"" in wonderfully high-quality editions (a few that spring immediately to mind: Spartacus. The Third Man. Seven Samurai. M. The Ice Storm.) Well, this is an art film, sure. But it's also a bad film. Really, laughably bad. I'd hate for someone to buy this based on reputation alone without even considering the various opinions out there (including all of those here) and get turned off to art cinema, or Criterion, altogether. So I write a review, as someone who enjoys film as art, to contribute to the dialogue.

Check out the films of Wong Kar-Wai if you want similar themes with better acting, editing, and writing. Just don't dive in and shell out the money based on reputation alone, or on Criterion's lovely packaging. With feeling: Rent it before you buy it.",1241568000,19,5127,4.782805429864253

This was one of the first films to show full penetration and be left uncut by the film censors and now there are a few out there such as 9 songs, while 9 songs however in spite of its best efforts is just awful this is very different.

190150,3,1572528338,"In the Realm of the Senses (Nagisa Oshima, 1976)

What is the difference between art and pornography? (Thesis: the idea of a fixed definition for the term ""pornography"" depends on an impossibility: a fixed definition for the term ""art."" Discuss.) That's a question you're likely to find yourself asking pretty much constantly while watching In the Realm of the Senses, Nagisa Oshima's infamous 1976 feature that takes the ""Banned in Boston!"" clich&eacute; one better--it really was banned. But, of all places, it was banned in New York. Now that takes some doing.

Based on a true story, In the Realm of the Senses is the story of Sada (Eiko Matsuda), an ex-prostitute who goes to work as a servant in the house of Kichizo (Bright Future's Tatsuya Fuji). Kichizo takes notice of her, and it doesn't take long before that notice becomes something more. Kichizo spirits Sada away to another city, where he sets her up in a different house and carries on life as a bigamist. Sada, however, is the jealous type, and eventually begins to resent Kichizo's other family.

Perhaps the big difference between art and porn is there there's an actual story. (Or the surprisingly small number of close-up shots so common in porn.) And there is one, here, though if you find yourself with a dubbed version, you'll spend half the time you watch it snickering at the silliness of the English voices. (The other half, of course, you will spend happily fapping away and wondering how this movie managed to get out of Japan without those silly blurring effects over the bits you're not allowed to see in Japan.) But pay attention, will you? Obviously, in any film that aspires to be porn, something must be sacrificed, and much of the time, that something is character. And it is true that our main characters here are, perhaps, less well-developed (in the sense of screenwriting, anyway) than we would like. But we know enough about them to enjoy this, and far more than we do about any characters we might have ever run across in a straight porn film. (Or a gay porn film. You know what I mean.)

190151,5,1572528338,"Reviewers are to put it mildly, quite ambivalent about this movie!  Some hate it saying it's 'nothing more than porn', others are puzzled by the seeming paradox of such extremes, of both 'love and aggression' existing in the very same tale, especially since the tale's 'hero' and 'heroine' start out, and remain throughout, till the end, a most unlikely pair to choose as one whose love, initially so playful and innocent looking, will grow into something very different. But really, the concept dramatized by this movie, that passion is a turbulent mix of 'love and aggression', is not new.  And it can be found in many tales of passion throughout history, and today.  These two opposite (but not necessarily opposing if blended right) drives (love/aggression), are to be found, in fact, (as more subtle less extreme forms), in all human activities that passion enters into--i.e. most activities in the 'playground' of being human, in which play park of course, love and sex play starring lead roles! This movie highlights this paradox in such a dramatic way, that we cannot avoid noticing it!  However, to KNOW that this paradox exists, in passion, is quite a potential 'eye opener', and one of the basic truths of being human! And this movie did bring it home.
  Also, for me, the movie was quite believable in its portrayal of the crazy slide from lust and playfulness, and thrill-seeking, at first, to obsession, then addiction. As such, the movie's plot makes total sense.  It followed the classic pattern of evolution seen in many compulsions--from mild, to moderate, and finally, to extreme, of crazy and destructive activity, that is generated by the obsessive's need to CONSTANTLY UP THE ANTE to ever increasingly extreme stimuli, to maintain the same level of thrill!  This pattern, in my view, if accepted by the viewer, makes this movie not at all paradoxical or unbelievable, but a very true and sad classic portrayal of the tragedy of obsession and compulsion.  The movie is worth watching for this alone!  Not to mention, I must say, before the climactic last 30 minutes, I found the sex portrayed as quite hot, loving, and far from cheap robotic stuff that merits the label 'porn'!",1181606400,11,2198,4.932249322493225

If you want to see explicit erotica as entertainment, be honest with yourself and get a Playboy or Penthouse video or whatever. ""Realm"" deserves an X rating but it's gruesome, not arousing, sex.

In this vein, I prefer Peter Greenaway films but why limit yourself to just one director. ""Realm"" isn't as good as The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover, but it's still an engrossing film.

The story of the movie is fascinating in its own right. First, this is officially a French movie. In order to get around Japanese censorship, the film canisters were sent to France undeveloped and the film was released as a French production. It was initially banned in Japan, then a censored version was released with clouds over the shall we say Strategic areas of the image.

The female lead, Eiko Matsuda, disappeared from the art scene. The male lead, Tatsuya Fuji, is still active as an actor and he also took up pottery ten years ago.

190155,4,1572528338,"""For four days, carrying the part she'd severed from his body, Sada wandered through Tokyo.  Those arresting her were astounded that she glowed with happiness.  The story shocked all of Japan.  The compassion of the people made her strangely popular.  These events took place in 1936.""

As described by the final voice over of the narrator, the subject matter of ""In the Realm of the Senses"" is the most lurid true story to come out of Japan in the years before World War II.  On May 18, 1936, a woman named Sada Abe strangled her lover, Kichizo Ishida, during sex at the hotel he owned.  Sada was a maid in the household, having apparently retired from being a prostitute, and began an affair with her master that explored passion and pain during sex.  That he would permit her to erotically asphyxiate him might have been enough to make this story a national sensation, but after Kichizo was dead she amputated his genitals and carried them with her as she wandered the streets of Tokyo for several days before she was arrested.

Nagisa Oshima's 1976 film tells the story of this troubled relationship, although it does not end with Sada's capture, but with her holding her dead lover after she has taken her grisly memento and written ""Sada and Kichi, now one"" in his blood on his chest while we hear the finally narration.  Prior to that the film is about the dynamic of the relationship between Sada and Kichizo, with their sexual relationship explicitly presented as they travel the road to their entwined destiny.  Consequently, I would consider ""In the Realm of the Senses"" to be a dramatic film with explicit sex scenes rather than a pornographic film with strong dramatic elements.  What you think of the film might well depend on whether you consider the sex scenes to be gratuitous or erotic, although certainly there are other reactions.  Simply knowing what you are going to see may be more than enough to dissuade you from seeing the film.

For me the eroticism is tempered by the omnipresent fact that in the end Sada is going to kill Kichizo and amputate his genitals, and there is nothing sexual in the film that is going to make me forget what is going to happen in the end.  Nor is there anything here to suggest that the director is thinking otherwise.  In the climactic scene the camera is shooting from in front of the couple, with the emphasis on his bound hands and her pulling on the scarf around his neck to cut off his air, and not on where their bodies are joined.  Their sexual pathology is displayed and not explained, but I do not think Oshima can be faulted for failing to explain the unexplainable.  We see how their sexual activity moves in inexorably in its fatal direction, and how the willingness to go beyond all the way becomes part of their attraction to each other.  Ultimately the question is not whether the film is sexual, but whether the true story it tells feels real, and by that standard I think it succeeds.

The movie is currently rated NC-17, but was obviously first rated X by the MPAA.  Oshima was unable to finish the film in Japan because of censorship laws, which is why the production is officially listed as being French and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for both processing and editing.  In Japan the sexual activity has been optically censored ever since the 1976 premier.  The United States and the Netherlands are some of the only countries where the film has been available in completely uncut editions.

Sada was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison, but her sentence was commuted in 1940.  Assuming an alias she married, but her husband divorced her when he discovered her identity.  She then became an actress, actually portraying herself in several productions about the infamous incident, but after 1970 she dropped from sight and her final fate remains unknown.  In addition to ""In the Realm of the Senses,"" the story has been told cinematically in ""A Woman Called Sada Abe"" (1975) and ""Sada"" (1998).  However, this version is far and away the most notorious, and for good reason.  For many people simply hearing her story is enough and they will have no desire to see it depicted cinematically.

Some people call this a beautiful love story but I call it the slow descent into insanity by both of the couple.

Critics may dispute just where artistic license crosses into outright pornography, but the sincerity and realism of the protagonists' performance remain provocative, refreshing, convincing.

This film is obviously one of them. The astonishing lust and chilling visual realism will shock you from the first shots. The excesses of the passion had never been shown with such dazzling nakedness ever before.

The other seven films to my mind, would be: Alain Resnais Night and frog, Pasolini `s Salo, Fassbinder 's Querelle,  Marco Ferreri `s  Le grand bouffe,  Ichikawa `s Fire on the plains, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence and Cavani 's La pelle",1132444800,2,785,5.054263565891473

When i got to the end i read that this was a true story and i had no choice but to start watching it all over again.

I don't like messing up anyones day by giving away anything in a movie so i'll describe it as a very simple story about a middle-aged married man and a young woman servant of his who just clik toghether and have lots of sex and go completley insane. Well, that is, insane to us, the ""moral majority"".  The more they connect by having sex the deeper they dive into a hole of passion and pleasure and reality is just not part of their world anymore.
 But to them life is good and all is well as long as they're toghether and in bed.

  The phrase one man's meat is another man's poison comes to mind. And that's the way life is. Every head is a diferent world.

Most of us will never be as ""insaneley"" happy with someone else as they were together (and in this case thats a good thing) so in a way i kinda envy the happynes and comfortness they felt with each other. They did love and care about each other so i can't help thinking that maybe they might have been high on something....Like LSD?

It's as transparent as an old 1960's TV show....its as if you can just hear someone off screen teling them, ""pull her hair"", ""now rub her crotch"", ""jump on top of her"" etc. etc.

My full-screen version (which hers isn't) I paid money for looked like somebody hid in the theatre and filmed it with a camcorder. Her free version she got from a magazine is NOT full-screen and has outstanding picture quality. So obviously there must be a better, digitally cleaned-up version out there.

190190,4,1572528338,"Many of you looking at this particular item might be well aware of foreign cinema, in all of it's delightfully un-Hollywood sentimentality.  If you've seen the movie - which I'll assume some of you have - you might have already formed a very specific opinion about it.  Perhaps the reason why is because the subject matter is very extreme, and it'd be more than a little difficult to walk away and not feel something.  Initially, I was disgusted.  I changed my mind, and I thought I'd share my reasoning here.
First of all, let's say for the sake of argument that the world has various standards when it comes to morality in any film dealing with adult issues.  Some of you may have seen Lars Von Trier's ""Dogville"" and thought to yourself: ""That's one skewed paradigm.""  Be that as it may, it's no less plausible than the cinematic - or philosophic - paradigm of Steven Spielberg.  My point here is that we all look at and engage realities in a different way - and Japanese cinema is no different.  In his revelatory book ""Eros in Hell,"" Jack Hunter explores Japanese ""pink cinema.""  This film is among hundreds produced in an odd era of Japanese filmmaking.  Comparable with American ""blue movies,"" pinku eiga moved to explore the boundaries of s*x as art, but also the psychological implications between the graphic evidence.
It'd be easy to refer to this genre of filmmaking as horror/pornography; the more difficult path is examining it in the same light you might examine a film by Adriane Lyne or David Cronenberg.  Their general aesthetic is curiously akin to Japanese pink films.  So here's the breakdown: this film is, in my opinion, an exploration of s*x as statement which is then turned on it's head to direct it's audience in considering the right questions.

Jack Hunter's book will point out that this film in particular is an exception - in that while it shared a genre and a content with it's contemporaries, the bigger picture might actually have been a statement about pink cinema all together.  Consider, as you watch, that the s*x is almost cartoonish in it's frequency, that the humor is dry and nonchalant, and that the ending lends itself to a whole different mindset.  Without giving too much away, the end is similar to ""The Night Porter,"" or ""Dead Ringers.""
These comparisons are primarily in reference to the climactic scenes in each - where our hero and heroine (in spite the difficulty with which they hold the title) pull out of the outside world completely into some kind of isolated space.  Up to this point we've seen our protagonists weather scrutiny and obstacles to be fulfilled.  In fact we - the audience - have done most of the scrutinizing and castigating.  I know I wasn't rooting for these people for the better part of their respective stories, but I felt as if I were driving them away into reclusiveness by lacking compassion for them.
Only when each set of characters are alone do we start to feel less accusatory and unforgiving.  We realize - or so the hope might be - that their's is a deep spiritual bond.  One you might expect to see between to loveable Hollywood starlets in a romantic comedy.  But that isn't exactly the way things are.  Though this example is relatively melodramatic, you can understand why they have arrived at such an intimacy.
They've reached that place with each other because we, the audience, didn't believe they could. We passed them off as s*x-crazed sociopaths.  And honestly, they were.  But I think a real interesting point the film made to me was how deeply they were connected in spite of the superficial s*xuality.  This is a hard-learned lesson, and one you'll have to dig deep for.  But consider for a moment that America doesn't own the patent on love stories, and that additionally love stories aren't always cute or clean or pure.  Perhaps from the filmmaker's perspective love was an ugly, dirty thing - until it existed in a place where it was solemnly understood.
And without the world coming down on the protagonists - from without the constraints of society or the status quo - their particular kind of love was much easier to understand.  I'm not saying that you'll instantly say to yourself: ""Hey, wait a second... that was just love, not graphic s*x.""  I just took it with a grain of salt and thought of it as a near-parody.  The fact of the matter is that you can point out blatant exaggerations in a great deal of Japanese contemporary media, and this film is no exception.
This obviously does not solve the problem of ""just too much graphic s*x for my liking.""
""The Night Porter,"" directed by Liliana Cavani, is somewhat less intense.  That isn't to say it's devoid of intensity, or that you'll have a nice dinner-date movie on hand.  It is to say that the s*xual content is far less prominent - and miraculously it gets the same point across in it's decidedly more watered-down, Western way.  And as far as I'm concerned, that message is ""intimacy can't be readily depicted in cinema without alienating the audience, because ideally - intimacy is a very exclusive thing.""
It takes a patient person to watch ""In The Realm of the Senses.""  It takes a lot of courage to appreciate it.  However, save for the actors (or in the case of ""In the Realm..."" the real-life people it was inspired by) - don't expect anyone to completely understand the intimacy.  This film will haunt some of you with that prospect.",1082332800,10,5408,4.703821656050955
190191,1,1572528338,"I don't want to try and write any kind of review about whether or not this movie is pornography. Frankly, it doesn't matter whether or not is pornographic in nature. I don't even care that there was as much sex in it as there was.
What bothers me is simply this: there isn't a story. I watched this movie after hearing many different things from many different people--I was told that it was a beautiful story about love, a disturbing story about obsession, a freaky naughty movie, and a brilliant artistic movie. People told me all these things and I watched it hoping to see strong characters and a powerful plot.
The graphic sex isn't my complaint. Or even the fact that Oshima filmed real sexual acts instead of simulated ones (although that is, to me, a very troubling fact). My complaint is that the movie is an hour and forty minutes, but only about five minutes of that time is spent trying to get us to have any compassion for the characters. The rest of it is spent on sex scenes that never seem to work together to create any semblance of a story.
What are their motivations? Who knows--it seems like they just want to have sex. Their dreams? Who cares--they're having lots of sex. Are they in love? Who could tell--all they do is have sex and obsess with each other. What are their personalities like, I wonder? You'll never figure it out--the movie spends all of two scenes trying to describe what kinds of people our hero/heroine are. The best I can understand is this: the woman likes to have lots of sex (I'm not being repetitive here--that's actually the line of dialogue that comes out of her mouth), and the man... well, they didn't really talk much about him. But my guess is that his personality involves sex.
If you want a movie that is disturbing, then by all means watch this one. Oshima does a great job of creating something bizarre and disjarring, but he hardly creates something important (or even entertaining). By the end of the movie, you don't feel as if you have just gained anything from viewing it. Instead, it feels like you've just watched two people have lots of sex... and that's about it.
People have made much of the beauty of this film, but it is neither erotic or meaningful. With flat characters and non-stop sex sequences (not to mention the aimless, gratuitous rape scenes), it seems less like a movie and more like a documentary on the Nature channel. Swap the Japanese setting with the Serengeti and you'll quickly find yourself wondering why we're calling this movie such a wonderful achievement in cinema. ...",1080604800,14,2559,4.614035087719298

But it is well made, and it proved an important point: that the western idea that sex or nudity must not be shown in a serious film is just wrong. It only seems wrong to show nudity or sex when the film makers are trying at the same time *not* to do it. If it is a natural part of the film, there is no problem whatsoever.

190193,4,1572528338,"I like Asian cinema. I really haven't seen all that many of these types of films, but the few I viewed over the past two or three years were excellent in terms of plot, special effects, and cinematography. The best thing about films from Japan and Hong Kong, and let's face it, these are the ones we're all talking about, is their non-western views about movie violence and adult situations. These guys are simply more willing to push envelopes we wouldn't think of touching. Well, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" not only pushes envelopes, it shreds them into tiny pieces. This taboo busting film claims a real event in 1930's Japan as the basis for a love story the likes of which you have rarely seen. This is the type of celluloid nightmare that stays with you long after the closing credits fade into darkness. ""In the Realm of the Senses"" mixes pornography, psychotic obsession, and grisly special effects to produce a volatile cocktail that will ambush those individuals not used to extreme cinema.
Set in a Japan gearing up for war, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" introduces the viewer to a brothel where the young Abe Sada works. One of the regular customers is Kichizo, an older married man who enjoys the company of the geishas. It isn't too long before Sada and Kichizo meet, and the two rapidly move into deeper and deeper realms of obsession and sexual adventure. The game, although it sure doesn't seem like a playful adventure, transmogrifies into open menace on the part of Sada, who threatens to maim or kill Kichizo if he pays the slightest attention to his wife. Even the other women in the brothel become fearful and chary about the strange events unfolding between the two lovers. Sada and Kichizo stay in a single room for days, without bathing or cleaning the floors. The obsession the two possess for each other often causes day-to-day worries to fade into the background. Things sink to such a bizarre level that the conclusion really shouldn't come as a surprise, although it does because of its emotional shot to the stomach. This is an incredible experience that many will not or cannot fathom, let alone comprehend. I'm not sure I understand several of the film's elements, probably due in large part to the atrocious DVD version constructed by Fox Lorber.
I recognize this is a foreign film and therefore possibly problematic for English speaking technicians, but this DVD is poorly made. The English subtitles rarely match up with the person speaking; the transfer doesn't look as good as it should, and even when I used the zoom function I knew I wasn't seeing the film the way the director intended. You get glimpses of how good the film must look when properly formatted and fully restored, such as brilliant flashes of color from Sada's kimonos and the lighting used by director Nagisa Oshima STILL looks great despite the bad transfer. A movie this powerful deserves much better than this stilted treatment. I've heard bad things about Fox Lorber concerning other DVD releases, and I tend to believe those statements now after seeing how they butchered this film.
I am sure there are numerous subtexts drifting through ""In the Realm of the Senses,"" but I am not sure what they all are. I couldn't help but notice how the rigid Japanese social system repeatedly reared its head. The women all refer to Kichizo as ""master"" and readily submit to his attentions even when they do not wish to do so. That's what makes the conclusion so surprising; that a woman in Japanese society did what she did must have been absolutely mind blowing to the patriarchal social hierarchy. Another aspect of the film certainly dealt with the war and Japan's machismo based discipline, but I cannot say exactly how it fits into the picture. After all, I only noticed one scene where I saw any soldiers. Is the obsession between Sada and Kichizo paralleled with the deadly obsession Japan had for its war plans? I'm probably reaching badly with this, but Japan's disastrous bid for world domination must play a role in this somewhere.
I won't watch this again until a company releases a decent DVD edition. I probably wouldn't watch it again soon anyway because the movie is so darn intense it takes awhile to absorb what you're seeing. It blows my mind that this got a theatrical release in the States back in the 1970s. I'll bet a lot of people had no idea what they got themselves into when they decided to spend a few hours with Nagisa Oshima's psychological tour de force. When they rated it NC-17 for the DVD release, they knew what they were talking about!",1059004800,8,4572,4.723404255319149
190194,4,1572528338,"By now everyone knows this film is about a sexually-obsessed woman who strangles and then cuts off her lover's willie (the extent to which her lover shared in the extremety of her obsession is somewhat debatable...).  That notwithstanding, the film is well-acted, visually stylish, and manages to convey a genuine feeling for the passion which drove the characters.  It's also succinct (at 96 minutes) and has some fabulous sex scenes.
The real-life case of 'Abe Sada' (Abe is the family name) was very well known in Japan, occurring almost 40 years before Oshima made this film.  There are at least two other cinematic versions of the events.  If anything, reality was even a bit stranger than fiction: in the real-life case Abe was arrested whilst carrying around the severed member in her kimono sash.  I saw a photograph of her once, taken just after her arrest: you have never seen a more haunted-looking woman.
The original Japanese title of the film is 'Ai no Corrida,'  'Ai' means 'love', but, interestingly, 'Corrida' is not a Japanese word at all: it's a Spanish word meaning 'dash' 'sprint' or 'spurt', and is most often used in the expression 'Corrida de Toros' -- i.e. bullfight -- strongly alluding to the brutal (and inevitable) death of the bull at the end.  This puts quite a different complexion on the theme of the film than does the Western distributor's title of 'In the Realm of the Senses' which seems to imply sensual pleasure which has perhaps unintentionally got out of hand.
Oshima's stock-in-trade has always been the 'shocking' film, usually made with the aim of confronting 'bourgeous' sensibilities or an accepted view of society or history.  In the 1960's they were more of the socio-political variety (e.g. 'The Sun's Burial,' 'Cruel Story of Youth'); but the success of this film firmly added the sexual element to his repertoire; you can see this continues even up to the recent film 'Gohatto.'  In my mind, however, 'Ai no Corrida' is the only one of his films that really works.
A quibble with the DVD version (I don't have the American Fox-Lorber one that so many have bitterly complained about, but the European one by Nouveau Entertainment) is that it appears to be a transfer from VHS: the English subtitles are part of the film image and not selectable (i.e. you can't turn them off).

190201,4,1572528338,"Based on a true story, Nagisa Oshima's 1976 film about possession, sexual obsession and love, is still fresh in its portrayal of a woman named Matsuda who struggles to posses her husband Fuji, wholly and completely.
In what must be one of the most shocking movies to come out of Japan in decades,
Nagisa's skillful use of location builds a claustrophobic atmosphere of intimacy, with very little light, cramped space and no fresh air (minor character comments about the smell that builds in the room the couple are in). Though at times seemingly pretentious, my feeling is that this may be due to the translation.
From beginning to end the controversial and explicit nature of the film will either turn you on, or off or leave you in jaw-dropping awe. Its still amazing what the two main actors do for this film, and the levels they go to, to bring these two characters to life.

190202,4,1572528338,"This movie is probably the most erotic film that I've seen to date (pornos notwithstanding). It is a movie about obsession and what can happen when it gets out of control, something that this movie demonstrates well. However, I wished the movie had delved into the background of the characters, especially Sada's. If the audience watching this film knew about Sada's past, where she was raped and then outcaste by her wealthy family because of it, I think the audience would have a better understanding about the reason for Sada's behavior. Still, despite that and an undeveloped plot, the movie is still entertaining.  However, if you want to see a more sanitized version of this story, which is based on an actual event that took place in Tokyo in 1936, then get ""A Woman Called Sada Abe"", which is available on both VHS and DVD. From what I've heard, it doesn't have nearly as much sex and nudity as ""In the Realm of the Senses"", which is a good thing for people who are easily offended by it.  Personally, I liked the sex scenes, which I felt were tasteful and elegant, unlike what would normally be found in a pornographic movie. There was a lot of emotion displayed in those scenes, and that gave it a certain romantic, authentic dimension to it.

During summer of 1977, teenager takes family-trip north to Martha's Vineyard, to visit extended family.  Larenz Tate, was a little old for this role, even in 94, but he is convincing enough to pull it off. During this trip Tate's character is faced with several issues, including sex and adulthood.

He succumbs to the selfish demands of the Jada Pinkett character, Laura, who has her own use for Tate. Joe Morton and Glynn Turman, as always give enjoyable performances.

The box  however states 104 minutes, which is of course not correct and beware of  the 1.66:1 full screen format!

Some scenes are zoomed in so that  nothing offensive could be seen and others are panned to the right or left  for the same effect.

190210,4,1572528338,"My instinct to revisit this cinematographic experience was prompted by its near-controversial debate in a recent film festival back in Singapore... ... of how a motion picture produced more than twenty years ago continues  to shock with its 'sexually explicit' content, and an almost hopeless  proposition for the local censorship board to re-evaluate its opinion  regarding the film's public release; submitted by 'crusaders for the arts'  from a Singaporean film society.
Those in favour of the said release  demanded for both government and people (in general) to promote a culture  whereby art, in all its various forms and representations, could be  embraced with a 'cosmopolitanly matured' attitude. The opposition on the  other hand, implied the film to be sheer pornography, a 'meaningless'  picture with zero cultural or moral substance.
While I do personally feel  sceptical about the feasibility of its public release, I also do frown upon  the latter opinions. This film should, and could be publicly released to  any population, subject to its cultural susceptibility to artistic  induction...whereby the majority can interpret the arts and differing  culture, perspectorial realms and backgrounds...for this film, in short; a  people that can siphon the sex from the subliminally realistic and  disturbing body...which is both dark and true to the core... something that  most minds living under seemingly autocratically dictatorial affiliating  bodies (i.e. a stern cultural censor) will fail to grasp.
This film  provokes both intense and passionate emotions, which amidst the implied  sexual propagation, highlights a humane agenda of varying extremes. Its  subtle message can only be decoded by a culturally adept and mature  audience. It describes unpretentiously, the nether regions of the human  mind and the expressive fantasies that are within its dark fathoms.
For  those who (honestly) view this film as nothing but a pornographic title,  they have all missed the bottomline and the whole story  altogether.
Director Oshima has successfully created a film which  demonstrates human emotions at levels that are deemed socially incorrect to  many and incomprehensible by most. One can empathise also with those who  refuse to accept the actual message out of both shame and disgust, a piety  induced by many cultures.
I salute the country's effort in sustaining  her nation's moral integrity. Alas, the opposite can only be said about the  statutory body/ies that continually preaches its efforts in promoting  international culture so as to realise and enhance a 'cosmopolitanly adept'  nation; while being extremely conservative in its seemingly  holier-than-thou judgements over the past years.",952473600,7,2720,5.5512195121951216

It's  just another circus side show like ""Caligula"" was, masquerading  as art. What is really troubling is the misogyny of the film. It plays into  the ancient, and worn out, myth of women as really being obsessed sexual  monsters out to destroy male sexual power, symbolized at the end of the  film.

If you plan to watch this movie for a cheap sexual thrill, you  will be most disappointed. Oshima has drawn from a real incident reported  in a  1936 Japanese newspaper.  The film centers around the love between  two people expressed physically, graphically, into realms of the senses  where few dare to tread. And with good reason. This is a very intense film  as it progresses from the attraction of two people through increasing  experimentation in an effort not only to express their passion but to try  to find the outer most limits of passion itself. Oshima must have had  something metaphorical in mind but the journey as chronicled in the film  also has retained the feel of the specifics. It's quirkey and eccentric.  The backdrop of the story is as interesting as the story itself. It is an  amazing spectacle to observe, giving the viewer a perspective on Japanese  life not usually rendered but often alluded to in some historical accounts.  One wonders what this experience must have been like for the actors. Oshima  has managed what I have always believed should be done in order to treat  the subject of sex fully and without shrinking from its' less savory  aspects. This is serious minded erotica and quite unlike anything else on  screen. The only other film I can recall that compares at all is ""Taxi  Zum Klo"" which was autobiographical and starred a number of actual  people playing themselves. Obviously a different catagory in that regard  from what is going on here, but both films draw much of their power from  explicitly sexual scenes without compromising the integrity of the story  being told.

1976

Film = two (2) stars; restoration/preservation = five (5) stars; cinematography and lighting = five (5) stars; costume design = four (4) stars; subtitles = four (4) stars; script = two (2) stars; score/music = two (2) stars.  This is a joint French and Japanese film intended (at least initially) for Western festival audiences.  Director Nagisa shima (who is also credited as a script co-writer) mounts a tale of a woman with an exceptionally bad case of penis envy who eventually gets to keep one (until arrested for murder!).  The movie consists of simulated and real oral/vaginal sex plus a few random scenes of relative depravity (including some kiddy porn) tossed in to hold in check the viewer's growing boredom from seeing essentially the same sex shots repeated for about an hour and a half.  shima also strains to keep the viewer's interest with variations on the theme of sexual obsession.  This parallels what the two leading characters are experiencing as they try out ever increasing dangerous sex experiments to keep getting a sexual high 24/7 (a classic sign of additive behavior, of course).  The script is vacuous and mostly consists of one liners.  Unfortunately it is the same line (""It feels so good"") with minor variations thereof here and there. The players are Japanese speaking Japanese.  But all post production occurred and stayed in France (including development of negatives!) to avoid running afoul of Japan's legal system.  Acting is a cut or two above what might be expected from a contemporary run-of-the- mill porno film.  Same for production design.  Restoration, cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) and lighting are excellent.  Kimono are especially colorful and seem designed especially for backdoor ""quickies.""  Subtitles are fine (it helps if you can read French for the opening/closing credits).  Music mostly consists of solitary shamisen on or off screen.  It is what it is!
