8506141,5,B006X64L78,"Gutsy approach to a medium most find difficult to master. Using the Hake brush takes some practice but get you out of the distractions of worring about ""shape, size, line, direction, texture, value and color"". It's a ""make it happen"" technique that Cronin demonstrates can produce atmospheric watercolors.",1360454400,4,305,5.375
8506142,5,B006X64L78,"This is the second DVD of Mr. Cornin's I've reviewed.  As good as volume 3 was, volume 5 has shone vast improvements in technique.  Steven is truly the master of the hake brush.  Volume 5 contains 6 landscape lessons; same as volume 3.  You would do yourself a good deed by adding this volume to your library.  Let's hope an upcoming volume will include some of the cityscapes he advertised on YouTube earlier this year.  His depiction of architecture is astonishing.",1350864000,5,467,4.703703703703703
