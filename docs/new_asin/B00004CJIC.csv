7919964,5,B00004CJIC,"Mandela(1987) as portrayed by Danny Glover is one of those classic movies/documentaries one would want
to keep in his library. It's been many years since i saw this film, and i must admit that despite my
tender age of 13 when my family was owning this film, its memory is still intact.
It's unfortunate that the film is not available in DVD today. But, even in VHS quality and availability, some
antiques, the notable of this film never surrenders to the new ones.
Danny Glover was extremely outstanding in his portrayal of Nelson Mandela's struggles for South Africa-tussling
with the security apparatus of the Apartheid regime(the apparent machinery of the government), haggling in courts for his peoples' rights to vote, his seduction and woo of Winnie Madikizela, and his versatile disposition[s] in dealing with the day to day challenges
of a 'segregated society' before he was sent to languish in jail.",1259366400,6,908,5.0198675496688745
