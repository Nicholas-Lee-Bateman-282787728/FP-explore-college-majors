8101701,2,B000CSCYHM,"Literally you are watching Laird and JAW sitting in chairs while Laird talks about his (controversial and ain't necessarily so) concepts about parallels between the dogon and the ancient egyptians.  This is really all about Laird, little about Egypt, and I'm not sure what JAW is doing here.  This is the least Egyptian of the entire series and it REALLY out of place.  This should have left on the cutting room floor, posted as free on you tube, or something.  Watch it but don't pay full fare.",1391040000,,495,4.655172413793103
8101702,5,B000CSCYHM,Great stuff!! On a par with the rest of the Magical Egypt series. This work by Laird Scranton is another nail in the coffin of the orthodox Egyptological establishment. Keep up the great work John!,1193875200,4,197,4.6571428571428575
