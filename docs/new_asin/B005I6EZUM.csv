8474291,5,B005I6EZUM,Good video with the exact content I needed.,1486684800,,43,4.5
8474292,5,B005I6EZUM,"The description on the video packaging was accurate. This legend will impact generations to come. His son now carries the torch, it's up to Shorinkan practioners to continue the legacy.",1479081600,,185,5.2
8474293,5,B005I6EZUM,"Although only a few of the katas are done by Grand Master Hanshi Shuguro Nakazato, this DVD is very good. It's really nice to see all the karate and kobudo katas performed in order to study them in more depth. If you are a student of Shorin Kan Shorin Ryu this will be beneficial to you.",1456790400,,287,4.142857142857143
8474294,5,B005I6EZUM,I studied under the directorship of Shuguro Nakazato under sense Gary Cain who is now deceased. It was great to see the old master demo kata and kobudo. I train everyday although not so vigorous.,1436400000,,195,4.6
8474295,4,B005I6EZUM,"I will say that this video should have just been titled ""Shorinkan Shorin-Ryu,"" rather than using Nakazato Sensei's name, since Nakazato Sensei only runs one kata in the whole video. It is really good to see so many senior Shorinkan karateka--some of whom are no longer in the Shorinkan--performing kata on video. The video seems to be an impromptu session, shot all at once in the dojo after classes, rather than a professional studio session.",1419638400,3,444,4.933333333333334
8474296,5,B005I6EZUM,"If you are part of the Shorinkan system Nakazato Ha of Kobayashi Shorin Ryu this is a great video to have. To watch the top senseis of the Shorinkan perform the katas both karate and kobudo is inspirational and educational .
This video helped me alot as Im a recent convert to Shorin Ryu coming from many years of Shotokan it helped me start to a re adjust my kata from the shotokan to the shorin ryu",1388707200,2,400,4.207792207792208
8474297,4,B005I6EZUM,This is an interesting cd. It shows all the katas of the system as well as those creates by Nakazato Sensei. This is another must have for the serious martial artist.,1368144000,,166,4.387096774193548
