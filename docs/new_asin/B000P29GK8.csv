2807638,3,B000P29GK8,"A piece of fluff where the cute little dog - guess what - steals the show, this film stars some fairly big names such as Don Cheadle as the therapist who urges the main character to get a dog to help solve his anxiety problems. Complications ensue. Strippers enter the picture. Some lovely interiors and interesting LA scenery. Great popcorn movie.",1236729600,,348,4.721311475409836
2807639,4,B000P29GK8,"This is a little film with a big heart.  It is truly an independant film and shows what the genre is capable of.  The always reliable Giovanni Ribisis is hilarious here as a down trodden writer with writers block who is miserable and lonely with life plus broke on top of it all.  He has been in daily therapy for a year and when he needs to stop due to funds his therapist suggests he get a pet.

Our main character gets a dog and half heartedly tries to take to the new addition in his life.  He desperately fears the attachment.  Many characters enter the story and all end up getting involved with the story of the dog.  Our writer meets a woman with whom he starts to form a friendship which is also new to him.

The dog is perfectly cast and has great film presence.  Your heart will melt.  The acting here is all superb and the story flows along and will surprise you with a very emotional ending.  The self discovery our main character goes through due to the dogs presence in his life is huge and truly believable.

This film is very well made and well directed.  It is funny but in a realistic way.  Give this film a chance.  It will put you on a true emotional journey well worth taking.  And if you love dogs it's just an added bonus!",1222300800,8,1246,4.194092827004219
2807640,5,B000P29GK8,"I had no idea what this movie was about and was going to Tivo it but it grabbed my attention from the very moment it started.  I watched it right then and Tivo'd it.  It was so enjoyable and such a nice change of pace from all the violence and movies without substance.  Giovanni Ribisi was wonderful and quirky.  I just love watching this guy take any role and make it his own.  When I realized Scott Caan was also in it and had written and directed, I was even more pleased.  He can do it all!  The writing and dialog is so real and everyone is perfectly cast.  Of course, just watching the dog was entertaining in itself.  The pup was precious and I found myself laughing out loud at him just prancing down the street.  The would really be a wonderful date movie.  I hope we see and hear more from Scott Caan!",1221609600,,812,4.174193548387096
2807641,5,B000P29GK8,"Being a big fan of Giovanni Ribisi, I had to see this little movie. I was pleasantly surprised watching this well written tale of a writer who has become unable to write, function and has run out of money to pay for his therapy. His therapist suggest he buy a pet, so the young writer buys a cute little dog to take care of and hopefully help him get out of his unhealthy daily routine.

The film is full of good performances and insight. The dog is completely mesmerizing as he does little to convey so much. The scenes with the dog just doing nothing with the comical score in the background are priceless! It's a very entertaining movie with a great cast and impressive direction by Scott Caan(James son), who wrote and also plays Ribisi's best friend. This is a cool film that is like a short subject, but has a lot to offer bewteen the lines. I can see this becoming a cult favorite!",1221004800,18,888,4.349397590361446

Well this quirky little film, shot in Los Angeles, is another one!  I rented this movie twice before I decided it had to be in my ""Permanent"" Collection.  Giovanni Ribisi is perfect in this film as a ""depressed"" writer (In LA? come on!!) and the supporting cast doesn't let you down.  A real indy delight.",1207526400,10,428,4.5064935064935066

Not for you if your looking for action, or sex.

It's not as good as American pie, knocked up or super bad. And it doesn't try to be.  It is a light hearted romantic comedy that delivers a few laughs, but you won't be disapointed if you miss it. Or remember it long after you've seen it.  In short it's ok to kill a few hours,  ok rental,  don't bother buying, Oh and definately not for the little kids as there are several moments in the movie of extremly vulgar language, if your looking for nudity definately skip because there is just a quick flash of nipples and that is it.",1198454400,,665,4.28
2807645,5,B000P29GK8,"You must see this movie!

I rented this film on a whim because I love dogs, and also, Giovani Ribisi (...who couldn't?). Then I bought it.

Boy was I glad I did.

The dialogue is extremely well written and funny, the photography is gorgeous, the acting superb, and the story profound, quirky, warm, full of insight, and often laugh-out-loud hilarious.

Anyone who tends to get addicted to a certain movie will, most likely, develop a habit for this one. It's a work of art.

Hip. Kooky. Touching. Somewhat twisted. Ultimately moving.

2807673,5,B000P29GK8,"Loved this movie, from the cast to the dog, to the music, to the brilliant graphics for the opening credits. Way more fun than most recent big studio comedies. Giovanni Ribisi is an absolutely winning, touching grouch of a hero, Lynn Collins grounds the film as the earthy dancer who likes him. Don Cheadle in uncredited support as Ribisi's standoffish psych is spot on, as is Mena Suvari as the spoiled rich girl who wants both Ribisi's dog and Kevin Corrigan's loan shark Benny. As Ribisi's skirt-chasing best friend, Scott Caan is doing a part he can ace in his sleep, but it's his superior sense of comedy that is the secret to the film's success. He wrote and directed it with salty sparkle -- and, to top it off, has made the canniest, best use of Corrigan that I have seen to date.",1406592000,,788,4.479166666666667

2807676,3,B000P29GK8,"Okay movie but could have been better.  The very likable Giovanni Ribisi and Scott Caan, who is also the director and son of Hollywood heavy-hitter James Caan, just don't have a lot to work with in this lightweight comedy, which is not much more than a notch above a made-for-TV movie.  Scott Caan's clout also was apparently enough to get Mena Suvari and Kevin Corrigan on board in supporting roles, and wait, yes, there's also Oscar nominee and Golden Globe Winner Don Cheadle, playing a shrink, who may be too good for this movie.  The first 15 minutes and last 15 minutes are worth a chuckle or two, but it's the hour in between with the ""problem"" that just doesn't seem well polished, though Ribisi's and Caan's presence are just enough to keep it afloat.  The female exotic dancer scenes also don't quite fit in and certainly weren't integral to the plot!  After all, this is basically a movie about how a dog's unconditional love can lift your spirits and change your life; too bad the movie doesn't quite do that.

2807679,4,B000P29GK8,"Written and directed by Scott Caan, 'The Dog Problem' follows a novelist with enough issues that he goes broke seeing a shrink. Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) gets himself a dog (Jimmy the Dog) on the advice of his therapist (Don Cheadle). Unfortunately, Solo's only had one good book, and now he's broke. The guy he owes money to? Wants his new dog as payment. A rich gal Solo's best friend Casper (Scott Caan) knows? Wants his dog. The doorman of his therapist's building? Wants his dog. And Solo? Well, turns out he wants his dog, too. Amongst the antics of Casper the photographer's womanizing and nude-picture-taking ways, the complex Lola (Lynn Collins), who he meets at a dog park and his own  numerous issues and inability to move past his tortured mind, Solo has to decide what he really wants...and then act on it.

Scott Caan excels at ""slice-of-life""stories that tug at the heart strings, and take the time to examine human relationships. Once again, following something that he not only wrote, but also directed and co-starred in, takes you through the mind of a man trying to figure out what it is that makes people tick...and trying to discover what it is that makes relationships between friends and lovers both work and fail.

Mr. Caan writes what he knows, which means that like Johnny Ryan in 'Mercy,' the character Solo is a novelist. Also like Johnny Ryan - and Dallas from 'Dallas 362' - the character Casper is womanizing, oftentimes a jerk, and someone without a lot of depth. Well, Johnny had way more depth after he met title character Mercy, but that's another movie and story altogether.

It's interesting once you've seen several things written by Mr. Caan, how many similarities there are among the characters he writes and especially the ones he winds up portraying himself. You start seeing common threads and for me, it makes me insanely curious as to what it is that keeps him going on the same sort of topic over and over...until I realize it's because he truly is trying to figure it all out.

To that end, 'The Dog Problem' seems to really deliver on this quest for Caan. Solo finally finds what he's looking for and realizes that it's not really what he needs. His therapist more makes him figure things out himself than actually gives him answers, and his dog getting into a fight with a stripper's friend's dog at the dog park leads him to find someone he can be himself with, and be completely honest with.

With very little help from Casper...and really, donning a pig's head while shooting photos of stripper Candy in her lingerie...really????...not much help from a dog who does little more than just sit and lay around, and no help at all from crazy, wacky people in his life who want to take his dog, Solo eventually decides what he has to do, and it's not what you're going to expect at all. I must admit, Mr. C.'s character was...how shall I put it...charmingly cute...when he's all over Candy at the restaurant. Okay, that sounded ridiculous, but it's the best way I can describe it.

(Tell me you don't actually put a pig's head on when photographing your subjects, Mr. C., please...)

One thing I did not like about the movie, that I think actually affected the whole story from front to back, was Jimmy the Dog's portrayal of Spot. I have no doubt that as the director, Caan was totally okay with the fact that this dog did...absolutely nothing except for walking through the streets of LA near the end...for the majority of the movie. Who knows, maybe Spot was meant to act depressed. However, in spite of the fact that Spot was cute, he wasn't nearly cute enough for me to believe that all these people in Solo's life want the dog so much they're pitting their bodyguards against each other in the street to see who should be able to take him.

The dog from 'Frasier?' Yeah, that I could see. The one from 'As Good As It Gets' or even Benji, I'd believe. But the little guy in this movie just sat around like a bump on a log (when he wasn't relieving himself on Solo's carpet or bathroom floor), and it just did not endear him to me enough to believe people broke into Solo's place and dognapped him (or at least, that's what Solo thinks). Did not work for me, unfortunately.

What I very much liked about the movie, and what I have liked about everything I've seen that Mr. Caan's written, is the psychology of the characters - their complexity, them being so messed up and them trying to figure everything out (unless they don't want to, and just remain as messed up as they were at the outset). I definitely did not get a sucker punch on this one like I did with 'Dallas 362' and 'Mercy,' but I did get an unexpected surprise at the end that left me very unsettled.

And overall, that's why I keep coming back for more, trying to make sure I watch everything I can written by Mr. Caan. Because there's always something so real about what he writes that it's oftentimes uncomfortable to the point of being embarrassing. And that's life. Real life. Not Hollywood glitter and oh-so-perfect-but-ridiculously-caricatured people. Were parts of this movie funny? Absolutely. (Not the pig's head...that was just...disturbing!) Were parts of the movie sad? Definitely. Touching? Mmhmm.

Was the movie good? Other than the dog not being nearly what I would've expected from the context of the movie, yes. I love watching the characters grow and change (even Casper seems more serious about Candy than previous females he's had). Thank you, Mr. Caan, for bringing what you do best to us again with this foray into the human psyche.

I'd say, audience, that it's definitely worth your time.",1315008000,,5627,4.6545820745216515

2807681,4,B000P29GK8,"""When a man's best friend is a dog, that dog has a problem.""
 (from the opening credits)

This basically unknown oddball Independent film is an entertaining dark comedy. It's rated R mainly because of off color language and some sexual situations, which are hardly graphic. Underneath, this film is ultimately good natured at its core.
A shrink tells a young writer named Solo, who's troubled and lonely, to try owning a pet to aid his therapy, so he hesitantly gets a  ""so ugly it's cute"" puppy from the pet shop at the local mall. He's totally clueless on how to care for it.
However, from that day forward he is never the same again.
Suddenly and unaccountably, everyone he encounters becomes smitten by his puppy, who's the real star in this feature.
The themes hinge on lost hope and looking for love and connection in a confusing world.
Solo happens to meet a pretty woman who, unexpectedly, is also troubled and lonely.
Aside from the language, this is a surprisingly charming and quirky little film involving lost souls who meet a dog that inadvertently leads him to some answers about their plight in life.
This is lighthearted fun but not exactly a family or children's movie.
The ending is touching and sweet.
Dog owners in particular will get a real kick out of this film.",1282521600,,1284,4.697777777777778
2807682,4,B000P29GK8,"Does love conquer all? Whether it does or not, it is comforting to believe so, which is why every season engenders a newborn litter of romantic comedies to keep the faith. The distinguishing marks of the species are quirky characters, unlikely plots and witty repartee. ""The Dog Problem"" is an admirable specimen of this breed.
  Solo Harrington has lost it all. He wrote ""The Naked Abyss"", a bad novel that made him a bucket of money but cost him his moorings. To find himself, he has spent five days a week for almost a year with his psychiatrist Doctor Nourmand and now all the money is gone so he no longer has even the solace of therapy. He is in hock to Benny the loan shark who is threatening to break his legs. His carefree friend Casper thinks Solo is at his creative best when he is miserable, but Solo is so empty inside that he cannot write his way out of his twitchy funk. Does Doctor Nourmand have a prescription for him? He does.
  ""Do you ever consider getting a pet?""
  Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) finds a tiny terrier in a pet store at a mall in L.A. that he hopes will pull him off the treadmill: ""Eat. Sleep. Therapy. Repeat.""
  At first there is only disappointment. Solo can summon neither the energy to feed his new companion nor the imagination to name him. The dog barks, pees on the carpet, poops on the bathroom floor. He does not play well with others. At the dog park, Solo meets Lola (Lynn Collins), a world-weary stripper who has resigned herself to solitude and celibacy. She loans Solo the money to have his dog patched up after he tangles with a pit bull.
  Solo is ready to call it quits with the dog. Casper knows Jules (Mena Suvari), a sun-baked, soul-bleached rich bitch who wears her ennui like a pricey rag from Rodeo Drive and has nothing better to do than to collect pooches to accessorize her wardrobe. She fancies the dog, but Solo cannot bring himself to sell him to her.
  Benny (Kevin Corrigan) also covets the dog and considers him his property anyway since Solo purchased him with owed money. Solo discovers he could no more surrender his dog to a loan shark than add another bad novel to his resume. ""One second he's just a dog and the next thing you know he's mine.""
  Determined to acquire the dog, even if they have to have their bodyguards slug it out for the honor, Jules and Benny make camp at Solo's apartment. ""Life is a delicate negotiation,"" Solo confesses to his canine. They need to take their uneasy bargain elsewhere.
  They are a third and fourth wheel at the live-in photography studio where Casper (Scott Caan) is enthusiastically entwined with Candy (Sarah Shahi), Lola's pal from the strip club, so they take shelter with Lola. Lola too is smitten - with Solo or with the dog? ""There are people who would pay big money for that little dog,"" Solo confides. He is unsure what to do with his dog, his writing, or his life. Lola sums up her own romantic outlook, ""It sucks to love something. Every time you do it has a bad ending.""
  Surrounded by all these problem people, what is a dog to do? With ubiquitous Jonesy's Jukebox ever on the radio yawning sarcasm about the attenuated joys of life in the Southland and Missing Persons on the soundtrack singing ""nobody walks in L.A."", the dog decides he had better take the situation into his own paws.
  In addition to providing cheerful compass headings for Solo as Casper, Scott Caan wrote and directed ""The Dog Problem"". Mark Mothersbaugh supplies the snappy music.
  Like Sherlock Holmes' ""curious incident of the dog in the night time"", something expected from the stable is missing: Don Cheadle plays Doctor Howard Nourmand. Yet that welcome fact is nowhere mentioned in the titles or credits, nor is the name of the character. The name of the title designer, however, who fashioned the ingenious, morphing, mirror image inkblots that identify the actors and production alphas, is Howard Nourmand.",1278460800,,3912,4.606628242074928

2807687,3,B000P29GK8,"I wouldn't call the Dog Problem a classic- but it DID have one thing in its favor that made it an above average film- it included a lot of jokes that were funny because of weird timing, odd choice of words, etc.

For example, in one scene the main character going to see his psychiatrist said the king of ALL swear words which caught the psychiatrist off guard.  It was right after the guy bought something for the psychiatrist and he refused to accept it.  These little moments made the film funnier than it would have been had the story not included this particular kind of humor.

This really wasn't a typical dog movie either.  Not like you really felt like loving and wanting to adopt such a lovely dog, because he wasn't a particularly pretty dog (matter of taste perhaps).

The style of humor this movie was going for had its shining moment when a bunch of people suddenly decided they all wanted the dog at once in one scene at the main characters apartment, and this led to lots of funny scenes that will make more sense when you see who these characters actually are.

But there were enough storyline twists, oddly interesting characters, and other things that made the movie pretty good.  The dog does something at the end that was both amazing and cute, and at the VERY end of the movie, the dog does something even more amazing.

It's not a family movie because of constant swear words being tossed around, but it's a decent movie.",1249344000,2,1444,4.501915708812261
