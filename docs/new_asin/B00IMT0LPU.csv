8643488,1,B00IMT0LPU,"I purchased this DVD on Amazon  Canada. Buy the original release DVD. Memories, Chronicles & Declarations Of Love. It has seven bonus tracks, three audio options & sub titles. The original is on Marisa's Phonomotor EMI label. I would have not purchased this third rate inferior rerelease' I thought I was buying something different. Artists do have much unreleased material. This is on some unknown bogus label. I am trying to find out from the seller if this is a legal release or a poor boot leg. I want to ask Amazon about this also. I also purchased the CD to this on Amazon UK. This would be something new because I do not think a CD was put out to go with the original DVD release around 2001-02. Same story, is it real or are they ripping off Marisa Monte?",1401667200,,763,4.411347517730497
