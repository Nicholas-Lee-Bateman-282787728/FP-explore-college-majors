7884499,5,6305112363,"Dawn French (British Comedian, of French & Saunders, Vicar of Dibley & Murder Most Horrid fame)turns her comic witt and critical eye on the subject of Large Women and how they are viewed in our society and culture. French peels away the glossy covers of todays magazines and beauty industry to show that big women have a strength, beauty and sexuality that the media hides or denys altogether. Often Dawn will give platform to industry insiders, photographers, and fellow feminists that unwittingly verbalize the exact biased that she is challenging. In this way we truly see the media's thought process at work (or not at work as the case maybe).  This is a great video for any women that is sick of being marginalized and taught to feel shame about her own body. A true celebration of big women.",976147200,36,797,4.733812949640288
