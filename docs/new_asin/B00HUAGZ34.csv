6208229,4,B00HUAGZ34,"I watch a lot of British television despite living in the U.S., so I admit, I took on this TV movie partly because I knew a few of the actors' work. Linus Roache, for example, once played a role on the long-running British show Coronation Street. His father, William Roache, has been on that program for 50 years.

Anyway, I liked the chemistry between the two leads here, and I thought their early scenes together were handled fairly well.  They obviously liked each other but felt awkward because of the circumstances.  They warm to each other.

The plot accelerates and moves in an unexpected direction, however. I saw another review that talked about it turning into a melodrama, and I think that is accurate. Personally, I would have scaled back on the overdone suspense and focused instead on developing the supporting characters and the relationships between all of them.

I also have a problem with two developments near the end.  I will try not to give too much away, but after a climactic scene involving Emily's friend Jane, it doesn't follow up on what happened to Jane. Did she get arrested? I will say no more - you will see when you watch it.  Also, Lord Walderhurst talks about sending two characters away, but wouldn't one of them have been put on trial in England for what she did?

With the plot moving faster and faster, and those observations I just made, it sort of felt to me like the first half of the program was rewritten many times while the second half was cobbled together.  Still, given a lot of what we see on TV, I would still recommend it.",1391817600,13,1572,4.565836298932385

6208237,1,B00HUAGZ34,What a ridiculous story. I've never wanted a heroine to die as much as this idiot. People as dumb as this should not be allowed to procreate so why would we want to use their stupidity as entertainment?,1519257600,,202,4.342105263157895
6208238,2,B00HUAGZ34,The film was fairly enjoyable for its predictability but it doesn't have to be so racist. I know it's an adaptation but artistic liberties could have been made during casting and the roles of the two female antagonists could have been rewritten instead of demonizing their ethnicity. Rewriting the characters just seems embarrassingly obvious.,1519084800,,343,5.37037037037037

6208241,5,B00HUAGZ34,"Read the negative reviews and expected the worst. However I love this movie and returned to watch favorite parts, such as the chess scene! The tender love developing between Emily and Lord Walderhust is delightful - a sweet balance between longing and awkwardness! The happy ending is a wonderful antidote to the poisonous jealousy of the villains. Worth my time and overall so satisfied with this visually beautiful production.",1517184000,,428,5.217391304347826
6208242,5,B00HUAGZ34,"Yes, it is nothing like the book, I don't read a book and then analyze the movie by comparing it to the book. Having that said,  I really enjoyed the movie at times I thought the main character made stupid choices and decision, but on a whole, it was good entertainment. I blamed her husband for not preparing his wife for the duties of the house.",1516320000,,347,4.257575757575758
6208243,2,B00HUAGZ34,I liked this movie alot until the main character became an insipid doormat & knew it & let it continue. Maddening melodrama is a hard pill for the modern woman to swallow.,1516320000,,171,4.375

6208245,5,B00HUAGZ34,"This is a loose adaptation of two novellas by Frances Hodgson Burnett. A young, well-educated woman named Emily Fox-Seton is living in genteel poverty, making for a hardscrabble existence. While working temporarily for Lady Maria Byrne, she meets her nephew, Lord Walderhurst, an attractive widower. He is looking for a wife, and despite the machinations of his aunt to find him a suitable wife, he makes Emily an offer she can't refuse, and she accepts. After all, she has nothing to lose. Lord Walderhurst will get a wife and the heir he desires,  and Emily will get a wealthy husband.

They sojourn to Lord Walderhurst's isolated country manor, and their burgeoning relationship exceeds both their expectations.  Then, he is called back to India with his regiment, and Emily is left alone in the house with the servants. Uninvited relatives of her husband drop in on Emily, and with her trusting nature she welcomes them into her home. Then the mood turns gothic and all hell breaks loose. While some of it quite melodramatic, it is always entertaining. I have viewed this period drama twice and really enjoyed it. The cast is likewise excellent. If one likes gothic thrillers, one will certainly enjoy this one.",1514160000,,1215,4.946078431372549

While this movie may not be in the same classical material of those two, the book this movie was based on was; it was written by Frances Hodgson Burnett of The Secret Garden fame. I didn't read this book, but still liked the movie for offering up a few chills in a suspenseful, Gothic tale.",1470355200,4,467,4.35632183908046

Let me just tell you that not only did we make it through the whole movie and enjoy EVERY MINUTE of it, but after we talked about all our favorite parts, giggled, sighed, laughed- we then REWATCHED the beginning at that very moment because it was just THAT GOOD.

6208288,1,B00HUAGZ34,"This movie is nothing like the title that it has.  The Making of a Lady infers that the movie would be about a commoner being trained to be a ""lady"".  It instead turned out to be more of a horror movie with blood on the hand of the deranged man while he kissed the servant and the ""lady"" afraid for her life constantly.  I would not recommend this for children at all and I will not watch this ever again myself!",1458691200,3,412,4.061728395061729

When he leaves to rejoin his regiment and his cousin shows up, the real weird stuff starts. This movie has a little bit of a mystery to it, until almost the very end when all is revealed.

6208316,3,B00HUAGZ34,"I like period movies, British movies, and Linus Roache. What could go wrong? Well, the implausible storyline was insane. It starts out normal enough, then veers off into really dark territory. The kicker is, EVERYTHING is foreshadowed. There is no surprise, AT ALL - except for the characters that all the action is happening to. The worst part is, this is supposed to be a love story, but there isn't a whole lot of loving behavior in it. Not for the main couple or the cousins. It's just really twisted.

It might have played better if the characters were more fleshed out, the plot wasn't given away so early in the game, and the characters weren't so isolated. Yes, I get it. They are ten miles out, but there still should have been swarms of people around given that they live on an estate (think Downton Abbey).

Anyway, it wasn't horrible, just implausible. Had it been more believable, I may have been more taken in.",1451174400,,924,4.593939393939394
6208317,4,B00HUAGZ34,I love this movie. I chose to watch it because Linus Roach plays the hero who marries a single woman for convenience and to produce the heir that will inherit his fortune and his title: Marquess. It is a lovely romance threatened by a greedy cousin and his wife. There is tension enough to keep you sitting on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. But it is worth it in the end.,1448236800,4,385,4.078947368421052
6208318,5,B00HUAGZ34,This is a lovely family movie and love story about a young innocent woman from a working-class family who marries an aristocrat and the trouble she encounters  because of her kindness and her compassionate heart.,1447804800,,212,5.057142857142857

6208321,5,B00HUAGZ34,"This Brit drama starts off in the world of Jane Austen.  Will poor,  but cultured Emily marry her employer's titled nephew, and if she does, how will the gentry treat her?  When I first started watching, I thought this was going to be a pleasant piece about a poor girl marrying up. Things were going along happily, but then they began taking a gothic twist.  It began to remind me of Wilkie Collins'  The Woman in White or maybe, Rebecca.  It's hard to describe it without giving away the plot.  Since I don't want to give any spoilers, let me just say people who like movies based on British literature, fans of gothic stories, and lovers of costume dramas will be likely to enjoy this.  The acting is excellent, costumes and sets are fabulous, and it moves along at a fast pace.  Highly recommend.",1444262400,,800,4.5

6208342,2,B00HUAGZ34,"I settled down with remote, for an entertaining piece of tv period fluff: camera closeups of fine costumes, handsome faces and enviably beautiful figure of the heroine. But even those attributes could not hide the flaws in the script: a basic bodice-ripper, along with the sensation of it being an unsuccessful knockoff of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey; complete with secret passage and cobwebs.

6208348,1,B00HUAGZ34,"Meh, I wasn't expecting a mystery/crime movie but was open minded.  Unfortunately, it is easy to figure out the entire plot line and what will happen by the end of the first quarter of the movie.  And there were a lot of holes in the story as well, like why doesn't anyone come visit them?  Don't either the Lord or Lady have friends or relatives?  Why aren't there more servants?  Also, for a house that size there would have been deliverymen showing up every day. The Jane storyline was nonsensical. I ended up fast forwarding near the end just to see who lives and who dies.

6208423,5,B00HUAGZ34,"I was pleasantly surprised to come across this title as I was browsing Amazon for period dramas. I am a great fan of British period dramas and have watched so many yet I do occasionally chance upon an unfamiliar title. ""The Making of a Lady"" is a well-made Gothic drama with lush cinematography and a beautiful score. The ensemble cast does an excellent job as well making this well worth multiple viewings.

Lydia Wilson plays the impoverished yet educated Emily Seton, who works as a temporary secretary for a rich woman, Lady Maria Byrne (Joanna Lumley). Lady Byrne wishes to see her widowed nephew, Lord James Walderhurst (Lionel Roache) re-married and parades a string of American heiresses in front of him. Yet it is slight and pretty Emily that draws Lord Walderhurt's attention and he proposes to her. Emily is initially reluctant as she wishes to marry for love, despite her impoverished circumstances. Nevertheless, she is persuaded to accept and finds herself installed as the new Lady Walderhurst in the secluded Walderhurst estate in the English countryside.

The strong chemistry between the two leads makes the romance subplot credible - Emily blossoms into a woman and the newlyweds find themselves discovering each other in tender and romantic ways. However, Walderhurst is called away to India to rejoin his regiment during the period of the Indian Mutiny, leaving hapless Emily alone in a strange new home, run by servants who though loyal to Lord Walderhurst, seem to consider Emily as nothing but an interloper. Then Walderhurst's cousin, the disgraced Captain Alec Osbourn (James D'Arcy) and his Indian wife come to visit, claiming Walderhurst wanted them to check in on Emily. The lonely Emily welcomes them to stay but things don't quite go as expected and take a turn for the worse.

The Gothic suspense in this film is well-done, with the right amount of pacing that made me hold my breath in many scenes. Lydia Wilson is amazing in portraying a helpless and rather naive young woman who yearns to be a proper lady, yet finds herself the victim of a heinous plot. The suspense is maintained throughout, almost till the end, and provided for a riveting evening's entertainment. I plan to get the DVD to add to my period drama collection.",1425859200,,2262,4.9317585301837275

Suddenly however, Lord Walderhurst must return to India and Emily is left alone with the cold and aloof household staff.  From there on things turn dark and a promising film begins to make little logical sense.  As menace increases, Emily, despite her apparent intelligence, seems quite unable to to recognize the danger, to the point that it stretches credibility..The last part of the film seems rushed, with a just-in-time series of events at the end that seem too good to be true.

6208450,5,B00HUAGZ34,"I was astonished that this drama was taken from a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett who of course wrote ""Little Lord Fauntleroy and ""A little princess.""The making of a lady"" seems so totally out of character for her but the proof is in the pudding. I was also surprised at the number of negative reviews for this PBS film. Personally, I loved it! The photography is gorgeous, especially the majestic trees which have probably been around since William the Conqueror; the splendid white horses; the sumptuousness of the mansion's interiors and of course the costumes.

The cast is perfect, heroine Emily (Lydia Wilson)  with her piquant face and melting brown eyes, is spunky and charismatic. Sir James Walderhurst played by Linus Roache is a rather unusual aristocrat in that he seems almost shy, almost embarrassed that he has married Emily, after having his arm twisted by his aunt to beget an heir. He is very likeable. James d'Arcy makes a fine villain with his cruel little eyes and Hasina Haque as his Indian wife is the arch-hypocrite in pretending to be Emily's staunch friend. Creepy as all get-out is the Indian servant Ameerah played by Souad Faress (born in Ghana). The arsitocratic Aunt (Joanna Lumley) who pushed her nephew Sir James into marriage is right at home portraying the landed gentry. Interestingly, she was born in India. The supporting actors are excellent, too, including the snotty butler and Emily's courageous maid, Jane.

There is plenty of suspense in the film and although other reviewers found ""Lady""  languid, I found it scary at times, interesting and truly  Gothic in spirit.",1418256000,,1611,4.973977695167286

6208458,4,B00HUAGZ34,"This movie was adapted from a book by Frances Hodgson Burnett, who also wrote The Secret Garden.  The story is Gothic to the core and even reminds me a little of Rebecca, a Daphne Du Maurier mystery.

The story involves a young woman who is employed by an aristocratic woman as her personal secretary only to be let go with no employment in sight.  Enter the lady's nephew, a nobleman in his own right who is looking for a wife, nothing romantic just someone to keep him company and hopefully if all goes well produce an heir.  Secretly he really likes her and eventually she likes him too, and it's a match made in heaven!  At least for awhile until he has to leave for India leaving her alone in the huge pile of a mansion for her to run complete with butler, cook, and maid.

All of this serenity and loneliness is interrupted by an errant relative and his exotic wife.  An invitation to lunch becomes a long stay with no end in sight and much misadventure involving a death and the exit of most of the help!  They're scared!  Who wouldn't be?  This is the kind of movie that puts you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next and where and when any help will arrive.  After all this is one of these huge estates out in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors.

6208519,3,B00HUAGZ34,"This is an enjoyable little film about a young working woman who marries up to become referred to as ""your ladyship"".  She does not marry for love, but simply because it seems like the smart thing to do, but she soon starts to have feelings for her new husband.  As soon as he leaves for India his brother and his brother's wife come to stay.  The script seems awfully chopped up as if too many scenes were removed.

- Spoilers:  For example the brother in law somehow gets the new lady's maid in his clutches even though she kind of feared him.  She becomes loyal to him just as quickly and unexplainably as she decides to break that loyalty.  It's strange that her new husband would leave without really warning her about his brother since he clearly didn't trust him.  And yet when he finally returns home he doesn't seem to question the safety of Emily or the estate despite the fact that he obviously knew something about his brother's history.  Emily doesn't look more than 17 so I could believe it possible that in her lonliness she was too naive to distrust her guest. I myself grew up in a sheltered environment and I paid the price for that when I went into the real world at 18 and ended up trusting everyone...including people so obviously untrustworthy that most 9 year olds would've known better to stay away from.  But from her description of her growing up I wasn't sure her background was sheltered enough for her to be this way.  And it was hard to believe that after Alex manhandles her the way he does she still ends up allowing him to stay and trusting him.  Some of the staff members seem to be upfront with her enough to speak their mind at times, but they never tell her about Alex being a psychopath?  The feverish bouts that Alex suffers are never really explained.  Also I spent the better part of the movie believing that the guy's first wife was murdered by Alex and died under suspicious circumstances...but instead we find out that it was just a coincidence.  Lame.  I think the script was lacking, but a fun watch.",1405641600,,2046,4.474393530997305

There is absolutely no racism in the film.  The cast includes two female Indian characters and the white husband of one of them who conjure up a plot to gain his cousin's estate. It was not uncommon for white British soldiers to marry Indian women during the period depicted.  There are no derogatory inferences, no overt or covert references to the race or ethnicity of the two women. Emily, the ''Lady'' in the film, is exceptionally kind and gracious toward her visitors until she catches on to the scheme the trio has planned.

6208553,2,B00HUAGZ34,"""The Making if a Lady"" is a well-acted, visually handsome movie that manages to take a weak story and make it even weaker.

I happened to read the rather obscure books this TV movie was based on, ""The Making of a Marchioness"" and ""The Methods of Lady Walderhurst"" by Frances Hodgson Burnett (best known as the author of ""The Secret Garden"") when the Kindle edition was published.  The first was a rather touching rags-to-riches character study, something like Burnett's ""A Little Princess"" but about an adult woman instead of a child. The protagonist, Emily Fox-Seton, is well-educated and of a good family, with excellent manners and inexhaustible energy, but is kept from absolute destitution only by running errands for rich ladies. The book tracks her life up to the point when she marries her employer's wealthy but stodgy nephew, a much longer process than it seems in the TV movie (where it barely takes up the first 15 minutes). The book (only a slim novella) is actually a remarkably stark look at genteel female poverty in Victorian England.

The second book, an unneeded sequel if ever there was one, takes up Emily's life after her marriage. It is a melodramatic thriller that traces how Emily's kindness to her new husband's heir and his Indian wife are repaid with deceit and attempted murder. It is  quite racist. In the end, Emily Fox-Seton manages to outwit the nefarious Asians  and produces her own son to inherit the estate.

""The Methods of Lady Walderhurst"" is a mediocre book, but the TV movie manages to be even worse by eliminating the strength of character that makes Emily Fox-Seton a heroine rather than a victim. In the book, she manages to elude her foes by outwitting them: she takes refuge with lowborn but loyal friends from her impoverished past and then relies on the 19th century stereotype of the hysterical female invalid to stay safe until her husband returns and her baby is born. It's a lot of hooey, but it is more original than the damsel-in-distress plot that the TV movie writers came up with.

One final quibble: Frances Hodgson Burnett is very clear about the body type and personality of Emily Fox-Seton. She is a large-framed, shapely woman, rather cow-like actually, with a bovine air of serenity. The actress in the TV movie was not a bad performer, but she was definitely petite, even waif-like, and fluttery rather than tranquil. Not what the author had in mind ... but then, big women don't get to star in movies, even on TV.",1403568000,8,2479,4.77803738317757

6208555,2,B00HUAGZ34,"Set in late-1800s England, The Making of a Lady is the story of a well-born but penniless young woman who enters into a marriage of convenience with an older titled gentleman.  Things seem headed toward a Cinderella ending when his lordship is recalled to his regiment in India, leaving his bride to the mercies of aloof servants and dastardly relatives.  As usual with British costume dramas, the production values and performances are first rate.  The problem with this show is its plot, a mash-up of elements of the modern Gothic romance and Victorian sensation novel.  The thoroughly predictable story, which flies along at a breakneck pace, is riddled with clichs from both genres.  I saw this on PBS, so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD or Amazon's stream.  Recommended only if you've got ninety minutes to expend on unintentionally camp escapism.",1402617600,4,862,4.951388888888889

Also, acting, and script were predominate,  Some scenes in the film with a sexual nature were in excellent taste, and left much to the individuals imagination.

6208571,5,B00HUAGZ34,"Aside from seeing the movie, Ive also read the books (The Making of a Marchioness & The Methods of Lady Walderhurst).  Both the movie and the books are different from one another but both excellent versions on their own.  They both follow the same format in that the first parts of the story are the romantic part of the tale and the second part is the gothic portion.  The book provides a glimpse into Victorian society and marriage.  It is a world which is hard for someone living in modern times to even understand as we do not have the same societal boundaries and norms as back then.  Wonderfully written though in the book Lord Walderhurst is portrayed as being a bit stiff and Emily is noted as always wanting to please and be in admiration of kind people but she is not exceptionally bright.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as well.  The movie allows us to see how Emilys blessing of being an independent woman is also a burden in that she has to constantly work to maintain her situation.  Emily and Lord Walderhurst are played beautifully by Lydia Wilson and Linus Roache; they have wonderful chemistry onscreen and we are allowed to see how from a marriage of mutual benefit they grow to enjoy one and (yes) love one another.  The second part of the movie is gothic in that there is a plot for Lord Walderhursts cousin (with his wife and her servant)  to usurp the house, titles, etc.  by plotting to harm a pregnant Emily while the Lord is away in India.  Linus Roache does an fantastic job of portraying Lord Walderhurst in that he is the proper British gentleman but is able to show via his expressions and actions his depth of feeling for Emily without saying a word (he does finally verbalize this towards the end of the movie).  I think that by Hollywood standards he is an underrated actor and would love to see him in more movies as a leading man.  Lydia Wilson is great as Emily portraying a younger (I think 20 years is the age difference) independent woman who accepts the marriage proposal  at first for benefit but then later grows to love her husband.  James Darcy gives a very notable performance as the menacing, plotting cousin.  Read the books and enjoy the movieboth are fabulous!",1398038400,12,2210,4.540404040404041
6208587,1,B00HUAGZ34,"Started out interesting in a Downton (props, sets) sort of way for about 20 minutes then it became a long drawn out, predictable family inheritance squabble that was tedious; then it turned into some not believable mystery murder script that was even more predictable to the point of laughable. Script was disjointed with lots of gaping holes leaving events unexplained as we jumped from scene to scene. Even the ending felt like an incomplete mishmash. Cases in point; two important characters are murdered and we are shown nothing during or immediately after either event and only a little prior to one. To top it off two people are caught in the act of trying to kill a character and their punishment (also never shown) is to be deported. Sure! Not likely. Anyway, over acted; poorly directed; even more poorly written.

In reference to Downton some may think that this film's changing the time period, locality and a few superficialities saves it from borrowing the Downton feel so I present an analogous situation of Apple's iPhone and/or iPad and Samsung's introduction of similar products a year or so later. Samsung's changing a few details does not excuse it from ripping off the Apple's novel and creative idea and design feel. Yes, borrowing has always existed in human culture but there is a point where it is no longer borrowing.",1397520000,6,1342,4.885964912280702
6208588,4,B00HUAGZ34,"""The Making of a Lady"" is anything but a tidy, tea-party drama. As the title implies, you might expect a stuffy, strait-laced tale of manners. Instead, it can be described as a disturbing tale of suspense wrapped in uncertainty. Think Jane Eyre with a dark, Dickensian flavor. If that titillates your fancy, I can assure you that its Victorian visuals will satiate your voyeuristic desires. It's lushly filmed, accompanied by a subtle, yet beautiful score, and very well-acted. Lydia Wilson portrays our heroine, Emily, as delicate, thoughtful, and naive with spot-on expressions. Linus Roache dutifully portrays his character, James, with a steady determination. He gradually expresses a softness one wouldn't expect from such a stiff exterior. The on-screen chemistry between them is to be absolutely envied. Their co-stars give an equally satisfying performance in keeping the viewer guessing. While it's a bit over-the-top in a gothic sense, you might just find yourself helplessly nailed to your seat. Oh, the wickedness that awaits you!",1392768000,44,1042,5.398773006134969
6208589,3,B00HUAGZ34,"Right, this is for those out there who love the book and are wondering if they will like this, if they even ought to watch it, a just-so-you-know review
If you have your heart set on a faithful adaptation-don't watch.  If you expect it to bear no more than a vague resemblance to the book, by all means watch, it's not bad, I would give it three and a half if we could give half stars. I rounded down because it was so completely different from the book.  While it may not fair, the fact is I read the book, and I very much liked the book.  If I had not read the book I would have enjoyed the movie more, but as I did read it, it is impossible for  me to judge the movie solely on it's own merits.  I do suspect, though, the original Emily is too passive a heroine for the modern palate.
If you want to hear some of the differences from the book read on, if not stop reading.
I did say book, not books, it is primarily an adaptation of the Methods of Lady Walderhurst:The Making of a Marchioness is disposed of in the first 10 minutes. The august trip to the country with Lady Maria is trimmed down to a single dinner party where Lady Agatha has 1-2 seconds of screen time,  Miss Cora Brooke is simply ""that American girl"" quite unseen and Mrs Ralph isn't in it at all. Obviously there is no fete. Lady Maria isn't amused by anything, least of all Emily's engagement.  Emily doesn't move in with Lady Maria after the proposal, nor does she take Jane as a maid until after Walderhurst has left for India. Oh yes, and the boarding house is much worse than in the book, holes in the wall, not a scrap of turkey red, and Jane is just another lodger, her mother isn't in it.  On to Lady Walderhurst.  Palstry is  in the middle of nowhere with a bare handful of surly servants. Emily does  not invite the Osbornes to move into Kennel Farm. The Kennel farm is a wreck and remains so. The Osbornes are not on leave, Hester is not pregnant. There is no Faustine, no proposed riding lessons.  No near miss on the stairs.  No near miss with the little bridge.  Jane is not suspicious of Ameerah or the Osbornes, but Emily is. Hester does not overhear plans in the night. Hester does not warn Emily, nor do much to protect her.  And the statement in the book ""nothing will be done that can be proved"", that is out the window as well.  There is no servant girl who's no better than she should be to tell us what the milk is for, nor does the stuff work as immediately or severely.  There is no escape to Mortimer street, no kindly though puzzled Dr., nor does Walderhurst sicken. Osborn does not return to his regiment. Emily does not nearly die after the child is born. Osborn does not meet with his ""accident"", nor does Hester return with her child.
It is a completely different adventure, a wilder ride in a some respects.  It's not bad, but it's not like the book, so don't expect anything to be the same.",1392249600,3,2896,4.234545454545454
6208590,4,B00HUAGZ34,"I really liked the film, but it is all the more understandable if one has read the books, The Making of a Marchioness and The Methods of Lady Walderhurst.  The racism that some mention was actually minimized compared to the original story.  Remember the novels were written in a different time in history.  I do wish the producers had allowed for a longer series so that more of the original story could have been used, but given the time allotted, I believe they did a good job.  In the original story, Lord Walderhurst observed and talked to Emily for several days before proposing.  This story is greatly changed from the original, but the intrigue is still there, as is the romance.  The casting was excellent.",1392163200,3,714,4.672

I seriously could not look away because it was all happening so fast. I've never been so on edge during a movie! Definitely memorable - definitely worth watching!,1391990400,11,464,4.602409638554217
6208593,4,B00HUAGZ34,"""The Making of a Lady"" was made for British television in 2012, based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1901 novel ""The Making of a Marchioness."" Mrs. Burnett is more famous for her children's stories, including ""The Secret Garden"". This is a formulaic woman-in-peril plot. Emily Fox Seton (Lydia Wilson), a young woman of good birth but impoverished circumstances, works as a companion to Lady Maria Byrne (Joanna Lumley), a woman very conscious of the family's imperiled legacy if her widower nephew Lord James Walderhurst (Linus Roache) does not remarry and produce an heir. Though not the wife his aunt intended, Lord Walderhurst is taken with Jane and proposes that she marry him in a mutually beneficial arrangement. But Lord Walderhurst's cousin, the family's black sheep, Capt. Alec Osborn (James D'Arcy) is a deadly threat to everyone's plans.

This is a completely typical 19th century woman-in-peril plot, involving a bright, intelligent, but poor young woman who marries well but finds evil lurking in the shadows of her dark, imposing country home. The paint-by-numbers plot is elevated by an excellent cast and deft direction, though. Lydia Wilson's Emily is lovely, practical, and sympathetic. James D'Arcy deserves the most credit for a genuinely threatening villain that makes even jaded 21st century audiences feel uneasy. The narrative revolves around these two characters, and the film's success depends upon their ability to suck the audience into their emotions in spite of the facts that Emily seems a bit slow on the uptake and we know how it will all turn out. These novels all turn out the same. Director Richard Curson Smith succeeds, with the help of a good script by Kate Brook and a perfect cast.",1391990400,9,1721,5.124555160142349
6208594,4,B00HUAGZ34,"If you like a bit of Gothic darkness, this British adaptation of one of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works might be a diverting romp for you. It starts out placidly enough. A demure and quietly pretty Emily (Lydia Wilson) hopes to secure a full-time position as secretary to a Lady Maria (Joanne Lumley). She is living in a poor rooming house, but manages to conduct herself with some class and style. Enough style and decorum to catch the eye of Lady Maria's widowed nephew, Lord James Walderhurst (Linus Roache), who needs a wife and heir. After disastrous episodes of meeting young women his aunt trots out for him, he asks Emily if she would consent to be his wife. Emily resists at first, saying she hopes to marry for love. What about security? he asks. Security is something, and the Lord promises to be easy to live with.

After agreeing to a marriage of convenience which appears like it may grow into love, Lord James Walderhurst finds he must suddenly leave England to lead his regiment in India. Now the twists begin to twist. Some relatives arrive to the Lord's remote house ostensibly to look after Emily per the Lord's request. But do they have macabre motives? It's a bit Jane Eyreish and sinister Gothicness rolled into one which now flavors the story. These relatives are creepy.

What keeps you watching, besides the fabulous rooms, fashions and actors, is Emily who has a quiet radiance and charm. You want to see her thrive and find happiness. All sorts of sinister events occur, and Emily appears to be in danger. If you enjoy melodramatic, Gothic little romps set in the late 1800's, this is a fun escape. It's a diverting 90 minutes of old-fashioned fun and fear. Look forward to see the actress who plays Emily in future work. 3.5 stars",1391904000,143,1758,4.686084142394822
6208595,4,B00HUAGZ34,"This is an overwhelmingly Gothic tale of a British Army officer and lord who asks a young secretary to marry him the day after they first meet. She is lovely and intelligent and he is handsome, quiet, and wealthy. She agrees because she just lost her job and he promises her security and a quiet life. The officer's promises are initially true. This is all very strange but as the drama develops things become less secure and quiet.

The new lady finds that she loves the officer, but does he love her? They finally consummate the marriage after some weeks, but he is called to India and suddenly leaves her. That's when his brother and his Indian wife move in. The lady asks her best friend to be her lady's maid and the brother's mother-in-law joins them. Strange and unexpected things happen. The lady finds that she is pregnant. The mother-in-law is preparing milk concoctions for the lady every night. Things happen to the house servants. The lady is obliged to enter a lake and release a horse attached to a carriage that has fallen into the lake. Her best friend begins to act strangely. The Indian mother-in-law keeps bringing the milk concoctions to the lady every night but she stops drinking them.

Then events become more sinister and quickly reach their climax. The entire story seems rushed and foreshortened. Obviously 1:20 is not enough time to tell this story. That's the time of the movie as shown on PBS. Yes, the product details show a running time of 1:36 so perhaps I missed something, but that's typical of PBS, which needs the extra 10 minutes for commercials. So were 16 minutes really cut for the television broadcast? I assume they were.

The acting was of course excellent and the made-for-drama music matched the scenes: happiness, uncertainty, malevolence, impending danger, etc. You didn't have to listen to the dialog or even watch the screen to know what was happening. This short Gothic melodrama was interesting but no Masterpiece Theater equal to the dramatized great classic novels we are familiar with from BBC that are given the time to tell their story. I enjoyed it but events moved too quickly. More time was needed for character development and for giving the viewer some time to reflect.

However, the story takes on such a cheesy turn after Alec and Hester arrived; they were eyeing each other so obviously with malice, and the Lyttons were so desperate to act mean with no reason that I can't stand Emily playing stupid anymore.
