I liked Pooja's honesty, because right now its a gimmick to try to be modern. Pooja was Pooja. I respect Madhuri because she was the ideal woman, she is the women all women aspire to be: the dutiful daughter-loyal wife-and the ideal mother. They are both very similar than different and this reflects in their upbringing: Pooja had lots of freedom of expression, and Madhuri expressed her creativity through art and dance.",1304467200,,548,4.778947368421052
