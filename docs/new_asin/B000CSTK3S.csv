2473882,4,B000CSTK3S,"After releasing a horde of single disc releases containing various episodes, Warner Bros. has finally released the complete set of the first season of the Justice League.  In the first season, DC Comics icons Superman, Batman (once again voiced by the great Kevin Conroy), Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and the Martian Manhunter unite to take on evil, and the storylines throughout the first season are simple in terms of plot and story.  In fact, there is quite a bit that winds up being cliche (but not Superfriends-ish) and the animation is stiff, but the good outweighs the bad.  Throughout the season, the heroes are spotlighted, including the origin of the Martian Manhunter and his coming to Earth, a tragic past event for Green Lantern John Stewart, and the uneasy relationship between Superman and Batman.  Towards the end of the season, both Supes' and Bat's arch nemesis' Lex Luthor and the Joker (both are voiced again by Clancy Brown and Mark Hamil respectively) team together with an assortment of villains to take on the League, which is worth seeing alone for fans of the DC characters.  Though the series would get better as it would go on (especially it's third season, where it was re-titled Justice League Unlimited and featured a revolving cast of DC heroes), the Justice League animated series is yet another highly enjoyable animated show from the Warner Bros./DC stable.",1136678400,6,1414,5.0
2473883,5,B000CSTK3S,"March 2006 is starting to become my favorite month.  Already I've learned there's going to be DBZ movie 12, Kingdom Hearts 2, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Batman Beyond season 1, and Robot Chicken season 1.  Now that I've learned that season 1 of Justice League is slated for this month as well, I've become one incredibly happy person.

Batman is once again voiced by the excellent Kevin Conroy, who to this day is still doing the dark knight's voice for a total of 13 years since Batman: TAS(and counting).  What can I say?  He IS Batman.  Conroy, as expected, once again shines, capturing the perfect, dark, raspy, and sometimes sarcastic voice you'd expect Batman to use.  The others, which include Carl Lumby as the Martian Manhunter, Phil LaMaar as Green Lantern, Micheal Rosenbaum as Flash, Maria Canals as Hawkgirl, and Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, are also excellent and pefect as their respective characters.  However, George Newbern starts off a bit weak taking over the Superman reign from Tim Daly, though thankfully he gets better at it as the season progresses.

My personal favorites include In Blackest Night, which is a good Green Lantern-centered storyarc and really turned me into a fan of him.  Another is Paradise Lost, where Wonder Woman returns to her home, only to find everyone turned to stone by a sorceror(voiced by Freddy Kruger himself, Robert Englund), who wishes to free the demented Lord Hades(voiced by John Rhys-Daves, aka Gimli of the LOTR trilogy).  Another known as a Knight of Shadows features the return of Etrigan from the New Batman Adventures, wishing to stop Morgan Le Fey from taking over the world.  The only prolem is she has taken over the Martian Manhunter's mind, and tricked him into thinking that she can reunite him with his fellow Martians.  Uh oh.

My personal favorite though is Injustice for All, which is where a dying Lex Luthor, who has finally been exposed for the criminal he really is, escapes prison and forms a gang of criminals, such as Cheetah, the Joker, Soloman Grundy, and the Shade, to destroy the Justice League.  The highlight in this is of course seeing(hearing?) Clancy Brown and Mark Hamill once again take up the reigns of Luthor and the Joker, respectively, from the previous DC shows.

If there is one complaint, it's that the writing doesn't reach its peak until the next season, but that is a minor qualm.  This season is still a very fun watch, and the 12 storyarcs and 26 episodes that the DVD set contains are more than enough to keep me satisfied.

PS to Warner Bros.:  You're doing great with your Hanna-Barbera and DCAU DVD sets.  Now just release the Steven Spielberg toons(Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, Freakazoid) and I will be forever grateful.",1136419200,19,2740,4.864224137931035
2473884,5,B000CSTK3S,"High above the Earth in the great Watchtower of the Justice League, there are assembled the world's seven greatest heroes created from the cosmic legends of the universe - Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, the Flash, Green Lantern, the Martian Manhunter, Hawkgirl. Their mission: To fight injustice, to right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind.

It was planetary pandemonium for animation fans when the creators of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" unveiled the monster hit series ""Justice League"" back in 2001. Taking the premise of Hanna-Barbera's classic ""Superfriends"" [of uniting heroes to fight evil on a global scale as originally done in the comic books] and giving it a 21st century upgrade, the show's producers boldly took the time to flesh out the members of the League, adding a depth to what motivates them as heroes. This was never done with the Justice League of the 60s, 70s & 80s. Justice League featured Emmy-worthy production values in animated storytelling and brilliant thought and care in voice casting. Not to mention a magnificent main title theme by Lolita Ritmanis. Given the show's mature tone, fans were dumbfounded that DVDs of Justice League were only released as single disc ""DC Comics Kids Collection"" volumes with no more than 3-4 eps instead of season sets. (Note: If you own all of the original JL volumes then you already have Justice League - Season One episodes 1-15, and should consider the remaining 11 episodes plus the exclusive EXTRAS on this set before deciding.)

It only took 'em FOUR years (since the first JL volume released), but Warner Home Video will finally release the LONG-AWAITED Justice League - Season One DVD on March 21st! This 4-disc (575 min.) set features all 26 episodes (multi-part arcs);  Full-Frame (1.33:1) video (fans campaigned to WHV for this format with following seasons to be in widescreen as originally animated); English audio; and English, Spanish, French subtitles. Here are the contents of this extraordinary set:

2473885,5,B000CSTK3S,"I wish I could rate this DVD higher than five stars, because a show like `Justice League' goes far beyond any television show and I am not just referring to cartoons. The masters of comic book animation, Bruce Timm and company put their heads together and said...""Hey Batman and Superman worked, lets make a new show with more heroes in it."" `Justice League is nothing like The Superfriends of the `70's. It is a dramatic action packed masterpiece.

The high point of this DVD is that expands the DC universe. For me, being mostly a Marvel comic reader, this show really got me familiar with the DC universe and I love it. There are some loyal fans that are disappointed with the fact this animated team is not composed of the original seven:
Superman
Batman
Wonder Woman
Aqua Man
The Flash
Martian Man-hunter
Green Lantern
Please, when has Bruce Timm and company disappointed us? The first season fills all the gaps with a great Aqua Man story. Hawkgirl is great for the show because she has a wild side that really gives Wonder Woman a run for her money. And what does more heroes mean?...Why more villains of course! The episode `Injustice for All' is my favorite episode of this first season, because it really sets the stage for what is yet to come in the next few seasons. I am not going to reveal anything, but all I can say is you will not be disappointed.

Justice League is a must have for hard-core comic readers to fans of `Batman: The Animated series. It has surely stood the test of time being that it is in the middle of its 5th season and it just might be the best show on Television.",1135123200,14,1600,4.4573378839590445
2473886,5,B000CSTK3S,"Here's another ""thank you"" going out to WB for FINALLY releasing this set. I do agree with the other reviewer, who said that the better episodes tend to be in the later (current) seasons, but this is a heck of a start!!!!",1135036800,8,221,4.285714285714286
2473887,4,B000CSTK3S,"I'm thrilled. After multiple single-disc releases, Warner Home Video has finally decided to collect all the Justice League season 1 episodes in one set. This is the original series with the main 7 heroes, not the ""Unlimited"" incarnation it became last year. The stories are all two-part adventures, with two three-part epics book-ending the season. We get the following:

Secret Origins (3 parts)

In Blackest Night (2 parts)

The Enemy Below (2 parts)

Injustice For All (2 parts)

Paradise Lost (2 parts)

War World (2 parts)

Brave and the Bold (2 parts)

Fury (2 parts)

Legends (2 parts)

A Knight of Shadows (2 parts)

Metamorphosis (2 parts)

The Savage Time (3 parts)

In retrospect, most of the first season stories are pretty bland compared to what we're getting today. The writing is cliche, the stories are basic, and the animation is stiff and questionable in places. However once you account for the growing pains of any series, there's some fun material here. J'onn J'onzz, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman get spotlighted and developed this season. Etrigan, Aquaman, and Metamorpho guest star, and tons of new enemies from all over the DC universe make their appearance. The first season is if anything, a homage to the simpler story telling of the comic book silver age. The stories get more dramatic and powerful as the season progresses, and the love and respect the creators have for their material really shines through. Plus even at its worst, Justice League is still better than most of the shows kids are subjected to these days.

This set will come with 3 commentaries, interviews, and *possibly* rehash some of the featurettes from the single disc releases. It will be the only fullscreen release of the series, as that is the way it was actually animated. Future seasons have been confirmed for widescreen. Start saving up, and prepare to relive the Justice League's earliest adventures.",1135036800,80,1913,4.9748427672955975
2473888,5,B000CSTK3S,"It is a shame that Bruce Timm's DCAU is coming to an end.  With Cartoon Network's lack of interest in superheroes (by this I mean the cancellation of Teen Titans) it would be no suprise if Justice League Unlimited was next.  The great thing about Justice League is that in combines all the DCAU (Batman, Superman, Static Shock, The Zeta Project, and Batman Beyond) into a nice package and delivers all the best of each.  It is sad to see such a huge story like this come to an end. Thank god we can now watch them over and over with the DVD's.  Hopefully Static Shock and The Zeta Project are not far behind.",1134864000,8,608,4.307017543859649

2473891,5,B000CSTK3S,"Some of these heroes have been around since before most of us were born, no matter how old we are. Therefore if you aren't familiar with the characters of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (etc.) you either didn't like comic books much as a kid, or you were exclusively a Marvel fan. LOL

This series is a visual delight on blu ray. The stories are interesting to fans of all ages. My wife and I enjoy them, our son and daughter-in-law enjoy them, and our grand-daughter enjoys them. To find entertainment like that to apply to one sitting of three generations is priceless.

The stories themselves are quite captivating, and when they come as a series of connected episodes, you'll have a hard time breaking in the middle of the sequence. There are quite a variety of superheroes spread amongst the episodes, and although you'll see the ""name"" heroes most often, there are always some interesting minor heroes sprinkled in ... either in combination with the big names, or sometimes featured in their own stories. You'll also find that not all of the heroes ""get along"". Rivalries and disputes are common, and add even more depth to the episodes.

If you were/are a DC Comics fan, or wish to become one, you can buy this set of Blu ray discs with confidence.",1508976000,,1270,4.686098654708521

The following episodes has a nice assortment of 2 part episodes.  The Man Hunters vs the Green Lanterns.  The league teaming with Aqua Man to battle rogue Atlantians.  The sorcerer attacking the amazons, and Wonder Woman breaking Amazon Law by bringing Men there to save them.  Superman is abducted and forced into Gladiatorial Combat.  Grodd is introduced and Gorilla City is also.  A rogue Amazon tries to exterminate all Males on Earth.  Several League members are blasted into another dimension.  Lex Luthor organizes several Super  Villains into an Injustice League.  The League joins with Etrigan the Demon to battle Morgan Le Fay's.  Metamorpho is born and helps the League battle his creator.

The final episode has the League time travelling to WWII, where Vandal Savage has usurped Hitler.  That's my favorite episode.  The League defeats Vandal, but not the Nazis.

While I see many differences in characters, some of them are the same.
Here's my comparison from what I've seen so far:
Superman - same character, but since when has he become a wimp? He has to wear a mask when going underwater, and he seems to get injured easily.
Batman - same character. Smart and never seems to change.
Wonder Woman - She can fly now? Back in my day she flew around in an invisible plane! The magic lasso remains the same.
Martian Manhunter - He is now a shape shifter (he wasn't back in the Silver comic days...in fact he was just as powerful as the man of steel, except he was weakened by fire).
Green Lantern - I realize they change GL's over the years, but HAL JORDAN to me is the ULTIMATE GL.
Hawkgirl - Appears to be a member, but in the past it was HawkMAN that was the member.
Flash - Always fast, but definitely cockier nowadays.
And whatever happened to the GREEN ARROW and the ATOM?
Aquaman was also an original member of the JLA, as was Snapper Carr for some reason.
So what characters are going to be used in the upcoming JLA movie? And why is Lois Lane even IN the movie?",1443312000,2,1260,4.210743801652892

They did not seem scratched and so far are playing all right. Justice League Unlimited 1 was the same. Luckily I have empty 'real' cases to move them to. With all this wonderful art work, I would think they would care about the discs inside. Having come late to the DC world, I was glad to get the history of some of these characters, such as the Martian and Wonder Woman. These episodes whiz by, but its too bad you have to put up with the 'last time on Justice League' recaps and the intro and credits - these take up a good portion of what was probably supposed to be a half hour TV show.

This series, while about the Justice League as a whole, would rotate it's focus on the characters and how they interacted with each other, and situations they were placed in, assuring that the focus never became about only one character throughout the series.  The stories are done in usually two part episodes, allowing for time and pacing.  This is done because the things that bring these heroes together are usually large in scale and nature, and the show allows for the tales to develop organically, not feeling rushed.

The animation is solid, albeit, not a style I'm particularly fond of.  However that's just a matter of preference of mine, and most will be fine with it.  In hi-def, one worries about how shows look when rose-colored glasses are forced to be removed.  I can honestly say that the animation holds up quite well.  The colors are solid, and the animation still looks smooth.

If you're a fan of DC Comics and want to see what else they have in other entertainment formats, you'll do well to start with series like Justice League.",1421798400,6,1152,4.691542288557214

The stories feature a variety of classic comic book villains and heroes, all represented in stunning HD in this Blu-ray set. I really can't recommend it highly enough.

I am very pleased with the blue ray discs and find a whole new enjoyment in the episodes I already know and love.
For those of you who have not watched the Justice League series before here is a brief glimpse off all that you have missed.  Justice League season one shows the creation of the Justice League with Batman, Superman, Wonder-woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawk-girl and Martian Manhunter.  This season follows the characters as they learn to trust each other and work as a team. The league is challenged by alien invaders and the well known villains of earth who struggle to out do the League and unite against the joint forces of these powerful super heroes.",1323129600,4,1133,4.449275362318841

2474158,3,B000CSTK3S,"Warner Brothers DVDs have a habit of starting the movie after cycling through the main menu one or two times. This is annoying. This Blu Ray one ups this annoying tendency by making it so there is no main title menu for episode selection.  Each disc starts with whatever the first episode is and plays straight through from one episode to the next.  No returning to the menu between episodes.  To select episodes, other than the first one on the disc, a pop up menu must be used.  Bonus features thankfully do have their own menu.  The disc mastering isn't just lazy and counter intuitive, it's a pain if you don't plan on watching an entire disc in one sitting!

I doubt the DVD version has this same problem. If it doesn't, it may be worth getting the series in lesser quality just to avoid the lack of proper menus.

Content wise, if you enjoy the other Bruce Timm and company Warner Brothers superhero cartoons--Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, Batman Beyond--the odds are you will get a kick out of this series. All of the leads are in someway underpowered, which will be a frustration for comic readers and die hard fans. The quality of animation and story telling is there though. It's more mature than Super Friends and is a good way of introducing non-comic readers to the Justice League.

So if you want a good copy of it and the second season then get this version of the series.

The one problem as a lot of other reviewers have stated when they re issued this on Blu ray why did't they put it on widescreen insted of leaving it as the full screen verision which looks funny on a widescreen television with the actual episode is vertically presented and the opening credits are presented in widescreen.

2474162,3,B000CSTK3S,"I was in the mood for a superhero fix, and I'd heard a lot of good things about Justice League/Justice League Unlimited, so I decided to give the first season a try.

First of all, this IS the first season of Justice League. The title changed in season three to ""Justice League Unlimited,"" which ran for two seasons of it's own. The JLU seasons also feature an expanded cast of superheros and season-long plot lines, where this season and the next ave mostly unconnected multi-part episodes featuring the seven-member Justice League: Superman, Batman, J'onn J'onzz (Martian Manhunter), Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern and Hawk Girl.

I didn't enjoy this season as much as the Batman or Superman animated series. The large cast means that you don't get a lot of development for each character, but Wonder Woman, J'onn J'onzz, Green Lantern and Hawk Girl each get some really nice scenes. The two big missteps are Superman, who gets socked every episode just to show how tough the bad guy is (making him appear to be one of the *weakest* members of the team) and Flash, who's portrayed for ""comic relief"" purposes as hotheaded, incompetent, and arrogant. What's worse, is that his powers are made to seem completely useless. They give him a blur when he moves, but he doesn't actually travel faster than any of the other characters. He has trouble chasing down a car that Superman would have caught up to in seconds, and he routinely goes from dodging bullets and lazer beams to being hit by a thrown chair he could see coming from across the room.

That said, there are some good bits. The final story, ""The Savage Time"" is one of the best bits of television I've seen, and really uses all the characters well. ""Legends"" has some very nice (if subtle) social commentary. ""Secret Origins"" is also very good.

ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: ""Injustice For All"" should be the fourth story, episodes 8 and 9, before ""Paradise Lost,"" as is is on the DVD. Instead, they moved it to episodes 18 and 19 near the end for some reason. This is unfortunate, because the only two stories this season that really reference each other are ""Injustice For All"" and ""Fury."" ""Fury"" makes slightly less sense if you see it first!",1311379200,3,2200,4.721354166666667

I originally owned this season on regular DVD but when I heard they were re-releasing it on Blu-Ray, I had to have it! It is very crisp and clear!

I used these episodes of Season One in my junior English classes to teach the conventions of the short story and heroic archetypes. My 13 year-old students loved learning through heroics. You don't have to be a 'comic geek' to recognize who these characters are and there is no need to know their histories because everything the show needs you to know is clearly explained within story contexts. I found that this is what is lacking with the Justice League Unlimited episodes, they move into more specialized characters without providing any information and within the half hour episodes it is easy to get lost - not so with Justice League Season 1&2. Most episodes are two parters which really allows for a story and its characters to develop. I wish this show was still on television, it's good clean, classic fun!",1277856000,,966,4.755952380952381

However, if you don't have it and have a blu-ray player or a PS3 then it's worth getting the Blu-ray if you find it decently priced.  For me, the Blu-ray was only about $5 more, which isn't bad considering it's a whole season.  Animation generally benefits quite a bit from high definition, and the sound is good too.  Finally, don't worry about the widescreen.  The show was originally aired in the the old 4:3 style, and almost all shows that re-air something in widescreen will alter the images rather than redraw them.  It's not a complaint by any means, it's just the way things are since it'd be too expensive and time consuming to go back and redo something like that.",1257120000,4,761,4.471014492753623

2474175,4,B000CSTK3S,"This is definitely a show intended for kids, but made with the knowledge that a number of adult fans of comics would be watching as well.  I had watched the Batman cartoon show with my daughter when she was a little girl and thought this might be worth a look.  And it most definitely was!  The animation wasn't quite cutting edge, but it was definitely far beyond what was happening with much else in American animation.  It didn't take framing and timing to the cinematic extremes of the best anime, but neither did it have the ADHD pacing of most American animated shows.

The first key to a show like this is getting the particular version of the Justice League together.  The show was made only a few years after Grant Morrison has revitalized the JLA label by pushing the lesser heroes who had come to dominate the league in the earlier part of the nineties.  Morrison had set aside the heroes whose names you couldn't quite remember.  Morrison created the team with almost nothing but the major heroes taking charge.  The TV series took the same course, starting with Superman and having Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (the John Stewart version), the Flash (thought not named, apparently the Wally West version), and, from the B list roster of heroes, Hawk Girl.  Batman declines to be an official member but is a fully active adjunct member.  And of course, one of the all-time JLA favorites, J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter (wonderfully voiced by ALIAS' Carl Lumbley).  I would have liked to see Green Arrow included (love those arrows).  One could quibble with other decisions.  Hal Jordan is clearly the main Green Lantern, but I think balancing the cast of characters racially was more than adequate justification for including John Stewart rather than Hal (Stewart is hardly a junior member of the DC universe).  I would have preferred Barry Allen over Wally West (assuming it is Wally West), but I think they wanted a ""younger"" Flash for the youth viewers.  All of this was brought to life by a really great group of voice over artists.  All the main characters were marvelously voiced as was all of the guest characters.  They did a great job of including both established voice over artists and actors not particularly known for their voice work.

The stories were good, usually extending beyond one or two episodes.  The production quality was consistently good.  The writing excellent.  My one complaint with the show -- and I can't imagine that anyone watching the show wouldn't agree with this -- is the extraordinary nerfing of several of the main characters.  In particular, Superman and Wonder Woman have been made vastly less powerful than they are usually portrayed.  Never has Superman been presented less powerfully than on this show.  He gets knocked out on a consistent basis, often is battled to a standstill by various villains, and frequently is not sufficiently strong to deal with one or another challenge.  All of them are situationally weak.

One could make all kinds of minor complaints, but I think the truth is that they do all in all a pretty good job.  I not only watched all of Season One in two days, I finished Season Two in the next two.  And JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED is next up on my Netflix queue.",1246579200,,3245,4.765232974910394
2474176,4,B000CSTK3S,"One:  Everyone here complains about one thing.  ""Where is the WIDESCREEN"", first off, I have watched the show since it first aired.  The first season was aired in widescreen during the encore showing, but it changed nothing. I don't understand the problem, why widescreen?  The product was produced in widescreen, but all they did was stretch the image a little, and cut off some of the upper and lower part of the screen.  This is done in a lot of older movies that originally aired full screen.  If you watch some of the older ""made for TV"" movies that were put into a DVD ""widescreen"", a lot of the picture is cut out.  This would have been the case for this product.  So, the widescreen argument with this release is worthless.

Two:  The picture quality is awesome, unfortunately, it also leads to problems.  For instance something that was not drawn in a background pops in all of sudden.  Like Batman's belt, and some other things that is no big deal when on regular TV broadcast, or DVD playback.  This is only because the producers didn't draw it for a Blu-Ray Release.  This should have been corrected before releasing this set and the only reason it loses a star.  This however, does not kill the Blu-Ray, being it happens rarely, but it's noticeable at times.

Three:  The Sound is really good, I can't say too much because I don't have a High Standard sound system.  I do have 5.1, and at least in my system it sounds good.

Last but not least: The show itself is awesome.  The characters are created well, and the voice acting is topnotch.  I was going to buy the DVD sets when I got back from Afghanistan, but I saw the Blu-Ray release and purchased it before I went home on leave.  I am glad I had waited, because this is truly the best way to see Justice League.
I have a PS3, and a 42In 1080P Vizio.  It runs well on this setup, I don't know why someone would have a problem, unless he/she has not read the instructions on his PS3 or TV.

 First of all I get a square letter box, I mean that in my TV it doesn't display in a real full screen, although it should. So, all that I see is an image in the center of the screen about 3"" smaller that it should be.

 The sound isn't impressive either. As other review stated: most use of the center and a few of the whole rest of speakers.

 Not really special features.

 For me, this is an average DVD and not worth the extra cost. Stick to the DVD and avoid the BD. That's a shame, because I love this series.",1236297600,4,704,3.9642857142857144
2474199,4,B000CSTK3S,"First, to address the ""lack of widescreen"" complainers - this season was originally formatted in full-frame. It later aired in widescreen on Cartoon Network because the company wanted them to match up with the later seasons that were formatted in widescreen. The end result was an image that chopped heads and legs off and looked very sloppy. Future releases for this series should include the episodes in widescreen, just like the original DVDs did.

That being said, this was a nice start to the expansion of the DCAU, though it wasn't without a few bumps in the road. Bruce Timm and the rest of the creative team have talked in interviews about their mistake of trying to de-power Superman and make him more vulnerable just to keep a level of suspense in each story. The side-effect, however, was that it made Superman look like a big wuss, so to speak. This was later rectified in later seasons of the show. Also, the Warworld episodes with Mongul were pretty bad and the team didn't have a sense of good chemistry throughout the season, but considering that this is the first show to have all of these characters teamed up with each other, it fared well considering those circumstances.

This is a great jumping-on point for fans of the DCAU that want to (but shouldn't) skip the Batman and Superman animated series'. This show only got better as the years went on.",1236211200,2,1370,4.704166666666667

2474227,4,B000CSTK3S,"Protecting the world from alien invaders, powerful sorcerers and criminal masterminds is a job too big for just one superhero. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Martian Manhunter and the Flash are seven of the world's mightiest superheroes. Together, they are the Justice League. In this collection of entertaining adventures, the Justice League faces such dangerous rogues like Lex Luthor, Felix Faust, Gorilla Grodd and Vandal Savage. Based on the popular DC Comics' characters, ""Justice League"" is another well produced animated series from the creators of the Emmy-winning ""Batman: TAS"". ""Justice League"" premiered on Cartoon Network in 2001 and became a popular hit due to the inmense popularity of the previous animated shows. The first season of ""Justice League"" features 12 multi-part episodes with likable good-versus-evil plots, refreshing characters, rousing comic book action and colorful animation. The first season is the weakest of the entire animated series but does include such standout episodes as ""The Enemy Below"", ""The Brave and the Bold"", ""Legends"", ""A Knight of Shadows"" and ""The Savage Time"".

If you already own ""Justice League: Season One"" on DVD, then you'll want to think twice before upgrading to the Blu-Ray set. Despite a strong fan outcry for the release of the first season in widescreen, Warner Bros has again disappointed us by presenting all episodes in their full screen broadcast format. On the upside, the picture quality is really good. The episodes never looked so bright and sharp. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound isn't riveting but gets the job done. The 3-disc Blu-Ray has the same bonus features from the previous DVD set: ""Inside Justice League"" panel discussion, ""The First Mission"" promo, ""The Look of the League"" and ""The Blueprint for Justice"" featurettes and audio commentaries by series creators on three episodes (The Enemy Below Pt. 2, Legends Pt. 2 & The Savage Time Pt. 2).

2474230,5,B000CSTK3S,"For a few years there was a significant effort to bring decent storytelling and characterization to the realm of animated superheroes; Justice League and its successor, along with the earlier Batman and Superman animated series, were high points of the period.  Sadly, these days we're sliding deeper into the 'oh, the humanity' and endless angst aspects.

Instead of declining into the foppish triteness of earlier efforts (Superfriends, et al), the creators made an effort to inject some measure of 'real' personality into the Leaguers, and occasionally even into the ""villains"" (though happily they did not allow the latter to get out of hand in this season).  These heroes generally would not be embarrassing to be around (maybe even kind of cool to hang with).  Likeable, generally.  So unlike the earlier Hanna-Barbera style buffoons.

If there was one down point for me, it was the excessive 'politeness' and 'correctness' of Superman.  He sounded too much like a guidance counselor at a politically correct college at first, though things improved as the season progressed.",1219968000,,1081,5.25
2474231,5,B000CSTK3S,"As a fan of the art, story and legends behind the major figures of the DC comic universe this animated series was a more than competent transition from page to screen. It was a very welcome series to enable one to see familiar characters that have already been seen in movies and tv (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash) as well as those which are just as popular on page but who may not occupy such ready familiarity outside the actual comic book medium (Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Hawkgirl). The art style is very modern and an upward evolution from the first Batman animated series circa 1990s. Themes tend to be a bit mature and not as ""sugar coated"" as in decades gone by, but this is also a positive modern enhancement for audiences who welcome a ""thinking"" storyline.",1219881600,,783,4.681159420289855
2474232,3,B000CSTK3S,"The high-res transfer for these discs is quite good.  However, the original source material was clearly not intended for a presentation at this resolution, and a lot of short cuts, rough lines, low-line-count background or distant objects, and other shortcomings show up quite blatantly.  For example, it's pretty common to clearly see a character lose eyebrows, then their nose, then the separation between their eyes as they get more distant in a single scene.  At 480i, that was not noticeable.  Here it is really obvious.

The colors are great, and the video compression is not a problem, but the audio seems pretty flat.

Of course, these are NOT widescreen, they are 4:3, as originally aired, despite the episodes being designed to be shown in 16:9.  I don't mind this so much, however, as it shows more of the environment, and my display can show these as if it were letterbox, cutting the extra and showing them as originally intended.  The presence of the extra material is not a weakness in my mind, as it makes them better viewed on non-16x9 screens (like computer monitors).  The extra resolution which a full 16x9 aspect presentation would have given would have been a complete waste, due to the low quality of the animation itself.

Also, the chapters are well placed, so it is easy to skip the horrible intro sequence, and the recurring ""last time on..."" section in more than half the episodes.  Why they didn't just link these two (or more) part episodes together, I have no idea.

All and all, it is worthy of an upgrade from the DVD version, but they could have done better if they had wanted to.  I'd give it 4 stars, but it started at only 4 due to the lower quality of these episodes, especially when compared to the early Batman: The Animated Series stuff and the later Justice League, and lost another star for the small problems with this edition itself.

Basically, I removed one star for the content, and one for the presentation.",1219536000,5,1956,4.714705882352941
2474233,3,B000CSTK3S,"I have no gripes with Warner Bros. releasing this on Blu-ray, but I do have a problem with what they put on this disc (or, I should say, what they DIDN'T put on there). First, the picture itself does look fine and is fairly crisp and clean, but why in the world was it not presented in widescreen, the preference as stated in the very first commentary by the producers??? There's no excuse for that.

Second, there is only the standard Dolby Digital 5.1 which, for those who own the SD version, is an upgrade. The audio does sound pretty good, though it didn't have the impact I expected. There's plenty of dialogue that is clear, making use of the center channel while other speakers are used for the action sequences. Not overly impressive, but a decent effort.

Third, the studio was kind enough to port over all the features but added nothing else. Given the price difference between the two versions ($25 vs. $42), and the fact they didn't bother with a widescreen transfer, they could've added couple new features. How about one on making the Blu-ray release itself? Oh, and speaking of features, adding insult to injury, one of them actually showed a couple scenes from the season in widescreen (non-anamorphic since the feature was in full frame)...

As it stands, this is an OK Blu-ray release but not a must buy IMO. Comparing it with the SD (which I also own), the picture here does seem to be brighter and clean, but is the improvement worth the cost? I'm not so sure. The only (minor) plus side is the 26 episodes are now spread across 3 discs rather than 4 and all the featurettes are on one disc.

Note: I rated this 3/5, however it is closer to a 3.5/5, I just couldn't justify giving it a 4/5.",1219276800,50,1710,4.488745980707395

I own the DVD version and am very happy with it (though the later seasons were better overall), and I plan to replace it with this Blu-ray version, if only to encourage Warner to put the rest of the series on Blu-ray.

Two main things remain to be seen:
- How good the HD video quality is. Justice League never aired in HD, so this will be a first. I hope it's better than the Avengers movies, which were full of visual artifacts.
- Whether it's presented in wide screen. This first season was produced in standard 4:3, but designed so you can cut off the top and bottom without losing anything important.

The stories are excellent, well thought out and have exciting climaxes and satisfying resolutions.  The characters are astonishingly true to their comic book personas.  The first episode features Green Arrow and they nailed his character to a tee, including a small run in the Black Canary!

The story starts out when Superman is tricked into pushing for the disarmerment of all nuclear weapons.  I especially liked the realism that he looked older than he did in the previous Superman series.  Anyway, the evil aliens that tricked him mount an attack, but by himself he isn't able to stop it.  This leads to a the founding members of the Justice League meeting and the group being forged in battle.  These heroes include Superman, the Martian, Wonderwoman, the Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawk Girl. They turn back the aliens and decide to keep their team so they can do more good in the world.

Almost every episode of this series is a two partner.  This gives the writers plenty of time to set up a good solid story and then execute it.

Time travel plot lines in Savage Time pt1-3 enable us to see The Blackhawks, Sgt Rock and Easy Co, The War Wheel, and Wonder Woman's brief interlude with Steve Trevor.

Now here's a twist. In 1981-89 Roy Thomas wrote incessantly about the Justice Society (and All-Star Squadron and Young All-stars) set forever in 1942. Not even the crisis on infinite earths' phasing out of the golden age Superman and Wonder Woman and Batman could stop Roy reinventing the golden age of comics.
To satirize this, 4 core members of the Justice League travel to a parallel universe (in JL season 1 ep ""Legends"") and meet the Justice Guild of America (whose characters are clear retoolings of the Justice Society of America). There's just one catch. Are they the real JGA or not? The key to it all is their teen mascot ""Ray Thomson"", who has kept the world in a permanent golden age, using his amazing mental powers.

He needs to wear breathing apparatus to stay under water.  He needs to wear a full spacesuit to travel in space.  He completely forgot that he has super speed - faster than a speeding bullet, and all that.  He is always out of breath after a fight, or after just lifting a heavy object.  In one episode he struggles to carry a fire engine in one hand and a fireman in the other - Wonder Woman has to help him.

Speaking of Wonder Man, she can fly.  Where's the invisible jet?  No need for it.  She's basically Superwoman with a different costume.  She's a match for Superman in strength and invulnerability.  She does block weapon's fire with her bracelets, but she doesn't really have to - she can survive being thrown through a thick concrete wall or column without suffering a single scratch.

The Flash can dodge missiles and laser blasts, but is not quick enough to step over a small rock that falls in his path.  He's always tripping over things.

Hawkgirl is about as invulnerable as Superman and Wonder Woman.

Jon J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter, constantly forgets to use his powers.  Sometimes he will let flying objects pass through him - other times he will watch an approaching threat, and just take the hit.  He never uses his invisibility, only his intangibility.  His invulnerability to all but fire is non-existent; like Superman, he gets hurt by everything.  He also suffers Superman's poor super strength.

The Green Lantern and Batman are the only superheroes that resemble the DC comic versions.

The show has good artwork and animation, so it's not a total loss.",1203465600,9,1843,4.814696485623003
2474268,4,B000CSTK3S,"The first season of Justice League is an achievement and a definite must-have for any superhero fan.  It certainly sheds the corny, clich&eacute;d writing and cheap animation of its embarrassing relative ""Superfriends.""

The disk starts out of the gate strong with an entertaining, three-part episode tracing the League's origin.  Superman confronts an overwhelming alien power and soon realizes that he can't protect the world on his own anymore.  The remaining episodes are generally well-written, certainly by animation standards, and then some.  Some fans criticized the first season for presenting an all-too human Superman, who appeared to be getting his rear-end kicked at every turn (reminiscent of Superfriends' Superman: ""oh no, this net must be made of some type of Kryptonite alloy!"")  Although it's understandable that writers wanted to give Superman some good challenges lest he dominate every battle, some fans - this one included - thought it went a bit far.

There are a few weak spots, namely ""In Darkest Night"" and ""War World,"" (the weakest of all the episodes) but these can be dismissed as but minor aggravations.  (And, on an interesting note, the featured villain in War World makes a comeback in Season 3's ""For the Man who has Everything"" - an episode which received some great reviews (and strongly based on the 1985 comic book Superman Annual #11).

The first season attempts to develop the bonds of friendship and note some of the awkward strains created when seven, very independent and powerful individuals team up together.  Former Marine Jon Stewart (Green Lantern) routinely becomes aggravated with the younger and quite immature Wally West (Flash) and frequently questions the aggressive Hawkgirl's judgment and tactics.  However, these tensions evaporate over the season, (and Jon and Hawkgirl develop a friendship that ultimately turns to romance in subsequent seasons).  The King of Atlantis (Aquaman) makes an entrance, and he is anything but Superfriendly (The Enemy Below).  Diana (Wonder Woman) learns about ""man's world,"" trusting her team members, and makes a difficult choice that results in exile from her home world of Themyscria (Paradise Lost).  ""Injustice for All"" features Lex Luthor's faltering attempts to fashion a league of villains against the JL, with Bruce Wayne (Batman) in rare form, nearly losing his life on two occasions.  Some team members think he is trying to prove his mettle, dangerously so.  And, if you look carefully, you'll see the beginnings of Bruce and Diana's growing affections for one another (The Brave and the Bold).

Each of stories are either two-part or three-part episodes, which I thought was a plus.  Look for various heroes (and enemies) to appear later down the line in subsequent seasons.",1200268800,,2776,5.2704545454545455
2474269,5,B000CSTK3S,"I grew up during the 70s when cartoons were not supposed to violent.  You never saw punches being thrown unless it was Bugs Bunny hitting Elmer over the head with a wooden mallet.  In fact, Japanese animations, such as Battle of the Planets, edited out the violent portions of the cartoon and replaced it with a robot (7-Zark-7).  I actually do have fond memories of watching the Superfriends, and for their time, it was a decent show.  But, the Superfriends lived off the campiness that existed in comics at the time.

I must admit that I had my reservations about the Justice League.  Even the Spider-Man cartoon of the 90s didn't show much violence.  Finally, animation has reached a point that, to please it's large adult audience, violence is now acceptable, especially since Justice League was a prime-time show and not a Saturday morning cartoon.

What can be said except that all of the characters are done to near perfection.  The personalities are intact, and cast of regulars who supply the voices are dead-on.  You can hardly mention good voice-work without mentioning Kevin Conroy's Batman.  He gives Batman the attitude and intelligence that Batman has.  Batman may be a guy without superpowers, but then again, Superman was once quoted in a Justice League comic, ""he's the most dangerous man on the planet.""  Batman's brains and deductive reasoning are virtually second-to-none in entire comic book industry.  He can spot weaknesses like a hound dog sniffing out a steak.

George Newbern is very good as Superman.  Superman is clearly the powerhouse of the team, despite possible exceptions from Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter.  As always, Superman is the iconic comic book character who embodies all that is good and just.  While this personality occasionally clashes with Batman's, the two, nevertheless, highly respect each other.

Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor on Smallville) gives the Flash a comedic charge that balances out the team of more serious players.  As the youngest member, he's a bit reckless, and always quick with the one-liners.  Rosenbaum is often stated that he loves doing comedy, and he certainly got his wish in developing the Flash.

The rest of the cast, Susan Eisenberg (Wonder Woman), Maria Canals (Hawkgirl), Carl Lumbly (Martian Manhunter), and Phil LaMarr (Green Lantern) are all great.  They help to make each character distinct with personalities that are consistent throughout the series.

Marvel's Avengers usually deal with problems on Earth.  One could easily argue that the Justice League is the most powerful superhero team in any comic book.  Even though they deal with problems on Earth as well, they also need more challenges, and therefore, they are often called away to help deal with crisis on other planets.  Their base of operations is on board the Watchtower, a large satellite (in the comic, the watchtower is on the moon) from where they can take off in one of their speedy transports (Javelin) to deal with problems.

The best part of the show is the action.  Finally, we're granted great fist-ta-cuffs when there is a fight.  We see buildings being crashed into and brought down as well as punches thrown that will rattle your teeth.  The Secret Origins episodes deal with the formation of the seven members, as a crisis proves too challenging for any one member to deal with.  Batman proclaims himself a part-timer, ""I'm not much of a team player.  But if you need me, and you will, call me.""

Once more, not all of the episodes has the entire line-up.  There are adventures with only three or four members.  This helps to create different looks as well as not overwhelming a situation that might easily be dealt with if the entire line-up were available.

I also enjoy the long list of guest-star voices.  After each episodes, I enjoy looking at who supplied voices.  You will recognize some, and others might surprise you.

This first season is great, and the funny part is that the Justice League only got better with each subsequent season.  It was a true shame that they stopped after four seasons.  This is one of the best animated shows I've ever seen because they finally did a comic book superhero team correctly, and who better to start with than the Justice League?",1192320000,5,4250,4.928169014084507

Most of the episodes/stories are divided in two episodes, so they are relatively easy to follow.

2474301,5,B000CSTK3S,"Let's STOP the comparisons between the Superfriends of the 70's and this well written great cartoon, the JLA. The Superfriends was like watching the Smurfs or Sesame Street because it came at a time when violence was being taken off the T.V. So expecting to see Superman or any of the superheroes using their super strenth as we know it, it just wasn't going to happen. Then they threw in those 2 stupid Wonder Twins characters, a dog and 2 other characters, Wendy and Marvin, and made it even worse! Superman was basically feminized in the Superfriends because there were times when the Wonder Twins would even save him. Even their headquaters was called the Hall of Justice and it was on a city street! If anyone can remember the 60's Superman cartoon, it was much, much better and more in line to the Superman TAS or the JLA. However, I still like the new Superman TAS and JLA better because it is better written and more intense stories. I've watched some of the Justice League episodes thought the ending of the first episode was pretty funny. At the end of the first episode, Superman was thinking of working together with the other superheroes, when Flash says ""you mean like Superfriends"" to which Superman says ""No, more like a Justice League"". To me, a well written little snipe to a completely terrible cartoon in the Superfriends. I haven't bought the series one yet, The Justice League of course, but I will happily order it asap. Then I can order volume 2 soon after. Do yourselves a favor, buy these cartoons as they are written like NO OTHER CARTOON OUT THERE TODAY!! TRUST ME! These cartoons are like watching mini movies and it's no wonder that the Superman, TSA won an emmy. AN EMMY?!? TO A CARTOON! This is usually given to sitcoms like ""Friends"" which I was never really to friendly about. Or Everybody Loves Raymond & even Seinfeld.

2474303,5,B000CSTK3S,"I tell my wife that I buy the Justice League season-releases for myself AND the kids. But it is me who sits most captivated in front of the TV with the kids as the episodes roll.

Shushing the kids so I can hear ""cartoons"" on TV is the joke my wife likes to make. I quickly correct her, ""Justice League is NOT 'cartoons.' It's an 'animated series.'"" This clarification for some reason always seems to bring on even more chuckles over a bottle of wine with friends than it does clarify the matter.

Anyway, indeed the kids sit captivated too. The Justice League stories are very well put together with a lot of detail. I'm not sure that my kids (age 3 - 7) appreciate or understand all of the emotion (sometimes pretty deep), heroism (of course), betrayal and just great story telling that goes into these Justice League productions. But rest assured, Justice League is definitely for kids too.

As far as I know, there are no single episodes in Seasons 1 & 2 with the exception of the Christmas episode, Comfort & Joy; all the rest in Seasons 1 & 2 are two and three parters. This means on DVD you have the opportunity to watch a 3 parter in one sitting, which is as good as sitting down with a full length feature. I'll take Secret Origins (Season 1) and Starcrossed (Season 2) over Tom Cruise in War Of The Worlds any day. (And are the alien war machines in War of the Worlds deliberate imitations of those in Secret Origins or is that just too much of a coincidence?!)

There are hours of entertainment on the Justice League Season 1 & 2 releases...and no dang gong Cartoon Network commercials! Well worth the purchase price.",1161561600,4,1628,4.453020134228188
2474304,4,B000CSTK3S,"A pet theory of mine is that JL, at least initially, was an excuse for Bruce Timm, Glen Murakami, Dan Riba, and all the other vets of Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series (along with Batman Beyond) to let their collective ids run wild and have a lot of cool super heroes fighting and causing lots of stuff to blow up.

To that end, they succeed magnificently.

The premise of the show is fairly simple - after an alien invasion where Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, the Green Lantern, and interstellar detective Hawkgirl are brought together by J'onn J'onzz (aka The Martian Manhunter) to save mankind, the company of heroes decides to stick together and act as a force of good for the world - a Justice League.

The more-than-two-dozen episodes in the Season One collection have the league facing other aliens, super-criminals, and under-water war-mongerers in fairly long (for a cartoon show) two- and three-part episodes. The show takes the science fiction trappings of both Batman Beyond and Superman: TAS and runs with them, creating a variety of incredibly fun alien landscapes, wierd technologies, and colorful side characters. The double and triple episode structure also allows for longer story arcs, giving each JL tale a similar scale to the team's previous works in episodes like Apokolips... Now! and Legacy.

However, the show's failing is that the characters aren't quite as interesting this time around. It's not a slight to the voice cast (everyone performs admirably, from returning vet Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight to newcomer George Newbern as Superman - though some fans may miss Tim Daly's voice as the Man of Steel). However, with over a half-dozen main characters and conflicts that continually pump up the scale with incredible action and even more side characters, there simply isn't enough room, even in 40-45 minutes, to explore the heroes themselves. At times, it leads to guest characters getting more development or interesting story than any of the main cast (Aquaman completely steals the show in The Enemy Below). And while some like Batman or the Manhunter can be interesting in concept alone, others like Hawkgirl get left out in the cold, often relegated to little more than ""meat-tank"" status for the action scenes.

However, the show's not completely without character (it just doesn't feel as explored compared to the best of Bruce Timm and co.'s previous work), and what it lacks in personal depth, it more than makes up in balls-out action and epic scale. In each story, the fate of the world or sometimes even the entire galaxy may hang in the balance, with just a handful of warriors to stand against the tide. The thematic struggles of good vs. evil are sometimes drawn in broad, bold strokes, while other times they raise valid questions over the need for the conflict. The animation is also impressive, and while it at times seems flat and lacks some of the deeper color tones of its predecessors, it's fluid, bright, smooth, and filled with a great sense of speed, power, and some very pretty effects.

Much like previous DVDs in the DC Comics Classics Collection, JL:S1 has creator/director commentaries on multiple key episodes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and a very crisp transfer (retaining the 1:33:1 aspect ratio the show used until the start of Season Two). While the special features aren't the most extensive, they're informative and fun, while offering a great look at the minds behind the magic.

Overall, Justice League: Season One is a great kick-off for the show, and just a great load of action-packed fun. There's something to be said when a show that appeals this much to the young and the old can make you feel gloriously like a wonder-struck child again.",1161043200,2,3764,4.97456279809221
2474305,4,B000CSTK3S,"The creators of the Batman and Superman animated series certainly had a blast as soon as they got the go-ahead to write stories for the Justice League. In one season they manage to cover a significant cross-section of the DC Universe, including stories about Aquaman, the Injustice Gang, Felix Faust, War World, Gorilla Grodd, Earth-2 (sort of), Morgan Le Fay, Vandal Savage, and many others. The quick jumps from one threat to the next might create a sense of vertigo for people new to the stories, especially since there is rarely enough time in each episode to introduce the explain the villains. Part of this is simply due to the format of the show, and the viewer will just need to try his best to keep up with the ride.

All the strengths and weaknesses of DC's superhero mythology are made obvious, here. The Batman and Superman series had the advantage of sticking to one main character and his particular set of villains. However, when a princess with a Grecian-legendary background (Wonder Woman), a Martian (J'onn J'onzz), two space cops (Hawkgirl and Green Lantern), a man who runs fast (The Flash) and a superpowered alien (Superman) are tossed together in the same bag, the inconsistencies of the fictional universe are made a little more plain. From week to week they may be fighting Greek gods, time-travelling immortal Nazis, King Arthur's half-sister, or mer-men. Still, the incoherency of the whole thing is part of the fun.

All in all, the first season of Justice League is a lot of fun. Pop it in the DVD player some Saturday morning, and remember the days when children's entertainment was still entertaining.",1158883200,,1632,4.866906474820144

2474322,5,B000CSTK3S,"With the little ones bugging me about seeing Superhero movies, I looked into this cartoon.  They can enjoy most of the episodes although if they start to get scared, I will switch it off.  Although appropriate for most children the series has enough substance to statisfy parents and fans of all ages.  Forget the silly SuperFriends.  These cartoons are well drawn, have fairly good plots, and most all the characters are defined.  There relationships are not always smooth, which makes for a better show.  The action is drawn out too long for mhy taste, but again it's perfect for the kids.",1151798400,2,591,4.801980198019802
2474323,3,B000CSTK3S,"It all started in 1992 with Batman The Animated Series, and the brilliant, creative, and ground breaking team members such as Bruce Timm, Hilary Bader, Paul Dini, Andrea Romano, and so many others.  That show created a ripple effect that resulted in many more comic-to-cartoon transformations for Batman and Superman in years to come.  The Justice League is one of the last and latest.

A few years after Batman and Superman have been doing their thing in their respective cities, they eventually band together to form a team as a reaction to larger global threats in the world of super villainy.

To hardcore fans of Bruce Timm's animated series adaptations, not all of Justice League season 1 measures up to their expectations, but kids will love it just the same.  There are a few gems in this season's set which make it worth buying, but weary parents may want to sample it first before buying the entire season.

You can easily rent ""Justice League: Secret Origins"" from the kids section of your favorite rental place.  It's the same three episodes that you can find on the season 1 box set.  Watch it with your kids. The action is clean and isn't too gratuitous, so I see this season, and show in general, to be a good way to keep the kids busy with something they'd like, if they're into superheroes.",1151798400,2,1307,4.6521739130434785

Great Storytelling.

Recognition of Continuity to previous series (Batman, Superman).

People actually get hurt and/or die.

There are actually repercussions and consequences to actions.

Cons:

Superman was made into a wimp.

The Marshian Manhunter doesn't use his phase power coherently.

The crossover 2-part episode from the Statick Shock cartoon series entitled ""A League of Their Own"" was not included.

Lex Luthor's unexplained prison escape (he's somewhat hidden in the episode in question).",1151107200,2,506,5.821917808219178

2474326,5,B000CSTK3S,"For those who may be disappointed that the dvd set for Justice League of America season 1 is in full frame I have good news...  I had tivo'd several episodes from season 1 in widescreen and recently thought to compare it with the full frame version.  Apparently, all they did to make it widescreen was crop the top and bottom of the full frame version!!!  Therefore, if you've got a widescreen tv, all you have to do is adjust the frame size (or whatever it is your tv does, which generally results in zooming in and cropping the top and bottom of the screen, as opposed to that undesirable stretch-to-fit mode).  The argument may be that there's a quality loss in zooming,  but I'm watching it right now at it looks awesome!  Besides, we're talking about animated 2-d line art here, not Return Of The King high angle sweeping landscape shots of the Victory at Minas Tirith.

And oh yeah, this is essentially the best superhero stuff I've ever seen in my life, and the good news is they get better and better each season- with the JLU material being TOP NOTCH!

JLU is airing its final episodes here in April/May 2006, unfortunately. I was at a panel with Bruce Timm and the series writers, and part of the reason they're ending the show is it's literally getting too difficult to write and they don't want to risk having a season that doesn't live up to the expectations at this point.",1145664000,16,1386,4.49402390438247

This series from the creators of Batman the Animated Series ans Superman the Animated series goes beyond the 80's Superfriends cartoon. In The Superfriends cartoon, the league  always leaned on the wonder twins to get them outta a jam...,and that didn't seen so real. In the superfriends, VILLIAN NOTE..The League  had the hall of justice in the middle of town!

The one thing that makes this superhero show different is the interplay between the characters. They played up that these were also heroes in the own right, with thoughts and feeling.  However Sometime the glibness of the Flash gets in the way. Another it doesn't talk down to the audience, it comes to all with intelligence that a well done production needs..NO HOLY MOLEY, BATMAN will ever be heard (thank gawd!)..not like the 60's  flimation stuff or the Hanna Barbara's Superfriends

Nice work in 26 episodes-worth your time and money. I can't wait for season two on DVD later this year

2474338,4,B000CSTK3S,"I would have given 5 stars if not for a niggling problem with the discs.

The first season of Justice League is among the best that DC/Warner Animation has to offer. From the origin story to the epic 3-part finale, the episodes will entertain both youngsters and adults (I watch these with both my 8 year old and my mom). I will not comment on them individually because other reviews here that do that well.

Beware however if Subtitles are important to you. While the box set is supposed to have English subtitles (even says so on the box) in fact it only has French and Spanish.

This looks to be a production issue since the box states there are English subtitles, so I'm returning mine and waiting for Warner to correct this in a future batch.

As long-time fans know, whereas Warner Animation is excellent, Warner Home Video consistently lets fans down with poor product features and no attention to detail. This seems to be yet another case of that.",1145577600,7,955,4.567251461988304

The Secret Origins three parter is one of the best in the series.  We get to see how the league was first formed.  As the first season steams ahead, we see a relationship between Hawkgirl and Green Lantern taking shape.  Before I bought this set, I hadn't been introduced to Bruce Tim's version of Aquaman.  I thought he was gonna be one of those second rate heros.  Nope.  Was I ever wrong?!  Not sure what he looks like, but love the voice!  This guy means business!

  Fans are also treated to Injustice for All, another memorable multiparter in which a dying Lex Luthor brings together a powerful group of villains to counter the League including Grundy, Joker(Well he kinda invited himself), and others.  Knight of Shadows is also excelent because we are introduced to Jason Blood aka the Demon.  We also get a long overdue look at the Green Lantern core in another notable multipart episode, In Blackest Night.

And I'm including live-action shows too.  This release is a must have for comic fans, fantasy fans, action fans, and fans of good writing, good characters.

Season One however does have a few hiccups.  The writing stumbles occasionally and not all these stories are great.  But even as the show was finding its way, it was still marvelous.  Having two or three part episodes allows for more complex stories and it's good that they don't use every character in every story.  The animation is clean, simple, yet always appealing.  Put me down for the people who always thought Superfriends was silly, so it's nice to finally have a cool version.

I agree that it would've been nice to be able to watch a whole story without having to watch the credits, but hey, I'm not going to complain about that.  It's what FF is for.

It's great to see different characters highlighted in every episode.  Comicbook-wise, I've always been a Marvel fan.

""It's only a cartoon"" you say.  Well, this is a warning that this series is not for the kiddies: Name me another drama where a major character hacks off his hand with his belt buckle to save his family.  Inter-racial romances, plot twists reminiscent of the original Twilight Zone, it's all here.

Every website and the back of the box itself lists that the season comes with subtitles in English and yet the option isn't available anywhere on any of the 4 disks. I've email the WB every day since 3/21 when the set came out and no response at all.

What I love about this product was the JL show itself.  All the wonderfully written stories that I got to watch again, some along with creators' commentaries.

Where this lacks is the packaging, a 4 dvd set the designed to fit into the size of a single dvd container.  This was the same way the Fantastic Four 1990s animated series was released.  I don't have much of a problem with that.  The only thing really bugs me is that the chapter/scene selection sucks.  hitting the ""next scene"" button on the remote is useless.

I hit next scene in an attempt to skip this and found instead to be skipped to the next episode!

So once again I am disapointed that my STORE BOUGHT DVD is not convienient to watch at all.

I KNOW we have the technology to break up episodes into chapters.  EPECIALLY when EVERY EPISODE is MULTI-PART.  I find it VERY TEDIOUS to have to fast forward through ""Last time on..."" and opening credits for EVERY EPISODE, especially when I JUST WATCHED IT!  When I pop in my DVD and hit ""Play All"" I want to watch a story all the way through!

Now if I select an episode, then sure have the ""last time on..."" and opening credits.  When a story ends then having opening credits is ok too.  But when I am going through a season I don't want to have to watch the opening credits AGAIN AND AGAIN in the MIDDLE of EVERY STORY.  At least if there was a chapter selection I could easily skip it, but they don't even give us that courtesy.

This is a real headache for me, I can't get comfortable with my store bought DVD.

What I find MOST DISTURBING is that many bootleg copies DO have chapter selections, and DON'T make you watch ""Last Time On..."" sequences for EPISODES YOU JUST WATCHED!!!!  And often it is cheaper than the Store bought one as well.

Now, I don't condone bootleging, I don't like it.  But when a bootlegger puts out a better product (more convienient to watch and a more enjoyable viewing experiance, as it is not constantly interupted) I can understand why people buy them.

Warner Bros., you need to smarten up and stop doing these sets on the cheap.  Take a little more time and do them right.

The four discs are jammed into two sides, and one disc overlaps the other without and protective surfaces.

Having the added commentary along with the new episodes doesn't quite justify the purchase price, but if it sends a message to WB headquarters that ""Yes, we do in fact WANT season sets."" Then I'm more than happy to pony up the cash.",1142899200,2,526,4.36734693877551

I can only hope and pray the tools at Warner Bros. follow suit and give us the second season, and the first two JLU seasons, sometime soon rather than releasing them one every year.",1139529600,12,996,4.49171270718232

Just when we, the faithful followers of Bruce Timm and co.'s DC Universe cartoon series had began to think that it was all over, Justice League made its memorable debut on Cartoon Network.  The lineup in this first season consists of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash (Wally West), Green Lantern (Jon Stewart), The Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl.  This first season was done mostly in two part format, with the first story being three.  Villains that show up include Gorilla Grodd, Lex Luthor, and the Joker, along with other well-known and less well known baddies. Future seasons would broaden in scope, and the name would eventually change to Justice league Unlimited, with the roster expanding many times over.  Some VERY nice animation and storytelling here, which only improves in future seasons.

Minor complaint - George Newbern takes over as Superman here, and his voice doesn't cut it for me after hearing Tim Daly on Superman: TAS.  Thank God they got Kevin Conroy back as Batman. Final Grade: A-",1137628800,7,1068,5.028409090909091
8102123,4,B000CSTK3S,"This series is really cool and I like the stories, because they are all in 2-3 episode formats (for the most part), so they can tell longer story arcs. Only downside to this was that I could not play multiple episodes on discs 1 & 4 due to defects, but my refund was taken care if fairly quickly.",1524009600,,296,4.120689655172414
