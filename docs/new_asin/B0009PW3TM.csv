8065320,3,B0009PW3TM,"Strange early 70's East German / Bulgarian / Russian-made, English sub-titled sci-fi film.  For me it was convoluted and hard to understand.  The nearest I can figure is that Earth has lost contact with a space station (or something) and there are shadowy life-forms.  There appear to be flashbacks.  The DVD is excellent quality.  The color is good and the picture is clear and sharp.  I personally can't recommended this film since I did not enjoy it, but I'm sure there is an audience for this type of science fiction.",1467763200,2,521,4.733333333333333
