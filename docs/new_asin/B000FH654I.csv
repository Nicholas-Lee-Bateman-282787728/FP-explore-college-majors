8122550,3,B000FH654I,I was glad to see this finally released on dvd.  Tony Curtis does very well as Ira Hayes a Pima Indian who was one of the flag raisers on Iwo Jima.  How he didn't quite fit in as a Marine.  And how he couldn't adjust back to civilian life after the war.  Very well done.,1513814400,,270,3.8545454545454545

8122554,5,B000FH654I,"I've had this movie in VHS format for years. Tony Curtis should have been awarded an Oscar for his terrific portrayal of Ira Hamilton Hayes. I consider 'The Outsider' with Tony Curtis the most valuable movie in my personal collection, and yes, I am a veteran..",1452297600,3,260,4.673913043478261
8122555,4,B000FH654I,"This film is part of history of the United States of America. A part concerning the freedom we enjoy today. As many lives were given for the freedom, this was one of the event which assured our freedom. A must for one's collection.",1342051200,2,231,4.395348837209302
8122556,5,B000FH654I,"Because there are as many ways to approach a film review as there are people, I call ""The Outsider"" an awesome and powerful film which continues to linger emotionally in the memory, forever.  Affected immensely by it when it was first released, I have never been able to shake the image of Tony Curtis' performance which I place on a plane with Kirk Douglas' in ""Lust for Life,"" James Dean's in ""East of Eden"" or Heath Ledger's in ""Brokeback Mountain.""  Anyone may argue that one actor is much more accomplished than another, but all these portraits remain ensconced in a permanent place within me, yet they also share the commonality that none were recognized by the film academy as winners in their respective year.  While Ira Hayes is portrayed beautifully in the newer film on the same subject - ""Flags of Our Fathers,""  I shall always consider Tony Curtis' portrayal in the older film, arguably, his finest hour as an actor and among the most memorable portrayls by a male actor on film!  While true that the film had good production values, without that haunting portrayal (and the haunting song, ""Where Are You?""), it might not have been as powerful a film.  This deserves to be on DVD and is sorely missing.",1261440000,6,1215,4.7075471698113205
8122557,4,B000FH654I,"Very touching and sad story of a very brave man..You just want

to reach out and help this man after his best friend dies..without a doubt the best part of the movie is when Ira

accidently meets his best friend's mother after he is killed

and goes over to her and places his head against her, and she

holds him just like she would her son, feeling his pain, just like she knew they had this something in common, a broken heart

from her son dying and his best friend..a very touching moment

in a very touching story",1154390400,8,519,4.244897959183674
