1211358,4,B00000FE0H,"I had seen this movie when I was young and wanted to see it again, you know, to see if it was as good as I remembered it as a boy.

I was pleasantly surprised.  It was actually better then I had remembered it!

The film quality may not be the greatest in the world but the acting isn't too bad.

Great for family entertainment.",1244592000,,327,3.9846153846153847
1211359,5,B00000FE0H,For the time period that this movie was made it was really good.  Enjoyed it to the end.,1227484800,2,88,3.888888888888889
1211360,5,B00000FE0H,This is a very heartfelt movie about a young Indian boy accidently thrown off of a train and his relationship with a horse. It's well worth watching!!,1221264000,2,150,4.592592592592593
1211361,5,B00000FE0H,"I bought this for my daughter, who's now 21. She loves horses (has one of her own) and loves all horse movies including this one. It was good! Now we're moving so parting out our huge collection of movies to sell. A Lot of her horse movies she's decided to part with.",1120780800,2,267,4.153846153846154
1211362,3,B00000FE0H,"I am a horse freak and bought the movie cause it was cheap and about horses (I have the DVD version)  It was not the greatest movie I have ever seen and the sound quality seemed poor to me at times (then again, I was really sick when I watched it)",1111795200,,247,3.843137254901961
1211363,5,B00000FE0H,"My 7 year old daughter loves this movie! This movie is a classic. It's hard to find movies for kids that are intertaining yet provide a good life lesson. This is one of those movies. It shows how people can move past their cultural biasis and treat others with kindness and respect. I recommend this movie, especially if you love horses.",1100736000,10,337,4.540983606557377
1211364,1,B00000FE0H,"I bought this (DVD version)for the grandkids, and am I glad I previewed it!  The plot involves the bigotry of a caucasian community focused against a Native American child. I certainly don't want to be the one to introduce my grandchildren to this dark concept and time. (It is set in the 19-teens.)  Perhaps when they are older, and can see it as history, but there are many better films. There is a scene of violence and bullying which I would not want young children to see. The horse dies - this will not please young viewers.  This film is old - the color is bad, and it was filmed before people started trying for an appearance of reality.  The ""horse trainer"" who befriends the boy is completely inept around the animal (an Arabian).  Perhaps he had to be to make the obviously gentle horse seem threatening.  I can think of no other reason.  Save your money.",1072051200,12,866,4.477707006369426
1211365,5,B00000FE0H,I think its a great movie because the way the storie is also the horse is so gorgeous and wonderful.,973814400,3,100,4.05
7908262,2,B00000FE0H,"Another one of those feel-good movies that make the people who wrote it, maybe the actors and direction personnel. feel good. Preachy movies aren't really art, they brainwash people. It was clear whom they wanted to aim the movie at, and when all is said and done, they do to them what they think they are protecting victims from. I don't think we've learned anything from the 60's and 70's except greed, forcing on others what we believe and couching it in words and subliminal messaging that makes no one feel better except those who make a buck from it. Art reflects reality, or should, and the reality this movie envisions is the reality they hope to shame others into. The only difference between the time when this movie was made and now, is that we have empowered the government to raise our children and speak for us behind the veiled wink and nod that it knows better than we.",1517356800,,885,4.5375

7908267,4,B00000FE0H,"Yet another example of a movie coming from a time where filmmakers knew how to create characters we genuinely care about while involving them in a heartwarming story that keeps us glued to our seats. Is it heavy handed at times? Sure. Predictable? Yep.

But it is impossible not to fall in love with the Native American character of Frankie, played by Juan Gonzales. The whole film is really on his shoulders as he is the crux of all that happens for the plot. He's got community prejudice, the loss of his family and going to school as a new experience to handle, all while training Red Fury, an incredibly gorgeous horse given to him by a generous man with a history of heartbreak of his own. Sure, that backstory is great, and it provides more plot devices to emerge, but this is truly Juan's movie. He does an admirable job propping up the film for a boy so young in spite of the fact that the movie does tend to go a bit overboard at times trying to make its' points.

Still, the acting is first rate from all of the actors, and if you want to see a story about a boy and his bond with his horse that keeps you the adult just as interested as your kids, you'd be hard pressed to find a more suitable tale than The Red Fury. 4.75 stars",1405123200,2,1239,4.223628691983122
7908268,5,B00000FE0H,I chose this rating because the service I received was excellent. This movie was a heart warming story about the love between a boy and a horse.  This is a story about what a boy suffered to own this horse. How the boy was able to get past the treatment he received and risk his horse to save a life. This is a movie that I would recommend.,1366588800,3,340,4.0
7908269,5,B00000FE0H,Red Fury is an entertaining film about a boy and his horse. I enjoyed seeing the lovely Diane McBain acting again in this.,1365292800,,122,4.3478260869565215
