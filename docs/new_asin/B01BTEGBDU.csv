7669131,5,B01BTEGBDU,"I absolutely love this show, I can even watch re-runs and still can not stop laughing and for me that is hard to come by, I just found out today that CBS canceled this show. Not only am I surprised I am also super upset they are all incredibly talented and funny actors and the writing is great too. What on earth were they thinking? And knowing my luck they will replace it with some crappy reality show that I won't give a care about anyway. Too bad I suppose I will have to wait to see what comes up next season though I will hope it comes back.",1369094400,9,548,4.036697247706422

a hit and miss;  so its no wonder it didn't make the cut as they say.....

kept your attention to see what odd-ball thing she would come up with next !",1368316800,,369,4.231884057971015

I have seasons 1-6 on dvd and wish they would release season 7 on dvd but the only way to get it is to download it.

7669165,5,B01BTEGBDU,One of the best shows to get cancelled. Season 7 is one of the best while whatever season was rushed because of the Charlie Sheen debacle was the weakest.,1409616000,2,154,4.344827586206897

7669168,5,B01BTEGBDU,"For the life of me I cannot understand why this show was cancelled. It is a mirror of todays lifestyle and everyday situations. You can so easily relate to every calamity that they get in and out of. The jokes are entertaining,current, and very tounge and cheek. This is just the right show to unwind for the day and share laughs with your significant other as you racall similar experiances.",1403481600,3,392,4.614285714285714

7669171,5,B01BTEGBDU,The final season of Rules of Engagement were a bitter sweet season for me. I loved the dynamic of the group and the humor. Patrick Warburton is one funny man. The beginning of the series felt a little weak in the writing and a little far fetched for some of the plots but I liked how it was all wrapped up in the end. There is a bit of a rewrite in the final episode to tie things together and I can see how that would anger some people but I didn't care.,1387238400,2,455,3.903225806451613

7669173,5,B01BTEGBDU,An excellent show that CBS has dropped. When I see some of the shows that are still on I have to wonder who makes these decisions and are they regularly drug tested. If not they should be. I have purchased all the seasons available and am waiting patiently for the last season to be released. Anyone have a clue as to when? Everyone I know who watched Rules of Engagement loved it. It will be missed.,1380585600,13,400,4.276315789473684
7669174,5,B01BTEGBDU,We all loved this show in my family and were very sorry to hear it won't be back! Amazing that a show as dumb as Two Broke Girls is on but a more cleverly written show like Rules of Engagement is taken off the air.,1377475200,16,214,3.7777777777777777
7669175,5,B01BTEGBDU,"Yes.  This is one of the best comedies ever!  If you haven't watched it, watch it.  If you watched it and weren't sure, watch it some more.  Some of the funniest stuff ever!",1373500800,10,173,4.151515151515151
