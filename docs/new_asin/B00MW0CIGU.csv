6602747,5,B00MW0CIGU,Princess Bride is everyone's all-time favorite. Everybody quotes from Princess Bride. It has a cute story but it is the one-liners that everyone loves. Rain Man is a classic and the acting is unbeatable. You actually believe that Dustin Hoffman is profoundly autistic. When Harry met Sally is so sappy that I love it. I have watched it several times. Moonstruck has Cher and Nicholas Cage. I doubt there is anything else you need in a movie. The acting is great. I love the story. All four movies are great!,1441152000,6,507,4.644444444444445

6602761,4,B00MW0CIGU,"I always purchase these 3 or 4 movie combo packs to save on DVD space especially with streaming being so prevalent now.  I only buy these for my wife who struggles with working the streaming technology and for my son during long car trips.  In this case, this movie set was for my wife.  She loves 3 of the 4 movies on this DVD except Princess Bride.  I bought the DVD knowing she would never watch that movie and it still is a great value.  The reason for 4 stars is that these 4 movie DVDs always have the one movie that isn't as enjoyable as the other 3.  I know a lot of people love Princess Bride and I've seen it twice myself but the DVD was for my wife and she couldn't be bothered.  At least all 4 have a romantic comedy theme and not randomly thrown together like other collections",1487635200,,790,4.124183006535947
