3451233,5,B001AIQ15O,"Without doubt Duckman was one of the most clever and iconoclastic animated shows of all time!  With great animation and perfectly voiced by a host of superb comic actors (and guest stars), and drawn with a touch of Salvador Dali, this cartoon gem has been too long in coming to DVD.  For those who enjoy satire with a dash of anarchy then Duckman is the perfect place to spend a couple of hours.  Forget Donald, Daffy and even Howard...Duckman rules!",1216339200,4,450,4.6
3451234,4,B001AIQ15O,"Finally coming to DVD is Duckman, the cult animated series about a foul-mouthed, sex crazed, duck turned private eye (voiced by Jason Alexander) who gets into all sorts of mischief and mayhem.  Among his cohorts is his pig partner, the Joe Friday-based Cornfed (voiced by Gregg Berger), his hated sister-in-law Bernice (voiced by Nancy Travis), and his dim-witted son Ajax (voiced by Dweezil Zappa), his conjoined twin sons, and the incontinent and flatulent Grandma-ma.  Subversive and occasionally intelligent, Duckman ended up being a pretty funny animated blast during it's entire four season run, and during these first two seasons, we bear witness to Duckman evading the IRS, falling under the spell of a televangelist, and goes to war with his arch-nemesis King Chicken (voiced by Tim Curry).  There's definitely nothing refined about Duckman, but for what it is, Duckman is an often funny and comical animated blast that deserves another look.  All in all, now that Duckman is on DVD, now is the time to give the series another well-deserved look.",1215302400,6,1055,5.152046783625731
3451235,5,B001AIQ15O,"I don't know what the various legal holdups were, but it's finally out.

I won't get into the whole deal of what Duckman is about,  but suffice it to  say that if you enjoy dumb fathers (Family Guy, Simpsons) outrageous,  absurd, and frequently R-rated adventures (South Park, Clerks), rapid-fire dialogue (Black Adder, Gilmore Girls , or biting social commentary (Norman Lear, Bill Hicks, George Carlin,) then THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU!
One caveat: a lot of the topical humor will now be sorely dated, but some of it will be as current as ever. But that aside, DUCKMAN RULES!",1214524800,2,575,4.72
3451236,5,B001AIQ15O,"Bought some crappy, foreign DVD copy of this most excellent show - the other reviewers are correct: excellent voice acting, writing, and amusing if not minimalist in its style of execution (Duckman has no eyes when his glasses fall off for example).

Duckman is a ""Private Dick (for hire)"", but doesn't even know what clues, evidence or even detective work all mean.  He is emotional, judgemental, politically incorrect, abusive, controlling and yet he is also stupidly optimistic.

Highly recommended for laughing so hard, your abs might hurt!  This review is for the show, as I await the DVD's with eager anticipation (or stupid optimism - see, it works!).  Show is based on comic books of same name or vice versa.",1213056000,9,716,4.933333333333334

I've given it Five Stars purely based on the quality of the show - the writing is spot-on, the voice acting is top-notch and the humour itself is twisted - that's why I like it!

It was off the air for so long, and when it was playing, it was playing at 1 AM in the morning so a lot of people have really seen it.

But dig in, one of the sharpest and wittiest shows ever. The writing is top notch as are the voices (Jason Alexander is PERFECT as the lead, PERFECT..)
No laugh track, thank god (when will they learn...).
And something I always love about this show, is that is looks and feels like a comic strip.

3451282,4,B001AIQ15O,"DUCKMAN-SEASONS ONE & TWO: ""Trapped in a world he never created"", as its tag line went, DUCKMAN, everyone's favorite porn obsessed, self centered, socially inept private investigator lorded over a lascivious, avant garde looney-verse in this animated free-for-all. Playing a nastier, even less politically correct version of his SEINFELD character GEORGE COSTANZA, JASON ALEXANDER pumped repugnant, ranting personality into underground comic artist EVERETT BECK's intrepid anti-hero. Putting the ""funk"" in dysfunctional family was over bearing, health nut sis-in-law BERNICE (NANCY TRAVIS), dim bulb Vally dude son AJAX (DWEEZIL ZAPPA), sensible two headed offspring CHARLES and MAMBO, a flatulent grandmother and his intellectual JOE FRIDAY-inspired work partner, CORNFED PIG. DUCKMAN hilariously lampooned society's seedy underbelly (from phone sex and tabloid journalism to cosmetic surgery and reality TV), peppered with rapid fire dialogue, pop culture pot shots and bizarre-o characters seemingly sucked from the minds of R. CRUMB, ED WOOD and JOHN WATERS. You either ""got it"" or you didn't...and you can bet your tail feathers DUCKMAN probably coulda cared less either way.

3451283,5,B001AIQ15O,"This show is really very good. Five-jokes-per-second in a rapid-fire progression of carefully constructed dialogue belied by eye-achingly off-kilter animation and Frank Zappa music. An often merciless send-up of American society punctuated at times by deeply honest psychological introspection, a show with heart as well as (poorly animated) boobs, clearly written by people too smart to be working for television but not pulling any punches for it, creating a deceptively multilayered confection of cleverness you won't fully catch until the third viewing.

3451286,4,B001AIQ15O,"A friend of mine alerted me to this animation targeted to adults.  I had never heard of it.  So I gave it a try. Its adult-oriented themes are interesting, to say the least. The level of animation is interesting in that all of the characters, environment, and objects in the cartoon are crudely drawn, which gives it that non-child feeling.

3451289,5,B001AIQ15O,"Duckman is by far one of the better cartoon shows with adult humor thrown into the mixture.  But for those out there who never saw Duckman or heard of the show I'll give you a blow by blow of the first two seasons.  First off great one liners plus very funny actor doing the voice over of the Duckman character.  Cornfeed his trusty sidekick at the detective job.  Another added bonus was King Chicken as the main bad guy for the series.  One of my favorite episodes was the Super Computer because what the super computer said was true ""A perfect world is an inperfect world.""  Violence wise I enjoy how Duckman killed fluffy and uranus in each episode made me laugh so hard.  One of the shows had Cornfeed with an afro priceless.  I like how the comedians did guess spots on the show for example ""Joking the chicken.""  Now Season two had some killer one liners for example Cornfeed ""When I snap I kill him first.""  The Dope trail was priceless because Cornfeed as a laywer was so priceless and humorous.  America the Beuatiful good musical ending, The Gem turns Duckman sees his mother and tries not to end up like her. Nam episode Cornfeed thinks he is a father and goes to try find out if it's true and Duckman thinks he was in Nam but it was all the Nam movies he saw growing up.  Ajax ends up writing poems and gets a job writing gretting cards but Duckman saves his son.  The last show was just called Clip Job which was just highlights of Duckman's life manly all the bad things he did to his family, friends, and coworkers, plus innocent female bystanders.  Overall very funny show with great one liners, some moral lessons thrown in here and there, so if you got a great sense of humor and enjoy this type of Cartoon then buy it and enjoy show after show of season one and two.  I plan to buy three and four later this year.",1346025600,,1833,4.318713450292398

I find some of the jokes funny but not as funny as it was when I was sixteen to eighteen years old. I still would rather watch Duckman over some other cartoon comedy shows.

Starring a duck detective who has his head in the wrong place and well meaning friends who he never appreciates, he runs headfirst into situations he is completely incapable of handling. A crass, loud, sex driven duck, at face value he might not seem someone you could fall in love with. But with his witty rants and occassional poignant devotion to his late wife, you can't help but wrap your arms around this show and not let go. Aided by Beatrice's theme, you truly begin to understand what it means to have a 'better half', someone that brings out the best in you. Definitely a good show!",1225584000,,669,4.583333333333333

Took me a while to get used to his voice (never did like Jason Alexander or Seinfeld) but that went away in time and I fully enjoyed Duckman in his own right -- along with the appalling Bernice, the kids from hell, his pal with the Joe Friday delivery, the whole demented lot. Keeps me sane between repeat, I say, repeat viewings of Ren & Stimpy. Duckman is the MAN!",1224460800,,450,4.125
3451302,4,B001AIQ15O,"I won't echo the sentiments of all the previous reviews: clearly, if you remember Duckman enough to be searching for this DVD, you, like me, were a big fan when it was on USA.  It's great to finally have this DVD after many years of no Duckman available to the public, and for many of you who didn't have the good fortune to tape the show when it was on the air, this will be your first chance in over a decade to relive the show AT ALL.  The one thing that brings down the quality of this set is the occasional cut material.  Granted, most episodes are untouched, and the ones that were only lost about 10 seconds of material, almost always for copyright purposes.  For example, in one episode, Duckman has a seventies-style hallucination orchestrated by a Frank Zappa instrumental and culminates in a few bars of ""Let the Sun Shine In.""  On the DVD, the hallucination ends before the song starts.  It's literally just a few seconds of material, and of course this type of cut doesn't really kill any of the humor, but for purists like myself, it's annoying.  If you're not annoyed with these very minor cuts, and are just plain thrilled to finally have whatever Duckman you can get, period, this set will not disappoint.",1222992000,20,1222,4.502262443438914
3451303,5,B001AIQ15O,"One of the funniest shows of all time.

3451304,5,B001AIQ15O,"I too can't wait for this to come out..The show brings me back to my late high school years and early college years.

It was a show that developed a brain. I recall the first season being total comedy with great gags to make me laugh to where I coughed hard. Then they added a lot of social and political stuff with the humor.

I vividly recall a great concept ep where Duckman seems to travel through past decades looking for ""America"" (voiced by Heather Lockerlear) and he gets depressed searching for ""her""....Another good one, and even a little chilling, was the one where the neighbours are trying to destroy each other and Duckman jumps up and down with glee shouting ""I WON..I WON"".

I agree that to this day I'm ticked at USA. Those were the days before on-screen cable guides. After season 2 or 3, I thought the show was done. Then I'd see in the newspaper that the show (and I'll never forget the times) was airing at 1am or 3am at times. So I assumed they were all reruns no longer being in the key 10pm USA Friday slot. I'd either be out on the town or sleeping and forgetting to tune in.

A few years ago Comedy Central was airing reruns of this gem on Sunday nights. I finally caught up and saw the eps I've been missing including the final ep. Not even sure that it was meant to be a total series finale or if it was a season cliff hanger, but obviously the show never came back..

Sadly, I think the show could have lasted as over the years Comedy Central and Cartoon Network have been willing to spend money to buy rights and produce NEW TV shows instead of just being all rerun channels. I'm sure if times were different back then one of them would have been glad to pick Duckman up from USA.

Anyway, good to share some memories with fellow fans.",1219881600,3,1765,4.285285285285285
3451305,5,B001AIQ15O,"I've always enjoyed animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Though none of them are as deranged as Duckman. It's been 11 years since the inception of DVD and I've been waiting impatiently this entire time for this show to get a release. Originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 Duckman lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale.

The titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and pretty much the worst living person in the world. He's a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). You name it, Duckman has done it. But who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world he/we live in is so insane, outrageous and just plain nonsensical?

Eric Tiberius Duckman(voiced by the maniacal Jason Alexander) could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. My favorite has to be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is perpetually oblivious to his partner's infinity of vices and incompetence.

The typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably blunder through or will revolve around his highly dysfunctional household, though every now and again Duckman's arch-enemy King Chicken (Tim Curry), a sort of Professor Moriarty in fowl form, hatches some diabolical scheme in revenge for being bullied in high school.

Since I was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever surpass it. There never was, or will be, anything quite like Duckman ever again. The level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique Klasky/Csupo style (anyone who has seen Rugrats will understand). It's a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel.

I do hope this DVD set gives us all of the episodes complete and uncut. I cannot wait to get my hands on it and I eagerly await seasons 3 and 4.
