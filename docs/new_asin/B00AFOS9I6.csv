5423645,5,B00AFOS9I6,"Jonas Kaufmann is the star of this show!! I think Wagner would be very pleased by Act 1. The rest of the cast is great also.
But you can't beat Jimmy Levine and the Met orchestra.",1370822400,,179,4.0
5423646,5,B00AFOS9I6,"Anything with Kaufmann is superb! I Heard the performance at the Met and was transported!  I even like the ""machine""!",1369958400,4,117,4.85

1st 3 attempts to load results in INVALID and CANNOT OPERATE THIS DISC

4th: loaded

5th-10th: wouldn't load

11th: loaded

I then tested 5 other blu-ray discs.m several times each....all loaded the first time.  Tried DW again, and couldn't get it to load.

So it's either the wrong format or a defective disc.  I will follow up here after I receive the replacement.",1368748800,,476,4.7073170731707314
5423648,5,B00AFOS9I6,I haven't listened to Act III yet - I am trying to get over Siegmund's death before I proceed - but at least acts I and II are wonderful.  If I never see/hear another Walkure again I won't mind because I can just watch this one over and over and over.  I cannot imagine anyone ever topping Kaufmann's Siegmund.,1366416000,4,310,4.237288135593221
5423649,1,B00AFOS9I6,"the DVD box shown is not the opera that the people reviewed.. It's  from an earlier performance with a different cast. I would not make a purchase until
this mistake is corrected",1365033600,3,178,4.5625
5423650,1,B00AFOS9I6,"All 21 customer reviews are for the DVD format and not a single review
 for this bluray format.
I think that costomer reviews from 2001 for a product that was released
 on 2013 is absurd",1364860800,4,186,4.285714285714286
8550996,5,B00AFOS9I6,"personally I like the machine. I thought it made the river, the forest and the Walkure ride come alive. I have seen the entire cycle and must put an a word for Jay hunter Morris' fantastic last minute Siegfried He truly looked like he had been working with cast all along.",1518652800,,272,4.352941176470588
8550997,1,B00AFOS9I6,"I bought this out of admiration for Kaufman but found his performance less than his best. He seems to be forcing the tone and is often not quite on pitch in act one.  I hope he will think twice  before settling into this repertory. Wagner always raises questions.  Were these operas sung at modern pitch where everyone screams at the top of their register all night or were they sung lower so that Wotan's lowest notes don't project? As for the staging, like many ""concepts"", aside from a few striking moments, the ""machine"" does precious little to enhance the drama. All that mechanical stuff must have cost plenty but looks like an attempt to save money! On the whole a big disappointment.",1456272000,,691,4.647540983606557
8550998,4,B00AFOS9I6,"I attended the matinee performance that was used for this DVD. Excellent all around! Top honors go to James Levine, Jonas Kaufmann, Eva Marie Westbroek, Bryn Terfel, Stephanie Blythe, and Deborah Voigt. There were many criticisms going around at that time. First, that The Machine was a terrible concept - I thought it was wonderful and evocative. And it created an extraordinary acoustic so that singing at all volumes could be easily heard. Second, that Voigt wasn't up to the task of Brunnhilde. She was certainly better in previous seasons as Sieglinde (a part she nearly owned), but she sang very well in this performance. Kaufmann and Westbroek sang beautifully, looked great, and were ultimately heartbreaking. Terfel and Blythe brought to life their scene together - a scene that is usually a crashing bore. My only quibble is that the final scene between Wotan and Brunnhilde was woefully misguided - it was more about acrobatics than colossal heartbreak. Brunnhilde was perched high atop The Machine, and it wasn't even Voigt, but a double. It could've been so much better. For the best Wotan-Brunnhilde scene, you have to watch James Levine's previous endeavor with James Morris and Hildegard Behrens.",1443744000,,1212,5.126262626262626
8550999,5,B00AFOS9I6,"Loved the acting , singing, and the stage settings.",1437609600,,51,4.777777777777778
8551000,5,B00AFOS9I6,Great value!,1431820800,,12,5.5
8551001,5,B00AFOS9I6,"After the Met's last production there was a lot to live up to but Voight is at her best, along with Terfel.  Kaufmann and Westbroek are a wonderful, beautiful couple.  I misses Norman's chest tones but other than that stellar performances.  Great production!",1403308800,2,258,4.953488372093023
8551002,5,B00AFOS9I6,"Will this ever be available as a CD? I want the music, not the stage business. Why that awful end with Wotan dragging Brunhilde off right, then appearing high upstage center before laying Brunhilde down at such a precipitous angle you fear she will slide down and crash into the footlights, then a rather long wait before the rise of the fire, which, when it appears as an actual flame, looks like gas jets for a fake fireplace. Watch the magnificent (and schtick-free) end of the James Morris-Hildegard Behrens DVD, which shows how it should be staged.",1400112000,,553,4.711340206185567
8551003,4,B00AFOS9I6,"This performance, led by Jimmy Levine is sonically terrific.  Using DTS, the surround sound is excellent and the Met orchestra is outstanding.  The cast could not be better with excellent singing by all concerned.  The only reservation I have is the Le Page production.  It bis certainly more interesting than the old fashioned ones that have been around forever, but still have a problem imagining the locales using those tall steel planks.  It does make you concentrate on the music and the singing, which, after all is the primary reason for an opera, especially the Ring operas.",1398556800,3,582,4.958762886597938
8551004,5,B00AFOS9I6,"First and foremost I was very much intrigued and impressed by the imaginative staging of this production. It grabs you from the get go with Siegmund being pursued through the woods by his enemies. The singers were absolutely first class: Eva-Maria Westbroek with her amazing voice completely believable as Sieglinde, the duty bound and inexperienced wife of Hundig who feels drawn to Siegmund, her long lost twin brother. Jonas Kaufmann as Siegmund was at his best vocally. I thought. His ""Waelse calls"" long and powerful, his ""Winterstuerme wichen dem Wonnemond"" aria sung so beautifully. Deborah Voigt, Bryn Terfel, Stephanie Blythe- what a cast! And James Levine conducting, what more can you ask for? You will watch this DVD over and over, just like I'm doing.",1387411200,7,764,5.12
8551005,4,B00AFOS9I6,"Levine's conducting is wonderful, and Kaufmann is a great Siegmund. I liked the Sieglinde, too (Westbroek), and thought Deborah Voigt was a very fine Brunnhilde. The music is what counts here, and the use of close-ups makes the dreadful machine fairly easy to ignore.  -jdt",1371513600,2,273,5.066666666666666
