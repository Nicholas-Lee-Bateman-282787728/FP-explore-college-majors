6509647,5,B00LXGRR4W,it's good but i wish FUNimation would put one piece on prime,1413504000,,60,4.083333333333333

6509649,3,B00LXGRR4W,"These filler episodes lack the spark of the episodes adapted from the manga.  (They still have their moments, however!)  This story arc feels like a guest that's overstaying their welcome by a good amount.  I can't wait for the Part 13 collection to be released so we can move on from what feels like a slap-dash story.",1413158400,2,319,4.56140350877193
6509650,3,B00LXGRR4W,"The series as a whole is great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an action-packed series.

I had only one problem with this combo release: The Blu-Ray discs did not have working subtitles on them. The only thing that saved this purchase from being returned is that the DVD discs had the subtitles. So, if you are buying this combo for the Blu-Ray discs and want subtitles, you may want to skip this one.

Now, I will admit that I may have just gotten a bad set. I just wanted other customers to be aware of a possible problem.",1411948800,4,547,4.352941176470588
6509651,5,B00LXGRR4W,"In this volume of the series, our heroes have to come to terms with their loss to the Legion Platoon.  As usual, the defeat does not sit well with our heroes so they set out for Lucy's home in search of clues about the Infinity Clock.  In Lucy's home, Fairy Tail finds a clue, but so does the Legion Platoon.  This starts a race to find the remaining pieces of the Infinity Clock before time runs out (pun intended).  I won't give away much more about the plot, but the teams from Fairy Tail are new and create some very interesting and funny situations (one team is made up of all three exseeds).  If you have enjoyed the ride so far watching Fairy Tail, then this latest installment will not disappoint.",1411689600,2,705,4.351145038167939
6509652,5,B00LXGRR4W,I love this series I have purchased every set so far. However until the price goes goes down I will not be buying this and I urge others to do the same. I would be willing to pay $30-$35 for the set. But the price they are asking is insane for 12 episodes.,1411430400,7,256,3.849056603773585

6509717,4,B00LXGRR4W,"This is a good series, it filled the void that bleach left in me by its downward spiral in quality.  So far in this series there has only been two episodes I've had to fast forward past because the story and voice acting of the villain was terrible.  I enjoy the manga also but am kinda burned out on all the sexuality the author feels he needs to express.  I feel this story and the characters are strong enough on their own that they don't need panty shots and the nude scenes for shock factor.  Maybe the author is just sexually frustrated with his life and can only express those feelings through his manga?  I dunno but I'm not anti-sex its just this series is so neat and I feel it does not need any of that.",1439942400,,714,4.182481751824818

6509797,4,B00LXGRR4W,"I can't in the right mind give Fairy Tail a low review score, but out of all the FT DVD's this one has probably been my least favorite. Although it is exciting to see the utilize many of it's characters, especially ones like Gildarts, Lyon and others whom we don't get to see enough of. The over complex and just uninteresting story of this filler arc leaves more to be desired when compared to the rest of the Fairy Tail arcs. There is some draw to it I suppose, it's fun to see the characters set off together in teams of some our favorite pairings. And some of the new characters were neat, some of them kinda so so or annoying. Either way it's Fairy Tail so it's still good, just not up to par and if your going to get the whole show than you'll probably need this DVD.",1417219200,,773,4.16
