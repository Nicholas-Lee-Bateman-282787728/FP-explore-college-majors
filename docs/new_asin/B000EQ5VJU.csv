I THOUGHT THIS MATCH WAS GOING TO BE TERRIBLE AND IT WAS. THE ONLY REASON I CAN STAND TO WATCH IT IS BECAUSE BENOIT IS IN IT.

The main event, come on!!, JBL could just kicked his a#s, but he didnt, and at the end, the charity case, retains his belt.

NOTE: Rey Mysterio has just won like 1 match as the World Chimp, definitely making this belt a joke.  What a diference when the belt belonged to RAW.

In my opinion, Smackdown lacks talent, and now that RAW has Dx back, WOW!!, also you have all the great talent going to ECW, I think this might just be the end of Smackdown.",1150934400,,629,4.1735537190082646
2529325,4,B000EQ5VJU,"MNM vs London & Kendrick

Quite a good tag match. I was pleased with the result but found the aftermath slightly foolish. Still one of the better tag matches there have been lately though.

RATING: 78/100

Finlay vs. Benoit

This was a good, physical match that was successful but in some areas failed to keep me intrigued. Good quality wrestling throughout but at times lagged. Good length and some good innovative moves. Enjoyable match

RATING: 83/100

Jilian vs. Melina

A much better match than I was expecting between these two. I was pleasantly surprised. But still not enough to match Mickie vs. Trish of late.

RATING: 70/100

Helms vs Super Crazy

This was a highly enjoyable match with some wonderful high flying moves. At 10 minutes in length, it was of sufficient time duration. The ending could have been stronger but that is no real problem.

RATING: 80/100

Angle vs. Henry

I actually felt that this match was in a lot of ways better than there Royal Rumble match considering the way the match started at a very speedy pace and never really slowed down too much. The countout ending hurt the match a little bit as I think the aftermath should have probably been part of the match. I was impressed with Angle wrestling injured here.

RATING: 76/100

Booker T vs. Lashley

Before the match I was okay with a Booker win, but then I realised as the commentators stated it that I really don't want to hear Booker remind us every weak, so I suddenly sat on the edge of my seat hoping for a Lashley win. I was sure the match would belong to Lashley after his nice spear, but out of nowhere for no reason Finlay appeared and screwed Lashley. It seems as though the feud is back on, once again, out of nowhere.

RATING: 78/100

Khali vs. Undertaker

This match was poor. I wasn't expecting it to play out the way it did and I hated the sudden ending. Poor indeed.

RATING: 61/100

Rey vs JBL

I liked Rey's offense in the beginning of the match and I thoroughly enjoyed the ""fairytale"" ending. I like the fact that they made this a grueling championship match rather than a victory out of nowhere. And what I like the most is that Rey won and we will not have to suffer another long JBL reign!

RATING: 85/100

2529327,4,B000EQ5VJU,"London and Kendrick vs M&M: This is no doubt one of the best tag matches the WWE has had on a ppv in a long time. There's a lot of high flying action with many close pin-falls by both teams. I wanted to see this feud to continue to go on. There's now 2 reasons why it can't go on.
1.) The WWE unwisely broke-up M&M after the match, they do that to every talented tag team they have!
2.) Melina and Johny Nitro were later on fired by Teddy Long in an angle but while they a really suspened in real life for being trouble backstage and may either really get fired or just be suspended for a really long time.
That sucks though since who the hell is gonna replace M&M as the top heel tag team, Gemini ? haha, don't make me laugh. Anyway, great match but I would've loved for them to have an old school 2 out of 3 falls tag match at SummerSlam between both teams.
Winners and new champs: London and Kendrick ***1/2 out of ****

  Finley vs Beniot: This is great match with a lot of  brawling and technical wrestling involved. Beniot gets the deserved victory here with the crossface. With how tough Finley was this whole match though, you would think he wouldn't have tapped out so quickly. At least they were smart enough not to have Finley beat Beniot 2 times in a row. It was worse enough that WCW always had Finley beat Beniot as it is. Although it pisses me off less than seeing Beniot Job to other wrestlers since Finley can go and never lost a step.
Winner: Beniot  **** out of ****

  Melina vs Jillian: Jillian basically kicks Melina's sexy ass here, since Melina is being punished for her backstage attitude her and her b/f Johny Nitro give people.
Winner: Jillian ** out of ****

  Mark Henry vs Kurt Angle: There was no real need for Angle to be wasted against Hen rry again. I guess the 2 felt they could've gave a better match than what we got at the Royal Rumble though. We do get a better match too and in the end Angle shows how match of and animal he is by beating the living crap out of Henry. Otherwise the match is sort of a waste since Henry wins by count out I think. So we could see this feud on when Angle deserves sooooo much more.
Winner: Henry **1/2 out of ****

  Booker T. vs Lashley: There's a few reasons why I wanted to see Booker win this one. 1.) Lashley would just look silly with the crown on while Booker would ham it up and get some laughs
2.) I want to see Booker step up and get a shot at Rey at the Great American Bash!
Anyway both men put on a good match with Lashley getting screwed over by Finley. Booker then hits the axe kick for the win and yes he does ham it up with the crown and robe on until Lashley spears him.
Winner: Booker T. *** 1/2 out of ****

  The Great Khali vs the Undertaker: I figured this one would just end with a DQ but no Taker actually puts over a new guy for once. He basically lets Khali destroy him. I guess Taker is gonna come back at SummerSlam as a....Super Saiyan glowing with blonde hair and get the win lol. Hey that's how corny the Undertaker is. I don't care about Taker putting over Khali, as long as Beniot never has to. Anyway this match is sorta slow but still sorta fun watching Taker get dominated for once.
Winner: The Great Khali *** out of ****

  JBL vs Rey: This isn't a bad match but Rey still doesn't work that well for me as World champ. Anyway Rey and JBL work well together of course and this match has a lot of action. Rey finally wins and then Chavo comes out, I was hoping he'd lay-out Rey but that never happens lol.

2529328,3,B000EQ5VJU,"Judgement Day had some of the weirdest moments in recent memory as one of the best recent tag teams broke up, and by the looks of it for good, as Melina and Nitro were fired from the WWE! Also the King Of The Ring Tournament finals were decided as Booker T won the first KOTR since 2002. Also the Great Khali was surprisingly victorious over the dead man and Rey Mysterio retained the title against JBL, using Eddie Guerrero's own move!

WWE Tag Team Championships

MNM [Champions] vs. Brian Kendrick and Paul London:

Great start to the show, both teams worked well together. A lot of tag team action as MNM taunted the crowd as London and Kendrick struggled to gain the upper hand. London even sent Kendrick over the top rope in a hilo type move onto MNM outside the ring. Melina interferes and even though she's hot I wished she'd stop that damn screaming! The ending came when Mercury went to hit London, but London moved and Mercury hit Nitro by mistake and London scored the pin on Mercury. 8/10

[After the match MNM attack each other and Teddy Long even got involved!]

Chris Benoit vs. Fit Finlay:

Another hard hitting, intense match between these two. Both men use submission wrestling at the beginning and Finlay even tries to use a steel chair, but Benoit hits a baseball slide and sends the chair right into Finlay's face. The action continues and Finlay tired to hit Benoit again with his club, but Benoit ducks and gives Finlay a german suplex on the floor! Finlay fires back and sends Benoit into the steel steps, but later in the ring Benoit makes Finlay tap out to the crossface! 8.5/10 [Solid match between these two.]

Jillian Hall vs. Melina:

It's nice to see a women's match in which the women try to wrestle as they learn the moves. Some hair pulling and some fighting on the outside and Jillian gets the win even though Melina had her hand on the ropes. 6/10 [Very short match.]

WWE Cruiserweight Championship

Gregory Helms [Champion] vs. Super Crazy:

A great, fast paced match. Seems like there were a lot of neckbreakers in the beginning, but both men fight back with fast paced, more exciting moves. A huge ECW chant starts for Super Crazy as both men move on to roll ups and arm drags in the match. One moment that was cool was when Helms hit a neckbreaker type move off the second rope for only a two count. The match ends when Helms hit a big powerbomb on Super Crazy for the three count with his feet on the ropes. 7/10 [Could have been longer, not too many high risk moves, but still a pretty good match.]

Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry:

Before the match started, Henry cleared off the announce table at ringside and taunted Angle. As much as I like Kurt, not even he can make Henry look that good. The fight is basically Angle trying to survive as Henry constantly kicks him in the ribs and even stands on his ribs at one point. Angle tried to suplex Henry through the announce table, but Henry powered out and threw Angle into the ring. Angle then managed to hit the Angle Slam, but Henry kicks out. The end comes when Henry put Angle on the announce table to splash him through it, but Angle moved and Henry splashed Angle against the ring post and Angle got counted out. 5/10 [I think their Royal Rumble match was even better than this waste of time.]

After the match Angle snapped and attacked Henry with a steel chair as officials tried to break up the fight. Angle even Angle Slams Henry on the announce table, which didn't break, but did when Angle hit Henry with another chair shot and Henry fell face first on the table and it broke.

King Of The Ring Finals

Booker T vs. Lashley:

Okay match but to me it would mean more if Raw had a chance to send a superstar to face a Smackdown superstar for the throne. Anyway a lot of back and forth action between these two and both men even send the other face first into the steel steps. Sharmell interferes, yet again, by holding onto Lashley's leg as he tries to spear Booker T at one point. The end comes when Finlay comes out again and nails Lashley with his club to allow Booker T to win and become the new KOTR. 8/10 [Okay match but I expected a little bit more.]

After the match Booker T sits on the throne but Lashley spears him and topples the chair over as both men fall to the floor!

The Great Khali vs. The Undertaker:

If you've seen No Way Out 2003, when Taker faced the Big Show, this is sort of like part two. Big man moves and Khali kept throwing Taker out of the ring with one arm tosses. Khali even sent Taker knees first into the steel steps. Taker fought back and even managed to hit Old School and tie Khali into the ropes. Daivari interfered and Taker chased him away, but not before Khali got out of the ropes and nailed Taker with a big boot for the win. 6.5/10 [Not very good and another short match! Khali won, didn't see that coming...]

World Heavyweight Championship

Champion vs. Champion

Rey Mysterio [Champion] vs. JBL [United States Champion]:

JBL starts by talking trash to Mysterio, and Mysterio responds by slapping the disrespect out of him! JBL used a lot of hard hitting moves such as working on the back of Mysterio, but Mysterio responds with some high flying moves like a cross body off the top rope and even a baseball slide to JBL's groin!

JBL fights back and sends Mysterio into the steel steps. JBL fights back and even busts Mysterio wide open. JBL mocks Rey's wife and puts Rey's bloodied head close to Rey's wife, scaring her and showing much dis-respect. JBL went for a steel chair but Rey drop kicked the chair into JBL's face and then hit the frog splash for the win. 9/10 [Good match]

I recommend this for the Benoit/Finlay match, the tag team match, and the world heavyweight championship match. Although those matches were good, the women's match, Khali/Taker, and Henry/Angle brought the level down a bit. Okay SD ppv to rent, but think twice before ordering it.

2529330,3,B000EQ5VJU,"Judgement Day 2006 has a really boring line up

First of all let me make a prediction of todays smackdown 19/05/2006

JBl called Vince on Raw this week to suggest something which vince liked

I bet wot JBL said was who Rey Mysterio's opponent shud be on smackdown

Come on who cud it be sumone big, on raw and its is MAY 19th!!!

yep i bet JBl has chosen Kane to face mysterio on smakdown and vince will come to smakdown to announce the match

Kane will come out and they will destory mysterio

now that is sumthn im certain will happen well almost certain

BUT  what i also hope will happen is this:

during the match the voice ""may 19th"" he hears starts again and kane begings to go crazy (with his bad acting and why does he always 4get his other contact lense???) and starst to attack mysterio when all of a sudden the lights go out and we here the Gong

Undertaker comes and we finally get told by whoever wot happend on may 19th. im guessin its wen undertaker supposedly burnt their parents alive and whn kane face got burnt. at first i thought may 19th was when kane took his mask off but it wasnt

bak 2 judgement day

1) MNM vs London & Kendrcik (WWE Tag titles)

shud be good match with high flying moves and fats paced action i think london and kendrick will win

2) Benoit vs Finlay - boring Finlay will cheat to win as usual

3) Super Crazy vs Gregory helms (Cruiserweight title)

shud be another high flying match i think helms may retain

4) Gillian vs Melina

both cant wrestle and only meila is nicne to look at

5) Booker T vs Lashley (KOTR Finals)

Booker will win and become KOTR 2006 he kinda deseves it tho wil be an ok match Sharmell will interfere as usual

6) Angle vs Henry (Batisa returnn)

this will be an awful match Hnery cant hold a match and will be just as slow and boring as the Royal Rumble match I think Batista will return and take is revenge on Henry. Or mayb orton will return and get his revenge on Angle for breaking his ankle

7) Undertaker vs Great Khali

this will be interesting to woch. I have a feeling Khali will win or get DQ'd WWE will try to giv him a big push will be interstn match to see how WWE will play this one

8) JBl vs Mysterio (World Title)

its a clash of styles here

JBL is horribly boring to watch as he cant hold any match (and wot is up with that flabby belly its gross) and mysterio is excellnt to watch. Myserio will retain with mayb help of Batista (JBl cant be champion again can he... is he married to steph aswell???)

Judgement day shud be ok mayb bettr that last yeasr cos Cena is not in main event (mind u any main event without Cena in it is a privallege to watch)",1147996800,,2642,4.145669291338582

World Heavyweight Championship match

(C) Rey Mysterio Vs. Mark Henry

This is obviously going to be a horrible match, Rey still comes out on top with the help of Batista who gets his revenge on Henry  which will cause a fued storyline between the 2 at the next ppv.

winner:Rey Mysterio retains

KOTR Finals of the tournament

___Booker T Vs. Chris Benoit___

Booker t say th least is a terrific wrestler WWE hasn't fully sprung out his abilities but he has the image. During the past months Booker has been on a losing streak, he even lost to newcomers. When he came out on SD! saying he was going to be the 2006 KOTR you don't want to believe it but its true. In fact this is how it goes down, He beats Matt Hardy, then defeats Angle because of JBL's interference,and meet Benoit in the Finals. This should be a very solid and enthusiastic match up not to mention the rivalry between the 2 in the past. Booker T some how will become the KOTR 2006 and this will give Booker T his Champion image and he will start a rivaly with Rey Mysterio.

WINNER OF THE KOTR2006: Booker T.

The Giant Khali w/ Daivari Vs. The Undertaker

The Undertaker my favorite! but look at that monster i never seen  something like it and if you think he's another Giant Gonzolez think again this is a very  athletic wrestler he will man handle the undertaker burying him beneath the ring when its all set and done. Winner: The Great Giant Khali

United States Championship Iron Man's Match

JBL (United States Champion)Vs. Kurt Angle

Kurt Angle has been doing good so far but JBL is starting to raise up again too so these two will fued against each other in a grueling 60 minute iron man match for the United States Championship, needless to say Angle wins but somehow that JBL will get the last pinfall(JBL will become the 1 contender for Rey Mysterio's title)Winner: Still Champion JBL

Great Duo of lashley and hardy i imagine, but MNM is even more advanced than the bad half of the hardy boyz and a replica brock lesnar Winners: MNM

The Return of Shannon Moore

Vs. Gregory Helms (C)

After being released form the WWE in 2004 Shannon moore found better places he even managed to snag a free lance contract with new up rising wrestling promotion TNA because he wasn't on a permenent contract with TNA Moore could leave and he did by sneaking back to the WWE. So he returns and starts competing against old time WCW partner, and current Cruiserweight champion Gregory Helms also known as the Gimmick figure The Hurricane. Anyway Shannons return is electric but he's no match for the Sugar Shane! Winner: Gregory Helms retains

Paul Burchill with/ Miss Regal

Vs. Finlay

Paul Burchill, anothe rup rising star on SD! i thought would have been perfect with Regal as partners after all Regal worked with Tajiri and, Eugene..I also thought they would meet MNM at WM22 that never happened cause WWE wanted Regal to turn heel so they turned him against Burchill, Because of Regal losing to Burchill in a match recently Regal must wear women's clothing untill he is beaten. Finlay a tough lad comes in the picture and will defeat Paul Burchill, William Regals debt will be terminated and Finlay and Regal will join forces as a new Tag Team. Winner: Finlay",1144972800,,3537,4.592356687898089
2529352,2,B000EQ5VJU,"Judgement Day 2006 is going to be THE worst pay per view in WWE/F history by far. The main event is a match we saw last year at No Mercy, which was easily forgettable, and since 3 of Smackdown's main stars are injured/suspended (Batista, Angle, Orton) there is no hope for this event at all. I like JBL, don't get me wrong, he's a wrestling god, but he still won't make it a good main event, espcially since the midget is in it. JBL should win the title, and be a double chamion. Another thing to pile on JBL's ego which would be brilliant.

Then there's the fact the if the WWE had common sense, they could add such performers as Benoit, Booker T or The Undertaker to the main event for a triple threat or something, but WWE won't do that because that means two triple threat main events in a row. The Undertaker now has to put up with a horrible, horrible wrestler which is managed by the useless Davairi, who has a nack for managing bad wrestler (Mark Henry). Taker is a sure fire main eventer, but they don't use the oppurtunity when they need it most which is a shame. Then Benoit is being put with below mid-carders like Finlay trying to make ""stars"" out of them which is no way going to happen, which means benoit isn't ever going to hit the main events again which is a shame. With him as champion, I got back into watching WWE in April 2004. Then Booker T, who is jobbing to utterly rubbish wrestlers such as The Boogeyman, will probably job again to someone in the King Of The Ring finals (probably Lashley) at JD. I can't believe the push they're giving Lashley so quickly. He is no way going to become the next Brock Lesnar.

I think it's inevitable that MnM vs Kendrick and London will happen, and we've seen it before many times on Smackdown, so it'll be same-o, but it will probably be match of the night, due to the trash the other matches will be. A nice, possibly ladder stipulation will save the ppv, but WWE probably won't do that either. A superstar I like is Paul Burchill (not because I'm English myself) since he has major charisma, and I can see him making an impact in a match at Judgement Day, but I could be wrong. At No Way Out, we saw most of the cruiserweights compete in the same match, at the same time, so I don't see how they can do one better, but they need to do something inventive so the match will be alright. I don't (like most people) don't want to see a one-on-one match, we want to see loads of high flying moves and stuff.  I guess Mark Henry will be put in this PPV somewhere because they have no other choice, but all I can see is him kicking someone like Matt Hardy's rear end. A match no-one wants to see, even if you're not a Matt Hardy fan.

What I did want to see out of Judgement Day was perhaps, if Kurt retained the title, was a Taker vs Angle ironman match or something which would be the greatest match in history, but I understand Kurt has to heal. One thing I do not, at all under any circumstances, want to see at Judgement Day is Booker T vs Benoit, because we have seen it literally 300 times before, although they usually are good, and no disrespect, we need a change.

I predict with the trade drafts, Edge will come to Smackdown, since he is the only logical person to, and he will save the show everytime, and they will put the belt on him without a doubt. Also I see (hopefully) Mark Henry to RAW, since he has nothing to do on Smackdown, and no-one wants him there.

Message to WWE: Stop overshadowing Smackdown as a #2 promotion. Sure, at Survivor Series, you tried to make it look the best, but in all honesty you know it's not, and all the ""legends"" and people always to spots on RAW and do matches on RAW, but never for Smackdown. They've got to realise there are two brands to deal with. Bring back Kennedy......Kennedy!

8113121,4,B000EQ5VJU,"MNM ""with Melina"" VS Kendrick and London: A good way go start the PPV. Melina is hot but I wish she would stop yelling. London and Kendrick win the belts in the end.

Finlay VS Chris Beniot: Since Beniot's death I have not watched a full match of his. I agree both men are two of the greatetst wrestlers in the history of the WWE.

Jillian Hall VS Melina: Skip

Gregory Helms VS Super Crazy: Crowd seemed dead during this match but the camera panned on about six men chanting Super Crazy. Decent match but the ending sucked.

Kurt Angle VS Mark Henry: Hard to believe Henry has been with the WWE for almost 15 years while more talented wrestlers get released. Anyways, this match sucked. The aftermath was going fine until Angle went for the angle slam on Henry thru the announcers table, but the annouce table didn't break. This sucked.

Booker T VS Bobby Lashley: I don't care for either man but Booker is at least entertaining. Anyways, Finaly interferes and costs Lashley the match. Lashley attacks Booker as he gets the cape and crown.

Great Khali VS Undertaker: An instant classic! This match had it all! Are you kidding me? This match sucked beyond belief. Taker has never squared off against a man over 400 lbs. Maybe a match against the Big Show. Anyways, I would skip this at all costs.

Rey Mysterio VS JBL: Thanks to Guerrero's death (sorry that was rude but true), Mysterio won the Royal Rumble and the world title. I enjoy Rey but he is certainly is no world champion. Smackdown kept Eddie Guerrero's memory alive but heel wrestlers mocking him such as JBL. JBL pulls off a few Eddie moves and mannerisms in the match. It was a typical Mysterio match but still enjoyable.

Overall, a mixed bag. Matches are half good, half bad but I would recommend it",1276473600,,1766,4.531446540880503

8113124,4,B000EQ5VJU,"My SmackDown PPV streak continues as this was the fourth SmackDown PPV in a row that was overall a great PPV.  In ways, it's ironic that WWE focuses more on RAW but yet, SmackDown PPV's are better quality than the RAW ones in the past year.

WWE Tag Team Champions MNM vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London - Great tag team match and one of the best ones in WWE in recenty memory.  Honestly, I'm not acting like it's the greatest of all time but it's really a great match but unfortunally, it also ended with the breakup of MNM.

Chris Benoit vs. Finlay - This match is a perfect for those who are fans of professional wrestling (not sports entertainment) and gave you a great mat based wrestling match.

Jillian Hall vs. Melina - This was a good womens match & one of the best ones in the past year.  Little people know that Melina & Jillian are trained to wrestle so you don't have to expect any of that T&A wrestling that Torrie & Candice or sit through a horrible match like you see with the diva search girls do.

Crusierweight Champion Gregory Helms vs. Super Crazy - Crazy is one of the most underutilized wrestlers in WWE today while you don't see alot of Gregory Helms these days eventhough he's Crusierweight Champion so this was the ""sleeper"" match of the night as these two put on a great show as Crazy does his lucha style while Helms uses at his mat wrestling.  This was one of the matches that proves if WWE was to push this division more than what they normally do now, it clearly has the possibility to overshadow TNA's X Division.

Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry - Just like most Mark Henry matches, it's good if the other wrestler does alot of selling & the match is short.  This was no exception as Angle sold his injured ribs while Henry just beat him down.  The match result was kinda jip (nobody pays money to see DQ & countout endings) but the attack afterwards made up for it.

King Of The Ring Final: Bobby Lashley vs. Booker T - Both men brought their A game here & put on the best match possible.  ALL HAIL KING BOOKER!

Undertaker vs. Great Khali - All I'm gonna say about this is that Taker did his best but Khali just sucks period.  It was basically Khali countering all of Taker's offence while getting in a few WEAK punches and kicks here & there.  It's watchable & Khali is at least better than Kenzo Suzuki so I've seen worse so I'll give the match some credit.

WWE Champion Rey Mysterio vs. J.B.L. - This match was a step below their match months ago at No Mercy because throughout Mysterio's whole title reign, he was booked as the underdog because of his size instead of being able to hold his own.  JBL dominated the match with Mysterio making the big comeback.

DVD extras included a quick backstage confrontation between Chavo & Eddie's widow Vicki Guerrero, an interview with Khali & Davari, and Booker being crowned King Booker on SmackDown!

Again a PPV that I can watch over & over again, recommended.",1157328000,7,2937,4.393715341959335

A great tag team match that has you sitting on the edge of your seat.

One of the best matches of the night. A great opener.

2. Chris Benoit vs. Finlay

I was expecting a good match ""and you know what this was an excellent

Match."" This was a brilliant technical match between the two and match of the night.

The same as any women's match.

CRUISEWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:

4. Gregory Helms (C) vs. Super Crazy

RATING: 7/10

An ok match that could have been better. I was really looking forward  for this

match too. Did not feel like a cruiserwieght match.

5. Henry vs. Angle

RATING: 6.5 /10

Better than there match at the Royal Rumble. The count out ruined it.

KOTR FINAL:

6. Booker T vs. Lashley

RATING: 7.5/10

This was a good match that I enjoyed. It could have been better.

7. Undertaker vs. The Great Khali

RATING: -0/10

This match sucked big time. Great Khali is a horrible wrestler and should get

Fired fast. This match ruined the PPV for me. He made the Under Taker look bad.

So just SKIP this match.

WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:

8. Rey Mysterio (C) vs. JBL

RATING: 8/10

A good main event from Smackdown.

I didn't think it was going to be this good.
