This film is for younger kids, yes, but it's a fun adventure for the entire family! It includes many cute animals and very unique animation. Some examples of the animals are bees, flies, cats, and dogs. Even bunnies and pigs too! Good bye humans, hello animal's world! The movie was recorded in a different language but the dubbed English version makes you feel like you're really listening to the original language, which I greatly enjoyed! Also it is very fun because a boy cat and a girl dog are best friends. Even though it is for little children, I enjoyed the concept of this unusual in our world friendship. The fun begins somewhere in Europe in a village called Gadgetville where inventing is very popular and there is a big inventing competition every year. A very famous dog inventor, whose name is Oskar (Lembit Ulfsak) has a daughter whose name is Lotte (Evelin Pang).  She is always exited and is a bit of a trouble maker too. She reminds you of a very sweet version of Dennis the Menace. When dogs have fun in water, Lotte finds a wet book and lets it dry. When it finishes drying, she finds there's a bee that was trapped in the book. The entire town goes through lots of fun with this bee who's from Japan! And also the gang goes to a Judo Tournament. Now if you want to find out if they won the tournament and if the bee got home safely, you must watch the movie.

>What I love about this movie is endless! It's bright, it's fun and it's hilarious as well! Even though all of this is good, if you're older than 7 or 8, this movie may not appeal to you. But if you are younger than 7, this movie is perfect! It has no harsh language, no action, no intense scenes, but it also keeps you at the edge of your seat with a wonderful and light storyline and bright animation. It also teaches kids a number of very valuable lessons such as to be friendly with others regardless of what they look like and where they came from. After all, Lotte is a dog but she has a cat for her best friend and welcomes a Japanese bee and his culture into her house. As a youth activist myself, I can truly appreciate the concept of teaching kids to be kind to one another.

My favorite scene is when the Lotte and her dog friend are at a little tree house. They are just chatting and Lotte wants to practice diving, but the cat boy is not allowed to do any sports. Lotte says the fish are talking and then she jumps and drags the cat boy with her. Since this movie is for much younger kids I would say it is appropriate for ages 5 to 8. This movie is currently available on DVD at Kidflix Global. I give this movie 5 out 5 stars because it is so likable and very well done.<
