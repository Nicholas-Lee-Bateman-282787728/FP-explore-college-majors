1073711,4,630580706X,"This film is well worth seeing just on its merit as a comedy.  Many of the jokes remind me of THE SIMPSONS (a _good_ thing), and yet the film definitely transcends these limits.
The questions about and examination  of identity, infatuation, sexual desire, and the value of one's life are  there in spades, though no clear resolution comes of it.  (Not a bad thing,  just an observation.)
Some of the camera work is simply stunning, esp.  the opening sequence and John Malkovich's ""dance"" sequence.  If  you appreciate cinematography and crisp direction, this film will be right  up your alley.
Sorry for the disjointed review ... just my thoughts on  this film off the top of my head.",953510400,2,684,4.769230769230769
1073712,5,630580706X,"When I, an out of work puppeteer, got my first job on the 7 1/2th floor of a New York office building, I too found a portal into the mind of a celebrity for 15 minutes, after which I was cast out somewhere on the  Jersey Turnpike....
Okay, I really can't relate to this, but who could?  This movie is so utterly obscure and wonderful and confusing and  non-sensical, that it is certain to make you laugh. True, the character's  could have been sceptical when John Cusack tells them of his discovery,but  that would make this movie silly...
This movie, riddled with marvelous  performances and directing, may very well be the silliest, and is certainly  one of the most wonderful movies of all time.",953164800,,698,4.580645161290323

1073714,5,630580706X,"This movie is so inventive that you'll wonder how screenwriter Charlie Kaufman thought of the concept. The plot is nearly indescribable, it has something to do with a portal at floor 7 that leads into the mind of actor  John Malkovich for 15 minutes and then dumps you on some spot in the  highway, sound weird? it is, but the plot is beside the point. It is  thoroughly original, funny and entertaining. John Cusack is great as the  pathetic pupeteer, and Cameron Diaz shows she can take good career risks  with this unusual role for her. But it is Catherine Keener and John  Malkovich who give the film is's flavor. Keener is the ultimate object of  desire for everyone in the film and she delivers very funny lines and gives  the best performance in the cast. John Malkovich is also very funny playing  himself, showing us that you can deliver a good performance even if you're  playing an 'actor named John Malkovich'. Great movie, one of the best of  1999. See it. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9!",952646400,2,1013,4.48087431693989
1073715,4,630580706X,"What would you expect from a movie in which someone finds, in the seventh and a half floor of a building, a kind of portal to the mind of the actor John Malkovich that makes it possible, for those who enter, to see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, for fifteen minutes? A lot of  creativity, isn't it? That's it! I'm not kidding! This movie really exists  and it is called ""Being John Malkovich"". And, if there is one  movie that we can call creative, this is the one.
""Being John  Malkovich"" is probably the most creative film ever made. Directed by  the video maker Spike Jonze, it will prove to you that being your own self  is the best idea, even if you ever wanted to be someone else, with a  brilliant and extremely original screenplay that surprises you from the  beginning until the last minute of the film. What about John Malkovich  being John Malkovich? Got confused? Watch the  movie and you will be asking yourself how can a person create such a  creative movie.

1073846,2,630580706X,"Being John Malkovich is my all-time favorite film - this review is in reference to the Criterion edition.  Like most criterions, some of the special features are obviously filler, here you get a short doc on puppetry to that effect.  The interview insert is a pointless self-indulgent piece by rag-mag personality Perkus Tooth, ostensibly interviewing Spike Jonze, but as the entire piece is a joke and Jonze' responses are never more than a single line, it feels more like being trolled.  By far the biggest disaster, however, is the commentary track.  Neither Jonze nor Kaufmann were available for Criterion's time table, apparently, so they sat down filmmaker rival Michel Gondry for about 40 mins to do a ""select-scene commentary"".  The result is embarassing.  Gondry forgets the names of actors, wonders aloud if they're dead now, asks aloud why he's doing the commentary and whether his will be the only one on the dvd (he hopes not, so did we).  He's also unbearable sexist.  At one point he actually calls Jonze up and says ""I've run out of s--t to say, any ideas?""  The phone call lasts the rest of the commentary; if Jonze was able to take the phone call, why wasn't he able to do the commentary?  There are only two positives to this edition:  the 4K remastering, and the (too brief) behind-the-scenes doc.  If you already have the BR in another edition, or you want to upgrade the DVD, then it's recommended with gross reservations.",1484438400,3,1444,4.801619433198381

1074056,5,630580706X,"Centers around three main characters: Craig (John Cusack), Maxine (Catherine Keener), and John Malkovich (himself). Craig takes a job at Lestercorp where Maxine also works, and he can't resist feeling an attraction for her. She flaunts her sexuality at him; she's a tease, and he desperately wants to consummate an affair with her. Maxine is intimately involved with John Horatio Malkovich, one of the most renown American actors of the 20th Century. Craig is obsessed and quite by accident discovers a portal, a channel, into the body of Malkovich. Craig then gets to fulfill his lustful desires and experience the erotic pleasures of lovemaking with Maxine vicariously through Malkovich.",1465084800,,689,5.330275229357798

There's definitely some unique twists and morals to be learned about human nature, need vs. greed, self-loathing, living and the quest for immortality through a very different form of living vicariously.  An ensemble cast of talented actors tops it off and you will be astonished, amused and surprised throughout the story.",1463097600,,670,5.081818181818182

Let me just say that he's a sport for going along with all of this!  John Cusack always does a wonderful job of playing a douche-bag and doesn't hold back in this role.

1074162,2,630580706X,"The entire movie really struck me as a 'way too Hollywood liberal' and basically immorally focused movie.  It seemed that every character in the movie was overly self absorbed and selfish to  the point of extreme narcissism!  It had some 'cute' moments and it was a clever movie concept but overall it was a dud for me. And the strange focus on the transgender and lesbian aspects really didn't add to the production in my estimation, but it did give a fine example of how Hollywood likes to insert the LGBT agenda into their productions without being upfront about it. And Cameron Diaz as Lotte Schwarz reminded me of way too many 'out there' liberals with her outrageous motherhood toward the chimp and her animal collection ... of course implying that she wanted to get married and have kids but wouldn't go about it directly because she was such a non-confrontational liberal. Not sure why this won any Academy Awards but the acting overall was good in terms of 'doing what was called for in the script'.  The best performance seemed to be Katherine Keener as Maxine, but many others were also good. The best scene was Malkovich in the Malkovich restaurant! I have better ways to waste my time than watching weirdness like this. I enjoy lots of forms of weird movies but this was not it for me!  I prefer 'weirdness' like Ex Machina, Serendipity, The Meaning of Life, Oh Lucky Man, Dark Matter, Clockwork Orange, The Machine (2013), Uncanny, Blade Runner and the like where the movie is not trying to socially engineer you, but just show you some thought provoking alternatives to our reality.

1074269,5,630580706X,"Being John Malkovich is very memorable, and is an even better film than it gets credit for. Somehow what should be dark and unsettling ends up instead as being mysterious and funny (mostly funny). The story is intriguing, and while it does not come off completely, it scores way more points with its audacity and inventiveness than it loses in other places. The directing is also very good, and various shots and effects (the portal into Malkovich and the drop out) stick out in my mind as very well done. The acting is comical, but otherwise hard to comment on, because the characters, while they are somewhat true-to-life, do not have all that much depth. This is not so much a negative, since more in-depth characters would make for a less funny and more unsettling experience. Overall, the film presents itself like an M.C. Escher drawing: anyone can enjoy it as it is, and for people that want to look deeper, there is plenty to be found in its themes of identity, control, and relation, and one can as well appreciate the craftmanship that went into it.",1450310400,,1059,4.668449197860962

 I found all the characters (beside John Malkovich and the chimpanzee) as rather horrible, shallow, manipulative unlikeable disgusting individuals, what disturbed me the most was the repeated ""mind rape"" of John Malkovich, this was horrible in the extreme and was masked under the veil of black comedy and art!

1074758,5,630580706X,"It's unjust to review this film after only one viewing, but here we go anyway. Being John Malkovich, the world's first glimpse at Charlie Kaufman's brilliant and twisted mind, is an incredibly original and confident debut. If a lesser writer were to tackle the same exact premise of this film, the results would probably be disastrous and nonsensical. The triumph of the film is mostly due to Kaufman's belief and dedication to his off-the-wall material. He handles big philosophical ideas through elements of humor, fantasy, and escapism, a wonderful clash of styles. Chock full of symbolism, most of it dealing with manipulation, lack of identity, and repression, Being John Malkovich is one of those films a hip professor would show their students in a philosophy/film course 101 and murder it through dissection. Spike Jonze also made an auspicious feature length debut with this film. Whereas Kaufman is most creative on the page, Jonze's field of comfort is the screen, and he proves that with his unique camerawork and strong visual eye. His brilliance shines through in the directing of the puppeteering scenes and most prominently, the sequence in which Lotte and Maxine enter into and travel through Malkovich's subconscious. And the acting, my god! John Cusack is hilarious and pathetic as a very David Foster Wallace-esque character. Cameron Diaz is surprisingly great as Cusack's animal-loving and possibly transsexual wife. Catherine Keener's screen presence is enormous as the seductive and bazaar Maxine. And shining with his name in the title, John Malkovich gives a stunning performance in probably one of the strangest roles an actor can take in his career. He channels a pitiful puppeteer channeling Malkovich with eery exactitude. Orson Bean is also wonderful as a 105 year-old bodysnatcher and Charlie Sheen is great at being Charlie Sheen. The Coen Brothers' chief film composer, Carter Burwell, offers up a great classical piano score that perfectly suits the haunting nature of the film. Being John Malkovich is full of surprises. Not gimmicky M. Night Shyamalan twists, but meaningful and strange surprises that add layers of depth to an already deep story. It's all in a day's work for Charlie Kaufman, and the cast and crew who worked on the film couldn't have been any better. Bravo!",1402358400,3,2312,5.168

You can watch the films in order or mix them up. My preference is to begin with Adaptation, which easily merges with Being John Malkovich. Neither one is the normal Hollywood movie. In fact they don't even come close.
Being John Malkovich, which debuted at the end of the 20th Century, was seen by more people.
Many of the actors in the films were cast in roles that would not have been expected. Meryl Streep is a good example. Nicolas Cage was cast in a role similar to his performance in the Coen Brothers' film Raising Arizona.

This cast performs flawlessly especially Malkovich, and the direction adds to the mood and strangeness that this film depicts. Being John Malkovich asks the question what it is that drives man. This question is handled both on literal levels and figurative levels, which results in the comedy of the film. What frightens me is the lengths people are willing to go to to find happiness. Everyone is willing to simply overtake Malkovich to make a little extra money, be with another person, or live another 44 years. All of the characters are extraordinarily self centered, and ultimately that is what makes the story thought provoking.

Of course there are moments when the film is far fetched, its premise is nutty and characters are a little too willing to believe in the impossible things happening around them. Not a single person questions Craig Schwartz (Cusack) after he first enters the mind of John Malkovich and goes telling everyone about it, the people he confides in simply take it at face value.

That out of the way, the movie itself is as good as ever, and could also be found in a non-Criterion DVD edition, so what makes this particular Disk worth buying are the extras you really can't get anywhere else.

The highlight of the package has to be Lance Bang's Making of Doc of the movie. Called ""All Noncombatants Please Clear the Set"" (for reasons we find out while watching), it diverges from the classic formula in that there's no talking head interviews or sappy reminiscing to push the movie itself. Instead what we get is a true behind-the-scenes look at what the set was probably like. One of the best parts has to be when Catherine Keener gets an injury and is replaced by someone, who while might seem weird for the role, makes a lot of practical sense.

In fact that's most likely the best way to describe this movie and this package in general. Being John Malkovich might be weird, odd, and zany but it's handled and made with care and thought, which oozes out of this 2 Disk Collection and given the movie itself, makes sense.

1074929,4,630580706X,"Being John Malkovich(released Oct/99)stars John Cusack as Craig Schwartz,Cameron Diaz plays Lotte Schwartz, Catherine Keener plays Maxine Lund,Orson Bean plays Dr. Lester,and of course John Malkovich as himself. Shot in the late 90s when Malkovich's career was quite hot,I found this strange and off the wall film is SO strange,it was good. This was director Spike Jonze's directorial,feature film,debut. Jonze has done for film,thematically at least,what Spike Jones did for music.
The story here starts with the life of a struggling artist/puppeteer,Craig. He is married to Lotte who owns a menagerie of animals,not the least of which is a chimp who has ""issues"".Out of work,Craig finally applies for a real job,which takes him to the 7 and 1/2 floor of an old office building in NYC.The boss there is one Dr Lester,a kind old man,whose secretary has a doctorate in speech impedimentology(?),but has trouble understanding the simplest of phrases.
Craig meets and falls hard for a woman who works on the that floor,Maxine. His feelings are unrequited,and he has to work through them through his puppets at night. One day he drops a file behind a cabinet. He pulls it out only to discover a trapped door. Behind that is a tunnel/portal which he soon discovers leads directly into the mind of John Malkovich. After about 15 minutes in his mind,one is deposited beside the busy New Jersey Turnpike. He tells his wife,who takes the ""plunge""also. She will repeat the process and come to think she should really be a woman. That is because Maxine,who Craig has told also,has actually gone through the portal and gone out with John in person. However Lotte was in John's mind at that time and she has fallen hard for Maxine,and Maxine has developed affections for Lotte also.
Craig and Maxine have,in the interim,set up a business on the side of allowing people to enter the portal for $200 a pop. Craig gets jealous of the time Maxine and his wife spend together and he locks his wife up temporarily in the chimp cage. Craig has newly discovered that he can now control the amount of time he spends in J.M.'s body,and Maxine and he become an item. Lotte escapes her imprisonment and heads for Dr Lester's home. On a previous visit she had noticed a room full of pictures of Malkovich. She now asks him what his interest in him is. He explains that he has been going from one body to the next for over a hundred years now and that he,and others that he has chosen,will transfer inside J.M's mind on the day of his 44th birthday. Lester invites her to accompany them.
Craig/Malkovich and Maxine eventually marry and have a child. Craig has removed Malkovich from his acting to career to pursue an overly successful career in puppeteering. On his 44th birthday he receives a call from Lester demanding he get out of Malkovich's mind or else Maxine will die. It is a bluff,but in the end it works. Lester and his friends enter J.M's mind on schedule. The film ends as we see the couple Maxine and Lotte on a beach with Maxine's daughter. From inside the girl's mind we hear Craig longing for the affections of Maxine.
What a plot,eh? It sounds so bizarre retelling it,but you really have to see it to believe it. There are so many neat touches such as Malkovich's close friend Charlie Sheen,popping in and out of the film from time to time. And watch for the pre-911 NYC skyline with the twin towers in evidence. Director Jonze does a nice job of layering the film. He slowly introduces us to his main characters and their quirks,allowing time for us to believe what we see,then builds upon the foundation,ending at the most quirkiest and dizziest heights I have ever seen. Also there is a point in the film where Malkovich actually enters his own mind,and what a hoot that turns out to be.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is quite clear. Extras abound here and include several featurettes,along with the trailer and commentary.
All in all a nice but bizarre film that will certainly have you scratching your head at times. I found the plot so out there,so off the wall and different that I liked it. Recommended.",1353974400,,4134,4.727146814404432

This guy accidentally finds a ""portal"" into the mind of John Malkovich.  Yes, THAT John Malkovich.  You know, the guy in that spy movie.

From Beastie Boys ""Sabotage"", R.E.M.'s ""Parallel"" to Bjork's ""Volumen"", Jonze would get the opportunity to direct his first major film titled ""Being John Malkovich"", written by Charlie Kaufman (""Eternal Sunshin of the Spotless Mind"", ""Adaptation"", ""Syndecdoche, New York"").

The film resonated strongly with younger viewers and also receive rave reviews from film critics, ""Being John Malkovich"" would win over 45 awards and receive over 45 nominations including Academy Award nominations for ""Best Director"", ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly For the Screen"" and ""Best Actress in a Supporting Role"" (Catherine Keener).

Championed for its originality, ""Being John Malkovich"" will now be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of the Criterion Collection in May 2012.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Being John Malkovich"" is presented in widescreen 1:85:1 and is a new digital transfer.  According to Spike Jonze, this Criterion Collection release ""matches what our original print looked like and how we were never able to get that when we put out the DVD before"".

With that being said, its important to note that if you want the best video and audio quality of ""Being John Malkovich"", it's recommended that one purchases the Blu-ray release.  Having owned the original DVD release of ""Being John Malkovich"", the quality of the film is definitely an upgrade for this Criterion Collection DVD.  There is a bit more clarity and detail but I'm confident that the Blu-ray version will probably feature even better detail and clarity.

As for the picture quality, according to the Criterion Collection, ""Being John Malkovich"" was supervised by director Spike Jone and cinematographer Lance Acord.  The new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on a DFT SCANITY film scanner from the original 35mm camera negative.  The datea was then color corrected on a DaVinci Resolve at Company 3, with colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small, dirt, grain, jitter, flicker and noise reduction.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1. Dialogue is crystal clear and I heard no hiss or any audio problems during my viewing.  While the film is primarily dialogue, there is good use of surround channels during the entry to John Malkovich's head.  Once again, for better audio quality, I recommend going for the Blu-ray version for even better audio clarity and dynamic range on its lossless audio track.  Otherwise, the DVD sounds very good..

According to the Criterion Collection, the 5.1 surround soundtrack was created from the original 6-track magnetic master.  Clicks, pops, etc. were removed using ProTools HD and then translated into foreign languages and redubbed to our original soundtrack master.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

English subtitles are presented in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Original and captivating, Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" was a film that no one would ever expect to be made into a film, but because of its originality, it has become one of the most groundbreaking films to be released in America within the last 15 years.

Back in May  2000, during my original DVD review of ""Being John Malkovich"", I often wrote about how original the film was and how Spike Jonze was going to be the next big director in the U.S. because of this film.  There was no doubt that ""Being John Malkovich"" was a film that would resonate strongly with independent filmmakers, younger audiences and the film critics, but watch the film again in 2012, you also realize how this film was ahead of its time.

In the beginning, ""Being John Malkovich"" had a banal style of a man who lives a life that is not going all that great, his love for puppeteering is not as welcomed in today's society nor is it a way for him to make a living and there is a sense of disconnection with his wife, who shows more love to her animals (which he could care less of).  And the main character, Craig Schwartz starts to have a sexual attraction to his co-worker.  Once again, seems banal but that's where things take a twist.

Who would ever think of a film where people can enter a tunnel and enter the mind of actor John Malkovich.  And those who experience it literally go through a life-changing experience.

On paper, the explanation of ""Being John Malkovich"" seems as if it is being penned by someone trippin' on acid, but what he have is a writer striving for originality and a young director at the time who was creative and did thing his way.

Charlie Kaufman is a writer who loves creating original stories and since ""Being John Malkovich"", he has continued this audacious style through films such as ""Synecdoche, New York"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Confessions of a dangerous Mind"" and ""Adaptation"".  And Spike Jonze is a director that knows how to interpret Kaufman's originality with his own.  Jonze is not a product of traditional Hollywood.  He has come from a music video background and is known for his fascinating and cool videos for The Beastie Boys, Bjork, R.E.M., The Chemical Brothers, Weezer and many others.

He is a product of a young, talented filmmakers that are known for creativity and he has shown that in his films such as ""Adaptation"", ""Where the Wild Things Are"" but creativity that also goes even farther when he and a group of friends created Dirt Magazine, he owns the Girl skateboard company and the collaboration between Jonez and Kaufman have been successful.

Back to ""Being John Malkovich"", part of the allure of the film is how people want to experience the life of a celebrity.  And they can see it up front.  It's an invasion of privacy but yet people revel in it.  I don't think Kaufman or Jonze would know how life would change for celebrities with social media, Facebook, Twitter and how information is so readily out there for outlets like TMZ.com and regular people to know what celebrities are thinking and where they are at, almost real time.

There are so many things that made me laugh while watching this film.  From the 7 1/2 floor where Craig works and seeing the ceilings so low, with a crazy orientation video, add in a woman who misunderstands everything that is being said, a crazy boss, a sexy (golddigging) co-worker and a puppeteer who seems normal but yet has some creepy qualities.

And that led to the unexpected nature of how this film was going to play out.  I remember watching this film and thinking of how original this film was but also how exciting it was because it didn't follow banal traditions or storytelling.  And watching it again over a decade later, ""Being John Malkovich"" is still a wonderful film!

John Cusack did a wonderful job of playing the creep Craig Schwarz and this is probably one of the few films starring Cameron Diaz (and Charlie Sheen) which I actually do like.  But both Catherine Keener and even John Malkovich himself were great in the film and how cool Malkovich was of the film's humor and the use of his persona.  For Keener, her appearance on ""Being John Malkovich"" would eventually lead the actress to appear in more films by Jonze and Kaufman and for Malkovich, if ""Dangerous Liasons"" or ""Con Air"" didn't make audiences know much about the actor, this film surely generated interest in him.

And it was also great to see Octavia Spencer in an earlier, shorter role a decade before she would win awards for her role on ""The Help"".

As for this new release from the Criterion Collection, eventually the new digital transfer is enticing since the film is on Blu-ray but for the DVD version which I am reviewing, the DVD looks and sounds good and as Jonz said, with the previous DVD's, he wasn't able to get the color to match to the original print, until now.  So, while the Blu-ray release is surely the definitive version to own, those who don't own a Blu-ray player and are fine with DVD, will still enjoy this release from the Criterion Collection.

For those who owned the older DVD, while the majority of the special features are on this new Criterion Collection release, one thing that is new is the conversation between John Malkovich and actor John Hodgman (better known to many as the PC guy in the older Apple Mac commercials).  This interview was much more informative and enjoyable to watch than the older ""An Interview with Spike Jonze""  which was not good at all.

But what it comes down to is the new digital transfer and the Criterion Collection giving it a 4K digital transfer is a big deal because this film looks great on DVD and magnificent on Blu-ray.

Overall, if you are a big fan of ""Being John Malkovich"" or a person who is curious about this film (or Criterion Collector who will buy the film no matter what), this film is a worthy addition to the Criterion Collection and is definitely recommended!",1337385600,,10446,4.897042093287827
1075018,1,630580706X,"This movie is just plain awful.  I've heard all the arguments saying that it's and ""adult fairy tale"" or that I ""just don't understand it,"" but that's not true.  This movie sucks out loud.

First, you have the main character putting on an erotic puppetshow on the street.  Then, he gets a job working on floor 7 1/2 of some office building.  Then he finds some weirdo tunnel that allows him to see through the eyes of John Malkovich.  If you can buy all of that, it gets worse.  Two other people learn about the tunnel.  John Cusack's character thinks that Cameron Diaz's character is spending too much time going into that tunnel (or some crap like that) and locks her in a dog kennel.  Then, the two women who know about the tunnel (one of them being Diaz) proceed to have this psycho-lesbianic relationship through John Malkovich by learning to control him!  It's stupid and it's trashy!  It's practically rape of John Malkovich because he has no control over this nasty relationship!

I can't believe anyone likes this movie.  If you actually enjoy this film, you probably need some extreme psychotherapy in order to determine just where you went wrong in your life.  Just stay away from crap like this.  Go watch something better, like ""John Carter"" or some crap like that.  Yes, that's right, even a movie that bombed at the box office is much better than this trash.",1336176000,4,1373,4.634854771784233

1075091,4,630580706X,"Alternating between quirky, drab, conceptual and surreal, this fantasy what-if doesn't even march to the beat of any drummer in the classical sense. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are unrecognizably pedestrian as a mismatched husband and wife at the end of their rope, both after the same thing in spite of one another. Their marriage, and the factors that lead to its quick, sad disintegration, may be the traditional center of the story, but along the way the plot jolts in so many wildly different directions that it's actually rendered secondary. Like a journey through the mind of a creative genius with serious ADD, it samples a dozen concepts strong enough to power their own film, then still finds a way to somehow marry them all into a single adventurous, mostly coherent, finale. Unclassifiable in the very best way, it's not something I could watch more than once every four or five years.",1329696000,,898,4.875816993464053
1075092,1,630580706X,"I am still terribly confused.  I wondered if this biography was even authorized, but John Malkovich was in it, so it must have been.  That makes me worry it was autobiographical, he seemed so lucid and sane in other movies.  Also, the building with a floor at half height, what building inspector signed off on that?  Talk about a fire hazard.  The thing could not have been structurally sound.  I am just glad no actors got hurt filming in that strange building.  There are a lot of good reviews though, so maybe I am missing something.",1318032000,16,537,4.53125
1075093,4,630580706X,There is nothing else to really say. I have never seen such a movie before. The truth is I had no idea what was going on.

Well this is a complete & thorough study of what that might be like and what could go wrong if that experience was available to pretty much anyone willing to pay a small price. This is actually a very interesting movie that came out in the very interesting year of 1999. It stars John Malkovich, John Cusack (one of the greatest hopeless romantics of all time, this guy never wins), Cameron Diaz, and Cathrine Keener all in arguably career defining roles. This film is a tour de force in strange and abstract film making. It is experimental cinema at its finest. The concept of entering the mind of John Malcovich is stretched in many different ways. The meaning behind Being John Malkovich could be interpreted exponentially. It is a success because it ultimately comes down to what is going on inside your head while you are watching this strange and bizarre gem.

1075096,3,630580706X,"Certainly Being John Malkovich's concept is incomparable to most, if not, all films. It explores the themes of identity--and lack thereof--in every day people, and their inner desires. While the film's concept is highly unique and novel, it isn't enough to make up for the direction the film takes after its initial surprise. The film's second half, in particular, steers away from its own creativity and into mediocrity, with unmemorable characters and a simplistically cynical plot. In the end, this is a film that is watchable at times, but also unappealing and unlikable.

It wasn't the nonsensical aspect of this film that put me off; it was the direction it takes after about thirty minutes or so. Clearly, there is inventiveness at the beginning. John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a puppeteer, aimless in life with an unfulfilling marriage and an inability to find a puppeteering job (imagine that). Taking a job at an office, he apparently has found a dimension into the mind of John Malkovich, a portal where a person can go and literally experience John Malkovich's life for fifteen minutes. He and his female coworker concoct a scheme to charge to go into the portal. Craig tells his wife, Lotte, also of this portal, and she experiences a strange euphoric feeling after going through once. John Malkovich gets wind of the portal, and goes to experience it. At times this film has some fun moments: the scene where John Malkovich goes into his ""own"" portal to see what it is like is rather amusing. He sees a line up of eagerly waiting customers. Craig's first entrance into the portal as John Malkovich is comical. However, rather than continuing on with the eccentric concept of ""being John Malkovich"", the film's takes a different direction, as the plot's second half veers off into pettiness, with the main characters, in particular Craig's wife, going into the portal with the purpose of fulfilling their sexual desires. Some call this original; I call it selling out.

I know that likable characters don't completely make a movie, but the fact that every character is basically unlikable doesn't help much, either.  John Cusack's character is so weak, and seeing him falling all over himself for some office worker gets old. One watches him and wonders what motivations he possibly has. Cameron Diaz' character is also self-centered, caring only for herself and her desires to be with the other female. The female coworker is also cold and grates on your nerves as the film progresses. The only redeeming character is probably John Malkovich himself, who is at least able to be a good sport about making himself the center of the joke.

I guess it is quirky and different, in a cold, spiritless kind of way. I'd have to say that this film is vastly overrated, and not one I'd want to watch again.",1275955200,16,2813,4.878661087866109
1075097,5,630580706X,I loved this film. It was great and strange. I loved the 7 1/2 floor and all the characters. It's interesting seeing the changes people have as they be john for 15 mintues.

So even though I'm still not sure of the point of the movie I find it very entertaining in a strange way because it just cracks me up and in today's times I need and appreciate a good laugh!!!",1262476800,3,482,3.83
1075099,5,630580706X,"While I have seen and enjoyed this film many times I figured with Where the Wild Things Are about to come out I'd give this film a re-look-see and write a proper review for it. BJM is on it's surface satirical take on modern famous types, unknown creative types, and what it is that makes those at both ends of the spectrum tick. Now while the true creative type from any discipline is compelled by unknown forces there are also those amongst them that are, shall we say, compelled by less pure forces. Those being fame and money. Still, even the pure artist needs recognition of some sort. After all, art is just another form of communication. Without anyone to communicate with an artist can go ever inwards and mad, I suspect, if one is not understood by others on some level. Craig Schwartz, is a pure artist who is at the start of the film misunderstood and not communicating, no matter how hard he tries, to those around him. As events unfold his wife leaves him and he is eventually thrust into the head of real life actor John Malkovich. This is where the film departs from what is typical in mainstream movies. Ambiguity, symbolism, and exploration of existential concepts is not what most people go to the films to enjoy decoding, thinking about, or passively watching.  Soon sexuality and the male and female body types we are born into are questioned and subsequently broken down. Also challenged is talent, fame and the notion that recognition comes from good art or just any established face in the public eye with some money to spend to explore any whim. Finally the film brings into question our very lives and if in fact we are in control of anything, or if some unseen force controls us. Craig Schwartz is a puppeteer who in fact winds up controlling John Malkovich and using his fame and money to further his personal self indulgent need to be a puppeteer is a never ending tunnel of mirrors like the very universe itself, where particles and matter are seemingly infinite outwards and inwards. This same topic is explored in other films written by Kaufman, Synecdoche, New York being the first that comes to mind with the never ending warehouses and smaller and smaller paintings.

In ending we see a new life born, unaware that it is controlled by hidden forces. Is this each and every one of our experiences? This is food for thought in BJM. The film never fully explains itself and that is why the film is so great. For if everything were explained and summed up then there would be no reason to re-watch the film again and agin, seeing it fresh each time it's explored down the road.

The inclusion of animals and higher primates in the film is symbolic. I suspect it alludes to our evolution, base animal nature and how we so often deny that we are in fact just another animal on this planet, albeit a creative one, apart but the same from all other creatures.

The 1/2 floor represents our subconscious, and also animal side. Much is explored and hashed out in the 1/2 floor of that building. things go in and things go out. Personalities and desires, thoughts, hopes, dreams. The characters want to go back to the portal that is in there. The portal to ones true self.

Comedy, a trait that most likely developed as a result of our higher brain functions, is explored as well. Comedy in this film is approached as absurdity. Existence is a bit absurd and this film takes it head on. Comedy probably developed as a buffer from the complex human brain running itself mad with endless thoughts about the nature of existence. These thoughts are explored and bubble up and out of the subconscious to the surface.

This film is a masterwork by the writer and director. It will be remembered long after the drivel of the day is long forgotten. This is one of the great films of our times.",1255564800,4,3808,4.57624633431085

1075228,5,630580706X,"Charlie Kaufman may be the greatest screenwriter of our generation.  He's written three of the greatest screenplays in recent memory (`Being John Malkovich', `Adaptation' and `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') and those are just the three I've seen (to be honest, I was not entirely impressed with `Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' and I never saw `Human Nature').  He has a knack for creating scenarios that are entirely improbable yet tap into the very soul of a human.  His films are not merely comedic entertainment but are important and philosophical in their relation to human nature and innate desire.

`Being John Malkovich' is not your typical comedy.

The film tells the story of puppeteer Craig Schwartz who is growing tired of not having an audience for his work.  After he is persuaded by his wife to get a job he finds that his new working environment is opening portals (quite literally) to an entirely new existence.  Hidden away in his very workroom is a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, the actor.  Yes, by crawling through a long cramped tunnel one can be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes before being spit out over the Jersey turnpike.  Craig, having fallen for his intriguing coworker Maxine, devises a plan with her to charge admission into the mind of Malkovich, but entering that portal changes their lives in many other ways.

There are so many ways to interpret this movie that I feel as if touching upon them all would be too difficult a task at this point.  I will admit that watching this film, and even more so just contemplating its meanings afterward, changed me in a way.

To be completely honest, I woke up wanting to be John Malkovich.

The film exposes some very human truths, in regards to the desire to be someone we're not and the desire to see ourselves through someone else's eyes.  It also, in a somewhat humorous way, exposes the worthlessness of celebrity in itself, the almost faux notion that making a name for ones self really makes a difference.  First we have Craig who just wants to practice his work, but he hasn't the name to do so.  In Malkovich he finds a way to expound upon his love of puppeteering.  Then you have his wife Lotte who is unsatisfied with her existence in finds in Malkovich something that feels right.  Then you have Maxine who desires to be desired, and while she is desired by many she is not desired for the right reasons, until she stares into Malkovich's eyes and sees Lotte starring back at her.

And then we have Malkovich.  What I thought was so great about the script was that it in a humorous and sub-plotted kind of way approached that fact that celebrity is not as glamorous as one expects.  Malkovich is regarded as a respected and loved actor yet no one that talks to him really knows what movies he has made or what roles have made him so `respected'.

""Who's John Malkovich?""

The films brilliant prose is bolstered by the fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC, performances by the entire cast.  John Cusack is awkward, goofy and tired, which masterfully captures his characters unhappiness with his lot in life.  Cameron Diaz is brilliantly sporadic with her actions and feelings, adding layers to her characters inborn struggle to be herself.  Catherine Keener is flawless as Maxine.  She demands our attention with her marvelous manipulation of our emotions.  We want her to get what she wants even if it destroys us.  This movie though, is called `Being John Malkovich', and honestly, it is John Malkovich himself that drives it all home.  His brilliant portrayal of himself is utterly flawless.  I have liked him in the past and found him stale in the past, but this performance is astonishing in every sense of the word; especially as it draws to a climax and he starts to unravel.

`Being John Malkovich' is funny, sure, but like Kaufman's other work, `Being John Malkovich' is so much more than a typical comedy.  It answers questions (or at least asks very many) about life, human interaction and the very root of who we are and who we want to be.

Lotte Schwartz: I'm sorry. I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his cage.

A puppeteer discovers a portal that leads literally into the head of the movie star, John Malkovich.

Craig Schwartz: Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.

Craig discovers that LesterCorp is on the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin Flemmer building by seeing a ""7 1/2"" on a building directory in the lobby - at the 7 1/2-minute point of the film.

Dr. Lester: Any questions?
Craig Schwartz: Just one. Why are these ceilings so low?
Dr. Lester: Low overhead, my boy - we pass the savings on to you! But seriously, that'll all be covered in the orientation.

The play that Craig was performing with his puppets (when he gets smacked by an angry parent) is based on the letters of Abelard and Heloise, written between 1115 and 1117 AD, which were found, copied and abridged by Johannes de Vepria, a 15th century Cistercian monk, into ""Ex Epistolis duorum amantium"" (""From the Letters of Two Lovers""). This became a classic document of early romantic (tragic) love used by many artists in their work including William Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet. In addition, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's later project Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) took its title, and no small amount of inspiration, from Alexander Pope's ""Eloisa to Abelard.""

Dr. Lester: I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech.

The 1990 Steppenwolf Theatre building in Chicago (Malkovich was one of the first members of Steppenwolf, and remains one today) includes a half-floor used for storage.

The original script has Kevin Bacon in place of 'Charlie Sheen' , as Malkovich's actor friend.

John Malkovich: Ma-Sheen!
Charlie Sheen: Malcatraz!

The play that John Malkovich is rehearsing on stage is Shakespeare's ""Richard III."" The lines ""Was ever a woman in this humour woo'd? / Was ever a woman in this humour won?"" are I.ii. 239-240, where Richard is gloating over his use of power, lies and crime to obtain the woman he desires, Lady Anne. This rehearsal scene is immediately followed by the first time that Craig makes love with Maxine via Malkovich.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maxine: Tell me a little about yourself.
Craig Schwartz: Well, I'm a puppeteer...
Maxine: [turns to bartender] Check!

Several characters in the movie remember Malkovich as having played a jewel thief, even though, as he correctly points out, he never did. However, Malkovich did eventually play a jewel thief in Johnny English (2003).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Craig Schwartz: You don't know how lucky you are being a monkey. Because consciousness is a terrible curse. I think. I feel. I suffer. And all I ask in return is the opportunity to do my work. And they won't allow it... because I raise issues.

1075320,4,630580706X,"The film is deeply funny because of the grossness of the concrete realization of the argument of the plot. It is muddy, dirty, crawling in a corridor, perverting in the most grotesque way Alice in Wonderland looking through the looking glass and sharing an apartment with an ill-mouthed parrot and a chimpanzee. The hole in the hedge is a rat hole in the wall and the only attractive thing in it is the glass doorknob. Then the plot is absolutely funny. It is based on one person being able to crawl inside another person and impose his or her personality onto that other person. That's strange but very fast it becomes ah ah because of the identity of the person inside and the identity of the person with whom the inhabited one is having relationships, discussions, rapports, even intercourse of course. In a way it is perverted since a woman can live her love for another woman by accepting her to be in the man that is the vessel of that intruder or invader. If the man is invaded by a woman and has a personal relationship with another woman, the two women are making love, to the point of procreating a girl, their daughter. That's definitely ah ah. Then the film deals with phantasms in the heads of Western men and women. Everyone wants to be able to make their desires and emotions towards anyone whatsoever real. But after all you have to keep some appearances, as a British TV series about a certain Mrs Bouquet used to say, and that's how the inhabited human vessel can enable so many possible connections to take place. Then it shows that success in our society does not depend on the value you have but on the value the public persona you are living in has. If you live in the body of a great person anything you will do will be successful and seen at once as great. Finally, and that's the punch scene at the end of the film, this possibility to transit from one person to another will enable some old people to get into younger bodies and live forever. The very fundamental myth of the Western world, but a myth they have never dared to realize in a religious belief or philosophical theory. The Buddhist did it but not the Christians, nor the Moslems, nor the Jews, the three Semitic religions. So Hollywood is playing the role of the provider of eternity to the few who will believe it because they have always dreamed of it. Blessed be the gullible, ... So all in all a funny film that makes you feel at times kind of ill at ease.

1075324,2,630580706X,"After viewing it for myself, I feel that most of the comments made about the movie are seriously misleading (The good reviews were the reason that I purchased the movie in the first place). There are some aspects of the movie that I consider well thought out and interesting, but the movie itself falls short of all the ""ingenious, original, modern masterpiece"" nonsense that is said about it. During the first half of the movie, my expectations were high that this was going to turn out to be an offbeat indie movie comparable to the works of Michel Gondry . . . . that is not the case at all.
The beginning of the movie, like I said before seemed promising. . . . the main character is an unemployed puppeteer who is truly gifted with creative genius in his art. Unfortunately for him, his line of work is a dying breed and because he is a nameless no one, he lives his life in obscurity, giving performances on street corners, which even there are not well received. Based on a suggestion by his wife (an eccentric sort herself, with numerous pets to compensate for lack thereof of children), he seeks employment. The only appealing job he finds remotely related to his line of work, is a job as a filing clerk, requiring someone with nimble hands. His new job is found on the 7 1/2 floor of an office building, where the ceilings are so low that workers have to hunch over in order to walk around it.

After dropping a file behind a cabinet, he accidental discovers a portal into the mind of John Malkovich. He crawls down it and finds that he can now see through the eyes of John, becoming him for 15 minutes. After which, he is flung out of the portal and is thrown into a ditch along the Jersey Turnpike. He and another coworker (a love interest for both him and his wife) quickly decide to use this discovery to make fast cash and market the portal as a sort of theme-park ride for individuals willing to pay out 200 dollars to go through the tunnel.

The plot takes a serious nosedive after this point. The remaining times that the main character or his wife go through the portal to be john Malkovich are basically for the sake of having sex with the main character's coworker in an out of body experience. . . which I thought was a disappointing turn in what could have been an otherwise very good movie. . . . Am I the only one that doesn't find it appealing to watch this kind of crap?

I don't understand how this can even remotely be considered a work of cinematic art. It uses sex, like so many other shallow movies, to cover up the empty space between the beginning and end of the movie to hold over the viewers interest and disguise a lack of substance in a poorly developed point in the plot.

The climax of the movie displays some of the same creative qualities that I found appealing in the introduction, but overall it just left me just hoping it would hurry up and end. . . . . . Needless to say I will not be watching this movie again anytime soon.",1187481600,14,2972,4.339928057553957

Let's face it, that was a stroke of genius - to throw together the tragic medieval lovers, Abelard and Heloise in the street show created by a talented puppeteer Craig Scwartzh (John Cusack) with the nimble fingers but out of work in ""today's wintry economic climate"", Elijah the Chimp with the mental problems that go back to his childhood, the surreal office that is located on the 7 1/2 store of a New York City office building and a floor is four feet high. Add Cameron Diaz (Craig's animals loving wife Lotte), completely unrecognizable, aging and balding Charlie Sheen, cynical and practical Maxine (Catherine Keener), who had an unique experience of having two people looked at her ""with complete lust and devotion, through the same pair of eyes"", and send them all to the wild ride inside the famous and respectable actor John Malkovich's brain to see what he sees and to feel what he feels, to the trip that would last 15 minutes and end up in a ditch on the side of New Jersey Turnpike. This is just the beginning...Oh, and what John Horatio Malkovich feels with all the travelers in his head and what he sees when he enters the portal to his own brain, you have to find out for yourself! What drug were Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze on?! Not even two hours long, the movie never ceases to surprise and entertain.

The idea is terrific---what it's like to spend 15 minutes being someone else---in this case a famous and succesful movie actor.  The choice of actor fits in with the general motif---John Malkovich---who is, I think most people would agree--a little off-center, himself.  They didn't chose Tom Cruise (now that would be interesting) or Robert Redford or Brad Pitt....but John Malkovich..??!

 It could have developed into something really illuminating.  (like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)  But it dropped the ball somewhere and ended up being just a mess. The idea of the old people needing Malkovich's body was grotesque...and then the idea of using the child's body was even worse.  (shades of Rosemary's Baby)

It's essentially a heartless movie...no one really cares about anyone besides himself, with the possible exception of the Cameron Diaz character who, at least, cares about her animals.  The John Cuzak character, our ""hero"" is likable at first, as the hapless puppeteer, but he doesn't lose a moment to go after the snazzy new lady at work (Catherine Keener).  No one grew, no one learned anything, and, at the end I really didn't care about any of them, least of all, John Malkovich.

If you're really impressed by the fact that this is unconventional, and a lot of reviewers here are....then you may love this.  Love?  A funny word for such a loveless story.

1075424,4,630580706X,"I have a theory: audiences are getting smarter. Whereas before a big Hollywood movie with a massive marketing push would've been all the rage, now people are starting to know better. They're realizing that a terrible movie's a terrible movie no matter how often we can see Julia Roberts deal with more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff Michael Bay can destroy. So when a movie comes along like Being John Malkovich, or Memento or even visually impressive like the Matrix, we stand up and take notice. Building a career largely from inventive music videos, first time director Spike Jonze comes out of the gate with probably the most unconventional comedy you'll see.

Craig, due to his puppeteering skills gets accepted at a company located, amusingly, on the 7 1/2 floor, complete with cramped ceilings. He also has a strong attraction to one of his co-workers, feisty Maxine (Catherine Keener). One day while working, he discovers a small day and going inside he finds out he can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for 15 minutes with an unceromonious dump on the New Jersey turnpike ditch.

Craig and Maxine get an idea: charge 200$ for people to experience being John Malkovich which is a novel idea until Lotte goes through and feels a deeper connection, especially around the idea of Maxine. Then we have a bizarre love square or star or something since Craig loves Maxine who loves Lotte but only when Lotte is inside John Malkovich...'s head. Try not to wrap your head around it since it's better explained in the movie and after awhile you don't even worry about stuff like vessels or portals, you just go with it.

Casting is of course important and no one seems wasted, even Diaz, who I normally can't stand. The real treat though is of course Malkovich since at times you almost can't tell if he's acting or if he's really that quirky. Then there's the comedy which is subtle to the first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like the 7 1/2 floor and the small ceilings but then the film shows you what happens when Malkovich steps through his own portal and it becomes not only a technical marvel but one of the flat-out funniest things I've seen lately. Only problem with the story is that at a certain point it shifts gears and the film almost speed walks to its climax rather than lurching forward, like it was shot in the foot.

Like the Amazon review says, I don't know if the film can warrant repeat viewings and you can get more out of it every time you see it but that first viewing is quite something.",1172793600,2,2785,4.724279835390947
1075507,3,630580706X,"I give this film:  3-1/2 stars.

I would have given this movie 4 or even 5 stars but I found the explanation given for the phenomena of entering & 'being' John Malkovich to be weak (Even for a fantasy story).  i.e.  I felt the primary explanation for this, given by Orson Bean's character, was a big let down.

On the plus side the film does have many funny and unusual elements.
For example:
  John Malkovich playing himself under such bizarre circumstances.
Charlie Sheen plays a wonderfully exaggerated version of himself.
Cameron Diaz made-up to look so dowdy (She plays a pet shop manager who keeps all her physically and emotionally damaged animals at home with her).
A master puppeteer who tries to present creepily morbid skits as 'kid shows'.
An office building with a strange and silly 7-1/2 floor (The building has crow-bar in the elevator so you can pry open the doors between the 7th and 8th floors).

1075508,5,630580706X,"Unlike probably most ""Being John Malkovich"" fans, I actually saw the later Kaufman-Jonze collaboration ""Adaptation"" first.  I thought, and think, that that movie is brilliant, but I was a little disappointed in ""Being John Malkovich"" the first time I saw it.  It was very good, yes, but I was hoping for a bit more, since most reviewers seem to think it as good or better than that later film.  Well, yesterday I got through watching ""Being John Malkovich"" for the third time, about 2 years after I first saw it, and it's grown on me quite a bit.  I still don't think it's quite as good as ""Adaptation"", but it's pretty close.

""Being John Malkovich"" is one of those movies that seems to take place in the real world, except that there are a bunch of odd details that aren't right.  Ex: Puppeteering is a major artform; everyone in the world is a total oddball; there's a building with a 7 1/2 floor which contains a portal into John  Malkovich's brain.  This movie is so massively yet still so unobtrusively weird that I'm sure it requires a very specific taste to fully get into it.  You definitely need a taste for the odd.

The story centers around Craig Schwartz, (John Cusack) a failed street-puppeteer who lives in depression with his strange but good-natured wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) and their 100 or so pets.  Lotte suggests that Craig get a job, a real job, and he does so, becoming a filing clerk at a small business on the 7 1/2 floor of a large office building. (The ceiling is all of 4 1/2 feet high, and they have to emergency-stop the elevator to get to the floor.)  Craig is immediately smitten with fellow 7 1/2 floor-dweller Maxine (Catherine Keener).  Maxine is a cruel and cold-hearted individual, but Craig can't help himself and continues to pursue her in spite of her utter contempt for him.  His efforts appear to be going nowhere until one day when he finds a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet.  He crawls in it to discover that this is a portal into John Malkovich's brain, where you watch what Malkovich sees for 15 minutes, after which you are dumped in a ditch by the road  And then things really get weird, as Craig uses this portal as a way to connect with Maxine, but Lotte and others get drawn in and Malkovich finds out what's going on and we learn of the real purpose of the portal and on and on.  I don't want to go on, cause the inexplicable, labyrinthine plot is much of the appeal of the film.  (Though it isn't just crazy for crazy's sake, and actually comes together well.)  Beyond this, Kaufman has tons of clever, intelligent dialogue to support the wacky plot.

This movie is damn hard to review, cause it's so strange, and yet much of the appeal and humor is character-driven.  The unbelievable, oddball characters are all interesting, usually funny and often endearing.  Cusack is our main character and sort of the straight man of the film.  Still, he's not quite normal-- He does, after all, want to be a famous puppeteer.  He's a typical ""tortured artist"" with a scruffy beard and a ponytail, but you can't help but like him.  He's just so hapless, and John Cusack always does the average man thing well.  Orson Bean is great as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss and a 125 year old lech.  (As Craig says, ""It's pretty funny once you get past how disgusting it is.)  Catherine Keener is fantastic as Maxine, one of the most black-hearted  characters I've ever seen.  Yeah, she doesn't physically hurt anyway, but her relentless verbal abuse is unbelievable, as she responds to anything Craig says to her with a vicious, personal barb.  Finally, John Malkovich is wonderful as himself (sort of), and he hits a great range of notes and isn't afraid to make himself look bad.  (No one with half a brain would think this really has anything to do with who Malkovich really is, but lotsa people don't have half a brain...)

Though ""Being John Malkovich"" is a comedy, it's a rather thoughtful and ultimately very sad one.  It touches on themes of isolation, the desire to be someone else and the ultimate absurdity and uncontrollability of human life.  This absurdity is encapsulated in the central conflict, in Craig's unrequited love for Maxine; there's no reason why he should love her, she is, as Craig himself says, evil, but he can't help himself;  Man is capable of reason, but emotion rules us and emotion only sporadically makes sense. (And applying reason to emotion never helps, not in my experience, anyway.)

Though I can't help but see Kaufman as the primary author of the film, Jonze deserves a ton of credit for bringing the vision to fruition.  Making a film this wacky seem real must be damn near impossible, but Jonze pulls it off with aplomb and spectacular technical proficiency.  The film moves from near conventional scenes to first-person perspective, to dream sequences and flat out surrealism.  Yet, for all the technique displayed in the film, it rarely seems extraneous.  Jonze doesn't seem to be showing off, the flash is all just necessary to navigate the inexplicable plot.  The score is also fantastic, truly beautiful and often-moving, and it allows for a lot of the emotional impact in the film, particularly in the brilliantly conceived and heartbreaking final scene.

Man, this review is no good, but you can't do justice to a movie this good and this odd in a review.  You'll just have to watch it.

Cusack takes a job as a file clerk at a company that exists on floor 7 1/2 of an office building. One day, behind a filing cabinet, he finds a small door. Behind it is a portal into John Malkovich's head. While you are there you see everything he sees and hear him speaking. You remain there for 15 minutes and are then dropped on the roadside of the New Jersey turnpike.

Cusack tells Catharine Keener, a woman he works with that he has fallen in love with, she decides they can make money by charging people $200 to take a turn in Malkovich's head. Diaz takes a turn and changes completely as a person. She suddenly believes she should be a man. Then Keener begins dating Malkovich and falls in love with Diaz, but only when she's inside of Malkovich, which drives Cusack mad.

The ideas in this movie are wildly imaginative and original. You will never see another film like it. There are some laugh-out-loud scenes and also some quiet humor. The performances are excellent, especially Malkovich who riffs easily on his own image. The film as a whole, however, didn't completely work for me. I was bored more than once, and for all the odd humor, it takes a slightly darker turn halfway through. Also, the motivations of Catharine Keener's character are never fully explained and there is no reason shown why Cusack should fall in love with her so quickly or at all for that matter. The plot also gets too convoluted as the movie goes on.

The one thing this film does right is cinematography. When you actually are John Malkovich, the camera work is brilliant, as well as the depth perception, sound, and lighting. Basically, what the film does is make a peice of crap LOOK really pretty. John Cusack and Catherine Keener had great performances, but John Malkovich and Cameron Diaz had mediocre performances at best. The film leaves you with nothing. You watch it and you go ""oh,"" there is no ""wow"" not ""OH MY!"" no ""I can't believe it."" You are left there completely apathetic and in utter disappointment.

1075514,5,630580706X,"If anything, I enjoy the audacity and manic creativity of this 1999 black comedy more now than when it was first released. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who sends up the creative block he experienced after writing the film's script in 2002's ""Adaptation"", plainly refuses to use any accepted cinematic convention to tell the wildly eccentric story of Craig Schwartz, a downtrodden puppeteer who has a must-be-seen-to-be-believed adventure. An uncompromising artiste who cannot find work within his craft, he decides to accept a job as a file clerk to please his frumpy, animal-loving wife, Lotte. Things immediately go awry when he sees his place of employment is on the dwarf-sized 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan office building. He becomes drawn to an ice-cold co-worker, an apparent femme fatale named Maxine, but the story really escalates into high gear when he discovers a secret passageway that turns out to be the consciousness of actor John Malkovich.

The plot convolutions only get weirder yet strangely more resonant as Craig and others get to experience ""being John Malkovich"", including the actor himself. What subsequently happens is constantly off-kilter, but Kaufman brings perceptive insight into all the major characters in ways that are completely unpredictable. The beauty is that repeated viewings only bring out plot nuances that were not as apparent the previous times. Director (and sometime actor) Spike Jonze is an inspired choice to lead the proceedings since he lends an almost verit-style to the film making the lunacy seem human-sized. Casting is pure gold with a bedraggled-looking John Cusack appropriately awestruck as Craig, a cast-against-type Cameron Diaz energized by her curiosity as Lotte and Catherine Keener sharply feline as Maxine. Orson Bean brings out all the eccentricities of Craig's oddly deranged boss, and no one is better cast than Malkovich as a wildly narcissistic version of himself, especially as the plot spins further into a Freudian fantasy of monstrous proportions.

This is wildly inventive filmmaking that may alienate several viewers, but it really should be embraced as the kind of bold experimentation that mainstream Hollywood rarely attempts. The 2002 DVD extras are also pure gold, including an interview with Jones conducted under mock-stress; a brief featurette, ""An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering,"" that spotlights the behind-the-scenes work performed by puppet master Phil Huber; and a short called ""Intimate Portrait of the Art of Background Driving"", which purportedly documents the experiences of extras driving cars in the New Jersey Turnpike scenes where all of the Malkovich travelers end up. Along with the original theatrical trailer and several TV promotional spots, there are also two played-straight videos, excerpts of which are shown in the film - one the ""7  Floor Orientation"" and the other the vaunted pseudo-documentary, ""American Arts and Culture Presents: John Horatio Malkovich, Dance of Despair and Disillusionment"".

1075515,4,630580706X,"""Being John Malkovich"" was one of the most critically acclaimed and original films of 1999. They've taken a premise that everyone has thought about (What would it be like to be someone else?) and spins it into What if you could be one of the greatest living actors? That's exactly what was done here and it wielded some slightly demented results. John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a loser puppeteer with nothing going for him. He has no job and lives with his pet-crazed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, who looks very different). Craig, in need of work, gets a job as a filing clerk at a building where his floor has a low overhead and everyone is forced to walk hunched over. There, Craig meets the woman of his dreams Maxine (Catherine Keener, who recieved an Oscar nominated for this role). Maxine, however, is a cold-hearted and mean person who doesn't care about Craig. After dropping a file behind a cabinet, Craig discovers a portal into the brain of John Malkovich. You can enter the portal and for five minutes see the world through the eyes of Malkovich. As Craig slowly learns how to stay inside Malkovich permanently, the story gets even more demented. The movie has a solid first act, but after Craig becomes Malkovich I thought it veered off course for a little bit. Malkovich (as himself) is great; The only thing he proves here is that he is one of the best actors of this generation. All the performances are strong, although I thought Diaz was better than Keener and probably deserved a nomination a little more. The film is a dark-comedy in the classic sense. It's comedic, with only a few jokes...But some of them are pretty funny. (A semi-running joke involves people telling Malkovich how much they loved him in the movie where he played a jewel thief. Malkovich has never played a jewel thief.) This was the debut film by Spike Jonze, who had previously found success directing music videos. Watching the brief interview featured on the DVD is very odd and kind of weird. Oscar winner Charlie Kaufman (Best Original Screenplay, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') penned the movie, so if you've seen the aforementioned film or Adaptation...You know what you're in for. Not for everybody, but definitely original.

1075516,3,630580706X,"Over the weekend I watched this movie. 10 mins into the movie and I was reminded of 'I heart Huckabees' and somewhat of 'Garden State'. Abstract, Comic in a different way, not in ur face kinda humour and quite insightful too content wise and full marks to the fresh treatment of the film as a whole. No rules here for a typical mainstream cinema.

Craig Schwartz (John Cusak) has such an unusual career of a struggling puppeteer. He getting a job as a filer based on his fast fingers skill in an office, which is on a 7-1/2 floor and everyone inside that office, walks with a crouch (no option there) and all this in the name of 'lower heads'. Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) is an overly-animal friendly (is visible in her appearance too) person and they've quite a few different kinds of animals in their house who freely move about in their bedrooms, kitchen, watch tv together etc. Craig's colleague (Catherine Keener) is a sassy woman with prevalent opportunist traits and John Malkovich playing himself.

All of the above is on surface, a little deeper and all its quirkiness starts making sense.  The puppeteer theme had to do with manipulation, both with puppets and with real people. Everyone was manipulated in this film, and different people pulled the strings at different times. It also had to do with what it means to be a celebrity and about their real `identity'. Also tackles the hidden desires, be it sex or be it wanting to be someone else. Never satisfied with what we are and what we get is right described when Craig says, ""Consciousness is a terrible curse - I think; I feel; I suffer.""

There is no great start and end here or for that matter middle too, but it does have a strong central point to make and once you see through this point with an open mind, then it's a smooth enjoyable ride!

The director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman (Oscar for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) both bring a certain quirkiness to the table by their past work and when combined can only give more quirky results. After this they worked together for Adaptation and currently working on Synecdoche, New York (future release).

It's straight out of Dilbert.  The weird things Craig finds there seem to me to point up the bizarre things we do in our real offices every day.  (I work in a windowless office myself, where hardly a day goes by without management coming up with some new way of making my job harder.)  The movie only gets stranger from there.  For no apparent reason, Craig falls in love with his heartless co-worker Maxine, a woman whose most striking trait is a willingness to do anything for money. Craig's wife Lotte falls for Maxine as well, and they carry on a love affair by taking trips through the head of John Malkovich.  All the characters in the film are completely off their rockers. The send-up of our society's obsession with celebrities is hilarious.

The fact is, in the U.S. today we are living in a society that has gone completely bonkers.  The standard of living in America has declined an amazing amount in the last few decades, yet we still hear lots of rosy figures about economic growth.  We line up to apply for 30 years of debt slavery in exchange for a suburban Colonial with a two-car garage, then drive an hour and a half each way to get there every day.  We sell off our planetary birthright for a cheap toaster from Wal-mart.  Our politicians fall over each other to spend money the country doesn't have for a war we don't need.  Even after New Orleans, people seem to believe that global warming isn't a big deal.  The fact is, the party that cheap oil brought us is coming to an end.  If you think life in the U.S. is crazy now, wait and see what it will be like in ten years when the population has grown by another few million and the resources are running out.

So, yes: if you often use the phrase ""weird"" to describe people, films, music, etc., this might not be your bag.

Craig Swartz (Cusack) is a talented but unappreciated puppeteer who is forced to take a job filing in an office. He soon makes two discoveries that become intertwined: that he is smitten with the brassy and cruel Maxine, who works his building; and that, hidden behind a file cabinet, his office contains a portal into in the mind of actor John Malkovich. Those who enter the portal see and feel everything John does for 15 minutes, before being ejected onto the Jersey Turnpike. Maxine decides that she and Craig should exploit the portal, charging $200 per ""ride."" Meanwhile, Craig's wife (Diaz) gets addicted to the portal, decides she is a trans-sexual, and also falls in love with Maxine.

Yes, it sounds crazy, and it is; but the script and the director manage to make it work. The film is funny both in the traditional sense, with clever dialogue and semi-normal situations; but hilarious in the I-can't-believe-these-guys-thought-of-this sense.

1075571,4,630580706X,"It would be easy to analyze this film as a puppet show within a puppet show, as a puppeteer ultimately caught in his own strings, and so on, but none of that gets at what is most striking about it.  The film creates a world with its own logic, to which it stays true enough.  The characters act as we would expect them to, once we know who they really are.  What stands out in the film is the masterly, fresh comedy, from hilarious quirks to perfect deadpan send-ups of artistic and other high pretensions.  (And there's some excellent puppet work that the film doesn't invite us to fully appreciate.)  But all of that will be undermined for some by the emotional ambiguity of the film.

It begins the way many quirky comedies do, with what appears to be a basically decent person with sensibilities normal enough that we can identify with them, surrounded by other characters who are more cartoonish and off-kilter.  The contrast and tension between the normal and strange heightens the comic effect.  We are drawn in a little, enough to sympathize, but by the end of the film no character has developed into anyone we really care much about, and to the extent we do still care, our sentiments are rewarded with what ought to be chilling results, though they're played more for their dark humor.  No one turns out to have the capacity for any but the most superficial human warmth and love, obsession and casual sex taking their place.  Arguably the adults in the film deserve their fates, or, in the case of Malkovich, deserve only limited sympathy.

But what of the fate of the young girl at the end, whose psyche is already violated?  Well, either we can laugh it off and treat the film as a superficial comedy in which such things shouldn't be dwelt on, or we can identify with her as real and feel bad for her, in which frame of mind this becomes a more disturbing film all around than is generally acknowledged.

This sour note isn't so much the fatal flaw of this film as it is the clearest indication of it.  The emotional balance of the film is unsettled.  At times we seem to be dealing with people like us, with whom we should identify; at other times we see them as lacking real souls.  This may be regarded as part of the conceit of the film, that the rules of this alternate universe include that humans aren't fully human, or are only ambiguously so (which, of course, can be seen in context of the puppet theme).  That makes the film consistent in its way, but it's an ambiguity that leaves us unable to fully respond to the characters and what happens to them.  Comedy mistreats its characters, but if we're induced to care about them at first, it's more than comedy when they're truly hurt, or when we no longer care if they're hurt.

That will bother some people more than others, and, judging from the reviews, most people not at all.  If you like Fargo and Rushmore, you'll probably love this.  Just don't get too attached to the characters or anything else that seems genuine at first if you want to enjoy it as comedy.  And if you want to see it as tragic and disturbing, the overall comic approach may be more bothersome than helpful.",1138233600,,3159,4.495621716287215

It reminds us where film can take us, and is arguably the best example of creative screenwriting in the last decade or so.

The film is about a puppeteer named Craig Schwartz (John Cusak) who, upon taking a new job filing for a small company, discovers a hidden door in his office, which leads to a long and narrow tunnel.  Crawling through the tunnel himself, he finds that the door is actually a portal in to the mind of actor John Malkovich: whoever goes through the portal spends fifteen minutes living the life of Malkovich through Malkovich's eyes.  A bizarre idea already, but the fun begins when Craig and his co-worker, Maxine, (Catherine Keener) decide to sell trips through the portal after work hours in their office are over.  Like a Malkovich theme-park ride.

  Without giving away any more, I will say that the film features great performances all around, but sticks out because Cusak and Cameron Diaz play characters so different than what they are typically cast as.

When he, having gone through and, literally, out of his own mind, cries out ""I have seen things no man should ever see"" this is, of course, a joke. Well noted, JSG. But, as you also know, he happens to be right, and the end of the movie is anything but funny, not even in the gallows humor sort of sense. The scene where Maxine thinks of making Malcovich, in whose body she is in, eat omelette off the table, is another little memory anchor. The film makes me think of rain; I do believe there are rainy scenes there, or this might be a false memory, but at any rate the grey palette and the music  remind me of a dounpour, cold, steely, never stopping, pouring down on some very miserable and confused human beings...

To those who have not seen it: by no means think this is a negative review in the habitual sense. I gave the picture 4 stars not because of this hidden theme but only for petering out somewhat in the second portion. Do, in fact, buy or rent it. You'll be glad you did, even if, in the end, you find yourself uncertain about the genre. It is, perhaps, better to be much delighted and a bit heavy-hearted than just amused; the displeasure is often a sign you have learned something uncomfortable and new.

1075658,5,630580706X,"Stop laughing and step back a minute---""Being John Malkovich"" isn't funny, it's a horror movie. Alright---it's funny, *and* it's a horror movie.

Somewhere, somehow, sometime, someplace (possibly Providence, Rhode Island) Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft got together. Genes were spliced. The warped and twisted biological result was Spike Jonze, one of modern cinema's most insidious, surreptious, diabolically gifted and wickedly talented filmmakers and the most Terrible of the Enfants Terribles stalking the American academy of Arts and Letters today.

Having helmed the infamous Beastie Boys ""Sabotage"" video, Jonze and partner-in-crime Charlie Kaufman were ready to cobble together a Trojan Horse and aim it at the dark heart of Fortress Hollywood.

They succeeded massively with the darkly subversive ""Being John Malkovich"", the story of a disaffected puppeteer (played by John Cusack) who discovers a secret aperture into the mind of actor John Malkovich.

Some wrong-headedly think this is a surreal comedy. Poor, naive, childish innocents, I say! I'm here to contend that for all its comedic trappings, ""Being John Malkovich"" is a horror movie that H.P. Lovecraft himself would appreciate.

Yes, I know, the title itself is risible, the notion of a portal into John Malkovich's consciousness makes one giddy, and you can't possibly have a proper cosmos-ripping horror movie with Cameron Diaz, John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Charlie Sheen. I know all the standard objections.

But first: if you haven't seen ""Being John Malkovich"", stop reading this silly review and go buy the thing. You'll be utterly delighted and glad you listened to my advice.

Alright, for those of you who have seen this wicked little gem of sheer cinematic subversion---listen up: ""Being John Malkovich"" is a horror movie, not a comedy, a long-toothed snarling wolf dolled up in comedic sheep's clothing. Think not? Fine: let's leave the idea of John Malkovich having his body snatched out of it. If the idea of a blameless, innocent, blithe little girl being invaded by a small platoon of slobbering geriatrics isn't horror, then nothing is horrible.

Still skeptical? That's fine, but be warned: everything in in Jonze and Kaufman's little tour de force here is expertly stage-managed and distilled to a single purpose, and that is fooling the innocent, naive viewer to the movie's singularly malign purpose: body-snatching is front and center here. If you think this is a comedy, dear friend, then you're being duped with fine food and good wine, just the tools the wicked immortal Dr. Lester (a fine turn by the great Orson Bean, with nods to Lovecraft's ""Terrible Old Man"") used, as the evil Captain Merten had used before him.

Think about it this way: what happened to Malkovich once Craig and Maxine's little entrepreneurial scheme took on a life of its own? Still feel like a good horse laugh? I'm thinking a stiff Scotch is more in order.

The direction and cinematography here are spot on, and every scene tells. The acting is also superb, from Cusack's dangerously desperate puppeteer, to veteran actors Bean and the late Byrne Piven (Captain Merten, who pities dwarves), to Catherine Keener, who plays the wicked, devious, Machiavellian shrew Maxine. I despised her every second she was on screen---good job, Miss Keener!

The real plaudits go to Cameron Diaz. I had never really considered Diaz an actress of substance, but her wildly schizophrenic romp as the crazed animal-lover Lotte showed the woman has some finely honed acting chops. Charlie Sheen sinks his fangs into his tiny but tasty role, and Malkovich purrs through the movie like a kitten.

Surreal, quirky, brilliantly paced, constantly resourceful, occasionally creepy, with a haunting, pining score by Carter Burwell and Bjork that calls to mind Philip Glass's composition for ""Mishimia"", ""Being John Malkovich"" is a clever, wicked, blackly funny work of genius, but it is very much a horror film. Having returned from a jaunt through his own tortured subconscious, Malkovich roars ""I have seen things no man should have to see."" Truer words couldn't have frothed from the lips of one of Lovecraft's tentacle-tormented heroes.

Still not convinced? Look at ""Malkovich's"" ample horror trappings: a skewed, twisted crawlspace of an office, forcing its denizens to walk in a crouch and situated between the floors of the building; a Terrible Old Man, confounded by an illusory speech impediment, who has chronicled the life of his unwitting host in a back-room; Dwarf Love;---and of course, bodysnatching.

To say nothing of this prospect: imagine the sensation of a horde of hungry, greedy, ancient eyes crawling across your body, a mulifaceted invasion force perched just behind the two innocuous irises of your dinner-mate.

Does that give you the giggles? It gives me the crawls.

Still laughing?

1075659,5,630580706X,"The amazing introduction in which we watch two puppets conducted by versatile hands works out into perfection because the best is yet to come.

This is one of those few films you love from the first five minutes running time. This a genial cross between Terry Gilliam, Luis Buuel and Woody Allen. Surreal and irreverent; caustic and astonishing; unexpected and provocative.

In the seven and a half floor of a building ( a hidden homage to the desperation and troubles of Marcello in 8  perhaps?), the people is obligated to walk like a hunchback and this several deviation leads to unexplored realities. This bizarre office encloses a secret; a portal - an illegal but unexpected device - who lands in the intimate territory of John Malkovich 's mind. During fifteen minutes. Interesting cipher: Do you remember my kind reader about the famous fifteen glory minutes of every human being must live according Andy Warhol?

Three different attitudes will turn around that surprising discovery : admiration in first instance and then a clever vehicle to get his unstoppable desire by John Cussack, a gold mine to make easy money by his job partner and the unexpected reaction of his beloved wife who discovers - a Woody Allen typical lure - behind her exaggerated devotion for the animals (their home is almost a zoo) the true sexual vocation.

As  you may expect the existential anguish, delirious obsession, greed and the cruel torture that means for Malkovich when he feels invaded his intimacy for outer Peeping Toms will make o you to break the logic links and enjoy and plunge in those weird but not least funny and hyper original script.

Two previous movies come to my mind that may be close in this sense: All of me and Zelig, both films deconstruct the ego and rebuild them, but demanding its prize (nothing is free).

John Cussack is terrific in his role. He is nowadays, one of the most versatile and talented actors of the American Cinema. Cameron Daz is brilliant as the neurotic wife and finally a sincere ovation for the artistic direction.",1127520000,,2053,4.829059829059829

Craig... something or another works in a cramped (to say the least) office between the 7th and 8th floor of a big corporate office building. He is a puppeteer at heart, but to make ends meet he takes this job, and loves it! He works as a filing clerk, but two factors heighten the working experience. He is smitten with his co-worker (Katherine Keener), and he discovers a trap door that leads him into the mind of celebrity John Malkovich (John Malkovich)! Holy Wow!
But what does a door into the brain of John Malkovich mean? Does Malkovich know? Is it a hallucination? Is it something else? Believe me, I really want to blurt it out, but I won't. See this movie, it's great.",1123891200,3,950,4.52906976744186
1075662,5,630580706X,"Being John Malkovich explores true human despair. It doesn't waste time criticizing commercialism or politics solely because they exist. It doesn't pile the blame of a man's misery on education of bad parenting. It understands that misery is part of human nature. People are gifted and burdened with consciousness, as Craig Swartz confides in his wife's pet chimp. Despair doesn't stem from society or any social institution, but from the mind of the individual. I see someone else laugh, I think, ""Why aren't I that happy?"" Someone else has money, ""How come I'm not rich?""

Human nature is to look toward the future to something grander than we can really achieve. People are dreamers. We can't be happy with ourselves so we strive to be someone else.

Being John Malcovich explores this dilemma with hilarity, grace, and intelligence. I provides miserable people the possibility to be someone else, if only for a short while. But the cost is great.

To truly become someone elseone has to give up who he is, and no matter how burdensome consciousness is, we value it more than anything. Plus it's a $200 service charge.

This combination of the practical and the metaphysical sets Malkovich apart from other Theater of the Absurd works, placing it among the greatest films of all time. It's a true masterpiece of not only the human condition, but of human behavior.

When a husband and wife fall for the same woman, they engage in horrific conflict. Not because the other has been unfaithful, but because the other is a threat to the extramarital relationship. Maxine is the perfect seductress to bring out this situation not because she has the erotic charm of the femme fatale, but because she's attractive and enjoys it. Despite her beauty, she remains down to Earth. She might mislead, but she is never entirely dishonest.

John Malkovich gives the greatest performance of his carreer as a man fighting for his very soul. You might be thinking, ""Big deal, he's playing himself."" Wrong! Not only is his character a fictional charicature held in the public's mind, he also plays Craig and Lester. And he captures them perfectly. Name me one other actor who can shout, ""Shut up!!!You overrated sack of sh*t,"" at himself and pull it off with grace and realism. Thought not.",1122508800,3,2275,4.880829015544041
1075663,5,630580706X,"Watching a film written by Charlie Kaufman is to understand what it's like to be a cinephile.  I mean, for somebody to dedicate so much of their life to the observation of others (if only for a couple of hours), there has to be a certain sense of self loathing, a desire to be somebody else, to get outside one's own head.  I certainly know that this is the case with me, and probably the reason why I've spent more time watching, reading, writing and now making films about the lives of others, rather than just living my own.

But what happens when life and art begin to merge, so much so that they become indecipherable from one another?  That's the subject of the first film collaboration between Kaufman and director Spike Jonze (whose real name is Adam Spiegel).  If you haven't seen the movie yet, this all must sound terribly pretentious.  Trust me, it isn't.  It's actually a hilarious film, and one that's not nearly as ""arty"" as it's reputation would have you believe.

The protagonist of the movie is Craig Schwartz (John Cusack in his best performance to date), thou I use the term protagonist very loosely.  He's actually quite creepy, in the mold of a Rupert Pubkin, but seems oblivious of this fact, which is what makes him such a tragic figure in the end.  Struggling to secure work as a puppeteer, he eventually relents to his wife's gentle suggestion that he look for work outside the field of puppetry.  In one particularly funny scene, he goes to her for comfort after being slugged by a man who took offense at his sexual suggestive puppet show (a forerunner to Team America: World Police), and she says to him, ""Oh, Craig.  Not again.""  Anybody who's ever experience professional rejection will immediately understand where his character is coming from.

Eventually, he settles on a job as a filing clerk and develops a crush on his verbally abusive co-worker, Maxine.  And though she shows little or no interest in him and is hardly the cultural beauty you'd expect to find in such a role, we understand his attraction immediately.  Much of this can be attributed to Catherine Keener, who emotes such a casual coolness that it becomes difficult to separate her from the character, a fact which has dogged her to this day (at least in my mind).  In fact, she's so desirable that even Craig's sexually-confused wife, Lotte, joins in on the Maxine obsession.  This after Craig shows her a portal into the mind of John Malkovich.  The two begin to date, but only when Lotte's inside the Malkovich vessel.  Craig, watching his wife carry on an illicit affair with the object of his affection, stews, and after a couple of encounters, which last only fifteen minutes (an obvious homage to Andy Warhols' theory on fame), he intercedes, tying up his wife and taking her place inside Malkovich's head.

Got it?  No?  Good.  Now you'll just have to see the movie.  Because trust me, there's no review that could do proper justice to the genius that is Being John Malkovich.  It's a film that reflects our ever-growing fascination with celebrity, even one as arbitrary as Malkovich himself.  That's not to say he isn't a fascinating character, he is, just that he's one I have a hard time imagining the readers of People magazine or Us Weekly identifying with.  Or as Bob Shaye, the head of New Line Cinema, put it, ""Being John Malkovich?  Why can't it be Tom Cruise?""  But to those of us living in the fly-over states, out of the glare of New York and L.A., we understand that it doesn't really matter, we'll attach ourselves to any celebrity, no matter how small.  This is a point proven by the fact that my local newspaper recently ran a cover story on a former resident (who lived two counties over, no less!) simply because he had a brief cameo in the recent Michael Bay picture, The Island.  For better or worse, this is what our country has become, and this film is a near-flawess comment on that.",1122422400,3,3917,4.6400580551523944

In our tabloid-soaked culture where we want our celebs dished out to us for our feasting, we now take our worship a step further: live inside and takeover a celebrity; get inside his brain and try to render our sense of being invisible by being John Malkovich.

Great idea but how does the film work in terms of pacing, plotline, and coherence? Amazingly, the narrative is tight and follows easily enough. The satire is always two steps ahead of us. There are too many laugh-outloud surprises in here to mention. But beneath the satire is a brooding, tormented meditation on a society that, without the razzle-dazzle of celebrity, is overcome by a sense of worthlessness and ennui.",1118016000,,993,4.807017543859649
1075665,4,630580706X,"I love surrealism so I liked this movie.  It's freaky, it's wierd, people don't look like themselves and there are unexplained pieces all over it.  Puzzling bits.  Unanswered pieces. Even the puppets add weirdness.

Craig (Cusack) is a brilliant, unrecognised puppeteer, who lives with his animal collecting wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  I have to say right off that her hair was *hideous* and gave her character a waif-like incompetent look.  She urges Craig to get a job after he gets hit by an offended dad while he's performing on the street in front of her shop.  He goes to work as a file clerk, inexplicably in offices that take up only 1/2 floor, populated by  employees who are just, well, odd- some are lechers, some think the whole world has a speech impediment and others are just wierd.

Craig discovers a ""tunnel"" and follows it into John Malkovich's brain and he and his freaky co-worker Maxine (Keener) decide this provides a fantastic opportunity to make extra cash.  Like the good puppeteer he is, he needs to go further than just visiting Malkovich.  Lotte, OTOH, finds the experience overpowering and overwhelming, with some interesting side effects in her relationship with the freaky Maxine.

I was uncomfortable with the scenes when Craig put Lotte in the cage- other people who are appalled by domestic violence will find that unamusing as well.  Of course, people appalled by same sex couples will have issues with the evolution of Maxine and Lotte's relationship.

As and actor, John Malkovich has always fascinated me.  Some other reviewers- who didn't like the movie- wondered why he would ""lower"" himself to the level of this movie.  I, OTOH, would see it as a wonderful opportunity.  How many actors get the opportunity to play themselves, yet, not really themselves?  To be in a scene where every single character is *themself*?  eeek!  Hard to imagine what that would be like!

The whole entering-through-the-portal-and-living-forever aspect was left largely unexplored- or unexplained.  We, the mere viewers, will just have to wonder about all those people who went into the tube and congregated together- for how long?  and how many people were in each of *them*?  *shudder*

The puppetry is amazing.  Anyone interested in puppets needs to see this movie- they need to *buy* it to support the art of puppetry.

1075755,5,630580706X,"Being John Malkovich is one of the most thematically ambitious films of the 1990's. It delves figuratively and literally into the weaknesses and complexities of the human psyche through the self-revealing and often comical actions of the main characters. Through bizarre situations, a subtle but emotional soundtrack, and a tiny portal on the 7 1/2 floor of an office building, Malkovich investigates the multi-faceted aspects of human beings, and the troubles they face in trying to find themselves.

Each character in this film is aware, sometimes painfully aware, of his or her identity, and the extremes that they reach in trying to change, control, and manipulate their identities suggest that consciousness is perhaps more trouble than it's worth. Craig Schwartz, played by John Cusack, is a talented puppeteer, and therefore a master at adopting multiple personalities, but until he finds a real person to imitate, he remains in his workshop, alone and unsatisfied with his life. That is, until he meets the magnetic Maxine, who's confidence and boldness enchants Craig for the entirety of the movie.

It seems logical to assume that if Craig is unhappy with his identity, then he could be happier if he wasn't aware of himself at all. As Craig says, ""Consciousness is a terrible curse - I think; I feel; I suffer."" Once Craig discovers the Malkovich portal in his office, people start lining up, literally, to partake in the life-altering experience; everyone, that is, except Maxine. Not once does she reveal the slightest interest in going through the portal. Maxine is comfortable in her own skin - a quality which Craig, and pretty much everyone who meets her, greatly admires - but it is not a comfort that comes from being ignorant of her own identity. Maxine is very aware of the power of self-assurance, a power which she uses to influence Craig, his wife Lotte, and Malkovich himself. While Craig proves that consciousness coupled with insecurity result in depression and desperation, Maxine exists at the opposite end of the spectrum, mixing consciousness with greed, and resulting in manipulation and callousness.

John Malkovich further reinforces the idea the consciousness kills; that ""ignorance is bliss."" Before he discovers Maxine's true intentions, he is blissful and carefree, with a strong acting career and a hot new girlfriend. But once he finds out, he becomes paranoid, frantic, and untrusting. When he consults his friend Charlie Sheen for advice, Charlie says, perhaps more revealingly than intended, ""The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy."" Indeed, it is Malkovich's conscience that steals his happiness.

If you've ever wanted to be someone else, or at least wondered what it would be like, then Being John Malkovich is a must see. A wry comedy that makes you think; an intellectual adventure that makes you laugh -- Being John Malkovich is a non-oppressive, insightful, and captivating glance into the deepest of human desires and insecurities.",1102550400,19,2980,5.176348547717843

Kaufman's written some TV screenplay but this is his first major one. He is the genius behind not only Being John Malkovich but also two other brilliant and twisted mind-benders: Adaptation (second Oscar nod) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (a hopeful win). These three films would rank of being the most original comedies ever made. Being John Malkovich is an ingenious dark comedy about three oddball characters who discover a hidden portal which sucks you into the mind of John Malkovich (played by himself). After your 10 minutes of being stuck inside his mind, you're automatically sucked out and dumped near the New Jersey turnpike. Wow! Bizare, huh?

John Cusack plays Craig, a frusterated and very talented puppeteer in New York who lives in a tiny apartment that's crowded by a bunch of numerous animals (Apes, dogs, birds etc), courtesy from his weirdo, animal-loving  wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, nearly unrecognizable with that frizzy head of hair. She's never looked this bad). Craig soon finds a job as a filing clerk in a large building in Manhattan in floor 7 1/2 (Yes, literally 7 1/2), which seems to be quite a hassle when using the elevator to get in and walking in a position that would have scoliosis examiners wanting to schedule appointments with these employees. Craig's meets and falls unrequitedly for co-worker Maxine (Oscar nominated Catherine Keener), a sardonic and cold-hearted woman which leaves you with the question of asking; Why would anyone have lovey feeling for such a cold-fish woman? Another question pops in mind too; Why would any woman return the favor of loving Craig back (Since he's such a boring loser-dork)? She wants nothing to do with him but she teases him occassionally. After Craig soon discovers the portal to John Malkovich, he tells Lotte and Maxine.

It increasingly becomes an obsession for these characters and everything escalates from bad to worse. Craig becomes increasingly psychotic and obsessed with Maxine, Lotte and Maxine have a lesbian relationship (But only when Maxine is in Malkovich's mind), Maxine soon ends up having affairs with Malkovih every now and then, New York residents end up knowing of the portal which is a $200 dollar fee that Craig and Maxine decide to advertise, Malkovich soon begins to realize that something is wrong, etc. I can't possibly go any further since I'd be giving too much away.

Being John Malkovich is not for everyone since many viewers will find it frusterating and and it's not a real laugh-out-loud kind of comedy.

Reasons not to see this movie: I assume this is the kind of film where you love it or you hate it. It's definitely out there and if the idea of being able to go into John Malkovich's head and getting spit out onto the New Jersey Turnpike is too much for you, you won't be able to enjoy it.

Overall: Fantastically original, fantastically acted...in a word, fantastic.",1095033600,,818,4.557823129251701

****spoilers herein****

john malkovich is totally mindblowing, when he plays craig schwartz, you see john cusack and not malkovich. truly brilliant. catherine keener has the most attractive role and she does full justice, cameron diaz in a deglamorized role shines.

apart from the acting, the quirky movie is radiant with brilliant humor that makes one laugh out loud. the weirdness of the situations get more and more complex and are very well handled by the director spike jonze. this movie has a terry gilliam feel to it, without going totally overboard. the plot gets quite absurd, but honestly, i didn't care. it was a fun movie. weird, yes, but wonderful",1093910400,,927,5.208053691275167

1075762,5,630580706X,"Charlie Kaufman has the distinction of writing the two most deranged screenplays I know of with ""Adaptation"" and it's predecessor, ""Being John Malkovich"". Here it became clear that a mind of unsurpassed creativeness had been loosed among the movie-making crowd.

Four fantastic performances are given by John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and Malkovich himself, and they are guided by Spike Jonze' direction and Mr. Kaufman's screenplay.

Cusack is a gifted, tortured, starving artist, and not just any artist, but a puppeteer - working with marionettes.  The film opens with a marionette performance so poignant it seems nearly human - the performance reminds me of the opening of ""White Nights"" in which Baryshnikov dances ""Le Jeune Homme Et La Mort"".  In White Nights it takes a moment before you recognize that you are watching a performance of a ballet, and in this film the marionette is so life-like it doesn't require much suspension of disbelief to think the puppet alive.  In another similarity between the two films later on a human-sized marionette is made to ""dance"" the lead role in ""Swan Lake"" surrounded by human ballerinas.  The rest of this film is SO startlingly original that it's easy to overlook the fact that the movie has some REALLY skilled puppeteering in it.

But I digress.  Puppeteering doesn't pay Cusack well, so there are money arguments between John and wife Cameron Diaz, who looks like a cross between a street person and a washer-woman here.  She works in a pet store and keeps a collection of animals including a dog, ferret, bird and chimpanzee - all apparently with some form of veterinary post-traumatic stress disorder.  Diaz' Lotte is the kind of person who forms close emotional ties with animals but has more difficulty being intimate with other humans.

Desperate for a paying job, Cusack thinks his nimble puppeteering fingers make him ideal for a company that specializes in filing, so he gets a job in an old New York building on the 7 1/2th floor - the kind of quirky little thing added in just for ""flavor"" in this film.

At his new job Cusack discovers Maxine - an attractive but sarcastic New York woman who has had it with most men, and Cusack's Craig Schwartz certainly seems like most men to her.

Craig also discovers something he wasn't expecting behind a filing cabinet: a portal that leads to 15 minutes inside the head of John Malkovich before dumping you on the side of a New Jersey highway.

If it seems like I've given away the whole story - I haven't.  These are all plot setups that lead to the development of a narrative that doesn't just have a ""twist"".  THIS story ""twists"" every five minutes.

On my second viewing of the movie my greatest regard is for John Malkovich himself, who not only allows himself to be spoofed, but participates in the spoofing with great gusto.  On the first trip ""into Malkovich"" we track him as he's getting ready to go out.  He goes down to the street where a cab is hailed for him.  The driver looks back and instantly recognizes him.

""Hey.... you're that actor, aren't you?""
""Yes"", Malkovich replies.
""I loved you in that movie where you played the jewel thief"".
""I never played a jewel thief"". (Although a few years later John Malkovich actually does play a jewel thief in Johnny English.)

A few other times other characters bring up his performance in the jewel thief movie - a great running gag demonstrating how easy human nature makes it to spread urban legends and other incorrect information.

John Malkovich has been in a large number of my very favorite films: The Killing Fields, Dangerous Liaisons, Places in the Heart, Shadow of the Vampire, In the Line of Fire and Of Mice and Men. (Fans of ""Sex and the City"" will enjoy the moment when Willie Garson walks by Malkovich in a restaurant and compliments him on his performance in the movie where he played ""that retard"".) Now one of my favorite John Malkovich movies is the one that bears his name.",1088208000,3,3971,4.764963503649635
1075763,5,630580706X,"This movie is different from any other movie ever made.  It is a fun trip that raises many thoughtful questions.  WARNING:  DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU SUFFER FROM PARANOID DELUSIONS OR SUBSCRIBE TO MATRIX-TYPE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  It will send you over the edge.  The basic story is that down-on-his-luck wanna be puppeteer John Cusack reluctantly gets a day job at the gentle urging of his frumpy wife (yes they make her a frump) Cameron Diaz.  This day job changes both their lives as Cusack discovers a portal that leads to John Malkovich's head.  Nothing and no one is what they seem, and it is very hard to see who is controlling who, even at the very end.
I can't imagine John Malkovich's face when he was approached with this screenplay.  I can't believe anyone in his right mind wouldn't run the other way when presented with even the most basic premise for this film.  But then again, at least in the movie, Malkovich is anything but in his right mind.  Heck, for most of the film, he isn't even IN his mind.  Creepy, huh?  Creepy doesn't even begin to cover it.  But I highly recommend it.  Just be warned not to drive or operate heavy machinery after seeing it.
This movie is best watched late at night.  Most of the scenes are in fact shot at nighttime, adding positively to the surreal effect of the story.  Cusack, Diaz, and Malkovich turn in wonderful performances.  Catherine Keener is suitably hateable as the selfish Maxine.
This movie encourages you to look deep beneath the surface of a person.  It is also good for some serious out-loud laughs.",1086134400,,1568,4.59927797833935
1075854,5,630580706X,"Warning:before watching this film you should realize that this could be one of the weirdest, craziest film of all time. It kept me scratching my head.
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer who is struggling for stardom in fame. In order to put food on the table, Craig decides to get a job. He finds himself as filing clerk. He then discovers a portal to the mind of John Malkovich. The portal allows you to be John Malkavich for 15. Your John Malkovich for fifteen minutes and then dumped in the turnpike of New Jersey. Then he falls in love with his co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener)Craig, Maxine, and Craigs current wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) charge $200 to let people be John Malkavich. But then as Lotte continues to go to the portal and then falls in love with Maxine, as Lotte continues going to the portal and being John Malkavich. It is then a war between Craig and Lotte of who's getting Maxine. It is a crazed script.
Personally out of this film I was just stunned. Watching this film once isn't really enough. It can be kind of disturbing in ways. Personally I thought the movie was a great success. But that's me, other people think it is a stupid film out of the story. But it is not, you will like it. Really before watching this I didn't even know who John Malkovich was, and still technically don't. And its weird to see someone play themselves.

1075855,3,630580706X,"I purchased this film with high hopes, being an aficionado of off-kilter movies.  And with a plot like Being John Malkovich's, how could I go wrong?  A downtrodden puppeteer, working on floor seven and half of an office building, discovers a portal into the mind of John Malkovich.  Even with such an intriguing premise, though, I felt this movie struck out (I am in the minority in feeling this).
Let me first say that all of the primary actors performed brilliantly.  Cusack played both the melancholy and crazy sides of Craig the puppeteer quite well, and Diaz really shone as his quirky wife.  One of the best performances was by Malkovich himself, lampooning himself quite handily and playing the different ""inhabitants"" of his body as adroitly as he played his own self.
However, even these brilliant performances don't save the movie.  Fantasy is a difficult genre to conduct successfully, contrary to popular belief.  One of the unwritten rules of fantasy is that, no matter how fantastical the story, it needs to be internally consistent.  The film fails miserably in this aspect.  Sometimes only a single person can inhabit Malkovich, sometimes multiple people.  Far-fetched explanations about the subconscious and the ""power of the puppeteer"" attempt to account for this discrepancy but ultimately prove insufficient, if you follow them through to their logical conclusions.  The writer also throws in several random occurrences with no apparent connection to the idea of the portal.  Why, for instance, does Malkovich end up in a world full of people who look like him when he goes through the portal?  Is this some play on his ego?  On the nature of how we see the world?  I really don't know, and I don't think these inconsistencies were meant to be ""things to make you go hmm,"" as in other films.
And I suppose that's really what really bothered about Being John Makovich.  The idea is a fascinating one, brilliant even, with so much potential.  But that potential is squandered for cheap laughs: a lesbian affair through Malkovich's body, chimpanzee childhood traumas, lecherous old men, etc.  Instead of harnessing the inherent ironic humor in the idea and making this a thought-provoking movie, the writers used the idea to string together several cheesy laughs characteristic of other Hollywood comedies.
As it is, I give Malkovich a star for good acting and another star for a nice idea.  For a real five-star, absurd, ironic, and absolutely fascinating comedy, I recommend Fight Club.",1082160000,4,2505,5.036407766990291

The first part was amusing but bizarre; the second half ruined the first half by introducing sexual perversion. If you are going to take drugs and write scripts, please use the SAME drug and don't mix them randomly.
This could have been a great movie, and there are some good spots, but essentially it's a waste of time. Get something better, like Amazon Women from Mars.",1078617600,4,459,4.679012345679013
1075857,2,630580706X,"Not good at all
I was expecting ""Being John Malkovich"" to be a sort of trippy ride like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""  but I must say that I much prefer the later in terms of screen madness and insanity. BJM does stall a lot of the time and there are many dull moments in-between the bouts of lunacy. I certainly prefer the director's latest work ""Adaptation"" to this vehicle.
This film revolves around a puppeteer who manages to find a portal through a door in an office into John Malkovich's head. What a great premise! This boasts of originality through and through. Sounds just like what we need. I was really looking forward to this one. I like little cult items that do things differently.
However this is really a very mixed bag. You can tell that a lot of people in this movie are here to help out a friend. Some actors take their role a way more seriously than others. There is a lot of diversity in the quality there. I guess the reason why people went to see this film was to see Hollywood go wacky. It does just that, but is a tad bit embarrassingly executed as if you are watching the actors pour out their hearts on the Jerry Springer show. That is certainly not my kettle of fish. Maybe you will like this and I am sure that there are many people who simply adore this film but that was strike one for me. I do not like that sort of thing because it makes me feel uncomfortable to be honest and I found it hard to enjoy anything after that. I have read other reviewers here who did not like the film because of this either.
Strike two for me was the fact that the film's premise is limited to this ""nutty"" concept. It does not go outside of it much and when it does it can get extremely boring. The relationships in this movie are not fleshed out. When the divergence in acting quality meets up outside of its core theme the movie does falter into the realm of amateur film making. This can be forgiven for the director's newness but it is, frankly, boring.
The third Strike came in the form of a dud presentation. This is just NOT THAT WACKY. It does not get much crazy outside of the theme of going into Malkovich's head. A lot of it is simply executed in some way or another to look strange, but it just LOOKS strange and is not that cerebral at all. I expected this film to mess with your mind a bit more but it does not really do that. It just looks wacky but does not execute much intelligence along the way. Ultimately this is a bore.
However I will give it Charlie Sheen who saves this movie from one star purgatory. This vehicle is worth seeing for his performance alone. Overall this is ""designer mainstream Hollywood wackiness"" that can play to all audiences but is certainly devoid of making that extra leap of the consciousness that it pretends to expound on. This is no 2001 or Jacobs Ladder or Lost Highway. This is more akin to a dark version of a Police Squad movie. Not my idea of a wacky film, but a lot of people might like it and this review should not put you off trying it. I just did not like it at all and felt letdown by it all. It certainly does not live up to the hype for me for the reasons I have stated above. IMO, watch ""Adaptation"" instead.",1074124800,3,3191,4.231147540983606
1075858,4,630580706X,"This is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction, part love triangle romance, and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships, marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution.  Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commended for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be.  To analyze this film is very much beside the point, but I'm going to do a little bit of that anyway.
John Cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart.  Cameron Diaz is his hard-working mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their New York apartment.  An early scene shows her going off to work while Cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep.  Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her.  She, however, is not so enamored.  She is not attracted to Cusack at all and tells him so, and finds Diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of John Malkovich, who plays himself.
Offbeat enough?  Not yet.  Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast-fingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a New York high rise.  The floor is just about four and a half feet high (low overhead!) so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up.  Orson Bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with Mary Kay Place as his annoying secretary.  While filing Cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet.  He pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little Alice in Wonderland door.  He opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh! is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life.  Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing.  He is BEING John Malkovich!
Okay, we have our strikingly original premise.  Where the film goes from here is the tough part.  It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel.  I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz.  I was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality.  The old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of Cocoons (1985).  But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph.  But enough of these beguiling hints about what happens.  See it for yourself.",1073001600,2,3141,4.669090909090909
1075859,5,630580706X,"I saw this movie with others and they all said, ""What the f*ck?"". I was amazed that a director that could put together a piece of artwork crazier than a Picasso paintaing but it all fits together through some sort of weave. Each minute the movie gets crazier and crazier with its doubtful plots about going into the mind of John Malcovich and bieng dumped out on the side of a highway. Cameron Diaz did an excellent job potraying the confused wife who goes into the portal to fulfill her sexual desires for Catherine Keener who becomes John Malcoviche's love interest. It was refreshing for her to play such a powerful role instead of the dumb blonde she usually portrays. John Cusak also did excellent as the troubled pupeteer who completely takes over Malcovich's body and mind controlling his life and fulfilling his life on becoming a professional pupeteer with Keener as his new companion. The movie endlessly goes nowhere but it was delicously entertaining and I strongly recommend it if your sick of the action/blood/guy-gets-girl themes in most movies today.",1072051200,,1066,4.895027624309392

I can also assure Mr. John Malkovich that I will avoid anything else he's in from now on (I don't even want a glimpse of this one, the title was more than enough: although almost all actors/actresses are known for some nombrilistic tendencies, I'm sorry to see that Mr. Malkovich can put himself on the same level as Madonna)",1071360000,5,899,4.689873417721519

""Being John Malkovich"" is one of the funniest and most original films I have ever seen in my life. The script is amazing with its combination of puppetry, infidelity, and out of body experiences. The love triangle between Keener, Diaz, and Cusak is extremely well done, and fun to watch. It is also extremely funny, because they are only attracted to each other when they are inside Malkovich. The three really offer top notch performances. However, the best performance of all was given by the man himself John Malkovich. John is extremely funny in the role, and gives an accurate portrayal of what one would go through in his situation. Watching him as a puppeteer,will have you in tears from laughing so hard. The camera work on this film is outstanding. The film is actually shot at times, from the inside of John's head, looking out.
This extremely funny, and bizare film is truly one of the best films that I have seen in the last couple of years. The plot is extremely interesting and creative, the acting is perfect all the way around, and the camera work is amazing.

1075862,3,630580706X,"Let's get the praise over with first.
This unconventional movie starts with a very intriguing notion, brilliantly surreal and off-centre, basically something very different from mainstream cinema but still playful and fun. It rakes up some thoughtful issues --
(1) The real sexual desires buried deep in human minds;
(2) The need of ordinary folk to want to be someone else, someone more *seemingly* glamorous than themselves;
(3) The expressiveness of the puppeting medium; some of the puppeteer sequences are simply breathtaking;
(4) The swiftness with which people would pounce on the weakness of other humans to start making money;
(5) In parts, the jerk-a-tear statement about animal bondage;
(6) And tying in all these loose sub-ends, the ultimate notion of freedom and love of self, etc etc.
All that is well and dandy, and this is easily one of the most creative movies out of Hollywood in recent times.
However, having just watched it a second time I must say it's a bit of an empty shell once you get beyond the surprise factor. I didn't laugh, I smirked the odd time, and certainly my heart wasn't warmed - it's a very cold movie really, nothing wrong with that, but it's hardly one that will merit lasting affection.
It's a strange mixture really, because there is some sort of pretension to art at times, yet at others the characters and the emotions are paper-thin. Yet we're supposed somehow to be affected by these characters despite the fact that the film mocks and satirises them at every opportunity - the difference between this and the Coens is that they love even their most repellent characters and it rubs off on you!
In the end my reaction to this is the same as to the Naked Gun or one of those broad hit-and-miss comedies - it's the same schtick. Towards the fourth quarter of the movie, I was just hoping it could all be put to an end soon.

1075863,5,630580706X,"""Being John Malkovich"" is one of the most daring, strangest, and original movies in years.  We meet unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), tepidly married to wife Lotte Schwartz (Cameron Diaz), who has filled their small apartment with psychologically damaged zoo animals.  Craig is only engaged when practicing his artistic puppetry (the film opens with a puppet doing the ""dance of despair"").
Craig finds a want ad for a ""fast-fingered"" man and is hired as a filing clerk, on the 7 1/2th floor of an office building.  The ceilings are less than 5 feet high, and everyone walks around stooped.  His ancient boss wants to talk about his ancient sexual conquests, and the boss's secretary deliberately mistranslates everyone's speech.  So, loser Craig now has oppressive home and work life, when he meets the devious Maxine (Catherine Keener).  Craig falls for Maxine, Maxine couldn't care less about Craig, and lets him know in the nastiest way.  Craig doesn't care.
One day he finds an opening behind a file cabinet and follows it into... John Malkovich's head.  For 15 minutes Craig experiences Malkovich's ride in a taxicab.  Then Craig is dumped by the side of the NJ Turnpike.  He tells Maxine all about it, and she immediately sees the business possibilities.  Craig goes along, wanting to please her.  Lotte meets Maxine and also falls for her.  Maxine decides she prefers Lotte, but only when Lotte goes through the portal and is ""being John Malkovich.""  Craig, by now insanely jealous, locks Lotte in the chimp cage and becomes Malkovich himself, knowing Maxine has a ""date"" with ""Lotte.""
And things continue from there, plenty more plot I haven't told you about, such as what happens when Malkovich finds out about this business venture!

Anyway, puppeteer's working as a file clerk on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan office building; this idea alone might serve as the comedic basis for an entire film, but Jonze and Kaufman are just getting started. They then totally turn the whole thing around into some and stupid film full of mindless sex scenes and then it finally ceases to be funny and just becomes stupid, so I recommend seeing something else like Say Anything or Better Off Dead, those are actually funny through out the duration of the film!",1049846400,2,1531,4.7164179104477615

Keep an open mind & marvel at how unattractive Cameron Diaz is portrayed here.  This film is a wonderful introduction into the amazingly out-there writing style of Charlie Kaufman, who reached an even better level with his Oscar nominated film Adaptation last year...

1075928,1,630580706X,"This movie seems scripted as if the screenwriter was involved in that parlour game where someone starts a story with a sentence and then the next person in line adds a line, and so on.  Except all the players commence the story after consuming some awesome 'shrooms. So yeah, its an amazing concept, and has some crazy premises and situations, and it is imaginative, but as is typical thoroughout the movie, the explanations of the basic concept of this film by old timers who aid the Cameron Diaz character are contrived and wholly unsatisfying.  By the end you're asking yourself ""what happened to the Cusack character?"", nevermind the Hollywood-politically correct coupling of the Keener and Diaz characters.  The movie has the feel that the writer took nearly his entire schedule writing the first half of the story, and that he finished the last half of the story in four hours to meet his deadline.
For those of you that say the movie satisfies your curiosity as to what it would be like to be someone else, in reality, the Cusack character is actually being himself only within the facade of Malkovitch's body.  In the late scene in JM's agent's office, where Malkovitch reveals to the agent of his impending ""career change"", JM takes on the persona of Cusack.  So what's the difference?  If that's all there is, then I'd rather be in Cusack's body.  And yeah there's the blatant, obvious, idea that one's talents are more well received if you're famous to begin with, but my 14 year old niece could have told me that, and I could have saved $8.00.
So rent it, watch it and forget it.  Its got nothing to say and is nothing more than a nihilistic roller coaster ride where all the great hills are at the beginning.  The roller coaster end up jumping the track, and you have to walk back to the park feeling only half amused.",1044835200,9,1831,4.6265432098765435
1075929,5,630580706X,"I avoided this 1999 film when it was in the theaters.  It looked just plain silly to me.  And yet, it's received accolades from critics everywhere.  And so I decided to catch up on what everyone was making such a fuss about and see the DVD.  Oh my!  What a film!  I've never seen anything so innovative and creative in my life!
John Cusak stars as an out-of-work puppeteer.  Cameron Diaz is his wife.  Catherine Keener is the sassy woman they both find attractive.  And John Malkovich plays a version of himself.  All are excellent actors.  And all are exceptional.  How the writer, Charlie Kaufman, ever thought up the premise is amazing.  And the director, Spike Jonze, certainly knew how to make it all fit together.
This is a comedy with depth.  And the laughs and insights keep getting better.  There's an office building with a floor numbered 7-1/2.  It's only 4 feet high and everyone who works there has to walk around half stooped over.  Then there's a secret doorway behind a file cabinet.  When a person crawls in, he or she falls down a tunnel and finds himself or herself inside the brain of the actor John Malkovich for a mere 15 minutes.  Soon, Catherine Keener and John Cusak are selling tickets to people who want to experience this.  Soon, too, Cameron Diaz gets hooked  - so much so that, with an interesting gender-bender twist of the plot, she finds herself being John Malkovich while making love to Catherine Keener.  And that's just one of the many sub-plots.
Sound confusing?  Well it's not.  It might sound silly, but as a viewer I was completely there with the story all the way, letting myself enjoy the twists and turns of the plot that just kept getting better as this intriguing tale moved along.  It's all very surreal.  And it's absolutely brilliant.
Later, I thought about all the themes it touched on.  The puppeteer theme had to do with manipulation, both with puppets and with real people.  Everyone was manipulated in this film, and different people pulled the strings at different times.  It also had to do with what it means to be a celebrity.  And what, actually, is identity?
I loved this film and hoped the DVD would have some good special features.  I yearned for insight into the making of the film and I wished there were interviews with the actors.  Instead, there's scene with an ""extra"" who had the job of driving a car back and forth all night so that the headlights would give the appropriate background for one of the shots.  And a scene where the director feels sick and throws up.  However, when I think about it, what can I expect from such off-beat filmmakers?
This is the most refreshing film to come out of Hollywood that I've ever seen.  It might not be for everyone but I thought it was great!  It therefore gets one of my highest recommendations.",1044748800,15,2806,4.586693548387097
1075930,3,630580706X,"As it will go without saying mid-way through the movie, ""Being John Malkovich"" is a film of comical distinction; it's a movie that cannot, and should not, be compared to any other motion picture in the business.  Spike Jonze gives us something we're not used to.  Although it's something we'd like to see more of, coming from a guy who'd spent most of his career in the music business.
But beside the strange plot, quirky characters and rarely seen 'sick' comedy, in lies a good movie.  John Cusack takes the starring role as Craig Schwartz.  Craig's a sad, almost depressed man who searches through want-ads looking for puppeteering jobs; which is comical in itself.  And sitting beside him there is Lotte, played by ""There's Something About Mary"" star Cameron Diaz.  She's an upbeat, postive animal-lover with hair that's so frizzy it's almost frightening.  With both characters being introduced, the movie's beginning is a bit slow, and let's us know nothing about anything.  But Craig's big break comes when he comes upon a job looking for 'fast fingers'; a filing job, in fact.  What's funny, is it happens to be on the 7 1/2 floor of a local office building.  Which, when you watch the movie, you'll understand.  So being a professional puppeteer, he nails the interview and gets the job.  Meanwhile, the movie's still moving at a rather slow place.  But then it starts to pick up, Craig puts his eyes upon a woman by the name of Maxine (Catherine Keener), who is a bit of a push-over.  And, being somewhat condescending, she laughs at him.  Anyway, to get to the point, Schwartz eventually stumbles upon a small door behind a filing cabinet.  Of course, being the straight-shooter-pursuer he is, he opens the door.  And while making his way down a tunnel of dirt, he soon finds himself inside the head of a human.  The human is, naturally, John Malkovich (who plays himself).  I'm sure by now you were wondering what the title had to do with the movie.  Well, there you go.  And that's where I'll leave you.  Malkovich's port-hole 'aperture', or whatever you desire, will turn out to be more than just a door, as Craig soon finds out.
I gave this movie only 3 stars because it lacks a strong start; something I feel is important in the making of a great film.  But, nevertheless, the movie is definetly worth seeing.  It is, as said before, categorized as comedy; and for the most part that's what it is.  Spike Jonze has made his presence felt in this business.  And if you see this movie, you'll certainly be moved whether it be in a good or bad way.  It has a great cast and features some funny cameo appearances, along with Charlie Sheen (who also plays himself).  Again, I can't compare this movie to anything I've ever seen, which says a lot.  All in all it's a respectable piece of work, and I'm looking forward to seeing Jonze's next film, ""Adaptation"".  It stars Nicolas Cage, and is out right now.",1044576000,,2914,4.634765625

It is a marvel to behold, a comedy with an outrageous premise, but told with great poignancy and emotion.  I can't even begin to describe the plot, or really say anything about the story for two reasons: (1) its so rediculously twisted that I wouldn't know where to begin, and (2) most of the fun of watching it for the first time is in not knowing exactly what the hell you're watching.  All the actors do an amazing job, but its not really the acting that stands out here, it's the inginous story.  Never have I seen a movie that is more constantly entertaining from beginnning to end (besides the imminent Catch Me If You Can).  The story starts, and you're happy that its so weird and offbeat.  Then comes the next 20 minutes, and what you thought was weird in the beginning is now Forrest Gump in comparison.  This trend continues throughout the film, the story constantly putting twists upon twists until the end.  And when the end is approaching, you're thinking, ""This movie is so great, it can't possibly end right,"" but it does.  And, oh man, does it ever.  What else can I say?

1075989,5,630580706X,"1999 was a very good year for films indeed, with Fight Club, Memento, Boys Don't Cry, Magnolia and Being John Malkovich all being released in the space of a year.  Being John Malkovich is probably the most promising debut of any director that I've ever seen, ranking right alongside last year's Lantana.  Directed by Spike Lee, formally known for making pop videos, this is as surprising as it is astonishing.  Telling the story of Cusack's disillusioned puppeteer who whilst working on the 7th and a half floor of an office building discovers a way into John Malkovich's mind, this is brilliant filmmaking from start to finish.  As the movie progresses Cusack's character falls in love with the seductive Keener.  It's just unfortunate that his animal-obsessed wife (Diaz in a completely unforgettable role, not just for her acting ability but for the fact that she manages to look dowdy) becomes obsessed with being John Malkovich and that Keener is in love with her inside of Malkovich.
It would be completely impossible to pigeon-hole this into any one genre.  Suffice to say that its a twisted love story fantasy science-fiction dramatic comedy.  What makes the movie though, as well as its sheer and consistent originality, is its performances.  Cusack and Diaz for once are playing the losers, the dowdy couple who appear doomed to a life of miserable boredom.  Keener as the maneater is also incredibly enjoyable, winning herself a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her multi-faceted performance that could so easily have fallen into parody.  Perhaps what is most delightful though is John Malkovich himself playing along with it all, poking fun at his public persona where nobody can remember any of his films and he's often overly dramatic.  Indeed, the scene where he enters his own mind just to see a nightmarish visual of his head imposed on other people's bodies, each one only able to utter 'Malkovich' can only be described as comic genius.
There are countless aspects of this movie that make it enjoyable, although probably the most refreshing aspect of it all is that it was made in the first place.  It would seem that hte public have become tired of blockbusters and are craving for something different.  Being John Malkovich is about as far removed from the typical Hollywood movie as you could possibly imagine and not something you'd perhaps expect to see big name stars in.  The only thing I can think of is that the actors read the magnificent script.  Equal parts nightmare and fantasy, Being John Malkovich is one of the most original Hollywood pictures ever released.  I can't recommend it strongly enough.",1043625600,4,2635,4.968109339407745
1075990,5,630580706X,"This movie, as you've read, is off-the-wall, yet it manages to ask key questions about the nature of identity. It's funny, constantly manic yet always interesting.
Catherine Keener deserved her Oscar nomination, playing Maxine as this vicious shrew who managed to find and find herself deserving of love. Nearly unrecognizable under a giant, frizzy wig, ministering to animals while trying to come to terms with realizing she's a man in a woman's body, Cameron Diaz gives the best performance of her career. And the switch given to John Cusack's character, from sad-sack hero to villain, proves his range. And Malkovich as Malkovich is superb.
Visually, it's stunning, as well. The puppet show scenes, occasionally hysterical, are just plain neat. And the scene where Malkovich enters his own portal is a particular highlight.

This is a great movie for people who aren't offended by husbands locking up their wives while they go to pursue other women. I believe John Cusak's character locks his wife up in an animal cage (twice) and binds her up with duct tape.  Another distinctive memory is the creative puppeteer making lewd public display (on a sidewalk) of lust between a nun and a priest.  I guess it's not for the religiously sensitive either.  As an aside, the wife eventully ""comes around"" and begins to lust after the same woman as her husband.  I'm sure I'm leaving out a lot of details from this dark, morally stunted movie.

Just the story synopsis sounds so crazy. A puppeteer working on the 7 1/2 floor (originally built for midgets) finds a portal leading to the head of real life actor John Malkovitch, allowing annoying entering it to be Malkovitch for 15 minutes before being spit out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Wow. And the movie is so much more weird then that. The first time I saw it, my mouth was wide open in shock. How did this movie get made? It's so crazy it's wonderful.
With such a the head-trip of a story, it's easy to skip over the wonderful performances by the cast. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz look and act positively convincing as a poor, ugly and strange couple in New York. Catherine Keener is superb as a power-hungry, greedy woman who Cusack and Diaz both fall for, and of course Malkovitch as himself is both strange and intoxicating. Is it how he really acts? You never really know. And that's part of the charm of this wonderful film. The line of reality and fiction at times becomes fuzzy. A characteristic that writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze play even more with in their follow-up Adaptation.
Of course, all this weirdness means this film isn't for everyone. Some will scoff at it's ""too cleverness"" or walk out thoroughly confused. But for those who love the theater of the absurd, this will be pure paradise. One of the most unique and memorable films to come out under the Hollywood radar in a long time.

A stunningly assured piece of work from video director Spike Jonez who toys with just about every conception of modern cinema there is. Cameron Diaz shows what a talented comedy actress she is, John Cusack carries off the male lead with distinction, John Malkovich is sporting as himself, but for me the films real star is Catherine Keener who smoulders with provocative sexuality and femme fatale appeal. Jones has very light touch, and although Being John Malkovich is a highly unorthodox film, you cant help but get [pulled] into the movie, which at times adopts a sort of Dogma-real-life- shaky-Handicam approach for a documentary-like authnticity.

When Craig is sucked into the door, he can be John Malkovich, an actor on Broadway, and boring Craig lives John's exciting life, meeting famous people and pretty girls every day.

This film gave me fresh ideas. I thought this film, made of questions, absolutely this film fixed my idea when I watched John Malkovich's movies.
The director, his name Jonze did a really amazing job. When I was watching the film I couldn't move away. And I couldn't understand what the director gives a message. I watched twice one day. Most people like romantic movies or science fiction.

But ""Being John Malkovich"" is totally different film. That helped me to make a think by myself. How about my life and If I John, what am I doing? Have you been enjoy yourself in life? Are you enjoying now?

Unjustly deprived of the award for Best Original Screenplay (losing to ""American Beauty""), Charlie Kaufman's magnificently absurd story works on so many levels: as surrealist fantasy, as a critique of our fascination with fame, as an acid inquiry into gender, power games and sexual manipulation, and, more simply, as just one hell of a funny trip. What's particularly impressive is that despite his story being relentlessly and increasingly ludicrous, Kaufman manages to tie-up all the loose ends and deliver an ending which is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious. He also gives us some of the funniest lines ever spoken on screen, to wit: 'Behind the stubble, the too prominent brow, and male pattern baldness, I sensed you feminine longing.' Spike Jonze extracts near-perfect performances from his high-calibre cast, with Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener cleverly playing against type, and John Cusack showing his incredible versatility.

How to describe this movie without giving away too much plot is tough here.  Take a look at the box, and see the larger picture.  You see a big head with a door leading into it. First, guess who's head it is.  Next, notice that there are three people inside of it.  That should give you enough clues to pique your interest, without giving away too many details.
But ""Being John Malkovich"" is not the only weird thing going on here.  John Cusack plays an unemployed puppeteer (yes, he plays with puppets) who is more or less pushed into an office job by his roommate Cameron Diaz in order to contribute just a wee bit to the finances of the relationship.  Once again I'll try not to give away too much, but a day's work here involves using an elevator in a very special way, walking funny all day, and being prepared to have your co-workers seen to not here a word you say are all part of it.
It is in this environment that the title action takes place.  Then, believe it or not, it gets weirder.  We see the adventures of the three that take on the title action, in different combinations.  We then get a special treat at the title character also takes place, and how it's handled is very creative.

If your taste doesn't match mine, you may not find it a 5 star movie, but it doesn't mean it's not enjoyable.

At times, finding something a little out of the ordinary is the key.  You want something that doesn't require you being completely braindead to enjoy, but you don't want something that's overly sappy or is basically a rewrite of thousands of other movies just like it.

Ideas and concepts are so conflicted, the world it portrays seems at times both upside down and the right way up. It is an effect nothing short of sensational success. To call this film clever wouldn't even touch on the whirlpool of fascinating themes it concocts. To call this film original is not even granting it the tiniest fraction of the laudation that its immensely talented writer's endless imagination deserves. It is both dreamlike and truthful. It is both scathingly funny and undeniably beautiful. And it is at all times utterly and unrelentingly magnetic.
We see scenes in which a tortured artist, a puppeteer no less who can only find an audience performing on street corners - a venture that often leaves him battered by offended onlookers, casually discussing babies with his dowdy, pet loving wife. It is so profoundly honest about the world that these not-so-ordinary folk inhabit and yet so aware of the audiences apprehension to relate to these characters. And that's precisely what this film wants, it throws this world ever so slightly off balance with some devilish sleight of hand only cinema can achieve, and then suddenly tips everything on its head, throwing the audience into a torrent of unreality and relentless wit.
We see a thrilling chase through a literal myriad of the private memories of a well known actor. We glimpse the painful childhood of a mentally unsound monkey named Elijah. We watch as third rate actors tell us how and why a secret floor of miniature proportions in a well known office block was built. And of course a scene that is already engraved in movie history, what exactly happens when a man enters his own mind. And yet as we witness this, there is something that is always maintained, no matter how wild and untamed the story grows, and that is the undying humanity of these characters, the incredibly poignant truth that is undoubtedly the core of this movie.

This movie goes by small dark places. It has a promising beginning: John Cusack starring in as a puppeteer with little money looking for a job. He has no children and has lost all the interest in his wife (Cameron Diaz). He starts working in the ""seventh and a half"" floor of an enterprise. This is placed between the seventh and the eighth floor and it's only 1,5 metres high, so he has to pull down the head to walk in all the time. One day he meets a beautiful woman at work (Catherine Keener) and he tries to attract her attention, but she ignores him. The things start to change when he discovers a secret door where he finds the power of  being able to see with John Malkovich`s eyes. However, this ability lasts only fifteen minutes and then, John Cusack falls in the outskirts of the city. He immediately tells all the story to that woman. At first, she doesn't care much, but she calls him on the phone later. Her idea is to write an advertisement in the newspaper and start a business: let people being Malkovich for a while after earning a lot of money. Everything is right then, but  it happens that Cusack's wife uses it when the other woman is meeting John Malkovich. They have a relationship, and it results that she is not making love to him, but to her, in fact. Malkovich realizes that he's not able to control his body.
The script couldn't be better, I mean, how can you imagine someone living in John Malkovich's brain? How can you imagine the funny idea of working in a ""seventh and a half flat"" and such a stupid story of how it became like that?
Another good thing in the movie are the actors. John Cusack's performance and Catherine Keener's are excellent; Cameron Diaz's character is well-depicted, although it's a bit strange to watch her acting in a movie like this, and John Malkovich doesn't really act, because the movie deals about this person, but he shows himself as an interesting and mysterious man, and I think that is the reason of why so many people want to be him. I found fantastic the scene in which he enters the secret door, and what surprise when he discovers a world dwelt by hundreds of copies of himself!
This is a movie you can't stop watching, and it's worth doing it several more times. I wait impatiently the next Spike Jonze's challenge.",1025308800,,2472,4.452538631346578

""Being John Malkovich' can't be satire.  Its
characters are too outrageously drawn to stand in
for just plain folks.  It is in its own strange
way a horror film, since it proceeds from a nightmare
logic all its own.  However, it replaces the glee of
that more simplistic brand of entertainment with a
neurotic need to batter itself, its characters, and
us, with endlessly glib tortures.  It envisions a
world where every desire is a joke, every emotion a
manipulation, every character a fraud.
The story begins with John Cusack's character, a
pretentious artist and sexually frustrated husband
married to a frigid frump of a wife.  Forced to
take a job, Cusack chases an attractive co-worker,
even though she's something of a soulless,
... shrew.  By means of a magic tunnel, all
three main characters enjoy life in another body,
until, after numerous kinky adventures (which are
not so much tongue-in-cheek as tongue-in-canker-sore),
the film winds its way to a heavily masochistic
conclusion.  Without giving too much away, Cusack's
characters ends up taking the brunt of things.
This is strange because his character seemed to be
the only one in the film with any ambition, dreams,
or a modicum of conscience.
Undeniably an interesting film, but, unable to justify
itself or its sexual politics, `Being John Malkovich'
is a frustrating and ultimately displeasing film.
I recall reading somewhere that the screenwriter,
Charlie Kaufman, is heavy into analysis.  Seeing his
movie, I'm not surprised.",1023667200,5,1514,5.126016260162602

(among his work are Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"",Bjork's ""It's Oh So Quiet"",Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"",etc.).
Since his videos are very offbeat yet fun and stylish I thought that he would bring that same appeal to the big screen.
Sadly no.""Being Jon Malkovich"" is just odd and depressing and at times very dull and stagnant. Nothing more really. Don't believe me?
Then i'll try to summeriaze the plot ,an out-of-work puppeteer(John Cusack)
gets a part-time job as a file clerk. There he leads into a portal
into the mind of actor John Malkovich. He,his witty co-worker
(Catherine Keener) and eccentric,pet-loving wife(a ghastly-wigged
Cameron Diaz) devise a scheme to let anyone go through the mind of Malkovich just for $200 a pop. Strange,huh? That's not all,
the kicker is that you only get to become Malkoich for a matter of minutes until you're dumped off the New Jersey Turnpike.
As I said,this film is VERY strange(oh,yeah,I forgot most of this happens on the 7 and 1/2 floor of the office;don't ask me!).
""Being"" comes off as a mix of bizarre ""Saturday Night Live"" skit,
benign sci-fi flick,and weird exploration of celebrity obession and self-worth(again,don't ask me!).
The movie isn't neccesacarily bad nor is it ""outstanding"",it's just well,too odd to really judge. But to point out the postive points,I can say that Jonze's wry,(VERY) offbeat humor and the film's sparse direction is creative and at times,strangely enticing.(Yet this movie is way too dreary and it's very depressing for some reason).
If you know Spike Jonze,you know that you're in for a weird,wild ride and ""Being"" promises to be just that but just adds up to being weird.
P.S.:The DVD features are intresting though. The bizarre TV spots,
weird segments(one page features a in-depth look at puppetering),
blank page,and an interview with Spike Jonze(which ends with Jonze vomitting) are worth giving this film a try...if you like your cinema a little bit strange...",1021852800,3,2075,5.102941176470588

1076079,5,630580706X,"In the annuals of movie comedy history, there has never been anything quite like Being John Malkovich. I hope there never is again, not for negative reasons, but because it should float out there forever like some special little planet. Then, decades from now, people can look back and see a unique sample of where originality was at the end of the Twentieth Century. The following plot information should be enough to say whether or not it belongs in your universe. Obviously, it fits in fine in mine.
Craig Schwartz is a gifted and frustrated puppeteer. I think all puppeteers are frustrated, but manual dexterity is not a talent of mine. I don't hold a ball-point pen. I have to clutch it, or else I flip it across the room. Craig lives in New York with his wife Lotte [Cameron Diaz], who runs a pet shop. She has a bad habit of bringing injured or frustrated animals home. The house is a menagerie. We quickly see that both of these people are highly manipulative. When Lotte suggests that Craig find a normal job [just until his puppeteer career takes off, of course], he grudgingly starts looking for one. He spies an ad from The Lester Corp. that seeks a short person who can file quickly. When he arrives at the building listed, he looks at the directory, only to find that Lester is supposedly on floor 7 1/2. Indeed, it really is. The floor is two-thirds the height of a normal one. Propelled by curiosity and a sense of the ridiculous, Craig goes ahead and gets the job.
Working at Lester Corp. is a challenge that goes far beyond having to walk around all day stooped over. The Executive Secretary literally does not hear what anyone says to her. She isn't deaf. It's worse than that. Everything said to her is translated into something else. She's straight out of Alice in Wonderland. Dr. Lester [Orson Beane] thinks about nothing else but chasing women. He's 105 years old. And as for coworker Maxine [Catherine Keener], she is nothing short of insane - not homicidal, but simply mad as a hatter. Yet for a puppeteer, who dreams of performing at Lincoln Center, and for his wife, who lives in her own furry critter world, the situation is not that far removed from their own reality.
One afternoon Craig accidentally knocks some papers off a file cabinet. He has to move the cabinet to retrieve them and discovers a little door. He opens it and finds a cave-like passage, just big enough for him to crawl into, which, like any sane man, he promptly does. Suddenly, the door slams shut behind him, and a sudden great wind propels him down a long tunnel. He finds himself peering at the world through someone else's eyes. That someone looks in a mirror, and Craig realizes he is inside the real John Malkovich's head. He is fascinated by this phenomenon, but soon enough he goes flying out and crashes onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.
There is much more to the story, but this is more than enough to tell you if you find it very original or unimaginably stupid. If the story is to your taste, there is more good news. First-time director Spike Jonze, who made a name for himself doing music videos and commercials, is an astounding talent. He has learned a lot in his twenty-nine years. I don't know if he cast the movie, but the choices are shrewd because Cusack, Diaz, Keener and Mary Kay Place all have played in a number of original, off the wall or screwball comedies. Here are a few of the titles: The Player [1992], Grosse Pointe Blank ['97], My Best Friend ['98], There's Something About Mary ['98] and Pecker ['98]. I recommend all of these. These actors are obviously at home in this kind of movie. As a film buff, the icing of the cake is John Malkovich. This is the first film comedy of his long career, but here he is, not only surviving in style in this madhouse, but also playing himself.",1016496000,,3824,4.535455861070912

1076146,5,630580706X,"I remember first hearing about ""Being John Malkovich"" more than a year before it was released to theatres.  At that time it was just a title, a concept, and a guarantee that Malk (and Cusack) would be involved.  Stunned at the bravado and imagination, I couldn't wait to buy tickets.  Sadly, sometimes anticipation ruins the result, and I left the theatre disappointed, if not a little bored.
Having recently seen the movie again, I found myself enjoying it immensely, buying in to its eclectic concept and execution wholeheartedly, while holding a silly smile on my face the whole time.  This second experience leads me to a conclusion that dovetails nicely with one of the film's major themes: I'm not the same person now as I was then.
Director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman realize their vision with exuberance and melancholy, which, although paradoxical emotions, make an easy fit together.  Kaufman's script cares not for the rules of the physical world or sane human behaviour.  This apathy allows him to go down roads other screenwriter's have not the talent or the courage to travel.  Jonze, he who cut his teeth on Beastie Boy, Weezer, and Fatboy Slim videos and who's iconoclastic vision reminds one favourably of his musical namesake, achieves Kaufman's vision so sublimely you'd think the two men sprung from the same artistically fertile womb.  They could have made a perfectly banal movie, and only included the marionette sequences, and it still would have been fascinating.  Throw in the 7 1/2-floor orientation video, Dr. Lester and his deaf receptionist, the ingenious celebrity cameos, and the 'Dance of Despair and Disillusionment', and you've got yourself a unique and fascinating vision.  Top it all off with the stunning ""What happens when a man goes through his own portal"" scene (where the word 'Malkovich' loses all meaning), and I can't think of a way they could have improved this movie.
(Re-reading the above paragraph, it's amazing to think that not two hours ago I would have called anyone who'd written such rubbish a frantic imbecile; ah, how quickly the tune can change when the orchestra is given time to practice...)
John Cusack is miles away from Lloyd Dobler country, and yet he still manages to hit the role on the sweet spot.  His Craig is an open wound, festering from lack of love and attention.  Cusack makes him uncomfortable to watch, which is a neat trick because Johnny boy's roles usually go down smoothly.  Like the rest of the actors here, he subverts his own persona (and others'; he's a puppeteer, natch), in a movie about subverting personae.
Others themes to watch for (and this is by no means an exhaustive list), include the meaning of the individual and the self, loneliness, obsession, genius, unrequited love, existentialism, capitalism, ethics, morality, celebrity, theology, immortality, passion, art, the tortured artist, vanity, inspiration, and of course, fractional numbers.  It tackles all the big themes, and it tackles them hard.
Why is Cameron Diaz in this movie? I asked myself upon first viewing.  Why bring her aboard, and then waste the one reason why you would cast Cameron Diaz, i.e., because she looks like Cameron Diaz!  Putting her in a fright wig, and never letting her near the shower just seemed counterproductive.  Well, on further review, she actually does a fine job in both creating her character and subverting her glamorous Cameron Diaz persona.  She shows longing and frustration, and then ecstasy with ease, and is able to pull off some of the deadpan absurdity that Lotte's dialogue requires.
Catherine Keener proves that if you need someone to play a sexy ice queen, then she's your girl.  Ratcheting up a notch her work as a similar character in ""Your Friends and Neighbors"", Keener is a vital life force, giving energy and vitality to a film peopled with losers and freaks (that's the film's message, not just my opinion).  Whenever she's onscreen, you fear for your life in the audience, for she just might lash out through the screen and slap you where you sit without blinking an eye.  But, she's also able to sincerely play the more emotional moments, without believability and vulnerability.  I love watching this classy lady on film.  More Keener please!
Malkovich himself pulls off the film's best acting, especially when he has to portray what happens while Craig is inside his skull.  It's a trick that Cage/Travolta tried to pull off, without success, in ""Face/Off"".  Here, Malk and Cusack form a superior tandem (having worked together previously in ""Con Air""; that's not the jewel thief movie everyone is talking about, is it?).  Malk details Cusack's mannerisms with spot-on accuracy.  But there are other moments where Malk mocks himself, his celebrity, and his supposed lifestyle.  Scenes showing him earnestly rehearsing ""The Cherry Orchard"" and ""Richard III"", greeting obtuse fans who praise him for his sensitivity in playing ""retards"", or passionately ordering bathroom towels from a mail order catalog not only subvert his persona, but deconstruct it, and then deconstruct it again.  This movie wouldn't have worked if Malkovich had no sense of humour about himself (His advice to Spike Jonze upon taking the role: 'The crueler the better'; ""Being Tom Cruise"", while probably a bigger ticket, wouldn't have packed the same punch).  Kudos to him for getting, and running with, the joke.
[The DVD is loaded with quirky video pieces, such as the entire orientation video and Malkovich-as-puppeteer documentary, both featured in the movie; plus, it has an odd behind the scenes look at one of the extras driving along the Jersey Turnpike, and a mock interview with Spike Jonze that's a dirty gag in more ways than one]",1012953600,,5743,5.040169133192389

One movie that possibly inspired BJM, and did in fact manage to sustain its surrealist tone is Tom Schiller's Nothing Lasts Forever (1985), which was never released due to poor audience testing in Seattle. Seattle deserves a little seismic spank for depriving America of this neglected gem. The plot, as in BJM, takes place in New York sometime in the indeterminate future. The Port Authority has declared martial law, and struggling artists must negotiate with bureaucrats to fulfill their aesthetic labor. Stylistically, the tone is a retro homage to the New York of the late 1940s when bohemianism had an intellectual edge.

I've followed Spike Jonze's career for years, John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and Cameron Diaz... Well let's just say that my feelings towards Cameron Diaz are pretty much the same as every other hetrosexual male's. So this should have been a slam dunk. I liked the concept of the film (whatever else you think of it, you must give it kudos for its originality), the reviews were glowing. I was receptive, pumped and I was primed.
Then I saw the film...
And I did hate it with every fibre of my being.
There was not a single character I felt any affinity to. I found the situations contrived and pointless. The ideas explored were either bland or annoying. Being John Malkovich left me with a general feeling of sliminess. I felt dirty. The acting was over the top and all I was left with was an uncomfortable desire to slap everyone involved.
Was my reaction a little extreme? Perhaps, but don't let it get you down; I'm clearly in the minority here. People love this film. They go on and on about it, so if I've missed the point, well, my opinions are hardly going to drown out the true believers. But what if I'm right and they're the ones who are wrong? What if there are good, film-loving folks out there who are just embarassed to admit they don't get it?

It does try. Lord how it tries. But it doesn't work. The humor is forced and self-conscious, too indulgently pleased with its own quirkiness. Don't be distracted by how kooky everything is -- pay attention to the jokes and the way they're delivered, think about them. They're not funny. Well, all right -- we'll be fair. They're RARELY funny. John Malkovich does have his moments, and Charlie Sheen was a nice touch.
The characters are annoying. I disliked them and I disliked the performances of the actors who played them. Malkovich was acceptible; Cusack, Diaz, and Keener all raked on the nerves. I sense that, to some extent, these characters were designed to be unlikable. If so, they were designed well.
Understandably not content with being a comedy (since it's not especially funny), Being John Malkovich gradually treads into darker and ""deeper"" territory. What is identity, really? Why are there so many people who'd like to be someone else? What would it be like if they could? Would it be addictive? How would it impact the life of the ""possessed"" subject? Etc.
Trouble is, since the movie wasn't half as charming as it hoped to be early on, since the characters were all so strangely pathetic and annoying, and since the whole style of the film is jerky, abrasive, and deliberately unpredictable, my interest in such philosophical questions was not particularly aroused. It was evident in any case that this was a movie I would not be drawing anything too exceptionally deep from.

The film tells the story of an out-of-work puppeteer (an excellent John Cusack) who discovers a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played, curiously enough, by John Malkovich!).
BJM is a claustrophobic workplace satire, a surreal sex comedy, a gender-bending love story, and an innovative blending of science fiction and fantasy. Furthermore, the film is a reflection on interspecies communication and the nature of language, a metaphysical exploration of the nature of life and identity, and a somber meditation on the role of the artist in a consumeristic society.
Cusack and Malkovich are joined by a superb ensemble cast that brings complete conviction to this bizarre material. Orson Bean is particularly hilarious as Cusack's daffy, horny boss; he delivers his frequently outrageous dialogue brilliantly.
BJM is as notable for its stunning visual effects as it is for its amazing dialogue. Such sights as a giant Emily Dickinson puppet give the film a weird, Willie Wonka-ish flavor. Also marvelous are the parodic ""films within a film"" that spice up the whole. And the film is nicely enhanced by Carter Burwell's fine musical score.
BJM is imaginative and truly original; the film's concept is realized brilliantly by a talented cast and crew. I give it my highest recommendation.",1001980800,9,1460,5.190677966101695

1076236,5,630580706X,"The reason I give this movie 5 stars is because of a scene that lasts a mere 15 seconds: John Malkovich's experience when he enters his own mind. In this scene he sees everyone else as himself, and all these himselves utter only the word ""Malkovich"".
This scene made me reflect quite a lot, and I think that with it, Spike Jonze has uncovered one of humanity's biggest illusions (whether he did it on purpose is another matter): that there are ""other people"" around us. For even though we *perceive* other people as ""you"", or ""he"", or ""she"", or ""they"", this is not what they *are*. What they actually are is: I. For everyone is always I. Every life is lived by I. It would be easy to deduce that since every life is lived by I, then the logical consequence is that I live every life, but...
Did I just write ""but""? Small mistake. This 15-second scene opened my eyes. For 15 seconds, Jonze showed the world not as we perceive it but as it actually is; for 15 seconds, he showed The Truth, and for that I give the movie *****.",1000252800,2,1024,4.310880829015544

A wannabe famous puppeteer discovers a portal to Malkovich head which allows you to be him for 15 minutes . The guy deceides to try to use it for his financial profit with the help of his work-collegue Maxine ( Keener ) . Problems soon begin because his fiance Lotte ( Diaz ) tries to make her sexual turn a reality via the portal and he tries to get in bed with his object of lust Maxine with the same way .
The script has such high I.Q the viewer will have to see the movie several times to believe it . Jonze directs his film with a speedy , bold way . Scenes like the one where Diaz chases Keener into J.Malkovich's subconscious memories or the one where Malkovich actually enters his own mind are hysterical moments of a creative banquet . The characters nad further more the dialogues ( "" ... after dinner i'll introduce you to my chimp Elija "" ) are irresistably crazy and fun while all the cast delivers great perfomances . Special credit should be given to Diaz though who was brave enough to go after the role of the sexual frustrated Lotte and hide her good looks under a huge wig .

1076238,5,630580706X,"What a film. I mean, WHAT A FILM! Im struggling for reference points here. Being John Malkovich defies objective analysis. It cannot be judged alongside other, similar, films, because there are none. It is totally unique - and God only knows how anyone was persuaded to finance it. Or indeed how John Malkovich was persuaded to appear in it. But thank God they did, because this film is the most outrageously original, absurd, thought-provoking and hilarious mainstream film released in years. If this film was a person it would be diagnosed clinically insane. Leave your preconceptions at the door because they won't be of any use to you here.
The genius of Being John Malkovich is that it is played totally straight. It would have been easy for the actors (Cusack, Diaz, Keener and, er, Malkovich) and director (the fabulously eccentric Spike Jonze) to play to the more cynical viewers' jaded sense of irony, but this would have been a mistake. Instead Jonze has taken a much more interesting route, and the film thus seems unaware of its own barely comprehensible brilliance.
Most people will have an idea of the premise of the movie: struggling, tortured pupeteer Cusack gets admin job on floor seven and a half, discovers portal into Malkovichs brain, gets catapulted out onto New Jersey turnpike. The ensuing events I will withold for fear of ruining what, for me, was a journey I certainly didn't expect to take, and one that left me feeling like a child discovering snow for the first time. Wow.",998352000,,1503,4.852140077821011
1076239,5,630580706X,"This madcap journey through definitions of self celebrates, in the best possible way, everything the postmodernists have been babbling about. Layers of images lace into nests to rival the most greedy crow's, stealing unabashedly from the best in new digital effects (Malkovich malkovich malkovich?) and the worst in sci-fi gimmickiness (head swaps are not a new idea), not to mention an uproarious two-minute sequence from the perspective of a depressed chimpanzee. But from those nests hatch all kinds of unsettling questions.
Manipulation is a key to this film, as both Craig Schwartz, an emotionally needy puppeteer forced to get a day job as a file clerk, and his wife Lottie (Diaz) compete for the affections of Craig's saucy, self-centered new coworker Maxine (Keener), sometimes while inhabiting the body of John Malkovich.  Who's manipulating whom?  Craig's boss, Dr. Lester (caricature acting by Orson Bean), while evidently the mastermind behind the  entire philosophy-shattering portal phenomenon, is totally wrapped around the non-consonant-sensitive ear of his secretary. And Maxine, arguably the most grasping but in the end the most altered human in the film, conceives (pun not intended) what could be considered a crime against selfhood: the sale of another's experiences and identity ($200 bucks a fifteen-minute pop).  Who is whom, and who is pulling whose strings?  When Craig uses Malkovich's body to puppet puppets, which is the greater realization of Craig's art, his use of JM or his mastery of expression through wood-segment bodies?  (JM soi-meme plays a peculiar version of himself during those scenes when he isn't playing Cusack-playing-Craig.)  What reason, what morality, what intimacy can exist when people can commit theft of volition and adultery by proxy? Which selves really self-actualize (besides the chimp)?
Curiouser and curiouser, how different is Malkovich's own art from Craig's puppeteering or Maxine's power grappling?  All the characters are shown in their own worst lights, revealed as manipulative and selfish, capable of extraordinary cruelties despite their individual starts from almost cartoonish ordinariness.
Deliciously impossible, complex, and darkly witty a la Gilliam and Lynch, this film is studded with stellar performances by principals Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich and is directed by the unexpectedly keen Spike Jonze.  Jonze, to his credit, has engineered a visual world and character moments that underline the story rather than gilding it, as Hollywood generally prefers.  Almost X-Filesish atmospheres surround the depressed Craig while earth tones broadcast volumes about Lottie's real desires.  Subdued, like Malkovich's loden towels - but all the better to contrast the vivid reds and whites that signal power in this film.  The speed and dynamics, too, vary from the terribly honest dragging of a dinner night to two brainwrenching chase scenes through Malkovich's own levels of consciousness.
Like much made in the postmodern image, this film plays with dualities (compare dinner with Maxine and dinner with Dr. Lester; compare the women's starting and finishing motivations; compare Craig's dark surroundings and Emily's swin through the shifting lights), and then undermines dichotomies (man/woman; heterosexual/homosexual; self/other; will/action).  It flirts with left-of-center humor and demands viewer attention.  Like haute-cuisine, this kind of film is an acquired taste, and can be watched again and again for many ""flavors"" of imagery, style and idea.  For those who liked Gilliam's .Brazil., the novels of Flann O'Brien or Jeanette Winterson, or Derrida's .The Post Card., this is definitely a winner.  For those who thought .Fargo. was too art-school to be viewable, those who dislike dark humor or films with grotestque overtones, those who are going to see Cameron Diaz (unrecognizably frizzy), or those who find non-heterosexual intimate relationships unpalatable, this film may not be to taste.
So.  Two people who love each other end up together; some despair can be found in two other characters' fates, and some hope can be found in one character's resistance to another's will.  Is it a comedy?  That depends on whose head you've been in when the credits spit you out into your real world.  Have you, as the viewer, been manipulated into thinking this is a good film?  Absolutely.  And can manipulation, deception, and ugliness sometimes reveal beauty and hope anyway, and be funny while they do it?  That, I am told, is art.",997574400,2,4523,5.4762589928057555

1076337,5,630580706X,"""Being John Malkovich"" is about a secret passage that allows anyone who crawls down it to peep into the mind of the actor John Malkovich.  The film portrays the havoc that the existence of this passage engenders, both in the life of John Malkovich, and in the lives of those who utilize this passage to get their own cheap thrills.  For the record, those thrills may be ""cheap"" at first, but very quickly they become far more costly to those who pursue them.
The storyline of this twisted, darkly hilarious movie shuttles back and forth between the viewpoint of John Malkovich, and the  viewpoint of the people who discover the secret passage.  These people include John Cusack, as a professionally unsuccessful puppeteer, named Craig; his wife Lottie, played by an almost alarmingly de-beautified Cameron Diaz; the office babe that Craig and Lottie both lust after, named Maxine, who is gleefully played by Catherine Keener; and finally, the genteel, grandfatherly, yet completely deranged owner of the business which occupies the floor in the building where the secret passage exists... if you are still reading after that swamp of prepositional phrases that I just became lost in, the business owner's name is Dr. Lester (as in ""Lester the Molester"") and he is played by Orson Bean.
You must see this movie to appreciate the unbelievably twisted relationships these characters get involved in.  The best way to think of this movie is ""more twists and turns than a spiral staircase that has been filled neck-deep with neurotic pretzels.""  Actually, that doesn't even begin to describe how twisted this movie is, but it's a fair start.  After seeing this, I guarantee you will feel incredibly curious about how Spike Jonze came up with the whole idea.  Here's my opinion -- I think the movie got started as the result of a bizarre late night conversation between the director and his friends, probably amidst many empty beer bottles, bootleg Greatful Dead albums, and bags of Doritos.  My guess is that Spike and Co. decided to take the actor's craft and turn it on its' head.  ""What if,"" they may have asked, ""an actor suddenly had the tables turned upon him?""  An actor peeps into the minds of strangers for a living, to understand the characters he must play -- how would he like it if total strangers suddenly were able to do the same thing to him?  How would he like it if strangers seized the right to speak for him -- to literally put words in his mouth, and thoughts in his mind?  The result is the total chaos portrayed in this film.  If you think about it, all the main characters are really quite vampiric, or, you could even say, demonic -- they take over another person's body for their own purposes.  They basically possess him.  I think video libraries with a certain sense of humor could shelve this movie next to ""The Exorcist"" -- it makes a twisted kind of sense, if you think about it...
An interesting subplot is the commentary this movie contains about the nature of obsessive ""love.""  Craig and Lottie both lust after Maxine, but in order to be with her, their only option is to go through the body and soul of John Malkovich...  What does this have to say about this kind of ""love?""  Can we draw any lessons from this?  There was a song popular in the 80s, I forget who sang it, which was called ""Obsession.""  One of the lyrics went ""who do you want me to be/to make you sleep with me?""  Forgive me for attaching cosmic meaning to a basically forgettable 80s tune, but, well, if you see this movie you'll agree with me that it has a lot of relevance.
This is a seriously weird movie, but one you will never forget.  I recommend the living daylights out of it.  It's definitely worth owning -- you'll want to see it again and again.  Two thumbs way up.",995760000,4,3775,4.632132132132132

Are all of us inside someone else, bigger and stronger? Is somebody inside us?

Remember Borges' tales ""Las Ruinas Circulares"", ""El otro, el mismo"", ""todos los nombres, el nombre"", etc., and his riddles? It also has the problem of  the infinite, as when Malkovich gets inside of Malkovich. And it's impossible to forget the loneliness of the puppeteer, not being understand even for his wife. Since it is very complex and I don't want to destroy the plot, I must only say that this is a very recommendable movie.
For a former skateboarder, Spike Jonze's talent is not a surprise, since he is a legend in the skateboarding photography world. He used to make the most creative and intense pictures. I still believe that skateboarding world has given a lot of influence to the art panorama (e.g. Nirvana and their enormous offspring, but especially the graphic design world.)",995241600,,1157,4.903061224489796

John Cusack is his normal piquant self,regarding the proceedings with a bumused,but slightly over-it smirk. He has the most affecting raised eye-brows I've ever seen. Cameron Diaz plays his wife.

The scenes where he initially tries to woo the sultry Catherine Keener are almost painfully funny.  The success of this movie lies in large part with John Malkovich himself, who is not only gracious enough to lend himself to the premise, but who is subjected time and again to humiliating little potshots that provide some of the film's funniest moments (""Malkovich, think fast!"").  The first half of the movie is definitely the best, as the viewer is placed in one delightfully bizarre scenario after another, and the Maxine character ultimate bogs the whole thing down a little (What does she want?

A door which opens the portal into the mind of Oscar-nominee John Malkovich?  No way!  But its true.  I loved this movie!  The story goes: Craig Schwartz is at the end of his string.  A gifted puppeteer,  he cannot find any work to put his talent to good use. His pet-loving wife Lotte suggests he take an office job.  He begins to work at Lestercorp on the 7 and 1/2 floor.  That's right.  The elevator is stopped between floor seven and eight,  and a hilarious video which Craig views in his orientation explains the reason for this.  Craig accidently discovers a door in the wall, and he cautiously climbs into it.  He is suddenly sucked down a portal and sees everything through the eyes of one JOHN MALKOVICH!  Soon,  he and his beautiful partner Maxine begin to charge 200 bucks a head to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes,  then you are spit out into a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Got it so far?  Good.  John Cusack is astounding as Craig Schwartz,  an Oscar-worthy performance.  Cameron Diaz proves that she can be a great actress with her brilliant performance as Lotte.  Catherine Keener is excellent as Maxine,  her oscar-nominated performance. The truly wonderful performance comes from Malkovich, playing hmself of course,  but not all the time.  Though he is wonderful as himself,  he is taken over by Craig,  making Malkovich talk and act like him.  It is pretty incredible.  Strong supporting performances by Charlie Sheen and Orson Bean make Being John Malkovich a wacky thrill-ride.  Spike Jonze gives a incredible movie with his direction.

Score: 95/100
I will start this review by saying: Academy Awards. They've got it all wrong haven't they? Nominating The Insider and The Cider House Rules over this brilliant masterpiece is a huge mistake. Being John Malkovich attracted more attention to cinema-goers than both the two films did, and while they are extremely good ones, did not deserve to get nominated over this almost-perfect crowdpleaser, which should've got nominated for Best Picture and at least 7 other awards. And it only got nominated for 3 and didn't win any! Okay, okay, I'll stop the moaning and get on with the review, now. But that was a warning to the Academy to GET IT RIGHT the next time an immediate classic such as this comes along.
Craig (John Cusack), a puppeteer, takes a filing job in a low-ceilinged office in Manhattan. Although married to the slightly askew Lotte (Cameron Diaz), he hits on a colleague, the sexually frank Maxine (Catherine Keener). She's bored but snaps awake when he finds a portal leading inside John Malkovich: for 15 minutes you see, hear, and feel whatever JM is doing, then you fall out by the New Jersey Turnpike. Maxine makes it commercial, selling trips for $200; also, she's more interested in Lotte than in Craig, but only when Lotte is inside JM. JM finds out what's going on and tries to stop it, but Craig sees the portal as his road to Maxine and to success as a puppeteer. Meanwhile, Lotte discovers others interested in the portal.
This film is not only an immediate classic as I said earlier, but it's the best movie idea of the 20th century. And the script should've got more attention than it did, ditto the performances from Keener, Malkovich, Diaz and Cusack, all lighting up the screen with comical and enjoyable performances. Spike Jonze's direction however, was most successful for a debut, and the world is now dying for his next feature. But, at the end of the day, Charlie Kaufman's script is the part of this excellent film that makes it really worth watching, his comically ingenious writing is ultimately bizarre, but inspiringly clever and mind-numbing all the same.
You'll never see another movie like this. Please, make one day of your life better and rent this. Or just go and buy it straight out. Either way, you won't regret it.",984787200,5,2296,4.771356783919598

The reason I rented it was because someone recommended it as a ""good bud smoking movie"" (in other words, a movie you watch while under the influence of a mind altering substance). I don't do drugs, but this movie sure made me feel like I did. I felt all the experiences of a druggy: the highs and the lows. I felt highs during the beginning when I thought this was going to be a good and interesting film, and I felt withdrawal after discovering halfway throughout that it wasn't. Towards the end of the film, I was left pondering my own existence and my feelings of depression. I tell you, this movie definitely makes you feel like you're ON DRUGS. They should show this film to people who think they might want to take drugs (it'll make them change their mind real quick). But, if you are a marijuana user, I'll once again echo the sentiments of someone who recommended this film to me and say that it is, indeed, a good ""bud smoking movie"" and if you're not stay far, far away from it, unless you like films that depress you or make you feel suicidal.",983923200,,1160,4.425233644859813

1076568,3,630580706X,"To my mind, the desperate thirst for something original and fresh that has parched the metaphorical throats of so many film viewers of the 90s and beyond, is the chief thing that has compelled so many to proclaim this a ""masterpiece."" What it really is, is a daring but ultimately mediocre black comedy which tries to be too many things at once.
The premise has charm, it's true. John Malkovich couldn't have been a better choice for an oddball film like this, and he is the one actor involved who I feel I can give real, enduring credit to. He throws himself into the project without a trace of self-consciousness, going wherever the movie asks him to, having fun, and tackling tricky territory at the same time (it can't be easy to pretend that you're partially possessed by a dorky John Cusack, but Malkovich does it well -- probably playing Cusack's part better than Cusack himself does.)
Other than this, and the sheer volume of quirkiness that many seem to enjoy, Being John Malkovich is pretty weak. All of the major characters are unlikable and annoying, and only occasionally funny. I assume they are supposed to annoying -- to reflect our own imperfections, somewhat uncomfortably -- but I just didn't care for this tactic. It's awkwardly done. It isn't even exactly ""black comedy,"" unless black comedy is characterized primarily by awkward, schizophrenic, arbitrary jerks in tone and mood.
Feeling no affinity for the characters and being only marginally interested in the outcome of their highly unpredictable activities, it was hard to view their general descent into mutual abuse and emotional greed with much more than puzzled distaste. The metaphysical themes played up on towards the end are interesting in and of themselves, but, like almost everything else in Being John Malkovich, are melded into the overall project in a generally unsatisfactory fashion. The film will just decide: ""It's time to be serious and deep now,"" and that's that. Like the raining frogs in Magnolia, Being John Malkovich is full of strange turns that, though bold and original, are more contrived than earned.
As far as performances go, it's pretty much Malkovich's show. John Cusack's performance, although his character has a few funny moments, is irritatingly bad. Cameron Diaz fares better as his dowdy, animal-loving wife -- unfortunately, the character herself isn't very interesting or funny. Catherine Keener just acts bitchy and weird, as usual, and the fact that she happens to be the ""femme fatale"" here is kind of arbitrary.
Kudos to Charlie Sheen on a great cameo though. One of the best parts of this otherwise interesting but overrated film.",982281600,3,2652,5.015873015873016

Anyone care to answer these questions??? NO... all right then, I will. Simple: BEING JOHN MALKOVICH defies every genre ever created. If anything it's an art film. The story, concerning a struggling puppeteer who stumbles upon a tunnel into John Malkovich's head, is easily the strangest idea ever to be committed to paper and the direction is so off-the-wall you'll find yourself rubbing your eyes in disbelief every five minutes or so. But that's a good thing. If BEING JOHN MALKOVICH proves anything to it's audience it's this: CREATIVITY IS NOT DEAD IN HOLLYWOOD... it's just been waiting for director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman to come and snatch it up. And what a film they have made! Heartbreaking but humorous, wildly inventive yet strikingly simple... no other film can simply make you accept that a building has a 7 1/2 floor let alone make you really want to spend 15 minutes in the head of John Malkovich. It's all so amazingly creative and fluid that watching it is like witnessing a dream, something you're constantly surprised by yet extremel;y at ease with. Superb performances by John Cusack, Cameron Diaz (yes that really IS Cameron Diaz under all that hair), Catherine Keener, and even John Malkovich in a completely off-beat comedy-drama-arty contraption of a film.

1076572,5,630580706X,"For my money, this was the best picture of the year (1999), a startling piece with some great acting performances that left the competition in the dust along the Jersey Turnpike....In Being John Malkovich, the premise of the movie is hysterical and unique. John Cusack is a  down and out loser puppeteer, married to the gloriously frumpy and frizzy-haired Cameron Diaz (in a wonderful casting about-face), who had to abandon his puppetry ""art"" and head off into the real world for a desk job in order to pay the bills and support his wife's many pets.  He shows up at the 7 1/2 floor of a building, after a scene in the elevator that still brings a smile to my face when I think of it, and starts work at a bizarre company (where everyone stoops under a five foot ceiling) only to discovey a mysterious passageway behind a file cabinet which is a portal into the mind of John Malkovich.  All of this is directed by Spike Jonze in such an effective, unsensational manner that the outlandish plot and absurd setting become almost believable.
Anyway, without giving away too much of the plot, the movie kept me continuously guessing, and the acting performances were great. Malkovich playing himself was a riot,  and I loved the appearance of Charlie Sheen in a self-mocking role late in the film.  Jonze lampoons voyeurism, sexual identity, sado-masochism (a cage is prominently used) and  shameless opportunism for the almighty dollar.

There is so much to say about and the words you might read, can't do this movie right, because it's originality and class can't be described.  That's why I'm going to give you 3 points why this movie is worthwhile a night at the theatre (or on video before your TV set):
1) the story : A puppeteer, who has a hard time finding work, starts in a company who has its office at the 7nd-and-half floor. There does the puppeteer, Craig, discovers a tiny door which leads right into the head of actor John Malkovich.
2) the actors : John Cusack, Cahterine Keener, Cameron Diaz, John Malkovich,... ALL do a really great job to make their characters come alive.
3)the approach of the movie itself : this isn't just an one-dimensional comedy like ""American Pie"" or such, this is a satire, goofy comedy and dramatic love story in one.  With , sometimes rich, imagination, developed characterization, atmospheric music and a firm director, there is just to much to mention about this movie.
So, maybe some of you still don't have a clue what it's all about?  Well, so did I.  I wasn't prepared for what was to come.  Well, dear people, I can say you this : this is the most entertaining, moving, original movie of the last 5 years.

The ending is truly a sublime treat.  And how can John Cusack make us care about such an insipid character?  What a swell actor!  Best Picture of 1999, hands down.

It is such an audacious idea, expertly executed, it grabs your attention right from the start, grabs you by the scruff of the neck and doesn't let go. You finish watching the film feeling drained. They put YOU in John Malkovich's mind...and the experience is breathtaking.
To me, what makes this film so fantastic, memorable and above all, unique, is its refreshing originality. A film that is remarkably original, and, I believe also very hard to categorize. I wouldn't call this a ""comedy."" It is so much more than that. It works on so many levels. It is a metaphysical voyage through the mind.

On one hand, I love the world the movie sets up-- artsy puppeteers compete for public adoration (a sixty-foot Emily Dickinson puppet makes news, but a miniature Abelard and Heloise is relegated to street-corner performance); the idea of a portal into Malkovich's brain seems only mildly strange, and it is quickly turned into a run-of-the-mill commercial scheme.
At the same time, I think the writers got a little light-headed with their own ideas.  There are too many cornball jokes, lines or ideas that don't fit.  The whole plot about the old man achieving eternal life was too convoluted and wholly boring.  And worst of all, as has been said in many reviews, none of the characters are sympathetic.

Oh yeah it makes you think about persepective, mind control, and the soul but it also makes you laugh while doing so. It barely misses a beat. John Cusack couldn't be more perfect as the down-on-luck puppeteer. American Beauty was an amazing satire about America facing its own suburban nightmare--itself!, Magnolia was about coming to terms with the past and it ain't through with us.

It has comedic elements - a lot of them - and there's no problem going along with the antics: the portal into Malkovich's brain, the 7 1/2 floor (an oppressive work place if ever there was), the eccentric characters and the whimsical insanity of it all. Then the sneaky thing turns and bites, the comedic trance is broken, and you're watching an acid commentary on identity. All the performances are done well, especially John Malkovich's portrayal of himself. The others, John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, manage terrifically  with their roles. Their characters are unappealing, but that's the way it was meant to be. I think they represent every person who ever wished to be somebody else, or that the person they were with was someone else. Personally, I was touched by poor Lottie's lament that she wanted to be a man, with power. Yeah, Lottie, you're not alone.

I really like the premise and a couple of the scenes are hilarious... but the psychological overtones are a little too much.  They distract from the overall originality, and besically lower the enjoyability of the film.

You're not supposed to find the last half of the movie funny--it's depressing as hell, and it's designed that way.  You're not supposed to like the characters--they're all jerks, and that's deliberate.

A puppeteer named Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, who's great as always)gets a job in a business building on the 7 1/2 floor. He confides in the very tempting coworker Maxine (Catherine Keener) who shrugs him off thinking he's a loser. After finding a port hole in the mind of actor John Malkovich, Craig gets Maxine into his schence to let others in to Malkovich for $200 a trip. Craig's frizzy haired animal loving wife (played by Cameron Diaz, you can barely notice her in this great role) wants to go back in Malkovich more than once and likes the idea of being a man, and decides she wants a sex change and falls for Maxine, who Craig fancies. Hence, chaos, Maxine falls for Craig's wife, Lodi, but will only have relations with her through Malkovich.
This movie is the most original film of the year. I think the message in this film, at least for me was that we should be happy with are and not hold other people above us and just be happy with what we have and who we are. Because if you try and be someone else you'll end up like Craig Schwartz....(see the movie)

The plot as we all know it - puppeteer Craig(John Cusack) with animal-lover wife(Cameron Diaz) living out a simple but unfulfilled marriage.  In more ways than one, we are shown that - her need for a child, his aspirations to make puppetry his rice-bowl, her animals, his stories as performed by his puppets....
This takes into another world as Craig finds a portal/door into John Malkovich's mind.  All the true characteristics of the main characters start coming out.  Spike Jonze takes us into a world of confusion, real confusion within the mind trips into being John Malkovich.  But all within the confines of achieving what the characters really want for themselves.
John Malkovich delights in this ""role"".  He steals the title and the movie!!  John Cusack's performance is understated.  Diaz and Keener proficient.  Watch for the cameos by Charlie Sheen, Hoffman, Sean Penn, Gary Sinise etc....

1076721,3,630580706X,"Watching this film, I felt a great admiration for the sheer invention of it, the boundless creativity with which the writer and director attacked the subject. Being John Malkovich is full of strange characters, wonderfully creative moments, and a sort of lunatic atmosphere that starts to take on its own twisted logic after awhile. If you buy the initial premise (admittedly, a lot to swallow) that a man finds a little portal in the back of an office that leads into the head of John Malkovich, then you will be in for a ride for the rest of the film. If you're the kind of person for whom this ""makes no sense,"" then re-rent Bridges of Madison County and give this one a pass.
That being said, the movie is, ultimately, rather too quirky for its own good. The ricidulousness of the movie's basic idea precludes any sort of traditional, satisfying dramatic conclusion. It's not difficult to figure out, early on, that this is not a ""happy ending"" movie. Some of the characters are genuinely flawed, and in some places, unlikeable, but that fact is one of the few real human touches in the whole production. As such, the film takes on a rather tragic character that makes it hard to recommend with gusto.
If the basic premise of Being John Malkovich appeals to you, it's worth at least one look. At the very least, it's one of the most original films to come out in a long time, if not necessarily the most satisfying.

""Being John Malkovich"" is a hell of a film, and is uncategorizable in terms of it's genre. It's part black comedy, part fantasy, part drama, and part thriller that stars attractive people John Cusack and Cameron Diaz as unattractive people. Former 80's star turned respected actor Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a struggling Manhattan puppeteer with a message that no one will listen to and a job that no one will hire him for. Facing pressure from his wife (a really, really ugly Cameron Diaz) Lotte, a pet store owner, Craig gets a job as a filing clerk at Lester Corp on the 7 1/2 floor of an office building. He befriends Maxine (Catherine Keener), a sharp tongued office sexpot who turns Craig down at every shot. Craig also befriends his boss Lester (Orson Bean) a nice old man with a hell of a secret. While working, Craig discovers a door that leads him into the mind of John Malkovich of which he spends 15 minutes and then finds himself ejected onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Havoc ensues for Craig, Lotte, Maxine, and John Malkovich himself in this strange film. Spike Jonze has got the right timing to direct the scenes of this truly bizarre film. Having an incredibly offbeat tone, Being John Malkovich is one of the best films of the year and a standout of the different films that came out this year following American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, The Blair Witch Project, Dogma, and The Matrix among others. The DVD is surprisingly delightful minus any deleted scenes or commentary.

Yes indeed, words have a hard time expressing how much I despised this film.  It's clever, but that's ALL it is.  Much like a Thomas Pynchon novel, but at least you don't find all the characters (such as they are) in Gravity's Rainbow to be entirely repulsive.  Let's not mince words: the characters weren't just unsympathetic.  They were utterly, utterly horrible.  Human garbage.  Throughout the entire film all I could think was, why am I being forced to watch these people?  Evidently, I was suppose to find their evil little machinations somehow...""funny.""  The problem is, I don't find complete self-serving cynicism to be funny.  Indeed, I hope I'm not sounding like a Christian fundamentalist here, but I found this movie to be deeply offensive.  How can people find people who are quite willing to inflict insane psychic torture on another human being to acheive their own hedonistic ends amusing in any sense?
Don't get me wrong: I'm quite aware that a film doesn't *need* sympathetic characters to be worthwhile.  One of my favourite films is Trainspotting, which suffers from a similar lack.  The difference is that in that movie we weren't being asked to find wacky humour in the characters' behaviour.  I just don't find that acceptable.
I have friends who like BJM--and most of the Amazon reviewers seem to agree with them--and that scare me a little: are so many of us really willing to put aside all human feeling in the name of a few cheap laughs?  This film is suppose to be a breath of fresh air in a world of stale and unoriginal films.  Well, I ain't buying: painfully hip it may be, but it's also a very cruel and mean-spirited film, and I hated it.  Finis.",971395200,13,1772,4.73202614379085

This film starts off quite ordinarily, nothing really mad or weird happens.  Its just the story of an unemployed puppeteer (a very good one too, the stuff he does is amazing! - played by John Cusack), who has to get a job in a filing company, filing files.  His office is on floor 7 of a building, has low ceilings, and tiny doors.  Now the comedy begins.
Next he discovers a small door leading into what looks like a cave, he crawls in, and suddenly, he IS John Malkovich.  Fifteen minutes later, hesuddenly get thrown onto a turnpike outside of town! Now it does begin to get mad and weird, but in a good and even convincing way.  His wife - Cameron Diaz - is a dowdy frizzy haired animal lover, who wants to try it.  She loves it so much she decides that she has discovered the inner man in her, and wants to have corrective surgery!  (She wants to discuss the procedure with her doctor, an allergist!)  Malkovich begins to suspect, and.....well, I'd better not give away too much, but plenty of fairly strange and funny stuff happens.  Often you'll laugh out loud, other times you'll simply be amazed with an unexpected turn of events, but always you'll be sitting up and paying attention!
The plot of this film is unusual, to say the least, but it really pays off if you can suspend your disbelief so that you can into the film.  OK, so portals into other people's heads don't really exist, but if they did......  The acting is superb, John Cusack is very good, but Cameron Diaz is just incredible as his dowdy wife (even though I knew she was in the film, it was some time before I realised that the wife was her, so looked so different).  Also, John Malkovich playing John Malkovich is really something to see - you get to see him doing all sorts of humdrum things as himself (ordering stuff from a catalogue, eating breakfast,  having a shower....) and he discusses his problems with other showbiz people who play themselves as well.  The ending is good, with a little twist that surprises right at the end.
Overall, this is a really funny and surreal, but very accessible film.  Definitely one of the best of the year, it really stands out from the usual offerings of action, love and sci-fi that turn up regularly nowadays.  My advice:  get this film.",970704000,4,2283,4.502427184466019

There are surealistic moments that have the edge of wierdness made easier to handle by subltle comedy.  John Malkovitch is actually quite good at having a sense of humor.  He depicts his own life as rather boring and mundane - you almost wonder why anyone would care to be him - he leads a life no more interesting than anyone elses.  However it gets interesting because of interference from the principle characters, so in a sense no one gets to be John Malkovitch because the act of observing his life changes it.

It's funny, at the same time sad, to realize how people are so dissatisfied with their own lives & would even pay to be someone else, even for a very short time.  & to think that the people we admire are happy & content in their shell is a big misnomer as well!

1076822,3,630580706X,"Well it certainly was original. I've never seen any movie even remotely similar to this, so if your in the mood for an extremely surreal movie,  this could be good.  However it seemed like the whole movie was just being  wacky for the sake of being wacky at times. For instance, what was the  point of that whole half floor thing at the beginning? Was there some sort  of symbolism, or was that just plain weird? I don't want to give away too  much of what happens for anyone who hasn't seen it, but it seems to that  there were a lot of nonsequitors throughout the movie. Maybe it was just  too ""deep"" for me and all the different plot elements were  somehow thematically and symbolically unified, but i don't think so.
It  certainly was entertaining at times, but i know that when the movie was  over, the question in my mind was: what exactly was that movie about?",967680000,,867,4.389937106918239
1076823,3,630580706X,"This is one of those films that not everyone is going appreciate.
On one hand, the film is (as most every critic has already stated) highly creative  and original in both concept and story.  On the other hand, all of the  characters are generally unlikable and there are some very odd  moments.
Ironically, the only character the audience can really relate to  and have any stake in staying with throughout the whole movie is John  Malcovich himself (who is hilarious here, by the way).
In my opinion,  this picture walks a fine line between concept and execution--almost  bordering on ""gimmick as film"".  Then again, they did make an  entire movie out of ""Night at the Roxbury"", so what else can I  say?
Luckily, director Spike Jonze does manage to create some really  memorable scenes out of the bizarre script that, in and of themselves, are  quite entertaining.
Is this film a case of pot-head trip becomes  Sundance hit, or is it really as thoughtful as some of the critics say?  The only sure thing is that your mileage will *definitely* vary.

Forget about all those movies you've seen for the  past few years at the cinema's door step, this is like nothing you've ever  seen before. The idea itself is so bizarre and wacky it is almost beyond  believe, what's this film about? Well, it is exactly what it said on the  tin, people BE John Malkovich, see what he's seeing feel what's feeling and  taste what's he consuming. And they can experience it for 15 minutes for a  mere $200, following so far?
The main characters in this film is John  Cusack, he plays a talented puppeteer who can't seems to get a break,  Cameron Diaz plays his animal loving wife (she looks nothing like she did  in all her other films, I never thought she can look dreadful). So he took  a job as a file clerk (because he's good with his fingers) in an office on  the 7 and a half floor. Where he met Catherine Keener who plays Cusack's  co-worker and love interest, and John Malkovich plays himself.
And one  day Cusack's character finds a porthole to John Malkovich's mind in the 7   floor and that's where to the wacky and wonderful story begins. I won't  give away the plot twist here because the story is told so beautifully and  carefully that it would give anyone a surprise or two.
As for the acting,  it seems that John Cusack isn't capable of bad acting or even  ""alright"" acting, he is OUTSTANDING. Even Cameron Diaz fits her  role perfectly, Catherine Keener deserved her Oscar nomination and John  Malkovich should at least get an award just for begin such a good sport,  and not forgetting Charlie Sheen, I didn't see that cameo coming, oops. As  directions, Spike Jonze has truly put himself on the A-list for new  directors; I would never imagine the ""forth king"" in ""Three  Kings"" could make such a wonderful and imaginative film.

I'd liked bits and pieces, the puppets  and John Malkovich himself, but I found a lot of the other characters not  likable, especially the Cusack, Diaz and Keenar ones.  I waited two months  and then recently saw it again, this time alone.  It was much improved for  me on this second viewing.  Perhaps being prepared to not like the leads  helped me.  This time, I felt you weren't supposed to particularly like  them, especially Keenar and Cusack.

The puppets and puppeteering were  still magnificent; John Malkovich himself was a howl; some bit parts were  very funny, such as the lecherous Orson Bean and the sexually carnivorous  Charlie Sheen, playing himself. The idea itself, of being inside John  Malkovich for fifteen minutes at a time, before being hurled out of him and  onto the New Jersey roadside, was original and brilliant. I really don't  know whether this should be 4 stars or 5 stars.  I guess the fact that some  of you might find three lead characters not likable throughout the movie  makes me keep it down to a 4 as a caution.

1076879,4,630580706X,"Maaan... This is one of the coolest films I've ever seen.
The idea of discovering  a portal or gateway into an actor' s inside is interesting and  , at the same time, risky ( at least for the project investors ) too. But  when such a project is in the good hands of Spike Jonze and Charlie' s, the  results are bizarrely entertaining and somehow  thought-provoking.
Synopsis: The miserable puppeteer / loser Craig  Schwartz, urged by his animal-loving wife Lotte, decides to find a job and  ends up working as a document filer for a company on a central business  district office building 7 and 1/2 th floor, which every time you get the  elavator opened, if it' s opened at all, alarms go off, where  floor-to-ceiling height is about  a little less or more 1.30 centimetres.  There, he finds himself have a huge crush on a well-dressed, shrewd and  cunning colleague Maxine who often treats him like a loser, and, above all,  also finds himself, by accident, a gateway to get into one of the  20th-century finest actors John Malkovich's inside for a big while.
One  of 1999' s glorious achievements in terms of creativity, direction,  screenplay, cast performances and scores, Being John Malkovich provokes a  string of philosophical and metaphysical ideas of existence and immortality  in such a bizarrely interesting way, and in a way, is one of the most  creative stories of 1999.
Spike Jonze, with this film, puts himself on  the centre stage where his future piece of work would be eagerly looked  forward to.
Interesting Questions: 1) If you were offered a chance to be  inside of someone else of your interests to observe his private and  professional activities from his very own eyes for 20 minutes or so , just  for fun, would you  pretend not to give a fig about others' relished value  of privacy and go for it? ; 2) If you were offered  a chance to be able to  "" control "" his mind, would you go for it ?; and 3) If getting into his  very own mind and / or body means lingering on in this given world  for.....e-v-e-r, would you honestly do it ? A beat......... Now imagine your  answers are all put into real practice......yet by t-h-a-t particular  person...unto.....y-o-u !

Then  too, there's Spike Jonze's direction -- off just a shnoop (to quote  Chico)...IN EVERY SCENE.  What should be funny is either thrown away or,  more often, belabored beyond even a smile.

1076883,5,630580706X,"Craig Schwartz (played by actor John Cusack) has a problem: he doesn't like being Craig Schwartz.  This identity crisis is identified (pun  intended) immediately within the beautiful establishing shot(s) of director  Spike Jonze's fantastic -- if not highly bizarre -- film ""Being John  Malkovich.""  In the aforementioned shot(s) we see a puppet show taking  place -- a solitary performance, which is orchestrated and conducted by  Schwartz, with no audience in attendance and (presumably) with no other  purpose than providing him with a mode of escape: from himself, from his  life... from reality.  ""The grass is always greener on the other side of  the fence"" proves to be the running theme (or should I say  ""belief?"") for all the characters in the movie (including  Schwartz), each seeking a new and improved existence -- specifically via a  magical portal that allows them to enter the mind of acclaimed American  actor John Malkovich.  But once the transition is made, and each character  has a chance to ""be"" somebody else-to experience the hoped -- for  improved emerald splendor of another's grass -- Spike Jonze throws a wicked  curveball at the audience, asking the question ""Is it really greener  elsewhere?""
For me, this ingenious film worked on many levels.  Firstly, the technical aspects, from lighting to camera angles, and  everything in between, were handled and produced in a very controlled and  (I think) appropriate fashion for the message being conveyed.  An example  of this can be found in the choices of lighting for the scenes involving  Schwartz.  He's a man who has grown despondent with his life, so Jonze  chooses to light him in a gloomy, almost haze-like manner, conveying a  sense of doom and depression, as well as depicting a gloomy and futile  attempt by Schwartz to struggle through the suffocating miasma that  surrounds him every day.  It is not until we see Schwartz manipulating his  puppets, or until he enters the mind of Malkovich (essentially, in both  cases, ""becoming"" someone or something else), that we see a  brighter, more illuminating style of lighting used, which seems to indicate  Schwartz only feels alive and free when he is able to escape from himself.  This clever handling of the lighting shows the audience -- with or without  the assistance of related dialogue -- what kind of life Schwartz lives, and  gives definite clues to his personality and his motivation (or lack  thereof).
On the emotional and psychological levels, I found ""Being  John Malkovich"" to be extremely satisfying.  Not only was the  quirkiness of its subject matter both challenging and refreshing (I mean, a  magic portal into the mind of John Malkovich, for Pete's sake!), but the  underlying questions being asked, as well, made this a pleasurable viewing  experience.  I left the movie wondering about my own existence, and about  the times I -- like everyone else, I'm sure -- have considered what it  would be like to be someone else; to see the world through another's eyes.  The answer, I believe (and the movie provides this quite clearly), is that  a person can never really know what it's like be someone else without  completely becoming that other person.  And once you do, what's the point?  You've lost yourself and will never know the differences you are now  experiencing.

1076903,5,630580706X,"""Being John Malkovich"" is a revelation.  Of course this movie  isn't loved by all; but such gems that jumpstart a new wave of creativity  rarely reach universal popularity.  The first thing I thought of when I  heard about this movie was ""Anything this off the wall has to be  good.""  The second thing I thought was ""Hey!  I didn't know we  could do that.""  I mean, what a startling idea.  This movie really  pioneers a new genre: I call it ""reali-fantasy.""  People  steer away from this film because they find it too bizarre.  But the sad  truth is that the oddities in this film are just warped fun house mirrors  to our own lives.  Afterall, the only happy, sucessful character in this  film is Maxine; a cold, calculating, me-first-screw-everybody-else type.  The honest people just striving for their dreams are miserable.  Craig  wants to be a successful puppetteer.  Lottie simply wants to be a mother.  It is apparent that they will not be reaching these goals at the outset of  the film.
  Doesn't that just ring a little too true?
  How do they distract themselves?  Why, by becoming John Malkovich.  This  says another thing about our society; to distract ourselves from our  miserable lives we focus on celebrities.  We use them up, and when we are  done with them, leave them on the side of the road.
  This film is at  one moment utterly hilarious and all too depressing the next.  It truly is  a rollercoaster.  But with a story this enthralling, it is a ride you are  more than willing to take.
  John Malkovich delivers the greatest  performance of his career.  He doesn't only play John Malkovich, he also  plays the other characters that enter his mind so believably that you have  no problem believing that Craig Schwarftz is really controlling.
  John Cusack seems top be the only performer who didn't get any publicity  for this film.  That is really sad because his performance is so sublime  and strong.  After all, he is the sun of this film's universe.  If he  weren't as bright as he is the others would fall into despair apart.
  ""Being John Malkovich"" is a new film for the new millenium.  It  is perfect frame by frame.  I reccomend this film for everyone.  At least  try it.

Entire cans of alphabet soup have been spilled trying to describe  and praise the movie. Let me just praise the DVD. First of all, it contains  the movie. Always a good thing.

1076924,5,630580706X,"This movie is very funny, and as importantly, very original. Spike Jonze's directorial humor is perfectly aligned with the script, and he pulls off even the most challenging scenes successfully.
Likewise, the actors are  also up to the task of being believable or sympathetic in the midst of all  the absurdity. As almost everyone knows, this movie is about a character  finding a portal into John Malkovich's brain, and it takes a lot of skill  on the part of everyone involved in the film to make the movie as good as  its premise.
John Cusack is great as the down-on-his-luck puppeteer who  goes to work for a bureaucratic company whose most distinguishing  characteristic is its location on the half-height  ""seventh-and-a-half"" floor, where everyone has to stoop  over.
Catherine Keener is also excellent as Cusack's foil, a hard-nosed  opportunist who tempts Cusack away from his wife (an unrecognizable Cameron  Diaz) and stops at nothing to realize her own fantasies.
The film is  filled with metaphor, but is rarely heavy-handed. The chief metaphor  involves Cusack's roll as a puppeteer, whether with marionettes, or the  body of Malkovich. It turns out that almost every character wants to  manipulate another character to achieve his or her own goals.
Director  Jonze does a nice job of intertwining the visually fantastic (the portal to  Malkovich, the 7 1/2 floor, etc) with the utterly real (the New Jersey  Turnpike, Cusack's street corner puppet box), so you never get too far  removed from the reality of the characters' relationships with each other.  In other words, Jonze creates a fantastic world but keeps you connected to  the people who live in it.
Jonze's best moments come near the end of the  film, which I'll try not to spoil -- one involves a flash back sequence of  an animal, and the other involves two characters travelling through a third  character's memories. As far as I know, nothing like it has ever been done  on film before, and both are done with a sense of humor that belies their  genius.
This movie is one of three or four in 1999 that I think will be  remembered for changing the direction of film away from all the ""Pulp  Fiction"" knock-offs that dominated the late nineties. The success of  movies like this, hopefully, will encourage film makers to have a bit more  confidence in their audiences.
The disc has several extras, though it  lacks a commentary track (which would have been the icing on the cake). Two  of the extras are extended segments of programs that appeared on television  within the film. (In other words, a TV in the movie was showing something.  These extras are full-sized, full length versions of what the TV was  showing...A similar thing is done on the Criterion Silence of the Lambs  DVD). Another extra is a 20-minute or so exploration of the puppeteer  ""pulling the strings"" behind the scenes of the film. It serves as  a good introduction to a field of entertainment you probably haven't given  a lot of thought to lately.
Another extra is a brief, parodic interview  with the director while he's driving his car. It's a good for a laugh or  two, though he (purposely) doesn't offer much insight into the film. One  other extra feature is footage of an extra who had to drive her car in the  background of a shot on the NJ Turnpike, along with a couple of dozen other  extras. It's shot with a shaky camcorder by, and is entertaining because  the girl is really funny, although, again, it doesn't really tell you much  about how this movie (or any other movie) is made.
Finally, there is a  brief segment of a guy with a camcorder (the same guy who did the other two  extras) interviewing ""aspiring puppeteers"" about the movie at  it's premiere in LA. Very brief, and will make you laugh once.
The sound  and video quality are fine. The movie does not have a particularly  demanding soundtrack.
All in all, this is a great movie, one which will  probably be considered somewhat significant a few years from now, and the  extras on the DVD are good, though not great.",964742400,3,4044,4.752161383285302
1076925,3,630580706X,"Didn't everyone get so excited when this was released at the movies? - what a unique film, so different from all the other guff out there, one that makes you think and sends its director's profile into the  stratosphere.
It's probably worthwhile now to give it a second look and  see if it does stand up - wait for it - it's not bad but hardly the classic  it has been made out to be. Warning - Spike Jonze is not the saviour of  American cinema on the evidence of this film. I know this won't endear me  to those people who love the film and have been waiting for this second  coming (those same people who lauded a certain Mr Tarantino until he came  out with his segment of ""Four Rooms"") but while it does have some  nice touches it does have many drawbacks.
So let's get the bad stuff out  of the way - it's way too long and the sub-plot with the wrinklies doesn't  work - a bid to add some excitement to the film. I'm sorry but Cameron Diaz  in that fright wig doesn't work either. I am a huge fan of Ms Diaz's work  but this isn't her best. The streak of misogny doesn't help the film  either, and this isn't just being politically correct. While Ms Diaz does  deserve to be told off for that wig, locking her in a cage goes way  overboard. Finally John Cusack just really gets on your nerves - I just  wanted to give him a slap.
Now for the good - and despite what I have  said there is still some - John Malkovitch for example. He sends himself up  superbly and anyone that has an image of him as a surly actor will surely  have their opinion changed. The scene where he enters his own head is  inspired and this gives me hope that Mr Jonze does have a future.  Malkovitch surely deserved a nod at the Oscars but the Academy probably got  confused - nominate a man for playing himself, for goodness sake? However  Catherine Keener did get a nomination and I just hope more of the  movie-going public discover this wonderful actress.
So there you have it  - a film that has been hyped to the gills, does contain a few excellent  touches in what one hopes is a successful career for Mr Jonze. But the  greatest film of the last year.....I think not!",964656000,,2155,4.205378973105135

Even if  it ultimately serves little purpose beyond the thrill of comedic invention,  this demented romance is gloriously entertaining, spilling over with ideas  that tickle the brain and even touch the heart. That's to be expected in a  movie that dares to ponder the existential dilemma of a forlorn puppeteer  (John Cusack) who discovers a metaphysical portal into the brain of actor  John Malkovich.
  The puppeteer's working as a file clerk on the  seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan office building; this idea alone  might serve as the comedic basis for an entire film, but Jonze and Kaufman  are just getting started. Add a devious coworker (Catherine Keener),  Cusack's dowdy wife (a barely recognizable Cameron Diaz), and a business  scheme to capitalize on the thrill of being John Malkovich, and you've got  a movie that just gets crazier as it plays by its own outrageous rules.  Malkovich himself is the film's pice de rsistance, riffing on his own  persona with obvious delight and--when he enters his own brain via the  portal--appearing with multiple versions of himself in a tour-de-force use  of digital trickery.

1076929,4,630580706X,"`Being John Malkovich' certainly ranks among the most brilliantly conceived and executed films of the past several years. Overflowing with imagination and creativity, it manages to breathe new life into that  trickiest of cinematic genres - the surrealist satire. Like all films that  dare to take risks, `Being John Malkovich' sometimes stumbles in the paths  it chooses to take, but at least its course is always an innovative and  fascinating one.
John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a soft-spoken  nebbish leading a life less of quiet desperation than of overwhelming  blandness. Unable to support himself as a puppeteer, he finally succumbs to  his wife's pressure to seek out a job, landing a position as file clerk in  a bizarre company located on the 7  th floor of a Manhattan office  building. One of the triumphs of the film is that it portrays the surreal  in such an understated and quiet way. This floor has ceilings so low that  the people who work on it must continually crouch as they move about their  business, yet they all accept that fact with an uncomplaining and  unquestioning good humor. Even when Schwartz discovers a strange portal  hidden behind some cabinets leading directly into John Malkovich's brain,  all those to whom Craig reveals his secret take very little convincing both  to believe him and to experiment with it themselves. Thus, by creating a  world that already appears slightly askew in its reality - Craig's wife, in  addition, runs a pet shop and therefore fills their house with a menagerie  of exotic animals -the film makes it possible for us to go along with the  characters' otherwise inexplicably blas reactions.
Writer Charlie  Kaufman and director Spike Jonze hit upon a number of fascinating themes in  the course of their bizarre musings. Craig, for instance, learns that there  exists a certain safety in the tediousness of everyday life, for the moment  he allows the extraordinary to enter his ordered world he unleashes  passions - that have been long dormant both in himself and his wife - which  he finds himself unable to control. His wife, in particular, whom he has  mistakenly pigeonholed as a woman concerned only with the humdrum  domesticities associated with married life, provides him with a rude  awakening as she begins to surpass him in her burgeoning obsession with  experiencing the excitements of sexual liberation. Craig also discovers the  terrifying truth about himself, that, beneath the faade of a meek,  mild-mannered artist there lurks the soul of a repressed despot, as he  comes more and more to relish the ability to move into Malkovich's mind and  control his thoughts and actions - much as with his beloved puppets, but  now on a much more grand, much more malevolent scale. The film generates  much of its comic tension through the complex sexual interplay that  develops among Craig, his wife, Lotte, and his alluring but enigmatic  co-worker, Maxine, in whom both husband and wife develop a more than  passing sexual interest. With tinges of `No Exit,' the three characters  find themselves caught in a frustrating world of overlapping and therefore  clashing sexual desires and passions.
The film demonstrates a real stroke  of genius in its casting. John Cusack, with his look of understated  bewilderment, perfectly conveys the soul of a man too long accustomed to  expecting little in the way of surprise out of life. Catherine Keener  brilliantly captures the detached cynicism and taunting coolness that makes  her such an enthralling sexual temptation to both Craig and Lotte. And  whose audacious decision was it to cast Cameron Diaz as the near-dowdy  second fiddle to Kenner, to make her the NON-sex object in the film? As for  Mr. Malkovich himself, he seems to be having the self-deprecating time of  his life as he allows himself and even his lack of general public name  recognition to become targets for gentle ribbing.
`Being John Malkovich'  is not a perfect movie. It occasionally sags in places and suffers from  some repetition and, like many utterly original and audacious works, it  sometimes alienates its audience through its quality of often-cold  calculation. At moments in which the iconoclasm seems to become an end in  itself, one may be tempted to see the film in emperor's-new-clothes terms,  wondering if what one is seeing is really as brilliant as it appears or  just an intellectual scam being played on a self-congratulatory elite  audience. For the most part, however, `Being John Malkovich' is fertile  enough in its invention and varied enough in its imaginativeness to rate as  a film well worth seeing and cherishing. There should definitely be more  like it!",964310400,,4693,5.03780964797914

 In this case, I sided with those who thought it was  brilliant. At times, during the beginning I thought I was in front of a  version of the exceptional movie ""Brazil,"" but I was proved  wrong. In fact, I'd dare to say that this movie is just as good (if not  better than Brazil).
 A production has to be brilliant in order to allow  you to laugh through some of the delicate topics this movie addresses.
  Some of the brilliant points of the movie: the 7 1/2 floor (yes,  seven-and-a-half!); the tunnel leading into JM's head; making Cameron Diaz  look so odd; John Cusack evolving throughout the movie from an innocent and  hermit puppeteer into an animal obsessed with obtaining what somebody else  has...
 It touches original terrain, unlike any other movie I've seen in  a long time. Guaranteed to make you think while having a GREAT laugh!  (weird ain't it?) ;)",963964800,,1029,4.481081081081081
1076931,3,630580706X,"First, a note of explanation on the title to this review: it is my impression that we live in something of a dark age of filmmaking, in which the merely mediocre is exalted as ""original"" and ""compelling."" That is not to say that ""Being John Malkovich"" is simply mediocre, but rather that it isn't nearly as ""great"" as the critics' cavalcade (or most of the reviews on this site) might lead you to believe. It is nevertheless worthwhile.
To begin, the central gimmick is that a small, hidden doorway on the 7 1/2th floor of a New York City highrise leads to a portal to the brain, or the consciousness, of John Malkovich, and that after fifteen minutes (or more, for one possessing the John Cusack character's puppeteering skills) spits the subject out somewhere on the side of the New Jersey turnpike. The geography is meaningless (and I have to ask, just how does Cusack's character manage to make it from NYC to the NJ Turnpike in under 15 minutes when he needs to pick somebody up?), but it shouldn't be hard to see the possibilities inherent in the concept--they are, after all, touted in the ad copy for the film and in most of the glowing reviews (""screwball comedy, a meditation on the nature of existence, of the soul"" blah blah blah).
Few of those possibilities are realized. Rather than a heady stew on the nature of existence, the eventual explanation for the portal is more like a thin gruel of possession and transference in a quest for immortality. To be fair, the questions are posed by some of the characters, but they are never really addressed by the film itself, except in a fashion as superficial as the characters themselves. As for these characters, with the exception of Malkovich himself (and there mostly by way of pathos) there is no one deserving of sympathy or empathy.
The movie succeeds best as a very black sort of comedy--if you enjoy the spectacle of uniformly reprehensible characters enacting a series of escapades winding down to an ending with no sense of justice, of anyone getting their due (and I often do), you might enjoy this film.
One final postscript: some sort of award should be due John Malkovich, who--regardless of the truth or falsity of the aspects of his life ""revealed"" in this film--exposes himself to an enormous potential for ridicule here. More minor kudos to Cameron Diaz, who--in what passes for courage among Hollywood A-list actors and actresses--is difficult to recognize as something other than the blonde smile on sticks she's been in her other films. Final kudos to whoever came up with the idea of high-concept puppetry as a public-TV-pledge-week fad in the same vein as ""Riverdance,"" which was hilarious.",963964800,,2672,4.785714285714286
1076966,5,630580706X,"Being John Malkovich is a masterpiece. Not only is it the definite best movie I have ever watched over and over, but it is also just a twisted piece of film. Spike Jonze was already my favorite music video director,  and now he is my favorite director, period. He is inventive, strange,  scary, and he makes you think. Malkovich tells a very twisted story. It's  about a puppeteer (John Cusack) who can never get payed because people  don't understand his shows. His pet freak wife (Cameron Diaz) lives with  him and supports him. He begins looking for work elsewhere eventually. He  looks in the newspaper and finds a filing job on the 7 1/2th floor of a  skyscraper downtown. There he meets his beautiful office-mate (Catherine  Keener) and his adventures begin. He finds a secret door leading to a  tunnel into John Malkovich's (John Malkovich) brain and devises a plan to  sell tickets to visit his world. Although there are various sub plots and  sub meanings, the basic point of this film is the fact that we are afraid  to be ourselves so we will do anything we can to be someone else. It's  about moving on with life and falling down when it falls down. The DVD is  great, the film is amazing, and it is a must see for everyone into odd  films.

It is easily the best movie of 1999, and fully deserved its three Oscar nominations. John Cusack  is well cast as a struggling puppeteer whose life takes a strange turn when  he discovers a hidden door in his office. Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz  also put in fine performances. John Malkovich has a tough role to play but  pulls it off with conviction. If you are expecting a laugh-a-minute comedy  then this movie probably isn't for you. Although it has it's funny moments,  these are subtly played - like Cusack applying for a filing job on the  seven and a halfth floor, which has rather low ceilings (low overheads you  see, so the savings can be passed onto the customer...).  The overall  premise is pure fantasy and requires suspension of disbelief but if you are  prepared to go along with it, this movie is well worth seeing. It is very  thought-provoking. Finding a category for this movie would be a tough job,  but the best I can come up with is 'bizarre existentialist philosophical  comedy' (but don't let that put you off...). The DVD itself is very good.  Excellent picture and sound, and some extras although these are of  questionable quality. The 'interview' with director Spike Jonze is quite  frankly baffling. It takes place in a moving car and he ends up getting out  and vomiting. Whatever.  So, I wholeheartedly recommend this. It easily  slots into my top 10 movies.

His sexy, tempestuous co-worker played by Catherine Keener is along  for the ride, and his wife (Cameron Diaz) is involved with both. Then there  is Schwartz's boss (Orson Bean) who also has a special interest in  Malkovich.
The idea behind this film is brilliant, but the most fun of  all comes from watching Malkovich himself endure this bizarre situation.  The cast and the special effects are the two best features of this film,  and Malkovich should win some type of award for being such a good sport.  Unfortunately, the story sputters a little near the end, but for its  originality and bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing.

Now, to me, 1999 was one of those great years in cinema. It was just marvellous. Most years you  wouldn't argue with American Beauty winning everything (not that that  REALLY matters). But in 1999. NO!  NO DAMN WAY!  So, it should have been  Malkovich then? Well, no. Over American Beauty, yeah! But sadly Spike Jonze  couldn't quite give us the best film of the year. But he was so close.  Explaining the plot of Malkovich would be pointless, but I think that  describing the plot of any mvie is stupid. You're supposed to watch the  damn thing to find out what's happening. But, any rate.

Coupled with a good cast, the possibilities for  a riveting and funny story abounded. But this movie doesn't carry it  off.
Watching John Malkovich play himself is probably the best part of  the film. John Cusack plays an unhappily married (to Cameron Diaz) pupeteer  obsessed with an attractive coworker with whom he partners to sell trips  into the mind of John Malkovich for $200 each.
There are some excellent  pupeteering scenes in the film that are enchanting. There are a few laughs  in places, but this is not a side-splitting comedy. The story takes time to  build. We're almost a third of the way through the film before we have our  first encounter with Mr. Malkovich.
After this first visit, the story  meanders and plots within subplots appear with the pupeteers wife having a  love affair with the attractive coworker while she occupies John  Malkovich's body. Sounds confusing? It is a little.
As the film moves  into the second half, it picks up pace, but it feels rushed. The novelty of  watching John Malkovich play himself wears off and a brief appearance by  Charlie Sheen (also playing himself) does nothing to improve the film.
My  advice would be to rent the movie before buying. It's worth watching, in  places, but not if you've got something better to do. I think most people  can happily wait until it appears on TV.",963532800,4,1519,4.754789272030651

1076974,5,630580706X,"Writer Charlie Kaufman, director Spike Jonze and a superb cast team up to deliver one of the most original, highly imaginative and clever films to come our way in a long time:  ""Being John Malkovich,"" starring John Cusack,  Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich is the story of  out-of-work puppeteer Craig Schwartz (Cusack), who has a real talent for  manipulating the strings of his marionettes, but unfortunately, his is a  vocation not exactly in demand.  And when he has to take a temporary job to  support his wife, Lotte (Diaz), it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude  that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm  beyond the known.  Soon the question is, who is really pulling and  controlling the strings of whom?  Jonze has taken Kaufman's unique  screenplay, which is witty, humorous and totally engrossing, and made an  ingenious movie; in fact, there's never been anything quite like it.  It is  distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor, sometimes dark,  sometimes hilarious, but riveting throughout.  And the performances are  absolutely first rate all around.  Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for  Best Supporting Actress, but Cusack, Diaz and Malkovich are also exemplary  here.  Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done;  there's an edgy, quiet intelligence to Craig, a Bohemian at heart, who is  reserved, generally takes things as they come, and exudes a certain boyish  charm.  He also has an apartment full of pets (snakes, birds and a chimp).  Diaz, taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, is terrific as Lotte, who is  somewhat unremarkable and works as a pet shop clerk.  It's a great  character part, and Diaz plays it for all it's worth, connecting with the  audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed  yearnings.  Malkovich (as himself) is the icing on the cake; he plays it  straight, with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable  somehow credible, while lending an easy, natural flow to the innate humor  of the story.  The ""Malkovich, Malkovich,"" sequence, and his rendition of  the ""puppet's dance"" are unforgettable scenes.  But character actor Orson  Bean (with his creation of the wry Dr. Lester), nearly steals the show with  a truly memorable performance; the scene in which he interviews  job-applicant Craig is classic.  The supporting cast includes Mary  Kay Place (absolutely hysterical as Floris), Charlie Sheen (Charlie),  Carlos Jacott (Larry), Willie Garson (Guy in restaurant) and Byrne Piven  (Captain Mertin).  ""Being John Malkovich"" is a movie that is an experience  in itself, and Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation  for bringing this one to life, for making it breathe.

The central conceit is clever and original, but the genius of the movie is that dizzying variations on the idea are worked smoothly into the plot and  used to reveal the devices and desires of the characters.
The choice of  John Malkovich as the MacGuffin is, in retrospect, obvious.  It is hard to  imagine another actor with a public image that would work so well (consider  BEING BURT REYNOLDS).  The entire cast does a suberb job, and even Charlie  Sheen appears in a rare non-gratuitous cameo.
Despite many comic moments,  this is a fundamentally tragic movie, reminiscent at points of the work of  Robert Aickman.  Desire, here, is a vacuum and personality is a deadly  trap.  ""Consider the metaphysical implications!"" says one;  ""We could charge $200 a head,"" answers another.  Simple greed  appears healthy when compared to the grasping for control and immortality  that wins the day.  The redemption offered to a few characters by love is  anything but the typical tidy Hollywood escape (no one even gets to  ""die for love."")

While mind switching and occupation may not be the freshest  idea out there, the direction this movie goes is so original it's scary.  But it works.  Both disturbing and entertaining, this movie succeeds on so  many levels.
First, the bizarre rules.  Cusack lives in a bizarre world  populated with bizarre people that drive the story along.  He is subjected  to the absurd until he finds a way to escape.  I don't want to say much  else, because it might ruin the movie.  Suffice to say that there is a way  to be in John Malkovich's mind, but to do so you must end up along side of  the New Jersey Turnpike.

This film directed by Spike Jonze. tells the tale of a burnout puppeteer Craig Schwartz(John  Cusack) whose wife Lotti(Cameron Diaz) urges him to get a job. Craig finds  a job and goes to the interview in an office building on the 9 1/2 floor.  He gets the job and finds a love named Maxine(Catherine Keener) ,who  rejects him, and a portal that lets you be John Malkovich(Played by none  other than... John Malkovich) for 15 minutes.
The Being John Malkovich  DVD is very unique, mainly because of the contributions by the film's  director Spike Jonze. Jonze has added two of his own small documentries,  much like ""An Intimate Look at Acting With Ice Cube"" on the Three  Kings DVD. One of these documentries is on puppeteering and the other is on  background driving. Both are very amusing. There is also an interview with  Spike Jonze that has a very Andy Kaufman-like conclusion. There are also  four trailers which are very amusing. This is a must-have for any fan of  the film, or of absurdist comedy.",962236800,,1133,4.661616161616162

1077083,3,630580706X,"I had heard so much about this film and i was an admirer of Spike Jonze's music videos, Sabotage, And Praise you by Fatboy Slim, i thought were both hilarious.  So i was expecting a bit of the same, and defintely received  it.  The beginning of the film is hilarious, the speech impediment  secretary i thought was great, and the 7.5 floor was hilarious as well.  The other amazing things to this film was the puppeteering, incredible, i  never knew it could be so artistic.  And of course when he discovers the  portal for the first time, and is thrown out on the new jersey turnpike.  I  was gripped, ready for a good funny film.  Unfortunately i was disappointed  because the film became too serious and intellectual, with the women posing  as vicarious lesbians through malkovich, and relating through someone else.  I don't know i found it a bit too depressing, when i thought it could have  been really funny and quirky, ala Gilliam.  The other thing that bothered  me was the logic of the portals, the Dr. ""found"" a portal and has  been living in a portal to extend his life, and has brought some friends  along to live in Malkovich, which i didn't really understand...Can more  than one person live in a person?  And then the notion that you will be  trapped in a childs mind if you don't get into the portal confused me as  well, because i was wondering, okay you are confined to look through a  child's eyes, but you have no power over the child, but in Malkovich you  possess him? and have power over him?,...gotta a little lost on some of the  logic here...was a bit too confusing.  As far as originality it was a great  film, amazing concept, but the turns of the storyline just bugged and  depressed me.  And i'm not afraid of stranger films, one of my fav is Time  Bandits but this film just didn't go in a direction that appealed to me, it  lacked fun.",961545600,,1868,4.451038575667655
1077084,4,630580706X,"I don't think I've ever seen a film get so MPD a reaction from those in the theater. Not that some loved it and some hated it... but the same person would come out with both reactions in the space of a sentence. That's phenomenal power, people. That's what filmmaking at its best is all  about-- the ability to elucidate and confuse at the same time. And the best  part, the true knock on Hollywood? That an indie film company stocked  with rock and roll stars made this sucker on a shoestring with the kinds of  starpower normally reserved for Hollywood's biggest nine-figure  blockbusters and it's still been one of the nation's top ten films every  week since the listening public discovered it. I know people who've seen  this as many times as they've seen Rocky Horror. I figured it was time.  (And I had free passes and couldn't use them to see Toy Story 2.)

It's hard to say word one about this movie without giving away major  pleasant surprises. Everyone knows, of course, that Malkovich plays himself  (and hams it up tremedously), and most people are aware that the male lead  is John Cusack. The rest of the film's cast is a mystery, I think. It was  to me, anyway. And when they popped the name of the female lead up on the  screen, not only had I not recognized her throughout the movie, but I tried  to figure out who she played... and I got it wrong. Wow. Suffice to say the  casting is stellar, you know almost everyone, and they had to have worked  for scale. And they're all brilliant.

One extra little sidelight--  the puppeteering in this movie is tremendous. If you go in for avant-garde  productions and all that sort of stuff, the incredible complexity of the  marionette shows at various times during this film will astound you. The  puppeteer's name was flashed at the end, but I missed it. Remember this  guy, if and when you see this movie, 'cause if anyone ever makes it big in  marionettes, it'll be him.

The plot is, um, simple-- an out-of-work  puppeteer (Cusack) gets a job as a filing clerk, falls in love with a  co-worker (he's married and they're on the verge of on-the-rocks) who snubs  him repeatedly, and discovers in his office a door that opens into a portal  which allows the person entering it to get inside the head of John  Malkovich (portrayed by himself) for fifteen minutes. After being voided  from Malkovich, one is unceremoniously dumped into a ditch on the New  Jersey Turnpike-- a beautiful metaphor if I've ever seen one. The plot  can't get any more twisted? Hold your tongue! Of course, I can't _tell_ you  more about it without giving it away... you just gotta go.

The film  was produced by R. E. M. vocalist Michael Stipe and is the full-length  directorial debut of music video guru Spike Jonze, perhaps best known for  his longtime association with the Beastie Boys. Whatever you may think of  their music, you have to admit, their videos are always something new and  unexpected. As is this film. It's twisted, it's mean, it's ugly, at times  it's funny as hell. It's two hours of sheer, utter, complete enjoyment...  but you walk out feeling guilty for having enjoyed it as much as you did.  Go. See it now. Laugh. Everyone else will feel more guilty about it than  you will.",961286400,2,3242,4.563478260869565

1077086,5,630580706X,"I went in to this film not really knowing what I was going to see, I came out not really knowing what I had seen.  All I know is that this was one of the most original, artistic and maybe even one of the most beautiful films  that I have ever seen. From the moment the opening credits have finished  their duty, you are thrown into the  surreal world of Craig Shwartz an out  of work puppet master, shunned by a society who no longer appreciate his  forgotten art.  Money is tight and Craig is forced to find work beyond the  realms of puppetry, his skilfull hands make him the perfect candidate for a  postition as a filing clerk.  His new work place is located on the 7 1/2  floor of a tower building.  This is when surreal makes way for the outright  bizarre and the movie begins to reveal its real charm.
The 7 1/2 floor  is located between the 7th and 8th floor and is half the height of the  other floors. A  series of events (the finding of a door which leads in to  John Malkovich's mind is just one of many) follow which all culminate to  make wonderful entertainment which is way superior in intelligence to the  normal churn of Hollwood movies.  Don't get me wrong I am a great fan of  all types of movies and Art House style films aren't usually my kind'a  thing that is what is so surprising about this movie, it is there for  everybody to enjoy. It is non conformist, I can't decide what genre this  is, but maybe that is why it is so appealing.  It offers something so  different that everybody who sees it at least enjoys its uniqueness.
I  don't want to reveal too much about the film because not knowing only makes  this film better.  I will say though that the cast are brilliant. John  Cusack is outstanding in his role as Shwartz, and Cameron Diaz is hilarious  as his wife, believe me you have never seen Diaz like this before.  Catherine Keener plays Maxine, and is brilliant in the role of a vixen  seductress.  But the real hero here is Spike Jonze the director, he keeps  the film flowing and gives it continuity which must have been a very  complex task.  And, oh yes I also said that the film was beautiful, this  has largely to do with the use of some wonderful puppetry.  It is used on  various occasions to parody the emotions of Shwartz, and gives a better  understanding to what the film is trying to achieve.
The Dvd presentation  is somewhat dissapointing for a movie that begs so much more. Many of the  extras which it promises on the dvd sleeve are no more than highlights from  the film.  There is however a short, but insightful, interview with the man  behind the puppetry.  I hope that someday a more comprehensive release such  as a criterion edition will be released.  But for now we simply have to  make do with one of the most intriguing and involving films of our time.  Enjoy",961113600,,2823,4.342967244701349

Which seems, from some of these reviews, to be a good thing. I wound up watching it twice, once alone and once with my  wife. Both times it went along swiftly and did not drag ... so much for  those criticisms. There's just enough inventiveness in this movie to keep  it going, and yet avoid collapsing on itself. A lot of the credit for that,  I think, goes to the actors. In the wrong hands the characters could easily  come across as stereotypes or weird for their own sake, but Diaz, Cusack  and Keener especially pull through. The script, too, knows when to shift  gears, particularly from the parodistic humor of the orientation video (a  really dead-on spoof, mirrored at the end by the A&E documentary spoof  - perfect!) to the Office Space-style workplace cynicism, to my favorite  moment in the film: Diaz and Cusack both jump on Keener at the same time.  The ride through Malkovich's subconscious is also deranged, but there have  been similar sequences in other movies. I don't see the film as a  commentary on celebrity since Malkovich isn't (one of the running jokes) as  well-known and recognized as, say, Bruce Willis would be. I think the  producers were exploring existential themes, but the main flaw of the movie  is they do too much exploring and not enough concluding. Issues are raised  but never really much more than that. Still, the ending is haunting ...  Craig, a pathetic ... really, willing to spend another lifetime  watching his lover through the eyes of her daughter, and then the surreal  shots of Emily splashing around in the water with that weird Bjork music.

1077129,4,630580706X,"Spike Jonze's debut is one of those strange little unclassifiable movies that come along once in a while. A beautifully surreal, black comedy that plays its increasingly bizarre premise straight-faced. And surely, a  contender for the most original plot of all time.
Craig Schwartz is a  struggling street puppeteer who gains employment to help finance his  talents on the mysterious Floor 7 1/2 (with - quite literally - low  overheads). It is here, behind an office filing cabinet, he discovers a  strange portal that leads into (wait for it) the brain of John Malkovich  (playing himself). Out for a quick buck, discovering that whoever crawls  through the doorway becomes the eponymous actor for 15 minutes before being  unceremoniously ejected out onto the side of some New Jersey turnpike,  Schwartz devises the ultimate 'experience', selling trips into the actor's  head for $200. If this isn't weird enough, the plot convolutes further to  accommodate such elements as lesbian love trysts, love triangles (or rather  quadrangles), gender disorientation, chimpanzee childhood trauma flashbacks  and even Malkovich entering his own self
Malkovich's portrayal of his  private off-screen self is self-effacingly superb, and perhaps the bravest  performance to ever grace celluloid; at once, campy, effete, conceited. The  restaurant scene touches on genius.
As if Woody Allen (circa: The Purple  Rose of Cairo) had scripted the original Twilight Zone series, this is a  movie of equal parts comedy and tragedy. The dialogue is sharp, witty; the  deeply flawed characters, fully realised (if not identifiable), spiralling  out of control towards an inevitable but creepily effective  denouement.
Most of the film's power, however, derives from its realistic  approach to such a ludicrous idea. Its internal logic and cod-psychology  remain intact and wholly believable.
Being John Malkovich, although of  an acquired taste, is an undeniably unique and unpredictable voyage of  cinema fantasy. And for much less than $200.",960854400,5,2024,5.4935064935064934

However, the story meanderd aimlessly,  and at points I started to really dislike the pathetic characters that  evolved.  The ending was a classic ""anti-ending"", it left me  feeling cheated.

I  agree with another critic when he/she recommends sobriety while observing  this film.  You have to have sharp thinking skills to understand what is  going on, if understanding this film is even possible.
I like to think  that I have an active and creative imagination because some of my thoughts  have conjured strange looks from peers when I have shared them.  However,  this was a little extreme.  I didn't mind the ""ability"" to  observe life from Mr. Malkovich's mind.  I didn't even mind the lesbian  sub-plot.  I can even swallow needing a monkey as a subsitute for a real  child. But, I have to hit myself in the head while trying to comprehend the  ability of being able to take over a person's life in order to continue  life for infinity.
The acting was good, but I don't believe Mr.  Malkovich had to do very much acting.  Yes, there were scenes where he had  to dance and become angry, but he seemed much like himself when he played  Mr. Malkovich and when John Cusack's character invades him.  I believe the  best acting came from Cameron Diaz.  It takes alot to sleep in a cage with  a monkey.
DVD Special Features:  If you thought the movie was strange,  the special features take you a step higher.  I began to wonder if the  people involved were somehow ""tricked"" into believing that this  situation was real.

1077180,5,630580706X,"A few years back there was rare failure in the otherwise successful pairing of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (see, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail).  It was called, Joe Versus the Volcano.  That movie begins with  dreary, unpleasant characters in sort of dreary, sometimes bizarre  settings.  In Being John Malkovich, the main characters are sort of dreary  and a little unpleasant.  Cusack looks scruffy and he has a bit of a  personality disorder.  And, you will probably ask yourself or your  companion twice, ""Is that really Cameron Diaz?""  She looks so  incredibly unglamerous in this movie.
The difference between the two  films is that Being John Malkovich takes things just over the line and into  the realm of the funny.  In Joe, the dreariness was bad fluorescent  lighting in the office.  Being John Malkovich gives us the 7 1/2 floor of  the Mertin-Flemmer building, which is ""named after Captain Mertin and  as local legend has it, is also named for a man named Flemmer.""  There  is certainly something to the matter-of-fact way that people accept coming  onto a floor with 5 foot ceilings in the film.
At the same time, all of  the bizarre and largely unexplained events (for example, how do people  actual come to be John Malkovich?) are grounded in reality just enough for  you to be genuinely interested in what happens to the characters throughout  the film.  This isn't Brazil, or another over-the-top type of film.  This  is a story of flawed but genuine people who have their goals met or  frustrated in the context of a completely original premise.  The  unbelieveable situations are presented so matter of factly that you accept  it and move on-- a comment on modern life, no doubt.
Cusack and Diaz  are perfectly cast in this film.  We are used to seeing Cusack in good guy  role.  In Grosse Pointe Blank, for example, he made a murderer-for-hire as  likeable as the guy next door.  Here he plays against that by demonstrating  some remarkably non-John Cusack moments to full comedic effect.  Diaz plays  a plain and mousy woman in this film and this works for her, too.  Not to  forget Malkovich's performance, in which he plays himself and himself  occupied by another person!
The result is an excellent film that  works on many levels.  We aren't meant to ponder whether the events  depicted can actually happen.  Although, there is enough presented here to  launch a number of philosphical discussions.  The film is funny just taken  at face value.  The results when John Malkovich takes a turn being John  Malkovich are some of the most hilarious moments I've seen in a long time.  This film is both broadly funny and darkly funny and slyly funny and  over-the-top funny.  A completely original premise done in superbly  accurate and entertaining manner.
The DVD provides some interesting  special features, including clips that the characters watch on TV in the  movie.  The behind-the-scenes segments sort of reflect the moviemaker's  skewed view of the world, but the one segment about an extra whose job it  is to drive past the set on the highway is quite funny and very  interesting.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is good, too.  Overall, an excellent DVD to add to your library.",960249600,2,3233,4.834254143646409

The concept of being able to slide down a  physical portal to take up residence for 15 minutes behind the eyes of John  Malkovich makes the viewer wonder if this movie is some kind of allegory ...  but ultimately it boils down to a supernatural fantasy similar in some  respects to ""All of Me"" (Steve Martin, Lily Tomlin).

1077183,4,630580706X,"""Being John Malkovich"" is, indeed, an original film; an aspect  of films that can sometimes hurt them greatly. Many films have been made  that have been credited as original, and they have turned out to be simply  obtuse and offputting to their audience. But ""Being John  Malkovich"" allows its audience to wallow in its creativity.  ""Being John Malkovich"" is the kind of film you watch with a  cocked eyebrow the whole time, in which you find yourself enjoying the film  but you're not quite sure why.
The movie tells the story of a failing  puppeteer (John Cusack, who plays his role with such wit and genius that  you find yourself not even realizing he's there) who gets a job at a filing  company to pay the bills for him and his mop-top wife (Cameron Diaz,  unrecognizable and wonderful). There he finds a portal into the mind of  actor, John Malkovich. He then, along with his partner whom he has fallen  in love with (Catherine Keener, who you'll love to hate) starts a business,  selling trips to the subconcious of Malkovich to people having identity  crises.
Although the movie has its flaws (sometimes it's TOO odd for its  own good, and it doesn't have nearly enough laughs in it to be labled a  comedy) ""Being John Malkovich"" is so creative and is full of so  many witty ironies, that those flaws don't matter. You will love  ""Being John Malkovich."" Finally, a review for this movie wouldn't  be complete without mentioning John Malkovich, who appears as himself in  the movie. You can tell he enjoyed mocking himself while watching the  movie, and while the mocking is cute and clever, the makers of this film do  it subtly and don't overplay it, so to make it more than just a shameless  plug for John Malkovich.

John Cusack is great as the pathetic pupeteer,  and Cameron Diaz shows she can take good career risks with this unusual  role for her. But it is Catherine Keener and John Malkovich who give the  film is's flavor. Keener is the ultimate object of desire for everyone in  the film and she delivers very funny lines and gives the best performance  in the cast.

I was hooked from the opening scene.  Even though none of the actors are really even in it (major kudos to the puppeteering/design team...they make this film too.), it sets this weird  melancholic but frenzied-life tone to the flick that never stops.
The  acting in this film is superb.  One of the only movies out there where you  really do forget that you are watching people playing roles (the guy with  me kept forgetting that it was actually Cameron Diaz on screen-it's really  unbelieveable how disheveled the costume team made her).
The story is  really pretty simple, but the implications are immense.  Not only touching  on our own celebrity fascination, but also toying with the strange feeling  of ""What would it be like if...?"", _Being John Malkovich_ has a  lot to say about that ineffable ineptitude that so many of us are familiar  with.
The presence of all of the characters is breaktaking, simply  because all of their crazy and bizarre behaviours seem perfectly normal.  It's that Gilliam-esque mastery of the absurd; treat it as if it happens  every day.
_Being John Malkovich_ is fun, loony, and even a touch  philosophical.  Plus, you'll laugh until you cry.  And when was the last  time you saw John Malkovich in a red-sequined gown in all his bare-headed  glory?
But a warning.  This is a weird little movie.  It doesn't look  like an absurdist flick, but it really is.  I know that some people don't  like that.  This is definitely a ""Love it!"" or  ""What? "" kind of film.  If you need your movies to have  even-paced predictable plots and definitive endings or if you need  characters to behave in rational and real world ways, avoid this one.  This  is not a lark for those new to the world of film absurdity-the hard and  fast rules of blockbuster type films do not apply here.

A puppeteer finds a gateway into John Malkovich's head on the 7.5th floor of his office building? The film deserves an award just for the industrial-strength suspension of belief it achieves. Now, the gist: 1. Acting rocks, uniformly. Whoever did the pupeteering for J. Cusack deserves worldwide fame. Was it special effects or was it real puppets? I don't know, but I REALLY thought the puppets were something special, literally. As metaphor - they work. 2. Plot - whatever you think you know, you're probably right, but it does work, somehow. 3. Special effects / production design / cinematography - Works well. The 7.5th floor set is very amusing (I'm a cubicle-bound trog, so I'm biased). Most noteworthy - the ""Malkovich in his own head"" scene. I wake up in a cold sweat just thinking about it. Finally, the key issue - you can take a date or friend to see it. It is weird enough to be interesting, but not weird enough to put off the average multiplex-goer with a reasonable tolerance for something ""different."" Art-house lite, if you will.

I'm not easy on them either, but I have studied film for long  enough to judge with knowledge. I gave this movie two chances after  seeing how so many loved it. I just wanted to confirm to myself that it  really was  horrible. Yes, it has an interesting premise - but they come a  dime a dozen. The execution of the film was unordinarily poor. The lighting  was so bad  throughout... thinking back on the movie all I visually see is  muted colors in dark, uninteresting surroundings. Is this an intended  effect? I hope not - If  so, it bears no strong relationship with the film  for effect - and is just plain ugly. When there is enough lighting to see -  it is boring... as are the camera  angles. With the easy application of  great computer effects available, why was such a obvious and annoying  technique chosen for portraying vision  through malkovitch? Most film  students generate a higher standard of artistic filming - most television  programs do too for that matter
The plot did not make up for the poor and  uninteresting film making. One relationship twist was piled on top of the  other just to keep the movie going.  Suddenly someone becomes a transsexual  - and another can't decide who she loves (diaz or cusak inside malkovitch,  or malkovitch himself), or why  (the money and prestige, did she actually  love any of these characters.. this is never ever explained). Background  for the characters is not very good, nor  are their motives. The humor  occasionally caught me, but generally lacked. I did, however, enjoy some  connectivity between the movie shown through  puppeteering in cusak's  character in various ways... other than that - this is by far one of the  most over rated films in many years.

All the characters appeared drawn, like Barney Rubble. Very  flat, lacking any sense of space, the entire movie seemed small in scope. A  small environment can be an outstading setting for an intimate movie; this  movie lacks any endearing features of intimacy, ultimately keeping the  viwer at arm's length as the characters move from one unbelievable event to  the next, all surrounding the ""portal"" that leads to Malkovich's  mind.  Although at times zany and creative, set against the dimly lit  soundstage, and with stilted acting, the movie lacks any significant  ""punch"". No tension, no caring for the protagonist, no feelings  for the plight of Malkovich as he tries to unravel the mystery, Spike Jonze  has lost the audience on this one.

He is  misunderstood though, as he is ridiculed throughout the film for trying to  be a success with the art form that he loves.  Not until he is able to use  the notoriety of Malkovich, is he able to show the world what the artistry  of puppeteering is really about.
I think this is true in the real world  as well.  With all the different talents out there that people possess, I  think it's a shame that only a few are accepted and promoted by a mass  audience.

Election, Cube and this film, Being John Malkovich. These were all
films that dared to do something different and it didn't hurt that
they were all quite good too.
In this film, things seem to shift
focus quite frequently. It starts off with John Cusack looking for a
job and ending up working in a very strange place. Initially, it's
just funny with a weird boss, offices taking up half a floor and some
equally strange co-workers. .... Things get progressively stranger and
ultimately becomes sinister but the film is no less enjoyable for the
change of tone.
Notable is the chase through the memories in John
Malkovich's head, quite reminiscent of the Sminoff Vodka advertisement
with characters running through scenes in that would be impossible to
connect in the real world.
The cast is brilliant, Cameron Diaz is
almost unrecognisable from how we usually see her and outstanding.
Caroline Keener did get an Oscar nomination and of course there is
John Malkovich playing an actor who is not quite as famous as he is in
the real world (I think the jewel thief movie everyone think's he was
in was he was Entrapment - Well that's my theory) and just a bit
stranger too.  Particularly entertaining is the fight everyone has
over possession of John Malkovich's body while overlooking the fact
he's the only one entitled to it.
John Cusack also stands out as a
particularly tragic character, a man who is just as good at
puppeteering as his famous contemporaries but can only gain
recognition and fame using the springboard of someone else who is
already famous because he just can't get that first break he needs. As
things start to turn on him, he gets increasingly desperate and begins
a terminal slide to disaster. Despite the increasingly inexcusable
things he ends up doing, he pays what could only be described as the
ultimate price that even he didn't deserve. An important lesson on
when good people start doing bad things, it gets hard to stop

""Being John Malkovich"" is the product  of a brilliant script and very creative directing by Spike Jonze (who  starred in ""Three Kings"").  The acting is incredible and very  believable.  John Malkovich (""The Messenger,"" ""Dangerous  Liasons"") was both intelligent and brave to take a role in which he is  deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nomination and haillarious as he makes  fun of himself.
Anyone who can appreciate the bizarre (think ""12  Monkeys"" bizarre, but this is far better) will love this movie.  It is  not science fiction for those who dislike such films.  It is a hillarious  comedy with so many twists and turns one viewing does not serve this  amazing film justice.  Definetely worth buying.",958521600,3,1172,4.768844221105527
1077323,5,630580706X,"""Well, there's this guy...."" That's all that some viewers could really come up with when asked to describe ""Being John Malkovich"", the latest film starring Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Cusack. Oh...and John Malkovich is in it, too. This movie is so  original, I can't even begin to explain this movie, other than that it was  intelligent, fascinating, and hilarious. Because of the originality, it is  completely unpredictable: you are so completely in the dark trying to guess  what is going to happen next, that you end up not even bothering to  guess-which makes a great movie-going experience.
  Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a puppeteer who believes he is not  just a puppeteer, but an artist. Diaz, in a wig that makes her nearly  unrecognizable, plays Schwartz' animal-loving wife, Lotte. Cusack, upon the  realization that he might not make it as a puppeteer, decides to get a day  job, at a place on the seventh and half floor of a New York skyscraper. It  is here at this odd office floor, that Cusack stumbles upon a portal to  John Malkovich's brain-where he is allowed to experience what it is like to  be a celebrity for 15 minutes, and then be spit out somewhere outside the  New Jersey turnpike. Hilarity ensues, and metaphysical questions are asked.
  This movie is like a dream-and not in the sense that it's an  incredibly great movie, although it is. It's like a dream because of the  way that the logic is formatted. Things that have seemingly little  significance, have a large significance by the movie's end. We are whisked  away from plotline to plotline, that soon the rhythm of the rapidfire plot  becomes catchy. Things that would not make sense in most movies makes  complete sense here. Being John Malkovich's intentional irrationality make  this a dadaistic masterpiece, a trend that I am unsure if I would want  duplicated, because perhaps then motion pictures would become a medium for  the insane.
 The writer, Charlie Kaufmann, is quoted as saying that he  wrote it not thinking that it would ever turn into a film. In response,  John Malkovich said that only a writer who did not think that their script  could become a film would write such a script. I'd have an inclination to  agree with Malkovich, unless it has become hip to produce scripts that are  risky, odd, and seemingly drug-induced. This may well be the one movie that  you should see this year. Josh Bob says check it out. Five stars.",958521600,41,2444,4.798076923076923
1077324,3,630580706X,"This was a clever story although it did have quite a few slow spots.  John Malkovich is great.  No doubt about it.  And the premise was promising, but there was too much surrealism.  There were some very good scenes:  Malkovich inside himself, the A&E Biography.  But not enough to keep my  attention.  The DVD had some great extras including some very odd  interviews.  Not bad overall.",958435200,,387,4.7272727272727275
1077325,4,630580706X,"For sheer originality, it's hard to beat ""Being John Malkovich"" as the most outrageously entertaining comedy of 1999.  The central gimmick of Charlie Kaufmann's original screenplay is now widely known--a low-spirited  puppeteer (John Cusack) discovers a portal leading into the brain of the  actor John Malkovich (played by none other than Malkovich himself).  It may  sound unworkable on paper, but the approach to the storytelling is unique  and offbeat enough to overcome the most obvious hurdles.
Director Spike  Jonze proves himself a true cinematic visionary.  Rather than highlighting  his story with bright, vivid colors, Jonze adopts a restrained, subtle  visual style that that perfectly suits the film's sly, warped identity.  ""Malkovich"" is not an in-your-face comedy, and Jonze's wise choice of  murky, underlit camera angles make it clear that all attention belongs on  the actors, and on Kaufmann's script.
Jonze is just as adept at getting  great performances out of his cast.  Catherine Keener deservedly won an  Oscar nomination for her bitchy Maxine, but Cameron Diaz matches her,  moment for moment, in a much less showy and obvious role.  Cusack is  note-perfect as the squinting puppeteer, and Malkovich, proving himself the  best sport in Hollywood by starring in a film that so unabashedly makes fun  of his image, gives a brilliant, perfectly timed comic performance.
From  its odd premise the story builds and builds, tossing in one oddball twist  after
another with admirable energy.  ""Being John Malkovich"" tweaks its  off-the-wall plot for maximum comic effect; what's surprising is the  effectiveness with which it subtly eases in a few thought-provoking  questions.  Even more surprising is the way ""Being John Malkovich"" examines  each of its characters with considerable compassion, when it would be so  easy to treat them with contempt.  Sure, it's nonsense--only a truly  demented farce could find poignancy in a lesbian relationship involving  Malkovich as an unwitting sexual go-between--but the film embraces these  perverse notions with deadpan conviction.
Roger Ebert named ""Being John  Malkovich"" the best film of 1999.  It wasn't a bad choice, by any  means--the film damn well deserved a Best Picture nomination--but it's hard  to ignore the flaws that emerge in the construction toward the very end.  The film is successful only so long as it avoids attempting to explain its  premise; once ""Malkovich"" tries to take itself seriously, it derails faster  than a speeding train.  Kaufmann throws in a lousy subplot involving  geriatrics staging a hostile midnight takeover of Malkovich's brain, as  well as a chase scene through Malkovich's subconscious that, though clever,  borders on the excessive.  The last half hour or so is no less entertaining  than what came before it, but it's also surprisingly out of place in a film  that thrives by being subtle, not by flaunting its inventions.  Ebert  called the movie ""endlessly inventive,"" and that's as much a handicap as it  is a compliment.  Here is a movie so drunk on its own cleverness that it  doesn't know when to stop; it takes several risks, most of which pay off,  but it also takes one risk too many.  The result?  Almost the best film of  1999.",958348800,5,3250,5.201941747572816

I was completely annoyed with John Cusack's  preformance and I was never taken in by any of the story's quirkiness.  Some genuinely funny moments aside, I am at a loss of words to explain why  this movie was not only on ten best lists, but at the top of them as well.  I agree with another reviewer here with the phrase ""different doesn't  mean brilliant"".  Too often these days leading critics are confusing  those two words. While very different, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH was far from  brilliant.",958262400,3,744,4.389705882352941
1077370,5,630580706X,"This is an extraordinary movie. For a start you have John Cusack and Cameron Diaz looking awful (but acting great) then you have a bizarre storyline (a portal into John Malkovitch's head) and an even wierder  premise for an amazing movie.
John Cusack, a puppeteer with no work  (catch his street play) is married to animal lover Cameron Diaz (how can  you make someone so beautiful look so frumpy? They failed in Frankie and  Johnny but sure succeeded here). He gets a job in a filing firm situated in  between two floor of a building (so everyone has to crouch - low  overheads). During his work there he discovers the portal and together with  his object of lust (Catherine Keener) they set up a business where at $200  a shot anyone can spend 15 minutes inside John Malkovitch's mind).
But of  course there is confusion. Cameron Diaz loves Catherine Keener (and in a  brilliant scene tells John Cusack she wants surgery to make her a man), so  he locks her in an animal cage. There is so much in this movie, a secretary  (sorry excutive assistant) with dyslexic hearing, the ickiest pathway into  the portal one could imagine and some very wierd lust!
However, the prize  must go to John Malkovitch  for being able to poke fun at himself in such  an entertaining way. When Malkovitch himself goes through his own portal  you get the highlight of the movie: Malkovitch world. This must be the  funniest, craziest scene I have seen in a movie for a long, long  time.
However, underlying the hilarity is (or could be) a serious message  (or maybe I am taking the puppet metaphor too seriously). Nevertheless,  this is a must see movie. Spike Jonze (who later starred in Three Kings)  has created a masterpiece.",958176000,,1710,4.648829431438127

Many men will not like this film, my husband did not get it and  did not like it.
The cast is wonderful, I especially enjoyed Cameron  Diaz in a non-glam role as a frowzy, bi-sexual, animal lover. This gal can  act, and it's beyond me why she wasn't awarded something for her work.  Those who liked the glam Cameron Diaz in ""Something about Mary""  may be disappointed.  John Cusack is...John Cusack and John Malkovich is  ...John Malkovich. Both of them are masters of the weird, and this film is  weird.
I liked the film and I'll probably get it on DVD since it's the  kind of film you could watch over and over and see things you hadn't seen  the first, second, or third time.

For a film that is as much arthouse as it is mainstream it makes no point at all whatsoever and it comes nowhere near taking advantage of it's wondeerful premise. All we get is a shaggy John  Cusack and a bushy Cameron Diaz going head to head over Catherine Keener  through John Malkovich. It does has the occasional weird charm but I feel  like it could have been so much more. Only a few scenes raised a smile in  me.
Don't get me wrong. I've never seen a movie that had so much  originality to it but I have also never seen a movie that did so little  with its ingenius idea. It becomes quite boring and saggy in places.  Whenever this happened I just wanted it to go to another scene where they  go inside John Malkovich.
Also...the ending makes no sense whatsoever.  And the writer doesn't even give an explanation for the portal or how it is  possible. This may have worked for Groundhog Day but just seems lazy here.  As you may have guessed the ending annoyed me very much.
I do reccomend  you buy this DVD but it should go in your Obscure/Hit-Miss section. The  film doesn't have much of anything to classify it as belonging to a certain  genre.

This is the  feeling one gets watching ""Being John Malkovich"", one of the most  startling original films to come out in a long, long time. It's creativity  is boundless, it's humour is bracing, and it's depth is sobering. It's hard  to think of a film that combines so many diverse elements and still work  perfectly, but this one does. This is a modern fable that feels like a  game, while it's characters (John Cusask, Cameron Diaz, Cathering Keener  and John Malkovich deliver superb performances) are mere puppets hanging on  a string, waiting to be in the movement of things. ""Being John  Malkovich"" raises some fascinating issues about the illusion of  celebrity, the quest for identity, and the way lust and greed can twist  people's live around. You can't help but wonder how some of it's ideas got  conceived in the first place, and why they work so well on screen. But if  you really want to nit-pick, the film does get too outlandishly serious  towards the end, but even this weakness cannot erase it's overall  brillance. It is safe to say that director Spike Jonze will be along side  Paul Thomas Anderson and David Fincher as the best new film-makers of the  21st century.

I know that that is what touched me  the most - why cant I be more like him, or more like her, why cant I have  this, why cant I have that?  Ultimately, the lesson of the movie (in my  humble opinion at least) is to appreciate what you have and who you are  instead of longing to be someone you are not.  The image of the frustrated  puppeteer thinking that he finally has become what he truly wants by  manipulating the ultimate puppet (another human being and a very successful  other human being at that) without realizing that HE is the one who is  really being manipulated (by his own unfulfilled longings) is a masterful  touch - ironic and, to me, very sad and, very sadly, a very typically human  situation.",957916800,,969,4.329608938547486
1077411,4,630580706X,"This is a clever and imaginative story with a lot of droll and peculiar situations that make for an entertaining film.  John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a frustrated puppeteer who can't find work.  He takes a job as a  file clerk and discovers a portal that leads inside John Malkovich's head  that allows him to see and experience what Malkovich is doing for 15  minutes until it spits him out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  The remainder  of the film uses this device to create absurd uses for the portal, from  selling tickets to Malkovich to two women having sex using Malkovich's  body.
Ultimately, the puppeteer discovers how to take over Malkovich and  he proceeds to usurp Malkovich's life.  In one particularly ingenious  scene, Schwartz is manipulating Malkovich to be a puppeteer who has a  marionette manipulating yet another smaller marionette.  It's a little like  Russian matroishka dolls where every time you open one, there is another  smaller one inside.  If you take it one step further, it was really Maxine  who was the master puppeteer, manipulating Schwartz to manipulate  Malkovich.
This film goes beyond humor of the absurd to humor of the  bizarre.  At times it gets a bit too far out to be funny (like when  Malkovich goes inside Malkovich and sees Malkovich's everywhere).  But the  material is fresh and innovative and most of the skits work well, silly as  they sometimes are.
Spike Jonze is a strange guy with a strange sense of  humor which is perfect for this film.  If you get the DVD, one of the bonus  features is an interview with Jonze.  If you see this interview, you will  get a fuller understanding of just how strange he can be.  He does some  very interesting things with the camera, lighting and setup that give the  film a very distinctive look.  This was Jonze first feature film.  Clearly  his work in music videos, where directors are a lot freer to push the  creative envelope, helped in the making of this film.  I thought he could  have done a better job with the Malkovich perspective (it looked like you  were looking backwards through a pair of binoculars), but most of the  camera work was quite good.  I particularly liked the way he split the  sound tracks to have Malkovich's voice come out of the back speakers while  in his perspective.
The acting in this film was terrific.  John  Malkovich, who excels in both dramatic and comedic roles did a fabulous job  of playing himself, poking fun at himself at every turn.  Poor John Cusack.  He is such a tall guy and they made him play half his part on a set with 4   foot ceilings.  He was very funny as the tortured puppeteer.  Catherine  Keener was a scream as the bitchy and evil Maxine.
Overall, this film is  a rollicking good time.  I rated it 8/10.  It is funny throughout but  sometimes goes a little too far off the deep end.  If you like absurd  humor, you will love this film.",957916800,2,2892,4.6099009900990096

The plot itself is intricate and discourages passive viewing,  and is layed out in such a refreshingly understated fashion that you won't  even realize just how unusual what you are seeing actually is.  The story  involves a down and out puppeteer (John Cusack) who starts work in a  ""filing company"" in an office that has to be seen to be believed.  While working there, he discovers a hole in the wall that is a portal to  John Malkovich's mind.  Along with a mysterious and beautiful  coworker(Catherine Keener), Cusack's character starts a company that gives  people who are tired of being themselves, the chance to enter the portal  and be John Malkovich.  Eventually Malkovich himself gets wind of the  company (how and why this happens is another element that defies  description) and the movie enters a new realm of engaging wierdness.  This  movie is not wierd in the sense of most 90s ""wierd"" movies (i.e.  externally eccentric, but essentially lifeless characters), but is wierd  the way a Van Gogh painting is or a piece of music by Scriabin or Schonberg  is.  The acting is absolutely superb (Cameron Diaz, for example, shows  herself to have a real sense of irony in her self-effacing performance),  and it is a lot of fun to imagine what Malkovich himself must have been  thinking while filming the movie.  A portal to his mind indeed would be  handy in this respect.
Finally, the film explores what it means to be a  person in an existence in which we are limited by our own consciousness.  The film plays on this theme in inventive ways, most revealingly I think,  in a scene in which Malkovich enters his own mind.  The conclusions that  the movie draws from this are quite surprising, and a little depressing.  Do not hesitate to watch this film.  Enjoy!",957830400,,1989,4.801186943620178

Ask yourself when was the  last time you saw a movie where every character felt completely real while  at the same time getting a feeling that you've never really met anyone like  this before. Well, that applies to every character in the film, and the  wonderful thing about it all is that they all compliment each other and  enhance the story enormously.
John Cusak is at the same time pathetic  and endearing, an artist who finds the zenith of his art in the unlikeliest  of places; John Malkovich.  Why Malkovich chose to back this project is  easy to see, Charlie Kaufmann's script is not about an actor, but about the  persona the actor projects. It could have been anyone, and yet the choice  of someone like Malkovich adds quirkiness to an already crazy  story. Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz are wonderful. Keener can play cool  like no one else and Diaz is great in the role of sensitive Lotte.
The  film is visually stunning, the musical score is appropriately sullen and  magical. Spike Jonze created a world I'd never seen before and even more  incredibly, it made me really appreciate puppetry!",957830400,,1358,4.735042735042735

However, it might be worth hanging in there just to watch Mr.  Malkovich not take himself so seriously.  (My estimation for him has gone  way up since seeing this movie.)  And I must admit:  the scene where  Malkovich goes through the  ""portal""  and into his own brain is  insanely inspired and absolutely hilarious, and almost makes the film  justifiable.
But one brilliant sequence is not enough to salvage this  immature baby.  The  ""plot""  goes off the deep end during the  last act.  Some perhaps find -- for example -- the Malkovich cult's  resemblance to the  *Rosemary's Baby*  coven very clever, but after an  entire movie full of such derivative stuff, it finally drove me beyond the  bounds of patience.

1077418,4,630580706X,"Once in a while a movie comes along that really challenges the mind.  It is a movie that differs from the usual formulas of filmmaking and develops its own genre.  Such fine examples would be David Lynche's ""Lost  Highway"" and David Fincher's ""The Game"".  Spike Jonze's  ""Being John Malcovich"" is the most unusual film I believe I have  ever seen.
John Cusak is a puppeteer who finds work on the 7 1/2 floor  of a building.  One day he finds a door that takes you inside the head of  actor John Malcovich for 15 minutes before dumping you on the Jersey  turnpike.  From there it gets even more strange.
There are good  performances for this film even from Malcovich as himself.  Watch for  Charlie Sheen's humorous cameo in the film as well.  The film tends to go a  little long and it seemed like they used the last 30 minutes to throw as  many oddites as they could in the last part of the film.

Imagine if they saw this as a business  opportunity. That's what Being John Malcovich is all about. Imagination is  the key. The entire story has a creative adolescent spirit. There is  nothing complicated here. A man (John Cusak) finds a door on the 7 1/2  floor of a building and it takes you inside of John Malcovich for about 15  minutes, then you're dropped onto the side of the New Jersey turnpike. Form  this revolves a plot involving sex, greed, and voyeurism. This simple  elegance is what makes this film so enticing. Who hasn't imagined what it  would be like to live in another's shoes. This movie brings reality to an  idea most of us dismissed at the age of 12. Suddenly we're in a surreal  place where an office can exist on the 7 1/2 floor and you can actually be  another person. The movie takes your intellect on a thrill ride.
This  kind of idea and environment is what Spike Jonez was put on this planet to  direct. You feel as if he, and only he, could bring a film of this  substance to life. The whole thing cannot be described as a movie but  rather an experience. It is unlike anything you have ever seen.
This  movie is for people who liked to be challenged and entertained by new  ideas. If you like films that simply feed you information, you'll probably  hate this movie. You have to be willing to try something different.",957657600,,1522,4.492700729927007

The other  day I was buying a hat and had my first real-life ""loden""  experience.  You will remember loden is Malkovich's second choice color for  his bath towels when he finds periwinkle is out of stock.  Well, I was  picking out a hat at a haberdashery, and as I checked out the label I saw  that the color was loden.  It was hilarious, but impossible to explain to  the clerk.
I can't believe Being John Malkovich was overlooked by the  Academy this year.  It truly was better than anything else, and it has  advanced film and humor theory forward more than any movie in a long time.  In that respect it has a lot in common with Pulp Fiction.
It also would  have been nice to hear the following surreal announcement at the Oscars:  ""And the Oscar goes to... John Malkovich, for Being John  Malkovich.""",957657600,,1014,4.6971428571428575

1.  Is the portal in the office building the same one that Captain..Whatever  His Name Was found 90 years ago?
2.  So let me see if I've got this  right: if you enter the portal in the pupal stage, you get stuck forever in  the body, if you enter the portal in the larval stage, you get kicked out  after 15 minutes, and if you enter the portal in the ripe stage (is it  always on the 44th birthday?), you stay in the body for good?
3. What  determines who the portal will go to next?  And is it always the same  portal (the one in the building?)And is it just coincidence that the  daughter is the next person the portal leads to or am I missing something?  Is it because she's Malkovich's daugter?  And what determined that the  portal led to John Malkovich for that matter?
4.  So Dr. Lester started  out as that Captain, jumped to Lester, and then to Malkovich, and that's  why he says he's 105 years old?  Or is Lester really 105 years old because  of the carrot juice?
Maybe I'm thinking too hard here, but I know there  are answers to these questions, and, like I said, it's driving me crazy.  It keeps me from fully enjoying the movie.  Help me out, people! E-mail me  with some answers at:  rosebrockp@hotmail.com Thanks!",957312000,,1439,4.276119402985074

With ""Being John Malkovich"", Spike Jonze delivers a better first-time directing effort than other first-timers have in a long time.
Most of all, this film stands out for its ideas.  Whatever went on inside the mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the  creativity that emerges in this film is the kind that audiences should get  to see more often on the big screen.
Kaufman's script is one of the  best and most original of the 1990's.

Being John Malkovich is a film about how people are willing to disguise, and lie to their true selves in order to protect the small pieces of happiness they  obtain in life. Craig Schwartz is a puppeteer who projects his inner  conflict through his performances. His wife projects her empathy, and  insecurity on to her pets. These two people live in isolation even though  they are married. When Craig needs to find work he finds it at a ""down  sized"" business on the 7 1/2 floor of old building. The building holds  a secret... a portal into John Malkovich's mind. Does this need to make  sense. No it does not. What is important that the character's find a place  where they can hide their identy, and become what they wish because of John  Malkovich's celeberty. I will go no further in discribing the plot because  there are many surprises to be had in this movie.

In a perpetual  state of confusion that only seems to make any sense when we give ourselves  over or are controlled by someone else and then wondering when the  experience is over how things have gotten worse.

1077653,5,630580706X,"Being John Malkovitch is many things simultaneously.  With a heady layering of allusion it provides a reductio ad absudum comment on Cartesian dualism while at the same time lampooning modern narcissistic approaches to  acting.  All this and at the same time Being John Malkovitch ranks with the  best of the screwball comedies.
The strange world of the seven and a half  (suggesting Fellini's 8 )floor immediately sets the viewers body on edge.  The effect is visceral and sets up the desire to get out of the cramped  space and therefore out of the body.  Very soon there is an Alice in  Wonderland quality with the distorted communication, the tiny doorway and  subterranean tunnel.  This tunnel though takes us to a postmodern  Wonderland.
One of the great jokes of the movie is the casting of Orson  Bean as the 105-year-old Dr. Lester.  I last recall Bean some years ago had  a keen interest in the theories of Wilhelm Reich, which involved some  notion life extension and enhanced sexual potency through collecting orgone  energy. To see him reappear as the geriatric lech almost made me wet  myself.  The Spellbound spoofing psychoanalytic epiphany of the chimp was  another high point.",956016000,,1194,4.964467005076142

The acting was equally impressive.  John Cusack has long been one of my favorite actors, and this may be his  best, most developed performance yet.  Even when he was doing greedy,  selfish things, I still sympathized with him.  Cameron Diaz was perfect in  an against type role (a friend of mine didn't know it was her until he saw  her name in the credits).  Catherine Keener certainly deserved her Oscar  nomination, and John Malkovich himself was hilarious as the man trying to  figure his way through this ""metaphysical can of worms"".  I'm so  glad that Spike Jonze directed this move, having been a fan of his since  the days of the Girl/Chocolate skateboard videos.  Jonze really came  through with the perfect mix of subdued cinematography and wacky visuals.  1999 was a really good year for movies, Bringing Out the Dead, Magnolia,  Three Kings, The Insider, and The Limey will all be remembered for years to  come, but Being John Malkovich was the best and most memorable, without a  doubt.",954979200,11,1337,4.9818181818181815

1077719,5,630580706X,"Don't get me wrong- I loved American Beauty.  I was shocked by The Sixth Sense.  I was moved by Magnolia.  But for me, the movie in 1999 that made me sit back and say ""wow"" was Being John Malkovich.
I am sure  you know the plot, and words wouldn't help to describe how original (and  ingenious) it is.  The film works on so many levels- it is a screwball  comedy, an existential discussion of the nature of existence, a study of  sexual identity, and a satire of the modern desire to ""escape""  from life.  On top of all of that, it is darn entertaining to watch!
The  characters (played to perfection but Cusack, Diaz, Keener, and Malkovich  himself) are all well-drawn, and the actors do a fantastic job- wait until  you see Diaz, unrecognizable in frizzy hair and frumpy dress.
The  directing is top notch as well.  Spike Jonze (of Three Kings fame) has made  a wise choice- he recognizes the script is the star and has directed a film  without any flashy camera work, which would detract from the real focal  point.  That is not to say the work is pedestrian- he did everything that  had to be done to make the film, and he did it well (note his Oscar nod for  best director).
The production design is a big star here as well.  The 7  1/2 floor is almost ""Gilliam-esque""- in fact, when I first saw  the preview I assumed it was Terry Gilliam's (Brazil, 12 Monkeys) newest  film.
The best word to describe this film is ""giddy.""  I saw  that because that is what I brought away from it- I felt giddy watching it,  and you can teel the cast and crew felt the same making it.  The best thing  I have read about the film was from a rejection letter from another studio,  which neglected to option the screenplay:  ""I'm sure Being John  Malkovich would be regarded as a work of genius on whatever planet it was  written.""  If that doesn't make you want to see the thing, nothing  will.",954547200,170,1882,4.353623188405797

I feel like my entire life is just  passing time until my preordered BJM DVD from Amazon gets here.  Inventive  and hilarious can't begin to describe this film.  Sure, there are questions  that the whole scenario brings up and does not answer but, hey... in a  world where Titanics and Phantom Menaces are made and praised, this is a  more than welcome change.",954460800,2,542,4.36
1077721,5,630580706X,"In case, you don't know, that's a line from an Oingo Boingo song.
Being John Malkovich is a movie about people. John Cusack is an unemployed puppeteer who gets a new job in a very peculiar place: the 7 & 1/2  floor of an office building. He soon discovers a tunnel into the mind of  movie star John Malkovich.
That's the plot at it's most basic. Trying to  summarize this movie is like trying to explain what color looks like to a  blind man. It is a shockingly original, amazing film. It was truly robbed  of an Oscar for best original screenplay: while American Beauty was good,  it wasn't as good as Malkovich and not nearly as original.
The direction  by Spike Jonze is strange and surreal. There aren't a lot of bright colors  or beautiful shots, but the movie really draws you in with it's dark,  strange atmosphere. As I said before, the screenplay is utterly brilliant.  The movie kind of reminds me of Terry Gilliam's Brazil - only it's not  nearly as maddening to watch.
The performances are quite good, but really  do serve the story. No one stands out in this movie. Not even Malkovich.  One note: if you don't pay attention, the plot may confuse you a  bit.
Being John Malkovich is a very rare kind of movie indeed: one that  is stunningly original and incredibly well-done. Truly a must-see.",954288000,25,1305,4.517094017094017
1077722,5,630580706X,"A movie doesn't have to be ""Schindler's List"" to be good. Sometimes people forget that movies don't always have to take themselves so seriously. Yet, action flicks sometimes don't take themselves seriously  enough.
""Being John Malkovich"" rises to the challenge to  produce a whimsical, utterly HILARIOUS story that is so outright absurd and  bizarre from the very start, most viewers will stop trying to make sense of  it after about five minutes into the film. It is then that the audience  just lays back, goes with the flow and HAS FUN! If you're someone who  always has to understand every detail and motive for every action in a  film, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU!
But, if you can handle some silliness,  and really like to laugh, watch this movie. You won't be sorry. I was  almost crying from laughter in my seat. The whole audience was in an  uproar.

What does all this add up to?  One of the  greatest films of 1999.  If you are tired of the typical  ""Hollywood"" comedy, give this truly orginal film a chance.

We get a wishy-washy hot girl from the office who thinks she's in love with one person, then another, then another, and back again. But she isn't compelling to watch; none of the characters feel like people, and the world they live in is so selectively bizarre (i.e. no one is very surprised by the Malkovich portal, but the actor himself threatens to...sue someone over it?). All that said, it has its funny moments, and I'd definitely give it a watch if you're a die-hard Jonze fan, especially if your favorite parts of ""Her"" were the verbal sex descriptions and third-person direction of a sexual surrogate.
