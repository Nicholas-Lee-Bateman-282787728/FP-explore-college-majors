7957841,1,B000062XFJ,"Was done told that this here joker had a few of these scarce DVD Movies of ""HITCHED"", Starring Anthony Michael Hall. I done called they bluff and ordered up a single disc, just to show that they ain't had not a single copy. Sure enough they done me silly dirty by sending out a 'Floater', a copy that has became undone from its middle anchor spindle center area. Floaters are always damaged, and since I don't/won't accept floaters or deal with them in any sort of capacity. I just knew that's what type of DVD item I would know to expect, whenever you get what you truly pay for. Clowns charging peanuts for a purely proven product aren't selling that item, but only cheapening its worth.",1437004800,,689,4.476190476190476
7957842,3,B000062XFJ,"Don't bother getting this dvd unless you're a big Sheryl Lee fan! I really couldn't decide if this was supposed to be a drama with some black humor thrown in or if it was supposed to be a comedy with some drama thrown in. I only got this because I am a big fan of Sheryl Lee's (she should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for her performance in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me). Her acting is alittle uneven here, but I think that's the director's fault. The storyline is different.",1365984000,,489,4.212765957446808
7957843,3,B000062XFJ,"What would a woman do when she finds out that her husband has been having a bit on the side,breaking his marriage vows and betraying her trust?? Most would find a good lawyer fast, take the house, and make sure the only account he has left is the one he has to settle with you..Not Sheryl Lee Diamond. Anthony Michael Hall could not control his libido as he put it 'it has no conscience!??!'-I thought they stopped saying this in 70s?!-
So his still loving but hurt wife makes sure he will never cheat on her again by chaining him to a bed in the basement with chains so thick , the type of which you only used to see in circuses around some poor elephant!
At this point and for a TV movie things were not bad, especially since Lee does a wonderful job portraying the mentally unstable wife.
Only when Hall manages to break his solid and thick chains using the needle of an old dusty record player,after barely surviving on a diet of frozen food that the film started to test my intelligence and patience!
Well,Hall wants his wife to taste the mental and physical torture she has put him through, so he chains her back and again the same situation happens but is now reversed.
The script is very weak indeed..I mean my first thought seeing this couple chaining each other for months on end is where do they do their 'business' or bathe???? neither Lee nor later Hall's noses twitch for even a mere second entering this basement. And why Hall is sometimes clean shaven at at others with a two-day stubble?? These details might seem trivial, but are important for any writer or director not to overlook.
I do not wish to spoil the ending, no matter how strong the temptation is, save to say that Lee becomes so mentally unstable that she takes bond in a relationship or marriage as meaning Bondage..literarly.
Despite my three stars, Hitched is still worth watching only for Lee's acting, and maybe learning a lesson or two ,one can be if your wife looks like Sheryl Lee,you better think twice about the 'lack of conscience' issue, the other maybe will be never buy a house with a basement, and if so make sure you have not thrown away that old record player!",1075248000,7,2157,4.477157360406092
7957844,5,B000062XFJ,"I loved this movie! I won't give any spoilers, I'll only give you what would be described on the back of the DVD. Eve (played by Sheryl Lee Diamond) gets a call in the middle of the night telling her that her husband Ted (played by Anthony Michael Hall) was in a car accident. While at the hospital she learns that her husband has been cheating on her, and then finds out that it wasn't with just one woman either.. Well when most women would either cry, or slip into denial, Eve decides to ""protect"" their marriage. How do you ask? By chaining him to the floor of their hidden ""speakeasy"" in the basement. With nice flashbacks showing their marriage months before, and funny dialogue between the core characters, this film is just priceless. What woman wouldn't want to do what Eve does? This film has cute twists, and an ending that will crack you up! Anthony Michael Hall delivers a great performance (as always) This movie is very cute and unique. AMH in chains..that is reason enough to see this movie!",1029196800,8,1007,4.538461538461538
