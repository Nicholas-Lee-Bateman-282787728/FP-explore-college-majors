8566927,3,B00BE6I0BU,"In the event one runs across this among others of the Crime Club ""B"" movie series, that is, the short second feature accompanying the film people came to see, a practice begun in the Great Depression and continued into the mid-50's or thereabouts, this is a brief review for the younger set who were not around in those days. This particular hour film stars Bruce Cabot, a solid feature player who appeared in many movies of the era and includes Tom Dugan, another regular who provides comedy(!) relief...at least that was the intention. In the hour of the film, murder is committed in a Hospital with the police called in to solve the crime. One suspect is Bruce Cabot, surgeon, who has reason to dislike the victim. From there the action is pretty much what it continued to be through the tv era of Dick Van Dyke...and  probably still today. I wouldn't rate it as competitive with  that or other television shows today, all of which would have much more spent on them than was true of the Quickie series of those years...but this and other films in the series have the charm of simplicity and obviousness. I wouldn't want to pay much for any one of them singly but if you can find a seller who will give you a batch for little money...it is nice filler for that last hour of the viewing day when one wants to let the brain begin its relaxation before sleep.",1459382400,,1359,4.475806451612903
