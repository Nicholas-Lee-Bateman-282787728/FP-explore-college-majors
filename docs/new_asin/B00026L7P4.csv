2063340,5,B00026L7P4,"Very few movies can be so bad that they become good, The Apple is one of them.  Pointless plot, terrible music, bad acting, costumes that even Elton John wouldn't wear and an excessive amount of glitter all converge creating a colossal piece of crap.  My boyfriend took me to see this on our first date and I realized that I had found my soul mate.
I would not recommend this to anyone who is not a fan of camp, but for those of you who just love to laugh at terrible film making this is the god (Mr. Tops) awful musical extravaganza you have been waiting for. I have already pre-ordered my copy and I strongly recommend you do the same, since your DVD collection will never truly be completely without it.",1089936000,6,706,4.340909090909091
2063341,5,B00026L7P4,"I first saw this movie when my family first got cable back around 1982.  I couldn't imagine why this movie was ever made because it had to have been the absolute worst movie produced in the history of modern cinema.  The stiff acting, the cheesy dialogue (Bibi going to tour ""The West Coast??""  I guess playing New York wasn't that big of a deal), the songs, scary choreography.  And set (at the time) in futuristic 1994.  Evidently the fashion style of choice in '94 was destined to be shiny garbage bags.  And now, this god-awful movie is being released on DVD, in of all months, the month of my birthday.  And you better believe I'll be one of the first people to own it!  My top favorite movies are ""Roxanne"" with Steve Martin, ""The Shawshank Redemption""...and ""The Apple.""  And I'm not kidding.
As far as cinematic greatness, this movie doesn't belong in the same category as your basic Academy Award winners.  However in terms of what you could watch over and over and never get tired of it, this ranks very high.  Yes, it's a horrible story, badly acted, the songs make me cringe - ""Pumpin' power by the hour - Speeeed!""  ""It's a natural natural natural desire, meet an actual actual actual vampire!"" (and on a side note, what was with that guy with the warthog / pig nose and blue hair during that whole ""hell"" scene?), the ending still has me shaking my head (was Mr. Topps God??  And why did he arrive in the limo, yet he and everybody else walked away?  And did they actually walk to another planet, which in reality is a pretty far walk...but if they left in 1980, they probably should be there by now).  But I love every second of this movie.  Love the cheesiness, love the music (I was so happy when a friend found the vinyl soundtrack in a bargain bin.....for...um......25 cents...I've since turned every track into an MP3 and burned it onto a CD since I know Cannon won't be doing it) and love everything about this movie.
And while I'm excited that this is going to be released on DVD, I just know that there won't be any special features on it, which bothers me.  I have to see some behind the scenes stuff, some outtakes, some DELETED scenes, director commentary throughout the movie, interviews with the actors (then AND a ""where are they now?"" section), clips from when the movie was released and the impact it had around the world when it opened - you know - STUFF!!  But at least it looks like it'll be available in full screen and wide screen, so there won't be that ""pan and scan"" look from my copy where there's dialogue going on from people off to the side of the screen - perhaps I'll now be able to see all of the action.
Even though I'm going to, it's hard for me to recommend this movie because of the difficulty I experience when trying to explain the plot of this movie for people.  I always run into problems with how Dandi (white guy) and Pandi (black girl) are brother and sister (who did Mr. Boogaloo get busy with?).  And I didn't know that the movie was SUPPOSED to be set here in America (all these years, I just assumed it was Germany or somewhere in Europe because nothing in the movie looked like anywhere in the U.S. - especially that subway tram Alfie was riding on after that recording session).  But I will say that the world in this movie has the best race-relations I've ever seen - race is not even an issue with anything.  As convoluted and ridiculous as this movie is, there's a great lesson we all could take from it; especially in the world today.
Anyway, I love this movie and can't wait for its release date.  And if you haven't seen this movie and you're looking for pure escapism, fantasy and campiness, as well as a happy (if not puzzling) ending, put logic and reason aside, keep an open mind and you will enjoy this.  Just watch out for ""the red tape.""",1087603200,7,3813,4.422031473533619
2063342,5,B00026L7P4,"I've been waiting for this release for nearly 15 years.  The music is terrible, the acting is ridiculous, the premise is nearly exactly what the major music labels already do to the music fans who buy their wares (hello ""American Idol"") and it makes ""Can't Stop the Music"" (aka the Village people movie) look like highbrow art.
So in other words... You can't lose if you see this film.",1086220800,3,385,4.579710144927536
2063343,5,B00026L7P4,"Oh, where does one begin?  ""The Apple"" is just one of the best cinematic experiences I have had in my life.  I saw a midnight showing of it in March of 2004 at a theater in NYC, and the entire place was shrieking and howling in miserable delight.  If you revel in amazingly bad movies (and this one's a musical from 1980, so you know it's really gonna stink), this is for you. Do not pass up the chance to own this piece of crap.  I'm completely serious.  The shimmer of the costumes, the awful acting, the terrible music, the tight little thongs everyone is wearing and oh yes--it's set in the awfully distant future of 1994.

The songs are also quite stupid too, but they eventually catch on and you will start singing along with them because the people who sing are not bad singers, well, just listen to the lyrics and you will find out.  I recommend you buy this and watch it with a buntch of friends.  It is awesome even though the plot quite stupid and the acting is very bad with some things that are just wierd.  It like the Rocky Horror Picture Show gone bad and in the future of 1994 from a 1980's perspective.  Don't miss out on seeing this movie!!!!!",1083888000,3,652,4.184

2063346,3,B00026L7P4,"Very, very campy.  It was made about 5 years too late.  The music that would have sounded fresh and innovative in the mid-to-late 1970s sounds dated in 1980.  That being said, it's an interesting enough movie; take a look at its Wikipedia page, and the behind the scenes information is very enlightening as to why and how this movie ended up the way it is.

Its only real problem is the copy right infringement issues it suffers.

It revolves around a hit song about BIM. No one knows what a BIM is. They use the ""word"" BIM like it's interchangeable for ANYTHING. Like ""Smurf"", without the logic. It's all about singing and dancing, yet no one can really sing and the dancers mostly just punch and karate chop. It's like a human Muppet show fever dream, with lots of glitter stickers and pleather.

Apparently in the future you just stick extra parts on your car and wear garbage on your head like a crazy person. Being in tune or synchronized with all the other people dancing and ""singing"" in what appears to be an abandon (yet well lit) airport is purely optional. At least if you're a creepy guy with a lazy eye and giant cubic zirconia clip-on earring, it's optional. Oh, is that a squared trombone? Wow, I can't wait for the future guys!

Worst part of it all is they really thought they had something here. They really feel they're saying something important and deeply meaningful. Did I mention that everyone wears a BIM sticker on their foreheads? So deep...

What they really did was make maybe the worst movie I've seen. Ever.

The camp of ""Rocky Horror"" mixed with the Faustian elements of ""Phantom Of The Paradise"" and so outrageous that it could have been a John Waters movie minus the perverted sexuality. The songs are not as good as ""Rocky Horror"" but they don't seem to be as cloying as Paul Williams' score from ""Phantom"". Made in 1980 but set in 1994. The creepy thing is that their futuristic vision of what rock'n'roll will become in 1994 is not too far from the awful truth.

I must admit that for the first 20 or so minutes I was strictly in ""WTF Mode"" but then I seemed to get swept up in the madness.

It is like, Once you go Apple, you cannot go any other way. This is a great movie.

2063426,1,B00026L7P4,"Like the other reviewers, I must agree that this is one of the worst films you can ever watch. It's timing release was bad, the story is more cheesy than a triple-cheese pizza, the inclusive add-ins of acting make no sense, and the circus stuff is even more ridiculous. I think the entire cast and crew were so high on cocaine and LSD that they completely justified it, include the hippie movement at the end of the film. Totally ludicrous.

This film also severely hurt the film career of Catherine Mry Stewart. She nearly bounced back after ""Night of the Comet"", but then ""The Last Starfighter"" shot her back down, mostly ending her film career. In all honesty, this is a movie to get high on, or to bang to. This film was exactly like Xanadu, musical and creative, but way too cheesy and timed all wrong.

2063429,5,B00026L7P4,"In the canon of so-bad-they're-amazing movies, ""The Apple"" ranks somewhere in the vicinity of ""Howard the Duck"" and ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians."" The story is somewhat an amalgam of ""Phantom of the Paradise"" (its Faustian elements and music-industry satire), ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (ditto, and ""The Apple"" is much better), ""Xanadu"" (pop cheese circa 1980), ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (the camp, the glam, and the tight shiny underwear), ""Hair"" (the hippies) and John Huston's ""The Bible"" (seems to be inspired by the Adam/Eve story as interpreted by Huston). It's 86 minutes long, which is about the proper duration for a movie like this. The costumes are so mind-bogglingly over-the-top, as both the elaborate and the underwear seem to have cost about the same. The performances and writing are horrendous, but kudos to Vladek Sheybal and Ray Shell for acknowledging they're in a movie that's supposed to be trashy. Miriam Margolyes also has a hilarious (if stereotypical) supporting role as a landlady. This is the kind of movie that begs to be watched and simultaneously mocked and celebrated. You must watch it in widescreen format, for the full effect of the money that was spent on it (no B-level schlock is this!) One quibble: the trailer features material not in the actual movie.

""The Apple"" is truly something special.  The debut film of Catherine Mary Stewart, the bad movie queen of the 80s and 90s, this is also one of the first Cannon pictures, and it almost sank Cannon before it even got off the ground.  The restored DVD is pristine, and shows that very little expense was spared in making this perplexing, baffling mess - hundreds of extras, elaborate sets, bizarre costumes, and other trappings that show this was no ordinary B-movie.  The songs are bad, the acting is horrible, the writing and direction are worse.  But, ""The Apple"" maintains a high level of energy, as well as such amazing levels of badness that the movie is more entertaining than many ""good"" movies.  And, I won't give a spoiler, but, hippies?  Really?  Like Cartman, I refuse to place my faith in hippies.

An earnest movie warning the audience about evil record producers, created by Golan/Globus, men who made a career of producing movies that cheated audiences.

It WAS fun to see such a flagrant gay sensibility in a 1980 movie.  One dance number cut between firemen, construction workers, policemen in tights, and a biker gang in black leather.  But the flip side of that is that the women's costumes weren't sexy: they were just weird.

There are hippies. The main character wears his jeans so tight he walks like he has braces on his legs. There's a surreal ballet number in an abandoned convention center. A demonic cave.

2063448,4,B00026L7P4,"This film, released in 1980 and prognosticating all the way to 1994 is a Golan-Globus production, and is essentially a reworking of the Faust legend. (After viewing it I have to wonder if Menahem Golan made a horrible pact with the devil.) I have seen an enormous number of terrible movies in my life, but this is right at the top of the heap for unadulterated camp. I will note now that the four star rating is obviously due to the ""so bad it's good quality"" of the film rather than any intrinsic redeeming qualities the film actually has.

The film opens at a wretched music contest where the awful band promoted by ""Mr. Boogalow"" (Vladek Sheybal) is neck in neck with a small-time duo from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, the cloying Bibi and Alphie. Boogalow resorts to devious means to win, but feels threatened enough to attempt to sign them to contracts. Boogalow give them little time to read the contracts and since they don't have legal representation, Alphie refuses to sign, while Bibi signs her soul away. If all this symbolism wasn't clear enough, there is a musical field trip to the lake of fire proving Boogalow's real identity; as a further confirmation Bibi is presented with an apple (not golden or delicious) that she is pressured into biting.

After the premise that music agents are analogous to the devil (not far from the truth in some instances) is firmly established, we learn that in the future cars feature completely ridiculous profiles, that triangles are the only shape sanctioned by B.I.M. (Boogalow's agency), and that B.I.M. and the government are essentially one organization. I was especially amused by the concept of the ""National Fitness Program"" (a government program sponsored by our favorite Faustian NGO, B.I.M.), though less amused by the dancing involved. On the other end of the spectrum, I was completely unamused by Vladek Sheybal's singing voice when he solos in ""The Master,"" perhaps the worst vocal performance since the day of Florence Foster Jenkins.

Bibi gets a makeover and becomes wildly successful, while Alphie continues to write horrid folk songs and live in a dump. Eventually Alphie decides living in a cave under a bridge is better than his apartment, so he moves in with a commune of hippies with names like ""Lotus Blossom."" Bibi escapes the clutches of Boogalow and company and joins Alphie, only to have the entire commune arrested for harboring a fugitive. Yes, Bibi is wanted for breach of contract and Boogalow and his team of lawyers and police show up for a final confrontation of Lawyers versus Hippies. This posed a conundrum: which group is less appealing? No, I jest: the movie makes it clear that it is a battle of good and evil on a titanic scale. When our heroes have seemingly no options left, the film takes a spiritual turn and presents some theology decidedly not found in the Bible. The alleged deity, ""Mr. Topps,"" shows up in a golden Rolls-Royce in the sky, turns the hippies to angels, and utterly defeats Boogalow in a scene that must be seen to be believed. I am sure this must have had something to do with the fact that the film was way over budget due to the cost of the insane costumes and musical numbers; well, that and the production team had absolutely no idea how to wrap up this mess.

The film is low on dialogue, but high on musical numbers. It's kind of like a steam roller: once you are relieved that a musical number is over (and you will be), another one starts. The costumes and makeup are delightfully kitsch (I especially like the silver lipstick and the triangular face stickers) and leave no doubt as to when this was made. This film is truly jaw-dropping. I am not especially fond of musicals, but love cheesy movies of all varieties. This is an especially runny, excrementally smelly Camembert, putting it near the top of the bad movie menu of fine cheeses.

""The Apple"" is highly recommended for anyone who believes they have seen a film so bad that there is not one worse.

2063469,5,B00026L7P4,"I've liked this clever film enormously since it first came out in 1980.  I've also read all the bad reviews which said it's awful, a bomb, ""so bad it's good""! Just another indication that Americans have lost their sense of humor, and are too dimwitted to understand satire anymore. OF COURSE the ""acting is bad""- it's because this is a parody in rock opera form; NO ONE in the film is taking this seriously; albeit, there is a quasi-serious message, which you may or may not agree with, but it's there nonetheless: Big powerful evil guys, in the form of giant coporations, great wealth, power & fame, can seduce you and win for awhile, but goodness, virture, and simplicity will win in the end.  Your basic ""the meek shall inherit the Earth philosophy""!  Agree, don't agree, it's there anyway, and yet given in a casual, non-serious, playful, song & dance way.  It is all very cute, put together intelligently, with double entendres and symbolism everywhere that the producers literally beat you over the head with, with tongue in cheek!  But SO-O-O many people that have seen this movie have dismissed it too quickly and simply not gotten its cleverness, which is a shame.  I love the music, the voices are excellent, especially George Gilmour, who wrote many of the songs, and Pandi and Dandi (beautiful Grace Kennedy and Alan Love) are good traditional rock and rollers, owned by the evil, totalitarian, monster corporation which seeks to take over everything - like the old Soviet Union. The parallels are there, and this was 1980, before the ""evil empire"" fell, so the message of this move was right on point for the time, and continues to last to today, with others who wish to take away our freedoms and give us a totalitarian form of life - which THE APPLE resoundingly rejects, in humourous, musical, satiric form.  There are so many small parodies in the movie that I can't list them, and you see new ones every time you watch it.  This is also a story about love, which, as in every good romanctic story, shows that love conquers all.  It many be corny, and the message hokey, and the acting tongue in cheek, but it is an excellent movie on many levels that most people have not fully appreciated.  It's meant for you to laugh with it, and occasionally at it, to appreciate the music and sexy dance numbers, which also contribute to the sexy, materialistic, totalitarian message!  It's all there, in a very pleasant format, with performances credibly given considering what they were trying to do - all humor and parodies are difficult to pull off, and they did in this one that all too few people GOT. Vladek Sheybal is absolutely amazing in his tongue-in-cheek portryal of the devil who uses music and a large music corporation to take over everything and everyone, even taking over lovely, innocent Bibi (as the devil did to EVE in the garden of Eden, getting her to bite off a chunk of a similar apple then).  But unlike Adam, Alfi never folds, and sticks to his good-guy guns throughout the story, from square one, and is the one person, with virtue, unending love, and a lot of romantic music in his pocket, winning the day, converting Bibi back, and forcing a mythilogical, fantasied ""second coming"" (""Mr. Tops"") which takes all the good people away to some utopia.  As I said, the story may be hokey, but no more so than those in the Bible.  You may not agree with it, but it gives you a good ride, playfully and musically, with some great tongue-in-cheek satiric bits.  Those of you who liked it - now you know why.",1156204800,2,3535,4.642628205128205

The acting is, at times, a little over the top, but that's intentional.

The musical numbers are varied and many.  While clearly a lot of effort was put into them, they are not particularly memorable.  The same could be said for the songs, which left barely an impression at all once the movie was over.  But while they're going on, you can enjoy them.

Sometime in the future, 1994 to be exact, the world is controlled by an evil music agent, Mr. Boogalow, who somehow has Big Brother-like control over the police and society in general.  Everyday at a designated time everyone, and I mean everyone, must dance for 60 minutes to his BIM music.  Also all people must wear a reflective triangle sticker on their face.

Folksy singers Bibi & Alphie don't belong in the BIM-tastic world so Boogalow buys off Bibi and turns her into a BIM superstar.  Alphie rejects Boogalow's offer and fights to free Bibi and get her to join a hippy cult with him.  She does and just when Boogalow and the evil police are taking them away God, I mean, Mr. Topps rides out of the clouds in his flying Rolls Royce and whisks them away to Heaven.

The one thing I forgot to mention is about every 5 minutes there's a massive overcrowded musical number that makes you cry out ""What the Hell is going on!?  My brain hurts!""  Needless to say I quite enjoyed this movie.  It's gonna be a few years before I could sit through it again though.

The DVD has a good picture and sound, but where are the extras?  A trailer? That's it?  What makes it even more insulting is the trailer had multiple scenes that weren't in the movie.

When Copernicus first asserted that the sun, not Earth, was the center of the universe, he attained immediate pariah-status. Yet time proved that he was correct and a brilliant visionary. Those who disparage this starkly beautiful film are those who disparaged Copernicus so many years ago, witness and myopic in their world view. Golan has created a world that is uncanny in its resonance to today's post-Clintonian United States, where corporations choose what music Americans will enjoy and where police officers ""break into dance,"" a subversive symbol of the racial injustice that is today's police force. Dancing nuns? Nostradamus would be proud that Golan could foresee, way back in 1980, the ""dance"" around the facts of child molestation within the Catholic church. This is truly a tour de force of film verite. In its own brilliant, pitiless way, The Apple evokes our own age in its quest for glitter and success. The Apple doesn't moralize over the fate of the beautiful Mr. Boogelow, who loved so unwisely, although his last song is a thoroughly chilling comment on his life and the world in which he lived (1980).

Catherine Mary Stewart, starlet of The Apple, is a poet and with The Apple as her canvass, this film is as great a cycle of poems as has been written in this century by any poet. This film is so rich and varied that it is difficult to convey how much there is to it. Cleverly constructed, there are hints and cross-references to hidden (and obvious) meanings throughout. Truth and falsity, reality and illusion are constant throughout, side by side, often difficult to differentiate. The Apple is a highly literate, ingenious and intelligent theatrical entertainment, probably cinema's most accomplished screenplay. But while one must respect the screenwriter's wit and erudition, it strikes me as the work of a brilliant impersonator rather than a dramatist with his own authentic voice.

2063492,5,B00026L7P4,"Wow, I saw this too on The Movie Channel (in Calgary, a bounced signal off the mountains, from some isolated town that broadcast it to its residence, was received on our old style antenna on the roof, but only IF we left the aluminum garage door open). Wierdest story you want hear, and how I was able to find this signal.
Anyway, THE APPLE .. true about it having some large problems in tackiness and some bad acting in a couple spots (which is forgivable except the line or two given was SO bad). Besides that I just loved 80% of the music; I was in love with Catherine Mary Stewart (a Canadian from Edmonton).  The cast was actually excellent and they were good. I was crazy about the storyline and message (hope) etc. and the supremacy of good.  But then again, maybe I'm a bit of a refuge from the 60s as the movie says (or a wanna be).
HEY FELLOW WITH THE MP3 .. I looked and looked and looked for the soundtrack. Give me your email so we can connect.  Oh and widescreen, hurray; no more long scenes with a -talking lamp- with no people.
There are a ton of talented young people in this.  One of the dancers was from General Hospital at the time (Anna from GH; I'm talking 1987, she also had a short lived series with the fellow from Soap).  Anyway you see these people all over the place. And the people who played Andy and Pandy ... if that was their voices, wow!
Some REALLY, really good songs, and a couple really poorly done, I suspect poorly recorded mostly.  The company I believed turned into Cannon Pictures.
You have to be in a certain mindset to catch onto this movie, but it has lots of amazing things.
Anyway, it has been a movie that I have constantly comeback to thinking about, and you cannot say that about many movies.  I recommend it.",1095465600,,1759,4.3121212121212125
2063493,5,B00026L7P4,"Ok, if you're looking for intellectual brain stimulating cinema, this ain't it, but if you're looking for an escape full of camp, you might want to check out this movie. Granted it is dated (1980), but it is visually stimulating fun. This flick has everything from a scene in Hell to an orgy room scene to a sort of modern day rapture of a Hippy commune. Where else ya gonna find a movie with all this??  You can also think of it as the love child of Rocky Horror and Xanadu (both of which are favorite movies of mine). No, there were no Oscars for the acting, directing or the score, but then again, is that really what you're seeking?

2063494,4,B00026L7P4,"FINALLY!  Relesed on DVD.  Someone at MGM finally woke up, smelled the coffee and saw that the lineups of 300+ people for this film at the Egyptian Theatre might meen that people were now ready to ""take a bite"" of THE APPLE.
Sometimes describing this film to people, they think you're might be daydreaming, and in a time where pre-fab karaoke is being rammed down our throats (Ala the ""American Idol"" franchise), ""The Apple"" seems moreso apparent with an odd reflection of the music industry.  As a Canadian, I liked how Alfie and Bibi were from Moosejaw, Saskatchewan!
The songs are cornbally, George Clinton might have done them for blow, but trust me folks, you'd rather hear these tracks than ""Clay Aiken sings the Caligula Soundtrack"" or ""Billy Clippert sings Cole Porter"".

I have never seen a bad movie more exuberantly made. The songs! The choreography! The dialogue! The acting! The sets!

2063496,5,B00026L7P4,"This is the Holy of Holies of BAD CINEMA, the pristine junk that Ed Wood would have produced if someone had given him a blank check to make a musical. Since Ed never made it to the musical scene, we have to settle for the contributions of two of Ed's equals in tacky tastelessness, yes the Cannon Boyz themselves, Menahem Golan and Youram Globus.

This cinematic canker sore MUST be ""scene"" to be believed. Especially the parts where Vladek Sheybal, (yes, Col Kronsteen and Dr Jackson from UFO) sings. Well, I guess Telly Savalas was too busy doing Vegas gigs to appear in this hyperventilated hokeyfest. Let's just say that Alice Cooper has nothing to fear from this guy.

As for the ""ending"". it is a pastiche of Grand gruyere as the incredible Mr. Topps, played by Joss Ackland, all of a sudden appears in a suit that makes him look like a pimp on Sesame Street, complete with a funky cheesy negative of an AMC Ambassador that all of a sudden has thousands of hippies walking into it for their ride to meet Mr. Xenu.

2063497,5,B00026L7P4,"What more can I add?  Reviewer CC Incalzini says it all really - very good review!

I'd just like to add that it is great to finally have this film on a 'proper' DVD, I've seen all the bootleg copies for sale on eBay (and believe it or not DVD's too) - buy from Amazon, coz at least then you know you're getting a 'real' copy and not a bootleg! - MGM have done a stonkingly good job of restoring this print (if that's the right word) the awful pan and scan on the video has gone, and because of that you get to see the whole movie.  I finally get to see Vladek Sheybal (Mr Boogalow) singing all the way through 'The Master' whereas before I didn't.  This actor is great in the movie as he normally plays screen villains and it was great to see him do something different.  All in all, a great effort.  Now can we turn our attention to getting The Apple soundtrack released on CD (instead of bootleg copies of the album as seen on eBay) - that would complete the set wouldn't it? - why are you running away - what's wrong with you?",1093305600,7,1030,4.099502487562189
2063498,5,B00026L7P4,"Since a handful of well-attended screenings have popped up in L.A., Boston, Austin, Seattle and San Francisco in the past two years, this movie has been coveted by all who enjoy a good bad movie. So coveted that bootlegs of questionable quality have been gobbled up on eBay. But now it's here, a bright, shiny print on DVD! This movie can't be missed. Its horrible acting, flimsy plot, unrelentingly bad music and lyrics, cheeseball costumes and, best of all, its earnestness, put it at the top of my list of camp demanding repeat viewings. It's also camp deserving of a wider audience. If you can't laugh at a man walking around in an Amazing Stories robe and silver G-string while antagonizing a wide-eyed music industry protege, what can you laugh at? If you can't appreciate a full-scale underworld scene (with music reminiscent of the worst of ""Rocky Horror"") in which one guy is wearing a mask with an extra face on it, what's wrong with you? These are just some of the subtle qualities that make this movie so great. Others: An evil overlord/music executive whose offices appear to be in the Kansas City airport. A guy with perpetual cameltoe. A cross between jazz hands and spirit fingers that passes for choreography. A surgical team interrupted by a mandatory exercise period in which the patient even gets a workout. A baffling scene in which a hippie commune gets sucked into the heavens by a white tux-clad guy named Mr. Topps. It's just jaw-droppingly awful ... but a lot of fun.",1090886400,53,1493,4.746153846153846

8022731,5,B00026L7P4,"The 1980 cult classic ""The Apple"" has been referred to as the Mount Everest of bad movie musicals. While I agree with that sentiment, that doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching. Should you have a penchant for so bad it's great cinema but have yet to witness the power of rock in 1994 by way of ""The Apple"", this excellent blu-ray release is the ideal way to do it. The movie is audacious, campy, energetic, fun and infectious. However it also is by no means a good movie. It is the best kind of bad movie in which everybody from the director on down tried their hardest to make a good film but failed completely. Yet it transcends its badness to have become something else entirely different over the last several years which is a bona-fide cult classic of glitzy camp. I simply could not properly process what I was seeing the first time I saw ""The Apple"". It truly has to be seen to be believed!

This long awaited blu-ray release presents the film in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is based on a new HD scan done in 2016 specifically for this release. The movie looks amazing and blows the ancient MGM DVD away without breaking a sweat. Detail is immaculate and no digital scrubbing appears to have been done. Colors look bold and skin tones accurate. Simply put this is possibly the best ""The Apple"" has ever looked and kudos to Kino Lorber/Scorpion for taken the time to do a brand new HD master versus just recycling an ancient master used for the old DVD release. English subtitles are not included for the hearing impaired despite seeming like they were supposed to have been included based on the options listed on the back of the cover.

Sound is presented in 2 channel stereo master audio and sounds great with superb definition particularly during the many musical numbers.

There are only 2 extras included on this disc but they are great ones. Catherine Mary Stewart who starred as Bibi in the film sits down for a 47 minute interview focusing not only on ""The Apple"" which was her first film but other subsequent notable career highlights. Still gorgeous after all of these years along with being as engaging and charismatic as she always was, it is a lot of informative fun for fans. She also contributes an equally fun commentary track with a well organized moderator that contains a ton more insight into the film.

I should also mention that this release features the theatrical cut and not the legendary preview screening cut which has unfortunately gone missing in the hands of an unknown collector after a few public screenings in recent years. This preview cut features an additional song and various scene extensions.

""The Apple"" won't be for everybody but remains a miscalculated cinematic blast for the brave.  Fans will be more than pleased with this blu-ray release and newcomers can check out the film in superb HD clarity. Highly recommended and remember to do the BIM!",1499904000,4,2911,4.67578125
8022732,5,B00026L7P4,"I never thought I'd see the day when this glorious mess of a film would be released on Blu-ray. The picture quality is superb and the soundtrack is clearer than I've ever heard. Throw in a fun commentary by Catherine Mary Stewart plus a 45-minute interview with her and you end up with quite a nice release for the price. While it would have been wonderful to see the elusive excised scenes, Scorpion Releasing did make an effort to obtain them and failed to do so because of a dastardly thief who made off with the only known print containing them. I really can't complain about the Blu-ray. If you love The Apple, you'll love this disc. If you don't get enjoyment out of outrageous but entertaining film failures then keep on shopping.
