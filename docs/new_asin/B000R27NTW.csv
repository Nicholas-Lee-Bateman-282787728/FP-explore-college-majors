There are a few lessons that feel like they needed to move a little slower, but those were still effective with some repetition.  It could use better navigation within the lessons to make repetitions of small sections easier.  I have a strong musical background, but I honestly think this would have been useful even if I didn't.  There is no need to be familiar with music terminology or sheet music or really anything to get started.",1430956800,,521,4.681318681318682
8198337,5,B000R27NTW,"I wanted to buy the volume 1 of the keyboard series because it seemed expensive especially if the DVDs were not really good but I took the plunge and bought the beginners series of the Musicademy Beginner's Worship Keyboard course. I am so glad I did.  It was worth every penny.  I was struggling playing melody with a piano teacher for quite a while.  So when I started with the DVDs, I was so impressed how quickly I was progressing and how much I was enjoying it.  Needless to say, I since then bought the intermediate and the advanced and they are equally top notch.  Tim Martin is a great teacher and the pace is just right.  The website is full of information [...].  I also started guitar and got their DVDs as well.  They are first class videos and their customer service is outstanding.
