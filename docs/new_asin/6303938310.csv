7856202,4,6303938310,"Okay, maybe I'm just a little emotional today but I just watched the movie and I have to tell you, I have a headache from trying NOT to cry harder than I was!  The movie does have some slow points but they aren't senseless. In fact most help add to the emotional quality of the movie.  The only part of the movie that brings the viewer back to the fact that this is only movie is he ending minutes. but I won't spoil any moments. As for the boy robot, I don't believe that there could have been a better actor cast for the lead part than Haley Joel Osment.  He practically dares the audience not to feel his pain and feeling of mis' (misunderstand, misdirection, etc.).  In my opinion, this movie is worth the time and money.",1002844800,,725,4.231884057971015
