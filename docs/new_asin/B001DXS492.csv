8295391,3,B001DXS492,"This is a part historical documentary about Valley Forge and part ""please give to the foundation as we are low on money."" As a fan of historical preservation this doesn't bother me. Some of the more interesting historical details were: (1) winter wars were rarely feasible because getting supplies to men on wagon wheels through icy roads and storms wasn't feasible. As a result most soldiers could look forward to no fighting during the winter months.; (2) Valley Forge had men with black limbs awaiting amputations and men standing on their hats in the snow because they had no shoes which led visiting officials to finally finance the troops with food and better supplies.; (3) Martha Washington, an heiress of great wealth, came to Valley Forge and comforted the troops with prayers and sitting by their bedsides as they lay dying or ill.; and (4) Von Steuben, the mysterious Prussian officer, taught the troops how to utilize their firepower and maneuver to get more shots off as well as hit the flanks of their opponents and get their cavalry on to the field faster. He had this gruff personality but the troops loved him.

There's an analogy of comparing Valley Forge as the darkest time for the American Revolution and tying that into our own lives. It could have done more on the History end but it was somewhat good overall.

8295392,5,B001DXS492,"""Valley Forge"" is a thinly-disguised plea for monetary support to restore decaying buildings at Valley Forge.  Nonetheless, that does not detract from its interesting and valuable nature.

Valley Forge is where the American Dream of freedom almost died; instead, it was rekindled and went on to victory over England five years later at Yorktown.

Prior to marching into Valley Forge, the Continental Army had lost two important battles (Brandywine and Germantown), and the troops were dispirited.  The cold, poor food, and their worn-out clothing didn't help.  Washington, however, was an inspirational leader - one of his first acts was to put his men to making shelters (1,000 huts, with 12 men each), and then inviting representatives of the Continental Congress to see the troops' plight (eg. sentries without shoes, men thin as rails).

Washington's pleas brought help, and monies became available, though still quite limited.  Sanitation was a major concern, and disease was abetted by the limited food.  (An estimated 2,000 men died that winter.)  Martha Washington joined her husband and spent her days with the sick.

Another major problem was that Washington's army was that in name only - basically a collection of state militias that lacked common commands or fighting skills.  Luckily, Benjamin Franklin had met Baron von Steuben from Frederick the Great's staff.  He arrived at Valley Forge in Feb., 1978, asked to review the troops, and convinced Washington of his value through Steuben's subsequent observations.  Washington appointed von Steuben a general and put him in charge of training.  Von Steuben proceeded to build both morale and fighting skills.

Not until the 1820s did Americans show interest in the Valley Forge site.  In 1977, administration was transferred to the National Park Service.  Archeology efforts continue on the site.",1225411200,7,1860,5.3367697594501715
