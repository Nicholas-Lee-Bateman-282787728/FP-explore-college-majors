2560324,2,B000FC2FUQ,"While there was no problem with the OUTSIDE of the dvd case, or with the 2 dvds themselves, the plastic disc holder INSIDE was broken, as was the little plastic clips that hold it in place. Thr dvds played well in spite of this.",1368489600,,228,4.204545454545454
2560325,3,B000FC2FUQ,"I have no problem with the movies in general, but the disc were sent to me in a state that will require professional cleaning.

Had they been in better shape, I would have rated them at least a 4 star.",1362441600,,201,4.025
2560326,5,B000FC2FUQ,"If you're looking for Academy Award winning performances, you'll need to keep looking. If you're looking for fun, sexy, action with some of Hollywood's best actors, and don't take the films too seriously, this is the double feature for you.",1362182400,,240,5.025
2560327,5,B000FC2FUQ,just wanted to give fellow buyers a heads up that only one of these movies is in widescreen. both movies however great.,1312329600,3,119,4.454545454545454
2560328,5,B000FC2FUQ,"""Mr & Mrs Smith"" is the movie that put Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together.  Literally.  Soon after making this film, they got married in real life.  Little doubt then whether or not there was chemistry between them in the character portrayals during this movie.  It is two highly professional and in demand assassins accidentally discovering they are married to each other.  This movie takes off on a bender, beyond anything ""War of the Roses"" with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas brought to the screen.  ""Mr & Mrs Smith"" is easy to enjoy.
""True Lies"" stars Arnold Swarzenegger and the incredible Jamie Lee Curtis.  This movie goes off the deep end in non-sense scenarios, but heck if you want realism, just watch documentaries.  Jamie Lee Curtis does a dance in this film that made my socks go up and down on my legs so fast it burned all the hair off.  This movie has mayhem and body count, adultery, high society situations, and comic relief - all in a fair balance.  Arnold is a highly professional and sought after private intelligence agent that has more skills than Popeil's Kitchen Magician.
If you're fortunate enough to be considering buying these two comedy / action / drama films in this combo pack, you're not going to be disappointed in either film.  Buy it this way.  You can even buy it used in this combo pack format, and end up getting both films for under $5 each that way.  How can you lose?  I recommend both movies as each being worthy of 5 stars in their own right, and this combo pack is the best way to get them affordably.  If you don't like movies with assassins, don't like secret agents, and you don't like either main actor or either main actress, you might want to buy something else, though.
Some of the reviewers on Amazon could go to a Barnum and Bailey Circus and then complain because there were acrobats and lion tamers performing. Adventurous others try peanut butter on bologna with black olives on pumpernickel bread, and wonder why it isn't delicious.  Everybody knows not to use pumpernickel bread, but they try it anyway.  The point is, the movies in this combo pack are well cast, and the story lines are entertaining even if they hadn't been as superbly portrayed.  This is a win-win right here people.  Heads up.",1293062400,,2265,4.6457286432160805
2560329,5,B000FC2FUQ,"My husband and I love action flicks like Mr. & Mrs. Smith and True Lies. In fact, those are two of our favorites, along with Sahara, so we were excited to see this double feature pack. It's a great price, and it helps us save some space by having both discs in one package.

Both of these movies are great, if you're into semi-cheesy action/action-comedy movies.",1281398400,,362,4.484848484848484
2560330,3,B000FC2FUQ,"I thought Mr. & Mrs. Smith was a lousy attempt to ""remake"" True Lies.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith is so horrible.  For a movie that was supposed to springboard the entire ""Bragelina"" fad, it really was a lame duck.  These two had no chemistry together and there weren't any real steamy love/sex scenes between ""Bragelina"".  I guess they had to cut ""romance"" out to give it a PG-13 rating, but wasn't that the big draw to see this movie, the steamy chemistry?  However, this movie had no problem killing and blowing things up in order to attain its PG-13 rating.  I realize it was an action movie, but some of the scenes/stunts were ridiculous and so fake looking. The action scene with the mini-van is a perfect example of what I am talking about.  Mr. & Mrs. Smith was also a very long two hours that seemed like it didn't know where it wanted to go.  Avoid if you don't want to waste 120 minutes of your life.

As for True Lies, this movie was well done for an action film.  A solid Arnold movie and provided some great action, humor and was able to still be fun.  I thought it was a great ""summer blockbuster"" when it came out.  In other words, it knew it was an action movie and didn't try to be anything else, and today it is still a pretty solid action movie.  There is a great cast in True Lies; featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger (of course), Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold (who is really funny in this movie), Bill Paxton (who I normally don't like but was funny in this movie) Tia Carrere, Charlton Heston, Art Malik and a young Eliza Dushku.  In addition, True Lies is able to perform the action movie justice with an R rating.  I am just saying.

Since Mr. & Mrs. Smith is bad carbon copy of True Lies, I would just watch latter.  Honestly, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a total rip off of True Lies and it is executed poorly. (There are some ""stolen"" ideas in the realm of cinema that can work, for instance ""Mac & Me"" stealing from ""E.T."", well....uh maybe that was a bad example.)  It just didn't happen with the ""Bragelina"" machine.  Further food for thought; has either one of these two really made a great film or major blockbuster since this drivel?

Consequently, the mind boggles to why the put both of these movies as a double feature.  I suppose so a viewer can watch them in juxtaposition and see how the Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a poverty-stricken attempt to recapture and/or cash in on the magic of True Lies.",1197417600,,2405,4.3355704697986575
8120576,5,B000FC2FUQ,"Bought it for True Lies because I love it...but Mr. and Mrs. Smith was also adorable.  I forget what I paid, but I do recall thinking it was a bargain for this double feature.",1512777600,,175,4.147058823529412

8120583,1,B000FC2FUQ,"Mr. & Mrs. Smith was painfully disappointing.  The plot was stupid and never satisfactorily explained why the husband and wife had to kill each other.  They were both paid assassins competing for jobs with absolutely no redeeming qualities, and a lousy marriage which made it depressing instead of romantic.
True Lies on the other hand is one of my all time favorites.  It is funny, crazy, and entertaining from start to finish.",1417910400,,428,4.916666666666667
