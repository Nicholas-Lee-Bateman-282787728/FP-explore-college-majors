8109594,3,B000EGYWOU,"Meh, it was a disappointing rendition of St. Joan of Arc's life. Skipped very important details of her life and was extremely rushed and short. Had I actually watched the movie before buying this DVD, I wouldn't have gotten it. My young girls love St Joan and they didn't seem impressed with this movie either",1480464000,,309,4.636363636363637
8109595,4,B000EGYWOU,"a good introduction to Jeanne D'Arc, that will help get kids more interested in the Saints and maybe the parents, this is a real person with a well documented short life.",1351641600,,170,4.516129032258065
