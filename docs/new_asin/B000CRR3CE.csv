2471200,5,B000CRR3CE,"Nero Wolfe -- the agrophobic, orchid-growing gourmet with a penchant for solving the most complicated puzzles of all (those involving the complex motivations and machinations of humans)-- may be the world's greatest (fictional) detective of the 20th century. Even so, he couldn't do it without the smooth and street smart Archie Goodwin. Reading these mysteries is always a treat, and purists may argue that the book will always be better than anything made for the big or small screen. However, I must differ, which is something considering I used to be a reporter and one of the subjects I'm certified to teach is secondary English. In other words, I'm the type people would expect to be one of the aforementioned purists.

Maury Chakin (who does an admirable job playing the eccentric and egocentric Nero Wolfe) and Timothy Hutton (who just about steals the show as the debonair and determined Archie Goodwin) so skillfully execute their respective roles that the viewer may feel that he or she has walked into one of Rex Stout's books.

The rhythm, the dialogue, and the narration are all faithful to the author's voice. The pity of this series is that it is limited to 20 of the 73 stories Stout penned using Wolfe and Goodwin. It's my understanding that the series didn't produce the revenue expected by the powers-that-be at A&E, which I attribute to the erratic scheduling rather than the quality of the episodes.

Not only do I highly recommend seeing this series, but also reading Stout's Nero Wolfe mysteries. If you do both, you will probably reach the same conclusions as I have: Stout's mysteries are intriguing, multilayered intellectual puzzles that are consistently entertaining and challenging, and the A&E series starring Hutton and Chaykin are the supreme screen adaptations of this skilled and underappreciated American writer. When I read a Nero Wolfe mystery that wasn't filmed by Hutton and Chaykin, I still visualize them saying and doing what Stout had Wolfe and Goodwin saying and doing.",1152057600,50,2014,5.042042042042042
2471201,4,B000CRR3CE,"I loved the language and the writing throughout this whole series.  In my opinion the series came to life when Timothy Hutton took over as director and executive producer.  There was something lacking in the pilot, but the rest of the episodes had a spark that drew me in and had me longing to see the next episode.  It's a shame that intelligent television doesn't make it today.",1151366400,26,380,4.5588235294117645
2471202,5,B000CRR3CE,"This series is just a joy from beginning to end. The cast work together well (especially Hutton and Chaykin), the scripts are witty and engage your brain, the sets and locations are impeccably filmed and the DVD transfer is decent. I am normally very much a ""watch once"" person, but I found myself watching the same episodes over again just to enjoy the ""eye-candy"" and the subtle nuances of the interactions between the characters.

In case you don't know, an unusual feature of this series is that the same core actors appear in all the episodes, but some are playing different roles each episode. We found that just added to the fun, but some folks might find it irritating, so be aware. Also look out for the use of colour - the series uses specific shades of green, red, and yellow all the way through.

I don't understand why this complete edition is cheaper than either of the two separate series. Sure, the DVDs are in slim-line cases, but I actually prefer those. The video quality is identical to the more expensive versions (I already had series 1 so I compared the two). Given the many hours of pleasure you will get from it, this complete edition is a fabulous bargain.

If A&E ever release these as widescreen HD DVDs I will likely buy them over again.

The tragedy is that A&E canned the show after the second season, so there will be no more Nero Wolfe.",1148601600,253,1369,4.530364372469635
2471203,5,B000CRR3CE,"The ""Nero Wolfe"" TV series (2001-2002)  is brilliant - casting, colors, sound and scripts. Producers Michael Jaffe, Timothy Hutton, and Howard Braunstein did a superb job bringing Rex Stout's stories  to the screen.  Maury Chaykin, as Nero Wolfe, and Timothy Hutton, as Archie Goodwin, along with an excellent supporting cast - Colin Fox, Bill Smitrovich, Conrad Dunn, Kari Matchett, Saul Rubinek, R.D. Reid, Fulvio Cesere, Trent McMullen, and Francie Swift to name a few -  do an exceptional job portraying  Stout's cherished characters.

The ""Nero Wolfe"" DVDs  have some extras (though fans of the series would be happier with more).  Included with the set are:  ""The Golden Spiders,"" the 2000 TV movie which led to the series,  ""The Making of Nero Wolfe,"" a short documentary which offers interviews with Timothy Hutton, Maury Chaykin, and others involved in the production of this marvelous series, and a ""bonus""  widescreen version of ""The Silent Speaker.""  To include the widescreen ""bonus"" of ""The Silent Speaker"" as an extra is ironic since all of the the episodes were shot in widescreen and should have been reproduced as such on the DVDs.  And to make the set truly ""mega"" it would have been most gratifying if the European versions of the episodes were included in the set.

The producers choose some of Rex Stout's favorite Nero Wolfe stories for adaptation to the screen.  ""The Doorbell Rang,"" directed by Timothy Hutton, is the premier episode of the series.  Nero Wolfe takes on ""the big fish"" J. Edgar Hoover to earn the biggest fee of his career. With the able assistance of Archie Goodwin, his intrepid legman, Wolfe triumphs over the F.B.I., earns his client's admiration (Mrs. Bruner, played by Debra Monk: ""Is there anything you can't do?""), and solves a murder for the cops along the way.  ""Death of  a Doxy,"" ""Champagne for One,"" and ""The Mother Hunt"" are a few more of the well know Nero Wolfe stories included in the series.  It's a great sorrow to fans of both this magnificent series and Rex Stout's wonderful books that the show was abruptly canceled before some of the other favorites, such as ""In The Best Families"" could be adapted for television audiences.

Five Stars plus Five Stars to Mr. Jaffe and Mr. Hutton for giving  Nero Wolfe fans a series worthy of  Stout's tales.",1141603200,280,2308,4.894329896907217
2471224,3,B000CRR3CE,"I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they even put out a box set of this truly great detective series, since it inexplicably lasted only two seasons.  But they obviously made virtually no effort in producing this.  There is no list of episode names.  Disc 1 is missing the pilot.  Though the quality of the picture and audio is good, some episodes have distracting white bars dancing at the top of the screen, showing the tech who converted these from tape to DVD was paying little attention to detail.

2471257,2,B000CRR3CE,"Conditional first review:
Each disk case has a notice on the front that advises the level of violence in the episodes, so that is a positive for the series if you are concerned about young persons viewing them. The current rating of only 2 stars is due to the condition of the set which just arrived. There are 4 cases with 2 disks per case. Three of the four cases had loose disks which were scratched. I will update my review after viewing some of the episodes.
Conditional review update:
I keep my initial review to only 2 stars due to both the packaging of the set as well as the production of the series.
In addition to the disks being loose in the cases, the first disk case was poorly put together in that it was a black case and the others were clear. This in itself would not have been an issue except for the episodes' synopsis being on the back of the outer cover page. Since I don't have X-RAY vision the page had to be removed for each episode to read the back. I resorted to photo copying the back of the page to keep from potential damage to it. I was able to view all episodes, so the scratched disks weren't severely damaged.
The stories themselves were good, but that is where I now state my disappointment with the series itself.
My first issue with it is the use of a repertory cast for non-recurring roles. An Internet article on the series said the use of the repertory was for controlling costs...and it showed. Also, memorable remarks about some suspect characters in various episodes carried into other episodes they appeared in. For instance, one character in an early episode was described as ""The guy with no chin""; then there was the female that was the ""doxy"" in the episode entitled ""The Doxy"". I kept remembering those descriptions in subsequent episodes. The ""guy with no chin"" was the one I most remembered in the episodes.
I also got tired of females that screeched out their indignation or anger, especially if they were supposedly prominent persons being interviewed. It was a lot like watching Little Theater productions with non-professional actors. Over-acting is a mild term for it.
I also feel the set decor and costuming were rather over-done and most likely cost more than the whole repertory cast itself. I've toured European palaces and art galleries that weren't as tacky and full of ""stuff"" as much of the set decorations in this series.
The costuming also was obviously more costly since the costumers said they made about 1000 costumes for each season. The head costumer did try to copy vintage clothing, but he admits he used ""modern"" fabrics to achieve the colors he wanted. Modern fabrics mean synthetics with synthetic dyes. Synthetic fabric and dyes don't present the same color as earlier dyed fabrics. Not the same as I know from living in the 50's and 6O's. Especially during, and soon after, the end of WWII when lavish clothing was about half as over-decorated as this series presents. View some mystery movies made during that period and you'll see the difference.
The way the make-up people did their best to make the repertory characters look ""different"" was amusing. Gluing a lavish mustache on one actor wasn't really out of line since he was a barber in the episode, but plopping a dark, curly bushy wig...but not even a hint of a hair where sideburns would exist, on a totally bald actor was laughable. They also used an oversized hat to ""disguise"" him in another episode where he wasn't a suspect. That was pretty feeble. Women got off relatively easier with changing hair colors, glasses and even mousy clothing.
Finally I was most disappointed in the dearth of humor. I have to admit I vastly preferred the William Conrad portrayal of Nero Wolfe in his series which sadly only lasted one season due to scheduling of the show. There was much more humor and insight into Wolfe's mania about his orchid collecting. His food mania was also more humorous and obvious, which gave more credence to his bulky physique.
I also preferred the acting of William Conrad and Lee Horsley as the principles. They had more character with them alone that the entire casting of this A&E offering.",1507680000,,4147,4.682191780821918

2471274,5,B000CRR3CE,"If you've been a guest at the brownstone on West 35th, you may have a love/hate/love relationship with these dvds.  The short explanation is that you won't get closer to Nero and Archie in media than these vignettes will bring you, and you'll love that, but nothing will ever be close enough to the images and dialects we keep in our imaginations, not to mention the mouth-watering experience of turning a page to discover what Fritz has on the menu each night, so we sigh, and still - love again - we treasure these adaptations, so colorful, so true to NYC in the 40's and 50's, and we take our delight where we can find it. Rex Stout's narrative is a very hard act to follow. Give credit to Timothy Hutton.

The repertoire company of supporting actors is hugely talented and it starts to be fun watching what they can do with the many and varied parts they play, the chance to see the two priniples and Inspector Cramer sparring with and respecting one another is altogether welcome, the tone coming through is so nearly perfect, that you'll watch them again and again.  I've seen them and shown them half a dozen times ... then I went to the proper address last time I was in the City.  Not the one located in the River, the other one.

The plaque out front reads:  ""On this site stood the elegant brownstone of the corpulent fictional private detective Nero Wolfe. With his able assistant Archie Goodwin, Mr. Wolfe raised orchids and dined well, while solving over seventy cases as recorded by Rex Stout from 1934-1975.""

2471282,5,B000CRR3CE,"This deserves 5 stars, and it gets them.

I was and am a HUGE Nero Wolf fan, to the degree that at one time I owned almost all of his novels in paperback.  I watched the series when it was on A&E way back when, so when I saw the DVDs, I just HAD to get them.  I remembered the cases that made it to the program, and the scripts were for all practical purposes Rex Stout's writing verbatim.  The fact that I recalled how many of the cases came out did not in the least stop me from enjoying seeing the words on the page brought to life.  Indeed, it was like getting reacquainted with some treasured old friends.

The casting for the series was excellent.  All of the characters liooked exactly like I had imagined them -- all except Inspector Kramer.  I always pictured Kramer as a tall, debonair gentleman with a full head of gray hair, and in the series he was a short guywho was 10,000% New York City!!

2471312,4,B000CRR3CE,"Pros:
Unlike other efforts, this series is set in the 1940s-1950s with beautiful period pieces. Wolfe fans should enjoy seeing the clothes, mansions and cars which they have only been able to picture in their own minds.

Stories are faithful to the books, unlike the 1981 series which butchered the stories to get them to fit in 45-minute episodes in modern times. (The 1981 series can be seen on Youtube.) The brilliance of the books is largely due to Stout's wonderful use of language which is often retained in the scripts of this set.

The cast for most of the regular characters (Fritz, Cramer, Stebbins) is outstanding.

Cons:
Maury Chaykin, as Nero Wolfe, looks the part well enough, but BELLOWS at least as often as he talks in a normal voice. This alone is enough to subtract one star from my rating as it is hard to sit through his near-constant and usually inappropriate shouting. (PICTURE EVERY OTHER LINE OF THIS REVIEW WRITTEN IN UPPERCASE TO SEE WHAT I MEAN!!!!!!) I never cared for William Conrad as Wolfe. Conrad's idea of portraying a genius was to talk very deliberately and distinctly all the time, which sounded stilted and phony, but at least, as with Wolfe in the books, Conrad rarely bellowed.

Stout describes Archie as a tough guy, ""muscular both in appearance and in movement"". He is also an accomplished boxer who knows that a kidney punch can be just as effective as a punch to the jaw and a lot easier on the knuckles. Archie is also described by women in the books as ""VERY handsome"" and as one who is able to get any woman he wants, from stars of the stage to models to rooms full of beautiful typists. -- My personal opinion is that Timothy Hutton, who may be a fine actor and was much better than Lee Horsley of the 1981 series, simply doesn't fit this description. There are plenty of good actors around who look tough/intimidating as well as very handsome.

The idea of using the same actors for different characters in each episode was misguided, in my opinion. Some of the actors were very good, but I didn't think that any of the women were ""very beautiful"", as described in the books, until some new actresses were introduced in the 5th DVD. Most disappointing was the actress who portrayed Lily Rowan.

Despite the negatives, this set is still worth the cost for a Wolfe fan. I got the full series in a set on here for $37. Even as a huge fan who has read all the books, I don't know that I would pay much more for this set, but it is worth that amount to me.",1488672000,,2500,4.483516483516484

You can have fun with trivia by identifying the make, model, and year of all the restored cars (and one or two trucks).  See if you can catch the mid-thirties Cord Beverly.

2471326,5,B000CRR3CE,Great seller! The set exceeded my expectations.  The best adaption of Rex Stout's masterful mystery series ever produced. The rare mystery series that can be rewatched over and over do too the witty dialogue and the wonderful acting of the leads. The sets are incredible and the atmosphere created fills very much like the 1950s. Tis a great shame that more were never produced. Mr Chaykin was and is the enbodiment of Nero Wolfe and is greatly  missed. Buy this set you will never have regrets.,1483747200,3,495,4.744186046511628

2471328,5,B000CRR3CE,"Realy good show, and they do it with great sets and period setting, lots of wit and interesting characters.

I could nitpick some elements like its kind of annoying durring the santa episode the actor does a weird voice like they were a long time smoker when it sounded beter in the 80's radio depication. And the re-using of actors for different characters who are not the regulars is interesting and has its ups and down.

My only complaint is that Wolfe yells too often. Although we know Wolfe sometimes ""bellowed"" at Archie when he became exasperated, he very seldom raised his voice to the visitors to his office; he relied instead on a vocal intensity that bent his listeners to his will. I thought most of the casting was good; Inspector Cramer especially seems spot-on.",1448928000,,487,4.879518072289157

I've been a fan of the books for a long time. Hutton's imagination rings true, and he fills in nice details in a plausible way so that I feel like I now know more about what Archie and Nero (and Fritz, and Cramer...) are ""really like"".
The ensemble cast, the same actors playing new roles in each story, gives the series an intimate, friendly feel, too.",1446681600,,371,4.391304347826087
2471399,5,B000CRR3CE,"My wife and I love this series - it's a shame they didn't make anymore.

The stories started out very true to the Stout books but just like Jeremy Britts Homes they started to deviate toward the end. The only thing I didn't like was re-using actors in different roles in different shows. But that was a minor personal opinion. The picture is great as is the sound. The DVDs arrived quickly in new condition. If you love Wolfe and Archie (as I do!) then you will love this show! It a shame it was only on the air for 2 years.

I would rate this series a very high 9.25 to 9.75 out of 10 - HIGHLY SATISFACTORY  as Wolfe would say!  Very highly recommended!",1445472000,,654,4.166666666666667

I love that they use the same actors playing different characters in other stories--that is fascinating to see the transformations. I was prepared to hate this series as a Nero Wolfe fan, i mean, its hard to bring a beloved book series to life, but kudos to this group.

2471411,5,B000CRR3CE,The only thing that would make this better than it already is - would be to have the ability to have subtitles with it - so much fast paced rich dialogue that sometimes bits and pieces can be lost in translation for the emotion that is being uttered. Beautiful wonderful work by the actors - script writers - scenes - sets - costumes - direction - it just goes on and on with such quality - also the rich graphics at the beginning of each show's credits.

Eight DVDs in four standard-size double-DVD plastic cases; all in a cardboard slipcase.

CONTENTS:
- The 2000 pilot ""Golden Spiders"" (90 minutes)
+ Season One (2001) complete = Eight episodes (four are double-length)
+ Season Two (2002) complete = Twelve episodes (four are double-length)
+ Bonus: ""The Making of Nero Wolfe"", a 22 minute introduction to the series (2001)
(see end of this review for the titles of each episode)

HOW TO VIEW THIS SERIES:
-- Step One: Insert DVD number 8 (Volume 4, Disc 2) into your player.
Watch the pilot: ""Golden Spiders"".
-- Step Two: Watch the 22 minute bonus ""The Making of Nero Wolfe"" (also on DVD 8), an excellent introduction to the remaining episodes in the series (no spoilers).
-- Step Three: Watch DVDs 1 through 7 in that order. When you come to DVD 7, you have a choice of aspect ratio for watching ""The Silent Speaker"" -

The series is presented in the 4:3 aspect ration which was standard for televisions in 2001.
Apparently it was also filmed in the wide-screen aspect ratio of 16:9, common to modern televisions.
But only one episode is presented in wide-screen, ""The Silent Speaker"" on DVD 8.
""The Silent Speaker"" can also viewed in the old 4:3 format on DVD 7.
If you have a modern TV set, by all means view it in wide-screen on DVD 8.

The pilot, ""Golden Spiders"", is rated M for Mature audiences, because of violence (Archie Goodwin actually tortures one of the bad guys to make him talk).
It is the best film in the series, and darker than the rest.
The remaining episodes (rated PG for Parental Guidance) are a bit flippant in tone, almost campy at times, but still rewarding for mystery buffs.
[a surprising number of Wolfe's clients are murdered after hiring him - seems like this would be bad for business.]

With Maury Chaykin as Nero Wolfe, and Timothy Hutton as Archie Goodwin,
this TV series was originally produced by the cable network A&E.
Hard to believe,
A&E has gone down-market considerably since then.
Back in 2000 they spent a lot of money and produced a quality product.
Set in 1950's New York, it was filmed in Toronto.
No problem. 2001 Toronto looked a lot like 1955 New York. Beautiful cinematography, sets, automobiles and costumes.

SUBTITLES?
Not actual subtitles, but the DVDs are closed-captioned in English.
Closed-Captioning is activated while the disc is playing by pressing a button on your TV's remote.
""Subtitling"" is activated by pressing a button on your DVD player's remote.
""Closed-Captioning"" is obsolete, but it's better than nothing.

Unfortunately closed captioning will not work if your DVD player is connected to the TV using the preferred modern method of HDMI cable.
You have to use the three-cable (red-white-yellow) method to connect your player to the TV.
[a lot of the less expensive DVD players do not even give you the option of a three-cable output - one tip: DVD/VCR combo players always include a three-cable output.]
(old-fashioned coaxial cable also will work with closed captioning)

The remastering on these DVDs is pretty old, but looks gorgeous.
I think they would look even better on blu-ray, with everything in 16:9 widescreen.
Whenever it is released on blu-ray, I hope we will have subtitles instead of closed captioning.

The A&E version is also available in separate volumes for Seasons 1 and 2, but that is really expensive.

P.S. An earlier ""Nero Wolfe"" series (14 episodes) aired on NBC in 1981 starring William Conrad  as Nero Wolfe.
It was preceded by a 1977 pilot starring Thayer David who passed away before filming on the series started.
Neither is commercially available at the present time,
nor are the two movies that Columbia Pictures made in the 1930s:
- ""Meet Nero Wolfe"" (1936) starring Edward Arnold
- ""The League of Frightened Men"" (1937) starring Walter Connolly

Excellent music.  Loved seeing the clothes styles and cars from the eras (1940's and 1950's and once - 1960's).

2471479,5,B000CRR3CE,"Nero Wolfe is ensconced in his New York brownstone which he very rarely ever leaves. Archie is his personal assistant, principal legman and the narrator that keeps the action moving. Archie ranges all over the city in his 1955 sharp suits, fedora and wingtips, in and out of close scrapes and the clutches of beautiful women. Wolfe has a rigid dining schedule, meals prepared by his Swiss chef fritz. He also can never be interrupted while tending his extensive orchid collection on the roof. Wolfe takes client audiences like King Solomon and treats most folks like the inferiors they usually are. He is arrogant, imperious, short tempered and....absolutely brilliant analyzing people, events and information He is the target of constant police harassment as they are usually upstaged by his theatrics solving complex murder cases. We have seen some of these on TV and a few more on DVD from our local library system. We were scheduled to winter for two months in a Florida condo with no direct knowledge of the TV or internet coverage so I purchased this series and the Lois and Clark when they were on sale from Amazon. The other tickler was the first ever stage production of a Nero Wolfe mystery in St. Paul at the Park Square Theater where we have season tickets. The play was a big success. Anyway, were are in our condo and enjoying one or two episodes occasionally and so far we are pleased. The production values are pretty good except for one curious and amusing element. It is like watching a repertory theater series because the stable of character actors remains basically the same with each taking different roles as the story demands. Of course Wolfe, Archie, Fritz, Wolfe's lawyer and ""muscle"" retain the same actors. I see the practicality but also envision the production company cranking out at least one episode every 10 days or so, possibly less.

2471535,5,B000CRR3CE,"Absolutely outstanding!

I just purchased the complete set (NOTE-the preview movie The Golden Spiders IS also in this very complete set) of season 1 and 2 from Amazon, and it is a region-free (or multi-region) DVD set that will play on any player (and was made in Australia, apparently). It was $77.69 with free shipping.  Amazon item #ASIN: B00DM8LFZ6.  8 disks, nearly 1,500 minutes.  It is superior! I had seen a few episodes back when they were broadcast, but I'd forgotten just how excellent the acting, production values, and costumes were.

And although I do own a region-free DVD player because of a collection I've put together of mostly UK TV shows, and I was prepared to play these on the player, I watched them all on my USA Region I Sony blu-ray player, so I know it will play on any player.  I had never heard of region free disks, but I'm surely glad to know they exist.

So, to be clear, do not hesitate to buy this set, whether you are in the USA or the UK. You will be able to view it.

Highly recommended. A&E really ought to show this treasure again, and Amazon or Netflix should make this available for streaming.",1404864000,110,1134,4.470873786407767
2471536,5,B000CRR3CE,I loved the series with william conrad. Too bad it was so short. This series brings the books to life. I am glad they made it a period pliece.

2471549,1,B000CRR3CE,"I give it one star for the beautiful cars, nice shots of brownstones, and little else.

Timothy Hutton is completely miscast as Archie. On top of it, he yells his way through the role. That passes for acting these days, I guess.

Chaykin is not fat enough and not believable at all. The real Wolfe could not even take the stairs and used an elevator to navigate all floors yet in the first episode he has made it down to the basement with no trouble.

In the books, the greenhouse is so crowded with flowers that one can hardly walk among the rows and Wolfe does not sit there wearing a suit. It looks like a fashion designer's living room in this series.

The plots are so confusing that even those of us who are fans of the books cannot follow and figure out what's happening. At the most, Stout had one femme fatale per story, not a different one in every scene.

It's as if the writers never took time to read even one Nero Wolfe book.

Very disappointing. I would give this no stars if it were possible.",1401667200,2,1008,4.278947368421052

2471560,4,B000CRR3CE,"I got this at the local library so price was not a consideration.

This is not a perfect show - I would have preferred different actors in the smaller roles for each episode for example - but overall this is a pretty faithful rendering. Timothy Hutton is almost perfect as Archie and Maury Chaykin is not bad as Wolfe.

Bill Smitrovich is good as Cramer but the rest of the cast is only ok.

The early stories are very close to the books especially considering the time constraints a TV program has. They started to fiddle with the stories more later in the series (as they did with Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett) but they are still pretty good. There was a little too much yelling but my wife and I still liked all the shows. Some of the shows are very, very good but all are above average. We were sorry to see this show end.

I would rate this a very good 8.75 to 9.25 stars out of 10, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1389571200,,912,4.254335260115607

2471563,3,B000CRR3CE,"It's a decent detective series following Nero Wolfe and his footman, Archie.  The secondary cast remains the same over the course of the series, with actors resurfacing in different roles; this was the part I didn't like about the series.  The production quality seemed to suffer towards the end of the series, which was another star lost.  Nonetheless, the show is an enjoyable series, and the time period is fascinating to watch.  I'd recommend this series to someone who really likes mystery stories, the books, and has run out of detective shows to watch.

I'd also recommend: the Mentalist, Monk, Psyche, Elementary, and Colombo.  The first centers on a ex-con artist and psychic who helps the police department solve cases with his ability to cold read and occasionally hypnotize people.  The second follows an eccentric, obsessive compulsive detective with a long list of phobias as he solve cases for the police.  Psyche follows two goof-offs, one who is hyper observant and the other who is a Pharmaceutical salesman as they bumble and solves cases while constantly breaking rules and police regulations.  Elementary follows a modern Sherlock Homes around in New York.  Colombo trails a self-effacing detective who uses flattery to trick suspects into a state of confidence to beguile information out of them or leave them off-guard and complacent as he investigates.",1387670400,,1376,5.157657657657658
2471564,5,B000CRR3CE,I enjoyed this series very much when it originally came out and I was very happy to find that it had been put on DVD.  Timothy Hutton is great in this series and the entire cast of changing characters is wonderful.  Very entertaining if you want something that isn't the usual violence that you get in the modern theater.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes the classic mystery.,1387238400,4,386,4.485714285714286
2471565,5,B000CRR3CE,"This is one of those rare shows. It has terrific writing, great direction, snappy music, amazing source material, and a stellar cast. Based on the Nero Wolfe mystery novels by Rex Stout, this A&E series makes the characters leap off of the page, and dazzle you on the screen.

Timothy Hutton has played many a great character, but for my money, Archie Goodwin is where he shines, bringing Stout's snappy dialogue to a new level of wit. When a raving man snaps at him, calling him a ""goon,"" Hutton's Goodwin doesn't miss a step replying, ""Actually, it's Goodwin. You forgot the D-W-I"" whist dragging him out of his employer's office, kicking and screaming. That scene alone is worth the price of admission.

The other lead is a presence unto himself. Maury Chaykin, a character actor you have most likely seen before, makes you instantly forget you're watching a television program. This character, for my money, was Chaykin's defining role. While a sleuth like Jessica Fletcher often comes under fire from the police, and sometimes even accused of murder, Chaykin's Wolfe would roar at the police during a party he was hosting, ""The police shall receive NO SANDWICHES!"" all because they were wasting their time, and thereby deemed a nuisance. I have yet to see another detective be as brash, as bold, or as much fun as the Nero Wolfe brought to life by the late Maury Chaykin.

I also feel the need to bring up the cast of this series. You're sure to see some familiar faces. That's because this show was almost like a theater troupe. The main people stayed the same, and every episode, the same actors would play new characters. I have yet to see another series do this.

So if any of the antics I've described have piqued your interest, I highly recommend checking out this series.",1386115200,7,1783,4.723472668810289

Archie's wit and style, Wolfe's brilliance and intolerance, Cramer's bad temper and begrudging respect for the detective's, Fritz's comedic timing and artistic temper, and the whole cast's charm and skill make this one of the greatest Novel adaptations I've ever known.

the acting is spectacular.  The writing stayed very close to the books.  I love the irreverent sense of humor.

One thing they did with this series is have a cast of actors where only a few main characters were played by the same actors throughout the series.  The other actors played different characters depending on which episode.  It could be confusing but I think it highlights the talent of the actors.

Timothy Hutton and company did a brilliant job recreating the great sophisticated mysteries about Nero Wolfe, Archie, Fritz and the rest of the gang.  How original to use an ensemble cast.  Kari Matchett  was so versatile in the series.  The music, graphics, and sets were all just perfect.  There was no disconnect between the sense of these characters as depicted in the books vs. the sense of them in the series.

2471615,5,B000CRR3CE,"Now my groaner of a pun is intentional because chic means style, class, panache and if this series possesses certain qualities those would most assuredly be on the list. It's not your average kind of ""who-dunnit"" by any means. I first saw it on A and E and really liked it. So when it became available on DVD I snatched it up right away.
  The plots, the characters and even the way things get wrapped up are far from the standard TV mystery fare. For one thing the cast is almost like a repertory company. One episode you might have X playing a particular character and the next episode he or she is someone else. I found that kind of refreshing. Of course the main players -- Wolfe, Archie, Fritz, etc. are recurring so it's not as if you don't have stability in the show. And as for Wolfe himself, he's well played as the recluse/genius with just enough goodness to make him admirable -- and formidable to those who would try and outwit him.  Then there's Archie Goodwin,  the guy who goes out and gets things done and a perfect compliment and welcome contrast to Wolfe's anti-social behavior. The stories are clever and the outcomes many times surprising -- at least they were for me.
  If you like mysteries that are stylish, period pieces (though I confess I think the time period is intentionally supposed to somewhat ambiguous, maybe 40's or early 50's?) and well-produced for TV then check this series out.
  And by the way, I think the characterizations are very close to the book, for those who are familiar with Rex Stout's popular sleuth. I read some of Stout's work and found this to be so.",1368057600,3,1604,4.525951557093426

When I discovered the DVD collection, I had to purchase it.  Now I can enjoy seeing the stories again and again.
The production was outstanding. The scenes, the clothing, cars, and language rang true to the books. Using Stout's words lent an authentic note. Stout wrote well so the scriptwriter had a perfect copy with which to begin.  I felt the actors portraying Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin were very well cast.

The style he brings is so ugly that you have to wonder about the rest of the characters devotion to him.

2471724,5,B000CRR3CE,"I can't praise this series highly enough.  The acting, writing, directing, production design, and especially the eye-popping period (1950s) costumes are of the highest quality.  The producers have, mercifully, been faithful to the Nero Wolfe stories, taking most of the dialogue and narration directly from Rex Stout's books (which can't be improved upon).  Timothy Hutton and Maury Chakin are perfection as Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe, respectively.  Archie is really the main character in Stout's books, and Hutton carries the part off with just the right amount of insouciance and style (helped by his killer wardrobe).  Maury Chaykin is wonderful, too, although I envisioned Wolfe as being a bit fatter.  But I think my favorite is Colin Fox's sly, elegant Fritz.  The repertory-style supporting cast, with the same actors appearing as different characters throughout the series, is top-notch; Kari Matchett is obviously a superb actress, because she manages to appear as the female lead in multiple episodes and never seems the same.

My one criticism is that A&E did not do another season of these.  I can't imagine that we will ever have another adaptation of the Nero Wolfe books as fine as this one, and I want MORE!  Bravi tutti.",1336521600,6,1241,5.129353233830845

2471729,1,B000CRR3CE,"I have to agree with the other one-star review for thi set. The the shouting grates on one's nerves. There is greater focus on the actors than on the story, with the result that one has the feeling of watching the same script over and over again because the story line gets lost again and again. The actors seem unable to stop barking, shouting or hurling insults at each other. If that is humor, then someone has lost his way.

Why did I watch the entire series if it is so dreadful? Well, I confess that having spent so much money on the set, I kept hoping that it would improve.

The producers of the DVD compilation seem to have been aware of the flaws because the final disc is acceptable (though nothing to rave about).

2471734,5,B000CRR3CE,"I started reading the Nero Wolfe mysteries in the '70s; they were favorites of my schoolteacher Aunt who lived in New York (and whose claim to fame was having met Rex Stout). I've always thought that these stories should be set to film but dreaded that notion since very few of my favorite writers have had their stories carried faithfully onto the screen. The Brits got it right with the Sherlock Holmes mysteries a couple of decades ago (with Jerermy Brett) but then, they know how to do it right.

So I purchased this series with some trepidation. It was entirely unfounded. These are wonderfully done and as authentic as can be. The sets, costuming, sound and music are rich and inviting. The acting is very good (as would be necessary with the character ensemble) and the dialogue is lifted from the original work, essentially word for word. This is one time when the production staff clearly wanted to be faithful to the original work and they succeeded. A rarity in this genre.

If you are a fan of the Rex Stout Nero Wolfe mysteries this set is a must. No one will ever make these into film better than what you see here. One of the best DVD purchases I've made in a very long time. Hats off to A&E for doing this much. Yes, more would be better; I have some favorites that didn't make it to film here. But we are talking about TV where quality clearly counts less than making money with inferior product.

Great performances all around and Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin are born to play respectively Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.  Only quibbles are that A&E did not make more of them and that they chose to pan and scan the episodes for the DVDs instead of leaving them in their originally shot widescreen aspect ratio.  Also skimpy on the extras.  But a good buy to have the complete episodes that were made for rewatchability.  Great scoring by Michael Small who has since passed.  Sadly Maury Chaykin has passed too.

Maury Chaykin is very good as Nero Wolfe (he just needs to be a little more embonpoint to be perfect).

Colin Fox is perfect as Fritz (oh, how I love his Fritz...to come to my house and cook for me).

Saul Rubinek is very funny as Lon Cohen...I wish we saw more of him.

Conrad Dunn is great as Saul Panzer...nifty with his gun.

The series was made with an ensemble cast with single episode roles rotating among the ensemble members. It almost feels like live theater.

There may be errors in car models parked on the streets, etc., but those are minor production issues which would only bother an extreme production purist. The acting leaves nothing more to be desired.

One week actress X was the damsel in distress, the next week, she was the murderer, another time the best friend or the vamp.  It gave the actors a chance to play a variety of parts which they seemed to enjoy!  The series, while dealing with an element of noir, still had humor. Archie, the narrator and Wolfe's ""secretary/investigator"", played by Timothy Hutton, was competent, cynical and irreverent towards his irascible boss.

It's also interesting to note that when you read the books that the TV programs were based on, the dialogue and plot are almost identical. You could practically read along with the program!

2471763,5,B000CRR3CE,"This is a very witty, well written and acted, weekly television series set in the 50s with all of the cars and fashions of that period. Timothy Hutton is excellent in his role of Archie Goodwin, the working layman detective, while Nero Wolfe, played by Maury Chaykin, is the obese mental giant who earns the huge fees while rarely venturing outdoors of his opulent, ornately furnished brownstone dwelling.

The rotating cast of many of the same actors, playing different roles, only make the series that much more intriguing. The main female actors rotate through various parts of heroine or villain and are just lovely and sexy while they do it.

Maury Chaykin is just about perfect as Nero Wolfe, going from thoughtful contemplation to manipulative cajoling, and then to perplexity to contempt for his adversaries' stupidity. This TV series is very well done and brings out of the complexities of the relationship between Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe as well as the written page did.

This set is one of the better quality sets that I have purchased from Amazon, as far as the quality of the picture and sound, and packaging of the discs are concerned, and in the more than two years that my wife and I have owned it, it has become one of her favorite shows to watch again and again.",1299196800,6,1286,4.706666666666667

I can't remember a series that got me so roped into watching it with such joy and entertainment. The characters are smart and witty, the writing quick and intelligent, something uncommon for TV, and the stage settings are colorful, complex and historically correct taking place from the mid 1930's to the 1960's. And if you are an old car buff you will be dazzled by all of the cars from the past in cherry condition. You will love the interaction between Nero Wolfe and his legman Archie Goodwin, and Fritz the cook has got to be the best in a pinch and in the kitchen.

I fell in love with Archie Goodwin.
I admit that I watched the first episode with a little trepidation, but this series has been adapted with care and love. Any changes made that are not verbatim to the stories/books maintain the spirit and intent of Rex Stout. They have also avoided turning them into overmannered period pieces.
Love the ensemble cast, and it is no mean feat for Maury Chaykin to portray Nero Wolfe as a human being rather than a charactature. He presents him as believably articulate and literate,intelligent(as one would expect for a genius!.),petulant and childish. His relationship with food is presented in all it's pretentious over the top glory. And yes, Rex Stout's presentation of this part of Wolfe's character was pretentious.
The humour is wonderful. I was always fascinated by Wolfe and Archie's codependant relationship, and this series handles it with affection and humour.
There is no such thing as perfection, particularly with books that are loved as much as these are, but the team that created this series has done a great job.

Now I have a lot of them on Kindle, but I'm still keeping my paper books. Am I addicted to Wolfe and Archie and Fritz and Saul? You bet I am. That's why I bought the DVDs.

I watched the original series on A&E, although I don't think I got to see all of the episodes. There was something about this series that irritated me and when I played the DVD's, I remembered instantly what it was. It was the way Timothy Hutton played Archie as a street-wise New Yorker. Archie was smoother, more sophisticated in the books and definitely a better dancer.

Even with that, the series is classy, the repertory players delightful, and Maury Chaykin is superb as Nero Wolfe. I admit I never realized how childish and petulant Wolfe was until I watched these DVDs. I'll be reading the books with a new eye.

Of course, there are many good things to say about it: the scenes, the excellent music, the costuming, the period authenticity.  But the acting, for me, leaves much to be desired.  The two principals, particularly Mr Hutton, are way over the top in their presentations.  Mr Hutton is a talented actor; however, this observer notices that in many of his scenes, he resorts to flamboyant gestures, self-satisfied and triumphant gazes shared with the audience.  So much for Archie.  As for Mr Chaykin's performance, I found more to distance myself emotionally.  True, an aging fat man is not everyone's idea of a sympathetic character, but his persona is not what I would look for.  I haven't read the original Nero Wolfe. Yet there are so many others whom I have found a personal kinship with.  Not necessarily Peter Falk's Columbo, et al., but these two alienate in the extreme.  Too much shouting by the principals, and, of course other players as well, particularly the bald-headed FBI chief in the first episode.

The quick cutting -- far too quick -- made this viewer extremely uncomfortable.

These and the femmes fatales.  These too, are chilling, repugnant performances I found anything but enjoyable to watch.

In short, I cannot understand why the director would call for such overacting as
these players resort to.  I'm sure there are other viewers who'll disagree.  But I speak from experience, having done sone acting myself. So be it.",1274313600,7,1527,4.956692913385827
2471786,5,B000CRR3CE,"Rex Stout died in 1975, 25 years before the pilot episode ""The Golden Spiders"" aired for A&E Network's incarnation of his larger-than-life creation. Had he lived to see it, it is easy to imagine that he would have been delighted with ""Nero Wolfe"".
  Stout's whodunits sailed under stiff comic breezes, freighted with corpses but sparing of grisly details. His sleuth is a ratiocinating detective in the manner of Sherlock Holmes who never leaves his home on business, never discusses his cases at meals, dresses fastidiously, and adheres to a strict daily routine he is loath to interrupt regardless what is at issue, money or murder. He is a 280-pound gourmand with a passion for orchids, beer, books, and leisure. His vocabulary is vast and he employs it as detectives of the hard-boiled variety use their fists. He solves all of his cases by confronting suspects conveniently congregated for the denouement. He is arrogant, irascible, petulant, bombastic, and indifferent to the charms of the fairer sex. He is a genius. He is Nero Wolfe.
  Our narrator is Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's live-in legman, detective, secretary, bookkeeper, consultant, and scourge. Fearless, impudent and jaunty, Archie is an even better dresser than Wolfe, possesses a steel trap memory, loves poker, corned beef sandwiches and milk, dances gracefully and has an eye for the ladies although he keeps his hands to himself. Wolfe hates to work and it is Archie's job to prod him into accepting the cases that finance their lives, the four-story brownstone on Manhattan's West 35th Street, Wolfe's resident chef and housekeeper Fritz, and the 10,000 orchids on the top floor.
  Wolfe's antagonist, though never his adversary, is perpetually apoplectic Inspector Cramer of Homicide, who resents Wolfe's civilian intrusion into police business, his high-handed tactics, and his unimpeachable success rate.
  Rex Stout wrote 73 Nero Wolfe stories from 1934 to 1975, a span of American history that began during Franklin Roosevelt's Fireside Chats and extended through Richard Nixon's Watergate denials, a compass that embraced the Great Depression, swing music, World War II, bebop, the atomic bomb, Korea, McCarthyism, rock 'n roll, civil rights, the Space Age, Viet Nam, and feminism to name but a few of its salient influences. Nevertheless, from beginning to end, the characters of Wolfe, Archie, Fritz, and Cramer are as ageless and impervious to social weathering as the figures on Mount Rushmore.
  The A&E Network aired 20 episodes of ""Nero Wolfe"" in 2001 and 2002. The series producers made two significant artistic decisions. First, they elected to retain a reverential regard for Rex Stout's text, incorporating narrative and dialog lifted directly from the author's pages. The interior of the brownstone, described in explicit detail in the original stories, is observed as exactly as an architect's elevations, including the colors of the chairs in Wolfe's office and the waterfall wall art that masks the peep hole in the adjoining front room. Second, they crystallized the series into one representative time period, circa 1953, a post-war moment epitomized by a certain exuberance in fashion and automobile design that informs both the smart look of the series and Archie's attitude and attire.
  Timothy Hutton plays Archie Goodwin with superior panache. As an executive producer and the director of four of the episodes, Hutton had a strong hand in establishing the atmosphere and tone of the series.
  Maury Chaykin is Nero Wolfe. Though he does not possess the ""seventh of a ton"" physique of the character, he more than carries his weight in the role. He growls, roars, huffs, snaps, states assuredly and remonstrates implacably. His voice modulates from unction to umbrage with forceful inflection and flawless pronunciation.
  All the regulars from the novels and short stories are on hand. Colin Fox is dapper and correct as Fritz; Bill Smitrovich is a nest of angry hornets as Cramer; R.D. Reid is Cramer's phlegmatic assistant Sergeant Purley Stebbins. The A-Team detectives Saul Panzer (Conrad Dunn), Fred Durkin (Fulvio Cecere) and Orrie Cather (Trent McMullen) are on call for backup and omniscient newsman Lon Cohen (Saul Rubinek) of the ""Gazette"" is ever ready to trade insider gossip for scoops. Handy Doctor Vollmer, useful attorney Nathaniel Parker, and full-time orchid expert Theodore Horstmann make their appearances.
  A versatile repertory cast handles the various clients, suspects and supporting characters. Kari Matchett, Boyd Banks, James Tolkan, Debra Monk, Mimi Kuzyk, Gary Reineke, Beau Starr, Robert Bockstael, Nicky Guadagni, Francie Swift, David Schurmann, Richard Waugh, Marian Seldes, Kathryn Zenna, Christine Brubaker and M.J. Kang deliver considerable vim and solid thespian chops.
  Michael Small provides the swinging ""Nero Wolfe"" theme and incidental music.
  Rex Stout wrote most of his Nero Wolfe whodunits for pulp magazines. When he began, he was a contemporary of luminous mystery writers Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. The stories of all three were designed to be diversions, literary transports for an audience accustomed to reading as a primary form of entertainment. In their construction, subject matter, and import the work of these writers could scarcely be more different. What they shared was an exalted joy in the use of language. Hammett was relentlessly original. Chandler had a muscular gift for description and characterization. Rex Stout specialized in wordplay. His setting and characters were necessarily formulaic and his plots just clever enough to keep the pages turning. It is Stout's infusion of humor into Wolfe's sonorous prosody and Archie's sarcastic asides that endear the characters to us and rightfully canonize Nero Wolfe among detectives that dominate the fictional landscape. The A&E series does Wolfe justice and invigorates the monument.",1273017600,11,5911,5.38136511375948

2471790,3,B000CRR3CE,"I grew up watching the 1980s ""Nero Wolfe"" series staring William Conrad, which I fondly remembered.  When I first heard about a new series produced by the A & E Network, I was really looking forward to it.

Originally broadcast as ""A Nero Wolfe Mystery,"" this series ran for two seasons from 2001-2002, and is simply a work of brilliance.  Much like Jeremy Brett did in the 1984-1994 Granada Television&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B000RPCJB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes</a>&nbsp;series, Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin have perfectly captured the characters of Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe. (Although Chaykin needs to be fattened up a bit to be spot-on)  It would be difficult to see other actors take on the role now.

Another part of the fun of this Nero Wolf series is the use of reparatory actors, meaning an ensemble cast that will take on different roles for each episode in the same way they might for a theater.  This threw me for a loop at first, as I thought maybe some of the characters were in disguise, but once I figured it out it was fun to spot the re-appearing actors.

This boxset has the entire American relase series of ""A Nero Wolfe Mystery,"" including the pilot film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Spiders/dp/0553385674/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Spiders</a>&nbsp;which happens to be the first Rex Stout Nero Wolf novel I had ever read.  There are twenty episodes overall, and it is a shame that this series was cut so short.  Rex Stout left a lot of great material to be mined, and Chaykin and Hutton deserved the chance to impress us with some more of it.

The huge disappointment with this boxset set is that more of the series does exist, but it isn't presented here.  The International and European releases of ""A Nero Wolf Mystery"" were considerably longer, in some cases twice as long, and all episodes were filmed in a widescreen presentation.  What is offered in this boxset is the same thing broadcast on American TV, meaning the series has been cropped for pan-and-scan and edited down to make shorter episodes.

In total there is more than 3.5 hours of ""A Nero Wolfe Mystery"" that exists but for whatever bizarre reason has not been shown to American audiences. The edited versions available on this boxset are still fantastic, but I wish they would release all of the available material.",1268956800,69,2471,5.305128205128205

Anyone who has read the Rex Stout books will enjoy this collection.  Timothy Hutton plays a great Archie Goodwin.  He has the tough guy angle down great and the way he responds to Nero Wolfe is, I feel what Rex Stout was looking for when he made the character.  Maury Chaykin portrays Wolfe's arrogance perfectly and the relationship between he and Archie really is right out of the books.

2471798,5,B000CRR3CE,"Rex Stout's detective stories are among the very best of the genre.  They are pure detective stories, not ""action"" stories or ""crime fiction.""  Stout invented a completely different sleuth; Nero Wolfe is a corpulent orchid fancier who seldom leaves his Manhattan brownstone but has his junior partner, Archie, do the leg work.  The writing was literate, the plots cerebral.

These TV depictions of the Rex Stout tales capture everything perfectly.  Maury Chaykin is marvelous as Nero Wolfe, and Timothy Hutton is at least adequate as Archie.  Before watching these I wasn't sure Hutton was up to playing the sometimes strongarm sidekick, but he does it fine.

Rather that try to bring the stories up-to-date, the producers wisely retained the 1950's atmosphere, clothes, prices, cars, etc.  Thus, the series transports the viewer back to that era.

Anyone who enjoyed the Rex Stout writings will surely enjoy these DVDs again and again.  To those who don't enjoy these--""Pfuii,"" as Wolfe would say.",1266710400,5,998,5.18125

2471802,4,B000CRR3CE,"In some respects, the TV series does not match up to my hopes for the series.  Timothy Hutton is not quite up to par as Archie Goodwin - at least the Archie Goodwin I had pictured in my mind.  Sometimes I feel like he is over the top and even downright goofy.  However, after watching the various episodes several times, I have become accustomed to his portrayal of the character.

Maury Chaykin would be a marvelous Wolfe if he were only fatter.  However, his diction and his ability to bellow are up to the task and once his physique is overlooked, he does an outstanding job.

I have re-read the books upon which some of the individual TV stories are based and it is a tribute to Rex Stout that much of the dialogue is reproduced exactly as Stout wrote it.  In addition to being a tribute to Stout it is also a tribute to whoever was responsible for creating and/or approving the TV scripts.

Some episodes do a bit of omission with individual stories but it seems obvious that this is necessary to fit within the time restraints of a TV show.  I do not feel these omissions seriously jeopardize the integrity of the written story.

With the use of an ensemble cast that portrays different parts with each episode, I found it a bit disturbing when primary characters in the series are played by different actors.

I can understand why some would find the musical score distracting.  But, I found it refreshing and I did not find it to be distracting.  I also enjoyed the originality of the opening credits.  It was obvious that someone put a lot of time and thought into them - more so than in most TV series.

In the episode, ""Prisoner's Base"", the Nero Wolfe character uses the word ""contact"" as a verb.  While this seems like a quibble, I doubt that Rex Stout or Nero Wolfe would find it a quibble.  When I first heard it, I re-played it to make sure I had heard it correctly.  I did hear it correctly and to any Wolfe reader, it is blasphemy.

Also, in several episodes, a great deal of choreography went into dance sequences.  This is a tribute to Archie's mention of dancing ability in many stories.

Having listed a few complaints, I have to say that, overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the TV series and it was far better than most of what is offered on TV.

I recommend it to any who is a Nero Wolfe fan with the realization that some will find my recommendation offensive.",1265760000,3,2380,4.422988505747126
2471803,5,B000CRR3CE,"Since I have read nearly all Stout's classic books many times, I was initially nervous about the TV series: would they get it right, or would they change the stories too much?  They GOT IT RIGHT, keeping most of the dialogue and making excellent choices for the cast.  The clothing and sets have just the right mid-20th-century period feel.  And above all it's a joy watching the personal chemistry between Archie (hardboiled Man of Action with a well-hidden sentimental side) and Wolfe (who epitomizes the curmudgeonly armchair detective).",1263772800,2,540,5.113636363636363

One difference between these guys and other detectives is the elegance that Nero Wolfe (Maury Chaykin) exudes.  Whether it's the leather upholstered furniture in the Study/Office, the sumptuious meals in the formal dining room or the fabulous Orchid Collection in the penthouse, the settings are lush, plush and ohhhhhhhh, so stylish.

The entire production is a tribute to first rate, upper crust, obviously expensive sets, wardrobe and incidental props and ""extras"" (additional cast).  The expense of making the series was one reason A&E cancelled the series (how short-sighted).  Only 20 episodes, plus the Pilot were made.

2471808,5,B000CRR3CE,"I just fell in love with this show when it first aired on A&E around 2000.  Though it was only on for two seasons, it is probably one of my favorites.  ""Nero Wolfe""  is dramatic at times, but has a lot of comedic aspects, too.  It actually started out as a single movie, rather than a formal Pilot episode.  A&E got such a good response from it that they ordered about 12 more episodes.  This then turned into a second season.  The dialogue is excellent, and fast-paced.  One doesn't necessarily need an English degree to keep up with this show, but it helps!  I don't have one, yet was able to keep up!  The story lines are edgy, taking place in the 1940s.  What's unique is the fact that a lot of the same actors are featured throughout the show, though they play different characters in each episode.  The exception is the main actors, who always play the same respective roles.  This set is well-produced; great sound and video quality.  Packaging is excellent, where each disc has its own case.  Amazon.com does a great job with shipping.  The only regret I have about the show is that more seasons weren't produced!",1253923200,3,1121,4.502487562189055

2471811,5,B000CRR3CE,"Without a doubt this is one of the best mystery series ever. In a day in which crime drama is full of DNA, crime labs, blood, violence, gunfights and more, this series is just plain fantastic. The casting is perfect. Timothy Hutton as the wisecracking, steet smart, lovable Archie Goodwin is Archie. Maury Chaykin captures the master detective who is afraid of fresh air and his love for food is equaled for his love or orchids. Colin Fox is the loyal friend to Archie and the chef who always seems to challenge Nero's desire for perfect food. Bill Smitrovich as Inspector Cramer is always chomping on a cigar as he boils over at Nero solving a crime. Conrad Dunn as Saul Panzer is tough, straight foward and always there when needed.
R.D. Reid as Sergeant Purley Stebbins, Saul Rubinek as Lon Cohen, Fulvio Cecere as Fred Durkin and Trent McMullen as Orrie Cather round out perfect casting of regular characters.
  Another great factor of the show is the core cast of actors and actresses who play different characters in different episodes. If is fun to watch and see the different players and they become a different person from adventure to adventure. They include the lovely Kari Matchett, James Tolkan, Boyd Banks, Christine Brubaker, George Plimpton, Debra Monk, Bill MacDonald, Francie Swift, Beau Starr and many others.
  Keeping the show in the time period of the 40's and 50's is true to the stories. The set, the costumes, the cars and other factors capture the period and style of the stories.
  So if you want to think, if you want to laugh, if you want to enjoy, if you want to escape for a period from the world, watch Nero Wolfe.",1243555200,10,1646,4.658620689655172

For one who lived his teen years with Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin in paperbacks that were read by most of the family many times until the binding was broken, the yellowing pages falling out, it was a welcome addition to my library to have this series. Whilst I was a wee bit disappointed with the eighth disc, I had to realize the parameters that faced an A&E production. What was produced was the best of a classic period and I finally had to admit that the eighth and final disc was in the words of Nero Wolfe, ""Satisfactory.""

To watch an episode in which vintage cars appeared here and there, a Rolls Royce might be nice but to see a Classic Studebaker appear was for ever a memory.

The episode of Inspector Cramer writing a cheque for his wife only to be interupted by Archie wanting the Inspector's signature was first class humor. Mrs. Cramer pointing out to Archie that Fergus (the Inspector) referrred to him as a rogue as she smiled at the one she referred to as a ""nice young man.""

All the girls and guys too loved Archie Goodwin. Wolfe considered him as capable of getting a woman to do anything he wanted. And, whatever that was, Wolfe would consider it as ""Satisfactory."" Archie was a man's man and a woman's man as well. Regardless of a woman's attributes, Archie could always watch her eyes.

But, to know Archie, you have to know ""The Swagger."" Archie could leave The Brownstone that was office, home, atrium and fortress, and take up his walk with ""The Swagger."" If you're a guy, you have to get the right position of your hands and the swing of your arms, the straight-ahead look as though you own the street, and the whole body will then move in ""The Swagger."" You will know that the adventure of the moment has begun.

Now I'm not a genius but Nero Wolfe is and living with a genius is what you will see through Archie's eyes. Both men know what comes with a remarkable woman.",1242604800,7,2126,4.84573002754821

If you are a fan of the Rex Stout books, you're sure to LOVE the (too short) seried from A&E. The episodes are a very faithful adaptation of the books and, in fact, have actually enhanced our enjoyment of the books.

Part of what makes the series even more entertaining is the repitoire players who get to be a different character with each episode.

2471831,5,B000CRR3CE,"New fans of Nero Wolfe and the long time hardcore set who have read the books and listened to the radio show alike will love this series.  Timothy Hutton nails Archie Goodwin, using the swift cadence and ironically amused tone that is 100% Archie.  He uses Rex Stout's words and finds the character within their rhythm.

Chaykin nails Nero Wolfe as well -- you'd hardly know you weren't watching Sydney Greenstreet, except for the fact that Chaykin is better, pulling off Wolfe's irritability without that underscoring sense of squicky (yes, a technical term) that Greenstreet exuded.

The interactions between Archie, Wolfe, and Fritz (also nailed the character, by the way) are perfect.  The comic timing couldn't be better.  Again, the actors use the rhythm and cadence in the words that Rex Stout chose for their characters as a guide, and that helps them be more believable.

In general, all of the regulars couldn't have been played better or cast more perfectly.

The fact that the show is a troupe style thing, with the same actors coming in with different roles is, to me, a bonus.  It hearkens back to the roots of Nero Wolfe, in radio.  During that time, there were a set cast of radio actors who got regular work, and many of these would come back to the same show again and again playing different parts.  Plus, Daddy Warbucks from Annie is in it, and you really can't object to that.

This is a classy, sassy piece of television entertainment. The roles of Wolfe and Goodwin were made for Chaykin and Hutton (who I seriously under-estimated as an actor before this role). This is period murder mystery par excellence and it deserved a much longer tenure, but sometimes not allowing a series to develop too long and degenerate is a good thing.

This series is an indulgence that demands multiple repeat viewings. The reason is firstly excellent story lines. But more importantly, and amazingly thrusting the plot into second place, is the clever and witty script and the brilliant repartee between the characters. You'll want to watch it over and over just to enjoy the subtle elements. The sets give an exquisite feel that reminds me of the beginning of Bogard's The Big Sleep. The rotation of the guest roles amongst a small stable of excellent actors adds to the opulence. And the side show with the ever suffering cook, Fritz, is an ongoing delight.

This is the sort of series to be enjoyed on a lazy Sunday afternoon, cold and wet, you ensconsed in reclining armchair, fleecy robe and slippers, hot chocolate at hand with a rich licquer at the ready. This is not for you rev heads looking for the fast track Ferrari experience. This is an indulgent country drive in a Daimler or Jaguar meant to be savoured like a five course meal rather than a fast food experience.

If you've ever enjoyed attending a successful stage production, if you've ever enjoyed reading a well written book, this is television's equivalent. This is intelligent television and easily a five star viewing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nero-Wolfe-The-Complete-Classic-Whodunit-Series/dp/B000CRR3CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nero Wolfe - The Complete Classic Whodunit Series</a>",1215216000,10,1983,5.407766990291262

The fabulous cast play the characters as if they were BORN TO THE ROLES!!
No expense was spared in creating the atmosphere of the time - Nero's home is exactly as I had pictured it - each room springs to life from the very pages of the books !!

2471851,5,B000CRR3CE,"If you've never read Rex Stout (and it's getting more and more difficult to do that) there's good news...you now don't have to.  If, like me, you're already a Nero Wolfe fan and have a nearly complete library of the novels, the time has come to take it to the next level.  In their interviews neither Timothy Hutton (Archie Goodwin) or Maury Chaykin (Wolfe) indicate any particular Stout fandom and yet the chemistry between them....and among the entire cast of repertory players for that matter...is so `spot on' you're likely to feel (as I do) that you are reading the originals.  Hutton masterfully captures the wise-cracking Goodwin, narrator of the novels and novellas, and Chaykin is Wolfe to a tee.  Colin Fox is a perfect Fritz and Bill Smitrovich does an excellent  Inspector Cramer.  Only these four stick to their assigned roles throughout the series and it can be just a little bit jarring to watch Kari Matchett go from Archie's sophisticated lady friend to a bee-bopping dancer (in one episode she plays two roles), or George Plimpton doing a sleazy broker one night and then playing the role of Wolfe's lawyer the next.  But that only adds to the fun, from my point of view, watching the players take on the roles--sometimes even jumping from actor to director and back.

To assist the players in answering these demands for adaptability are great sets and costumes, fudged a little from the originals.  Stout set his tales across the 30s, 40s, and 50s but the producers (Hutton included) elected to combine them all using 30s sets, 40s costumes, and 50s automobiles.  Still, the mix works...colorfully.  I dare you to try to wipe that silly grin off your face while watching.

BTW...I've noticed a few other reviewers griping about A&E canceling the series.  Are they kidding?  Who needs television when we can have these DVDs in our living room, to watch on our own schedule, without commercial interruption!",1203811200,6,1925,4.865030674846626

What I want to review is the video or image quality and, in short, it SIMPLY STUNNING! I was more than pleasantly surprised when I played the first disk.

My DVD player is a Toshiba HD DVD A20, IMO one of the best up-converting players on the market.

On this setup the Nero Wolfe disks are fantastic, not HD but close enough. Image quality is clear and crisp with the great textures of fabric and skin that we now associate with hd dvds. Color are bright and accurate with absolutely no bleeding. Most of all, I've noticed no indication of excessive compression such as halos around edges.

There! It had to be covered. In short, I'm ecstatic over these disks and, as far as I'm concerned, there's no reason to release them in HD.

2471857,5,B000CRR3CE,"I do love almost everything about the video series, which is also to say that I like Stout's ideas and narrative.  The characters, major and minor, are great, as is the byplay between them.  One opinion and question, however.  I'm personally not real happy with either the victim(s) and/or the culprit, with one or two exceptions, almost always being women.  (Sorry to spoil things for some would-be buyers.)  Stout, who I'm guessing is now deceased, wrote in an era when domestic abuse and crime was still in the closet, and it may not have been very interesting fiction for a character-based detective series anyway.  And except for domestic murder, then and now, I'm further guessing that 9 of 10 murder victims and culprits are men.  Now, fiction does have to conform to reality, and can be better when it does not.  However, in this case I, for one, am not happy with Stout's choices.  And this further leads me to wonder if Stout (and many of his presumed male readers) had some women 'issues'.  A previous reviewer (Simonds, 9/16/'07) sees Stout's women as 'hysterical, child-like, and losing their veneer of adult maturity under stress'.  I don't completely agree here, but not totally disagreeing, it does add fuel to the fire.",1198022400,,1236,4.838095238095238

2471861,4,B000CRR3CE,"It's not quite Stout, but it's great TV.  Some pros:

* Outstanding recreation of the brownstone and everything in it.  This includes tiny details like Wolfe's black silk coverlet, the fact that he wears yellow shirts (an improvement over the pilot movie), most aspects of the office (except for the blue walls and the globe, which isn't modern like the one in the books, though it is suitably huge).

* Chaykin becomes a superb Wolfe over the course of the series.  He's too smug and calm in the pilot movie, too loud and obnoxious in early season one, but by season two he has settled in and gotten it on the nose, shifting through Wolfe's various stylistic gears accurately.  ""The Silent Speaker"" in particular is really good -- the best of all the stories, I think.

* Even though he was a good bit older than Archie at the time, Hutton appears a bit boyish for the role, but he captures Archie's spirit and basic charm well, and I like the interaction with Chakin -- not an easy thing to recreate from the books at all.  The heart of these books is Archie's narrative appeal, and there isn't enough of that, but they only had eighty minutes to tell an entire novel, after all.

* Kari Matchett is quite good in many different female roles, particularly as Archie's girlfriend Lily Rowan and the nightclub singer Julie Jaquette.  She actually plays both of these very different roles in the same episode (""Death of a Doxy""), showcasing her versatility.

Some cons:

* Stagey, overdramatic acting by some of the supporting cast give certain episodes a campy quality which Stout didn't intend.

* Campiness is also apparent in the sets at client businesses, which have a simplistic, fake quality in several cases.  This has a jarring effect next to the extreme realism of the brownstone, and I can only guess limited budgets are the root cause.

* Women are frequently portrayed as hysterical, childlike creatures with only a thin veneer of adult maturity which will evaporate under moderate stress.  Granted, Stout often portrayed them in this way also, but it seems exaggerated.

Still, they did a nice job all in all.  I regret the Zeck stories weren't covered, since they would have been particularly good.",1189900800,6,2212,4.7460732984293195

The score is atrocious, distracting, and almost always inappropriate.  The casting is ludicrous to anyone who has read the Nero Wolfe books.  The direction is often distracting and self-indulgent.  And Timothy Hutton's ""Archie"" is just 'way over the top.  The ""ensemble casting"" for the series, where the same actors play different parts in different episodes is not, in itself, wholly objectionable, except when it is one of Stout's primary characters, and/or it is woefully miscast.

What saving grace there is is provided by (1) the excellent Wolfe--Maury Chaykin does a very credible and entertaining job, although somewhat less physically imposing (I had always imagined someone the size and demeanour of Orson Welles or Sidney Greenstreet) and more physically active than the Wolfe in the novels, and (2) the Rex Stout stories and dialogue.

Then, to add insult to injury, after suffering through two season's worth of episodes, one discovers on the last disc, ""The Golden Spiders"", the original TV-movie upon which the series was premised.  That original production was everything the series was not.  Excellent score.  Perfect casting.  And an unexaggerated ""Archie"" who does not perform as if in a Broadway farce.

While this series might be entertaining to young teenagers who have never read any of Rex Stout's works, I certainly cannot recommend it to anyone who appreciates the art that prompted Marlene Dietrich to write to Rex Stout, suggesting that if she were young and a man, she could ""play Archie better than anyone"".",1166832000,16,1667,5.088235294117647
2471876,5,B000CRR3CE,"Just what we need ... another rave review for A&E's ""Nero Wolfe"".  Well, perhaps we will find a few things to say that haven't been said before.

Alas, this fine series lasted only 2 seasons - actually, 1 more than I expected after I saw it.  Not for the reason that it's too high-end for the channel.  We might do well to recall that at the time A&E was doing other high-quality (read: British) mysteries.  The actual reason is much more organic.  In the main Nero Wolfe is an extremely unattractive character.  And Maury Chaykin is such a fine actor that he can't help but bring this quality out and right in the viewer's face.

Timothy Hutton, who played Archie Goodwin, also directed and co-produced the series.  Brilliantly, by the way.  One of his best touches was to downplay Wolfe (to the extent that this was possible) and up-play Archie.  I believe we heard rumblings of ""ego"" at the time, but not so.  Archie is a much, much more likeable character, especially when represented by Hutton's puckish face.  By giving more prominence to Archie Goodwin, Hutton gives the show a friendlier face and Wolfe becomes a foil for Archie instead of a less-pleasant center of attention.  Still, Chaykin is so good - and in a rle he was born to play -- that he tends to dominate any scene he's in, but at least it's not so much.

There also the question of the setting.  Blurbs on this series indicate the setting is the 1950s.  Now, while it is true that Stout was still writing Wolfe stories in that decade (they ranged from 1934 to 1985), there are problems.  Chaykin turned 52 in 2001, the first year of the series.  Wolfe would have been 52 in 1944, having been born in 1892, the son of Sherlock Holmes and ""the woman"", Irene Adler.  In the 1950s, Wolfe would have been in his 60s, rather than his 50s.  Furthermore, the ambiance of the episodes seems ambivalent as to timing - as we might expect from a set of stories covering about 3 decades.  The Depression, World War II, and the Korean War are not in evidence.  Most of the episodes are not dateable, save to assume the date the story was published.

One episode, however, is absolutely dateable in the sense that it cannot be later than 1939/40.  That is ""Over My Dead Body"", in which a member of the Serb nobility is angling to sell logging concession in Bosnian forests to a U.S. company.  This would have been absolutely possible during 1939/40-1945 because Europe was at war.  It would have been even more impossible after 1945 because Yugoslavia was under the control of Tito and the Communist party.  The original story was published in 1940 and presumably written earlier when Serb toffs might still be able to manipulate their nation's resources for their own advantage.

As for the rest of the ambiance of the series, there are gadgets that appear more modern than the 1930s, but the Big Band era is still in full swing when pop music was already moving away from that and Frank Sinatra had already coined (or at least first used in a song) the ominous phrase ""rock and roll"".  On the whole, however, the whole effect is charming and effective, letting Wolfe's world float in a Neverland of a generalized American past.  Many of the colorful costumes and outfits lend credibly to this impression.

The various episodes move along crisply, with excellent and literate scripts.  That's another reason the program vanished so quickly:  clever use of good vocabularies is of course a turn-off for most couch potatoes.  One wonders how West Wing made it past its 1st season.

""Nero Wolfe"" is in the best sense of the term presented by an ensemble cast.  The main characters work well together, of course.  But beyond this, a larger crew of actors appears again and again, playing different roles.  This is far less disconcerting than we might imagine, owing to the talents of the actors and of the make-up/costuming people.  It's more disconcerting while watching the episodes seriatim rather than once a week.

It's impossible to recommend this fine series too strongly.  It's one of the very few top-notch mystery programs not produced in Britain.  Buy it or at least rent it and watch it all the way through.  I'd give it 7 or 8 stars if I could.",1163548800,29,4211,4.632432432432433
2471877,5,B000CRR3CE,"I've read and re-read Rex Stout's books for over 20 years.  I think I've read all of the Nero Wolfe books, and own forty of them (some are quite difficult to find).  I remember the 1970's or 80's series that was, well, bad, and wasn't expecting much from this.

Timothy Hutton IS Archie Goodwin.  A few of Hutton's mannerisms irritate, but that was part of Goodwin's job for Wolfe.  Chaykin is brilliant as Wolfe, and the ensemble cast does a wonderful job.  Kari Matchett is superb in several of her roles.  The actors who played Stebbins and Cramer didn't meet with my expectations, but that's just a personal thing - they did a fine job with the roles.  At first I didn't like the choices for Fred and Orrie, but they grew on me.  Colin Fox is almost perfect as Fritz.

2471878,5,B000CRR3CE,"I have been a fan of Rex Stout for a long, long time. One reason I often dislike seeing books made into movies, or at least feel the movie pales when compared to the books, because often people see things differently. So when a beloved set of characters such as Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin is brought to film, I automatically cringe, because I am rarely pleased with the results. They tried in the late 70's with Thayer David playing Wolfe and Tom Mason as Archie. Excellent casting, but was a little late. Thayer David, a Sydney Greenstreet type actor, was perfect casting for Wolfe - the 1/7 of a ton genius detective that detects while never leaving him home. Only David was already ill, dying of cancer, so the weight loss and lacking of strength sadly hurt his performance. Later it was redone with William Conrad as Wolfe and too sexy Lee Horsely as Archie. Sorry, the series had Wolfe pacing when expounding to suspects and sitting on the corner of his desk. It made you wonder if the writers ever read Stout's books. So, when

Timothy Hutton stepped into Archie's shoes I had mixed reservations. I love Hutton, son of the brilliant Jim Hutton. While you see a lot of his daddy in him, he is definitely his own man, and cuts a smart style when fleshing out his roles.

So I thought, okay, he would make a good Archie. Then I wondered what about Wolfe? They cast Maury Chaykin. Brilliant! Wow, someone actually loved the books enough to follow them.

A&E is to be commended in letting Hutton run with the series for two seasons. They are to be CONDEMNED for canceling it because they deemed it too expensive to make. Shame on them! The series was a class act all the way. A delightful ensemble cast who changed roles episode to episode gave it a theatre feel.

The costuming is great, the acting divine and the stories - well, I actually KNEW what book they were based on! It was HEAVEN.

 utterly adored Jim Hutton in his Ellery Queen series, so when his equally talented son Tim announced he was doing Nero Wolfe I had mixed emotions. Tim is talented; his works speaks of the quality of his career. But so many times when a series of books such as Rex Stout's beloved 1/7 of a ton detective and his wisecracking assistant Archie are put on film, devoted fans of the books cringe at the efforts. It's rare that a series will live up to what you have created in your minds. Very often, they snatch the title, characters names and then they are off-and-running writing their own teleplays. This happened with the Lee Horsley-William Conrad effort back in the early 80s. Dreadful! It little bore a resembled to Stout's books. Conrad's Wolfe actually paced and sat on the edge of his desk - as all fans know Wolfe would NEVER do!!! Off the bat, the rich period detail of this television version done for A&E (the idiots that cancelled it!), is evocative of the same leisurely attention to quality and detail that was done on the elder Hutton's Ellery Queen.

The cast is perfect, the setting of Wolfe's brownstone pulled from my imagination. Even more so, I really recognize the faithful following of the plots of the books!

It's a quality production from start to finish and A&E should hang its head in SHAME for canceling this gem.

The second season set includes:

Disc 1

1) Death of a Doxy

2) The Next Witness

3) Die like a Dog

Disc 2

1) Murder is Corny

2) Motherhunt

3) Poison a la Carte

So A&E I thank you for putting out these wonderful episodes so we Archie Addicts can enjoy them again. And go take a flying leap for canceling what is nirvana in detective land. Let's hope A&E one day wakes up and put Tim and the crew back to work!",1158019200,151,3888,4.427566807313643

Dont't take my word look it up yourself, google it! As for the content, EXCELLENT, if you like dry, witty, or sarcastic humor, along with murder mysteries and the most appealing class of the early 1900's, this is definatly for you. each episode was WELL worth it.",1156809600,43,503,4.538461538461538

2471881,5,B000CRR3CE,"In print, Nero Wolfe is an acquired taste.  It takes the reader a couple of stories to get past Wolfe's arrogance, eccentricity, and general misanthropy and truly appreciate his intelligence, loyalty, and (slightly warped) sense of ethical obligation.  On the screen, as portrayed by Maury Chaykin, you immediately appreciate the brilliant behemoth.  The Archie Goodwin of the printed page is always engaging, and Timothy Hutton captures his charm perfectly.

The recurring characters of the repertory cast (Inspector Cramer, Perly Stebbins, Saul Panzer, Fred Durkin, Orrie Cather, Lon Cohen, and Fritz Brenner) are likewise portrayed with admirable faithfulness to the print characters.  The dialog is lifted almost word-for-word from the pen of Rex Stout, and the stories adhere faithfully to the plotlines of the novels and novellas from which they are adapted.

In short, A&E's ""Nero Wolfe"" is the best mystery series ever shown on TV.  Its cancellation was a travesty.",1156032000,38,973,5.446666666666666
2471882,5,B000CRR3CE,"Anyone who is a fan of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe series will be thrilled to buy the two seasons of A&E's television series. The casting couldn't be more perfect. Maury Chaykin has absolutely captured Nero Wolfe's mannerisms and idiosyncrasies. Timothy Hutton, who plays Archie Goodwin, has excellently portrayed Nero Wolfe's fast talking assistant in all his mischievous charm. It is as if you are watching the books unfold word for word as you watch the friendly banter between Wolfe and Goodwin. The other characters are tastefully portrayed as well. It is always a crack up when Inspector Cramer comes barging in on the scene his mouth mangling his cigar.

  Other than the fact that the series is accurate, they have also kept in mind the time period of the books giving them an opportunity for artistic creativity. The dialogue is fast and hot like the old classic movies. The sets are beautiful, colorful, and accurate for the time. The music is funky and fun keeping the scenes light hearted and hilarious. It is also unique and fascinating to see how they use the same actors and actresses to play various roles in each episode. Overall, the presentation of the episodes is full of classic American entertainment.

  Seriously, I do not see how anyone who is a fan (or not)could have anything to say against this series. It is one of the best series A&E has put out there. However, there is only one disppointing thing. A&E only made TWO SEASONS! As you watch these fantastic episodes you will mourn over the fact that it was cancelled. I believed they cancelled it because no one seemed to be watching it, but it was hardly on the air long enough for people to hear about it let alone watch it. I believe A&E has totally screwed up on this one and I shall weep for the many episodes they could have made.

  Anyway, I urge anyone who reads my review to buy this series. You will not be sorry.",1155081600,14,1898,4.6083086053412465

2471885,5,B000CRR3CE,"A&E's ""Nero Wolfe"" was one of the best TV series I saw in the last five or six years, and it's really too bad, as all the other reviewers have noted, that the channel didn't carry on with the show past 20 episodes.  I eagerly grabbed all of the discs off Netflix when the series became available on DVD a couple of years back, but at that time the single-season box sets were too expensive for me to buy.  Therefore, it's most satisfactory :) to have them all together in one place, along with the pilot movie.  The costuming is superb - one gets struck all over again by how much more elegantly people dressed in the late 1940's and early 1950's than they tend to do today - and the relationship between Chaykin's Wolfe and Hutton's Goodwin is an unending joy to watch.",1152403200,36,770,4.333333333333333

8101147,5,B000CRR3CE,"Rex Stout wrote 33 novels and 39 novellas featuring his rotund private detective between 1934 and 1975, yet the big screen depictions have been minimal. Several television projects have struggled to find a network home despite serious actors such as Orson Welles lining up to play the title character.  I suspect that if Stout had been british and wrote the quixotic character as living in Londons west end he would have been as beloved as Christies Poirot has proven to be over the years.  But the truth is that americans seem to like their televised private detectives to be either con artist charmers (Jim Rockford / Thomas Magnum) or hard nosed tough guys who brawl and shoot there way through a mystery (Travis McGee / Lew Archer / Mike Hammer, etc.).  Dealing with an orchid loving gourmand who is a borderline agoraphobic and generally quarrelsome with everyone he encounters is a tough way to draw in a weekly audience.... tough that is until 2001 when A&E put their Nero Wolfe on Sunday nights.

This series stars Maury Chaykin as Nero and Tim Hutton as his sometimes reluctant assistant, Archie Goodwin.  The balance of the cast is built around a small, but exceptional ensemble that play both recurring and one off characters as the stories dictate. Nero and Archie get on each other's nerves on more than a few occasions and their relationship verges from employee - employer  to a sort of domestic cold war that bubbles just under the surface.  The rest of the household consists of Fritz, the chef / housekeeper and Theo, the unseen gardener who tends Wolfe's rooftop greenhouse. A few guest stars show up, but their roles tend to be interesting minor characters rather than overplayed ego trips designed to drive ratings.  A typical example would be that of the late Carrie Fisher playing a frumpy button maker who thwarts Archies best efforts to track her whereabouts.  All told this 8 disc set includes nine 90 minute feature films including the pilot, The Golden Spiders (which is on the last disc for some inexplicable reason) along with twelve 45 minute episodes from the novellas.  Three of the feature length films are shown in two parts of 45 minutes each while the balance are an un-interrupted 90 minutes each. Additionally, theres a reprise of The Silent Speaker shown in 16 x 9 format and a 20 minute short on the making of the series.

Despite its NYC backdrop the series was filmed in LA and Toronto and done at a time when A&E was still producing quality material.  Unlike the William Conrad series from 1981 this collection is true to the source and is set in the 1950s with convincing time period authenticity (a few exceptions), elaborate sets, and great attention to detail.  Most, if not all, of the episodes were directed by Tim Hutton and he clearly has a flair for this sort of tongue in cheek flummery (a Nero-ism).  Its noteworthy that his father, the late Jim Hutton, starred in a rather good Ellery Queen in the 1970s that was innovative in it's own right.  I have both the Conrad series and this production, and though they share a few episode titles there really is no comparison between the two.  Some of the disparity stems from the 20 years between when each was made, but the biggest difference boils down to good writing, a budget sufficient to produce a convincing backdrop, and an absolutely stellar ensemble cast.  The only deficit is that A&E ran out of money long before the series ran out of stories to film.",1524182400,,3463,4.725913621262459

8101151,5,B000CRR3CE,"What Jim Hutton did for Ellery Queen, Timothy Hutton did for Nero Wolfe.  This Wolfe does not go out for strolls or go on about how someone rises from a chair.  Plots are followed extremely well and quite a great deal of the script actually comes from Stout's books.  The only thing I can pick at is they have a set of actors and use them for each story.  Rather disconcerting, but the quality of the series forgives that.  Would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys Rex Stout.",1522627200,,480,4.348314606741573
8101152,5,B000CRR3CE,"I liked the series. I wish that the A&E Pilot was on the first disk instead of on the last disk as it would have made more sense that way. In the Making of Nero Wolfe feature on the last disk, it was said that the producers opted to set the series in the 50s because it was a very colorful time, and indeed it was.

Without giving away any of the stories or plots, what I liked about the series was how Timothy Hutton (Archie Goodwin) and Maury Chaykin (Nero Wolfe) played off each other well. Colin Fox (Fritz) does an excellent job as well as does Kari Matchett (Covert Affairs). Many of the supporting cast member (players) who were on most of the episodes had challenging & perhaps fun roles playing different characters. Again it was a fun show to watch & now I am looking forward to reading the novels until there is a reboot of the series, but how do you top this series?

Prior to this I had seen two other Nero Wolfe features, a 1977 movie starring Thayer David that did not air until December 1979 (17 months after Thayer David had died), and 14 episodes starring William Conrad as Nero Wolfe & Lee Horsley as Archie Goodwin set in 1981. Both the ABC pilot and the later Conrad/Horsley series appear on this complete series DVD https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072F3Z8TG. I can see now that the 1981 release was not the same as the 2001 A&E release, but in the back of my head it's still Nero Wolfe and was also fun to watch.

Getting back to the A&E pilot movie and the subsequent 2 season run only makes me want to find the books that Rex Stout wrote as well as the ones commissioned by his estate after his death.",1522022400,,1628,4.348684210526316
