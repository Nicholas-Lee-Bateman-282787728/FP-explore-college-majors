7455905,4,B0162VLYJG,"The concert is good featuring some good album tracks from AYNIN.  The David Lynch stuff is at times just background, at times really cool, and sometimes really annoying and stupid.  But so it goes.  Anyhow, for a concert dvd, this one is more inspired than the Manchester show that came out as A Diamond in the Mind.",1448409600,2,316,4.508771929824562

7455907,5,B0162VLYJG,"Have you been with a beautiful girl completely naked on the bed asking you...Do me what you want!!!,..of course, she expecting you will be a magical lover, but instead you put glue on all her body and after that flour, feather, and god's know what else, and you run away thinking you did the joke of the year!!...wow!!  but nothing about to be a magical lover at all!!,. well, Duran Duran ask this artist the same, expecting from him to make a incredible artwork!!...but we got this.

Any way, why the 5star? just because after watch the video and check that it is not possible to get an alternative flat version what I'll do is just rip it on audio since this show has many astonishing song version, like friend of mine, a view to a kill etc.

So, arriba Duran Duran y gracias!, los amo.",1447372800,9,788,4.383561643835616
7455908,5,B0162VLYJG,"Up front, know that I love *everything* Duran Duran. I'm giving this 5 stars only because ""All You Need Is Now"" is a great album! However, I vacillated between love and hate with this videoand its not DDs fault. I should have gotten the big clue when I saw David Lynch associated with it. WTH was he thinking with all his stylized crap? (Anyone remember Twin Peaks?) Reach Up For the Sunrise is one of the best songs on the album, but the little creepy dolls completely ruined it for me. Next time I watch it, it will be audio only.

I just wish they would have done Mediterraneaeven if David ruined it. ;-)",1472601600,2,607,4.324561403508772

7455910,5,B0162VLYJG,A great DVD from one of my favorite bands. I really enjoyed the concert and there interaction with other performers. It was a good purchase for this Duran Duran fan!,1464825600,,165,4.533333333333333

7455913,5,B0162VLYJG,"A fantastic concert film with far-out footage from David Lynch.  A friend and I enjoyed it immensely, although we could have done without some of the weirder images Lynch superimposed during the songs, such as hot dogs on a grill, clay heads, mice puppets, and Barbies. Still, the band was incredible, with solid guest vocalists and musicians.",1458518400,2,343,5.017543859649122

7455916,1,B0162VLYJG,"I love DURAN DURAN!!! I went to the theater to see this film so excited for the outcome. What I got was a lot of headache spinning graphics super imposed over the band. It was beyond distracting. At one point there are sock puppets and a barbecue with a spatula hitting the grill in beat with the music. The concert footage was amazing and if it was just a concert film I would have given it 5 billion stars. The guest stars were excellent, the band was excellent. David Lynch ruined what could have been an amazing film. AND I have to wonder what the band were thinking too. This is unwatchable at best. I swore that I was not going to buy this but I knew I would because it is Duran and I have been a die hard fan since I was 13. At 47, I just can't say this was a great film. I am buying strictly on the premise of the additional interviews etc. from the band. At least it was under $20. I would hate to have to spend even more money on this unwatchable film. IF people have given this a 5 star review, they are supporting the band blindly or must really enjoy sock puppets superimposed over the band or hot dogs and spatulas. It was not a great film.",1450137600,4,1154,4.0881057268722465
7455917,1,B0162VLYJG,"TERRIBLE. I LOVE Duran Duran, but the graphics super-imposed over the band are distracting, weird and sometimes downright laughable. Stop-motion Barbies? Really? Once again, the band is AMAZING, this video.. not so much.",1449273600,6,220,5.696969696969697

8735451,5,B0162VLYJG,"Very good concert performance by the band, unique treatment by director David Lynch. In his typically eccentric fashion, he superimposed unusual and weird images onto the concert footage, creating something quite interesting! The TRT of 102 minutes listed here and on the DVD box is an error. It clocks in at exactly 113 minutes, as correctly listed on the Blu-ray version, the Blu-ray sold by Amazon US is, however, an ""on demand"" BD-R, not a real pressed disk. The Blu-ray does have DTS-HD Master audio, versus the lossy Dolby Digital audio of the DVD.",1503360000,,554,4.904255319148936

8735455,3,B0162VLYJG,"....first off they are trying so hard to distract you from the fact Andy Taylor is not with them that the replacement guitarist would have a hard time convincing his friend he's actually in this!  Excellent job of hiding his face for most of it. (It's the third song in before there is a glimpse of his face)

And for most of their careers they did such a great job providing their own background vocals live that the addition of hired female vocals outside of the band just seems......rather lazy.

And the addition of ""guest"" modern artists in an attempt to add some manufactured relevance seems desperate. The fans want to hear Duran Duran not ""guests"".

I suggest the two dvd live from London instead.",1491350400,4,705,4.616
8735456,4,B0162VLYJG,"This DVD is part of the American Express concert series. This particular concert was filmed by the artsy-fartsy David Lynch, who unfortunately reduced an otherwise amazing concert by Duran Duran who performed a great set, including some rare songs that they have not played in decades, and several guest artists. Lynch filmed the March 23, 2011 concert in L.A. in black and white with distracting images and odd, eccentric videography. I personally think that the 2012 DVD ""A Diamond in the Mind: 2011""  (filmed in Manchester on December 16, 2011) is a better take of the same 2011-2012 concert tour. It is a better Duran Duran experience which showcases the band's greatness. Still, this DVD is worth buying for the sake of the music alone!",1486598400,3,741,4.928
