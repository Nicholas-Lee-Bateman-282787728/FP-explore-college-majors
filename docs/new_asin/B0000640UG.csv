1697491,5,B0000640UG,"Teletubbies is the first tv show that my kids were able to focus on.  (Elmo was a close second.)  They were able to pay attention to it for long periods of time as early as six-months old.  I have since collected all the Teletubbies available on DVD.  This particular one is a favorite just because it is the longest.  The main feature is 100 minutes long, plus it comes with two bonus featurettes.  One bonus is a ""music video"" of the theme song, which is just a montage of clips.  The other bonus is really an entire 30-minute episode intended to encourage exercise.  (The Teletubbies reach up, reach down, sit, stand, etc.)  When you count the main feature and bonuses you've got well over two-hours of entertainment for your preschooler.  This is one of the videos we grab over and over for long car trips with the portable DVD player.",1139702400,3,839,4.533333333333333
1697492,4,B0000640UG,"Another reviewer wrote ""I see nothing to gain with Teletubbies except a blank stare from your child where there was no input other than watching guys in suits run around and play.""

Well, all I have to say is that it's for toddlers. My daughter who is now 7 grew up on these and she's at the head of her class. I'm lettitng my 18mo. old son watch them too. We made learning a fun, optional thing, and now she loves it. I've seen kids who were crammed learning and info and they started hating it when they realized school was the same thing.

This is entertainment, pure and simple. Kids need a few years just for their brains to get in gear. Are you the type of parent who makes your kids sit and watch you do flashcards when their brains are incapable of processing most of the info you give them?

I started learning stuff when I was 3 and I'm fairly intelligent with an IQ in the mid hundreds. I am not making my kids ""learn"" until they are actually capable of it. Most people I know don't have many memories from before 30 months or so.

Should I cram information into my kids that they won't remember, or should I spend the first few years with them showing them I love them and that there's more to life than acheiving things?

Get a grip. Let your kids have fun their first few years. They have the rest of their life to compete and be miserable. I'm not saying my way is right, but children should be given many routes to be the best and maybe mindlessly watching Teletubbies when they're 1,2&3 will help them. It definately hasn't hurt anyone.

Also, for the guy who reviewed it and gave a film critic review about it complaining about the music and production values. Right-on man. Too bad my 18mo. old son doesn't notice this.",1102291200,8,1738,4.315950920245399
1697493,5,B0000640UG,"I admit...I was skeptical to allow my daughter access to TV 'too soon', but one morning on PBS, she became enchanted by the Teletubbies, and it's been bliss ever since.  We have quite a few Baby Einstein tapes and DVDs in our repertoire, but Teletubbies brought a new and different vantage point to my 11 & 1/2 month old's 'TV time'.  The characters are colorful and silly (our favorite segment - adults and baby alike - is 'Secret Dance'...very amusing!) and I liked the fact that there is a segment from the creators of the Teletubbies geared toward curious parents (like me) who want to know more about what their kids are learning by watching.  And there are bonus segments galore, which makes this a bargain in my eyes.
We have since purchased some other Teletubbies DVDs ('Baby Animals' and 'Look!') and are equally pleased.  It's nice to feel confident in adding this programming into our video library.  Enjoy!",1055808000,16,918,4.748427672955975
1697494,3,B0000640UG,"My 2 year old cannot get enough of the teletubbies.  I only bought this dvd because PBS moved the show to a time before he wakes up in the morning.  I don't care much for the DVD (too focused on girls not enough for my son to relate to).  But my son is watching it for the second time today so I can't complain too much.  I think the show is better than the DVD in being educational, not much in the regular program on this one that teaches anything which is why I like PBS programs to begin with!",1048032000,4,497,3.94
1697495,5,B0000640UG,"I have personally always been a fan of the brightly colored creatures called ""Teletubbies"" (much to the dismay of my adult friends and family).
I now have a one year old daughter and she is enthralled by the colorful images and rhythmic songs on the ""Silly Songs and Funny Dances"" DVD.  Though her favorite thing to do is ""read"" books, she loves ""interacting"" with the ""sun baby"" and enjoys nearly every part of the DVD.  She was initially frightened by the sound of the violin playing Baa Baa Black Sheep (she cried in fear the first time until I held her and the second time she was noticeably uneasy but did not cry), but aside from that, she cannot get enough of the Teletubbies' SSFD DVD.
My daughter has always been interested in music and movement/dance (it runs in the family) so SSFD wasn't used an introduction to music/dance (as it is for many) in our case.  Nonetheless, my daughter is still captivated by this movie (she is a very active baby and will actually sit down and watch this movie for 20 minutes at time).  I wouldn't at all call it ""mindless"", in fact, it's very educational (as educational as a young child needs).
Wonderful bonus materials include a 30 or so minute video entitled ""GO"" (kind of an exercise video of sorts for toddlers, complete with cool-down) and an interview with the creators of Teletubbies that offers insight into how the Teletubbies came to be and their intended purpose.
I definitely give this DVD five out of five stars and if my daughter could, she'd do the same!",1028764800,15,1515,4.6
