8461330,3,B0058BKVWS,"This was transferred to DVD from Video Cassette.  A lot of it was taped in the late 1980's, early '90's I think.  It is useful in that there is information on the discs which is NOT in the textbook and vice-versa.  It IS a useful companion to the textbook as certain rules of flight just don't change.

I recommend it reluctantly to an extent because of its age.  If it were updated, I'd highly recommend it.  It IS hard to top Jeppessen products.  For example, ASA gives them a good run for the money.

I don't know.  You call it.  I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it and there IS a LOT of useful information in it.  There is actually an item contained in it that I somewhat disagree with:  the disagreement is not a matter of aerodynamic givens that it would be wise not to challenge in flight, or otherwise, and not related directly to aerodynamics per se.  My take on it it requires some explanation.  I'll save that for consideration by students when I become a CFI myself.  It is not a hard-fast FAA Reg. and you won't find it in the FAR/AIM, but I digress.

I guess I recommend it.  The copyright on my copy is I think 2002, possibly 2009, so you might want to check the year of release, whether its been updated etc.  If it's not too expensive for you, I'd say get it anyway.  I would buy it again.  I'm just saying there's ""some"" room for improvement to this item.",1360454400,5,1374,4.211538461538462
8461331,1,B0058BKVWS,"I teach a video-based private pilot ground school at a Part 141 school.  It is appalling to me that Jeppesen has not updated these videos in all of these years.  They were filmed in the early 90's at best, and some of the information has changed since then (though not a lot of it).  Nonetheless, it does not show our student pilot population that we take flying very seriously when a part 141 school is bound to these ancient videos.",1347321600,3,434,4.4
8461332,1,B0058BKVWS,"I think learning to fly is excited, but unfortunately these videos are anything but. I bought them to help supplement my ground instruction as I am currently earning my private pilots license but I can't stay awake through these videos, poor sound quality, monotone descriptions, and very old and dated style. I expected a lot better for the price.",1346025600,5,348,4.915254237288136
8461333,2,B0058BKVWS,"I ordered this DVD series to supplement the Jeppesen Private Pilot I purchased through my FBO.  The textbook and syllabus indicated this video series would help the learning process.  While the information presented in these videos is still accurate, the videos themselves are quite dated (guessing made in the mid-80s).  MyPilotstore had the best price, but after viewing the DVDs, it's hard to comprehend how Jeppesen can justify charging the price they do for an item that is in desperate need of updating.  If 80's mall hair, cheesy music, and watching L1011s and 727s taxi around ""today's modern airports"" is your thing, then you'll get your money's worth.",1343088000,6,661,5.092592592592593
