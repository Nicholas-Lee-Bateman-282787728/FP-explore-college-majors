And even if there were theoretically a god the universe doesn't need one to be created, One simply question to prove that is asking yourself if the ideas of the Big Bang is for some people ""pathetic"" because you can't get a universe from nothing ask that about God? How do you get a universal creater from nothing?",1422489600,,361,4.484848484848484
8544428,3,B009UHH408,"Stephen Hawking seems to believe that the universe was created from a black hole in which he believes there is no time. So his theory is that God could not have created the Universe because there was no time to create it. What he doesn't seem to realize is that God lives outside of time. Time is made for humans to live under. God has lived since eternity past and will live to eternity future. So I hate to say it but God had plenty of opportunities to create as many universes as he wanted to.

This program focuses on the Big Bang and to me that only serves to prove that God spoke creation into existence. Otherwise I don't think this program fully explains where all the matter came from to create the universe.

So in the end Stephen Hawking basically says that nothing caused the Big Bang. I simply can't believe that. It is not logical to me. Only God doesn't have a beginning. Everything else is his creation. So in my mind I still believe that God spoke matter and energy into existence.

The more I study about the brain or about the natural world the more convinced I am that there is a God and he is preparing something for us in the next life. Stephen Hawking believes there is no heaven. How sad for him. In this world you need something to look forward to. Seeing all the beautiful galaxies in this video also made me think God is a real artist.

So if you watch this also read the account of Creation in Genesis of the Bible. And the laws of nature spoken of in this video...why could God not have created them too? I believe he is far more intelligent than we could ever imagine. Science simply discovers what God already put in place.

And even if Stephen Hawking was correct about the universe coming from a black hole he'd have to also explain where the star that collapsed first came from. And would there really be enough matter in one collapsed star to create billions of stars. That alone does not seem possible.

Watch this and you'll never have any more questions about the origin of tour universe (and the possibility of many others).  Oops, I know I'm wrong because the majority of people on this planet are seriously deluded and don't WANT to accept scientific proof about the non-existence of God, even those with a good education whom I respect, like the Clintons and President Obama.",1403395200,,452,4.947368421052632
