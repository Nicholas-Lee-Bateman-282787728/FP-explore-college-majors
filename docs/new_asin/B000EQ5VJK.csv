2528884,5,B000EQ5VJK,"I was excited when WWE decided to revive an old WCW traditional PPV when it was expanding the number of PPV's back in 2004.  The first GAB was weak and last year's was not much better.  With WWE holding 15 PPV's a year, each one needs to have a little unique qualities to it.  WWE did nothing more than use an old WCW PPV name and slap it on another boring, run-of-the-mill Smackdown PPV.  If they want to put on a quality PPV and respect the WCW tradition (GAB, US Belt, etc.), WAR GAMES should headline every GAB as a tradition (like Fall Brawl used to every year in WCW from 1993-1998).  RAW has the ELIMINATION CHAMBER that is becoming a staple at New Year's Revolution, so what does Smackdown have?  I'm not one to invent my own card and post them as my ""predictions"", but just imagine:  ""SmackDown presents The Great American Bash 2006""

Main Event:

WAR GAMES

Batista, Rey Mysterio, Chris Benoit & Undertaker

  london and kendrick vs noble and kash

this was a very good tag team match and was given a good amount of time(arouind 13 minutes)and it also exceded my expectations 9/10

  us championship match

  finlay vs william regal

this match was disappointing considering who was in it and unlike the crowd, I didn't care if bobby lashey was in this match or not. The crowd chanted boring because they wanted a dull powerhouse wrestler(lashley) to totally dominate this match (I hate it when the crowd doesn't appreciate a good match). Also the leprachaun ruined the match a bit. 7/10

Gregorey helms vs matt hardy

this was a good match but since these two were put into a match a day or so before the pay per view, there was no importance to this match. 7/10

  punjabi prison match

undertaker vs big show

with or without kali, this match would suck and it did, only two tables were used and the match consisted of headbuts and puches.extremely boring. 1/10

bra and panties match

just a terrible match. None of the divas in this match could wrestle. DUD

Btista vs mr. keneddy

this was an okay match, nothing special. 6/10

  world heavyweight championship match

king booker vs rey mysterio

this was a good match, but it was too similar to the match they had on smackdown just a few days before the ppv. it was exremley stupid to have the main event of this ppv be the main event of smackdown just a few days before the ppv. Therefore this match was too similar to their smackdown match and felt like you were watching the exact same match you did on smackdown, but still and good match and thank god mysterio is not champion anymore, he was a jobber and a sorry excuse of a champion. Also chavo turning on mysterio was too predictable. 8/10

overall, this was a decent ppv and is worth a rent. 3/5",1155513600,3,1835,4.4787878787878785

2528967,4,B000EQ5VJK,"Pitbulls vs. London & Kendrick

A very good tag match that was high flying and didn't contain too many of the regular tag match clichs.

RATING: 81/100

Finlay vs. Regal

This match wasn't as good as I hoped it would be as nothing much really happened in its 11 minutes. Not bad at all just a bit boring for my liking.

RATING: 75/100

Hardy vs. Helms

This was a good match. I don't know why the cruiserweight title wasn't on the line considering weight obviously doesn't matter with titles in WWE. It had good back and forth action and was won at the 12 minute mark via a roll up by Helms (with the tights).

RATING: 81/100

Undertaker vs. Big Show

This match really was going to be unpredictable. I am pleased to say that it definitely wasn't as bad as it could have been but it also wasn't as good as it could have been. Big Show wrestling instead of Khali was a good thing and the match was indeed more than watchable because of it. It was given a lot of time (21 minutes) but unfortunately so much more could have happened in that time. There were no submission holds or any of the Undertaker's moves from his arsenal. I liked the way the ""prison"" was incorporated into the match thus making this match a breath of fresh air. Good to see the Deadman win creatively before Khali could screw him. Not HIAC material, but much better than a singles match would have potentially been.

RATING: 86/100

Bra & Panties Match

Nothing special. Quite crap in fact.

RATING: 55/100

Batista vs. Kennedy

A very intense match. This was going very nicely but the disqualification ending left a lot to be desired match quality-wise. A nice flurry of rage after the match from Batista though.

RATING: 77/100

Booker vs. Rey

I was expecting a lot more from this match. This wasn't too different from their foolish decision of a Smackdown match. The ending came from one hell of a chair shot by Chavo and it looks like they are going to feud again. I don't know if giving Booker the title is a wise choice but its sad to see the title off Rey again.

RATING: 81/100

536/700 = 77%

Overall Impression = 73%

75% - Pretty good matches on this PPV but nothing great enough to get a 90%. The overall impression was affected slightly by the slightly disappointing Booker title victory.

2528969,3,B000EQ5VJK,"i saw it all free on utube, but buying it is out of the question, last year's was better, some ok matches

1) tag titles- (champs) london & Kendrick vs the pitbulls
kid kash and jamie noble won single matches against them, but because kash is going to take some time off is a reason why they weren't successful, but maybe cause london and kendrick are so awesome, most talented wrestlers in the wwe. they did a double dive through the ropes. kendrick did a outside cross body, kendrick came in with calf kicks and elbows all around. the pitbulls were using ground techhniques. london went to go skin the cat, but noble dropkicked down. kendrick landed a hurricanranna, missle dropkick. in the end, kendrick had noble in a sunset flip position, and london got a nice dropsault and kendrick got the pin- 4/5
winners: still champs london and kendrick

2) US title- (champ) finlay vs william regal
it was supposed to be a triple threat with lashley, but he was hurt, so it became a one-on-one by teddy long, so two friends would be against each othher. they got into a tie up, and they wouldn't let go, and they started walking around under the ropes, by the barricade, up the stairs, it was weird and crazy. the leprechaun was biting regal's finger, and finlay capitalized on that, hit regal with a shalaley in the leg and then started chasing regal around the ring. funny stuff. they started going back and forth with european uppercuts to they were to their knees. finlay was doing some good unique moves, and his classics like [...] drop and getting regal caught up in the apron and beating him up. reagl got his front half nelson belly to belly t-bone drop suplex. the leprechaun then took off regal's boot, so finlay can stomp on the injury. then the leprechaun gave finlay the boot, and finlay hit regal with it and got the ropes for the win- 3.5/5
winner: still champ Finlay

3) cruiserweight title- (champ) gregory helms vs ?
it turned out to be matt hardy. it was supposed to be super crazy, but he was hurt. ok match, gregory got a side spinning neeckbreaker from the top rope, a wierd arm hook spinning drop, an arm hook submission hold with knees to the shoulder, and a shining wizard. matt got a sideffect, matt second rope elbow. the end was helms dropping hardy on the turnbuckle after a 10 punch in the corner and grabbed the tights- 3/5
winner: still champ gregory helms

4) punjabi prison- undertaker vs great khali-NO!- the big show
big show attacked taker backstage and teddy changed the match, well khali was hurt. show had a confrontation at SNME and match that was unresolved at ecw, so let's see who's the better man. this match is not for the ecw title. the prison was like 2 tall bamboo sticks, the one around the ring was smaller and had 4 mini doors. u can open the door whwnever, you have 60 seconds to get out or else the door closes and you have to try another. the match wasn't really good, just a normal match. show got a superplex on taker. taker got out on the 3rd door, and show got out on the 4th and threw taker back in. taker climbed back over. u had to escape the other cage now, except there was no way to. taker got a legdrop to big show through some kind of table, taker climbed up and jumped onto show and they fall backward through the cage, causing taker to win-2/5
winner: undertaker

5) [...]- krystal marshall vs michelle mcCool vs jillian vs ashley. these ladies have been all over each other lately, in jealousy and tag matches. the person to take off someone's top and bottoms is the winner, no elimination.
there was actually some wrestling in this match suprisingly, most the match it was michelle and jillian in the ring battling and the other two diva's on the outside. michelle got a whiplash backbreaker on ashley, jillian kneed michelle to hell, and got a scoop slam, went to the top but krystal knocked her down into tree of woe, krystal and michelle turned on each other, michelle was thrown to the otuside, jillian started shaking her [...] and put krystal's face into them and then grabbed her by the legs and ashley took her top off- 3/5- hot!
winner: ashley, jillian was upset cause she did all the work, then they both celbrated by taking off each other's bottom. it's good that jillian is good now, cause she's the hottest and best wrestler, in my opinion.

6) batista vs Mr. kennedy
it was supposed to be henry, but he was injured, that's the pattern all night. so batista takes his frustration out on kennedy. by busting him open, and choking him out in the corner with his boot to be disqualified, then got 3 spinebuster's and a batista bomb afterwards- 2/5
winner: via DQ Mr. Kennedy

7) world title- (champ) rey mysterio vs king booker /w/ sharmell
they did like an overview of the wreslter and introduction of them in the ring, the started doing that now, annoying usually, but it was weird with career highlights. everyone though it was a real good match, but nothing extraordinary. rey got a hurricanranna, botched by booker, a tornado ddt, went for a cartwheel bulldog, but booker countered into a backdrop, unique, rey got a seated senton to the outside, booker got a outside crescent kick and a sidekick. Booker did the 3 amigo's, he did them good too. rey went for 619, booker moved, rey kicked him in the back of the head, then went for another, sharmell tripped him, ref saw and ejected her. rey went for a headscissor takedown, booker reversed into the ref. frog spalsh and royal book end connected, but there was no ref, both men had the match won. Then booker got a chair, rey dropkicked back into him. then chavo came out with the chair and instead of hitting booker, he hit rey. u think it would be shocking, not to me, i hoped this day would come. booker then gets the victory- 3.5/5
winner: new champ king booker, they celebrated after. even though booker is dumb right now, loses to lashley 4 times, but wins title, he deserved it. he was, after rvd did it, the best wrestler never to be the champ, until now, congrads, too bad it's going to be a short reign.

well, it was an overall average ppv, the best looking match was the worst and some good wrestling matches. so see it if u want, it's entertaining if your bored, and that's all i have to say about that.",1153958400,,6248,4.484182776801406
2529025,4,B000EQ5VJK,"London and Kendrick vs The Pittbulls: I figured  London and Kendrick would win since they lost singles matches against the Pittbulls. Still though this isn't a bad match with near pinfalls and high flying. Lond and Kendrick pick up the win but I didn't get to see how or who was pinned. I can still say that it wasn't a bad match though.

  Regal vs Finlay: Lashley is out so it became a singles match. The fans were hardly into it since it was a heel vs heel match. They brawl a lot with some technical wrestling. Plus there's some entertaining parts involving the lepricaun chasing Regal around. Still though they should've just added Sabu and made it a 3 way. Finlay obviously won this one. He wins after nailing Regal with his boot.

  Gregory Helms vs Matt Hardy: This is an ok match but Matt should've won. I mean they had him pin Ken Kennedy recently but lose to Gregory Helms ?

  The Big Show vs The Undertaker in that Prison maatch: That's right, as if there wasn't enough people taken out of the ppv, The Great Kali is taken out and replaced by the Big Show. This was probably the best of the night. Although of course Taker won. It bugs me how he takes time off after every big match he has and always comes back to win another big match or even to get a title shot. This wasn't bad match though. It was an interesting new type of cage match. Where you have escape won cage and then excape another. Both men bleed bad in the match too.

  Ken Kennedy vs Batista: Kennedy is a talented wrestler that just got back too but gee who are they gonna be more interested in putting over in this match ?? Batista bloodies Kennedy and gets DQed  and goes on to spinebuster him and Batistabomb him.

  King Booker vs Rey: Rey has many near pinfalls but gets screwed over by Chavo when the ref is knocked out. Booker doesn't even win with the scissor kick after Chavo's chair shot. He just covers him after the chair shot. So it's pretty much a weak win. I wish the WWE could've let him win without the silly All HAIL KING BOOKER gimmick. It's lame and he's about as least over as he ever was. It's funny how the WWE tends to give people the belt when they aren't as over as they once were. I mean why couldn't they have just gave him the belt years ago. Plus look for him to just drop the belt to Mr. Muscle Head Batista at SummerSlam. The ppv ends with Sharmel saying All Hail King Booker with absolutely no pop what so ever. So it's not a great end to an already just decent ppv.",1153612800,,2482,4.22457627118644

These match-ups were scheduled after the last aired Smackdown! before this PPV (pay-per-view).

Shortly after, Bobbly Lashley was removed from the Triple Threat Match for the United States Championship due to medical reasons. Originally, he was billed as Champion, but lost it 2 weeks beforehand on Smackdown!.

Previously, the #1 Contendership Match was scheduled to be a grudge match between Mark Henry and former World Heavyweight Champion Batista, however due to a knee injury at Saturday Night's Main Event 2 weeks beforehand, Henry was removed and was put on 8 months leave. Ken Kennedy was announced to be Batista's new opponent the following Friday, 2 days before the Bash.

Before this PPV, no one has any idea what a Punjabi Prison Match entails. Presumably the match would resemble a Cage match, such as Hell in a Cell.

The Tag Team Champions lost both their singles matches to the Pit Bulls on the 2 weeks prior to the Bash. London lost to Noble, Kendrick to Kash.

Gregory Helms' has become the longest reiging Cruiserweight Champion in history on the week before this PPV. His match was at the last minute announced for a mystery opponent as he was guest commentator for a match between Psicosis and Super Crazy, where he ""hopes"" his opponent is one of them.

From the lineup, this should prove to be a better PPV than the previous (Judgement Day 2006) of the Smackdown! branch.",1153526400,,1987,5.030674846625767

London and Kendrick (c) vs The Pitbulls

Winners: London and Kendrick

- It was probably the best WRESTLING match on the entire show, and since they stuck it at the beginning I was all hyped up and raring to go, although it was 1am here in England. Good moves, two or three sick spots, most noted being Noble's dropkick to London while London was doing the Shawn Michaels Royal Rumble thing. It was cool. Nice fast paced cruiserweight action.

Score: 7.5/10 - Very Good

WWE United States Championship:

Finlay (c) vs Bobby Lashley v William Regal.....

Oh Wait! Theodore Long Has Come Out! It's Now.....

Finlay (c) vs William Regal

Winner: Finlay

- The crowd absolutely tore this match apart ina  bad way. The constant ""BORING!"" and ""WE WANT LSHLEY"" chants did my head in. Just deal with it, the guy's injured. The fact is, although I'm concerned for Bobby's well-being, the match would now be better. Two great veterans who compliment each other well will have a really good match. Until, that Leprachaun keeps getting Regal. Was well funny though. As JBL put it, this was a brawl, and a damn good one at that. I want a rematch though. They know and I know that they can do better. If the crowd weren't ruining the vibe, this would be way better, but it was hard because they are both heels.....for now.

Rating: 7/10 - Still very good.

Gregory Helms vs Matt Hardy

Winner: Helms

- Yeah, you would think it would make more sense to make it a Cruiserweight title match against a Mexicool or even S2H but no no no, this is WWE we are talking about. I was annoyed, but this match turned out to be alright, just alright, with Helms carrying Hardy. JBL's (true shoot-like) commentary made it better. Hade some cool spots. Brought down the crowd even further though. No suprise there.

Rating: 5.5/10 - Can't do any better really

Punjabi Prison Match:

Undertaker vs The Great Khali w/ Daivari

Oh Wait! It's Theodore Long again! It's now.....

Undertaker vs Big Show!

Winner: The Deadman

- I could write a novel on this match, since there were many good bits and many flaws. The cage idea is top notch, something different, and it was needed. The structure itself makes you think if anyone would survive. Since there were video packages highlighting Khali and stuff, it hyped it up to be helacious and brutal - and I mean brutal. I thought this had bloodbath written all over it, but then Big Show replaces him due to backstage beatings. I was left with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. Then, you realise that Khali can't wrestle, and Show can, which makes the match work a hell of a lot better, and what a match it turned out to be. It was a brawl, and even Taker bladed - a rare sight! The better man won of course, after the smashing through tables and smacking against bamboo, in a bodged-up finish by the Big Slow. You have to see it to understand. It was one of the most embarassing moments, I feel, has happened in WWE, hence why the finish wasn't action replayed. Otherwise good.

Rating: 8/10 - Brutal, which is what the doctor ordered.

4 Way Bra and Panties Match:

Kristal vs Ashley vs Jillian vs Michelle McCool

Winner: Ashley

- Listen, if I wanted to watch ""Adult Entertainment"", I'd download it, not watch this plastic fest. Only one pretty lady in that match in my opinion (begins with an A) and she won, which Jillian was a bit miffed to, since she did all the work. Heel turn possibly? No-one cares.

Rating: 2/10 - I don't care. Bring On The Pain!!!

Batista vs Mr Kennedy.....Kennedy

Winner: KENNEDY!!!! (By DQ :( )

- Dave Batista is a moron. He Makes Kennedy bleed everywhere, then he gets disqualified because he can't remember to count to five. What a moron. Then he mucks up a Batista bomb on the heroic Kennedy. I really didn't like this match. Would've been way more electifying with Mark Henry, but his legs finally gave way due to the mass they've been carrying for 20 years. It was going to happen sooner or later. I'm suprised he didn't fall throught the ring when it happened. Anyway, poor poor ""squash"" match.

Rating: 4/10 - Not fair on Kennedy.....Kennedy.

World Heavyweight Title Match:

King Booker vs Rey Mysterio (c)

Winner: ALL HAIL KING BOOKER!

- The thing which did my head in is that we saw the match on the previous Smackdown which was a stupid thing to do, and it was 330 in the morning and i kept falling asleep because of that. There was no hook. Good match though none the less. It was hard for it to steal the show though because of previous good-quality matches. Stupid finish with Chavo Guerrero getting involved, especially since I don't give a damn about him in the first place. All Hail the King! Would've much prefered a scissors kick ending. Mysterio's best title match to date (well that's not hard) and finally, Smackdown can get back on track.

Rating: 7/10 - All Hail.

Overall, it is much better that '04 and '05 but the crowd just sucked all atmosphere up like a giant vacuum so the entire show seemed more stale than it actually was. Due to like 1000 injuries and the fact smackdown has no roster compared to Raw anyway, I was happy with the outcome. Good effort from WWE, but with everything being mucked up with replacements, it is not a must-see as such.",1147478400,,5263,4.524312896405919

8113081,5,B000EQ5VJK,"One of the greatest Smackdown PPV's. Booker T vs Rey was a great main event from start to finish. Booker T winning was great. For a long time Booker T was blackballed as a WCW guy and he finally worked his way to a World title win. WWE always went out of their way to bury him like Jim Ross saying Booker T is no Ric Flair. No s*** JR but Booker T was the backbone of WCW helping WCW beat WWE in The Monday Night Wars as TV Champ. Anyways Booker T's greatness was validated.

Big Show vs Taker was a great match these guys always put on great matches being 2 of the greatest big men in Wresting history. Show can be known to be lazy but Taker will make him work hard and always got a good match out of him.

Finlay vs Regal. These guys had a great match. They have wrestled each other for years in WCW and they couldn't have a bad match if they tried.

Batista vs Mr Kennedy was a great match. It was too bad Kennedy left WWE he seemed to be headed in the right direction but what went down went down. Batista and him were a great matchup. I really enjoy matches between these two guys. Two of the top guys on Smackdown.

Matt Hardy vs Greg Helms was a sleeper hit match. Matt Hardy has always been a good worker and Helms was always underrated. They wrestled this match with a lot of passion.

  In the end 5 stars I love Booker and Rey match and Booker finally get his title win he deserved. Taker Show match was great too and Batista vs Kennedy was awesome. I strongly reccomend this ppv!",1460678400,,1491,4.068259385665529
8113082,2,B000EQ5VJK,"WWE presented ""The Great American Bash"" six times from 2004 to 2009.  Although they continued to improve over time, something stupid always seemed to tarnish the rest of a good card.

In 2004, two Match-of-the-Year candidates were overshadowed by forgettable undercard matches and a murder.

In 2005, any good part that came out of that PPV was tarnished by a sleep-inducing main event that went on forever and ended with a cheap finish.

In 2006 --- as we'll explore here --- the whole event is comprised of switcharoos and last-minute changes.

I actually like the 2007-2009 editions, especially the 2009 PPV (which most people hate).  But after this debacle, you'd never guess that ""The Great American Bash"" was worth bringing back.

1) WWE Tag Team Championships
Paul London & Brian Kendrick (champions) v. The Pitbulls
---For better or worse, JBL said that these four guys could steal the show.  I won't go quite that far, but this opening contest was one of my favorite matches on the card.  Jamie Noble & Kid Kash are equally as talented as the champs, giving this one a dose of Cruiserweight juice.  It's a little slower-paced than you might think, but I've come to realize that patient action can be more gratifying.  I really didn't like the 2006 ""Bash"", but I'll admit this kickoff made it easier to swallow.
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

2) United States Championship
Finlay (champion) v. William Regal
---The advertised Triple Threat Match also including Bobby Lashley didn't take place, but I give credit to the ""SmackDown"" team for trying to give this turn-of-events some depth.  Lashley pleaded to wrestle, but was denied, much to the dismay of fans.  Unfortunately, I was astonished that Finlay and Regal pretty much bored me from bell to bell.  It wasn't because Lashley wasn't involved.  It wasn't because both men were bad guys.  It wasn't because the advertised match was changed.  Quite frankly, Finlay and Regal were such amazing technicians I don't know why after three viewings I can't get into this one.  It just moves at a plodding pace, and seemingly goes nowhere.  Folks, I would pay to watch a Regal/Finlay match anytime, but trust me, this one isn't as good as hardcore fans want it to be.
""5.0 / 10""

3) Matt Hardy v. Gregory Helms (Cruiserweight champion)
---As much as I would've loved to see Super Crazy take on Helms for the belt, I have to admit that their ""Judgment Day 2006"" encounter didn't blow me away like I'd hoped.  Besides, Matt Hardy and Helms have much better chemistry.  This is a last-minute change that worked, in my opinion.  With all respect to the dazzling athletics of Super Crazy, Matt Hardy was starting to hit his stride on ""SmackDown"" TV, and deserved some kind of PPV exposure.  With the seesaw action we saw, I'd bet ""SmackDown"" viewers were happy with the result.
""7.0 / 10""

4) Punjabi Prison Match
Big Show (ECW World champion) v. The Undertaker
---This is the match that will probably make or break ""Bash 2006"" for people.  As limited as The Great Khali was, his dominance over Undertaker was refreshing, in my opinion.  I was looking forward to seeing how Taker & Khali would pull off this debut of the Punjabi Prison Match.  After some non-sensical brawling backstage, Big Show as punished to be Khali's replacement.  I strongly believe that even though Big Show and Taker had some good matches before this night, people were bored of Big Show once he became ECW's champion.  But never mind that analysis, this match just sucks.  It's just an endless barrage of punching, clotheslines, and slams...with some bamboo shenanigans thrown in.  Both men bled and broke through a table, and the match still sucked.  This is one of the most boring matches I've ever seen, and the storyline behind makes it even dumber.
""2.0 / 10""
______________________________________

5) Bra-and-Panties Elimination Match
Jillian Hall v. Michelle McCool v. Kristal v. Ashley Masarro
---I'm gonna catch all kinds of crap for liking this one more than the Punjabi Prison Match.  But you know what, at least these ladies gave me something pleasing to the eyes.  I dare say that there've been good Bra-and-Panties Matches before, but this isn't one of them.  What can I say?  Sometimes I like them, and sometimes they bore me.  This one didn't do much for me.  But I can't fault the ladies for trying.
""3.0 / 10""
______________________________________

6) #1 Contender Match
Batista v. Mr. Kennedy
---Another change to the PPV, as a 7-month buildup was derailed when Mark Henry got injured.  I gotta admit that at this point in time, Batista was very boring, so seeing him go against a smaller opponent like Kennedy was refreshing.  Besides, wouldn't you rather see loudmouth Kennedy get the crap kicked out of him, rather than seeing two mammoths just slug away?  The big problem with this match is that it's too short, and that we didn't have enough time to care about the match before it took place.  But for what it was, it kept my attention.  Big props for the unexpected outcome, too.
""5.5 / 10""

7) World Heavyweight Championship
King Booker v. Rey Mysterio (champion)
---Thankfully, this dismal PPV is bookended by a very good main event.  Say what you will about Mysterio's 1st title run, but he went out under very good circumstances.  King Booker was quickly becoming an easy-to-hate villain, Chavo Guerrero's betrayal was cemented with one of WWE's hardest chairshots, and the contest itself was very good.  Both men went back and forth, giving each other a run for their money.  Even though these two squared off just days before their advertised PPV contest, it was still worth my time back in 2006.  Unfortunately, King Booker's matches as champion were pretty dull, and the Rey/Chavo feud went into some distasteful territory.  But at the time, I thought ""Great American Bash 2006"" came to a very strong close.  I still do.
""7.0 / 10""
______________________________________

""Great American Bash 2006"" is sandwiched between two huge problems:
1) Everything you wanted to see on this PPV didn't take place
2) Most of what resulted from this PPV was a letdown.

Seriously, think about that for a moment.
* The U.S. Title Triple Threat could've been salvaged if Finlay & William Regal, two great technicians, didn't bore just about everybody.
* The Punjabi Prison Match was a tough sell to begin with, made worse when Big Show was brought into the mix.  I dare say that Great Khali and Undertaker would've had a better match together.
* Batista and Mark Henry had 7 months of history, and instead we got a one-sided squash.  Also, Kennedy's victory didn't matter, since Batista became the #1 Contender anyway.
* While Booker and Mysterio had a very good main event together, Booker's title run resulted in some very disappointing matches, while the Mysterio/Chavo angle wasn't either man's best.

2006 was a rough year for the WWE.  Want proof?  Give this ""Great American Bash"" a look.",1282435200,,7115,4.993203058623619
8113083,3,B000EQ5VJK,"My SmackDown steak continues as this was the best Great American Bash that WWE has pulled off yet.  It's funny how RAW gets more effort put into it yet SmackDown has the events that are worth watching.  The Great American Bash in the past two years of the WWE has usually been one of the worst (if not, the WORST) PPV of the year & it looked like the same way with a lot of last minute changes (CARD IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!) but it still came off good.

Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. Kid Kash & Jamie Noble - Sorry but out of respect to the ORIGINAL PITBULLS (from ECW), I won't call Kash & Noble by that name.  It's no secret that I'm a fan of crusierweight action & you got that here in the tag team division.  Great opening match that was actually given time to turn into something good.

United States Champion Finlay vs. William Regal - Lashley couldn't wrestle due to health issues so it was just a singles match.  This was unique in the fact that both guys were heels so the fans didn't know who to cheer at times and that these guys were just two straight up wrestlers so it was a good wrestling match.  Finlay's ""little [...]"" got involved at times to keep the match humorous (Regal has priceless facial expressions) but overall, it was a good wrestling match.

Crusierweight Champion Gregory Helms vs. Matt Hardy - Hardy replaced Super Crazy who also had some health issues but again, it was a nice match.  For those trivia buffs, Hardy & Helms grew up together & actually started wrestling together back in their OMEGA promotion along with Jeff Hardy & Shannon Moore.  This was a case of both guys can wrestle & go in the ring when they are allowed to do so & it didn't disappoint here.

Punjabi Prison Match: Undertaker vs. Big Show - Talk about a bait & switch because it leaked out on the internet for a week that Khali couldn't wrestle due to health issues, they kept advertising Khali before the ring entrances when Big Show took his place.  The prison was created out of bamboo & looked similar to the ""Kennel From Hell"" (Hell In A Cell & a steel cage match in one).  The match rules were a unique concept in which that you had 60 sec. to escape through a trap door in the first cage that had spikes at the top of it and then escape the second cage to win the match.  Undertaker & Show did their best & it was better than the original ""Kennel From Hell"" match with Al Snow & Boss Man but still, we've seen better performances from these two.

Four Way Bra & Panties Match: Ashley vs. Krystal vs. Michelle McCool vs. Jillian Hall - It's a bra & panties match...what can be said that hasn't been said already about bra & panties matches for the last 5 years.

Batista vs. Mr. Kennedy...Kennedy (sorry, just had to do that) - It was suppose to be Mark Henry but he got injured (surprise surprise!!!) so Mr. Kennedy stepped in at the last minute but he was nothing more than a body for Batista to completely massacre.  Kennedy got a few shots in but the match was all Batista & he ended up getting disqualified but Kennedy was the ultimate loser as his head was just absolutely bloody.

World (Heavyweight) Champion Rey Mysterio vs. King Booker - The match was actually really good but it was nothing more than a setup for the heavily teased (and predictable) heel turn of Chavo Guerrero on Rey Mysterio.  Booker became the most deserving World Champion in WWE since Chris Benoit.

DVD extras included a Paul Heyman talking to Big Show after the match & King Booker's celebration on SmackDown followed by his match with Rey Mysterio on SmackDown which was very similar to their Bash match with the same ending of Chavo Guerrero costing Mysterio the match.

Again, third time is the charm as this was the best Great American Bash that WWE has put on.  I recommend.",1160092800,9,3796,4.3914285714285715

In one point in the match i thoguht this was going to end qucik but they gave this a strong 15 minutes to devolp. Back and forth actioon and lots of high flying moves by kendrick and london. Great action and good amtch. WInners and still wwe tag team champs Brian Kendrick and paul london. MAtch Rating 8.5/10.

2. Finlay vs. William Regal for the wwe us title- This is a hard match to describe. I would say that i was expecting alot more out of this match than i got. Nice promo by lashey before the match. Another thing that i did not like was the fact that i kenw who was going to win. Okay match with soild wrestling and funny apprences by little bastard. Winner and still wwe us champ Finlay. MAtch RAting 6.5/10.

3. Gregory helms vs. Matt hArdy for the wwe crusierwieght title- This origanly was supposed to be crazy vs. HYelms but it turned out to be hardy which was not a bad choice.

WInner and still wwe crusierwieght champ Gregory helms. match RAting 7.5/10.

4. Undertaker vs. Big Show on a pujambi prison match- This was a different kind of a match.  I did not know what to expect of this at first but it turned out ok. I liked the fact of the new rules which added to the match. It started out slow but when they got out tof the first part of the cage like thing there were some nice table spots. WInner Undertaker. MAtch RAting 7/10.

5. Ashely vs. kristal vs. Michael Mcool vs. Jillian in a four way bra and panties match- This was a bad match. That is when this comes to wrestling wise. If u were talking about how hot the girsl looked it was good but there was no wrestling involved here and not that bad because they needed this match to slow the crowd down after that last match. WInner Ashely. MAtch Rating 3/10.

6. Batistia vs. Ken Kenndy- This was a good match to start  off. Right from the bought this was brutal. Right from ythe get go there was blood poring from kenndedys head its was disgusting.

7. Rey Mysterio vs. King Booker for the WHT- This was a great way to close off the show. SOme people might think i am over rating this but i really liked htis match. It started out ok and the entrences took a little long but after that it was awsome. Just a great pace and storyline to the matchand booker did not dominate the whole match. Lots of near falls and great back and forth action. A sick chair shot by chavo at the end of the match. WInner and new WHC King Booker . MAtch RAting 9/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give the great american bash 2006 a grade of 48/70 which is a 68% which means this is a good ppv. Iw ould say that this bash beats all of the others sience 2004 by alot not an awsome ppv but worth a look. If u can tell me if my review was helpful or not i would appreicate that.
