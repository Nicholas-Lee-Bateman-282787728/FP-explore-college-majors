8219033,1,B000VJE1JQ,NASCAR FANS SAVE YOUR MONEY!  This as well as others i've bought from nascar super store are almost un-watchable.  It's almost like some kid with a 8mm camera filmed these races.  These are not what was televised.  Had any TV station aired these NASCAR would never be where it is today.  The cars are white and black most of the time they are on screen.  They are just silhouettes from the sun glare.  I have been watching NASCAR since 1984 and I know personally this is not what was televised.  Even some of the newer races look this bad.  How could NASCAR get the money to grow as they did if fans couldn't see the fancy color schemes or even the number on the cars.  And the sound is also equally as bad.  I can't suggest strongly enough how much of a waste these tapes are.,1239753600,3,777,4.2534246575342465
8219034,4,B000VJE1JQ,"It's great that these old races are becoming available for the die-hard NASCAR fan. Great footage and video quality but something was definitely wrong with the sound the whole way through. The broadcast sound was distorted and Chris Economaki sounded like he was on a telephone. I know of, and have seen better audio feeds so I'm not sure why the sound is off on this one. I would have given this a five star if the audio was decent.",1207872000,,433,4.425
