7835870,5,6303047149,"This is a  MUST WATCH for students of fashion design...the history of Chanel style influenced half a century of fashion!! Her flair for innovation, her outspoken opinion on the length of a skirt...she was truly a force with a perfect eye for style. I laughed, and argued with her while she told her story.
