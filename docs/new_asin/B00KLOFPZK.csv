8659825,5,B00KLOFPZK,"As I post this review I see one before me from someone named Central Coaster. He describes himself as the biggest Nobuyuki Tsujii fan on this side of the ocean. Well, Im a lot different from CC. I honestly was not familiar with this amazing BLIND SINCE BIRTH classical pianist and have never seen or heard him play. And, because of that this 70 minute documentary may even more relevant to me. I enjoy classical music but its not my primary genre. But also love a well-produced documentary film. Director Peter Rosen has woven archival video -Nobuyukis mom started videotaping him from birth  with performances in piano competitions and a performance at Carnegie Hall. Im not a big fan of spoilers so I won't tell you the story but rather say that you have never seen a prodigy like this young Japanese man.

The film was co-produced by German Television and a Japanese firm. The film is in both Japanese and English (and the English subtitles are (thankfully) easy to read.  Most of the musical performances are excerpts but there are a few full performances. The only weakness I found was that the title of the compositions is not displayed on the screen. They are only listed in the closing credits. Its a minor deficiency but it would have been helpful.  I also had an question which was unanswered in the film  but is probably easy to research on the internet. We see Nobuyukis mother through much of the film but his father is never discussed. A father is an important part of a boys growing up and, unless I missed it (possible!) he is never discussed.

The Bluray images are gorgeous and the sound is wonderful. Though most of the musical selections are by the great masters, we also hear a composition composed by Nobuyuki. Its gorgeous!  This young man (he was playing his toy piano at age 2 and won a competition while in the First Grade!

The BD comes with a 16 page booklet which contains photos as well as a 2  page essay  in English, German and French.

Surprisingly there are no bonus features (outtakes; full performances) but the documentary alone is worth seeing if you have any interest in either classical music or, like me, well-made documentaries!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8659826,5,B00KLOFPZK,"I will preface this review by admitting that I am one of the biggest fans of Nobuyuki Tsujii (Nobu) this side of the Pacific Ocean, but I strive  to be as objective as possible in presenting my opinions below.

This is the third documentary by Peter Rosen on Nobu, the other two are ""A surprise in Texas"" (2009)  and ""Nobuyuki Tsujii Live at Carnegie Hall"" (2011).  Unlike the other two, this film does not take place at one single location, but it is instead a collage of old and new footage about Nobu taken in different times and places.  It does a good job of sharing background information on Nobu that is not well known outside Japan.  Nobu, pianist virtuoso blind from birth, is beloved in Japan, where documentaries about him are shown regularly on television.  Some of the footage from this film is borrowed from those documentaries, but thankfully shown with excellent English subtitles. Also, those who have already seen Rosen's previous two documentaries on Nobu should be prepared to see some familiar footage.  However, to the credit of the filmmakers, there are little touches added for interest.  For example, with the excerpt from the 2011 Carnegie Hall debut documentary, we are told why Nobu shed tears on stage at the end of that performance.

It is a nice touch that the narration of this film is by some of those closest to Nobu: his mother (Itsuko Tsujii), his childhood piano teacher (Masahiro Kawakami), and Nobu's tour manager (Naoyuki/Nick Asano).  Their words, Japanese accents notwithstanding, lend authenticity to the presentation.  I do wish that their names were shown on screen when each first appears in the film; they deserve that recognition.

The documentary consists of nine chapters, titled Early Childhood, First Achievements, Studying Techniques, International Competitions,  Traveling around the World, Inspiration, Music and Hope, Tohoku Earthquake 2011, and ""Flowers Bloom"".  I was especially pleased to see the segment about Nobu's ""studying technique"", which clearly describes Nobu's unusual method of learning complex music works by listening to audio scores specially prepared for him, a technique pioneered by his childhood teacher.  I hope this footage will serve to dispel, once and for all, misinformation about how Nobu learns music that he cannot see.

Although there are brief segments sprinkled throughout the video, those looking for footage of serious classical music performances by Nobu may be disappointed.  As a compensation, we have cinma vrit footage filmed by Peter Rosen when in 2013 he accompanied Nobu on concert tours in the U.S. and in Japan; the scenes that he captured are insightful, moving, and sometimes humorous.

""Nobu does not talk much,"" says his manager in the film.  The young pianist prefers to express himself through music.  This documentary speaks for him and, thanks to the subtitles and narrations, it gives those of us outside Japan a comprehensible look into the world of the extraordinary Nobuyuki Tsujii.",1407110400,9,2995,5.159420289855072
