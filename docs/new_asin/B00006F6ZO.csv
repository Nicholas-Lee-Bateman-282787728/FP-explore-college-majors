1752611,5,B00006F6ZO,I love this series. If you liked the first you'll enjoy the second as well. Terrific acting and writing. Very funny and touching moments. Well done Albert Finney!,1171238400,2,162,4.821428571428571
1752612,5,B00006F6ZO,"Funny, poignant, and familiar. I loved Uncle Silas as if he were my own rougish relative. I felt transported back to a quiet, simple English countryside where you knew your neighbors, sometimes too well. I shared the sense of adventure and fun with Silas' young nephew who sometimes unwittingly became a partner in crime. My only complaint is that Series one IS NOT available on DVD. I have both on tape, but want both on DVD!",1140307200,5,426,4.618421052631579
1752613,5,B00006F6ZO,"My Uncle Silas series 2 staring Albert Finney is a great look at the relationship that can develop between a young boy and his older although not especially wiser great uncle.  As Uncle Silas, Finney is excellent at showing his great nephew Edward, played wonderfully by Joe Prospero, the way not to carry on as a proper gentleman.  Although set in England in the time before World War 1 the stories and the lessons that they teach are timeless.  Take the time and sit back and relax and enjoy the delightful tales that playout in this series.",1072569600,9,543,4.577319587628866

7968161,5,B00006F6ZO,"Love it, we'll watch again and again",1427673600,,36,4.285714285714286
7968162,1,B00006F6ZO,"Give it only 1 star due to what is written on the back of the DVD:  ""...a loveable raunchy rogue; Silas always finds time to indulge in his two greatest loves: women and home-made wine---the combination of which constantly lands him in hot water.""  Wish we hadn't ordered it.  However, if it doesn't bother you...?!!! We did watch part of the first episode---and it was true to form as stated above.",1425340800,,399,4.591549295774648
7968163,5,B00006F6ZO,Clever. Witty. Utterly delightful. Finney was perfect choice for Uncle Silas. Tom Jones as a widower in hos 60s. Series 2 may even be better than Series 1.,1389139200,,155,4.571428571428571
7968164,4,B00006F6ZO,"This is the second series under this title.  I was thrilled to find it existed.  I found it funny and interesting as the the first one.  Would recommend for anyone wanting an ""English-type"" growing up series.",1382400000,,208,4.722222222222222
7968165,5,B00006F6ZO,"Have not finished watching series one yet, but, am sure that I will enjoy it, and this second series also.",1372550400,,106,4.35
7968166,5,B00006F6ZO,Highly recommended as is series 1.  You won't want to stop watching until you've viewed all 6 episodes on the disc.,1367452800,,115,4.476190476190476
7968167,1,B00006F6ZO,"I was seduced into buying this series (complete collection) by the nice picture of Uncle Silas and his cute great-nephew, and by all the reviews and catalog descriptions that used words like ""endearing"", ""heart warming"" , ""lovable"" and ""irresistibly charming"".  What we got was grotesque story telling at its worst.  It does not say much for the women who lived in rural England, circa 1900, that not only would they settle for someone as repulsive as ""Uncle Silas"", but they actually pursued him.  I do not understand why someone would be physically attracted to an overweight slob whose main goal in life, when not overeating and belching, was to drink as much homemade wine as he could and to have sexual relations with every single, married and widowed woman he took a fancy to.  The last scene of the last episode pretty much sums up the whole series:  After indulging in a day of gustatory excess, he suddenly is not feeling too well and ends up running to the outhouse with his pants around his ankles.  The scene ends with him plopping his ample backside on the toilet while his housekeeper hands him some kind of indigestion remedy.  I just hope that time will erase that ill-conceived image (and many others) from my mind.  We kept thinking the next episode would be the ""charming"" and ""heart warming"" one, but we wish we had stopped after the first one.  Save your brain for something more enlightening--why pollute it with this garbage?",1276819200,,1448,4.76
7968168,5,B00006F6ZO,"This series is such a great carry on after the first.  Laughs, and such wonderful characters!  Silas is so devious you wouldn't believe.  I only wish the first series was also available on DVD, it's only on VHS (unless you have a region free player that will output the picture in NTSC format to watch the region 2 version).",1206662400,2,324,4.4576271186440675
7968169,5,B00006F6ZO,"Watching the 2nd season without having watched the first is not a problem.  It might have been nice to have had the intro's of getting to know the characters, but each episode stands nicely on its own ... linked short stories.  Finney has a wider range than I'd realized; the whole cast is wonderful together.",1185062400,2,309,4.6
