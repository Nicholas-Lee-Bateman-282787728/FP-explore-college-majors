4855120,5,B005OY6LBE,"PUNCTURE is an apt title for this movie, a true story that pokes a hole in the corporate and governmental greed that endangers public health, and a story about the lawyer who despite poking holes in his veins as a drug addict brought to the attention of the public a safety problem of overwhelming significance. It is tautly written by Paul Danziger (a character in the story), Ela Thier and Chris Lopata and directed by Adam and Mark Kassen. It is an important film for public viewing and knowledge and awareness.

Opening this true story with a young nurse mother Vicky Rogers (Vinessa Shaw) departing for work at the hospital we witness her accidental stabbing herself with a needle while trying to calm a boisterous patient. Fast forward a few years later and we meet two law partners - Mike Weiss (Chris Evans, brilliant in a demanding role and boasting one of the most impressive physiques in cinema!) and Paul Danziger (Mark Kassen) - both seemingly committed to idealistic cases but bogged down in the routine accident settlement cases to make a living. Enter Vicky Rogers, now with full blown AIDS she contracted form the needle puncture we observed and asking Mike and Paul to take on a case of making the hospitals across the country aware of a retractable safety needle invented by engineer Jeffrey Matthew Dancort (Marshall Bell), who owns the Safety Point Company, but is unable to sell his product to any hospital from the United Medical group, apart from San Antonio Memorial. Mike and Paul are committed to Vicky and the cause and take the case on, only to be blindsided by hospital purchasing agents who want to save the hospital money and not buy the slightly more expensive safety needle. As the young men take on the horrors of the case they encounter the powerhouse lawyer Nathaniel Price (Brett Cullen) who represents the stonewall of United Medical. The money in the office of the young lawyers runs out and Paul wants to pass the case on to another law group, but Mike wants to keep the case, gathers mountains of evidence to prove that hospitals and supply companies are preventing the distribution and sales of the safety needle. He even gains the support of Senator O'Reilly (Kate Burton) until she withdraws her support as United Medical makes a huge contribution to her campaign!

Complicating the tense story is the fact that Mike is addicted to cocaine, pain pills and heroin and his addiction is constantly resulting in his being late and missing deadlines. At the point where Mike decides to give in despite his idealistic motives to win the case the story ends with a staggering reality. The results of the story are given on the screen before the credits role.

This is a very strong story, well directed an written, and in many ways due to the bravura performance of Chris Evans drives home some realities we all need to acknowledge: money and greed speak louder than patient and hospital staff safety. Food for thought. Grady Harp, January 12",1325808000,,2980,4.78252427184466

4855123,4,B005OY6LBE,"I've seen many of the reviews -- and the movie's own advertising -- compare this movie to ""Erin Brockovitch"", probably because that was such a box office hit, but I think a better comparison is to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-of-Genius/dp/B001LM64S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash of Genius</a>, the Greg Kinnear movie from 2008 that told the story of the inventor of the variable-speed windshield wiper for cars who ran into the same kinds of obstacles that the inventor of this movie did: big industry's refusal to accept and incorporate an invention that could enhance the safety of a product or service.

This is a David-and-Goliath story -- based on fact -- of the little-guy inventor of safety hypodermics taking on the healthcare industry giant that refuses to accept his product in the marketplace because it would interfere with market forces already in place.

Chris Evans plays the druggie/lawyer who takes on the case, heading a cast of little-known actors, all of whom turn in excellent and captivating performances.

Everything about this movie works; the writing, directing, and on-screen performances. You'll find yourself rooting for the little-guy genius as well the the everyman lawyers who represent him, one of whom (Evans) is a total junkie.

This is one of those movies that came and went at the theaters so quickly that if you stopped at the stand for a tub of popcorn it was already gone.

But give yourself a treat and watch it now that it's out on DVD.",1325635200,4,1533,5.292181069958848
4855124,5,B005OY6LBE,Had no idea about the subject matter when I started the DVD - just that it was based on a true story.  I love legal dramas and this is as fine as they come.  Engrossing - well acted. Two thumbs up.  Enjoy.,1325462400,,205,3.8333333333333335
4855125,5,B005OY6LBE,"A common incident among healthcare professionals is accidental needle puncture. Sadly, thousands of medical staff are infected every year with various forms of hepatitis, Syphilis, Herpes and AIDS because of needlestick injuries.
This movie is the true story of a lawyer who finds out about these accidents and fights to get a safer syringe used in hospitals across the country. The characters are very convincing as real people with real problems. The acting by Chris Evans, Mark Kassen and Vinessa Shaw is all incredible and I hope Chris gets an Oscar nod for his great performance.
The film keeps a fast pace and although it's a courtroom drama it's never unexciting. The filmmakers keep the style fresh and use the camera to allow the audience complete understanding of the characters thoughts.  It is a strong film with a powerful story and incredible acting.",1323216000,14,864,5.041958041958042
4855126,5,B005OY6LBE,"The Preview Trailer of the Puncture DVD seems exceptional.""Puncture"" dramatizes this dilemma with its based-on-life story about two low-rent Houston lawyers who take on the personal injury case of Vicky (Vinessa Shaw), a nurse who contracts AIDS after an accidental stick. They learn that her friend Jeffrey Danfort (Marshall Bell) has designed a retractable needle that could not stick a second person, but that the safety needle faces an unofficial national boycott by medical suppliers and hospitals who object to its slightly higher cost.  Out from behind his Captain America shield, Chris Evans proves a quirky and compelling actor as Mike Weiss, who spends most of his time doing drugs. Then he meets a hospital worker who contracted HIV from an infected syringe. This leads Mike to take on the case of a man who's invented a safe, throwaway needle that no hospital will buy, because it will cut into medical-supply profits. This true-life film is a likable oddity: a rambling, low-budget Erin Brockovich with a cokehead hero.",1323129600,4,1032,5.142857142857143
4855127,4,B005OY6LBE,"I was lucky enough to see this film when it opened and I was not disappointed. While it may have some subjective flaws, the message of the film is important. And those that see it should remember is it based on a real story; and those rarely satisfy the Hollywood-addicted among us. Real life takes turns we often don't want or expect.

I just hear about the DVD being released and I am going to preorder it when I finish this review. If you don't get distracted by what could be flaws and details that are not part of the main storyline, I think you will like this movie. I also think you will have some greater measure of your opinion of Chris Evans' acting ability. I know I do.",1322870400,16,681,4.2384615384615385
4855128,4,B005OY6LBE,"""Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest places""  This is the true story about Mike Weiss (Evans) a personal injury lawyer who takes on a huge health supply company after one of his clients is infected with a dirty needle.  The client is a nurse in a hospital that uses plastic needles that are re-used over and over.  Mike wants to make it so every hospital only uses the one time use only needles that his other client manufactures.  The only problem is that Mike is a drug addicted mess.  This movie is deceiving.  The first half hour to me was a little slow and wasn't sure if I could make it through.  When it picked up, it really picked up and sucked me in.  By the end of the movie you are very engrossed and are pulling for someone you normally wouldn't.  A movie much like ""Runaway Jury"" mixed with ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", not quite as good as ""Lincoln Lawyer"" though.  Overall, a very good law movie that will make you think.  I give it a B+.

*Also try - Lincoln Lawyer & Runaway Jury",1322611200,35,1006,4.320855614973262
4855129,3,B005OY6LBE,"The film is based on a true story.

The movie opens with a nice happy indie soundtrack. Happy mom (Vinessa Shaw as Vicky) drops her little girl off at school and smiles as she goes to work in a hospital trauma ward. A man is wheeled in struggling, a bad PCP reaction. Mom tries to inject the patient only to get pricked herself with a contaminated HIV needle, hence the title of the film, ""puncture."" After the credits we see a trial lawyer (not hard to guess how these two subplots come together) who is in a cheap motel with 2 sleazy looking women and large amounts of cocaine. He is going over his next court case. Chris Evans stars as Mike Weiss, a lawyer with his own demons.

Nurse Vicky is already being compensated for her injury so there really isn't a case for her. However Mom is on a crusade. A one time disposable syringe has been developed that has a retractable needle that would prevent workers from getting infected...and hospitals won't even look at them as an option because of how their group purchasing operates. The non-charismatic manufacturer of the needle says, ""Is there anyway we can sue a hospital for not buying something that saves people's lives?"" While smoking a crack pipe with a naked woman, Mike gets an idea. He discovers that there has been 800,000 needle punctures to health care workers in the US. In investigating why hospitals won't buy this needle, he breaks out the large ""Glen Beck conspiracy board"" and draws lines and connects dots and discovers large corporations, payoffs, kickbacks, and a few well placed politicians.

The film reminded me of an absurd ""Erin Brockovich."" Unlike ""Erin Brockovich"" we really don't feel for the victims. At one point Mike is late for a meeting and while in the restroom he develops a ""too much nose candy"" nose bleed. What should be a great drama turns out to be a mediocre screen play with lack luster performances. It is interesting and entertaining from an historical and political sense, but fails as a drama. When the movie starts to grab you, they roll the end credits.

F-bomb, brief nudity, lots of drug use",1321660800,,2095,4.654054054054054

4855131,1,B005OY6LBE,"FYI - Slight spoiler alert:  The only good part of this movie was the last 10-15 minutes where the plaintiff's law managed to get a big corporation to back down and settle out of court because the defense attorneys knew they were gonna lose.  That's the gist of it. I wouldn't buy it or even rent it again because it was pretty much a waste of the $2.99 I spent to rent it. Ok that's it, I'm done.",1480809600,,397,4.076923076923077

Evans plays a young lawyer in a small, flailing law firm who takes on a corporate behemoth at no small cost to his personal life and the life of his partner in the firm.  And it's based on a true story.

Streamed this movie on a whim and I'm so glad I did.  It's a well-written, well-acted, well-shot film that has you rooting for a self-destructive underdog, emphasis on self-destructive.

Again, highly recommended.",1449273600,,586,4.989690721649485
4855146,5,B005OY6LBE,This movie is very powerful! It made me inspired in a way I haven't been in quite some time. Chris Evans plays his character with so much passion I actually burst into tears when it ended.,1447027200,,188,4.25
4855147,4,B005OY6LBE,"Courtroom dramas are always good fodder for film, particularly when you incorporate the David and Goliath scenario. This is better than average but maybe not as much for the plot as for Chris Evans' character.

Here's the scoop. An E.R. nurse is accidentally stuck with a syringe while trying to inject a patient. She becomes infected with HIV as a result. She contacts the law firm of Danziger and Weiss, not so much for herself, but because she knows someone who has invented a ""safety syringe"" which will all but eliminate anyone ever getting accidentally stuck again. But he cannot get his invention to market because the industry is sewn up, and outsiders, no matter how great their product, are not allowed in.

This is based on a true story and it is interesting in and of itself. But what is really happening here is Chris Evans. His Mike Weiss character is  about as original as they come. He's a brilliant lawyer but is deeply addicted to drugs, and whores. The drugs don't seem to effect his ability to think through complex legal issues but it has screwed up his life otherwise. His wife has divorced him. His house is a mess and he has no head for the details needed to run a daily existence. He works the case knowing the guns against him are huge and that these bad guys can win by attrition. Evans and his partner simply do not have the funds for a long haul. Add to that the fact that the safe syringe's inventor is a cantankerous old dog and it is a tough go.

As I said, the story is good enough and has a rather surprising ending. But Evans' partner Danziger (Mark Kassen) wasn't drawn all that well. He just couldn't stand up to Evans' performance. Brett Cullen does well as the chief bad lawyer who you just love to hate. Marshall Bell also does a decent job as the syringe inventor Jeffrey Dancourt. The production values were as good as they needed to be for this type of outing, so it is an easy watch in that regard.

This might not be quite worth the four stars I gave it but it is worth the viewer's time just to see Chris Evans. If you are into this sort of film, you could do a lot worse.",1446940800,,2118,4.351898734177215
4855148,5,B005OY6LBE,"Any movie that exposes truth or makes you think differently about ANY issue is one that I like. This one does that about the medical community, HIV, and medical devices.

4855189,4,B005OY6LBE,"This grossly over-looked film is the important real-life story about corruption in the medical supplies industry and its effect on both hospital care providers in the United States and the spread of AIDS worldwide. I'm a huge fan of the Marvel Avengers series and their spin-offs and I enjoy watching my favorite characters in completely different roles. Evans is amazing in this role that in no way resembles his well known hero Captain America - or does it? Evans portrays small-time Texas attorney Mike Weiss who, in theory, is as about as unlikable a person as you can imagine. He's a functioning drug-addict who is constantly screwing up his own personal and professional life, along with his partner's and their clients'. It's his drug use, however, that helps him understand the effects that medical purchasing corruption is having on a much wider global scale. Understanding  the significance of the industry's unwillingness to adopt safety needles becomes a personal crusade that just could bring out the hero in Weiss, save himself and the planet, so to speak. Sadly the premise behind this movie is an all too common story in many of America's industries. But in the end, profits and back-patting always rule out over what is best in the consumer's interest. The only thing preventing me from giving this movie a 5-star rating is the excessive use of profanity which I always find distracting. But given that it's rated R and the subject matter, perhaps I should have expected that.",1426377600,4,1493,4.972

4855195,4,B005OY6LBE,"Puncture is a film that not only chronicles a much needed change regarding safety for medical workers, but also helped to further that cause. Brilliantly crafted by Adam Kassen and Mark Kassen based upon the story told by attorney Paul Danzinger, there is a lot about this film that shows spectacular artistry. The story begins with the nurse who is infected with HIV during an emergency room crisis in the midst of the opening credits.

 The central character is Mike Weiss, played by Chris Evans. Weiss is a dedicated attorney who wants to do the right thing. For reasons who aren't told, he is a hard core drug addict, heroin, cocaine, weed, booze and prescription pills. Evans performance is on such a level that our focus shifts from the issue at hand in the film to his character. It is clear that Evans is his generations finest, most skilled actor. Every single move and gesture is perfection. His performance in Puncture is reminiscent of Meryl Streep in Silkwood. Except that the character of Mike Weiss becomes the central focus of the film and the issue of small time attorney fighting Corporate and Political America becomes a back drop for the story of Michael Weiss, which is, when all is said and done, far more powerful than any other moment of the film.

 The fault, if you can call it that, is not entirely about Chris Evans unparalleled acting, it is written directly into the script; it is filmed and edited thus. The end result is a powerful vehicle film with one of the most brilliant performances seen on film in decades, in a story that claims to be reminiscent of Erin Brockovich. There is not an element to this film, no matter how well done, that can equal the performance of Chris Evans and as a result, we care far more for him than his cause or the other characters in the film. Thats not always a bad thing. Seeing Evans perform a piece that is worthy of his skill is reason enough to see this film more than once. Because of Evans good looks and the current trend toward block buster comic book films, Evans is most famous for The Fantastic Four and Captain America. Hidden on the shelves of Indie films are his remarkable performances here, with London and The Loss of A Tear Drop Diamond, the recent discovery of an unseen Tennessee Williams screenplay at last produced.

 The editing is particularly good, using creative and powerful angles and short flashes of imagery, infused with a careful score that is not intrusive but complimentary. It is, perhaps, a remarkable work of art and only through a critics eye does it seem that the central point of the film is unclear. Regardless, to see Chris Evans performance is close to awesome. His is an honest and brilliant performance, never overdone, never fake. Keep your eye on this young man, not just in regard to Puncture but in anything he may do in the future. So where this film teaches us a bit about front line medical care, Puncture is above all, a character study, whether that was the intent or not.",1418342400,3,2994,4.618421052631579

Sure, he wanted to get paid, but his moral compass was pointing him in the direction of ethical responsibility.  And, Evans played this conflicted character quite well.

4855217,5,B005OY6LBE,"I watched this because I was curious to see what other acting Chris Evans had done besides certain broader roles. I saw hints of some really great acting in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America-The-First-Avenger-HD/dp/B005ZB91KY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America: The First Avenger [HD</a>] but I only picked up on that on subsequent viewings (his acting is really good, but it got buried in the hype of a superhero movie).

In Puncture he not only carries the film, but his acting is allowed to really shine. I was really able to believe him as this character--which considering I had just rewatched Captain America, says something.

He plays an attorney who's life seems to be in a bit of chaotic shambles. His wife has left him, he parties with the fringes of society and is a very, very heavy drug user. All of that being said, he is a very interesting character. He uses his friends as mock trial participants to come up with brilliant legal ideas. He is very, very smart, but just seems unable to deal with the world around him in a way that isn't self destructive.

He is partners in a small law firm that helps a larger firm with cases to make ends meet. While doing this a case is brought to them about a nurse who contracted AIDS from a needle jab in the ER. She doesn't want compensation, she wants to get a needle into hospitals that a friend of hers invented. This needle would prevent an accident like hers from happening again.

Mike, Chris Evans' character, is immediately touched by her story and wants to help. His partner, the more pragmatic and practical of the two, points out that they are ill equipped to take on hospitals and the medical supply industry. Mike is unable to leave the crusade alone.

Its an intense movie and had me absorbed from the beginning. I was honestly skeptical when I hit play, but I really don't regret it. I wish there more movies out there like it. It is based on a true story--and it is one that should get told. It shows how money has made its way into holding people's safety hostage.

If Chris Evans continues to make movies like this as well as Captain America--well, he really is going to be an actor to contend with. Watching this made me wish Netflix had more of his work to stream. He makes interesting choices with his movies, now that he has the ability to pick things and I am curious to see what else he will do.

The other actors in this are all very believable, and the direction has an appropriate level of grittiness and intimacy that is needed for this story.  I also, really liked the soundtrack.",1379548800,,2629,4.724890829694323

4855221,4,B005OY6LBE,"This movie came out around the same time as Captain America yet I hadn't heard of it at all, which I found kind of intriguing (either it was total crap or it was an underexposed sleeper). I only initially heard of it because an actress I like makes a very short appearance in it, and I had a free Saturday so I figured I'd check it out.

  At first I was worried that I might be in for a boring ride, as the plot lays down its foundations and then jumps ahead 3 years with a ""based on a true story"" caption popping up in the middle of the screen. Thankfully, this was not what happened.

  The story is so immersive that I actually found myself getting nervous along with the characters, each victory they earned I reveled in, each failure they met brought personal disappointment. The subject matter is also interesting. The movie definitely brought to light a great many things about healthcare industry politics that I didn't know before, and I can blame this movie on the half a dozen browser tabs I have open right now researching the issues it brought up. As this is a ""fightin' the man"" story, corporate goons are at the heart of the antagonism here, and it's quite frightening what a firm grip they have on the system that seems to be set up to funnel the maximum amount of money back into their pockets despite the danger it poses to millions worldwide. If it weren't trying to tell a story that actually happened I'd say it was a movie warning about the dangers of treating medical care as a business. This IS based on a true story, so the ending is going to naturally fall fairly short of wrapping things up completely. If it's a David and Goliath story, it's one where David slings the first stone and only manages to pelt the hearty giant in the arm... oh and it would have to be set in a universe where everybody doesn't already know the ending to David and Goliath.

  As far as the performances are concerned, no one should ever call Chris Evans ""just another pretty face"", and this movie does a good job of showing just why that is (even if he is shirtless half the time). The characters are all written with very believable dialogue and the parts are very well played, no overacting, forced drama or dull performances here. The conflicting personalities of the two leads isn't showcased so much as a yin and yang thing as it is them having different priorities due to their life situations, where Danziger is an expectant father, Weiss is a live-in-the-moment party guy enjoying the decadence of youth, yet it never goes so far as to devolve into a full on Starsky and Hutch act. As the movie plays out, more focus is put on Chris Evans' character than his partner, and I'm not sure if this was a directorial choice or they just needed to wrap up the story really fast. The other characters are still doing things in the background, and we are informed of what they're doing, but the last half hour or so is just the camera following Chris Evans around and seeing what he's doing and who he's talking to. I guess we know why it's just him and a syringe on the cover.

  All in all it's an enjoyable movie with well-played characters, though it should be noted that it feels like only part of a story rather than one whole story to be enjoyed on its own.",1364601600,2,3271,4.397350993377484

This is based on a true story, and it is one of those movies where the ending will stay with you for a long time. It's a great drama, and a fantastic performance by the cast.",1361750400,,472,4.197802197802198
4855224,4,B005OY6LBE,"Boy, we sure need more movies like this, that humanize the rampant corruption that still runs throughout our society at all levels, but especially at the highest big money level. Well written and directed, Puncture moves well and has very few slow or dead spots, and rarely preaches. By far the highlight is Evans' bravura performance as Weiss, a serious drug addict and devoted legal mind, who comes off as far more lovable and understandable than most actors could ever hope to convey.

It's a tough role easy to overdo, but Evans just nails it in every way, and takes many over the top scenes and makes them quite real. It's darn near Oscar quality, in fact. A beautiful tribute to a most fascinating soul, even though the drug use is truly over the top and hardly endearing. If watching someone slowly implode on drugs will trouble you, then this film will trouble you, as it never shies away from Weiss' intense addiction, to all and sundry pills and powders. Sad to see.

Everyone else is at least good here, especially Brett Cullen, perfect as the rich foil lawyer far beyond scruples. He embodies the profit at all costs attitude that still runs big business.

The blu-ray looks good but has zero extra features, a real drag as I would love to hear a commentary or see a doc about how this was adapted from the true story.
Perhaps legal issues prevented that? In any case, an unfortunately missed opportunity.

[Spoilers coming...] One thing I felt let down by was the supposed ""victory"" ending, a Pyrrhic victory at best, as the big shot lawyer shows up to battle the other big shot lawyer, and wins, and the screen tells us that the big medical murder firm paid off a 150 million lawsuit, like that's some sort of victory after millions dead due to their greed. 150 billion wouldn't be enough. But that's how it went, and how it still goes, as the screen also notes that many hospitals here and across the world still don't use the safety needles.

Sigh. But massive thanks and kudos to those willing to invest in and make movies like this, which we need so many more of. Entertainment can entertain and educate, and Puncture does both very well.",1358380800,,2156,4.604166666666667

It is rediculous that so many of our health care workers should be in danger, and even DIE, when a perfect product exists that could end the risk. All for the sake of a few pennies.

4855232,3,B005OY6LBE,"""Puncture"" has all the subplots, complications, reversals, and other necessary ingredients for suspense. It also has some startling revelations to make about the spread of AIDS, the greed of the health care industry, and general state of the American legal and political systems. However, we aren't shown enough for this film to be really illuminating, and it's hard to tell where the facts end and where the fiction begins.

Too much time is spent on the details of Weiss's drug addiction and wild lifestyle, time that would be better devoted to the complexities of Weiss and Danziger's case against United Medical. We're asked to believe that Weiss--a real-life character--was, despite his many faults and weaknesses, a brilliant legal mind, yet there is nothing here that really bears that out. We get only brief glances at the public demonstrations and negative publicity against the healthcare providers, and more in such areas would help. Other scenes which introduce new (and important) characters are hurried and not quite earned.

Some good acting here, but unfortunately, the best of it's not from the top stars. Evans and Kassen (as the attorneys) just don't seem in-character, and much of their dialogue sounds flat and rehearsed. The really impressive role-playing comes from Vinessa Shaw (whose character deserves a lot more time in this story) and Marshall Bell as the clients in the case.

Underdeveloped as it is, ""Puncture"" remains a different sort of legal thriller and one that fans of this genre will likely find both intriguing and fairly enjoyable.",1342828800,3,1571,5.177165354330708

4855234,3,B005OY6LBE,"The ""Based on a True Story"" hook of PUNCTURE wears its welcome not too long after the first act, but it's a powerful punch of a first act. In essence, this is the tale of the small Houston personal injury law firm Danzinger and Weiss who, on behalf of a nurse dying of AIDS from an accidental needle stick, take on Big Medical and their vast monopoly over the products they produce. It's a pretty predictable tale all around from anyone who's seen pretty much any legal drama ever. The characters are pretty stock as well as the plot. We have longtime character actor Marshall Bell (from just about every film you've seen since the mid-80's) as the grizzled, ornery designer of the live-saving safety needles; Brett Cullen (most recently seen on PERSON OF INTEREST) as the slick-as-a-snake big-time defense attorney; Mark Kassen (the film's co-director, with his brother Adam) as Paul Danzinger, the responsible, practical and harried partner; Vinessa Shaw (perhaps best known for her role as ""Domino"" in Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT) as the dying nurse that kickstarts the film's tale and Michael Biehn as the shadowy and mysterious man that seems to be pursuing the protagonists, who we don't know is friend or foe. Doesn't sound very original, does it?

That's until you factor in Chris Evans as Mike Weiss, the other half of the firm. Weiss is a pretty serious drug addict as we see very early on in the film. In a dynamic introduction to his character, he's been on a bender of cocaine in a dumpy motel room and is preparing questions for a witness and practices on another user. As we also see early on, Weiss has a very unusual lifestyle (he keeps an alligator in a wading pool; he drinks health-nut juices like wheat grass while constantly abusing his body with cocaine, an assortment of pills, heroin, etc.) and is rapidly heading for a divorce presumably due to his constant affairs and his rampant drug use. But when he meets Shaw's character and sees what is going on in the medical supply industry, it becomes less about the kind of ambulance-chasing law they've been doing and more about starting something on a possibly global scale. This, of course, awakens something perhaps long dormant within him about what being a lawyer is really about.

Evans, despite his more recent star-turns as Captain America, is a consumate actor who really gives Weiss a sense of perpetual mania; when he's in motion, he is almost hyperkinetic, but when he crashes, he crashes hard. There's rarely a moment in the film where his character hits a false note, and the story is infinitely more interesting when he's on screen. As charming and energetic as Evans is, he shows a deeply vulnerable side that he rarely gets a chance to show when he isn't busy commanding superheroes.

The film does a commendable yet all-too-predictable job of showing how hard it is for a small law firm to take on a large cabal of evil corporations and their machinations and influence over other businesses, the government, and perhaps even life itself as the film's climax is met with echoes of the great Meryl Streep film SILKWOOD. All of the performances, while rote, are effective with the exception of Mark Kassen, who just seems a little out of his depth here. The film is directed with some style but the film doesn't want to take too many risks by making Weiss out to be a bad guy, or to explore the darker sides of his life in too much depth, which is sad because the film is almost clone-like in its ERIN BROCKOVICH construction and it could benefit by bringing something much more unusual to the table that really sets it apart.

Aside from Evans' performance, PUNCTURE is a take-it-or-leave-it legal drama that has moments that stay with you, but unfortunately, they're too few and far between.",1338681600,2,3778,4.737082066869301
4855235,4,B005OY6LBE,"I really liked this movie.  Until I read the reviews I didn't realize that the lead from Captain America was the lead in this movie.  To me it seemed daring that the producers made the lead a cocaine addict instead of trying for a more conventional, likeable character. The movie bears a little resembalance to Erin Brockovich: the flawed hero going against the greedy and wrong headed large law firm.  The story seems like one of the stories you would read in Texas Monthly, the Houston presented here is instantly recognizable.",1337212800,,529,4.791208791208791

4855237,4,B005OY6LBE,"In Puncture Chris Evans plays a charismatic drug addict (Mike Weiss) who is an even faster talker as a lawyer than he was on his high school debate team.  Evans charms us in the opening scene as he invites fellow drug addict strangers to stand in for his drug-induced mock trials where he rehearses cross examinations for the next day in court.  You root for this chemically-dependant smooth talker from square one.

 A little background:  The title has well-placed meaning in this story which was based on true events.  Our two protagonists take a case for a nurse who was accidently stuck by a syringe after it left the violently flailing arm of an HIV-positive patient (who was overdosing on some drug in when he arrived at the hospital).  After the subsequent development of the safety syringe called ""Safety Point""--a medical development that would make such accidents nearly impossible--no hospitals were willing to purchase the product.  Hospital employees are concerned about such accidents, which occur to the tune of 800,000 times a year in the USA and are the lead cause of HIV, hepatitis-B and hepatitis-C in health care workers.  These accidents are called ""needlesticks"" and have fueled the AIDS-epidemic in Africa as a result of needle re-use.

 Weiss and his straight-laced partner (Paul Danziger, played by Mark Kassen) have an entertaining relationship and ambulance-chasing personal injury business complete with TV ads.  Weiss barters ""focused"" days doing his job in exchange for Danziger following up on case work in his own unique style.

 At the dawn of his David and Goliath case Weiss maintains his ill-suited form indulging in cocaine ""bumps"" and handjobs from his fellow druggie-turned-office assistant...then falls asleep in the car during a critical deposition which, of course, he'll join late after nursing a bloody nose.

 The movie did not affect me emotionally.  It felt largely like the telling of an important story accompanied by a great Chris Evans performance.  My biggest criticism is that Evans--while made up to look pale, hungover, and baggy eyed throughout the movie--is in WAY too good shape for me to buy his drug-fueled self-abuse.  Had the real life Weiss ever been in such good shape, I have difficulty understanding how his body wouldn't be noticeably withered after even one month of such malnourished, under-rested, toxic behavior.

 This criticism aside, I enjoyed the movie and was impressed by Evans, who managed to deliver ""strung out and tweaky"" simultaneously with the clever charm we expect from him.  He reminds me of Val Kilmer from The Salton Sea (2002; great movie, by the way).",1332288000,,2641,5.107226107226107
4855238,5,B005OY6LBE,"No spoilers in this review, just a warning. Puncture is a real story. Puncture has drugs and nudity. It is fascinating, and although I think everyone should watch it, it must be watched by age appropriate viewers. If watching a junkie spiral is something you cannot watch, just avoid the movie, but please do some research about the subject and the topic.

I rented Puncture on Amazon Instant Video. It is a true story, and a very well made movie. Weiss and Danziger fought a good fight. Mark and Adam Kassen made a great film. I encourage anyone interested in learning how monopolies continue in the US to watch this movie, with friends. Despite the dangers of needle pricks for frontline ems and healthcare, we still see conventional plastic needles being used everyday, all over the United States. As a member of the Chicago Fire Department, I can testify that we still use them.

Puncture explains to us that needles are being reused in Africa by multiple patients. It is a tragedy that these are conventional plastic needles that cannot be sterilized like old glass syringes. Because the conventional plastic syringes do not retract and render themselves inoperable, they can be used hundreds of times thus spreading HIV and AIDS.

Puncture is an entertaining eye opener. It not only explains why hospitals continue to buy bad equipment, it also has plenty of Mike Weiss getting high and partying. A great movie with an important message. I am grateful to everyone involved in producing it, as well as Weiss, Danziger and Lanier for pursuing the companies that keep doors closed to innovation through kickbacks, lobbying, political contributions, illegal contracts, and sheer power. Puncture proves greed in NOT good, and has contributed to the spread of disease all over the world.",1332028800,7,1787,4.969899665551839

4855240,4,B005OY6LBE,"I don't know what I was expecting when I started watching it, but I was pleasantly surprised.

4855242,1,B005OY6LBE,"Not long after his turn as Captain America, Chris Evans hit theaters again, but this time in a very small, very limited release called Puncture. Based on true events, the film focuses on a pair of Houston lawyers who agree to defend an ER nurse who's been pricked by a contaminated needle. As the attorneys delve deeper into the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy that involves a widespread medical issue and the shady underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. I was willing to go with the story, which I found compelling, but I was a little reluctant to buy into the formulaic plotting that drove the narrative along. Puncture isn't quite the equivalent of The Insider, but it should get the job done for those looking for a passable potboiler featuring a rising star.",1328054400,3,774,4.7407407407407405
4855243,4,B005OY6LBE,"The creators of this movie had to make choices.  For viewers who like a artistically well-rounded film, it may have disappointed.  The larger ""point"" to Puncture was to recreate in a microcosm the protracted battle which politically and legally helped expose some of the rampant corruption in the medical supply industry.  The actual event was defused by settlement in the early 2000's.  The fact that it still strikes a nerve these days is testimony to the work we still need to do in containing the excesses of corruption in the area of commercial health care.  It is a reminder of the need for constant vigilance in an arena that too many consumers naively trust.

It's a personal thing, I guess . . . I found it a stylish, well-paced movie with a gripping plot.  Like another reviewer, I was more focused on the injustice of the stifling of the invention by corporate power and greed, than wanting a perfectly formed hero and plot resolution.  Hey, that's life.  It's not usually like a classic movie script.  Some of the peripheral characters weren't fleshed out, and the lawyers for the defense were formula villains, but I felt the inventor's helpless rage, Danziger's frustration and fear, and Weiss's alternating disconnection and intensity.  If the script was kind of jerky, well, that's the way that Weiss was probably seeing his life go by, and maybe not a bad directorial device.

4 stars for taking on a difficult story that's all too sadly been seen before, and trying it from a different angle.",1327449600,16,1510,4.810077519379845
4855244,5,B005OY6LBE,"I remember seeing the preview for this during another movie.
I'll admit, I rented it for a rather shallow reason.
Captain America Chris Evan's with facial hair. :)
For that reason alone I had to see it.
That said I was treated to an absolutely awesome movie.
In a nutshell...
The movie opens with a nurse being stuck with a needle.
A man has invented a safe needle that won't stick the user or the medical professional but hospitals won't buy it.
Enter a small law firm who takes the case.
One lawyer is the ultimate drug addict/party boy ""Evan's"".
His partner is the straight laced type.
They take the case, sue the medical industry and...no spoilers...you'll just have to rent it.
I loved it.
Amazing acting.
Fast paced and interesting direction.

4855247,4,B005OY6LBE,"An unexpectedly strong performance from Chris Evans makes PUNCTURE a compelling tale of corporate greed.  Evans who usually tackles lighter fare (FANTASTIC FOUR, PUSH, CELLULAR) plays Michael Weiss, a drug-addicted hedonistic attorney who takes on the pharmaceutical industry regarding the use of safer syringes.  His partner (well played by co-director Mark Kassan) reluctantly agrees to tackle the case but feels its ultimately unwinnable.  The film follows Weiss' determined attempt to kick his habit and win his case.
This is based on a true story and even includes real-life attorney Mark Lanier playing himself.  PUNCTURE is very realistic in its portrayal of corporate misbehavior.  Strong support comes from Marshall Bell as the developer of the new safety syringe; Brett Cullen as the arrogant attorney for the pharmaceutical company and Vinissa Shaw as the doomed nurse whose contact with an aids patient spawns Weiss' involvement.  Jesse L. Martin and Michael Biehn in small roles round out the cast.  But its Evans' brave and impassioned Weiss who carries the film.  The finale is strong and like Karen Silkwood's case, the question of how Weiss died remains a lingering mystery.",1326326400,3,1191,5.365591397849462

4855250,5,B005OY6LBE,"Excellent film. The most important thing about this film, IMHO, is that you get to see something very rarely shown in a movie - high-functioning addiction (especially opiate addiction). Many more real people are functioning addicts that popular culture and media would have us believe, because one way they stay high-functioning is by learning to hide their addictions from others. It's a tragic and wholly unnecessary high-wire act of lies and isolation. These aspects of Mike Weiss' life were handled with an steady, compassionate and objective hand in this film, and I greatly appreciate this effort on the filmmakers' part. I'm sure this was mostly out of respect for the man himself, as is right and proper. Being an addict does not render one stupid, useless, or even necessarily unreliable. Our hostile, punitive, degrading and shaming (and ultimately useless) laws and attitudes are what render addiction the tragedy that it is.

I hope that beyond the main point of the film - to reveal the greed and disregard for human life and suffering that has become somehow status quo in this country for the true disgrace that it is, and to celebrate a heroic fighter against this abomination - we can see Mike Weiss the way his friend and partner, Danziger, obviously saw him. His addiction was part of who he was, the pain and loneliness that he was constantly trying to numb in order to focus on doing something great. We human beings can't just cut away the darkest parts of ourselves and render ourselves sanitized and declawed for public consumption, regardless of the wishes of our society at large. To do that changes who we are and not for the better; it renders us creatively impotent and less than we were, and we don't get to just choose to have only the acceptable parts of ourselves. Most of all, WE SHOULDN'T WISH TO. Furthermore, IT NEVER WORKS.",1325808000,4,1861,4.83385579937304
