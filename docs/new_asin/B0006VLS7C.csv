8043617,5,B0006VLS7C,"Tramp, the family dog, is considered an integral part of the all-male Douglas household. The idea of a large and loveable shaggy dog, flopping and barking around the house as if it were his own, was probably inspired by the fact that both Fred MacMurray (Steve Douglas) and Tim Considine (Mike Douglas) had starred in The Shaggy Dog (1959). Tramp, the uncontested lady's man of the Douglas clan, becomes the father of puppies and walks down the aisle at both Robbie's wedding and Steve's wedding. Variety, in calling the cast of My Three Sons ""likeable and attractive,"" added, ""that praise goes for the big mutt, too."" The role of Tramp was convincingly played by Spud the dog.

This Collector's Edition includes:

1. Small Adventure (Air Date March 23, 1961): On a quiet Saturday morning, the Douglas family is awakened with a bang. Things get explosive around the Douglas household when Tramp comes home with a stick of dynamite - unleashing a small adventure.

2. Tramp - the Hero (Air Date October 26, 1961): When Chip's friend shows off his new German Shepherd, trained to do every trick in the book, Chip becomes acutely aware of how dumb and stupid Tramp is. The Douglas family tries to give Tramp a crash course to save Chip's pride, but the shaggy mutt fails miserably - until there's a fire in the kitchen.

3. It's a Dog's Life (Air Date March 18, 1965): When things start disappearing around the Douglas house, Steve blames the missing blueprints and home-baked cookies on his own absent-mindedness. Of course, the real culprit is tramp, but nobody figures that out until Steve is on the brink of a nervous breakdown.

4. Tramp and the Prince (Air Date April 15, 1965): When the boys find a stray cat, Tramp runs away from home and winds up taking the place of an upscale shaggy mutt in a neighbor's house, while his well-trained regal look-alike joins the Douglas household. Note: The ever versatile Tramp plays a dual role in this episode, displaying his fine acting talents.",1342310400,,1989,4.770348837209302
8043618,5,B0006VLS7C,"This was the most incredible idea placed before a 50's/60's idealized audience.  ""A widower father raising his sons aided by another male relative.""  Yet, as only Fred McMurray can do, it is pulled off in the highest quality of family problem-solving togetherness.  Yes, this is a bit campy in its perfectionism, but ya gotta admit, folks, sometimes we just need to see someone who knows how to get along.

This VHS contains four episodes:  1.)  ""Chip Off the Old Block"" airing September 29, 1960, about dad, Steve, and son, Chip, both having to find a way to politely stave off the affections of a female.  2.)  ""The Girls Next Door"" airing February 1, 1962, has the Douglas men (except father) doting attentively on four stewardesses (flight attendants!?) who move in next door.  3.)  ""Monsters and Junk Like That"" airing November 5, 1965, illustrates the lengths this caring father will go to help his son in a school play.  4.)  ""If at First"" airing October 20, 1965, has dad unwittingly getting upset about a parking ticket with a meter maid who is actually Robbie's new girlfriend.

I highly recommend this series for the whole family.  I wish the entire series was offered on DVD boxed sets.",1121731200,22,1198,4.780487804878049
