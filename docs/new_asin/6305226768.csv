The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television! ... Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy. The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ~ William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films...a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of his films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys...just the way we like 'em.",1162166400,,4469,5.3366477272727275

7886964,3,6305226768,"A ruthless outlaw gang is bent on cattle stealing and murder.  The Hopalong Cassidy series is a cut above the typical B Western.  The Harry Sherman production values and the sturdy direction of Lesley Selander are a treat.  William Boyd's portrayal of Hopalong Cassidy is part of Western film history that carried over into the Baby Boomers' Saturday morning TV diet.  The characters are loosely based on the writings of Clarence E. Mulford.  Boyd's black-suited, silver-haired cowboy on a white horse is pure Hollywood fabrication.  Regardless, there is enough riding, shooting, and action to please fans.  Young actors George Reeves (of Superman fame) and Robert Mitchum play rivals for the local Pearl Pureheart.  One of our favorite bad guys, Victor Jory, is the villain.  There is some mild comic relief from Andy Clyde, and a mule named Molly.  As usual with Hopalong Cassidy flicks, the action builds to a climactic shootout with the outlaw gang.  Saddle up and ride pardner.
