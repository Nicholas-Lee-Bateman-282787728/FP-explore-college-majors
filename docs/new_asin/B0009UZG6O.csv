2323015,5,B0009UZG6O,"""Bataan"" is probably one of the best WWII-Infantry-Pacific-Theater movies that has been made -- if not the best.  Several of the most convincing actors of that era (perhaps any era) are there: Robert Taylor, Lloyd Nolan, Robert Walker, and Thomas Mitchell.

To me, the movies ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" represent the pinnacle of the ""WWII-Infantry-movie-genre"" so far. Of course they are set in the European Theater of WWII, and not the Pacific Theater of war.  I consider these movies to be so good because I prefer historical accuracy and realism when it comes to war movies.  If you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" you will probably appreciate ""Bataan,"" which was released in 1943 and was made with a lot less technology than is available today.  The inclusion of the movie ""Back To Bataan,"" makes a nice double-feature set.

2323017,4,B0009UZG6O,"At $10/US, you get two entertaining movies, a real bargain.

In Bataan, the mixed US force fought against very great odds and performed heroic deeds against a numerically superior force in trying to perform their job.

In Back to Bataan with John Wayne and Anthony Quinn, the struggle against a logistically superior enemy was fairly well documented during World War II and was depicted fairly well.  The Filipino people sacrificed much for their freedom and they made an effort to present that in this film.

Don't let the fact that the movies are in Black and White deter you.  Bataan/Back to Bataan are good movies!  My rating:  4 stars!",1180742400,,640,4.81651376146789

2323109,4,B0009UZG6O,"Bataan is a fantastic and rare film. It is not fantastic like Saving Private Ryan or the MacArthur being that it was made in 43 but few people had made films about the fall of the Philippines and it gives the viewer a good sense of how desperate things were. THE BATTLE SCENES ARE AMAZING AND AHEAD OF THEIR TIME.  Back To Bataan however,  is a generic John Wayne propaganda film which is very sappy and innacurate. The first five minutes are good but after that, it might as well have been an episode of CHIPS. For the price though,  do it",1436313600,,540,4.2745098039215685

2323194,3,B0009UZG6O,My copy of Bataan/Back to Bataan have a problem.  Bataan  about 2/3 through the movie starts freezing.  I have a dvd(r)/vcr and also a Blu Ray Player and Bataan started freezing on both.  It was nearly impossible to finish the movie.  You have to go to the next scene to get that movie to play.  Back to Bataan ran well.  This is a problem of maybe paying too little for a movie.,1371340800,3,379,4.180555555555555

2323200,5,B0009UZG6O,"I was born in Cavite City, Philippines. On a clear day I could see the island of Corregidor which is a part of Cavite Province and on the northwestern part of Manila Bay, Bataan. I have seen Bataan at AMC (American Movie Classics) several times but I want a DVD for my own collection. Back to Bataan was really an added excellent bonus to my collection. Both movies has shown how our American friends together with Filipino fighters, resisted the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. So much courage and sacrifice were shown by these two movies which is why our two countries are very much in close ties with each other. I must say that it will take awhile before this two masterpieces will be duplicated. Five star for both movies.

2323201,5,B0009UZG6O,"Both movies are worth the price but Bataan has all the elements of a true cinema classic.  Putting aside the attitude of the movie industry at large when promoting patriotism during these years...this film reaches that rare plateau of true cinematic art.  The cinematography is crisp and uses the black and white canvas to paint an ever encroaching somber inevitability to the soldiers situation. The set design is a marvel of studio filming. The effects when required are breathtaking.  The acting is as good as it gets, right down to Desi Arnaz in an early portrayal before his hook-up with Lucy. The uneasy alliance between Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan mirrors the situation they find themselves in.  Thomas Mitchell and George Murphy are pitch perfect.  The script is terse and world weary.  It's clear the five writers (that's right) knew where of they spoke.  The Directors (Edward Dmytryck and Tay Garnett) take their story and players and put them through their paces until you can feel the heat and the humidity in your bones.  This picture is an example of the studio system at it's apex.  Everything comes together in a way that gives you a clear picture of what it must have been like for disparate G.I. Joes slogging through the routine of inherent bravery and cowardice mixed together in a cocktail that gets the job done.  Truly a great American film.

And it gets better, included for the price of a single movie on markdown is the stirring follow-up classic starring The Duke himself, ably assisted by Anthony Quinn and others.  While it falls short of the artistic achievement of Bataan, it is no slouch in delivering the kind of action and bravery World War II required of our soldiers.  And basically that's what both movies are about - OUR SOLDIERS, who gave and are giving to this day, their lives to protect our way of life, however mangled that black and white line has become, it still boils down to the G.I. waging war and dying in the process.  We owe them a lot more than we admit.",1244160000,9,2010,4.689458689458689
2323202,4,B0009UZG6O,Both of these films are a little heavy handed on the patriotic themes but that is because they were both done during the war.
