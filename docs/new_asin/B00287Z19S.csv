3872017,5,B00287Z19S,"The CHARLIE AND LOLA #9: WHAT CAN I WEAR FOR HALLOWEEN? is a nearly two-hour DVD with 9 different episodes. There's actually only one episode that has a Halloween theme, but the others are fun to watch.

The show focuses on a British boy and his younger sister--named Charlie and Lola--and their friends. Each cartoon teaches kids about sharing and how to deal with disappointments by looking at problems in a different way.

Although the animation is relatively simple, the mixed media used to create the graphics is very clever and leads to interesting visuals.

The voice actors are wonderful as the characters ""Charlie"" and his younger sister ""Lola,"" and their friends ""Marv"" and ""Lotta,"" along with other kids either at school or in the neighborhood.

The DVD menus are interactive and you can choose either ""play-all"" or ""episode selection.""

Nice treat for kids, and adults who enjoy cartoons.",1255651200,5,900,5.0134228187919465
3872018,5,B00287Z19S,Wonderful show!  A true joy to watch (both for my 5 year old and myself).,1255046400,2,73,3.8666666666666667
3872019,5,B00287Z19S,"My son has been a fan of Charlie & Lola since he was old enough for TV.  The characters have a wonderful sibling relationship - they are kind, thoughtful and sympathetic - just the kind of behavior I want my children to imitate.  The British accents are just a bonus...very cute.

I've always appreciated it when other reviewers post the episode listings, so here they are:
1. What Can I Wear for Halloween?
2. Everything is Different and not the Same
3. I am Goody the Good
4. But We Always do it Like This
5. I am Going to Save a Panda
6. I Slightly Want to go Home
7. Do Not Ever Never Let Go
8. I Would Actually Like to Keep It
9. But I Don't Really Like This Present",1253232000,30,671,4.030075187969925
3872020,5,B00287Z19S,Great Series! My daughter loves it and wants them all!,1435622400,,54,4.5
3872021,5,B00287Z19S,"My 3 year-old loves the stories of Charlie and Lola. The programs are in short segments (11 minutes each), and they always feature the interplay between the older boy, Charlie, and his little sister, Lola. It is a nice spin on childrens' TV to see a show where the feelings of other children and the guidance of an older sibling are used as devices to demonstrate appropriate behavior rather than the dcommands of parents and adults.

This disk is simply presented with a case and one disc, but it contains a good number of stories, and they all played well in my DVD and Blu-Ray player.

I recommend both the show and this disc very highly.",1432080000,,641,4.517241379310345

3872026,4,B00287Z19S,Very cute show but if your looking for a halloween movie for kids I wouldn't suggest this. There is one half hour of a not that halloween-ish episode. The rest of the episodes are regular (not holiday) episodes. My daughter loves the show but I was disappointed there wasn't more of a halloween theme :(,1413244800,,303,4.527272727272727
3872027,5,B00287Z19S,This one is great so is the one about the haunted house.....not scary just funny.  Also Lola's fear of spiders....great for fall/Halloween,1409443200,,138,5.2727272727272725
