8118172,1,B000F6ZBQ2,"The reason I gave one star is because there is nothing lower.  All the America's Castles DVDs that have the purple playing surface I have trouble with.  None of them play on my best, (high priced) machine but will play on my lesser quality backup.  However, ""Return to Newport"" absolutely refused to play on either machine no matter what I tried to get around it.  This was very disappointing to me as I had waited for ages to get this particular show.  I have no trouble with the America's Castles, two disc, Grand Tour set or with Hearst Castle as both of those have the usual silver playing surface.  Beware of purple DVDs!",1152057600,5,626,4.495575221238938
