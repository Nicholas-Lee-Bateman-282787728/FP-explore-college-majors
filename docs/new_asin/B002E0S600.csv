3915105,3,B002E0S600,"This one is for lovers of c movies, low budget movies shot by people who have never made a movie before. BUt they did a pretty good job for what they had. The story is similiar to the b movie that came out a few years later ""the boogens' with a mine with a monster in it storyline only  that one is a solid b movie and this is not.
The dvd looks ok but they print needed some dirt cleaned from it, still it could have been a lost movie easily with such a llmited release. The stop motion work is good here and at that time this technique was fading away for good but audiences would have enjoyed it in 1980 as not to 'strange'. Like I said if  you are a horror fan who loves these older type of c movies then you'll like this one. If  you are a snob who complains about older effects then don't go here.  The acting is acceptable but not up to the levels of a b movie probably.  They did some work on this print it's not perfect , I always wish that even movies I don't like would have cleaned up every blemish. This is a pretty decent flick in that regard. This is cheesy c movie stuff but I like that stuff so it's ok for what it is.",1298160000,,1135,3.896103896103896

3915107,3,B002E0S600,"Thank you Code Red for making it possible for a little horror flick like this to be placed onto dvd!  It's time to get rid of that big clamshell vhs box once again.  Alot of folks compare this flick to 'The Boogens', another forgotten creature flick,  and I can kinda see why.  But this creature in 'The Strangeness' is creepier, in my opinion.  It's a simple story; it's about a group of people wanting to explore a cave that has been considered cursed, says the locals.  You see, miners have died in that cave and it's a mystery in what caused their deaths!  Indians for years have been saying the cave is inhabited by a ancient being and that no one should enter ""Golden Spike"", name of the cave.  Will these new explorers make it out alive!?  You'll just have to see for yourself!  The special effects are practical but you go into watching a horror flick like this just to enjoy how simple it is, and that you love creature flicks no matter how dated they are compared to todays standards.  Warning!...this flick is a little slow moving.",1259884800,7,1042,4.4603174603174605
3915108,3,B002E0S600,"A lot budget US horror movie made by novices and filmed on sets built in garages. There are weakenesses - the script is too wordy, for example, and some people might find their attention span wandering - but for an ultra low budget film it's atmospheric with a stop motion monster that is used sparingly in the same way the alien was used in alien. The setting looks good, and unlike a lot of low budget horrors, there's a genuine attempt to create characters the audience can sympathise.

Simple story: a bunch of people go down a deserted mine in order to survey it before a planned reopening. As they travel deeper into the mind, strange winds occur, and one by one the explorers are picked off by whatever is lurking in the tunnels... A HP Lovecraftian flesh eating monster.

An effective, well made, low budget horror - whilst it does dazzle like, say, The Evil Dead, with creative camerawork and directing, it is well worth watching just to see how well something can be done on a low budget. Far outclasses most of the low budget horrors from the period in that respect.",1252022400,,1077,4.546391752577319
3915109,4,B002E0S600,"Years ago, when I was watching the 2AM Late Show this movie came on and somehow gripped with a haunting interest. I was never more fascinated. While the characters are stereotyped (the company man looking for keep his gold, the young expedition scout, the old timer with the tales of a haunted mine and ""It lives"" warnings, the writer, and the girl, as well as a few other extra victims) the creature is real original. Looking like something from a Lovecraft tale, this tentacled stop motion monster was around when the Indians had the land before white men found the Golden Spike Mine and died by it's hands 100 years before. After all this time, our heroes decide to enter the mine on a company inspection and are greeted by the creature. The movie is a cross between ""Alien"" and ""The Boogens"", the latter being the closest and being released within a year or so. But this one is better. The victims run through old mine tunnels, find skeletons and bodies, living victims glued to the roofs of the mine chambers, assault each other, find remains of the miners who died in the mine, hear a strange ""hellwinds"" and find the dwelling of the beast and end it all with an old stack of gunpowder, blasting caps and flares. The filming is dark, sometimes a strain to see what is going on, and slow, but when the creature shows up (having been hidden or glimpsed in areas of the picture) it is interesting to see this stop motion marvel eat the company man and chase the last two survivors in it's lair.

While there have been several bootleg VHS and DVD versions of this horror film, the real Trans World oversized clamshell packaging was my most prized and collectable item. CODE RED has FINALLY done an official overdue DVD release and we can hope to be treated with as much bonus behind the scenes material as has survived from 1985. Based on the official website at thestrangeness.net from one of the actors/crew it looks like we have it. Take a peek. They have the miniature mine sets, the stop motion models and behind the scenes shooting, plus more.

At print, VHS copies were going anywhere from $35-70 dollars. That is how rare this gem has been over the years. It took me almost 10 years and an email to Fred Olen Ray, the famous B-movie Retromedia mogul, to kindly respond and finally give me the title so it could be located. I bought my VHS copies off of Amazon due to tape wear before the DVD-R transfer revolution. So now we have the official DVD. No horror fan of classic 80s obscure horror would go without seeing this marvel at least three times.",1248480000,10,2559,4.524838012958964
3915110,5,B002E0S600,"I really like this film and I'm thrilled to see it coming out on DVD. It's about some engineers investigating a cave being preyed on by this awesome tentacle monster. It's certainly some strangeness. The vibe of the film is pretty eerie even though it's a cheesy 80s horror film. The cave settings are always dark and the viewer, like the characters, can't see everything that's going on in the tiny passage ways. This would make a great double or triple feature with any of the other cave/mine-themed horror movies like The Boogens, The Descent, My Bloody Valentine, etc. The VHS picture quality on my personal copy is atrocious, so I can't wait to see a digital version of this film.",1247443200,5,685,4.669421487603306
3915111,3,B002E0S600,"A mixed romp through the early eighties horror genre.  A group of people decide to explore an old mine, ""Golden Spike"", each of them has a different interest. One wants to write a book about it, another is a photographer, there's also a geologist and finally, a couple of guys working for the person heading the expedition, their objective is to see if it's worth investing half a million dollars to re-open the mine. One by one they encounter the monster and to make matters worse all the possible exits appear to be blocked. ""Winds of hell"" mysteriously start blowing, fear sets in, the only lights are the ones from the helmets. The guy in charge snaps, thinking that the rest of the people want to rob his firm's gold, there's no place to hide.

The monster reminded me of Lovecraft's monsters, I'm a fan of this sort of clay monsters, the tentacles, how it moved, etc. Even though the movie takes place in a mine, it should have had better lighting, at times all you can see is the light on their helmets, which is the same as saying, you can't see nothing at all. The acting deserves mixed reviews, some actors were OK, others not so much.

Overall it's an average story that could have become a good movie if there was a bigger budget.",1247356800,,1242,4.462555066079295

8366668,3,B002E0S600,"A very, very, very boring tentacle monster movie.

I need to start by warning all you readers of how boring this film was. Very, very, very boringwith the first hour being nigh unforgivable. After 30 minutes, you see a tentacle for a few seconds; after 45 minutes, you momentarily see the monsters face; and after 60 minutes you see most of its body for a moment. And with all these sightings, there aren't even any off-screen kills worth mentioning! All the exposition feels needless, it takes its toll on our patience, and nothing that happens seems to serve any purpose. No funny characters, no good gore, no gratuitous nudity, no silly tropes. Why am I even here?

Now, yes, I know what you're thinking. Thats how most early 80s monster movies were. And youd be right. They were slow for an hour and then had 20-30 minutes of fun. This film follows that model, its just that those first 60 minutes were extra stale.

An industry-hired team of spelunking investigators survey an abandoned gold mine, get trapped, and are hunted by a slimy tentacle monstera vagina-mouthed tentacle Claymation monster, at that! And for this perversely designed creature with some fun effects, we finally get to actually see one (but just one) cool on-screen death scene as it swallows whole a greedy schmuck. Yes, that was fun. But definitely not worth the wait in my opinion.

This film seems to get a lot of positive commentary on social media. I cant help but to wonder if this films reputation survives by that one death scene alone or the monster itself. It really has no other redeeming aspects.

As such, I don't recommend this. It wasn't very entertaining.",1523059200,,1649,4.751748251748252
8366669,5,B002E0S600,"""The strangeness"" was one of the better horror films that crawled out in 1985 (along the lines of Larry Cohen's also great ""The Stuff""). The monster is a pretty interesting looking beastie, and the claymation used to bring it to life is excellent. Some of the actors are bad but it's a very amusing horror film otherwise that when compared to most shoe-string budget horror film succeeds quite well. Recommended! Definitely check this one off your list",1523059200,,452,4.883116883116883
8366670,4,B002E0S600,"It's a long dark slog through a paper mache cave before you catch a brief glimpse of the tentacled Lovecraftian monster in The Strangeness (1985).

Is it worth the wait? The answer will depend on your level of patience, attention span, and love of vintage micro-budget ($25,000 according to IMDb) horror movies.

Yes, this thing has more padding than a pillow top mattress covered in bubble wrap - BUT - the good cinematography makes it look like it cost much more than it did, and the synth soundtrack is great. The acting is also much better than you'd expect in a micro-budgeted film.

The stop-motion monster's design is similar to John Carpenter's The Thing (but with a head that'd make Sigmund Freud blush). It's weird, clunky stop-motion movements add to it's crude charm. It would've been more effective if there'd been enough money to build a life size version for close-ups. According to IMDb, the monster was nicknamed ""Binky"" by the crew.

There's some genuinely tense moments near the end, with the small shadowy sets adding to a sense of claustrophobic dread.

The Strangeness is an interesting obscure little horror movie from the 1980s and if you're a fan of interesting obscure little horror movies from the 1980s, you'll find plenty to love here.

Melanie Anne Phillips directed the film under the pseudonym David Michael Hillman.",1521849600,3,1348,4.942477876106195
8366671,3,B002E0S600,Wasn't bad. Your typical 80's horror! Lol!,1521676800,,42,5.142857142857143
8366672,3,B002E0S600,"The premise reminds me of the (much better)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boogens/dp/B0081XOKH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boogens</a>. Both films involve some young people opening up a closed mine. A mine that had been shut long ago due to strange deaths and rumors of something evil. (1981's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Bloody-Valentine/dp/B0017CW5TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Bloody Valentine</a>&nbsp;also involved a mine, but that was a slasher film, whereas THE STRANGENESS and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boogens/dp/B0081XOKH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boogens</a>&nbsp;have monsters.)

THE STRANGNESS takes a while getting off. It opens with a dreadful day-for-night scene. Dreadful in that the image is very dark and murky. A young couple have been hired by someone to blow up this gold mine's entrance, presumably so the monster can't get out. It's a ridiculous premise. Why would anyone hire these two young incompetents? The woman only wants to tease the guy and have sex with him. And SHE was hired to blow up a mine?

After they fail (naturally, since it's only the start of the film), another group of young people go up to the gold mine, with two crusty middle-aged guys. They're supposed to explore, and report back on the mine's viability. Is there enough gold to justify re-opening it?

The characters are very overdrawn and poorly sketched, even for a horror film. Half of them are so nondescript, I can't tell them apart. No personalities at all. Just there to wander about the mine until the monster kills them. The rest only have a few character traits to set them apart. The geeky writer wears glasses, and spouts ridiculous nonsense into his tape recorder. His blond wife is pretty. What more is there to say about her? There's also a middle-aged Brit who spouts bad jokes. And some other people.

It takes a long while before any of them get killed. Little to see in much of this film, just folks wandering about mine shafts.

The monster is a tentacled, Lovecraftian thing. We don't see it often. I assume that's because it's a stop-motion, claymation monster, and stop-motion animation takes a lot of time. Perhaps it would have been easier if they used a rubber-suit monster? Still, the claymation is nicely done, though obviously not a real monster. Especially unreal-looking is when it grabs a miner and eats him.

The miners do stupid things, as is typical of horror characters. They're trapped after a cave-in. So they keep lighting flares, despite having plenty of electric lamps and flashlights. I wondered -- Isn't there a limited supply of oxygen down there? And won't those flares eat up that precious oxygen?

The acting is not great, but okay. The writing is no better. This is a pretty ""bad"" film, but enjoyable nonetheless if you're in the right mood. Hardcore horror fans should understand what I mean.

Shot in Newport Beach. I'm guessing that's the Newport Beach in California. (Yes, the gold mine's entrance is right on the beach -- does that make any sense?)",1428883200,,3168,5.5309917355371905
8366673,4,B002E0S600,"The Strangeness is a surprisingly good horror movie from the early eighties, one I only knew existed by searching Amazon for old monster movies.  The characters are searching an old mine to see if it could be productive again, a plot very similar to Boogens (another monster movie from roughly the same time).  The acting is pretty good, and to the best of my knowledge this is the only movie any of these actors appear in.  The set work for the mine and caves are good, too.  The monster is done with stop motion animation and it makes a late appearance in the movie, understandable given how time consuming and expensive stop motion is.  The extras go into some detail on how little cash they had for making the film, and as another commenters said it would have benefited from more funding.  But I feel they did well with what they had.",1398038400,,839,4.4868421052631575

If you like this kind of old-fashioned film this one is for you. If you want a huge
amount of CGIs them you'll be disappointed. Things like the highly touted remake of
Day the Earth Stood Still stink when compared to the original as almost all of them
do.

In fact, the best reason to watch this is for when the creature is finally revealed
in its Harryhausen glory: stop-motion. The thing has a fine time with the film's main grouch also. Scenes like this make you realize just how good the old style of animation was.
