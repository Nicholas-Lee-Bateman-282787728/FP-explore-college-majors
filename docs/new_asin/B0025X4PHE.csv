8351447,4,B0025X4PHE,"Another show borrowing from the Dragnet format. This show took its case files from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, the same way Dragnet did with the LAPD. Shot in a similar style to the many other 50's cop shows. Fairly low budget stuff, but pretty entertaining if you're into the genre. As I mentioned it has a similar feel to Dragnet, and other shows like Highway Patrol, M-Squad, etc... There are four episodes on the disc, they appear to be from various sources, but all are very watchable, and the sound quality is decent for the time period. There is no star of the show, each episode features a different set of players. Which I think made this show kinda unique. The episodes deal with everything from women in the county jail, to a sniper who guns down women, an overbearing rookie sheriff, and forgery. The acting is not stellar, but the story lines are actually pretty interesting. It does have a certain edge to it. But still very 50's-ish and wholesome. I don't know much about the history of the show, but I hope more episodes appear sometime soon. If you're a fan of 50's Dragnet, M-Squad, Highway Patrol, Sky King, State trooper, etc.. You will probably enjoy this show.",1366675200,2,1192,4.654028436018957
