7944398,4,B00005LQ5F,"If you love ""I Love Lucy"" or if you just love Lucille Ball, you will like all her shows including The Lucy Show.  The Lucy Show was Lucy's second act after she ended the ""I Love Lucy"" show and later divorced Desi Arnaz (supposedly she divorced him after he was caught cheating with other women on many occasions).  Just like the ""I Love Lucy"" show (1950s), ""The Lucy Show"" (1960s) had six seasons just like her third show ""Here's Lucy (1970s),"" which also ended after six seasons.

In this Vol. 2 of The Lucy Show, I watched it through Amazon Prime (not the early VHS version).  The VHS reviews don't quite seem to match what I streamed through Amazon Prime.  Yes, the episodes were not remastered, so are not of the best quality, but they are the quality of their times in the 1960s.  Each episode is a little more than 24 minutes, so each volume of 2 hours and 6 minutes has five episodes.  Too bad, these volumes do not have all the episodes of each season.  It's mix and match in episodes.  In this volume: 1st episode, Lucy tries on a $6,000 diamond ring and gets it stuck on her finger; 2nd episode, Lucy is drafted accidentally into the military and has to wait for the proper authority to correct the issue; 3rd episode, Lucy and her best friend Vivian Vance (from the original ""I Love Lucy"" show) infiltrates themselves as chic wild girls to find out what happened to a friend's son; 4th episode, Lucy and Mr. Mooney visit a small town to build a freeway through Main Street; and 5th episode, Lucy is mistaken for a grand larceny that took place when she went shopping with her friend, Mary Jane.  In all episodes, Lucy is either misunderstood or does something foolish while working as a secretary for Mr. Theodore Moony (played by Gale Gordon), a banker.",1516320000,,1765,4.4875

7944401,4,B00005LQ5F,"Alpha, the most venerable of all the budget-priced DVD companies, recycles the same old episodes of THE LUCY SHOW that have fallen into public domain limbo. Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased these eps over and over again, but the price is right for the casual viewers too.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success. THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York. The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Little Old Lady Lucy"" - Lucy masquerades as an elderly millionairess in order to attract a new customer for the bank.

""Lucy and the Monkey"" - Overworked Lucy believes an escaped monkey, let loose in Mooney's office, is actually Mr. Mooney himself!

""Lucy and the Ring-a-Ding-Ding"" - Whilst admiring a ring that Mooney has purchased for his wife, Lucy tries it on her finger where it promptly becomes stuck.

""Viv Visits Lucy"" - Lucy and Viv go undercover as hippies on the Sunset Strip when they learn that one of their friends' sons has supposedly ""gone native"".

""Lucy and John Wayne"" - Lucy disrupts production of John Wayne's latest film when she delivers bank papers to the set.",1283126400,,1469,4.75984251968504

7944403,4,B00005LQ5F,"This 2-disc set from Madacy Entertainment comprises 10 great episodes from THE LUCY SHOW.  This sitcom told the story of widows Lucy Carmichael (Lucille Ball) and Viv Bagley (Vivian Vance) raising their children together in upstate New York.  Later on, the series changed when Lucy traveled to California to be the secretary to grumpy banker Mr Mooney (Gale Gordon).  This set features eps from both phases of the series.

""Lucy the Starmaker"" - Lucy notices Mr Cheever's nephew (Frankie Avalon) has a great singing voice and decides to help launch his entertainment career.

""Lucy Meets Robert Goulet"" - When a truck-driver gets turned down for a loan, Lucy notices he resembles Robert Goulet and enters him in a look-alike contest.  This episode also features a young Lucie Arnaz playing one of Lucy's secretary friends.

""Lucy Gets a Roommate"" - Lucy receives more than she bargained for with her latest flatmate, eccentric librarian Carol Bradford (guest star Carol Burnett).

""Lucy and Carol in Palm Springs"" - Lucy feigns illness and joins Carol's band for a golfing tournament engagement, unaware that Mr Mooney is one of the entrants.

""Lucy's Barbershop Quartet"" - Lucy wants to join Viv's barbershop group, but she doesn't make much of an impression with her whisper-soft rendition of `Down By the Old Mill Stream'.  Perhaps an eccentric voice coach (guest star Hans Conreid) can help?

""Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower"" - Trying to save money, Lucy and Viv attempt to install a shower in the boys' bedroom.

""Lucy's Substitute Secretary"" - Lucy calls off her Lake Arrowhead vacation when she discovers her efficient replacement (guest star Ruta Lee).

""Lucy and the French Movie Star"" - Lucy attempts to stave off the advances of the bank's newest celebrity client (guest star Jacques Bergerac).

""Main Street USA"" - Lucy joins forces with a local town who are fighting against developers wanting to put a freeway through beloved Main Street.

""Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard"" - Lucy mistakes the bank's newest celebrity client for a bank robber.

Pretty good box set for the money.  Extras include a trivia quiz and some classic commercials.",1123632000,4,2146,5.0339943342776206
7944404,3,B00005LQ5F,"The Lucy show DVD set was cheap. There were no official air dates of each episode, which would be good information for fans, and the episodes were not restored much, and, all of the episodes are out of order...like the first 4 are in color, and then theres one from the first 3 seasons, in black and white...I'd wait for a better edition DVD package unless you're a diehard fan, but, on the record, they picked some fairly good episodes for this 10 episode DVD 2 pack! The shower episode, Lucy takes vacation and new roommate episodes were great!",1088812800,5,546,4.525252525252525
