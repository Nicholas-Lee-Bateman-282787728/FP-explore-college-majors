8298817,5,B001ELLDA0,"I really enjoyed this film. There was some history, a tie in with Bruce Brown and the endless summer films, and some contemporary footage of Mickey Munoz surfing, and ""killing it"". My only complaints were that this dvd is edited and still in it's TV format. There is no menu and the film starts when you pop in the disc. Aside from that it is a story about one of Mickey Dora's great ideas he had in his life that was never fully realized whilst he was alive. It is a tribute I hope he would appreciate. It was well made, and directed by another Brown hence the Endless Summer nods, but nonetheless well made, shot beautifully and short, to the point and entertaining. If you like classic surfing, longboards, and can appreciate balsa and the non conformist ideology of the complicated Mickey Dora buy this and enjoy it for what it is a short, but great surf film that is not selling anything, not compelling me to go buy the newest greatest whatever, it's a film about a mindset and the search not for surf, not for greatness or fame, but doing things on your own on your terms and not serving up manufactured stoke.",1332633600,3,1117,4.427184466019417
