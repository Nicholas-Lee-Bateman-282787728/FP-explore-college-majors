The good thing is, I have already read a number of Mark Kistler's books and done the exercises. You don't have to be a kid to read these books and watch the DVD. It sure helps to be a kid at heart though.",1417996800,,308,4.15
8423743,1,B00006LSAI,"I wish I could return this! The video is very low quality and the content is poor. I purchased to use it in my classroom, but my students would be soooooo board with this. I was expecting lessons in 3D. These are little lessons (4), showing a little depth with wavy lines and some shadowing. I have seen better videos than this one. I just wish I had not waisted almost $30 on something that will get no use.",1404345600,,408,4.177215189873418
8423744,5,B00006LSAI,my 10 yr old grandson really enjoyed this way of learning to draw.  I would recommend this to anyone. I might buy one for myself!,1390262400,,129,4.16
8423745,5,B00006LSAI,"If you are looking for a place to start learning to draw, and the books you have seen before only make it harder, your search is over. This video and the others make it all easy for you. Mark used to have different shows on PBS, ""Imagination Station"", and ""Draw Squad"", both were huge hits with kids. Mark makes it easy for anyone at any age to get basic drawing skills, the building blocks you need to get started. He teaches the skills that are usually complex, without the stress or making it go over your head. His way of teaching is simply the easiest method a person can have to start drawing. And if the shows are good, his books hold their own as well. Mark makes drawing so fun kids beg to use the video again and again. He does not start by intimidating you with the completed project, in fact you don't always know what you are drawing until you are done. He takes you one line, circle, or square at a time and before you know it you have a fun completed drawing. Next he shows you how to make it more realistic and encourages you to add features of your own. I also reccommend you try the books from Ed Emberly such as ""The Big Green Drawing Book"", or check my lists on Amazon for tools for kids that want to learn to draw, or be a cartoonist or animator.",1121817600,,1267,4.1755102040816325
8423746,5,B00006LSAI,"If there are two things I got for x-mas, that changed my life they are The Butterfly (jay singh) and this video tape. Mark has so much positive energy that he inspires all who  watch his wonderful tape to pick up a pencil and draw. People like Mark are real leaders and when I heard The Butterfly was going to be illustrated I wished he would do it. He's just a really great animator and teacher. If you're serious about drawing, you can't miss this tape.",1041465600,,455,4.290697674418604
