His favourite words are their favourite things - Ball! Hat! Bag!. This video is  one of their best, avoid Dance with... as its pretty dull.",930700800,14,283,4.4423076923076925

  Crazed-eyed baby  with a twisted evil eye  laughs  maniacally within a simulated sunshine.
I heard somewhere that it is  healthy to expose the belly button area to the sun for at least 15 minutes  a day. It charges your chakra and gives a jolt to your day. Perhaps this  was the idea behind the mastermind of this twisted baby in the sky. She/he  glows like a god and watches the various colored, alien-like, human-sized  creatures walk through the English countryside.
Television screens grace  their tummies, powered, I suppose, by this crazed-eyed sunshine baby.  Throughout the show their tummies link you to avant garde films of British  Kindergarteners going about their day.
It's like MTV's Real World -  London, 1995, but made for kids and by more intelligent people. This 'film  noir' of children's programs mirrors the inside of our brains moreso than  MTV or much of the American mainstream crap on TV. Pity, we must get up at  7 a.m. Seattle time to catch this brilliant public television show.  Thankfully you can buy videos on-line.
My therapist sister claims this  show causes children to digress. Apparently it is targeted toward infants,  but they are too young to understand. Older kids who watch it already know  how to talk nonsense and count to 4, so it only turns their brain to jello.  fair enough; I agree that this show may be suited more for wayward adults  and grandfathers on acid. But who are such Highbrow shows such as  ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""That 70's Show"" geared  toward? These shows teach tomorrow's world leaders how to seduce,  manipulate, and condemn. Teletubbies may not teach our youth management  skills, but they do teach high values.
Twinkie Winkie gathers his  friends' toys in his bag as he takes a walk. It was amazing that the  scooter, rubber ball, and a hat all fit! Further along the trail he  complains that the bag is too heavy. The narrator asks, ""Twinkie  Winkie, do you know why the bag is heavy?""
After a shrug and a sigh,  it is realized that he stole his friends' toys, and he takes them out of  the bag.  This is one fine example of many where the writers of this  cutting-edge show weave in positive cultural values. I am pleased that the  producers of this psychedelic show managed to get a time slot on mainstream  television networks.
""And there was tubbie toast all over Twinkie  Winkie."" Purple, yellow, orange and blue teletubbies coyly munch on a  pile of toast after the toaster malfunctioned and threw out countless  pieces of toast. Telebubbie munchies! They much like rabbits, and then go  outside and munch with rabbits.
Much of the negative reaction to this  show may well have to do with it's diametric opposition to monotheism.  While this group of colored tripped out adults do their day, they  communicate with the flowers, trees, and animals all the same. Everything  is equal; their world is not stratified. Property is communal, and the  lifestyle is rather Zen.
This pantheistic attitude to the plants and  animals was common among the native people who originally lived on our  land.  Pantheists and Taoists alike can respect this children's program,  which has been out in the UK for a few years and is newly released in the  US.",912816000,3,3297,4.763765541740675

We often go on long car trips, and my daughter, who is 18 months, absolutely LOVES her teletubbies dvds.  She watches them in the car and my husband and I have a pleasant ride with no baby screaming in the backseat.

Not only do  these dvds keep her entertained, they have helped her with her first words as well.  At 11 months, her first word was ""Uh Oh"", and we know where she got it from.  :)

If you find yourself sitting at the computer with your 2-year old on your lap clicking through the Teletubbies website (which is very well done, I might add) then you'll find a number of familiar themes in this video.

As far as the ""controversy"" of the Teletubbies, whipped up by some conservative folks out there- I think they are off base and need a life.  The Teletubbies serve up giggles galore for my kid.  And, believe it or not, I'm not fearing for my son's future preferences!

The whole plot of 4 characters playin together in teletubbie land seemed perfect as the grounds on which i was pointing my ideas. The first time i watched this DVD i was amazed by the complicity yet deep simplicity of the four starring rolls and let me tell you i wass joining in the shouts of ""again again"" when the credits started to roll.

Watch and enjoy this but what ever you do don't dive in to the deep dark world of teletubbies and explore the relms of thhe unknowen or you may never be able to enjoy the teletubbies again!!!!!",1120953600,2,747,4.413043478260869

965930,5,6305080062,My son (21 months) has several Teletubby videos but this one is his favorite by far. he loves the segment with the little dog and the kids at the beach. I can have this video playing in one room and he can be in another and when he hears that little dog he will come running. it is like he is mesermized with the teletubbies. I have several family and friends who think I shouldn't let him watch them but my husband and I have no problems with the teletubbies. they are sweet and loving and my son gives more hugs since watching them. I will continue to buy teletubby tapes until he out grows them. I would recomend this and any of the other videos to anyone!!!,1072915200,9,661,4.171875
965931,5,6305080062,"I realize there has been some controversy with the Teletubbies.
I realize that there are some statements by the leading experts that kids under two should not watch tv. But all that aside, the Teletubbies are the videos I turn to when I want a video for my children to watch. My four year old loved them and has recently outgrown them and doesn't find them as fascinating as he did. However, my two year old still loves them. They are gentle, sweet, and fun. They dance and jump and play and hug. The videos are devided into short clips that around 10-15 minutes long and this makes it very easy to moniter how much tv they are watching. You can let them watch one or two little segments and turn it off without interrupting something right in the middle of the show.
If you like to control what your child watches and you have young children, this is a great video to get. Any of the Teletubbie videos are great.

965932,5,6305080062,"If you are looking for wholesome, stimulating and educational viewing material for kids under 5, look no further.  They are a bit trippy from an adult's perspective, and I'm sure controlled substances were in use by the folks who thought this up and designed the program, but they are PERFECT for the under-5 set.  My son is 4 and still enjoys watching this.  Both my son and daughter (22 mos) particularly loved the animal parade segment as well as the live footage of kids at kindergarten and chasing Jesso the dog on the beach.  In fact, there have been many times when the only way I could calm my son down as a toddler was to sing the animal parade song with him.  My kids enjoy making their own parade with their stuffed animals as well.
  This video won't overwhelm your kids with huge quantities of data on letters, numbers, shapes etc., but it does provide plenty of quality material to use educationally in watching with your kids in a low-key way - I've found it a decent tool for fostering vocabulary development by naming the animals etc., narrative understanding talking about actions and storyline that are occurring on screen, naming colors, counting items, etc.  And hey, it's stimulating to eyes and ears and just plain fun!  the tunes are catchy if goofy.  Whoever created these Teletubbies shows and videos really knows what young kids enjoy.  And to them, I say, THANK YOU!",1043280000,4,1394,4.695473251028806
