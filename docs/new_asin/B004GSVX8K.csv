4373955,5,B004GSVX8K,"Young Writer/Director Mia Hansen-Lve has created a story loosely based on a real situation that manages to examine the central aspect of family love: 'the defeat of death, the victory of life'. Gr&eacute;goire Canvel (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing) is a producer in the film industry, an auteur who is devoted to quality films. As a producer he has several films in varying stages of production (including one in Sweden directed by a difficult genius who has little respect for cost containment) and the financial aspects of his Moon Films is in rocky terrain, despite being surrounded by a staff devoted to his vision and going without pay because of their commitment. At the same time Gr&eacute;goire is a devoted husband to his wise wife Sylvia (Chiara Caselli) and to his three daughters - the oldest being the sensitive Cl&eacute;mence (a stunning portrayal by young Alice de Lencquesaing), Valentine (Alice Gautier) and Billie (Manelle Driss) - taking country walks with them and being wholly involved with their family activities, despite the fact that he is constantly on the cellphone managing the tragedies that abound at work. It is apparent that everyone who comes into contact with Gr&eacute;goire feels the special gifts he has - except for the lawyer and creditors he tries to avoid. The financial sinkhole opens and Gr&eacute;goire, in despair, commits suicide. The story actually begins here, as the point of the film is how each of the people who came under Gr&eacute;goire's influence - co-workers, wife and children, and friends - responds to the loss of this man. There is not the usual breast-beating grieving, but rather a quiet study of how each of these people is affected by and reacts to the passing of a solitary genius by suicide. The film is definitely one that is life affirming rather than an extended eulogy!

The entire cast is excellent, with special kudos to the children as well as to Eric Elmosnino who plays a rock bound friend to the family and the director's brother Igor Hansen-Lve whose small part as a hopeful writer is richly detailed. This may be too early a time to judge the talent of Mia Hansen-Lve, but if she is able to maintain the quality she achieves in THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN, she has an exciting future in cinema. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, June 10",1280707200,3,2307,4.900255754475704

8428966,5,B004GSVX8K,I'm a sucker for family dramas and this is just a truly one-of-a-kind film.  The characters are all wonderfully developed and the family dynamics are very moving and authentic.  It has a naturalist feel to the film without being too slow and drawn out.,1454371200,,252,4.704545454545454

8428969,3,B004GSVX8K,"I am all for emotional films with major depth, films that reach out and grab you, films that keep you interested whether it is the characters, their plight, journey, demise, etc.

However, this film did not do it.  First, this is a very lengthy movie, nearly two hours,  too long, slow paced.  This film did not ""grab"" me as I believed it could have.  I like to ""feel"" the emotions, and did not.

Gr&eacute;goire Cancel is a French film movie producer, whose financial burden of debt is slowly increasing to the culmination of assets frozen Moon Films.  He is always on the phone, including while driving and even loses his license to drive.  But, he has a love for his family and manages to spend some quality time with them.

The second part of the movie cover the wife and three daughters  coping with a saddened tragedy and the attempt to unravel a financial burden.

This story is based upon a real life story of  a real-life producer Humbert Balsan, whose own business went down.  Again, too slow paced, too long, not enough substance, no depth nor feeling.

When the going gets tough, the tough are gone.  Rizzo",1379808000,,1118,4.575757575757576
8428970,4,B004GSVX8K,"It's better not to know too much about this film before watching it.  Like others have said, it's about a French movie producer who has bitten off more than he can chew.  Small business people will sympathize with the feeling of not having the employees, outside contractors, or credit to handle all their obligations.  He pretends to be optimistic in front of the family but it gradually becomes clear the business is bankrupt.",1364515200,,428,4.835616438356165
8428971,4,B004GSVX8K,"I was recently browsing the foreign film section at my local library and stumbled upon this movie. I must say I didn't know much about the movie but I took a chance and picked it up. Boy, am I glad I did!

""The Father of My Children"" (2009 release from France; 115 min.) brings the story of Gregoire, a successful movie producer, and his family (wife and 3 daughters). In the first half of the movie, we see a lot of Gregoire at his job, trying to keep his ""Moon Films"" producing company afloat, while trying to keep things right with his family and spending time with them at their country house outside of Paris. But money gets tighter than ever at Moon Films. Half-way into the movie, without wanting to give too much away from the plot, a tragic event occurs.

You'll need to see for yourself how it all plays out, but I promise you that you won't be disappointed. The overall feel of the movie is a huge credit to writer-director Mia Hansen-Lve. But special mention should go to Michal Abiteboul as Gregoire, and to Alice de Lencquesaing as his teenage daughter Clementice, who frankly floored me with her performance. This movie won one of the prizes at the 2009 Cannes film festival, and it's easy to see why. Mind you, this is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. But if you are in the mood for a good foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Father of My Children"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1339027200,4,1415,4.45945945945946

8428973,2,B004GSVX8K,"Produced and marketed as a ""tragedy"", this subtitled film has essentially two parts--neither of which is cinematically noteworthy. The first portion, for example, deals with the protagonist's family and work life--the mounting financial stressors predominate.  The second segment deals with the family's attempts to cope with a major loss. The characters, children and physical landscape are certainly photogenic, but as a dramatic portrait there's really no intensity or compelling urgency for one to rush out and purchase this film.",1314057600,,534,5.7594936708860756
8428974,5,B004GSVX8K,"Mia Hansen-Love has been an actress but preferred to direct film. So to the man this film is about,the legendary Humbert Balsan,had acted in Bresson and had small roles in other films,prior to turning to film producing. He had famously produced Lars von Trier and Clair Denis,directors for the festival circuit,unprofitable in the mainsteam. He was responsible for the production of 70 films before his death in 2005. He had also nurtured hopes of producing this director's first film. This film is a homage to him,the father of many film children,illegitimate offspring of his love. Father of my children is a film of two halves,also it's a film about art and life. Gregoire Canvel (de Lencquesaing) is happily married with 3 beautiful daughters and a loving wife(Caselli).He lives however totally for his work as a film producer. Yet he's constantly on the phone,wheeling and dealing,running in front of a black cloud of spiralling debt-too many projects,too many risks,too many egos sucking him dry,especially the Swedish film auteur,Stig. He juggles this with time with his family in the country at weekends or on holiday in Ravelli. Louis-Do's own daughter(Alice) acts as his daughter in the film. Hansen-Love's own brother acts as a budding young director in this too. Gregoire ploughs on at all costs using up his currency of charm until he is finally forced to confront the reality of the situation. There is a crisis which I won't reveal and the film's 2nd half concentrates on the wife and 3 daughters. This film is about the ghosts of cinema,the after-life of what people leave behind. The acting and film direction is beautifully observed and naturalistic, with moments of beautiful stillness and relaxation and a fluidity of interaction between people,an award-winning drama which opens like a plant unfolding, boding well for Hansen-Love's future film career. There is an extra of her being interviewed which gives a useful insight in what she tries to achieve with actors.",1281312000,,1987,5.116923076923077
