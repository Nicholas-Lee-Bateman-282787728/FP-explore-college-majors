Nice to see Lau Ching Won in a slightly more romantic light that his world weary cop roles or his dangerous fireman turns.  I really loved this one.  The actress was so refreshing!",1371340800,,286,4.2592592592592595
7879075,1,6304852819,"This is a Hong Kong classic but this version is a crappy DVD-R release - how do I know? I know because I made the mistake of buying it!

The picture is terrible - they didn't even copy from a DVD by the looks of it. Even a copy of the HK DVD release that had ""hard"" subs would have been better than this travesty :(

Here on Amazon there is listed a late December 2007 release of this from the same company (Tai Seng) that MIGHT be a legit proper version with both Cantonese & Mandarin soundtracks - I'll be checking with them to find out!

AVOID THIS EDITION LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!",1193097600,,580,4.115044247787611
7879076,5,6304852819,"I rented this movie on a whim just to check it out and im definately glad I did. I have no idea why people seem to think this movie is for 'teenage girls' because Im not a teenage girl and I really liked this. No, Im not usually into romance movies...they usually are so sappy im looking for the remote within the first 15 minutes. This was completely different, The acting and the story is so captivating, especially to me, as I could relate to the main character, being that im a musician as well. Thats what grabbed me from the beginning, the sheer reality of it, unlike the 'we're rich, snobby people in love but oh what a wacky love it is!' garbage, drivel most American romance movies are. Sure the plot had a few weak moments, but what movie doesnt? What really made this movie stand out to me was the ending..stark and real, not the typical 'everything is great!' hollywood nonsense. I won't give away too much, but the change was definately refreshing. do yourself a favor and rent or buy it.",1078272000,7,1001,4.416216216216216
7879077,4,6304852819,"It's a love story with a little melodrama and a tragedy.  And like most love stories, the plot is fairly transparent.  However, what differentiates this movie from the run-of-the-mill romances are the strong performances of  the leads, a well written script and lovely supporting characters.  The  film isn't merely about love, it's about life and living life in a positive  way.  It doesn't really dwell too much on melodrama or tragedy, instead  prefering to concentrate on hope and living life.
Loosely, the plot is  about a angry music composer, Kit, who is unable to make it in the  commercial world because of his ""principles.""  He breaks up with  his superstar girlfriend and moves to a poorer part of town where he meets  Min, her family and members of the Chinese opera troupe that Min is a part  of.  Kit rediscovers his love for his craft not only from his interaction  with the positive-thinking-live-live-to-the-fullest Min but also from the  members of the opera troupe.  Their closeness and their passion for a dying  craft helps Kit in his search for meaning.
I loved it that director Derek  Yee let many of the street perfoming scences run.  He just lets them sing.  Music plays an integral part in this film.  One of the loveliest scenes is  the one where Kit jams with the Uncle and a Filipino band in Min's  house.
I recommend this film and if you like it, I suggest watching the  HK ""Lost and Found.""  Another tale of hope in the face of tragedy  with a lot less melodrama than most.",959904000,6,1504,4.659003831417625
7879078,5,6304852819,It appears as if the C'est la Vie (HK film) reviews are linked to some insipid europop act. So for the benefit of those looking for a film review I will say this: Imagine a room full of grown men (and a few women) crying  because of a film. That is what Anita Yuen did to us. Simply put it is a  tear-jerker kind of film but done in a humanistic unglossy kind of way only  Hong Kong could pull off. I guess that is the benefits of still being a  fledgling industry is that you can get away with sentimental and nobudget  films without looking cheap; it just looks honest instead. suffice to say I  liked it and still think Anita Yuen is one of the best things since swiss  cheese.,948153600,10,680,4.106060606060606
