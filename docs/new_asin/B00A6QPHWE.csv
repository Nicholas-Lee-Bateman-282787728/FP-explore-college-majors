8547049,5,B00A6QPHWE,"This is the most poignant, hilarious and insightful look at life inside the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Sasson Gabai is the Arabic Mr. Bean.  There are sequences in this movie that are simply unforgettable - how does one make a suicide bombing funny?  You'll have to watch.",1424304000,,276,5.088888888888889
8547050,5,B00A6QPHWE,"I saw this film in 2011 when I was living in France.  It was screamingly funny. The surreal ending, for me, was somehow deeply sorrowful without deviating from the comic tone of the film. It raised the question in my mind as to whether any resolution between Israel and Gaza in the real world will ever be possible.  Maybe only when pigs have wings.",1413936000,,349,4.4375
8547051,5,B00A6QPHWE,"This starts off with the man fishing and somehow manages to catch a pig in his net.  He runs from the pig on his small fishing boat and finally manages to close the pig in the cabin area.  He then goes to town to try to sell a pig.  But I think it's a jewish town in the Gaza strip and they won't have anything to do with a pig.  There's a military presence in his town and the people seem to dislike the military, but the man manages not to sell the pig but to make a deal with a lady at the military camp for impregnating the female pigs. After that the story get crazy. The last 20 minutes of this film the man is running around, the pig is running around, the townspeople, the guys wife, and the military are all running around and is absolutely hilarious.  I loved it and highly recommend it to everyone.

The original film I believe is in Arabic.  The film I watched was in arabic with french subtitles or spoken french and no subtitles.  Since this copy is being sold in the U.S. but has a french title I'm not sure what language or subtitles it has. The film details do not mention what language it is in.

Loved the film.  As you can see on the dvd cover he's trying to hide the fact that it's a pig.  It's one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time.",1390780800,3,1267,4.028
