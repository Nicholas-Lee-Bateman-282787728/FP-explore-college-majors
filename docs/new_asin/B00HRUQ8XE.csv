8635026,4,B00HRUQ8XE,"I often stay away from DVD compilation releases, as they tend to collect lackluster genre movies and are often of lesser quality than singular versions.  There are exceptions, however, and Shout! Factory's Martial Arts Movie Marathon just squeaks by as one of them.  While none of these films will blow away fans of old school kung fu, these are solid, with better-than-average fights for the mid-'70s.  This 2 DVD set contains 4 films from the famed Golden Harvest studio.  All are remastered (by Fortune Star) & widescreen (2.35:1), with original Mandarin language OR English dubs.  3 of the 4 movies feature early choreography and appearances by the magnificent Sammo Hung.  Carter Wong stars in 2 of them and has a particularly interesting cameo in a 3rd.

THE SKYHAWK

The great Kwan Tak Hing (""Dreadnaught"") once again plays legendary boxer & physician Wong Fei Hung (dude played him in over 70 films!).  He is traveling with his student Fei Fei (Sammo Hung) when they witness a man (Carter Wong) getting the stuffing kicked out of him by the always-awesome Whang In-Shik (Jackie Chan's ""Young Master""), who works for the evil Mr Ku (Chiu Hung, ""One Armed Swordsman""), who wants to forcibly unionize the town's workers.  Our heroes nurse Carter back to health and train him to help take out the trash.

Pretty decent little film.  The fights, for the most part, are pretty good.  White Crane master Kwan Tak Hing actually looks great in his fights (he was about 70 at the time) until the filmmakers decide his character needs to do a lot of superfluous gymnastics, for which he is haphazardly doubled, presumably by Yuen Biao.  Otherwise, interesting enough.  Directed by Cheng Chang Ho (""The Association"")  Run time: 85 minutes.  3.5 - 4, out of 5 stars.

1974

THE MANCHU BOXER

Tony Liu (aka Anthony Wau, ""The Big Boss"") plays Ku Ru Zhang, a young fighter who kills a man in a fair fight, but promises his dad that he will not use his kung fu skills again and heads out of town.  On his way to wherever, he befriends an old sickly thief, who soon passes.  Ku travels to the man's home town to tell his estranged family of dude's demise, and takes up work helping to build an arena for an upcoming prestigious tournament.  Meanwhile, Mr. Chin of the Crouching Tiger House hires Kyo Ban (the always-awesome Wilson Tong, ""Daggers 8"") and his brother, Wang Cun (Sammo Hung), to kill as many fighters as possible before the tournament to secure victory for his own evil school.

While it was hard to find a lot of reviews for this film, the ones I encountered were fairly negative.  True, this is no gem, but I've seen & enjoyed far worse.  It's essentially a rip-off of ""King Boxer"" (1972), and a poor one at that, but if you are a general fan of old school basher-fu, you'll likely have a good enough time with it.  It's a rare starring role for Tony Liu, who may best be known to westerners as the tournament fighter from ""Enter the Dragon"" (Liu was in all of Bruce Lee's films) whom John Saxon takes a temporary beating from, in order to hustle a fellow attendee.  The fights in this are decent enough, they just don't occur frequently enough.  Oh, well.  Wilson Tong & Sammo Hung play evil brothers.  Anything cool beyond that would be gravy anyway.  Directed by prolific actor Wu Ma (""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"") with a run time of 82 minutes.  3 out of 5 stars.

THE ASSOCIATION

Fang Ying (Angela Mao, ""Hapkido"") faces the firing squad after killing the man who murdered and/or defiled her parents.  Her father was a military general whose illness watered the mouth of the ambitious Zhao (Chiu Hung, again), who now stands to inherit control of the province. Angela has the ineffectual sympathy of Detective Wang (Taekwondo master Byong Yu) who watches helplessly as she's executed. Meanwhile, there's a woman who's killed from an illegal abortion, which leads Det. Wang to the Welfare Association, where not only are ceremonial abortions performed at a satanic discotheque (which features 3 sustained minutes of painful interpretive dance set to some kind of painful cinematic acid rock fusion), but prostitution as well.  And some other rapist is roaming the countryside looking for rich widows, so Det. Wang hides in...  blah blah blah, the end.

This film is all over the place and will not appeal to those who like their kung fu coherent and, um, breastless.  The discordant mix of debauchery, fights, and absurdity is simultaneously the film's largest asset and liability.  You'll probably want to shower after viewing.  This is Byong Yu's only film and it's presumed that he felt terribly greasy after participating in it, as he should have, and swore off cinema for good. Or maybe people made fun of his afro and said that he looked like Ricardo Montalban?  As a screen fighter, his lack of credits is disappointing, as most of the fighting (which there's not nearly enough of) is pretty good, the best of which features a nice match between him and the always-awesome Whang In-Shik.  As a straight kung fu movie, it's a total failure, especially considering the climax is a shoot-out.  As a movie featuring Angela Mao, it's a total failure considering how little screen and fight time she has.  As a movie that's just a goofy exploitation picture with a couple of nice fights, there may be some appeal.  Directed by Cheng Chang Ho (""Skyhawk""), with a run time of 87 depraved minutes.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

1975.  aka: Operation Ironman

THE DRAGON TAMERS

Kyungnam University Women's Karate class takes on West Beijing University Women's Taekwondo class until the Beijing team's coach, Nan Gong (James Tin Jun, ""Fearless Hyena""), arrives to break it up, but not before some ladies fall into the mud so their breasts can conveniently spill out in slow motion.  Soon after, Carter Wong comes stumblin' into town to issue a friendly challenge to Shen Rongzheng (Hapkido grandmaster Ji Han-Jae, ""Game of Death"") and ends up befriending Nan Gong before training with Bai Mu (Lee Ye-Min, ""Secret Rivals""), an iconoclastic Taekwondo teacher who refuses to join the evil Yan-Mao school's pesky union, even though they wear capes.

This movie is only the 2nd film directed by Jon Woo (""Hard Boiled"") and features a decent amount of decently choreographed fisticuffs.  Many of Woo's themes are explored here, like male bonding.  While there is some exploitation to be had, this is ""Bambi"" compared to ""The Association"".  I liked this better than most Jon Woo movies.  The finale is a little disappointing because the 1-on-1 that the film was building to ends up as a 2-on-1.  Otherwise, pretty sweet, although it probably wouldn't have killed anyone to shave down the 103 minute run time.  3.5 out of 5 stars.
