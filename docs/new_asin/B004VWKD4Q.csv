this courageous woman saved the lives of many children.",1356220800,,178,4.741935483870968
4484899,5,B004VWKD4Q,Excellent book about an excellent woman who risked everything to save children. I wish there had been more Irena Sendlers in Poland and elsewhere where Jews were being murdered.,1356134400,,177,5.137931034482759
4484900,5,B004VWKD4Q,"Eveywhere in this world there are angels and demons.  In this true story, the demons wore swastikas and the angels were Irena Sendler and those who helped her save the lives of little children.  Does it matter they were Jewish children?  They were little children that the demon-murderers wanted to kill.  We had heard the stories of the Poles that had tried to help the Nazis exterminate the Jews and were happy to help.  This story is evidence that there were decent Poles in occupied Poland, that there were people willing to take the chance of being captured and killed themselves in order to do what was right and holy.  Her story resonates in the hearts of all the people who know of the horrors of that period and, maybe, her story will help us be as brave if we are ever confronted by similar circumstances.  The eye-witness accounts were at once powerful and compelling, and the story of this woman would make wonderful drama if it all weren't true.",1347235200,29,958,4.6
4484901,3,B004VWKD4Q,"Irena did something good however, I wanted to know how the hidden children are doing and did they return back to their original  religion and it never stated how well the nuns treated them.  Having been taught by nuns in grade school, they were scary and mean.",1344297600,3,260,4.51063829787234
4484902,5,B004VWKD4Q,"This is a history of what happens when a lunatic gets in charge because a whole heap of lunatics can't make up their minds as to who they are. Some others had to go overboard. I just hope that those who gained know the source of it, love your neighbour, and that it doesn't come of Man because Man is too busy getting the trains to run on time. The essence of human bestiality is well recorded for posterity. Thankyou, Irena, and I hope I am one whom you rescue rather than the one from whom you rescue others. God love you and wipe the map of sub-ape rationalism, on whatever side of the border of mankind.",1332633600,6,607,4.196581196581197
4484903,5,B004VWKD4Q,"This documentary film shows, once again, that Hollywood-level productions are not necessary to produce quality films. By using simple scenery, and non-famous actors and actresses, it gets its point well across. It captures the drama facing Irena Sendler--smuggling children  away from the German-imposed ghettos, and certain death, and placing them in Polish homes. The drama peaks when Sendler is arrested by the Gestapo and is about to be put to death.

There is an actual interview with Irena Sendler, in her late 90's at the time, and shortly before her death. Nuns played a major role in saving Jews. Some of Sendler's rescued Jewish children--now adults--are also interviewed.

Finally, other seldom-appreciated information is presented. For instance, some (e. g., Jan T. Gross and his fans) have leveled the silly argument that Poles were already risking their lives to accumulate firearms for the Underground, and so therefore should have been more willing to risk their lives to hide Jews. The two are not remotely comparable. A hidden verboten inanimate object is a much lesser risk of discovery than a hidden verboten human being. Besides, as mentioned by Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, one of the founders of ZEGOTA, in this documentary, a box of ammunition does not have to eat. (Apart from the difficulty of procuring food under the starvation policies of the German occupation, there is the addition risk of being seen--by informers of any nationality--doing such things as taking implausibly high amounts of food into one's house.)",1332547200,68,1540,5.277551020408163

So sad that Sendler did not receive the Nobel Prize the year that Al Gore won for his work on global warming. Shame on that! This story if Sendler's deeds to save lives is extraordinary.

4484926,5,B004VWKD4Q,Very well done documentary about Irena Sendler and her network of individuals who risked their lives and the lives of their families to help save the lives of many destined for Nazi death camps.  What a travesty that this woman was passed over in 2007 for the Nobel Peace Prize in favor of Al Gore and his convenient lies about global warming.  This woman was a true heroine.,1391990400,,375,4.5
4484927,5,B004VWKD4Q,This is such a sad but fabulous story and I'd never heard of Irena before. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in history or looking for a woman to do a report on. Irena Sendler should be a woman that all children should learn about.,1391212800,,252,4.382978723404255

4484929,5,B004VWKD4Q,"After watching this documentary, I've developed an even greater appreciation for Irena Sendler.

4484934,5,B004VWKD4Q,"The story of Irena Sendler is amazing. She was a Polish woman who, along with her team of social workers, saved nearly 2,500 children and babies from the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw Poland during WWII. Yet, she did not think of herself as a hero,. She thought of the parent's who were willing to give up their children as the real heroes. This is a story worth telling...over and over. More people need to know about the heroic things she and others did in order to save so many children. Three teenagers from Kansas discovered Irena's work and wrote a play and a story to be presented for a history project. The book  ""Life in a Jar"" tells that story beautifully.",1374796800,9,660,4.454545454545454

4484938,5,B004VWKD4Q,This was an amazing story of her love for the preservation of saving the Jewish children's lives.

She organized a team of ladies, and only a few men, and smuggled 2,500 Jewish children out of the Polish Warsaw Getto (1943-45) saving them from the gas chambers. Most of the children were reunited with family after the war.

8444238,5,B004VWKD4Q,"Much of the material in the approximately one-hour long PBS documentary, ""Irena Sendler: In the Name of Their Mothers,"" has been covered in such books as ""Irena's Children,"" by Tilar J. Mazzeo. However, this film adds immeasurably to our understanding of the scope of the rescue effort spearheaded by Irena Sendlerowa from 1939 until the end of the Second World War. Jan Becker narrates this incredible account of valor against the backdrop of black and white archival footage of Nazis torturing and executing Jews; starving men, women, and children in the Warsaw ghetto, staring vacantly with eyes devoid of hope; Jews being shipped in cattle cars to Treblinka; and those remaining in the blazing Warsaw Ghetto jumping out of windows to escape the flames. There are reenactments, as well, all accompanied by a subtle and poignant musical score.

Irena, who died in 2008 at the age of ninety-eight, tells her story in a quiet voice filled with deep emotion. She admits that those horrible days of incredible danger gave her nightmares for many years to come. Irena was a twenty-nine year old social worker when she began helping Jews escape from their German oppressors. She, along with a network of courageous associates, eventually smuggled more than 2,500 children out of the ghetto under piles of garbage, via sewers, and in other ingenious ways. They provided the children with false papers, drilled them in the basics of Catholicism, and hid them in safe houses, orphanages, and convents. Irena kept a careful record of the children's identities in the hope of reuniting them with surviving family members after the war.

Skillfully directed by Mary Skinner, ""Irena Sendler"" gives voice to such heroines as Magda Rusinek (who tearfully greets one of ""her boys, "" William Donat, when he returns to Poland to express his love and gratitude). The hidden children eloquently speak of their painful memories: the terror, desperation, and trauma they felt when their parents sent them away in order to save them. Although the Nazis murdered the vast majority of Poland's Jews, it is inspiring to note that such righteous gentiles as Irena Sendler, Jan Dobraczynski (head of the Division for Abandoned Children at the Warsaw Municipal Welfare Department), the aforementioned Rusinek (a member of the Polish resistance), and Jadwiga Piotrowska (who volunteered to shelter Jewish children in her home), did not stand idly by while their fellow human beings were singled out for extermination. This powerful film would be appropriate for upper high-school students and for adults interested in Holocaust history.",1485648000,2,2608,5.192399049881235
