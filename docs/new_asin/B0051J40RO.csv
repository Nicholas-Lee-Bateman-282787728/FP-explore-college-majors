8452807,1,B0051J40RO,"After viewing this dvd, our trip to Amsterdam is not happening. No reviews of any nice restaurants, hotels and all the items a middle age vacationer would like to see, were presented. None of the panoramic views of the city displayed it in a positive light. A fight of the host of the dvd, in the red light district, does not encourage me to visit this city. Also couch surfing, (staying for free on a strangers couch), and sleeping in a shipping container are not indicative of a relaxing and luxurious vacation. There are no reviews of the shopping and markets for travelers to spend vacation money. This is more of a video of a cheap, no money, weird, type of visit to another country. We are considering booking in Brussels now, thanks to this video.",1419638400,,754,4.551470588235294

8452809,4,B0051J40RO,"This review only pertains to the Amsterdam episode, not the Netherlands episode. Amsterdam is one of my favorite cities. It's not quite as cool as London or Paris, but it's definitely a nice place to visit. This episode featured Brianna Barnes and Jonathan Atherton (most of Jonathan's segments were recycled from the previous Amsterdam episode).

The episode began at Centraal Station. Brianna got off a nice looking train (if only Amtrak was that nice). Jonathan tried speaking to a cab driver in Dutch, but the driver told him that almost everyone in Amsterdam speaks English. He took the cab to the Hemp Hotel (yes, that's really the name of the hotel). Brianna ""couch surfed"" with a Dutch couple. The boyfriend rode a tandem bike with her around town (he was obviously trying to hit on her).

The next day, Brianna went to the top of this beautiful church. The view of the city was impeccable. Jonathan thought it was a good idea to ride a bike on the tram tracks without a helmet. Fortunately for him, he wasn't run over. Brianna traveled with the St. Nicholas Boat Club along one of the city's canals (the city has more canals than Venice). The ride was free, though they accept donations.

Many people visit Amsterdam just to smoke weed. Half the episode consisted of someone getting high. Brianna mentioned that the Red Light District was originally a bunch of brothels built for sailors during the Golden Age. Prostitution is technically illegal in the Netherlands, but the government looks the other way. Prostitutes are taxed, have their own union, and must pass STD tests. While he was in the Red Light District, Jonathan was nearly mugged by a street hustler.

The next day, Brianna went to this automat called Febo. They used to have something like that in the Village in NYC. The episode featured both the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum. I didn't really enjoy either of them, but that has more to do with my personal preference than the quality of the museums. Later, Jonathan went to Vondelpark. It reminded me of Washington Square Park in NYC. Amsterdam is such a nice city. I saw many interracial couples in the park.

Brianna stopped by a replica of a ship used by the Dutch East India company back when the Netherlands had territory in Asia. She passed by the National Science and Technology Center (I wish she went in). Brianna talked about Amsterdam's role in World War II. The Nazis exterminated many Jews in the Netherlands. However, quite a few of them fought back. She went to the Anne Frank house. She told the emotional story of how Anne Frank hid from the Gestapo until she was betrayed. She ultimately died in Auschwitz.

Had the episode ended there, it would've been a 5. I nearly cried during the Anne Frank segment. However, IMMEDIATELY AFTER the Anne Frank segment, it showed Jonathan at the Gay Pride Parade. I have nothing against gay people, but to show a racy event after such an emotional segment was beyond tasteless.

Overall, I enjoyed this episode, but I'm very disappointed with the ending.",1363910400,2,3040,4.757115749525616
