8165085,5,B000LXGWF8,"I disagree with the other reviewer here.  As a collector of these types of dvds, I have seen all kinds of quality over the years.  The Living Landscpaes series is one of highest quality productions I have seen in the genre.

The dvd clearly states that the video is interwoven with music, and I do agree with the reviewer in that I love the option of having nature sounds only, music, or both together on a dvd.  Even though this is not an option on this series. the music is well done, and fits well with the scenery.

I took the time to ask the producer of this series to add this option for future releases, as there are some exciting titles coming up like The African Savannah and The Swiss Alps.  Some of the videos are shot in time lapse, which makes the sequencing of natural sounds difficult, but I was told that this would be a feature that would be added in the future.

I am hoping this will be so, but on that Afican title I want some music that will match the modd of the title for a different experience as well.

Don;t let the above review keep you from adding this title to your relaxation collection.  The scenery is breathtaking, and it is a guaranteed escape to a place that most of us can only dream of seeing in person.  It is well produced, and a true treat.",1203206400,2,1280,4.230452674897119
8165086,1,B000LXGWF8,I FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO BE DISAPPOINTED AND DIDN'T DELIVER AS ADVERTISED.  I WANTED A VIDEO THAT SHOWED THE RAINFOREST IN ALL ITS NATURAL SOUNDS.  THERE WAS NO NATURAL SOUNDTRACK.  IT WAS ONLY CANNED MUSIC.,1179532800,,206,4.828571428571428
