6026279,4,B00FR81YPU,"I watched it people. A CHRISTMAS CAROL - THE CONCERT and I gotta say it...It wasn't bad. Not bad at all. (lol) It was a different kind of musical than I'm used to. See - most musical's I've seen - the cast is running around on stage...like a play - - not A CHRISTMAS CAROL - THE CONCERT...is more set up a like a Presidential debate!! (lol) A singing battle like YOU GOT SERVED!! (lol)

It starts off with ""The Narrator"", played by E. Faye Butler. I liked her. She did a great job telling the story of Scrooge and his 'not so happy ways!' Scrooge is played by Michael Aaron Lindner. I like him as well - the boy can sing. HECK! Everyone can sing in this.

If you get the chance to see A CHRISTMAS CAROL - THE CONCERT...watch it. Not only can you watch this during the holidays  BUTI personally think you can gather the family togethermake some popcornbuy some candy and watch it on a weekend.

I give A CHRISTMAS CAROL - THE CONCERT... 5 out of 5 popcorn's. I think it's a solid musical. It was cool seeing all the different camera angles of the orchestra. Its cool see the play as an old school radio show and Arya Daire as Belle  shes a cutiewho can sing! (lol)",1388620800,2,1163,4.197309417040358

8618194,5,B00FR81YPU,"I watched this show because I was flipping through the TV channels and came across it on the PBS Station. To say that this show floored me would be an understatement. Four very talented individuals put this whole program on. Each playing multiple characters. They seamlessly moved through the story with energy.
  The orchestra was visible in the background. It was conducted by Amy Duran. Just watching her is a treat. Sometimes, you can see her dancing with the music. She is a Broadway pianist, accompanist and composer. She debuted with the Zurich International Opera and has accompanied many vocal recitals around Switzerland and Germany. She is an amazing talent in her own right.
  I enjoyed the show so much that I ordered the DVD so that I could watch it anytime I wanted. I hope you find it just as enjoyable as I did.",1425081600,3,828,4.689655172413793
