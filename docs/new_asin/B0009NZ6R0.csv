8063815,5,B0009NZ6R0,"Two reviews here that praise the film also come down on moral hobnail boots. This is an excellent film. All the moral dicta mentioned are present, but the art is finally art and let the morals be. This is a strange thing to say concerning a film about Brecht who never let the socialist morals be, indeed, made them his art's core. But when this film is over, you have experienced it and taken it inside. You shouldn't feel sorry for Brecht or above him. We all owe God a life that is done with the tools we have, as we owe God a death, and we all are fairly pathetic at the end--Willy Loman, Bertholt Brecht, you and I. (God here = useful fiction.) Well, that's a bit of moralizing, too, isn't it? Moral aestheticism? Aesthetic moralism? Anyway... Acting is brilliant. Editing is good. Story is whole.",1286236800,2,802,4.425675675675675
