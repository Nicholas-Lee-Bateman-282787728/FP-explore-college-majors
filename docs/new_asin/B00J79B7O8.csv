8648586,4,B00J79B7O8,"That name is given to the decendent of the mass...maybe...murderer Grayland who,it is alleged,killed over 200 people with a pair of hair shears. Kiri,a middle-schooler and the  present owner of the shears,now called Cursed Goods, has an obsession with cutting hair,to a point of neorosis. He takes a wrong bus and ends up outside the greenhouse of a shutined middle schooler that has floor lengthed,and un-cutable hair. He cuts it and the adventure begins and it isn't very pretty.
My edition is the same as advertised by Amazon but didn't cost one half this much. The censoring suggested is mostly of the 14-year-old,a naked pre-schooler and the use of a syringe,and there is little of that,at least until the last episode or so.
The subtitling is reasonably well done and the bottom of the TV screen scrolling is rare but does indicate that this is probably not what the copyright owners are releasing as that edition comes out in a couple of months. This ""back-door"",maybe, issue can be found elsewhere for less than half what is being asked for here.",1397347200,,1054,4.855555555555555
