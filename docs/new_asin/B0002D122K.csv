8026602,5,B0002D122K,"Buy just this DVD and 1 Ayoob book to start. I chose ""Concealed Carry."" You can so easily in the gun world gut overloaded with too much info but if you are in your first year of owning or shooting, you want to keep it simple. Dont do what I did and buy 5 books with this DVD at one time! This DVD wll keep you busy for  a few weeks practicing anyway. Very real world info. The only thing they should mention in the preview is you have one exercise youll need rubber bullets (not Zoom blanks,though I use them) but I just skip the exercise with the rubber bullets. Other than that, no complaints. And you want to get some range time in also. But in the end, there is so much training and so many courses you can take, I just look at a lot of web articles and you tube demos and I learn a lot right there. This DVD is for those who want to Concealed Carry anyway, not just for keeping a gun by the bedside.",1346889600,2,904,3.967032967032967
8026603,3,B0002D122K,"I have to disagree with the opinions of the other reviewers (or at least their rating).

The production quality is not very good.  These things come to mind:

1.  The title screen is a list menu with one item in it that says ""1  L  1 11/20/2003 10:17AM"".
2.  The lava lamp type effects in the intro are really unpleasant to look at.  It's the type of thing you see when someone has some video editing software and wants to make use of whatever effects are available just because they can.
3.  Finally, the video isn't broken down into real chapter segments.  Rather the video is broken down into equal segments of roughly 5 minutes.  So, if you hit the next button, you are dropped into a seemingly random place in the video.  This is better than having no chapter markers at all like some videos do.

The content is OK.  I'm new to handguns and I do think this video will help me.  Unlike another reviewer, I don't think that the use of different weapons is at all relevant in this video.  There is not one thing that I can think of in this video that pertains to differences between semi-auto pistols and revolvers.

I appreciate the focus on the fact that ""this isn't a bullseye game"".  Magill points this out multiple times.

I do NOT think this video offers much value in terms of CCW technique.  I'm no expert, but I don't think I learned anything there.  I don't think I agree with the fact that he demonstrates pocket carrying without a pocket holster.  Others may disagree.

Like I said, I think this video will benefit me because I'm new to handguns.  I doubt this would be a very good video for anyone that has more experience than I do.",1238284800,9,1648,4.380794701986755
8026604,5,B0002D122K,"Lenny definitely gives you some good tips on safety (first and foremost). If you have a carriers permit for your state you really should check out this DVD.
Carrying a handgun is a huge responsibility and hopefully you will never have to use it but, knowing how to use it should the time come is crucial. When it comes to self-defense, you want to be proficient and Lenny gives you the practice drills that will take you from so-so to quick and effective handgun presentation. And that may not be necessarily what you want but, it's absolutely what you NEED if you're ever confronted by the bad guy! I got some good stuff out of this DVD.",1235347200,2,638,4.461538461538462
8026605,5,B0002D122K,"In this video,  Lenny Magill teaches the handgun owner how to practice dry fire drills and safe exercises in practicing the handling and shooting of handguns without ammunition so that the handgun owner will have the skills necessary to handle and shoot a handgun when it comes time to use a loaded gun safely and proficiently whether on a shooting range or in a self-defense situation.

Lenny Magill is teaching that proper ergonomics and repetitive action will eventually teach the body to do what is necessary when properly executed action is necessary.  Lenny Magill instructs with an emphasis on self-defense application of using a handgun.  His instruction is consistent with the books written by Charles Stephens, an author on marksmanship who has wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-To-Become-A-Master-Handgunner-The-Mechanics-Of-X-Count-Shooting/dp/0873647092/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How To Become A Master Handgunner: The Mechanics Of X-Count Shooting</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Advanced-Master-Handgunning-Secrets-And-Surefire-Techniques-To-Make-You-A-Winner/dp/0873647874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Advanced Master Handgunning: Secrets And Surefire Techniques To Make You A Winner</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HOW-TO-BECOME-A-MASTER-HANDGUNNER-UPDATED-The-Mechanics-of-X-Count-Shooting/dp/1581606524/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HOW TO BECOME A MASTER HANDGUNNER, UPDATED - The Mechanics of X-Count Shooting</a>.

Lenny Magill repetitively stresses the clearing the weapon of clothes,  getting a good grip on the gun handle, drawing the gun, pointing the gun, proper trigger action.

He introduces 5 methods of drawing the gun from concealed carry means.  He also introduces the use of 4 accessories for safe dry fire practice:  gun mounted laser pointer, loading the gun with snap caps to practice pulling the trigger with sights aligned, the use of rubber bullets without gun powder- only primer to test shots on paper targets, and use of a timer to develop a sense of timing reflex response.

I'm a believer in dry firing and its benefits to develop and maintain skills necessary to use both in self -defense and on the firing range.  A boxer and martial artist might relate this practice to shadow boxing drills or kata.

The video is 75 minutes long.  After that 75 minutes,  you can see Lenny Magill's advertisements for his other videos.

You can find snap caps for sale on Amazon.com.  Just search for them.  There is a good chance that you find some that fit inside your gun.

8026606,5,B0002D122K,"I can draw quicker and shoot better after spending time with this video. Load up your handgun with snap caps and practice along with it. It's repiticious but that's what you need for an instructional video. Several handguns are used from a snubbie revolver to a larger semi-auto and everything in-between. Types of concealment, drawing smoothly and finding the aim point quickly are the highlights. This DVD is excellent for any CCW person newbie or experienced.",1144627200,10,462,5.092105263157895
