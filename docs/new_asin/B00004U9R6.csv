The only available AUDIO was later, poorly, DUBBED in another language.",1516320000,,248,4.444444444444445
7923761,1,B00004U9R6,"Marg Helgenberger plays the weakest, most stupid heroine ever.  Starts out good until her partner's wife is killed.  Even though she is under attack by a sexist co-worker, she allows her partner to sleep at her house with her the night his wife is killed, then has sex with him.  She steals evidence.  Earlier she watched an exchange between a source and her partner and didn't even ask what was in the envelope.  Not a good movie.  Not a good role.",1345766400,,449,4.481481481481482
7923762,3,B00004U9R6,"The movie was in excellent condition and the picture quality is very good. The only thing I have had difficulty with is it's in German.  This is fine as I'm part-German but unfortunately I don't speak German, only English and French.  I cannot seem to activate any subtitles or different language options. Otherwise it was delivered as stated and its condition was very good.",1341792000,,375,4.84375
7923763,3,B00004U9R6,"This movie isn't bad and certainly not great but an okay film to take in if there is nothing else on.

A female cop Rose (Marg Helgenberger), harbors feelings for her partner Stash (Michael Biehn), and becomes involved with him romantically when his wife is killed. As time goes on their relationship threatens Rose's reputation and job. If that isn't enough her own peers on the police force believe she might have something to do with Stash's wife's death. But it also begins to look like Stash is not so innocent himself.

Is Rose being set up? Is Stash to blame? Did he kill his wife and seduce Rose as a part of some crazy scheme? Did Rose kill Stash's wife?

You gotta watch the movie to find out.

This movie has some thrills here and there but what I liked was the chemistry of Michael and Marg. They played their parts realistically and the sexual chemistry was so intense that they sizzled in every scene they were in. This is a hot romance and thriller rolled into one. Not to mention it has a super steamy sex scene.",1327017600,,1028,4.423280423280423
