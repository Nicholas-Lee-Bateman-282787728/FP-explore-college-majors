2218878,4,B0007LPSE0,"For this price you can't beat the value. Seven episodes of outdoor adventure, with a likable cast and some very nice scenery. Robert Conrad
still looks fit and believable as a search and rescue volunteer. I bought this expecting it to be the pilot, and was very pleased to find seven episodes. It's a shame the show didn't get a chance as you can see the cast grow as you watch the episodes. Each episode was better than the previous one. Good bargain, good entertaining show.",1181606400,25,476,4.546511627906977
2218889,5,B0007LPSE0,"The item arrived in great condition within allotted time.  The show is quirky but leaves you wanting more.  Do wish the show lasted longer to get to know the characters and each of their histories...how they came to live in Bear Canyon, etc.  Definitely made in the 90's...gotta love the wardrobe!",1322438400,2,297,4.784313725490196
2218890,5,B0007LPSE0,"The movie was very,very good. I enjoyed watch this DVD.I wish I could remember back then when it was on but i dont. I recommend this to anyone. What the best is about the older movies there is no cussing which is great. Thanks",1319241600,,226,4.159090909090909
2218891,5,B0007LPSE0,I really enjoyed this DVD. I caould watch it with my kids and not a bit of junk(Language or nudity). I suggest hollywood make more of these kinds of DVD's~ Steve,1317427200,3,161,4.225806451612903
2218892,4,B0007LPSE0,"I liked this show. It was fun. I wish it would have had a longer run on tv. The scenery is just beautiful and the actors started to come together. Robert Conrad creates an interesting lead for this group of young actors. I thought about this show off and on over the years after its short run (7 episodes), and now that its available on dvd its been a walk down memory lane. I recommend this show wholeheartedly",1264809600,2,411,4.282051282051282
2218893,5,B0007LPSE0,This is a great series; too bad it didn't last longer.  Unusual characters; good action; well written story lines.  Have watched it twice now.,1264809600,,142,4.875
2218894,5,B0007LPSE0,A must have for Robert Conrad fans. No worries on this purchase its a great series. The networks didn't know what they where doing when they let it be cancled. You know how they are.,1258070400,2,182,4.228571428571429
2218895,4,B0007LPSE0,"We were able to watch this series with our children, and now with our grandchildren. It's good adventure, drama and comedy all wrapped into one, for the whole family. Too bad it didn't last longer! Robert Conrad is a fantastic actor, as are most of the cast. Add this to your collection- you won't be sorry!",1253059200,,307,4.5
2218896,4,B0007LPSE0,"This was Robert Conrad's last series in a career spanning five decades, from Hawaiian Eye in the fifties through The Wild Wild West in the sixties and Baa Baa Black Sheep in the seventies, to a stream of TV movies and quickly canceled series in the eighties and nineties.

Like the even more quickly canceled ""Jesse Hawk,"" High Sierra Search and Rescue was a family affair: Conrad and his wife, LaVelda Fann, played two of the characters, and two of his children from his first marriage produced.  The series was set and shot in their home town of Bear Valley, and included a number of locals in the cast and crew.  Only seven episodes were produced for a summer run in 1995, as a follow-up to a 1994 TV movie of the same name.

Although Conrad and Dee Wallace Stone as the local grocery store owner carry the younger actors, the scenery is the real star.  A single DVD contains all seven episodes, but manages to retain a fairly good quality.  The dialog is a bit lame and plot lines insipid, but for what it is - a simple show about ordinary people in a small California town - it's actually quite good.",1238803200,14,1105,4.41871921182266
2218897,3,B0007LPSE0,"I remember this show when it was on....it was an okay show, not the greatest acting from the younger actors, but passable entertainment...the best part of the show was the natural scenery. But good, mindless entertainment.",1233964800,,222,5.194444444444445

8048406,1,B0007LPSE0,I had watched and really enjoyed High Mountain Rangers and was hoping this would include episodes from that since I have never been able to find that series on DVD anywhere. Evidently it was never done. Episodes in this just weren't that interesting.,1402358400,6,250,4.837209302325581
