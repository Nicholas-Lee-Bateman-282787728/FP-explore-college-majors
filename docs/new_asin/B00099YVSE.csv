All 4 dvd's are great-you get to see how Robocop grows old and obsolete,and his grown up son. Get Them......",1200441600,,171,4.548387096774194
2274081,2,B00099YVSE,"They don't sell this 4 pack in Borders. And when I was at Borders to check for a pre-order, they sold this in 4 separate DVDs for 20 dollars each. Why spend 80 dollars for this movie? And it's 8 hours long. That is a day's worth of watching this miniseries. Bad movie!",1172880000,,268,4.0754716981132075
2274082,3,B00099YVSE,"Supposedly RoboCop Prime Directives was originally a TV miniseries released in 2001. I'm not sure where it aired, but each episode is feature film length and the violence/language varies from PG to R rated material.

The series includes Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection, and Crash and Burn...and the movies should be watched in that order for them to make sense.

Page Fletcher (from HBO's The Hitchhiker) stars as RoboCop. He does about as good a job as Robert John Burke did in RoboCop 3. In fact, the whole Prime Directives series is on par with RoboCop 3...and that's not a compliment. It's not really a knock either. It's a declaration that Prime Directives is an average sequel-set to what were two great initial RoboCop films (RoboCop and RoboCop 2).

Prime Directives takes place ten years after the first RoboCop. Alex Murphy/RoboCop is no longer needed in Delta City and is now considered a nuisance by OCP. John Cable, Alex Murphy's former partner, is killed and brought back as a new RoboCop and is instructed to destroy Murphy/RoboCop.

OCP is now in the hands of corrupt executives (one is a malevolent new CEO, one is Cable/RoboCop's ex-wife and one is Murphy/RoboCop's own son) and they have a new technology called SAINT that they will use to run the city and market to consumers ""to make all of your decisions for you"". But there is a terrorist that wants to infect SAINT with a computer virus that could take down all computers on the net and release a deadly nanotechlogy into humans.

All 4 episodes run apx 90 minutes each, so we're talking about 6 hours of 3-star RoboCop. So if you've got a rainy day and a craving for RoboCop, this series is for you.

As of this writing, the series is available as a set only from Amazon resellers, and the set is about 1/2 the price of buying all 4 separately. But Prime Directives is far from collector caliber, so I'd recommend just finding these to rent, and keep the viewing order that I mentioned earlier in mind.",1156723200,10,1982,4.681034482758621

2274097,4,B00099YVSE,"This isn't going to go down as a great piece of cinema, but probably as a cult classic. I love Robocop and I love the anti-corporate message that has run throughout all of the Robocop movies. Funny to be saying that on Amazon. Anyway, the weak part here is some of the acting and some of the writing, but these movies are made in the spirit of the old Robocop movies, and Robocop fans in general should enjoy them.",1467763200,2,414,4.253164556962025
