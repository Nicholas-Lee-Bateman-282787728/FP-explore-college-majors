2655580,1,B000ICL3MO,Never seen such a bad movie in a long time . . . . OK - there was nothing really excellent to be expected - but this movie really sucks :-(,1214697600,,139,3.5161290322580645
2655581,2,B000ICL3MO,"They did a great job with the dvd case.  They promise a really sexy and sick horror film.  What you get is a rehashed plot you've seen a hundred times, nothing sexy.  Even Kristy Swanson is wasted in the film because she is obviously pregnant the entire time.  Yes there are 5 murders, but aside from the rack sequence, most are common fare.  I would skip this one.",1170806400,41,365,4.3088235294117645
2655582,3,B000ICL3MO,"I watched this last night. It's not as bad as I might have thought. It actually has a somewhat interesting plot. The sound quality stinks though, turn it up high enough to hear the dialogue and the ""music"" (such as it is) is overwhelmingly loud and blasts you away.
Caddish rich-heir-from-Daddy husband, sexy wife (yum, great kisser) and her lover, his best friend. Wife and lover off the cad with blowfish-poison. Only he doesn't die, he is paralyzed like dead but still sees and hears everything but can't move a muscle (""Living Death""). He wakes up on the autopsy table and goes on a revengefest.

A medieval torture stretching rack features twice in this horror-genre flick. Daddy had a hobby, a fully equipped attic medieval dungeon that hubby, and implicitly his wife, use for fun and games. The movie starts with yon cad entertaining a lady friend up there with some erotic moderate stretching on a large angled rack (severe unpadded heavy iron manacles, ouch). Things go awry when his wife surprises them. Startled, he leans too hard on the lever and damages the rackee.

One gets an impression of the rack's dismembering strength but pictures of the mechanism are unpersuasive, just closeups of gears meshing and chains and ropes tightening. The rack figures again at the end of the movie in the vengeancefest, this time as a torture and execution means. No erotic BDSM this time, but pain and dismemberment. The scene suggests the horror of the real thing beyond erotica when it was used for torture and punishment, much less execution.

Anyway, I've seen worse horror-genre flicks. If you're a rack aficionado it's worth a look.",1168992000,28,1639,4.888489208633094
2655583,3,B000ICL3MO,"First of all they took the plot directly from Buried Alive so if you want to see a much better version may I suggust Buried Alive or Buried Alive II.  Second, I still will never understand why someone INSISTS on making a movie (I can understand sitcoms & soaps but NOT movies)when one of the main characters is pregnant and they try to cover it up all during the movie. Sure, they eventually worked it in but only after you spend the whole movie watching the beautiful Kristy Swanson in a completely seductive role walking around in the same dress all during the movie in this obvious bloated state.",1166572800,13,599,4.495412844036697
2655594,5,B000ICL3MO,"Victor Harris (Greg Bryk, looking eerily like a kid I knew from childhood) is a serial killer waiting to happen. We first see him escorting an incredibly beautiful woman, Melanie Pearson, whom he has apparently just ""picked up"" tonight, to his home. After she simmeringly removes her knee high black boots he blindfolds her and leads her upstairs to the attic, the best room of the house. When he takes off the blindfold she sees a room full of torture equipment. She is thrilled, goes over to the rack on which heretics were once ""stretched"" in order to elicit confessions and punish sinners, she leans over it, making sure he gets a very nice look at her amazing cleavage, and says, ""nice rack.""
What happens afterward is gruesome, harrowing, and beautiful to the trained horror eye in a tragic way. This is to me 100% torture pornnot some juvenile peep show into some sociopath's torture basement (BASEMENT!!!) but a real exploration that explores the livid, festering hatred which is ALWAYS the motivation of torture of all kinds (and that's my real life opinion!)
EXAMPLE OF DEPRAVITY 1: Stu, a medical student, believing Victor Harris to be a cadaver, cuts his abdomen open and reaches in up to the elbow. ""This guy has guts,"" he announces. ""Take it easy, Stu, it's not prom night!"" says his fetchingly bespectacled accessory.
EXAMPLE OF DEPRAVITY 2: Stu's other cohort, stressed over the fact that he has just cut open a live human being, pulls a phial out of his jeans pocket, puts it to his nose and inhales deeply.
""What is that?"" asks Stu.
""Meth. I gotta think straight.""
I rest my case.
To my mind, everyone involved in this movie is a major artistic talent. Everyone. Kristy Swanson, call me maybe? jk!",1409184000,,1715,4.739130434782608
2655595,1,B000ICL3MO,Terrible acting. Bad effects. Deceptive advertising for the DVD. This movie is a big waste in more than one way.,1393632000,,112,4.65
2655596,2,B000ICL3MO,It's a b movie at best.  The acting is eh.  The cover is misleading as it really doesn't involve maiming people too much.  The story line has holes in it.  I wouldn't buy this again.,1390176000,,182,4.114285714285714
2655597,4,B000ICL3MO,I thought this had a great plot and portrayed a person that wanted to conspire with another person to get rid of her husband but things went wrong: Very wrong! Only one gory scene. The picture I believe is wrong. She was not being tortured as it appears.,1378252800,,254,4.3125
2655598,1,B000ICL3MO,"do not click to watch this movie, its retarded! the acting is terrible, the filming sucks and it is all around bad",1351036800,,114,4.2272727272727275
2655599,3,B000ICL3MO,"Kristy Swanson stars as the wife of a sadistic millionaire who plots to kill her husband with the help of the family lawyer. Their attempt to poison him fails, and he awakens in the morgue with his mind set on revenge. LIVING DEATH sells itself on being just another Torture Porn entry in a long line of HOSTEL imitators, but it plays out like any other average revenge thriller where money is always the motive. The torture devices laid out in the opening act are not revisited until the final scene, although there are scattered kills throughout the remainder of the run time that offer a decent amount of bloodshed. What really takes away from the film is the uneven tone, where the otherwise serious plot is broken up by unnecessary bits of slapstick in the morgue. LIVING DEATH may not break any new ground, but one can do much worse when it comes to the murder for money theme.

2655600,3,B000ICL3MO,"Living Death: 5 out of 10: If you ever wondered what Body Heat 2 would look like if remade this year and having Kathleen Turner reprising her original role this movie may clue one in? Kristy Swanson hasn't spent much time on the big screen since the mid-nineties and she looks like she has been eating a lot of her namesakes Hungry Man dinners. Don't get me wrong she is attractive as a full-figured woman it simply was a bit disconcerting after not seeing her for a dozen years or so. She certainly hasn't spent that time fine tuning her thespian craft however as she is defiantly the acting weak point in this little drama.

The plot has Shannon Tweed/ Tim Matheson written all over it. Abusive do nothing playboy husband is killed by suffering wife and his best friend/lawyer who is now her lover. Only problem is that they choose a poison that if given in the wrong dose only causes the person to appear dead. D'oh.

He comes back and gets revenge on everyone who wronged him. Sounds like your very standard erotic thriller except it isn't.

There is no nudity and virtually no sex. The only bondage is the decidedly non-erotic leg breaking kind. This is a straight up horror movie and it puts the pedal to the metal.

Main lead Greg Byrk captures our evil protagonist's hedonism perfectly. (The scene where he snorts coke while playing videogames is a classic.) The revenge isn't fair or just it is bloody and cruel.

This creates a great vibe in the film as the only guy to root for is a remarkably unlikable rogue. In fact the film has virtually not one likable hero style character giving an almost Bad Santa feel to the proceedings.

The film picks up the pace about halfway through and never lets go. Not a great film or a genre classic by any means but certainly an entertaining horror film.",1268179200,2,1802,4.512269938650307
2655601,3,B000ICL3MO,"Living Death (Erin Berry, 2006)

Surprisingly, a great deal less stupid than I figured it would be, with really good acting for a straight-to-video release and a plot that, while not terribly accurate in some of its particulars, was at least halfway original and more than halfway interesting.

Elizabeth (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Kristy Swanson) and Victor (Saw V's Greg Bryk) Harris are unhappily married. Victor is a sadistic, infantile playboy, and Elizabeth is just kind of waiting around until he finally manages to kill himself and she inherits his vast estate. She also happens to be romantically involved with Roman (Lars and the Real Girl's Joshua Peace), Victor's best friend and lawyer. The two come up with a plan to get rid of Victor without anyone knowing, but the poison they end up using simply puts Victor into a coma, able to see, hear, and feel everything that's going on around him, but unable to telegraph to the outside world that this is the case. (Fans of The Serpent and the Rainbow or the books of Wade Davis know exactly what's going on here.)

Yeah, it's your basic thriller, but with a few fun twists thrown in and some really engaging, if repugnant, characters. Compared to a lot of low budget horror/thrillers I've seen in January, Living Death is Oscar material. (It's not, of course. Everything's relative.) But even looked at more empirically, it's fun, it's watchable, it's perfect for a rainy night when you've got nothing better to do. ***",1238371200,4,1479,4.861111111111111
2655602,4,B000ICL3MO,"Well, most of the reviews here do a good job of sumarizing this movie but it deserves a little higher rating than it's being given here. This has a dark sardonic tone that makes it kind of an enjoyable but weird horror movie. Not the torture porn garbage the DVD cover would imply, it's a traditional thing more along the lines of some modernized americanized version of some weird lost Itailian horror flick from the 70's. The highlight and SPOILER ALERT HERE is the end. We finally perhaps for the first time in movie history get to see a person pulled apart on a medieval rack. Didn't you really always want to actually see that? I mean the dude's arms and legs come popping off. In a quasi-realistic way that is still somewhat enough reminicent of Hershell type gore to just crack a person up. I am not the herbal enhancing type of dude, but those that pack sticky buds in their bongs will find this something that could be filed as stoner worthy horror ...a midnight movie that never was. Engagingly stupid and weirdly funny, it would be recomended to buy, but Cinemax and other channels constantly show it uncut. Worth checking out.",1234656000,6,1138,4.583333333333333
2655603,1,B000ICL3MO,"First of all, I love Kristy Swanson. Normally she's sexy and easy to watch. In this movie, she is everything but. She is definitely pregnant throughout the making of this movie. Perhaps it would have been better if they had waited until after the baby. The plot is a rehash of old story lines from drive-in thrillers of old. I agree the best is the box cover. Beyond that, nothing to recommend.",1230422400,5,394,4.486111111111111

Most of all, every actor in it played their role exceptionally  well.
this movie was really good, all around,&  one of the best movies in this genre I've seen in awhile.
I look forward to seeing more if this mans movies.
