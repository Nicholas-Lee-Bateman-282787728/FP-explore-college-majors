8420343,2,B004AJDEIW,"Well, this show doesn't start off in a particularly enticing way; when the opening 5 minutes of a show has the viewer shaking his head and pondering just how exactly he's supposed to swallow the huge gaps in logic that the producers expect him to, no good can come of it.

Episode One opens on a man waking up in a room with no memories. He finds that he's in a warehouse, a dark desolate warehouse, and that a very expressionless woman is trying to kill him.

This is supposed to be a ""test"" of the man's abilities to be a candidate for master assassin training. Problem is, the woman already IS a master assassin, so the people who are running this little macabre trial tell the woman to ""go easy on him"".

She complies, and obviously spares him (a master assassin wouldn't miss an exposed stationary target 25 feet away with her pistol), and she even allows him to ""win"" the ""contest of life and death"", all per prior instruction.

Then her bosses chastise her for losing to him, and gives the OK for the man to commence master assassin training.  What gives?  The dude was not particularly skilled in any way, and spent most of the trial cowering in fear and directly exposing himself to gunfire. He had no aptitude that the viewer can see, he should have been slain, but then where would the show be?

Poor plotting within the first 5 minutes is never a good sign.

Furthermore, this show is supposed to be about master assassins.  An assassin doesn't wantonly slay everyone around his target, that isn't what an assassin does.  An assassin kills the target with a minimum of collateral damage, risk of exposure, and personal risk.  However, these 2 assassins do just the opposite.  To avoid massive spoilers, I'll simply quote something from the first episode.

First, however, I'd like to point out that in the beginning of the episode the character was a neophyte with no skills whatsoever.  By the end of the episode, he's a certified master assassin who is sent on a field mission.  He didn't even get a training montage.  ""Even Rocky had a montage...""

This first mission consists of the dynamic duo breaking into a drug lord's mansion, which heavily references the final battle in Scarface.  There's even the famed globe above the fountain (""the world is yours""), albeit a hologram instead of a physical sculpture.

The 2 know that the drug lord will be landing on his exposed rooftop in a few minutes via his private helicopter.  So they infiltrate the mansion and proceed to kill everyone wantonly.  Hero shields are heavily employed, and the drug lord's soldiers are pitiful.  There's also a hilariously bad scene where the female character gets grazed by a bullet during a firefight, and the main character stops to try and see if she needs consoling and coddling over her superficial laceration.  This looks like a paper cut.  It is almost as preposterous as the scene in the Valkyria Chronicles anime where a skirt-clad female soldier runs through a field and is grazed by a high-powered round from a sniper rifle, which leads to a tiny cut and doesn't even break her stride.

After all this preposterous wanton destruction, the assassins exit onto the roof of what is now a charnel house, just in time to ""greet"" the drug lord.  The drug lord's thugs conveniently stand there like morons while they are taken out.  Then the assassins shoot the drug lord with a handgun with such power that it penetrates through the drug lord's skull, and flies off into his helicopter, and causes said helicopter to explode.  Naturally, this attracts unwanted attention.  I suppose a ""master assassin"" can't be bothered with considering overpenetration?

So, these ""assassins"" went in and killed every living thing they could, risked unnecessary injury and exposure, when they simply could have sniped the drug lord when he stepped out of his helicopter.

Ridiculous.  If you've seen & enjoyed live-action movies such as The Professional (Leon) or The Mechanic (Shoot, even if it's just the Statham remake), or even Hitman, you'll bemoan how this show destroys the character of assassins as a whole, a sodality if you will, and will not be able to fully enjoy this show.

If you're questing for a serious show about assassins, don't look here.  Shows such as Golgo 13 (not the movies) and Darker than Black will fulfill that quest.",1301702400,4,4334,4.757697456492637
8420344,5,B004AJDEIW,"A young man with no memories fights to salvage his humanity when he's forced into a life of murder by a dangerous crime syndicate called Inferno. The organization gives him a new name, Zwei, and molds him into a perfect killing machine, a meticulous instrument of death created to obey his masters' every deadly command.

Zwei's not the only puppet controlled by Inferno; Ein is a girl as beautiful as she is brutal, as lethal as she is lost. While mafia violence escalates around them, the two assassins grow closer, and Zwei begins the struggle to reclaim his past and save Ein from a blood-soaked future.",1292371200,16,607,4.726415094339623
