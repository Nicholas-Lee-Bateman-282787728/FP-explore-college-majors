8604138,2,B00EDAGZP2,"Nick Mathers (Richard Carwin) a 20 year man ,is investigating the killings by someone called ""The Grand Master"" (Jai Koutrae). The Grandmaster places a chess piece in the mouth of his victims as the two main characters play an on-line game of chess. The latest murder causes Nick to miss being with his daughter Kate (Ashleigh O'Brien) during her final moments. Nick goes off the deep end as he loses his job, girlfriend (Rosanna Easton) and wife (Abigail Bianca). Nick blames the victims for the death of his daughter Kate, although it appears she died from cancer and it was unrelated to the victims.

Nick is obsessed with the case. He vividly sees and talks to his dead daughter Kate. When the killer takes his other daughter Lisa (Chelsea Giles) Nick must play the killer again in an on-line game of chess where every piece he loses, someone dies.

The movie was a little odd with the dead daughter nagging her dad and not playing a role in the end game. The story was not well constructed and could have used some filler material and editing. There was no background on Kate. There was no development of the girlfriend relationship, they just suddenly appear on screen rather quickly then end. This is a crime/drama/thriller. There is no mystery as we know the killer. We see people imprisoned and tortured, but not slasher film gory, but there is plenty of blood.

Low budget production. Last resort rental.
