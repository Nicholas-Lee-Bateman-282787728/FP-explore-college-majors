7862304,4,6304124775,"Volume 2 has more ""generation gap"" awkwardness - this time host David Steinberg tries his hand as a hippie Psychiatrist counseling a confused Tommy Smothers, who does better in this bit than in his intro for Merle Haggard, who does ""Okie from Muskogee"" - oh, man! - the establishment!! Other ""non-hip"" artists are Steve Lawrence with the non-charting middle-of-the-road/country/pop ""The Drifter"" and his wife Eydie Gorme with the charting Vikki Carr-style big ballad ""Tonight I'll Say A Prayer"". Both are very well sung but *b-l-a-n-d*. Nothing bland about Lulu and ""Oh Me Oh My (I'm A Fool For You Baby, Baby)"" - she gets down deep, almost as good as on the single. Sly and The Family Stone have two segments adding up to four hit songs - they're live and sometimes way out of tune. Bobby Sherman also has two entries, one ""Little Woman"", the huge smash, and the much lesser known ""Sounds Along The Way"". The Grass Roots, The Temptations, the show conductor Pat Williams are also included. ""Promo #2"" by The Rolling Stones is a very short blackout with Keith Richards only, so don't think it's some never-on-record material. The most exciting part (a ""bonus track"") comes from a man who probably had no record contract at the time of taping - Little Richard. He does very familiar songs, ""Lucille"" and ""Tutti Frutti"", but offers powerful new Rock 'n Soul arrangements which support incredible vocals. On ""Tutti Frutti"" he involves the audience in call-and-response. For historians, especially, this is one valuable piece, representing a very under-appreciated and amazing late '60s ""Comeback"" for one of the originators. (Lily Tomlin is also featured in the comedy segments).",971049600,,1676,5.032374100719425
