Spoilers

1.[I-C TITLE LADDER MATCH]-LUKE HARPER VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-we kick off the night with an excellent match, one of the best of the night. This was for the I-C title in Dolphs town so the crowd was really into this one. There were great spots of course but these two had a great back and forth and violent match together. Dolph gets the win in a big crowd pleaser.

2.[TAG TITLES]THE MIZ & DAMIEN MIZDOW VS THE USOS-the second match is for the tag titles and once again the crowd is behind Mizdow since he is hilarious. The Miz is having none of it though taking on the Usos basically by himself. Good match that ends with The Usos winning by DQ after Miz hits them with his slammy. Over all this was a good match that further put Mizdow over just on crowd reaction alone.

3.[STAIRS MATCH]BIG SHOW VS ERICK ROWAN-this match was much better than I was expecting it to be when first announced. Both men come out strong brawling all over the place. The stairs are used outside and inside of the ring. This one was basically a fight and nothing more, which is what it should have been. In the end the Big Show gets the win in a hard fought battle.

4.[TABLES MATCH]SETH ROLLINS VS JOHN CENA-this was a great match right here even though there are some that disagree with me. I thought the battle these guys went through was excellent. Fighting all over the place and tables getting crushed and Rollins getting all kinds of help like a classic heel. This was also the match that saw the return of Roman Reigns, who helped Cena win the match.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]NIKKI BELLA VS AJ LEE-a longer and better match than the last time these two hooked up on PPV. Good match between the two that sees the Bella retaining after having her sisters help during this match.

6.[CHAIRS MATCH]RYBACK VS KANE-this was your typical battle of the big men but once again I think it was better than some people say. The chairs came into play early and throughout the match but they weren't used as much as I thought they would be. Good match with Ryback coming out on top even after taking a massive chair to the face.

7.[US TITLE]RUSEV VS JACK SWAGGER-another good match but it was pretty much like their other matches. Swagger seemed like he was doing well until Rusev unleashed with them power moves and submission holds. Good match over all with Rusev retaining the strap.

8.[TLC MATCH]BRAY WYATT VS DEAN AMBROSE-best match on the card with two of the best wrestlers the company has. I loved this feud from the Shield/Wyatt matches to these guys one on one. These two always go hard and this match may have been the hardest they have been a part of. Dean starts strong controlling the first half of the match but when Bray takes control he takes control. After that they trade momentum using everything they can get their hands on. From tables, ladders, chair, kendo sticks and even TVs. In fact it is that last one that leads to the victory for Bray. This was an excellent match that would see Dean go off of three ladders onto Bray who himself was on a table. Excellent match.

BONUS

1. GOLDUST & STARDUST VS KOFI KINGSTON & BIG E-Kofi and E were representing their new faction The New Day with Xavier Woods. Now all three guys are great, especially Kofi, but this new gimmick doesnt seem to be getting over. I love these guys as a group but I think the fans reaction [or lack thereof] could lead them into a cool heel run. Any way this is a good tag match with both teams looking good. Gold and Stardust are probably my favorite team in the WWE so it was great to see them in action. Goldust has always been a favorite of mine and Cody as really came into his own as Stardust, which I assume was hard since it is based after his brothers character. This was a really good match with The New Day coming out on top, great effort from both teams.

You also get some interviews with Dolph Ziggler and the Bella Twins. This was a really good event that had some great matches on it. I enjoyed all of them from top to bottom and back. I would recommend this to any wrestling fan out there. All of the matches here were great and fun.",1422403200,5,4129,4.383006535947713

6860357,3,B00Q7SLCCY,"The Ladder match for the IC title between Dolph Ziggler & Luke Harper was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth brawl with a great finish to boot. The Tag Team title match between The Usos (Jimmy & Jey) against The Miz & Damien Mizdow was a total comedy bout but sightly entertaining to say the least. The Steel Stairs match between Erick Rowan & The Big Show was a dud. The Tables match between John Cena & Seth Rollins was mediocre with a lot of TNA-style interference to boot. The Divas title match between Nikki Bella & AJ Lee was fine at best. The Chairs match between Kane & Ryback was WCW Sin bad. The US title match between Rusev & Jack Swagger was a pointless filler squash bout. The TLC match between Dean Ambrose & Bray Wyatt was a hardcore,crazy,ECW-style brawl even with the goofy ending. I give this PPV a  6 out of 10.",1421280000,,822,4.407894736842105
6860358,3,B00Q7SLCCY,"Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Luke Harper vs. Dolph Ziggler - Dolph was in his hometown here as both men went for the ladders on the outside right away and the action never stopped from there as Luke used impactful offense both in & outside of the ring including being thrown into a section at ringside that would become a target throughout the night & one move that looked like it could have broke his arm to the point where you saw Dolph's showing the effects all of his body in more ways than one but still brought the fight as well using the ladders to his advantage to make more of an impact with his offense including an X-Factor or DDT & using one ladder to bridge to another.  This was the breakout performance for Luke Harper while Dolph continued to deliver & ""show off"" for his hometown crowd in one of those matches that had both men coming out looking strong.

Tag Team Champions The Miz & Damien Mizdow vs. The Usos - This was a homecoming for Miz as well but was overshadowed by his stunt double as Mizdow continued to mimic every single thing the Miz did to the cheers of the fans chanting ""We Want MIZDOW!"" to the point where some of the things he did even made The Usos shrug their shoulders as they did their usual fast paced offense using teamwork with high flying while  having fun at their opponents expense & debuting a new submission hold but in a match that was solid but had a very flat ending making this match come off as filler more than anything else.

Stairs Match: Big Show vs. Erick Rowan - A first of it's kind in WWE history that started out with both men brawling hitting some offense such as a standing spinkick in the ring & bodyslam on the floor before the stairs came into play in various ways from either having them rammed or being thrown into them with the match continuing on the outside with a body being thrown into the timekeeper's area (second time of the night) & the stairs placed in a position that freaked out the announcers with the steps being using in various unique ways such as being wedged between the ring ropes & one man coming off the middle rope with the stairs with a result that didn't end well for anyone while later one man going through a setup of stairs that was compared to ""Stonehenge"" in what was an nice big man brawl with the stairs adding to the match making it better than it would have been without it.

Tables Match: John Cena vs. Seth Rollins - Paul Heyman was at ringside as you saw the direction this match was going in the opening moments with J&J Security getting heavily involved with distractions & preventing Cena from using the tables with Cena resorting to using other weapons & tactics on the outside from the stage area to the timekeeper's area (notice a pattern here?) with Seth also having no problem using other objects at ringside to his advantage along with showing his athleticism to avoid going through the table as the match went on with multiple tables broken by more than one body throughout the match with one particular man being slammed on a specific table that didn't give along with a few unexpected surprises.  This match was pretty much like Cena's feud against The Wyatt's earlier in the year in that if you can get past the finish (which you can't help but expect knowing the stipulations going into this match), as it did have some entertaining action but was pretty much a glorified handicap match.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. A.J. Lee - A.J. had to fight off both Bellas early before Nikki was able to get the advantage focusing on the back area with various stretches including looking like she was trying to snap her in half at one point while A.J. worked over the head & neck area with some impactful offense of her own along with a submission attempt in what was a nice match between the two working as hard as possible.

Chairs Match: Ryback vs. Kane - We got a battle of dueling chairs within the opening minute as both men used the chairs to punish each other with repeated chairshots on different areas of their bodies & making their offense such as a DDT & spinebuster more impactful to unique ways throughout the match from it being wedged in the corner between the turnbuckles to using it to block & counter each other's offense such as one man just launching it like a fastball at the other as some things here just didn't seem to click here between these two but had the chairs stipulation help make the match between than it would normally been.

United States Champion Rusev vs. Jack Swagger - Rusev was coming into this match with a bad ankle while Swagger had revenge on his mind for Zeb Colter's broken leg as he heavily targeted it using the ropes & using his own offense against him as both men exchanged a series of reversals & counters to each other's attempts at a submission along with some power strikes as this resembled their previous matches where they had good chemistry but nothing different than what we've seen before.

T.L.C. Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Bray Wyatt - This match started off with a bang as one man had a ladder launched at him right away as they fought around ringside into the crowd including one area that I've been waiting for a fight to happen at for close to a year now with both men using all the legal weapons along with some other's such as kendo stick to punch different parts of the body in some unique ways such as using the top rope to come off or get put through a weapon including one time that make Lawler say ""your not suppose to floss with a kendo stick"" as both men just attempted to play ""can you top this"" with the crazy way they used the weapons & sacrificed against each other just to hurt their opponent with the most impact possible including Ambrose trying to give Bray a taste of his own medicine for the attack on his throat days earlier as this resulted in a match that had it's share of highlights & was one of the most physical matches using this stipulation with the only negative thing being the way the ending came off & the fact that it was very similar to what he saw only an hour earlier.

(Preshow) The New Day vs. Goldust & Stardust - The New Day combination in this match was Kofi Kingston & Big E. with both men showcasing good combinations of athleticism & strength such as a Big E launching Kofi over the top onto both opponents along with double team offence like a backdrop & Kofi dropkick on the way down or big ending followed by Kofi top rope crossbody combinations while the Rhodes concentrated on slowing down the pace & grounding both men keeping them in their half of the ring along with using the ringside environment & distractions to their advantage in what was a solid tag team match from both men but was overshadowed by the announce team more focused on making references to a Flintstone's character that Stardust resembled with his face paint than the match itself.

WWE returned to the different match stipulations for each weapon this year & included a new one which always T.L.C. one of my favorite events of the year as it usually makes some of the better than we would have had with a regular one on one encounter which was the case this year but the big negative here was all of the finishes that happened throughout the show coming off very flat or corny to just bad so if you can get past that happened throughout the night then this years edition was an overall solid show.",1419206400,,7409,4.443708609271523

8690814,4,B00Q7SLCCY,"I thought this was a pretty good PPV event - it delivered in most matches but some seemed like they were lacking..

1.  Luke Harper vs. Dolph Ziggler - Ladder Match:  I thought this was a good match overall and Luke Harper keeps impressing everytime I see him as a singles competitor!  He's a big, tough guy but in a ladder match that is a disadvantage... so I knew automatically that Ziggler was gonna win since he could use his quickness to get up the ladder.  If it wasn't a ladder match I think Harper would have won hands down the way he was dominating Ziggler!  Great match - 8/10

2.  Miz/Mizdow vs. The Usos - Tag Title Match:  Here we get more of the stupidest gimmick ever to be seen in a wrestling ring with Sandow copying every move the Miz does!!  This makes absolutely no sense to me - Sandow is a great wrestler with lots of potential - it's a shame the storywriters are having him waste his time and ability like this!!  He oughta be wrestling for the U.S or IC title, but NO - he has to follow Miz around and act like an idiot!!  Too bad!  Thank goodness this gimmick stopped soon after this event!  The match wasn't all that great either - probably a 4/10 with Miz taking on the Usos all by himself!  Really forgettable in my book!

3.  Big Show vs. Erik Rowan - Steps Match:  This match was okay but it was basically two big guys bumbling around ... similar as a One Man Gang vs. Vader match would have been back in the 90's!  I wonder why Big Show goes through all the trouble of setting his opponent up for a choke slam when all he has to do is knock them out?? Always intrigues me!  Gee - I can't even remember who won this match... I must be getting old!  LOL!!  I can say Erik Rowan is coming into his own in singles comptetition, much like Luke Harper is!  Seems like I remember Big Show winning this one... but anyway I'll give this a 7/10.

4.  Seth Rollins vs. Cena - Tables Match:  I thought this match was great!!  The action went back and forth as all good matches do... as much potential as Rollins has (reminds me of a young Shawn Michaels) I don't think he can beat Cena right now in his career - Cena's just too tough... I guess J & J Security knew that too which is why they kept trying to interfere - I knew that for Cena to win he'd have to beat up the two stooges, which he eventually did - Rollins gave a good go of it but Cena came out on top in the end!  I think this is the best tables match I've ever seen!  9/10

5.  Nikki Bella vs. AJ Lee - Divas Title Match:  Awww how beautiful are the Bella Twins - AJ Lee too!!  I must say I don't think the Bellas can pull off Twin Magic anymore since Brie is now much thinner than Nikki is... both are still gorgeous though!  Okay - enough of that...  this was a much better match than at Survivor Series - AJ always impresses me even though she's outmatched by size every time!  I think she's the Rey Mysterio of the Divas division!  Anyway - loved the ending with Brie distracting the ref and Nikki spraying something in AJ's face!  And how about Nikki's forearm smash and ""the rack"" submission??  Eat your heart out Lex Luger!!  This one gets an 8/10 from me!!

6.  Ryback vs. Kane - Chairs Match:  This match really surprised me as I thought Kane would win this because of his experience!  This was okay with both guys using chairs on each other...  nothing really special though - just two big guys duking it out like Rowan and Big Show did earlier.  Ryback was impressive though picking up Kane for his ""Shell-Shock"" move at the end - 7/10.

7.  Rusev vs. Swagger:  I wonder how many times Swagger is gonna try before he figures out he can't beat Rusev??  LOL!!  Actually I think Swagger could but it might take him about another 5 tries or so!  I think the Rusev-Russian story line is really great and draws lots of heat on Rusev!  I wouldn't like Rusev at all if it wasn't for Lana!!  But as long as Lana is happy - I'm happy!  LOL!!  Well this was your usual Swagger/Rusev match with Rusev coming out on top as always ...  7/10.

8.  Wyatt vs. Ambrose - TLC Match:  This, along with Rollins/Cena was the match of the night!  For a big guy, Wyatt can MOVE!!!  Reminds me a lot of Mick Foley in his hey-day!!  Ambrose is another top star of the future and will be a World Champ someday!  Both have great chemistry in their matches and they know how to exhibit their craziness!!  Really cool!  The only thing I saw about this match is the overkill of Ambrose jumping off the ladder on Wyatt!  How many times does he think he needs to do that to make his point??  At least now I know why he pulled that ladder in the ring to pose on it at Survivor Seriers - to build this match up!  And why in the world wouldn't Ambrose unplug the TV before using it??  Common sense should tell him to unplug it!!  LOL!!  Anyway it would up sparking him in the face in the end and he'd run right into a ""Sister Abigail"" maneuver from Wyatt for the win!!  9/10 overall!!

Well that sums this one up for me - overall this was a good event but not quite as entertaining as Survivor Series!  I'd still recommend it to WWE fans!",1431475200,2,5097,4.1623843782117165
