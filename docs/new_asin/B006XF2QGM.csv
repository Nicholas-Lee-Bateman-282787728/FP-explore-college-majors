8506275,4,B006XF2QGM,"I showed this documentary in my senior English class at the beginning of our ""Kite Runner"" unit. It does a wonderful job of showing the reality of Soviet & American influence in Afghanistan. It also has captivating anecdotes from Afghan citizens that provide even further insight into life in Afghanistan and Afghan culture. Unlike the first reviewer, I think that the narrator and the people in the documentary were easily understandable. There were subtitles when needed.

Important to know before screening:
- The previews are confusing. Skip to the main menu
- Graphic bloody wounds
- Scenes of death and dead bodies (including a hanging)
- Violence
- Some cursing
- There's a lil nakey baby

Overall, I think this documentary is well worth the graphic scenes. My students need to understand the things that influence not just the novel ""The Kite Runner"", but also what influences modern politics in the Middle East.",1521590400,,920,5.006535947712418

8506277,5,B006XF2QGM,"I, like the other reviewer, am writing this because I thought the movie was very well done and not difficult to hear.

After searching for a film to show my students to give them a background to Afghanistan, a country that has been painted in a very negative light in our society, I decided on this film.  Because the filmmakers were independent, they are less bias than many other films I previewed.  Afghanistan's history is so rich and complex that I felt that my students would benefit more from seeing rather than simply reading about it.

Overall, this movie is great and I definitely recommend watching it.",1395014400,,613,4.700934579439252
8506278,5,B006XF2QGM,The footage and information in this documentary is the most insider look at Afghan history that I have ever seen in a film. Very thorough and compelling look at the background of this fascinating country. Covers several decades of Afghan history. Not to be missed by those who are interested. I wrote this review because the only other review of this film was foolishly ignorant. This is one of the best documentary films I have ever seen! And I can understand the speaker easily.,1352160000,4,480,4.726190476190476
8506279,1,B006XF2QGM,The person speaking in this documentary was difficult to understand since there was background noise going on during the entire documentary and the person speaking was drowned out by this noise.  I wish I hadn't bought it.,1348704000,,222,5.0
