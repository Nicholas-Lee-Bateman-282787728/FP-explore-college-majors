353197,5,6301759281,"I have been a life-long Garfield fan; we literally grew up together! (His ""birthday"" is on June 19, 1978, and mine is July 12, 1978) I  watched this special when it first came on TV about, oh, 15 years ago or  so. I taped it, and I have watched that tape I don't know how many times. I  also watch it every year when it comes on. I know the words to every song,  and I can usually speak the dialogue with the characters. I am not ashamed  to say that, at the age of 22, this is still one of my all-time favorites!  This is Garfield animation at its best, and everyone should have the  privilege of watching and enjoying this classic!",967766400,6,633,4.097560975609756
353198,4,6301759281,The (real) dynamic duo sets out on a pilaging adventure on Halloween Night to get a lot of candy and end up stranded on an island where the only inhabitant is waiting for his dead pirate pals to show up from the grave  and reclaim their treasure. VERY entertaining comedy made for children and  funny enough to make the adults crack up. A perfect holiday flick and the  best Garfield special so far.,945734400,5,399,4.438356164383562
353335,2,6301759281,"For some reason the music volume is much louder than the dialogue, and it's nearly impossible to hear the dialogue at times. Additionally, when I first tried to watch it, I kept getting server errors. Only avoids one star because I eventually got to watch it. My VHS copy was better, though.",1416700800,,291,4.615384615384615
353336,1,6301759281,"As others have mentioned, there is no audio on this instant video. At least not on the Thanksgiving episode. The first episode I watched had audio, but it was pretty awful.

I wrote Amazon about the issue and rather than attempt to find out what the problem was and maybe try and get a video with audio up there, they just very quickly refunded my purchase with a ""sorry, we can't find a solution."" Considering it took them all of five minutes to send that response to me, it's obvious they put forth zero effort and are just hoping they can avoid doing actual work by issuing refunds. It's disappointing because I'd much rather be able to watch the cartoon than just have money thrown back at me. 'twas a staple of my youth, and I was hopeful I could take a walk down memory lane. But I was thwarted.

Long story short, don't waste your money because you're just going to end up asking for a refund anyway.",1416268800,,907,4.3609467455621305

Also, this does not include Garfield Christmas.  I was exteremly happy to find this on Amazon Prime, and even downloaded the Halloween Adventure to my PC for $2.

353708,4,6301759281,"My son started loving Garfield about 4 years ago and he still loves it...especially with its availability on Amazon Prime.  If you love Garfield comics you'll probably love the Garfield cartoons.  Be forewarned though....all the not-so-attractive character qualities Garfield exhibits in the comics are there in abundance in the videos.

The Big Busy world of Richard scary"" Beetle Juice ""Guts"" Wild & Crazy Kids very good show in the 90s bout kids being kids celeberity was always guest host...

But this was the Halloween episode, my favorite from my childhood and my husband's as well and I just couldn't resist the urge to watch it again - instantly - and share it with our children.

I do agree that the sound quality was not good. We did not, however, find it to be intolerable. I needed to adjust it way more often than I would have preferred but none of the four of us watching were greatly annoyed by this.

So for us seeing an old favorite was worth the effort and our children didn't mind the sound quality much either. But I can definitely understand how it would bother others even to the point of not watching it so you'll just have to use your own judgement on that.

Buying it on DVD as opposed to watching it on instant video is also a good option and I may even end up doing that myself. But personally I wasn't sorry that I caved and spent the <$2 on the download.",1363651200,,1002,4.208333333333333

353793,2,6301759281,"This is a review specifically for the online video of ""Here Comes Garfield"".  It's an impressive example of vintage TV animation.  What's entirely unsatisfactory is the sound quality of Amazon's offering.  For some reason, the dialogue is very quiet, even muffled, even at volumes where the music and sound effects get uncomfortably loud.  It's hard to say what went wrong, or when:  Maybe it's a problem with how the recording plays back; maybe it's an issue of how different tracks were preserved; it might even be that the original dialogue recordings were subpar.  Whatever the reasons, it's a thoroughly disappointing and even unpleasant experience.

I wanted to find it so that my 3 year old could watch a cartoon I used to watch she loved it, only bad part was that the previews it had before and after were not what any parent expects it was somewhat sexual and seductive. I believe they were chinese films but either way enough to make me not want to put it on for her anymore.

353883,5,6301759281,"This is one of the best cartoon specials I can remember from the 80s. We taped it from TV, along with the Christmas, Hollywood, and In the Rough/Camping specials.  But it got so worn out and then we couldn't find it, so I found a dvd of the holiday ones on ebay. I still remember most of the songs and sing along.

The best song is the one about Garfield's halloween costume, and he's trying on the junk in the attic. ""What should I be?..It's all up to me...An astronaut, a robot, a hobo, a clown? An alien invader going out on the town?..."" Maybe the words aren't quite right. Anyway, it's just one of those cozy cartoon memories where you feel safe and happy watching it. Mourning your childhood, kind of. I also love the part where they're chased out of the house by the pirate ghosts.

I recommend the comic book too. It's a little different from the tv version, but pretty accurate! (and the skull's facial expression on Garfield's hat changes, which is a pretty interesting detail, I think)",1155686400,3,996,4.461538461538462

She never fails to disappoint in the humor department. And what's Jon thinking, trying to cook a fully-frozen turkey at 500 degrees for about an hour? It's clear Mom never taught him to cook. Garfield goes to the vet once again, if only for Jon's benefit. Can Jon keep Liz from being bored to death on their Thanksgiving date? Can Garfield survive his new diet? Can Grandma pull a miracle recipe out of the hat and save Thanksgiving? Buy this great cartoon and find out!

P.S. I agree with the previous review about storing food in the lower shelves. Didn't know people kept fridges down that low. Only in a cartoon.",1142467200,,777,4.433566433566433
353885,5,6301759281,"Until this was recently released on DVD as part of the Garfield Holiday Celebrations, the only way to see this was if you had owned in on VHS since they don't show this one on TV anyore.  That's such a shame as this is one fantastic Halloween special.  It originally appeared on CBS in 1985.  Garfield and Odie go trick or treating and wind up in a real haunted house..much to their horror.  Lorenzo Music was hilarious as Garfield and Tom Huge was fantastic as John and Binky the Clown.  If you love the season of Halloween and autumn time then this is the perfect animated feature to watch.  What a treat that this is now on DVD.",1127433600,,631,4.305084745762712

I also liked the part with Jonny Bop and the Two-Steps. My favorite part was when Garfield shouted, ""All your mothers wear army boots!""

353953,5,6301759281,"If there is one thing that kids are going to pick up from animated Thanksgiving specials featuring their favorite cartoon and comic strip characters it is going to be that cooking a Thanksgiving dinner is hard work (which would explain why the kids are parked in front of the television watching parades and animated Thanksgiving special featuring their favorite cartoon and comic strip characters while mom is in the kitchen doing the hard work and dad is staying out of the way watching football).  This lesson is amply illustrated in ""Garfield's Thanksgiving,"" where Jon (voice of Tom Huge) is in charge of doing the turkey with all the trimmings, which, you know, is never going to work (even with the magic counter).  Meanwhile, a bad situation is made even worse when Garfield (Lorenzo Music) is forced to go on a diet just as Turkey Day is approaching.  Throw Odie (Gregg Berger) and Dr. Liz Wilson (Julie Payne) into the mix and it is a good thing that Grandma (Pat Carroll) will be around to save the day.  All things considered, this is one of the funnier Thanksgiving animated specials and is a good bet to make the kiddies giddy.  However, as always, parents will have to watch this one at least once to explain who Orson Welles was and other jokes that are going to go right over the heads of the kiddies.  Note: Actress Julie Payne is the daughter of John Payne (""Miracle on 34th Street"") and Anne Shirley (formerly Dawn O'Day, who changed her name to Anne Shirley to play Anne Shirley in ""Anne of Green Gables"").",1069632000,3,1527,4.657992565055762
353954,5,6301759281,This is absolutely a holiday classic.  I can still remember looking forward all October to when this would be shown on TV.  Unfortunately it seems to have fallen off the yearly Halloween programming schedule.  What makes matters worse is the inability to purchase a new copy of it. Video distribution of this (and the other Garfield adventures) is handled by Fox Television.  I encourage you to do as I have:  email/write/call Fox and demand that they release these staples of holiday traditions on DVD!  There is no reason why they should fall by the wayside.  Kids growing up today should be able to enjoy these as we all once did (and still do).,1067299200,3,648,4.68141592920354
353955,4,6301759281,"One morning, Garfield wakes up to the Binky the Clown show.  He's really mad that he is woken up so early, but then finds out that it is Halloween.  (His little song he sings is priceless!)  Now, as you might know, Garfield LOVES candy, so he is very excited about this, so he looks for a costume.  (Yet again, another priceless song is sung!)  He ends up going as a pirate.  He gets Odie to dress up as a member of his crew, and they set off with Garfield singing a catchy song about not being a scaredy cat. (""I may be sassy!  Yeah, that's all of that!  But the one thing I'm not is a scaredy cat!""  Sorry.  As I said, it's catchy.)  The two get a ton of candy, then decide to go on a little boat ride, but get lost, and can't turn around.  They find an old house alone on a island, and decide to go inside. There, they meet a 110 year old cabin boy.  (He's still alive!  Can you believe that!?)  He tells Garfield, and Odie the story of a treasure that was buried in the house.  At midnight, the pirates will come to get the treasure.  It starts to thunder, so the two run out to the boat, but it's gone.  They're stranded on the island.",1067126400,,1140,4.0358744394618835

354027,5,6301759281,"I have watched ""Garfield's Thanksgiving"" every year at Thanksgiving and I never grow tired of it. It's funnier than any other Thanksgiving cartoon show ever. Here in this cute and top-notch cartoon show, Jon and Garfield have a successful shopping trip to prepare for Thanksgiving. Then they have to go to THE VET! Garfield is so tensed up, that Liz, the vet, says that Garfield has to go on a diet while Jon tries to break a date with Liz in an unusual way: he holds his breath until she says she'll go out with him. He held out pretty long. The diet is torture for Garfield, but Jon can't wait for the next day. Get this. When he's about to pull everything he needs the next morning, he takes out everything from underneath the counter including the turkey itself. That counter must have a miniature fridge and everything down there. He sets the oven at 500 degrees. That's broil! It all turns out well, before Jon ruins the whole meal, but it's Grandma to the rescue. Jon tries to stall Liz off by telling her about what countires call their Thanksgiving and the whole history. Grandma is busy in the kitchen and ready to preare the table. That is quick work. It's a nice dinner scene in there, and it sort of warms you. Don't miss this Thanksgiving treat that should include a stuffed turkey. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!",1038268800,3,1312,4.516806722689076
354028,5,6301759281,"Garfield has made me laugh for years. I was so glad that this show aired again a few years ago, because since then it hasn't been on TV since. Garfield gets his Halloween inspiration to trick-or-treat from that ""awful clown"" Binky. The next morning he wakes up saying, ""Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, CANDY, CANDY! Hello, Halloween! What a glorious day and a glorious night to go trick-or-treating...for candy, candy, candy, candy, CANDY!"" He and Odie, who gets the inspiration passed from Garfield, pick out their costumes for the night. They dress as swash-buckling buccaneers. After a sucessful night, they discover a dock on a lake with a small lifeboat attached to the boat. They sail across the lake. After sialing into a patch of fog, Garfield realizes they're lost and wants to go back home. Suddenly, land ho! They discover a rickety old mansion. As they quietly make their way inside and sit by the fire, they turn around and see a spooky-looking and mysterious old man seated in a chair. He tells them of an old pirate legend about how 100 years ago on that night they buried treasure somwhere on that island, and 100 years later they would return to get it...even if it meant returning from the grave! Garfield and Odie decide to leave and notice the man is gone. Out of the house they run and see the old man stole their boat. At midnight, an eerie looking ghost pirate ship arrives. Close-ups with pirate ghosts and escaping adventure as Garfield and Odie evacuate the mansion, swim the lake back to the other side. They see their boat, and leave with their candy. Back home , they each get their share of the candy. Garfield turns on the TV and sees the old man saying in an Alfred Hitchcock voice, ""Good evening, and welcome to the all-night pirate movie festival."" Garfield turnd it off saying, ""Boy, am I tired."" He lays down and says in his pirate voice ""Arrr..."" It's no trick, but it's one Halloween treat.

354029,3,6301759281,"I was disapointed that the story wasn't as good as Garfield's Christmas and Garfield's Halloween. The animation in Garfield's Thanksgiving wasn't as good as the animation in Garfield's Christmas. Jon's Grandmother was very funny. The actress who did the voice of Jon's Grandmother also did her voice in the Chrismtas Special, so I disapointed that Jon's Grandmother's voice didn't sound the same. Because she is my second favorite character in Garfield's Christmas.
This is a [poor] excuse for a Garfield Holiday Special. It's not worth the high price that it is selling for. I do have it in my collection. But I didn't pay over $...for it.
