2710709,5,B000LAZQGW,"Through the incorporation of multiple strategically placed cameras, including helmet cams, the filmmakers, who achieved a similar, grunts-eye-view in 2014s The Hornets Nest, create an undeniably palpable experience.

2710710,4,B000LAZQGW,"First off, I have a positive bias for those who fought and documented these long wars.  In terms of content consumption, this would be a pass for other documentaries such as Restrepo.  While the final product is well polished, the action from a military perspective is quite benign.  Nevertheless, I long for the day that we bring back conscription and resurrect the citizen soldier.",1472515200,,383,4.953125

2710712,5,B000LAZQGW,"Be ready to take a ride on the wild side when you watch this movie! This film follows the tour of duty of a group of National Guardsmen from Oklahoma, and although they are from all walks of life they bond together to form one heck of a fighting team. Enduring IED's, RPG'S, machine gun fire, and the harshness of the environment they keep up their mission to protect our way of life. This is a well made documentary, and the way it is shot it makes you feel as though your right there with them. You really get to know them too, and see some of their funny exploits. These men are one great group of guy's, and they will no doubt make you ""Proud to be an American""!",1472515200,2,666,4.130769230769231
2710713,1,B000LAZQGW,"I thought this would a movie that went along with the book by the same name.  That book is about soldiers in WWII, and this is about some of the new trooops.  That is all I didn't like about it but the movie itself showed our brave young guys in one of the current war zones.  I am a veteran so I will never say anything negative about our troops.  It was ust not what I expected.",1396483200,,380,3.896103896103896
2710714,5,B000LAZQGW,"This movie was made from real footages from cameras and helmet cams. It tells the story of Oklahoma Army National Guard's 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Afghanistan. Its intense, bloody and heart-breaking. It shows IEDs and RPGs killed many U.S soldiers.

The last scene when some of them had to recover the body of one of their members from the bottom of a cliff during a fire fight is heart breaking.

If you like true stories, war movies, and raw courage, this is a must.",1512604800,,480,4.569767441860465
2710715,5,B000LAZQGW,"Thank you for showing this in it's real, raw form.  This is exactly what our fighting men, and women, go through on a real mission.  The boredom they go through is ominous.  Like the man said, it's long periods of boredom...  Interrupted by seconds, minutes and/or hours of sheer terror.  You can see the pain in their eyes when they are remembering the friends they lost.  They are a family:  Brothers, and they will be until their last breath.  No one can say they know what it is like, if they have never served in a grunt unit under combat conditions.  The parts of the film, where the injured soldiers refused to med-evac until all of their brothers have been gotten out, is very real.  We will never leave a fallen Comrade.  We make sure everybody goes home, no matter what condition they are in.  I would never want to be in a unit that did not do this, and I never have.",1511740800,,878,4.319018404907975

2710719,5,B000LAZQGW,"It's all first-hand footage of their actual missions during their deployment, as well as personal interviews. There's no acting here - only real footage of real guys on a real mission. I'm amazed they were able to film so much of it.

Pretty humbling but a good reminder that we're still at war and we still have guys in hell-holes like this sacrificing their time, energy, and lives to keep our country and the world safe.",1510358400,,423,4.565789473684211

2710721,5,B000LAZQGW,"Beautifully filmed in Oklahoma and in the rugged mountains of Afghanistan, this poignant documentary follows the lives of ordinary citizens who served their country overseas. 'Citizen soldiers' are a special breed; they are not professional military, career soldiers, or elite. They are National Guardsman, state militia, who's first allegiance is to their state of residence, where they respond to natural disasters and keep order during riots, looting. Many never expect to be sent overseas, much less into combat that full-time, professional marines and soldiers face. That's what makes this film so special. These are ordinary men who were called up and did their duty; and in doing so save the lives of other Americans, much less those that would potentially be drafted. I absolutely loved the intimate depiction of brotherhood, as shown between modern-day interviews, combat footage, leisure time while ""in the suck"", and a fitting end which left me feeling tremendous pride for our young men that volunteer to do such dangerous work. I feel honored getting to spend a short amount of time with these men.",1509321600,,1111,5.247191011235955

2710726,5,B000LAZQGW,"I knew Damon through my wife, my brothers from the PD knew Mycal.  The pain is real. The loss is incalculable.  This is war as we know it today. I lost more friends than I care to count to this war.  If you watch this and don't walk away with a better understanding of what our fathers, sons, brothers, uncles, mothers, sisters, aunts and daughters are dealing with then I am at a loss.  This hit me so hard and brought back memerioes that I had suppressed or forgotten.
It was beautifully done and speaks to the 45th's professionalism as a whole.  Look into the history of the 45th and you will see what makes Oklahoman's proud to serve in the National Guard.

2710731,5,B000LAZQGW,"As an Airman of 19yrs...I respect these guys a whole lot! As an active duty service member, this gives me some incite to the National Guard and what they do compared to the Active Duty force. I can also say, these guys give up just as much if not more. I can also say its heartbreaking to stand in that line and salute the hearse driving by....but at the same time, it makes me proud to see so much respect given to the ones that have sacrificed everything for our country! Never Forgotten.",1503705600,,490,4.279569892473118

2710738,5,B000LAZQGW,"Being a Vietnam Vet I can appreciate what these soldiers went through. I was in the Marines and never really did understand how much the National Guard did in our wars. Now I got a lesson. When they only practice 39 days out of the year, I definitely SALUTE  them. This movie did punch me in the heart. It's worth watching.",1501718400,2,323,4.295081967213115

This was actual footage, and I am beyond appreciation for our men and women in the Military, particularly our men and women in the combat zones. My heart and prayers go to all the families that lost their husbands, wives, children and loved ones that were killed in the line of duty. I had tears streaming. And the Patriot Guards are wonderful !",1500249600,,407,4.513513513513513
2710742,4,B000LAZQGW,"I love to watch War Movies/Documentaries. I like to get the perspective of a soldier. Usually in War Movies everything is heightened. It doesn't show the pain the soldiers are facing. Pain of leaving their home, watching a fellow brother die, exhaustion, getting shot & sometimes no help. This documentary showed all of that. It didn't romantize war. It reminds me of a toned down version of the documentary ""Korengal."" I highly recommend that one as well.

The National Guard has to do well as a civilian & a soldier. That's so hard.

If you are a civilian you definitely should watch this video to understand what our soldiers do.",1498867200,,632,4.736363636363636

2710753,5,B000LAZQGW,"This is amazing. If you can get through this entire documentary without crying and getting really angry, you need to re-evaluate your life.

It's hard to watch at times because it's real. There are scenes that would be fun and entertaining if they were on a Hollywood sound stage. But since they are really from the Afghanistan mountains with real people it's emotionally difficult to watch at times. The cutaway scenes with current day interviews with the soldiers add depth to the emotional element of the film.

As far as quality, it's impressive that this is mostly filmed on body cameras. The resolution is amazing considering that. It gives the film a 'Call of Duty' game feel, which can be hard to watch as it's a lot of jumping around, but it works. It puts you in the story viewing through the soldiers' eyes. It makes the whole thing more real.",1495670400,7,854,4.6490066225165565
2710754,5,B000LAZQGW,"This is real and these are real guys fighting and digging in ... some making the ultimate sacrifice and their brothers in arms grieving afterwards.

2710756,5,B000LAZQGW,"""Citizen Soldier"" is a superb military documentary drama, which depicts the combat experience of a group of soldiers in the 45th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma Army National Guard. It takes place in one of the most dangerous regions of Afghanistan, at the height of the surge. The filming of ""Citizen Soldier"" was largely done by two female combat correspondents using helmet cameras, and it delivers a riveting first-person account of the action. This filming technique provides the viewer with a truly immersive experience, and the sense that they are actually embedded with these Army soldiers. ""Citizen Soldier"" is a totally gripping and captivating account of the tremendous skill, dedication, and sacrifice demonstrated by these courageous soldiers, who leave their mainstream civilian jobs, in order to serve their country in combat missions in the rugged and treacherous mountains of Afghanistan. It definitely conveys to its viewers a greater understanding of the structure and the role of the National Guard, as well as renewed respect and appreciation for their unwavering service and patriotism. ""Citizen Soldier"" is an absolutely outstanding military documentary drama, which merits a five-star rating, along with a very strong recommendation.",1495324800,4,1258,5.557291666666667

Thank you for your sacrifice as a Citizen Soldier that it takes a lot of patriotism to serve as these men who receive less training than what we did as active duty enlisted.

You rarely get a super clear picture of what's going on (I kept thinking ""WHAT ridge is he talking about?"", ""WHICH outcropping of rocks is that?"") but in the end it doesn't much matter. We see what they're going through.  More importantly we FEEL what they're going through. By the end of the film, we feel like they were OUR LT and OUR SGT that were lost, too.
