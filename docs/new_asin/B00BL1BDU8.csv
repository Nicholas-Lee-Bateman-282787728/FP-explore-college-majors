8570056,5,B00BL1BDU8,"Great writing, acting, period authentic props and sets, etc. Right up there with the Soprano's, different, but just as good! Instantly a video library favorite and star. I have to really love a series or movie to buy the DVD for the shelf. This is one of those times! I was in the middle of Season 2, when I bought Season's 1-4. I didn't even flinch at the cost, I just knew this compilation had to be part of my physical DVD library. It did not disappoint from Season 1 through Season 4. Some very memorable characters, lines, scenes, etc. in this rock and roll account of 1920's Atlantic City and Surroundings. I highly recommend this collection for any gangster/Sopranos/drama fan in your world.",1413590400,4,698,4.637096774193548
