8756197,5,B01DKTCASW,"This is the film that philosopher Ayn Rand criticized as communist propaganda and testified before the House on Unamerican Activities Committee.  Actually it is a beautiful film with one of the most beautiful women ever to grace Hollywood, Susan Peters, formerly Suzanne Carnahan.

I always said that if the film was art and not a documentary is was okay to portray Russia in a favorable light.  It was about love, music, war, etc. and not claimed to be a political statement.

Yes, Susan Peters died way too young at age 31 on October 23, 1952, reportedly from complications of the spinal cord injury by accidental gunshot (January 1, 1945)

Susan had been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in 'Random Harvest', a most moving film with Ronald Colman and the very talented Greer Garson.

She was absolutely gorgeous and I admire her for trying to resume her acting career after the accident, but he pain pills, etc. eventually took their toll. A real tragedy, not because she was a movie star, but because so much of her life ahead was cut short.",1522281600,3,1084,4.73936170212766
