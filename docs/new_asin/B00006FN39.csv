1751073,4,B00006FN39,"Two showbiz couples Kay, Eric, Brooke, & David arrive via plane {with a 'questionable' pilot} on a deserted island for a ""vacation"", yet there is no outside communication thereon, and no transportation off the isle for at least two weeks, plus they have to walk a mile to their destination {not so bad, but for an erstwhile 'vacation'?}, which from the outside, appears to be an abandoned beach house, sort of haunted looking, not too bad, and with a rustic charm - but upon entering, is actually quite accommodating, with a generous supply of amenities, including a nice selection of liquor, food, and cigarettes.

Kay is a surrealist artist who has been haunted by nightmares for years, in a seemingly precognitive, almost oneiromantic succession of incidents manifesting and realized by deja vu, yet no one believes her warnings or sensations of dread. She even had painted a couple of locations there, but to no avail. One by one her friends meet with a grisly demise, from impalement to a hanging decapitation, to a hooking and drowning. A random fisherman eviscerating fish on the beach gets his skull split by an oar.

Amidst a raging storm, finally finding herself alone, it turns into a latch-ditch effort of survival as the horror in her dream comes to life like a 'tulpa' {thought-form} that ultimately fulfills her terror. Quite an impressive materialization indeed. ",1385164800,7,1379,4.98695652173913
1751074,5,B00006FN39,"I was really hesitant to buy this title, because of the negative reviews here on amazon. I decided to buy and decide for myself if the print quality was sufficient. I have a Yamaha dvd player and a Samsung led television and I did not find any flaw on this release. I found the white stripes on the print charming, a reminder that the medium used to be a film. So my advice is do not hesitate just go right ahead and buy if you are interested.",1321747200,4,443,4.103448275862069
1751075,5,B00006FN39,"I agree with the previous reviewer: over 530.00 for a new VHS tape?

Like so many others this is, or was, available as a PAL release. I taped it off of a cable channel about 15 or so years ago. I would like to have a DVD and when someone finally does do it I'll gladly pay fifteen or twenty dollars if it is remastered and widescreen.

The movie tells the story of a young woman tormented by nightmares regarding a beach house on an island, apparently from the time she was a child. Now married and an artist, she and her husband take a vacation with another couple to a large beach house on a lonely island.

The woman claims to have seen it in her dreams often and becomes very uneasy. Her husband, tired of her complaints, shrugs off her fears. Very bad move.

Before long the deaths begin occurring, each more grisly than the last until she is left alone to face the creature from her worse
nightmares: the Slayer!

The film has a very nasty twist at the end, one that's been used too often since then but it seems original here after all that precedes it. The kind of finish which makes you throw up your hands and say ""What's the use?"", then go out and play in traffic.

There is cause to hope.

Another of my favorites, KEEP MY GRAVE OPEN, has finally made DVD but under another title. I plan on picking up a new copy within the next few months.

But this fool offering a 'new' tape for what he wants is sadly in need of a reality check.",1258848000,,1444,4.187725631768953

1751097,4,B00006FN39,"Ive noted before that the eighties were a high time for low budget horror films, equaled only by the ton of horror movies released to the drive-in market of the early sixties. But with the drive-ins in decline the outlet that took advantage of this were the mom and pop video stores across the country. In need of product for their shelves all sorts of movies were being made and horror was one of the main staples. Some were good and some were bad but most landed somewhere in between. THE SLAYER falls into this category but leans to better than expected.

Kay (Sarah Kendall) is an artist plagued by terrifying images in her sleep. In an effort to relieve the stress of an upcoming gallery showing her husband David (Alan McRae), brother Eric (Frederick Flynn) and sister in law Brooke (Carol Kottenbrook) have arranged a short vacation. The location is a secluded island owned by one of Erics friends. Its the off season and no one else is on the island. With the pantry and fridge stocked, the four set off for a quiet time away from phones and worries.

But once they hit the island the fears Kay has had come up again. Various items on the island are scenes she has painted in recent months, even though shes never been to this island. The rest of the group tells her shes imagining things and they find the house and settle in. Then things begin to happen. Eventually the members of this group begin to be killed one by one. Is someone else on the island, perhaps the pilot who brought them there? Or maybe someone else, someone who has been stalking Kay? Then again maybe it is the terrifying creature she only catches glimpses of in her dreams.

The movie is well made and for a group of actors who were basically unknowns they to a good job here. Kendall is particularly good with a haunted look to her that makes the character of Kay, a woman who is afraid of sleep for fear of her dreams, quite believable. Of the four main actors Kottenbrook comes off as the most skilled and her shift from perturbed at their vacation location to concern for her sister in law is well played.

What makes the movie work most of all though is the way its plotted out. We don't take too much time in exposition setting up the story but it does give us enough background to inform us. The pacing works well here too without providing an immediate murder to keep us watching but playing out the suspense enough to make us ponder whether or not Kay is insane or being pursued by a potentially supernatural force.

Of course the first thing horror fans will note is her fear of sleeping. Some might think that this makes the film a rip off of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET films. But check the date of release and youll find that this movie predates the first film of that series by 2 years.

Arrow Video does their usual bang up job here offering a restoration of the film from 4k scan of the original negative. Extras are fairly limited but include new interviews with the cast and crew, the original theatrical trailer, a reversible sleeve with artwork by Justin Osbourn and a booklet featuring new liner notes by writer Lee Gambin for those who pick up the first printing of the disc.

A few companies have seen the success that Arrow Video has had by reclaiming these lost video store gems and are trying to compete with them now. But no one has equaled the amount of affection that Arrow has for these titles. Until they do Arrow will be the company to look for when choosing movies from this category and time period.",1503878400,2,3514,4.447204968944099

1751099,3,B00006FN39,"Difficult to categorize and even harder to see since its release in 1982, The Slayer is a psychological slasher film with a pre-Nightmare on Elm Street killer that stalks its victims' dreams.  Director J.S. Cardone doesn't do as much with the concept as Wes Craven managed to a few years later, but his approach is just different enough to make this one a square peg in the round hole of '80s horror.

Kay (Sarah Kendall) is an artist whose recent abstract work is caused by a series of nightmares that have kept her mentally and emotionally on edge.  Her husband, David (Alan McRae) suggests tagging along on a trip with her brother and his wife to an isolated island retreat.  But their arrival only makes Kay more uneasy as their vacation home seems eerily similar to the landscape of her dreams.

Sure enough, David and the others are soon in danger from an unseen force that roams the island, sealing their fate in exactly the same manner Kay predicted.  Their survival, and her own, depends on her staying awake to prevent her nightmare from becoming a hellish reality!

Citing Val Lewton as a major influence, Cardone certainly adopts the same patient approach to crafting his story.  With only a few characters to kill off, the body count is considerably lower than most slashers from the era and avoids the usual POV clichs.  In fact, other than a few very brief set piece gore effects (including a subtle but effective pitchforking), The Slayer is focused more on mood than mutilation.  And its ace in the hole is the shooting location - Tybee Island, Georgia - captured during a windy and desolate looking off-season.  With drifting sand and cold, inhospitable waves trapping our troubled foursome, there's more than a hint of Lewton's I Walked with a Zombie or Isle of the Dead.

But the actors struggle to fill their roles with anything more than amateurish enthusiasm.  Lead actress Sarah Kendall (in her only role besides a stewardess in Karate Kid 2) fits the part of a haunted artist, with sunken eyes and a distracted stare.  The others disappear into an uninteresting background of worrisome nagging and bad decisions.  And despite his attempts to keep things classy, Cardone more often than not falls back on endless scenes of people creeping through the dark calling out various names.  The Slayer is compulsively watchable, if only for its relative obscurity, but is still weighted down by the usual flaws inherent in the genre...even if the filmmakers themselves won't admit it.

Arrow Films new Blu-delivers a beauty of a Blu-ray on every level, from the superb transfer (a 4K scan from the original negative) to an enormously entertaining slate of extras.  There are three commentary tracks to choose from: one from Cardone and company, another with The Hysteria Continues horror podcast, and finally a 60-minute of so conversation with composer Robert Folk followed by musical selections.  And anything not covered there is certainly brought up in the hour-long documentary Nightmare Island:  The Making of the Slayer.  A tour of the original Tybee Island locations, footage from a recent Tybee Island screening, Q & A and audience ""reaction track"" that allows you to experience the film with a live audience complete the package.",1503273600,,3256,4.926739926739927
1751100,4,B00006FN39,"I own this one on dvd and used to watch it on vhs .it's not a bad little horror movie but I feel it could have been so much better as you only see the demon on the cover art in one scene at the very end.  This Arrow release of The Slayer has not yet been  released but it will be no doubt an awesome  4k transfer ,region free for all blu ray players",1499385600,2,349,3.6266666666666665
1751101,2,B00006FN39,"Mostly dull horror film was marketed as if it was a slasher film when it came out on VHS back in the early 1980's.  It isn't.  Artist Kay suffers from recurring nightmares and reluctantly agrees to go on a vacation to a house on an extremely remote island for a week with her husband, her brother and her sister in law.  She's sullen and mopey and says the place makes her flesh crawl, which doesn't exactly make her the life of the party as far as the others are concerned.

When Kay is sleeping on the beach a fisherman is killed.  Later while she is sleeping her husband investigates noises in the house which eventually lead him to the basement and a gory death that is so poorly staged it's hard to figure out exactly how he manages to get killed the way that he does.  Kay knows about the death as soon as she wakes up because she dreamt it.  Not only that but she's convinced that something that comes alive when she dreams killed her husband and also that it killed a kitten she was given when she was a little girl.  Why it waited so long to kill again after the kitten incident the movie never makes any attempt to explain.

While the idea isn't bad the filmmakers don't know what to do with it.  Eventually, we see what it is that is killing people but it takes way too long for that to happen.  Incubus (also 1982) employed a similar idea but the link between the young man's nightmares and the real life murders was clear.  In The Slayer the filmmakers just have Kay wake up and say she dreamt the murder we saw--in other words, the filmmakers actually have no idea how to visualize their concept.  We never see Kay actually dreaming any of the things that happen and the stuff we do actually see from her dreams doesn't actually happen, so basically The Slayer is a confused mess that seems to have been made by people who have no idea how to tell a story or film a decent murder.

The Slayer squanders a pretty good idea and potentially creepy setting, rarely delivering the goods in terms of gore, horror or suspense.  Even the twist ending feels like a potentially good idea that the filmmakers didn't quite know how to pull off.  It isn't hard to see why lead actress Sarah Kendall never starred in another film.  She makes for an almost strikingly unappealing heroine and is pretty much impossible to root for or care about.  Presumably, somebody likes this movie since it was released on Blu-ray but I can't really think of a good reason to sit through it.",1498608000,,2476,4.392543859649122

7968039,4,B00006FN39,"Struggling artist Kay (Sarah Kendall), her husband (Frederick Flynn) and another couple (Carol Kottenbrook and Alan McRae), take an impromptu vacation to a remote island to get away from it all. Unfortunately for them, the terrible dreams that have haunted Kay since girlhood have followed her to the island. While Kay slumbers, one by one, her beloved and her friends are slowly and gruesomely picked off. Is it Kay's subconscious or is it... ""The Slayer""?

Released in 1982, a time where you couldn't throw a cat (or a hammer?) without hitting a slasher film, ""The Slayer"" is in good company, but also stands out from the pack in a few ways. First off, unlike your ""Prom Night"" or ""My Bloody Valentine,"" this film isn't about teens getting cut up. This is a movie about adults, and despite some dodgy acting here and there, these characters feel like a real, tight-knit group of people who care about each other, which makes their grisly fates even more effective. Also, this isn't exactly a body count flick. With only four characters (well, there's also the pilot who pops in and out of the plot), that pretty much goes without saying. As a result, ""The Slayer"" is slow and steady, and focuses on the surreal more than it does in grossing you out.

On the technical side of things, the haunting, desolated beach-side setting and the gorgeous cinematography help to keep things interesting during the movie's slower parts. Also of note are the special effects which, while few and far between, are pretty well accomplished for such a small-budget affair. They couldn't get Tom Savini, but Robert Babb does his best to keep you (ahem) hooked. Likewise, the score that serves as the backdrop to the horror adds a touch of class rarely associated with the genre.

There's a lot going on in this deceptively simple little film. Much like, say, ""Phantasm,"" it plays with your expectations and makes you question that what you've seen was real (or at least real in the context of the film). If you watch it late at night, it will beg another viewing in the morning just to make sure you got everything. It's that kind of movie. For its modest intentions and humble origins, ""The Slayer"" pretty much slays. Fans of the genre who have patience for the more deliberately paced side of things won't want to sleep on this.

After years of being abused and neglected, the good folks at Arrow have assembled the definitive home video release of ""The Slayer."" Previously out of print and only appearing in heavily truncated and poorly transferred form, fans get both a DVD and Blu-Ray copy (because, even if you're still using DVD, you deserve to see this film). The print is absolutely pristine and the soundtrack is mixed just right, meaning you won't have to keep fiddling with the volume control as the film jumps from screams and stings to hushed dialogue. The special features are also plentiful, the centerpiece of which is an hour long retrospective documentary that focuses a lot on the film's scrappy beginnings, its troubled release and its gnarly special-effects. Be sure to pick this up if you're a fan of this sort of thing.",1504915200,12,3127,4.7744916820702406

Still the few kill scenes look great, and I liked the weird supernatural dream storyline.  I'd recommend to fans of obscure early 1980s Slashers.

7968042,3,B00006FN39,"The Slayer is a slasher film made in 1982. Kay (Sarah Kendall), an artist who favors surrealism, decides to go on vacation with her brother Eric (Frederick Flynn) and their two friends David (Alan McRae) and Brooke (Carol Kottenbrook). But the peace is short-lived. As a storm batters the island, troubled artist Kay begins to sense that a malevolent presence is present with them, stalking them at every turn. Is she losing her mind, or are her childhood nightmares of a demonic assailant coming to terrifying life?

Sensing she has been on the island before, but not sure when of how, Kay witnesses many graphic murders. Shes so terrified of these nightmares, she attempts to fight off sleep.

The heyday of the slasher flick was the 1980s. The trend was started by three low-budget films  Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street  that became huge hits and prompted a decades worth of horror movies that followed a familiar formula: establish a creepy location, introduce a horrifying presence bent on murder, usually with sharp, nasty instruments, and knock off characters periodically until a final confrontation between the monster and survivor(s).

The Slayer follows this template. The theme of reality and nightmare blending into one another is intriguing, and predated A Nightmare on Elm Street, which used the theme and introduced iconic horror monster Freddy Krueger two years later.

Because so many slasher movies were made around the same time, they tended to rip each other off, while trying to up the intensity and variety of murders. There aren't as many killings in The Slayer as in most slasher pictures, but director J.S. Cordon does create a creepy atmosphere and builds considerable suspense.

The 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD release features a brand new restoration from a 4K scan of the original camera negative. Bonus materials on the unrated, widescreen 2-disc set include brand new interviews with cast and crew, original theatrical trailer, reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork, and collectors booklet with new liner notes.",1504051200,11,2093,5.174556213017752
7968043,5,B00006FN39,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's flawed, certainly, but for a low-budget production, a spectacular job was achieved.

Aside from a desolate filming location, dreary atmosphere, and a good deal of tension derived from its limited cast, what the movie does really well is it sticks to its tagline: ""Is it a nightmare, or is it The Slayer?"" Throughout the film, it's not uncommon for this question to arise from time to time; after all, when the ""slayer"" of these fussy people does its work, it is either not seen or else is seen only in a shadowed glimpse. Who is making these nightmares come true? Are they even coming true, or are they all part of some vivid imagination? Hints of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREEET are here, albeit not fully fleshed out, due likely to a limited budget or else because the movie wants to go the minimalist route. It does end on a note which left me considering different possibilities about its concept and overall story. Some viewers don't like that, but I love works of art--such as this one--that allow the viewer (or reader) to use his or her own imagination.

THE SLAYER, while a bit slowly paced for some (younger viewers, especially) and lacking a tad in the storytelling department, is actually a pleasant, suspenseful, wonderfully dread-drenched, tense, nicely layered, occasionally gory horror film (it holds back on the exploitation, thankfully, yet when it does show gore, it shows just enough to keep us satisfied). It's one of the better horror obscurities you'll see.",1503964800,,1522,4.827586206896552
