5071686,1,B007AFS0PK,"I specifically bought this movie for the ""Live a Little...."" feature, but was disappointed by that movie's inability to rekindle any fond memories I thought I had of it. The story was more the bio background of Murf the Surf, played by Don Stroud. The actual heist was a flat balloon with very little suspense or well-timed planning that most heist movies employ. They both got caught and served time, with only the most well-known and valuable stolen gem recovered. As for the other feature, I turned that yawner of in the first 10 minutes. Don't waste your time on either.",1388966400,,574,4.693069306930693
5071687,4,B007AFS0PK,"La qualit de l'image n'est pas trs bonne surtout sur le film sudden death (image un peu trop sombre). Sinon, il est dommage qu'il n'y a pas de version sous titr ou de version franaise mme si je le savais en l'achetant.",1369958400,3,218,4.214285714285714
8513297,4,B007AFS0PK,"Absolutely dreadful, but in a funny, Robert Conrad kind of way.  Conrad apparently left his old fight crew from the Wild Wild West behind on this movie and it shows.  Great stuff for camppy 1970s entertainment.",1525996800,,210,4.805555555555555

8513306,5,B007AFS0PK,"Two rough & tough Robert Conrad features.  Listen to Robert Conrad utter the F-word in this foreign made revenge thriller that slings blood around as much as it does bullets.  The finale between Conrad and Don Stroud is something else!  ""Live a Little, Steal A Lot"" was a fun crime caper epic based on a true-life event.  The boat chase is spectacular!",1404864000,3,352,4.629032258064516
