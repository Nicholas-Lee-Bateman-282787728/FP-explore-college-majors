2306887,5,B0009OL84E,I bought this last year in Japanese with subtitles and though some things didn't translate well i still loved this movie. I've been waiting and waiting for it to come out in english! For Inuyasha fans this is one of the best things you'll see. It deserves 10 stars!!,1121299200,6,266,4.448979591836735
2306888,5,B0009OL84E,"this is the best out of all three movies and those who know InuYasha know also that this is a GOOD thing...the episodes are good but this movie tops it off quite nicely. Great plot, characters, fight scenes, ending, you name it.",1119225600,,228,4.4523809523809526
2306889,5,B0009OL84E,"Finally Amazon list the 3rd Inuyasha movie. This one has Inuyasha and Sesshomaru fight each other at least until a villion name Sounga steps which is a much bigger picture. September 6 is way too long for this movie to come out.

This movie has more blood then the first two movies it makes them look like disney movies. Kikyo is not in this movie at all. A new character named Siya who protected the evil sword for 200 years instead of 700.

The drawings and the animation looks so mature like real anime manga.",1117843200,2,512,4.378947368421053
2306890,5,B0009OL84E,"I saw this movie in Japanese with English subtitles, and if you're a true Inu Yasha fan, it will blow you AWAY! This movie gives you everything you could possibly want from  our favorite half demon, his suave youkai brother, and the rest of the Inuyasha gang. It has a big movie feel to it and is more than just an extended episode.  After the disappointment of the second movie, I was really hoping to see something great and I was not disappointed. BUY IT! It's on order, but already on my wishlist!",1117497600,5,501,4.376344086021505

Than you fast forward to Kagome's time and Inu-Yasha going to see her at school. On their way home to Kagome's house they see the 3rd sword of fang. Something horribal happends . Anyway Kagome and the others have to stop Inu-Yasha and the sword from distroying the world. You really need to get this DVD. It's such a great moive.,1116374400,8,494,4.5

2306898,5,B0009OL84E,"If you are a fan of the TV series, then you'll enjoy the movie.  As of now (Jan 2016) there are 4 movies that I know of.  This is the 3rd movie.  This is also my favorite movie out of the bunch.

This movie has a storyline all on its own so you can watch it anytime you want.  There is no specific place to view this if watching the TV series.  I usually watch it after season 4.  Seems to be a good spot as any.  You will have to know what happened at the grave of Inuyasha's father (season 1) and how Sesshormau lost his arm.

There are a few things that fans enjoy with this movie.  First, you see Inuyasha crying after his mother gives birth to him.  That's right!  Inuyasha came into this world crying.  Second, you get to see the father of Inuyasha and Sesshormaru in both forms:  Human and DogDemon.  Third, Inuyasha looses his beads of subjugation.  So no more ""sit"" commands from Kagome.  Fourth, Sesshormaru wields Tetsusagia - for a split second.  Fifth, Jaken joins team Inuyasha while the brothers (Inuyasha and Sesshormaru) are off doing solo stuff.  Sixth, you learn Inuyasha's age...200 years old.

So if you enjoy the TV series give this movie a try.  There is no Naraku, Koga, or Kikyo, but you get a lot of Sesshomaru!",1451952000,,1237,4.337719298245614

I don't love, however, the way that the Instant Video version apparently only allows you to watch the dub, even though it specifically lists the Japanese voice actors in the information! Started watching and was quickly greeted with English, all English, only English.... So. A word of warning to you. If you are picky about language, don't waste your time with the Instant Video edition.

2306939,5,B0009OL84E,"I think this has been my favorite of all the movies. This is the last one I purchased as I hadn't seen any of them before I bought them, and I missed this one's release. I think I like it best because it shows Inuyasha recognizing his greater strength from being partly human. It is an awesome movie and I highly recommend it to any Inuyasha series lover like me.",1392595200,,363,4.2

The action is awesome and my favorite one of all four movies. of course i love the second one for a certain scene, that takes ages to happen in the anime. a must buy/watch!

2306949,5,B0009OL84E,"Many years ago, the Great Dog Demon wileded 3 powerful swords. Upon his death, he left 2 of them to his sons, Inuyasha and Sesshomaru. The 3rd and most dangerous sword, Sounga, was hidden forever. At least that was the intention. The Sounga's power has been awakened, and Inuyasha & Sesshomaru must join together and fight against the sword that will destroy the world.

This is my favorite Inuyasha movie. I love a story from the past. This movie gives some interesting insight into the feelings of Sesshomaru toward his father, and the character of the Great Dog Demon. This is what I like most about the movie. The animation, characters, and soundtrack are excellent. It is presentd in 5.1 Dolby Digital audio and runs 100 minutes long. This is a must have for Inuyasha fans.",1353456000,,778,4.720588235294118
2306950,3,B0009OL84E,"The DVD was in new condition, but upon removal of the shrink wrap, i noticed the plastic sleeve over the cover art was damaged. It looked to be stretched too tight over the DVD case, and it warped. It went as far as to bend in the case a little. This doesn't seem to be something that can be blamed on the shipping process.

I know it is a minor issue, and it doesn't affect the playability of the DVD, but when i bite the budget bullet and order a ""new"" DVD I wish to recieve it in ""new"" quality.",1350864000,,497,3.97
2306951,5,B0009OL84E,"Inyuyasha has always been a great series and I try to follow it. I reccomend the videos. It may. Just be me, but sometimes 30 minute episodes need you wantiing to feel more. Whether it be Inyuyasha's toughness, or the interactions with Kagoma. The movies give you that oppurtunity.",1322956800,,281,4.755102040816326
2306952,5,B0009OL84E,"I love Swords of an Honorable Ruler.  It gives the back story of Inuyasha's birth and you get to see what his father is like.  I first checked out the DVD from my local library and I fell in love with it.  I love Inuyasha anyway and enjoyed seeing how he came into the world.  It kept me on the edge of my seat watching Inuyasha fight the power of the sword's evil that was trying to take control of him.  It was even better when he had to join forces with his brother to defeat the sword and it's demonic powers.  I had to have the movie and purchased it as soon as I was able.  It was well worth the price and it was money well spent.  If you love or even like Inuyasha, you'll enjoy this DVD.",1302566400,,695,3.914285714285714
2306953,3,B0009OL84E,"Swords of an Honorable Ruler is the third of four films in the Inuyasha franchise.  During the course of the film, Inuyasha and his brother, Sesshomaru (who hate each other), must team up together in order to defeat the enemy.  But can these feuding brothers put aside their rivalry long enough to save the day?

There are seven special features on the DVD.  The first is a Line Art Gallery, which is split into two sections: Characters and Settings.  There are forty pages of character model sheets under the ""Characters"" section.  The ""Settings"" section contains thirty-two pages of settings.

The ""Special Footage"" link is next, and it takes you to a feature that runs a little over twenty-six minutes.  This footage recaps some of the important moments in the series that tie in to Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's rivalry.

Next, there are the Japanese trailers for Swords of an Honorable Ruler, with a trailer for the fourth Inuyasha film included at the end.  These run for about five minutes, but they are all in Japanese with no English subtitles.  There are also Viz Media trailers, a one screen ad for the Inuyasha graphic novels, a one screen ad for the Inuyasha trading card game, and a preview for the Inuyasha Feudal Combat video game (which looks a lot like Inuyasha characters are put into a game that is played in the same manner as the Street Fighter games).

Overall, Swords of an Honorable Ruler is an excellent film.  The runtime for the film is perfect for the story being told.  This DVD should be in the collection of anyone who appreciates the Inuyasha anime series.",1246320000,,1585,4.737226277372263
2306954,5,B0009OL84E,"This is the best of the Inuyasha movies.  I just wished they had shown more about the father.  Sesshoumaru at the beginning of the movie says he has no need of anybody to protect.  He never notices he slowly gathers his folowers(Rin and Jaken) whom he protects for whatever reason.  Inuyasha has followers, too. The two sons are just like their father, though neither would ever admit it.
  If you are unfamiliar with Inuyasha  start with the first movie, which recaps the origin story.",1209686400,,486,4.714285714285714
2306955,5,B0009OL84E,"It's good if you like InuYasha. There is a small plot hole in the way that Inu-Papa dies, but over all it's a good movie. It shows that Sesshoumaru is starting to have a Grinch moment and his heart is starting to grow. I liked it so much that I went out and bought all the movies in box set.",1206576000,,291,3.8666666666666667
2306956,5,B0009OL84E,This was the most action packed movie out of all four if you ask me. If you are a fan of inuyasha himself you get the special treat of seeing him as a newborn in the beginning of the movie along with his mother and father.,1194134400,,222,3.847826086956522
2306957,5,B0009OL84E,This is one of my favorite Inuyasha. I love the storyline behind it. The three powerful swords. Highly recommended.,1190764800,,115,5.105263157894737

2306959,5,B0009OL84E,"If you are not hooked on Inuyasha yet, you're in for a big surprise. The key is to start watching it from the very beginning, because, like some soft of soap opera, it is building up on each movie, everything is a key to a puzzle. We have a whole Inuyasha library and it's just such a sweet, unusual, and dark story. Highly recommended!",1180742400,,336,4.265625
2306960,4,B0009OL84E,"Out of all 4 of the Inuyasha movies, this is the last one i've seen. I'd been told that this movie was the best of the bunch. After purchsing it I was not dissapointed at all. As far as the four movies go, this is one of the best, although my preference still puts Movie 2: Castle behind the looking glass out on top. But this movie has top-notch animation, a pure evil brilliantly played villain and it always keeps you on the edge of your seat.

I have always been a large fan of Inuyasha. Its one of my favourite anime's of all time. But i myself was disappointed with movie 1. This movie is top notch compared to it though. The first thing to mention is that Sesshomaru, one of the greatest Inuyasha characters finally takes a large role in the movie, unlike taking bit parts in the previous two. This is because the movie revolves around the 3 swords of the fang that Inuyasha's father created, and the battle for Inuyasha and Sesshomaru to destroy the Sounga, the Sword of Hell and the 3rd sword of their fathers. This also leads to a lot of detail of the back-story of Inuyasha'a birth and the love of his parents, a plot that i have been wanting to see for a very long time.

The film is also presented in a graphically beautiful and impressive style. Whether its the villains hideout or the passgeway to hells grim, foreboding look, or the quaint peacefull look of the modern era, the lighting and deep coloured visuals helped portray the correct settings and moods during the movie. The action itself never lets up, it feels brilliantly paced through one fight scene, to another and the plot interwoven nicely in between.

However, every silver lining has a cloud, and not all is perfect, but most is. The music is mainly well created and orchestrated, however vocal tracks like the ending songs are subpar compared to other Inuyasha songs. The voice acting for the dub is also of high quality for the key chacters, however if you get down to some of the secondary roles, such as the spirit of Sounga's sheath and Kagomes schoolfriends, the voices can make you want scratch your ears off.

Also if you're a fan of other character plots, such as Sango and Miroku, there is nothing here for you. This movie (and its not a problem) focuses on the dog demons and how they must work together to overcome the Sounga. But this movie does give Miroku, Sango and Shippo backseat roles primarily used in lengthening the fight scenes, although Miroku does have a touching moment of near sacrifice for Sango's sake.

If I had to choose a favourite between movies 2 and 3, i'd still go with movie 2, but this one is close to perfect that if you are an Inuyasha fan who does not own this, you are missing out on a classic pice of Japanimation. Rectify this immediately people! This movie, overall is too good to miss",1176336000,,2812,4.473684210526316
2306961,5,B0009OL84E,"You get history on InuYasha's mom and dad w/this one which is nice. Also you get info on the swords including some team work in the family of the dog demons. English available but you should watch it with the subtitles because there is some minor differences. Great story starts with the death of daddy dog demon and the resurrection of the man who killed him,kinda. In Kagome's world the sword is unleashed and havoc breaks out. InuYasha must take the sword into the past through the well to save the future. Only problem is the sword has a mind of it's own and wants to kill'kill'kill. Kagome saves her man and the sword finds a new host and the fight is on! Sesshemoru must team up with his brother or everyone will be sucked into hell! All I have to say is BUY IT NOW, DO NOT PASS GO, DO PASS THROUGH YOUR AMAZON CHECKOUT! Even if your not a fan yet you should like this one. If you are a fan, why are you wasting your time reading my review? BUY THE DAMN MOVIE!",1175040000,,966,4.198924731182796
2306962,5,B0009OL84E,"I saw InuYasha The Movie 3 on Cartoon Network. So I got a copy on the movie. The DVD comes with special features. When the Great Dog Demon died,  he left 3 swords behind. One when to  InuYasha and the other one to Sesshomaru. The third sword was locked away forever. Now the third sword this back.

2306963,5,B0009OL84E,"Inuyasha is a great anime.  It has 4 movies.  I have yet to see the fourth movie, but of the first 3, this is my favorite and it will be tough to beat.  The third movie focuses on Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's relationship, or lack there of, with their father and his swords which he handed down to them.

This movie explains how Inuyasha's father met his end and reveals a secret.  Inuyasha's father had 3 swords.  He gave the sword of heaven which can save 100 lives with one swing to his older son, Sesshomaru.  This sword is called the Tenseiga.  He gave the sword of earth which can be used to vanquish 100 foes in one swing and in  doing so defend mankind to his younger son, Inuyasha.  This sword is called Tetsusaiga. His last sword was the sword of hell and was capable of plunging the entire earth into hell.  This sword was called the Sounga.

Inuyasha's father banished the sword Sounga after his death, but in Kagome's time the sword was released from its seal.  Now Inuyasha and Sesshomaru must stop the rampaging Sounga before it carries out its mission and destroys all mankind.  Only by using both the Backlash Wave, Tetsusaiga's Ultimate technique and the Dragon Strike, Sesshomaru's technique which he can use with the Tenseiga together can the Sounga be destroyed, but can these two siblings work together long enough to discover victory?

This movie is wonderful in that it explains much of Sesshomaru's past and why he does the things he does.  Sesshomaru's development in this movie is wonderful and all the other characters are not to be missed.  The show may be called Inuyasha, but in my opinion Sesshomaru steals the show in the wonderful movie!",1153872000,4,1668,4.638225255972697
2306964,3,B0009OL84E,"In addition to possessing the two swords Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga, which now belong to Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, their father also possessed a demon possessed sword of great power called Sounga. It was put under seal by a guardian demon and thrown into the same well that Kagome uses to time travel back to the feudal age. But after 700 years the seal has worn away and the sword seeks out the most powerful demon in the vicinity, which just happens to be Inuyasha who was visiting Kagome in the present. Since he is only a half-demon, he does not have the power to wield the sentient sword, which gains partial control of his actions. Inuyasha is able to make it back to his time, but cannot keep the sword from making him attack his friends. He's at a loss as to how to free himself from the sword but Sesshomaru has an idea! He'll take it from his dead hand! You see, Sesshomaru is pretty jealous of anything that Inuyasha possesses of their father's because he sees himself as his true son. Inuyasha is just a mistake of his dad's weakness.

Sesshomaru is one of my favorite characters on the Inuyasha tv show, so it was nice to see him play a bigger role in this movie. I thought a cool thing about this movie is that we finally get to see something about the lives of Inuyasha's parents. We already knew about his mother as she gave him unconditional love even though humans were afraid of him as a child. But we also finally get a look at his father, who seems to have the best traits of his two sons. But while the flashbacks to the origins of Inuyasha's birth was welcome, in other respects this movie seemed like an extended tv episode that went on too long and dragged a bit. We've seen the Inuyasha controlled by his demon blood plot before so it gets old fast. It's worth seeing for any Inuyasha fan for the fill-ins of the past and for Sesshomaru's epiphany of where strength comes from.",1151280000,3,1899,4.394886363636363
2306965,2,B0009OL84E,"I was just ever so excited when i saw the 3rd InuYasha dvd.. wheile i thought the story line looked a little weak, i am utterly obbsessed with inuyasha, so i thought i would give it a try... but low and behold my instincts were correct! The story line is lacking any actual substance and just from the dvd menu the bad animation can be seen. Did the same people animate this one? While i continue to be obbsessed with Inuyasha, i really do wish i hadn't waisted the money on this DVD.",1142553600,,484,4.21505376344086

2306967,5,B0009OL84E,"This was a great movie - funny. If you have watched the series then don't miss this movie as it refers to InuYasha's Father and helps you to get to know Seshomaru better as well as all the other characters. The movie is a bit different from the Series but it is definately worth watching. Hint - Inuyasha finally gets the necklace off and finally becomes free from Kagome's famous 'SIT' commands - or does he???? Find out by watching the movie, I highly recommend it as it helps explains the missing bits from the Series.",1141603200,6,521,4.4375
2306968,5,B0009OL84E,"I love this movie alot!

When I saw this movie for the 1st time I emeadiantly fell in love with Sesshomaru, and I coulden't stop thinking about him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1139616000,,262,8.357142857142858
2306969,5,B0009OL84E,This movie was very funny and action packed. I always watch the series up to today. But here I learned more why Inyasha dad was killed. Minormaru the vallian was in love with  Inuyashas mom shes human. In the movie Miroku finally told Sango how he felt about her. After all now they both like each other. Miroku is always feeling and grabbing on her butt. In the end for the first times the geat dog demon(aka:Inuyashas dad) came and spoke with him for the firt time. I cant wait for the fourth movie.,1137801600,,501,4.329787234042553
2306970,5,B0009OL84E,"So far, this is the best Inuyasha movie as far as english dubing gose. It is the second best movie over all, the fourth movie is the best. THE MOVIES ARE JUST GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.",1136764800,,185,4.166666666666667
2306971,5,B0009OL84E,"I have just recently purchased this DVD from Amazon. I have to say that this is the best Inuyasha movie that has been created and a must have for any fan of the series, as well as a grab for any person that have never heard of the series.

I couldn't wait until it was over and I could watch it over again with the japanesse dialog with subtitles. The voices sound quite different in japanesse then the English actors, making the characters younger or older. Truely a delight.",1136160000,,476,4.348314606741573
2306972,5,B0009OL84E,"When I first saw Inu-Yasha was the first movie(#1) and it sucked! It was poorly animated with bunch of stupid jokes, boring story, lame bad guys, cheap speial effects and so so fights. I also saw a little bit of the serie but it didn't catched my atention.

BUT this movie shut my mouth! It was INCREDIBLE!! the action scenes were SUPERB! The powers were big and GREAT! the animation is HIGH BUGET like Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust! the camera shots were fast and COOL! the fights were AWESOME! the movie itself is ACTION-PACKED and the best of all! the movie is more serious.

This could be the best Inu-Yasha movie because Inu-Yasha fight with his COOL brother two times, Inu-Yasha and his brother fight with millions of monsters like ONE-MEN ARMY, Inu-Yasha's friends also fight, the bad guy looks COOL, there are great dramatic scenes and the movie have a more dark setting.

The bad things are that the graphics looks the same like the serie and the previous movies, and the little scene when Inu-Yasha have something ugly and lame tied to his arm. BUT that's all!! the movie is AWESOME and it's worth buying it!!!!

ADIOS.",1133740800,,1126,4.64321608040201
2306973,5,B0009OL84E,"Thank you I love anime and Inu-Yasha and this movie is just awesome! It blows you away! I'm very picky and I can honestly say after the movie was over I said ""Very Good worth the money"" The voice acting on the Dub and Japanese is some of the best in the business. The animation is breath taking and if you like the story of Inu-Yasha at all this is a MUST buy!

A very happy anime fan! ^__^",1133740800,,390,3.9367088607594938
2306974,5,B0009OL84E,"Inuyasha Movie 3 is the best Inuyasha movie in th US so far.  It's about how Kagome's family has one of Inuyasha's father's sword, and how someone is trying to steal it.  It is a powerful sword and it's also cursed.  If you are not strong enough to fight the curse it will over whelm who ever touches it and they will kill anyong and thing in their path.  Well, Inuyasha touches the sword and starts killing people, but Kagome saves him, DUH.  Any way, an enemy of Inuyasha's father steals the sword, and Inuyasha and Sesshomaru have to work together (""Them work together. Ha-ha Hell will freeze over before that happens Ha-ha!"" -Jaken) to get the sword back.  It's awsome!",1133222400,,673,4.520661157024794
2306975,5,B0009OL84E,"I am VERRY satisfied with this product, it is the best movie out of the three Inu-Yasha movies. If you like Anime and action I highly recommend you to buy this movie. It has a great blend of comedy, action, drama... everything. The animation has great colors and amazing definition of the drawings plus really cool special effects!!!!!!!!  n.n",1129075200,,343,4.813559322033898

2306977,5,B0009OL84E,I'm a big Inuyasha fan and usually i like the romance storyline and want to see where that is going. But this movie was so action packed and fast moving I was absolutely glued to the screen the entire time! Loved it and loved seeing Sesshy play such a big part in this story line. can't wait to see with 4th movie in english!,1128816000,2,325,4.09375
2306978,5,B0009OL84E,This movie was really well drawn and has a great story.  I'm a Inu-Yasha fan and was happy that this movie answered my questions on Inu-Yasha parents and his relationship with his brother Sesshomaru.,1128816000,2,199,4.852941176470588
2306979,5,B0009OL84E,It answered alot of questions pertainig to Inuyasha's parents and Sesshomarou's feelings towards him as well. Visually beautiful and a great story line.,1128729600,,152,5.6521739130434785
2306980,5,B0009OL84E,"Well the 1st movie just sucked, the 2nd one redemed the 1st one, and the 3rd one puts both to shame. I did not figure it could be better than the 2nd which was incredible, but damn was I suprised.

However I must admit there some weak areas (when Inuyahsa's father says he has nothing left to teach him, he never did jack, others too). But of the Inuyasha movies, this one was the best.",1128643200,2,386,4.1466666666666665
2306981,5,B0009OL84E,"I would have to say the best out of four. Finally you get a little back story on the Inu-papa/Sesshomaru/Inuyasha realtionship. Although its just a glimpse, it was well recieved.

I have to say first off, that I notice alot of people saying that it didn't ""move"" the plot of the anime along or is even really related to it. Well, thats because its not. The movies are done independantly of the anime or manga, so don't expect huge plot twists or anything like that. They are just for the rabid enjoyment of us fans.

It was a nice break to see something other than Kagome/Inuyasha fluff, Naraku or the shikon no tama being concentrated on. Sesshomaru finally gets more than 2 lines and 4 (or less) minutes of screen time, and Rin gets to speak something more than ""Hai!"" or ""Sesshomaru-sama!"".

The basic plot of the story is, the sword of hell called Soun-ga is released and kind of goes on a rampage. This sword was weilded by Inu-papa before he died, along with his other two swords Tessaiga and Tenseiga.

When the sword is released it threatens to swallow up the earth into hell, and Sesshomaru and Inuyasha are on a quest to stop it (albiet seperatley). I know the official description of this movie hints that the boys ""get together"" to defeat the sword, but don't buy that. This movie stays true to character, so don't expect huggles between brothers. (Could you imagine? Inuyasha going to Sesshomaru, ""Sessho-ni chan! Fight with me, please?""...I can't. Although I would pay good money to see Sesshomarus response..... :) )

There are some awesome fight scenes in this movie, one you have to slow down to truly appreciate it (check out the Tenseiga in mouth while throwing Tokijin move, sweet move but happens really fast). Most of this movie is battle involved, but it moves smoothly and there are breaks in the fighting scenes that make it non-repetative.

The animation was well done, and the use of digital coloring really shows. Although I prefer cel to film, it does look pretty good. The sound is excellent, and to truly appreciate it Dolby 5.1 is needed. The DVD has some descent extras such as line art, promos, a montoge of scenes from the anime to give you a recap of the brothers rivalry, and previews to the 4th movie Guren no Horaijima. (Which I'm guesstimating it will be out here in late 2006 or 2007). I wish the US release came with all the goodies the Japan version does.

This movie should please both Inuyasha and Sesshomaru fans, both brothers get some equal time on screen (finally) and Sessh fans should definitley be happy to see him in all his bad-ass glory (and of course saving his girl). Enjoy!!",1127779200,,2632,4.623126338329764
2306982,5,B0009OL84E,"I love the Inu-yasha t.v series and the last two movies. I am really happy that the 3rd one goes into Inu-yasha's backround a little bit. I am also glad that they get off topic for a little while. A little change of pace is good now and again. I am an avid Inu watcher and I never miss a movie or episode. I am happy that the movie came out and I can not wait to buy it!! And I can not wait for the 4th movie to come out. ^-^

~Inu-yasha fan 4 life~",1127260800,,449,3.6770833333333335
2306983,5,B0009OL84E,"The second movie definitely provided us a bit of a change of a pace by showing how the heroes would go if they ever defeated Naraku, but this one definitely rocks the usual formula.  Starting with a flashback that goes to the night Inuyasha was born, offering a bit into the past of his father, we go to present day in the series.  A deadly sword called Sounga is awakened and starts its destruction by destroying Kagome's hometown(!).  It then possesses Inuyasha, turns him evil, and sets him on a destruction spree in the Feudal Era(double !!).  Eventually though, the sword settles on a new host... Takemaru, a deceased lord who hated Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's father, and in a nice touch of continuity allows him to wield the sword by giving him Sesshomaru's decapitated arm.  Both brothers want to destroy the sword on their own, but the only possible way is to work together.  Can Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, along with the usual gang, as well as Totosai believe it or not, actually defeat their deadliest threat yet?  The story is good and the entire film is well animated, especially the battle scenes.  The usual voice cast, for both versions, is also great as usual.  As the other two films did, there is a ""behind the series"" featurette that's told entirely in Japanese that recaps all the importants events that lead up to the film.  There's also all the theatrical trailers, as well as one for the 4th film if you watch long enough.  Inuyasha fans should definitely check this out.  Some non-fans may want to watch the first two seasons to fully get the scope of the series despite the featurette included, though.",1127088000,24,1624,4.69964664310954
2306984,4,B0009OL84E,"This installment of the series had a lot going for it.  Every scene was beautifully concieved and animated, and storyline is darker and much gorier then Inuyasha has gone before.  Keeping this in mind, the first half shows a lot of promise.  It's when Sounga gains a new host that the movie really starts to slow down.  This has been hailed as ""the"" big fight between Inuyasha and Sesshomaru.  I enjoy seeing them fight as much as the next Inuyasha fan, but we get to a point where every scene is them fighting and has very little to do with Sounga.  I understand they're trying to convey that the brothers simply will not get along, but it's 1 hour and 45 minute movie, and seeing the same thing over and over and over within that time is kind of annoying.  The same goes with the fight scene at the very end.  The Backlash Wave doesn't work once, okay, maybe that's a fluke.  It doesn't work twice, maybe you need to consider a different attack, not do it three more times and hope it works.  Inuyasha may not be the brightest thing there is, but he's not that stupid.  And the overall plot with Izayoi's spurned lover is kind of confusing toward the end.  If he didn't resent her, why did he kill her in the first place?

I'll be honest, the fact that this didn't have Naraku in it knocked this one down a peg or two in my book (however, excessive use of zombies really made up for that).  While the visuals were stunning, this one simply didn't grab me like the first and second movies did.",1126483200,10,1494,4.327338129496403
2306985,5,B0009OL84E,"This movie is just as good as the second one, if not better.",1126483200,3,60,3.6923076923076925
2306986,4,B0009OL84E,"Having seen the first 2 movies on DVD, I'm happy to report that this one is just as good, if not better then the first two; in all areas: animation, acting and story.

If the first movie was about a love that crossed the bounds of time and the second was about teamwork and something alongs those lines, then the third is about feuding brothers and them having to work together to save the world.

Everyone knows the story for the film by now; either by the earlier reviews or by various other means, so I won't reiterate it.  It works for the most part but unfortunatly doesn't truely advance the main story like say the Star Trek and most of the Gundam films do.

If it wasn't for the filler nature of the whole affair I would give it 5 big stars but as it stands, I give it 5 stars minus 1 star.",1126396800,6,798,4.129032258064516

2306989,5,B0009OL84E,"I purchased this movie as soon as it came out in best buy. I have got to say that this is by far one of the greatest movies of my collection. It starts off with Inuyasha's father talking to sesshomaru and after that things begin to heat up. It turns out that Inuyasha was to be born on that same night and his father was just wounded from battle. WIth that in mind he is still determined to go and protect his wife and son. Upon his arrival there seems to be guards preventing the great dog demon from entering so there was only one solution which was to move or die. We get to see his father use all three of his awesome swords and how each of them play an important role. Tenseiga the sword of heaven weilded by sesshomaru has to power to save 100 lives, Tetsaiga the sword of earth has the power to slay 100 enemies with a single swing, and the sounga the sword of hell which can summon 100 corpses from the gates of hell. This was overall a great story and I recommend this movie to all inuyasha fans.",1126051200,6,1005,4.106598984771574
2306990,5,B0009OL84E,"Swords of an Honrorable Ruler is the best movie out of all 4 of them. It is the first time in the entire series that you acually see InuYasha and Sesshomaru's Father ""The Great Dog Demon"". His phyisical characteristics resemble both that of InuYasha and Sesshomaru. While his personality more resembles InuYasha. The film opens up with him speaking with Sesshomaru which would be there last time. He ask Sesshomaru ""Do you have someone you wish to protect?"" Sesshomaru of course is not interested about protecting people at that time. For his goal is ""The way of Supreme Conquest"" After that ""The Great Dog Demon"" rushes off to save InuYasha and his mother Iziyoi. Once he arrives at the fortress he uses the ""Wind Scar"" to take care of the men who have captured Iziyoi. He then confronts Takemara of Setsuna. The one responsible for killing Iziyoi. Once ""The Great Dog Demon"" Hears of this he rushes him and takes Takemara's left arm with Tetsusaiga. He then runs in searching for his family. He finds Iziyoi dead as Takemara promised him. He then uses Tenseiga to revieve her. He gives her the Robe of the Fire Rat. Names InuYasha, and tells her to run. He uses his third sword Sounga to fight with Takemara one last time as the burning fortress colapses on them. The begining of the film opens with a bang as you witness ""The Great Dog Demon"" use the ""Three Swords of Supreme Conquest"". The opening scene in this film is worth watching the movie alone. The rest of the movie continues to deliver with spectacular fight scenes between InuYasha and Sesshomaru, the the final Battle with InuYasha and Sesshomaru v.s. Sounga. If you enjoy InuYasha you will enjoy this film. If anyone would like to speak to me about it feel free to contact me over AOL Instant Messenger .
