4643942,4,B005BPTLIQ,"My 12-yr daughter and I moved right into Season 2 as soon as we finished Season 1.

We noticed a few things right away.

1) The screen width was cut down from widescreen to a traditional TV 3:4 ratio picture.
2) The claymation animators made changes to the appearance of some of the characters. These include the Farmer who now has a perpetual 5 o-clock shadow, Blitzer the dog who now has hair-like details rather than the simpler more innocent smooth finish you would be used to seeing on Gromit (if you know Wallace and Gromit) and more detail around the mouth and nose.  The cat has been upgraded from a sort of wolverine/bear like critter to a cat with claws, and it plays a bigger role in season 2 than in season 1.  While a few of these changes were probably a good idea, I think that changes to the characters' appearances were more distracting than beneficial.  Like I mentioned before, these changes made the characters less innocent looking and, well, I missed most of the old versions.
3) One of the things that totally cracked me up about Season 1 was the way that Blitzer blows his whistle and occasionally hands out yellow or red cards, just like a soccer (football) referee.  Sadly, he doesn't do that any more.  I REALLY miss that.

Anyway, changes aside, the series is still worth a look, especially if you still have children around the house.  Oh, and I still love the pigs.  They and the sheet still mix things up from time to time - hilarious!

The animation is still fun and fresh, and changes aside, it's still a solid 4-star offering (considering Wallace and Gromit in their three original adventures as being 5 stars).

If you like Wallace and Gromit or Shaun the Sheep Season 1, you will almost certainly like Season 2 as well.

Keep up the good work!",1320710400,35,1778,4.51875
4643943,5,B005BPTLIQ,"a new collection of Shaun the Sheep  Tales is always reason to cheer.  i have been waiting for this new collection for quite some time. the new episodes  have been released on DVD piece meal, seven tales at a time under various DVD titles, but no complete collection, then  i recently found these all season two episodes on my NetFlix  Video Streaming Service.  i then checked Amazon and found the Second Season was being offered as a PRE ORDER with a due date of November 15.  i did a bit of research and discovered that the set consisted of  forty episodes.  i placed my pre order without hesitation.

i am not going to go over each of the forty episodes, as time and space would not permit it.  suffice it to say, the tales are great fun  to watch.  i've watched some with one of my grand daughters (age 11) and the enjoyment she she displayed  will warm the heart of any grandparent.  all the episodes are worthwhile and be sure to notice all the attention to detail that is diplayed.  the hard work that goes into making these small inanimate creatures move and act as if they're actually alive is impossible to comprehend. Shaun the Sheep, his flock, Bitzer the dog, The Farmer and all the other ""actors"" are truly works of genius by the tatented people who bring them to life.  you cannot go wrong in purchasing this Second Season Collection.  i only hope that these characters will  continue to be brought to life by this band of creators inm future episodes and collections.

there is one small item i do take issue with.  the characters of Bitzer and The Farmer, as wsell as several others have their appearance changed from the way they were originally presented.  i prefer the original way over the current appearence.  it isn't a major issue however.",1318204800,16,1763,4.544585987261146

4644283,2,B005BPTLIQ,"Season 1 of Shaun the Sheep is so good - the stories are well thought out and funny, characters are quirky and charming, and everything looks beautiful. ... I'm actually 30 years old, and I watched all of it and enjoyed every minute of it. Season 1 = 5 stars.

Season 2 is quite different. It's as if someone told the creators of the show they needed to pick up the pace and compete with Spongebob for kid's attention, so it's fast-paced and chaotic, there's a lot more slapstick humor; slow points are now punctuated by fart jokes.

And the writing suffers. In Season 1, each sketch had a simple, clear plot - get the apples from the pigs, etc. - and everything that happened made sense; it was silly, but it made sense. That's not always the case in Season 2. Why would the cat see a documentary about leopards, make itself a leopard suit, and then run outside and terrorize the sheep by pretending to be a werewolf? I don't know.

It doesn't remind me of Wallace and Gromit anymore - this is solidly a kid's show now.

They come from the same creator of Wallace and Gromit, which is also similarly excellent. The sense of humor in this claymation-type animation is unbelievably clever and witty, even though no words are ever spoken and it is mostly slapstick. I had my parents (in their 70s) watch some episodes and they nearly fell out of chairs laughing. Although we love Wallace and Gromit, Shaun the Sheep is sheer genius in our books, and it never gets old in our household.

If you loved Chicken Run and/or Wallace and Gromit, these episodes will knock your socks off, hands down.",1458345600,2,693,4.634146341463414

1.  Drafts blueprints on chalkboards
2.  Does advanced calculus
3.  Irish step dances
4.  Drives
5.  Sword fights
6.  Steers a boat
7.  Develops weight loss plans
8.  Ice skates
9.  Breakdances
10.  Drives a car

This is just the tip of iceberg.  Shaun is a British treasure.  He is enjoyed in my household by everyone and those who visit and don't like him, just aren't cool.  He provides hours of near silent (yes, silent!) entertainment, save for random bleats and assorted farm noises.  Don't like loud kid shows in the background??  This show is for you!  Like BBC drama but claymation cute, this show is for you!

4645119,4,B005BPTLIQ,"It's a great series for adults and children, with a lot of tongue in cheek gags. It's a little repetitive, but it's nice to watch after a day of harrowing news.",1448323200,,160,4.193548387096774
4645120,5,B005BPTLIQ,My son loves it...,1448323200,,18,3.75
4645121,5,B005BPTLIQ,My grandson's age 2 and 4 adore Shaun the Sheep. We don't watch TV often so when we do we are picky. The characters in this show don't talk and the farmer just grumbles in a nonsensical manner. This gives our boys the opportunity to figure out what is happening and what will happen as well as to come up with words for the humans and the animals. It's a great exercise in using their imagination and problem solving skills.,1448236800,,424,4.3125
4645122,5,B005BPTLIQ,A great continuation of the 1st season.  Amusing and hilarious for all family members.,1448236800,,86,5.142857142857143

4645221,5,B005BPTLIQ,"I'm already a big fan of ""Wallace and Grommet"", so it stands to reason that ""Shaun of the Sheep"" would also win my heart. Thank goodness for grandchildren, for being the excuse to watch such delightful programs to begin with! As is the case with many children-targeted programs, the jokes are totally for the adults who are kids at heart. ""Shaun of the Sheep"" really tickles my funny bone. There is no dialogue in the show, just animal sounds and garbled, implied vocalization on the part of the farmer and other humans, but that somehow adds to the charm even more. I love the graphics and the setting for the show, too. Honestly, if you don't have a child or grandchild, borrow one and watch this show! It is great fun, especially at the end of reality-days! Maaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!",1445558400,2,778,4.644927536231884

4645231,5,B005BPTLIQ,Shaun the Sheep is clever. My wife and I love it as much as our kids. Its amazing what they can do with just some stop animation and no dialog on a small farm while other kid shows have almost infinite options with 3D animation and voice actors. These 3D shows can't even come close to what Shaun the Sheep delivers over and over again for my family.,1445472000,,350,4.161764705882353

Furthermore, the show is beneficial. As a teacher of ESOL (English to speakers of other languages) I particularly like it because there is no spoken dialogue between the characters. Everything is inferred through facial expressions and action. It is a great show to show younger and older ELL students who are learning English and allows them a fun, comfortable venue to talk about interesting topics, emotions, and understand western humor!!
In addition, I studied abroad in the 90s in Scotland and remember fondly some of the local sheep farmers. The farm, the animals and their antics brings back memories and makes me think twice about what was happening on the farm when I wasn't looking!!!

4646167,4,B005BPTLIQ,"The Adventures of a smart-alack sheep and his friends which include a very confused dog named Bitzer. This time, Pidsley the cat is included in the mix, however brief. Some  of my favorite episodes are ""Everything must go"" when the farmer puts Bitzer in charge of running a road-side stand to sell a few farm items, but Bitzer then passes the charge to Shaun and the other sheep who sell the farmers house completely bare - Everything is gone (except teeth in a glass). Timmy, the baby, gets on a ATV and goes for a joy-ride in ""The Big Chase"". They tear through the countryside and through the town at break-neck speeds terrifying everyone and everything in their path. In ""The Boat"", the farmer gets an old boat and tells Bitzer to clean it up for him but the sheep climb aboard and begin playing pirate as the boat zooms around the farm. This is stop-action claymation that far exceeds ""Gumby"" levels. But Shaun the Sheep is ""Keystone Kops"" slap-stick humor that transcends all age-groups. The first and second seasons are well worth the investment of owning.",1425081600,,1062,4.679144385026738

4646217,4,B005BPTLIQ,Shaun the Sheep Season 2 [HD] - We stumbled upon this season randomly while looking for something for the younger children in our house.

I'm a 31 year old father of two, but when it comes to TV, I'm an old man.

Turn on Disney Channel and you'll see nothing but smarmy garbage.  Half of shows are about relationships now.  Shows for KIDS are about dating, pop culture, and anything else that is fleeting and hollow and churned out on the cheap.

Shaun the Sheep is the kind of show Walt Disney himself might have approved of.  You can see making the show must be painstaking.  With no dialogue the claymation has to be full of expression.  The characters have character.  It's depth you don't see on television anymore.  Five stars all the way.",1424390400,4,776,4.464285714285714

And though I was raised in KENTUCKY and my Grandfather had a few cows, it was nothing like the wonderful, colorful 'Mossy Bottom Farm' that Shaun and his pal Bitzer the sheep dog, have an uproarious time on! There's also the three pigs, all sorts of chickens and ducks, a huge bull, and a whole gaggle of others. The Ol' Farmer is mystified at the strange happenings going on all around him. He, the farmer, is clueless (never seeing through his thick glasses) the hilarious shenanigans that break out all over his sheep farm everyday! I am very critical of cartoons. I don't like brainless, violent, or the Asian anime onslaught. I love the Disney and Pixar type stuff...animation with heart!...Cartoons should be entertaining, funny, AND ALSO, teach a good value or two along the way.

New season with new episodes, another nice time with Nick Park's awesome sheep.

Again we have Shaun trying to get himself out of trouble or solving a problem someone from the farm is having. But this time, we have changes. As two years passed between the first and second season, Aardman decided to work on some aspects of the show. In the design of the characters, in the image quality, and in the animation.
For the design, Bitzer's fur is textured, the farmer's hair and face more cartoonish, and for Pidsley the cat, a complete redesign has been done. One that I much prefer over the plain reddish one in the first season. About that character, the writers decided to integrate him more into the storylines. Indeed, we have at least five episodes dealing with Pidsley as a major antagonist to either Bitzer, Shaun, or the flock and it's nice because it offers more conflict opportunities for the characters as that cat is very sneaky and mischeavous. We also have the ""fox"" coming this season, for two good episodes where he displays very cunning tactics to attack the farm's habitants.
As for the image quality this season, it is much sharper than in the last one and it shows as the colors are sharp. In fact, I have to say the lighting in this season is even more precise and rich than what we originallly had as we have more tints of colors unlike in the first one where they were fewer. Finally, for the animation, I find the movements of the chracters, their facieal expressions more fluid and expressive; and the use of post-production effects (smokes, fire, vapours, camera zoom-ins or zoom-outs, etc.) more precise than what we had the previous season. As if they were happening inside the story. Some very good ones took place in ""Super Size Timmy"", ""Cat Got Your Brain"", and in ""Spring Lamb"" and ""Bitzer from the Black Lagoon"".

Of the storylines, the quality was as good as in the first season. But this time, we have the special treat of having Nick Park himself (creator of ""Wallace and Gromit"" and ""Shaun the Sheep"") in the writing of one episode entitled ""Party Animals"". That episode, as with ""Cat Got Your Brain"", ""Operation Pidsley"", ""The Big Chase"", and ""Super Size Timmy"", is another favourite I loved to rewatch. But one that I adored was the episode ""Two's Company"" which involved a new character that only appeared in this episode. Which is too bad because considering the ending that episode has, I would have expected the character to come back in other stories or be seen among the animals of the farm. Maybe the writers could reintroduce that character somewhere in a new episode or something.

In the special features, we only have one in the last DVD. An animatic that shows us the storyboard for the episode ""We wish Ewe a Merry Christmas"". Which allows us to know how they set up their episode's framing, animation timework, and know if the story's flowing well or not before doing the animation. Through this bonus, we also see corrections that the director, screenwriter, and animators did together after viewing the animatic and while working on the episode and if you watch closely, you'll clearly see a change they did I felt was better for it added a twist for the characters' actions in that episode.

In conclusion, this Season is another proof that Shaun the Sheep is a success for all ages.",1419465600,,3683,4.642638036809816

4646440,5,B005BPTLIQ,"Amazing creativity. Always guaranteed to give a laugh.  Love this show!

UPDATE:  I kind of agree with some previous reviewers that Season 1 was a bit better.  Seemed to have better plots and you were always rooting for Shaun.  Season 2 seems a little more contrived, not quite as fresh.  Some of the humor has now reverted to slapstick style humor, where characters fall off ladders, get hit on the head with a paint can, walk accidentally into a ditch, etc.

But overall, my wife and I still get a blast out of this show.",1412294400,,523,4.442105263157894

4646444,5,B005BPTLIQ,"Almost everything I liked about Wallace and Gromit is here in Shaun the Sheep (missing Gromit though, boooo). Shaun is the diminutive leader of the sheep; Bitzer the dog ""herds"" the flock by blowing a coach's whistle and checking them off his clipboard; and The Farmer bumbles through life, never knowing that the real brains on the farm is Shaun. Sweet, smart, and funny, Shaun is constantly trying to make things better for his fellow sheep. His looks of exasperation, sigh, and gentle eye-roll before he saves the day are the best. The cast of characters is hilariously rendered in clay by Aardsman, the wildly creative Brits of Wallace and Gromit fame. Each 20-minute segment has three cartoons, all ending with Shaun erratically driving a truck full of sheep, the flock Irish step dancing (my favorite), or Shaun showing off his disco moves. Very endearing, refreshing, and clean fun. These are cartoons you can show your two-year-old with confidence. Highly recommend.",1412121600,,974,5.055900621118012

4646618,5,B005BPTLIQ,"We've watched this series since our girls were two and four years old. I recommend this series specifically for families with small kids for the following reasons:

1) No questionable language. In fact, there really aren't spoken words in any of the episodes. Lots of grunting and baa-ing by humans and animals, but no intelligible words.
2) Little violence. I think there are just a few episodes in the whole series in which the sheep and piggies get catapulted or thrown from one side of the stone fence to the other, sheep fall from trees, etc., but it is done in a very unrealistic way and no lasting harm is done.
3) Good for those with shorter attention spans. The <30 minute episodes are broken into two or three vignettes, which allows kids (and adults) with shorter attention spans to enjoy a quick, brainless <10 minute escape. This is also good if you want to limit your children's TV viewing but want them to become familiar with pop culture so they don't become social outcasts. I have to admit, that was one reason I didn't mind my girls watching Dora, Little Einsteins, and Shaun the Sheep; I didn't want them to become ""weird kids"" when they started school.
4) FREE (right now) Instant Watch streaming for Prime Members! Yea!!

I think there is a show on one of the kiddie cable channels called ""Timmy Time""--Timmy also appears in Shaun the Sheep, so those of you with kids who like Timmy Time will definitely want to take a look at this series.",1401926400,,1461,4.593869731800766
4646619,5,B005BPTLIQ,Not sure a more perfect show could be created.  We watch these episodes over and over.  Even I never seem to get tired of them and we've been watching them for over three years now with my children.,1401926400,,198,4.184210526315789
4646620,5,B005BPTLIQ,"Perfect for toddlers and clever enough to keep parents entertained (even after the 20th viewing!).  This is a great alternative to the obnoxious kids' shows out there and there's little content that anyone might find objectionable - although if seeing a sheep in it's undies is too risqu for you, you might want to pass. ;-)",1401840000,,324,4.785714285714286

4646623,5,B005BPTLIQ,"Great show! It's always clever and well written (which is interesting considering there's almost no dialogue in the entire show).

Shaun is an all-purpose sheep, who problem solves how to fix a squeaky windmill, rescue a baby lamb's toy, and ruin the Farmer's date. He clog dances. He discoes. He can lead the sheep in their daily aerobics. You don't need to know English or talk at all to love Shaun the Sheep. Great for people of all ages!",1401667200,,472,4.314606741573034

4646663,5,B005BPTLIQ,"This is a very clever series.  No actual dialog -- hey, they're animals, right?  Well, sort of.  The sheep, pigs, ducks, dog and Farmer get in all sorts of pickles and -- I find this the best aspect of these skits -- work together to fix what's wrong.
There is no meanness in these skits.  The ""lesson"" for the watcher is one of using cooperation to get things done.
The visual appeal is great because the characters are not computer generated (a perfectly fine method) but stop motion -- each real piece is posed and recorded one frame at a time, then moved, recorded, moved, etc.
Each character has its own distinct personality.  Shaun is the star -- a cute friend to all.

Added 2015:

The stories are mostly small morality tales.  They are never mean or negative.  The sheep get into a lot of mischief, but they all the characters work to solve whatever has gone wrong.
They keep your attention because they have no dialogue.
Shaun and friends is aimed at about the 5-year old set.  Well, I am in my sixties, and I love these guys!",1399939200,2,1035,4.428571428571429

Plenty of homage to books and classic movies that'll keep you watching over and over to see what you missed.

4646711,5,B005BPTLIQ,I  highly recommend Shaun the Sheep.  Just looking at the characters lifts my spirits and makes me laugh.  No dialogue is needed to understand what is happening.  There are so many clever touches and the stories always have a surprise element of some type.,1397520000,,256,4.75

I was scouring for the least annoying possibilities to view with my young daughter and finally succumbed to put this on. I regret absolutely nothing, except perhaps waiting for so long. There is no dialog, just grunts, groans and baas, and the plots are short and simple, yet easy to watch and follow along. Bravo to the animators for giving us yet another lovable series that doesn't insult the intelligence of youth, but simply tells a fun and endearing story.",1397347200,,644,4.608695652173913

They changed Blitzer's fur.  Why?
The poop in the field is gone.  Why?
It seems a little more contrived this time.

4646742,5,B005BPTLIQ,Very well done. What else can I say but that it was good. The rest is history. To much detail for just watccing a show,1396137600,,118,3.76
4646743,4,B005BPTLIQ,"Shaun the Sheep is clever, has no annoying songs or catchphrases and is very well done. Consequently, I don't mind watching it a hundred times a day.

Bitzer, the farmer's dog, spends most of each show trying to keep the peace and prevent the farmer from seeing the chaos on his farm. The three pigs antagonize everyone as does the cat. The ducks are observers but somehow manage to get caught up in the action. Shaun and the flock try to restore order while Bitzer referees the pandemonium. The shows start with nischief and mayhem only to be brought under control by the show's end by Bitzer, Shaun, and the flock. All this is done with no spoken words! Very original and very enjoyable to watch.",1395964800,,690,4.57258064516129

This is a TV series about a farmer and his faithful dog and their, particularly one sheep named Shaun, who, at times shows much more intelligence than said farmer.  I would like to point out that the storylines are NOT meanspirited. The only""villains"" are the pigs and the house cat.  This whole series is fun for the whole family.

4646757,5,B005BPTLIQ,"This series is fun and funny. I'm a huge fan of Nick Parks and his stop motion animation. It's beautifully constructed and gives a feel that can't be matched with other animation. The icing on the cake is that the humor can't be beat either. And, it's humor that a 3 yr old will laugh her head off while mom sits next to her, smiling with laughing out loud bouts too. LOVE IT!",1395446400,,376,4.164383561643835

The only thing is my daughter is no longer such a big fan now that's she 5 yrs old. She loved it before and my son still does (he's 4) so I'd say it's perfect for the under 5 crowd.

4646863,5,B005BPTLIQ,"Shaun remains his lively self, and his doggie friend Bitzer is more charming than ever.  My favorite episode has Bitzer cooking up an elaborate meal for the farmer and his beautiful lady-friend.  Of course the shy farmer's ego and romantic prospects are on the line, so naturally he'd want to put his trusted dog in charge of the cooking. Wouldn't you?  Bitzer wears his heart on his sleeve and does his best, but wouldn't you know it ... things go wrong!  Oh no!  It's all very lovely and cute as the dickens.

This show is a pure winner.  Every character is charming, even the not-very-villainous villains, and the problems, snafus, and oopses come about and get resolved in an upbeat way.  The claymation is visually charming and very inventive; it's always a treat to see what unlikely thing they've managed to animate, and fun to try to imagine how they could possibly have done it.

It is more oriented toward a child's level of attention than Nick Park's other hugely popular claymation winner, Wallace & Grommit, but would not be at all hard for an adult to sit through with his child.  Heck, I often can't stop at one and wind up watching a second or even third.  The episodes are pretty re-watchable, too.  Highly recommended, especially for kids and lovers of state-of-the-art claymation.",1391472000,,1299,4.75

As a sheep farmer, I was immediately intrigued, and decided to check it out.  I was hooked from the first intro!  Shaun is such a cute little guy, with his 'sheepish' grin and cute little lamb bleats.  But it's the 'innocent mischievousness of Shaun and his pals that is so clever and funny.  Sheep are definitely prone to getting themselves in trouble if given half a chance.  I don't think mine have quite learned how to use the arc welder or power tools yet, but I have come home a few times and sworn the tractor was not where I left it.  And I'm certain that the barn radio was NOT tuned to the hip-hop station when I left.  Whoever writes this show definitely knows sheep!",1388793600,,804,4.385135135135135

Story lines are still funny, but not nearly the side splitting, panty wetting, roll on the floor stories any more.  Still way better than most of the childrens drivel available out there.",1388707200,,408,5.246153846153846

4646987,5,B005BPTLIQ,"I LOVE this show! My husband and I love this almost as much as our little boy. There are no words, just music, sound effects, and the actions of the characters. This taps in to a child's creativity and allows them to think through the situations to discover why things are happening on screen the way they do. My little boy has Asperger's and deciphering facial cues is not his strong suit. These types of cartoons force him to focus on the facial expressions and actions of the characters to figure out cause and effect. Plus, it is hilarious! Each sheep has his or her own personality and some of the farm animals are in prank wars with each other (oh, those pigs). The farmer is blissfully clueless and the sheep and dog work hard to keep it that way. When my son was much younger, this was the only thing he would watch before bed. Give it a try - you won't regret it - and be sure to keep an eye out for Shaun's breakdancing!",1388534400,,930,4.259887005649717

The program is just good clean fun!  The animals expressions and actions really make the shows hilarious. I would rather watch Shaun the Sheep on my Kindle then wasting my time with the nonsensical programs available now for young children. As a grandmother, I would rather my grandson watch programs like Shaun the Sheep vs. the garbage that is on TV these days.  The shows are Definitely worth downloading, whether young or old.

There are a total of 13 episodes, so there must be something like 39 stories total in Season 2. I like that because I often watch on my tablet when I go to bed. When I get really sleepy I can just shut it off at the end of a story (instead of the whole episode) and resume the episode the next day.

Shaun has many of the qualities we'd all love to have. He's kind, considerate, non-violent, curious, clever, funny and thoughtful and gets himself and the whole farm into ridiculously funny situations. If you've never seen Shaun, you must.

4647245,2,B005BPTLIQ,"The first season of Shaun the Sheep is brilliant: simple stories, a genuine wit and charm and an innocence in the plots and characters.  None of them have ill intentions, except for the pigs who are the antagonists.  I am and always will be a huge fan of season one.

Season two, however, is a stark change from season one and the humor has changed from simple wit and charm to offensive humor.  The nature of the characters have changed as well, as now it is not simply Shaun trying to have fun, coming up with a plan, and then shenanigans ensuing.  The second season makes every character to be a manipulative opportunist, including the dog, each of the sheep including Shaun, and even the cat.  If I wanted to watch television with a bunch of jerks I'd just watch regular television.

In the second season I saw Shaun flip the bird (as in his middle finger,) the flock sabotage each other, and the farmer try to make a buck off of some ducks on his farm.  The first season showed the flock to be united, the farmer was not THAT opportunistic, and there were definitely no middle fingers.  In the first season it shows that everyone listens to Shaun and likes and respects him, whereas in season two the flock and the dog at one point are laughing at him and gesturing that he's crazy.

It is a sad change and the show lost all of its heart in Season 2.",1370131200,3,1355,4.341269841269841

Honestly, what were the creators of the show thinking when they changed it? Oh well, I can watch Season 1 over and over and over and never get tired of it!",1368144000,,411,4.012195121951219

Shaun the sheep was unique,because the characters didn't do violent things to each other, and weren't insulting...it was an obvious the writers/creators stuck to that format.  In Season 2, they reverted to, well, being like every other Tom and Jerry cartoon.  It's still very good stuff, but a little disappointing for the change.",1361059200,3,368,5.1

We look forward to the next season.  If you like Shaun the Sheep, stick with the seasons.  The other videos all come from the seasons.  This is created by Nick Park, the same person that created Wallace and Gromit.  He also created a Timmy Time for younger viewers.  Shaun the Sheep is my daughter's favourite of the three.

4647277,5,B005BPTLIQ,"We LOVE Shaun the Sheep.  This DVD contains 40 episodes (each about 7 minutes long) from season 2 of the British series.  These are appropriate and enjoyable for all ages (big giggles from 3 to adult).  Everyone in our family enjoys this series.  The plots center around the adventures of Shaun and his flock of sheep.  They live on a farm with a well-meaning but somewhat clueless farmer.  The sheep battle their rivals, the cat and the wily pigs with the help of the sheep dog, Bixby.  In these shorts, there are no words, this is pure pantomime.  Highly recommend!",1341014400,,567,4.6

I added images of the back of the DVD case to show this.  16x9 is an improvement on the 4x3 presentation of Shaun Season 1 episodes for Region 1.
The only 4x3 format items I've found so far are: the hit entertainment intro & menu, the LionsGate gearwheel intro, and a trailer for ""Off the Baa!"" The other disk 1 trailers are widescreen.

4647284,2,B005BPTLIQ,"After being pleasantly surprised by Season #1 of Shaun the Sheep, I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife looking forward to many more intriguing farm life adventures with Shaun. Sadly, something has changed between Season #1 and Season #2. Not just the farmers cat and Bitzer's face - something more fundamental. Whereas the first season's episodes drew the audience in to the entertaining farm life of these silly clay animals, the second season's episodes just seem to rush from one dumb joke to the next. Is it because of a new director, new writers? I don;t know, but it is distinctly different. The light hearted charm of season #1 cannot be found in season #2. In addition, whereas season #1 was not offensive, season #2 often shows examples of Shaun or the other animals stealing, or destroying things for fun. And, is it just me, or is the farmer's underwear in EVERY SINGLE season #2 episode?
  I must admit that I had high hopes for Season #2, and I have been disappointed. Perhaps Season #3 will go back to the original wit and style of season #1? I can only hope....",1326412800,47,1082,4.572164948453608
