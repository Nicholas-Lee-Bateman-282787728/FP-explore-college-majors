My only disappointment is the Bloxbys. The book characters were so much better.  Overall, this series is fun and clever.",1470960000,33,269,4.489795918367347

7765267,3,B01GQ10L32,"While many of the other reviews compared the stories to the book I have not read the stories so am reviewing the shows on their own.
The story line can't decide if it is a mystery of comedy.  Often they will take a strange turn for a joke and forget the mystery.  There are some good lines but over all the DVD was a easy way to pass some time when you don't want to have to think.",1525392000,,381,3.871794871794872
7765268,4,B01GQ10L32,"My wife and I are looking forward to season 2 coming out late 2018.  Interesting characters, and one thing unique about this is that some of the characters being developed end up being murder victims - in the first season!  Definitely a different twist from others we have seen.  The town is filled with unique characters, so they do not stop bringing others back.  Kind of wondering who will be victims in season 2.",1525305600,,416,4.581081081081081

7765272,4,B01GQ10L32,"This is a fun but silly series, based on the M.C. Beaton books. Something between a comedy and a mystery. Ashley Jensen is super cute in the title role. Mathew Horne (Gavin in ""Gavin and Stacey"") is not at his best in this role and Lucy Lieman as Sarah is underutilized, the part having been seriously downsized compared to the books. The series is shot entirely in a few blocks of one tiny cozy cute Cotswold village. Very picturesque but almost claustrophobic. Apparently, a second season has been commissioned. It would be nice to develop some of the characters a bit more--D.C. Wong, the vicar, Roy, etc. and to widen the focus geographically. The filming of the series has more of a tight-shot feel like ""Father Brown"" rather than the sort of travelogue feel like the early""Midsomer Murders"". Maybe it's a budget issue?",1523232000,,824,4.769230769230769

7765283,5,B01GQ10L32,This is a fun series. The main character is a blond and a little goofy in her own way. But she's a successful business woman who's had enough of the bid city and has moved to a small English town where the fun starts. While looking for love and trying to be accepted in the small community she becomes involved in the towns first murder. While competing with the local police trying to solve the mystery she gets involved with community affairs beyond all expectations. The whole series becomes murder solving mysteries as one person after another falls prey to death. Unfortunately I was not able to watch the last disk as I discovered it was cracked and would not play. Now I have to order a new set to see the last episodes. I hope this series continues.,1516060800,2,757,4.453237410071942
7765284,3,B01GQ10L32,Not as good as hoped for.  Hard to identify with the main characters personality and the cheerless tone.  Strongly recommend  Murder in Suburbia if youd like more of an upbeat wit and charm.,1515110400,,190,4.696969696969697

I like the TV Agatha R better, actually, but Mrs Bloxby and her husband (though likeable) bothered me - the TV versions were just too young.  I do wish they had filmed more episodes.

7765290,5,B01GQ10L32,"Don't know what it is about this show but I think it is a delight.  The star Ashley Jensen is a hoot.  I've watched her with Ricky Gervais on Extras
and fell out laughing every time she had a scene - I just think she is hilarious.  Would definitely look forward to future episodes but not sure I can explain why I enjoy this show so much - English villages - yuppies - murder mysteries - nothing earth-shakingly new but maybe it is just Ashley
Jensen's energy.  If you like her - check it out.",1508630400,,493,4.157894736842105

7765293,5,B01GQ10L32,"Agatha Raisin is another one of those entertaining and addictive mystery series that the British seem to do so well. In this 2016 production, loosely based on M.C. Beaton's popular books, Ashley Jensen delightfully plays our heroine Agatha Raisin, a forthright and successful business woman, who is both funny and flawed, a thoroughly modern Millie of our time. Filmed in beautiful Biddestone, Wiltshire, Agatha retires to the English countryside seeking the idyllic village life, but instead discovers murder and mayhem more reminiscent of Badger's Drift. If you're looking for a light and comfortable cozy mystery, Agatha Raisin is sure to please. Highly recommended!",1505779200,,669,5.504854368932039
7765294,1,B01GQ10L32,"Simply Terrible.

I loved the books but whoever did the casting for the TV show should be shot.

Agatha is nothing like the book. Most of the others fall far short too.

Marian Chesney should be ashamed to be associated with this drivel.",1505779200,,237,4.465116279069767
7765295,5,B01GQ10L32,"Loved the series.  It was a little hard at first, because I have read the Agatha Raisin books by MC Beaton, and this is definitely different from the books.  Agatha is younger and prettier for one thing (but not too young).  Roy Silver is spot on, and Bill Wong is ok.  The cleaner, Delores?  Dorris?  Is now a young single mom who fancies Bill and has a much closer relationship with Agatha.

The books aside, I really did enjoy this series.  It was light fun British mystery at its best, and the village was just gorgeous.  I bought the DVD series for my mom.  I do hope they make a season 2.",1505692800,,594,4.223214285714286

7765318,5,B01GQ10L32,"I have read some the Agatha Raisin books (more than twenty years ago). I love how the TV series has been updated for more modern times. Some viewers have mentioned that the lead character Agatha Raisin had a decade or more knocked off her age, and some other characters (most notably her cleaner is now half her original age.)

Personally I love the tv adaptation more than the actual books. In the tv series Agatha is still anxious to fit in and to be loved. Her surrogate family and neighbors are younger than they are in the books. But each episode (after this movie) is filled with delightful writing (subtle humor) and wonderful acting from everyone involved.

My only quibble is that there is only one movie and one season in the series. I hope in the future they find a way to bring all the players back to the small screen again.",1499126400,,837,4.4640522875816995

MC Beaton's Hamish Macbeth has always been a favorite but somehow the Agatha books just held no appeal. After watching the DVDs, I am hooked. I am now on the 7th book in the series. Yes, there is a difference between the written description of the characters and their portrayals on film. But, as a city person who moved to a small farming town, I can so identity with the stylish leather-clad Agatha and her attempts to fit into fleece-and-Wellington lifestyle.

7765341,4,B01GQ10L32,"""Agatha Raisin"" Series 1 offers a 90-minute pilot, ""Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death,"" and eight 45-minute episodes based on the comic mystery novels by M.C. Beaton. Agatha Raisin (Ashley Jensen) is the middle-aged owner of a successful London public relations firm, who quits her job to move to the picturesque village of Carsley in the Cotswolds, before she's too old to enjoy the change. Upon arriving in her idyllic, fully furnished, new home, Agatha throws herself into village life, trying desperately to fit in with the local folk while decked out in orange stilettos and a lot of fuchsia. She picks up a brochure for the Quiche Competition, steals her neighbor's maid Gemma Simpson (Katy Wix), is the victim of the town's first home burglary in decades, and is accused of murder, when her quiche apparently kills one of the judges, Andy Cummings-Browne (Robert Bathurst).

Thus begins Agatha Raisin's career in detection. With the help of Gemma, neighbor James Lacey (Jamie Glover), after whom Agatha pines constantly, local cop DC Bill Wong (Matt McCooey), after whom Gemma pines constantly, and former advertising colleague Roy Silver (Mathew Horne), Agatha follows the never-ending trail of bodies that dot the English countryside and tracks down their murderers, always dressed to the nines. This series is similar to ""Midsomer Murders"" but comedic by design, and the episodes are mercifully short. The recurring characters are good-natured, friendly people. Sometimes the comedy falls flat, but there is at least one laugh-out-loud scene in every episode. I haven't read the books, but I understand that some characters, including Agatha's appearance, have been changed for television.

I can't say how much I would be bothered by the changes, if I had read the books, but this is fun, light entertainment in the tradition of English village murder mysteries first made famous by Agatha Christie's Miss Maple. I found the first few episodes mediocre, but Agatha Raisin's brand of humor grew on me, and I got into the spirit of it. The absurdist plots and over-the-top production design are clever in their own way, and the show unabashedly gives its audience maximum entertainment value for the investment. Agatha's wardrobe, hair, and makeup have a lot of visual impact that enhances the comedy. So just stare incredulously at Agatha, like the villagers do, and enjoy the ride. Actually, I admire the effort she puts into her look; the result is just rather startling.",1491004800,3,2487,5.1382716049382715

Besides, a lot of brunettes look better when age has miraculously turned them into blondes overnight.  The wit, the humor, and the hard surface over a marshmallow center remain.  More episodes should definitely be produced.  The costuming alone deserves an Emmy Award, but notin the sense that Downton Abbey did for historical representations but for capturing the true essence of a character in a jacket.

Liked the actress who played Agatha, but Agatha in the book series was a middle aged brunette, not blonde and gorgeous.  Did not like the roles assigned to the Bloxbys - at all.  A completely new character, Gemma, was introduced to be Agatha's sidekick instead of Roy, Charles and James and other men.  She also is portrayed as Agatha's BFF instead of Ms. Bloxby who is seen as just another villager for the most part.  I didn't picture any of the characters as they are shown in these videos.

7765388,3,B01GQ10L32,"Part of the problem with Agatha Raisin is that the pilot and the first episode were top shelf: the emphasis on the humor rather than the silliness of solving an improbable murder. By the third installment, it had become nothing more than a typical serial about too many murders in a way too small village. Whoever it was at the writers' table who was adding something fresh to the script must have left and the show degenerates into ""Murder She Wrote"" and ""Legally Blonde."" Yawn. I guess one could continue to watch it because the Cotwalds scenery is part of the plot the way Oxford has a staring role in Inspectors Morse and Lewis or Northumberland stars in Vera, but the lightweight characters in AR are not enough to bolster up the predictable plots: who's new in the village, eliminate the sympathetic character, it has to be the other one. Yawn. It's a shame. I do wish the writers had watched the first two episodes and thought, ""Now that's a winning idea.""",1483920000,,963,4.604651162790698

7765399,5,B01GQ10L32,"Not having read any of the Agatha Raisin cozies by M.C. Beaton (and there are over 25), I came into the show without any preconceived notions. Perhaps if I had, I would be more persnickety about what the characters looked like, or if they were more humorous in the books.

I did really enjoy the shows, which reminded me a bit of Rosemary and Thyme. Although I liked it, and will watch future seasons, it didn't grab me enough to start reading the books. Mainly because having seen these, I would think it would spoil the books because I already would know who was the killer.

Agatha is a legend in the PR world, who knows how to work the system to get whatever her clients want. But when she moves to the quaint village, she is completely out of her realm. In the very first episode she enters a quiche making contest thinking she will wow the villagers and make  lots of new friends. One huge problem though, she doesnt cook. So she buys a quiche, and things go downhill very quickly. Not only does someone get poisoned, but it is found out that she cheated.

She takes it upon herself to find out what really happened, and to try and get some of the villagers to be more friendly towards her. But anyone whos ever lived in a small town knows that it can take years, even decades, before someone new is accepted into the community.

The rest of the episodes continue with Agatha solving more mysteries with the help of her housekeeper (who I think is adorable, and I want a friend like her), DCI Wong (who has a crush on Agatha, who is older than him), and various others people from the village. Agathas love life ebbs and flows through the episodes.

And although Im not into shoes, Agathas were amazing, as well as her outfits. I found myself looking forward to seeing what she would be wearing. All in all, I enjoyed the first season very much, and will watch any more that are made.",1481500800,,1890,4.385714285714286

My collection includes Poirot, all the Marple and Miss Marple series, Lewis, Inspector Alleyn, Lord Peter Wimsey, etc.  This is in a bit more of a comedic vein but stands up with them all.

Bloxbly and Mrs. Bloxby as older, staid people for just one example. In the books, Agatha's house cleaner was NOT named Gemma, but Doris Simpson and she was much older.

By the end of the first episode I was getting used to the actors/actresses playing the various characters.  By the end of the series I found I really enjoyed it.  There have been some changes made to the other characters; her cleaning woman is much more prominent but that's to the good, Bill Wong's boss is very funny (and he can dance!).

Given that Agatha has no patience what so ever, she determines that she wants to fit into the village NOW (her ""fit in"" is synonymous with ""be a mover & shaker""). She's just in time for the annual Village Fete where the highest honor is reserved for the winner of the Quiche Contest. What better way to become one with the village than to win the Quiche Contest  even if she has to cheat.

Her cheating is found out. Agatha would be in the doghouse with the villagers except that a local is killed and Agatha solves the murder. After that, Agatha is Carsely's ""own Miss Marple"" and all is forgiven.

Agatha goes on to solve more murders, which is nice as it keeps her churning mind busy. She is not totally likeable, but she is certainly interesting and a force to be reckoned with. This is an amateur detective series with a lot of humor. In particular, I laughed out loud while watching ""Witch of Wyckhadden.""

1.  ""Quiche of Death"" (Pilot, 2-episode length) The plot is given above. We're introduced to the recurring characters, including, Detective Constable Bill Wong, who suffers a cougar crush on Agatha. His boss, D.C.I. Wilkes of the South Gloucester Police, is one of the worst drawn characters. His lines should be funny, but they come off as cartoonish.
2.  ""Walkers of Dembley"" Agatha joins a hiking ""ramble"" over the fields, and everyone is startled by a warning shot. Jessica Tartinck, leading another hiking group, confronts a farmer who warns that they are trampling on crops. Jessica is in his face and frankly annoying. But is that any reason to kill her?
3.  ""Hell's Bells""  Carsely's church has just rehung the five bells in its bell tower. Amanda Ballard, a young widow new to town, leads a group of 5 people in learning the not-as-easy-as-it-looks art of bell-ringing. Amanda is one of the 5, which is why it is she is who discovers Amanda - hung from one of the bells.
4.  ""The Wellspring of Death"" In the nearby town of Ancombe, acrimony reigns at the Parish Council meeting. Angela states her case, ""The spring arises in my aunt's garden... and she has the legal right to sell the rights to that spring water to whichever company she chooses."" Julia argues that the water company tankers are disruptive and the council should not allow them access. Chairman Robert Struthers has the deciding vote, and he insists he won't make up his mind until the morning. If he's still alive in the morning.
5.  ""The Potted Gardener"" It's only two days before Carsely's Open Gardens Competition. Which Agatha has decided to win. Everybody wakes to find their garden displays uprooted. Especially at the house across from Agatha's, where the owner has been ""planted"" head down in her own garden.
6. ""The Vicious Vet"" The grocer confides to Agatha, ""New vet. Very handsome by all accounts. Lots of animals suddenly taking a turn for the worse."" That's not something Agatha can resist. She gets her cat and heads over to meet the new vet in appropriate attire -  a leopard-patterned pencil skirt, black burnout lace blouse and stilettos. Who would think that it's the vet who needs to be put down?
7.  ""The Day the Floods Came"" The big house in the area is Barfield Hall, and new owner Charles Fraith has rented the grounds for a wedding. Agatha, using her London skills, is running the arrangements, which is why she's on hand to see the bride-to-be sobbing. But the wedding goes on, and it's not until the next morning that a woman is found looking as lovely and as dead as the floating Ophelia.
8.  ""Witch of Wyckhadden"" Agatha is putting suitcases into the car trunk and telling Gemma, ""I'm not running away. I've got a family crisis.""
Gemma: ""But you don't have a family.""
WHYever Agatha is running becomes apparent, after she's checked into her rooms at the castle once home to the Earl of Wykhadden. Glorious Tudor ceilings, coats of armor and mounted horns all around. And murder. As the manager tells her, ""Murder is clearly good for business.""
9.  ""Murderous Marriage"" It is impossible to give a synopsis of this plot without major spoilers, so I'll just say that someone close, if not so dear, is going to end up dead.

The Agatha Raisin pilot, ""Quiche of Death"", first aired in December 2014. The following 8 episodes of Season 1 aired in June/July 2016. All of the episodes, including the pilot, are based on mystery novels of the same name by M.C. Beaton. Beaton is the nom de plume of Marion Chesney. To date, she's published 27 Agatha Raisin mysteries.

Ashley Jensen, who plays Agatha with an occasional burrr in her speech, is from Scotland herself. I hardly recognized her as Agatha in her ""real life"" photo. In a 6/12/16 interview with Simon Button, Jensen says this about her character: ""My hair is more angular and the lipstick terrifying. The character has a strong visual identity.... I can now walk on any terrain in stiletto heels.""

The DVD set combines the Pilot and Season 1 and totals 462 minutes without commercials. The show is presented in 16:9 with Dolby Digital 5.1. The DVD has English SDH subtitles on all the episodes and on the Bonus Features (except the Photo Gallery).

Bonus Features total 18 minutes and are mediocre compared to many features I've watched on other series. Commentators include Robert Bathurst (plays Andy), Mathew Horne (plays Roy), Ashley Johnson (plays Agatha), Barry Ryan (producer), Johnny Ludlow (location manager), M.C. Beaton (author), Matt McCooey (plays DC Wong), Katy Wix (plays Gemma), Jason Barnett (plays D.I. Wilkes) and Jamie Glover (plays James).
In bonus B, M.C. Beaton says, ""It is the book, but not as you know it.... But they kept to the plot. They kept to the spirit of the book.""
....A.  ""Welcome to Carsley""
....B.  ""From Script to Screen""
....C.  ""Meet the Cast""
....D.  ""Introducing Agatha""
....E.  ""About the Show""
....F.  ""Agatha is Back""
....G.  ""From P.R. to P.I.""
....H.  Photo Gallery

As I watched the series, I got more into the characters, and they contributed more to the show than took away from it. The plots seem good to me, but they can be hard to find within the character drama. As a mystery lover, ""Agatha Raisin Series 1"" is an enjoyable 4.3 stars, rounded down to 4.

I thought Hetty Wainthrope showed more sincere slething abilities.  Besides no real woman would constantly wear 4 to 5 inch high heels in the countryside of stones and mud, etc. Ridiculous, not funny!

7765429,2,B01GQ10L32,"This is supposed to be a comedy with a bit of mystery thrown in for spice.  The said truth is that the film is a dog.  It is completely unfunny and without any sort of charm or intelligence.  Stereotypes abound (e.g. a wholly ridiculous black Anglican clergyman), and one writhes at every unsuccessful effort at arouse laughter.  Agatha Raisin is embarrassing, revealing too much about the annihilation of British culture.  And what gall to charge such an outrageous price.",1477526400,8,473,4.936708860759493

7765431,5,B01GQ10L32,"I've enjoyed reading Agatha Raisin mysteries for years.  She is a kind of reverse Miss Marple having moved from the city to a village and is using her city smarts to solve village murders.  I'm happy to say that this series is great and I recommend it to all mystery fans.  This series follows the plot lines of the books, with enough changes to update it to the 21st century and adjustments to the timing of events that one would expect in adapting a book to a series episode.  I kept thinking while watching that the spirit of Agatha is the same, and an interview with author M. C. Beaton (Marion Chesney) validates this feeling.  She was pleased with Ashley Jenson's portrayal of Agatha and spoke also to the idea of the spirit remaining the same.  I was also impressed with the number of lines of dialogue taken directly from the books.  I laugh out loud while reading Agatha Raisin mysteries and I laughed even more seeing these stories brought to life with such good acting and attention to detail. Filmed in an actual village, the setting is perfect for Agatha's adventures.  I don't want to say too much about the stories because if you don't know Agatha Raisin, this is the perfect opportunity to meet her.  If you are a fan of the books, don't miss this adaptation, the character portrayals are just what you would wish, the scenery is gorgeous, and each episode tells a good story.",1476662400,2,1392,4.5582329317269075
7765432,5,B01GQ10L32,"A Cotswolds small village amateur sleuth evolves from mysteries based on M.C. Beaton novels. A feature-length pilot is followed by the series from 2016. A light-hearted family-viewable crime show. I laughed, I enjoyed. Expect humor, as should be derived from the mystery solving character named Agatha--as in Agatha Christie perhaps? The crime drama/comedy mix reminds me of fun TV series like Pie in the Sky and Hamish Macbeth, the second of which is also based on MC Beaton characters.

The eclectic quirky character list headed by Ashley Jensen as Agatha includes James the handsome, available neighbor (Jamie Glover); local cops DC Wong (Matt McCooey) & DCI Wilkes (Jason Barnett); cleaner Gemma (Katy Wix); and a London PR associate (Mathew Horne). A darling old couple pops in/out (Richard Durden & Marcia Warren).

SDH SUBTITLES for feature-length pilot, 8 45 min. episodes, and 18 min. of video bonus. Each story is adapted from a novel by the same name.
&nbsp;The Quiche of Death (2014) ==With London in her dust, Agatha Raisin retires to Carsely, a to-die-for country village in the Cotswolds. Shes attempting to fit with the locals, even entering the Village Fete Quiche Cooking Contest. Her effort proves wrongDEAD wrong. See Robert Bathurst (Downton A) and Sandy McDade (Larkrise to Candleford) as guests.
&nbsp;Walkers of Dembley (series 2016) ==Ramblers fight over a footpath crossing the Barfield House land owned by Sir Charles (Jason Merrells Larkrise to Candleford). Agatha looks for the rambler leaders killer aided by James in a semi-intimate method. See Rebecca Night Fanny Hill).

&nbsp;The Wellspring of Death ==Council chair and deciding vote about Ancombe Water Co. is found dead by head smashing. While doing freelance PR work for the mineral water, Agatha also seeks a murderer.
&nbsp;The Potted Gardener ==Local village gardens are vandalized prior to the contest followed by the murder of a contest gardener. Evidence digs up a bit of a soiled past for the deceased.
&nbsp;The Vicious Vet ==A village pet pandemic erupts when a handsome, available vet hands a shingle. Agatha gets her own vet date right before the Doc gets a lethal overdose of horse anesthetic while working in the stable of Lord Pendlebury (Douglas Reith Downton A).

(Change)
I've read all the Agatha Raisin books and have not found her mean. She has human weaknesses that are part of her insecurities. She always tries to look her best buying that special dress and accesories for that special date. And she's always going to the beauty parlor to look her best, and men find her sexy. One comment said she's dreadfully dumpy? Have you actually read the books?",1475280000,2,415,4.621621621621622

Ashley Jensen and her costars carry off the physical comedy  with ease.  I know a series has gotten under my skin when I find myself thinking what are the characters doing now even after the last credits have rolled. Please tell me there will be a Season 2. I haven't read the first book in this series but I will now. I will also be buying this series when it comes available.

7765435,5,B01GQ10L32,"I also watched this series on Acorn via Amazon. I tried reading the books on recommendation by my best friend, but couldn't do it. Agatha as written is just plain mean. In the tv series she's a bit snarky and blunt at times, but in a humorous way. The series also made her fashionable (love her clothes.) In the books she's dreadfully dumpy. It didn't seem appropriate as she's supposed to have been a highly successful executive in London. She's strong yet vulnerable. Which makes her quite likeable. And she's very, very clever. Mainly she fiercely wants to belong and be happy. Unfortunately she's finding it more difficult than she imagined.",1474329600,2,645,4.81981981981982
7765436,5,B01GQ10L32,"If you're tired of all the pretentious, exploitive American crime series and getting a bit bored by ""Midsommer Mysteries,"" this British series may be just the tonic.  The show's whodunnit element  is a mere excuse for setting, characterization, and production, all of which are so pat, perfect and shallow as to be on the cartoonish level.  But the show pays close attention to detail--on every level--from wildly improbable characters to the ultra quaint features of the Cottswalds to continually shifting points of focus (if Agatha wears on you, her friends, associates and neighbors will quickly take up the slack).  There's something for everybody--including lots of physical comedy--in this agreeable piece of British fluff.

Five stars is admittedly generous, but as a new series struggling for enough viewers to justify a repeat season, I can't begrudge such a well-made production a star or two (the show always gets a few howls from me but not my wife. Humor is always a very personal preference).

The show is not above some sexual / bathroom humor but rarely is blue material at once so azure and innocuous.  The first episode seemed a bit long at 90 minutes, but you may need it for exposition of characters and relationships that become recurring themes in subsequent chapters.  The second episode at 45 minutes was probably closer to most viewers' attention spans.",1473552000,12,1378,5.066371681415929
