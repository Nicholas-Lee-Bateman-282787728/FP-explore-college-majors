8201781,5,B000ROA08Q,"Bought for our Granddaughter for Christmas...she's getting into ""acting out"" fairy tales: The Three Little Pigs, Hansel & Gretel, etc., so I thought this would be a good one for her.",1417737600,,182,4.903225806451613

8201783,1,B000ROA08Q,"I bought this dvd and a few others by ""timeless tales media"" and am very disappointed.  First of all I mistakenly thought this was the same Timeless Tales by Hallmark from the early 90's - it is not.  However, I think this company ""timeless tales media"" may have wanted customers to be fooled into thinking they were the original videos and capitalize on Hallmark's success.

The story is awful.  Nothing like the original fairytale.",1398816000,,433,4.8108108108108105
8201784,4,B000ROA08Q,"She like this video, she watch it over and over and recite some of the parts in it. It does keep her entertained.",1366329600,,113,3.9565217391304346
8201785,1,B000ROA08Q,"MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVED THE STORE OF THE 3 BEARS, SO I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD DVD FOR HIM TO WATCH,NOT SO. THE ANIMATION IS AWFUL, CHARACTERS WERE UNREALISTIC,OVER ALL JUST A POORLY MADE MOVIE. THE KID NEVER WATCHED IT! WASTE OF MONEY.",1277337600,,246,4.25531914893617
8201786,4,B000ROA08Q,"I agree with Linda's review.  It takes off from the traditional story, and develops it further into a story of friendship.  My 3 yr. old grand-daughter liked it.",1270252800,,161,4.714285714285714
8201787,5,B000ROA08Q,This is a little different than the traditional story. It is a good story and my 3 year old granddaughter is content to watch it frequently. It is a good story of friendship.,1219104000,4,174,4.303030303030303
