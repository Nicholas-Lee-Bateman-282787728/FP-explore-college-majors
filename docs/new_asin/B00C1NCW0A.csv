8576314,4,B00C1NCW0A,"Incredibly harrowing 66 minutes. This felt to me like a pretty realistic imagining of how wildly your life can spiral out of control if you are dealing with a mental illness.
Our hero (JQ) lives in a dingy 4th floor apartment in what looks like a formerly grand building fallen on hard times. One morning while getting ready in the bathroom, he decides (forgets? Forgets he decided to not take?) his medecation. Shortly after that he leaves in a hurry, forgetting his keys.
After a day wandering the immediate (desolate and industrial-feeling) neighborhood and drinking mysterious liquids out of abandoned cups, JQ returns home only to find he is locked out and missing his keys (which hes left inside). He goes back onto the street and spends the next days and nights there.
He seems to be hearing voices and the film ends with him becoming the shadowy figure thats been following him and asking him questions. Also it appears that someone is in his room. Inconclusive ending.",1513382400,,977,4.821428571428571
