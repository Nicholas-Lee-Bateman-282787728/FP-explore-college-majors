8164186,5,B000LUFN5Q,"I like this VHS Tape thought it covered the season thoroughly.  This tape is just 30 minutes not 42 as said on Amazon.  I would like to know the released date of this VHS tape.  The date can't be JAnuary 1, 1993.  The date has to be October 14, 1993 or later.  I first heard of this tape on amazon.

8164187,5,B000LUFN5Q,This is NOT the 1993 Atlanta Braves video that is being sold here.  I would be willing to bet everyone who is selling this tape is selling a Mouse and the Motorcycle tape.  Before your order make sure its not the Mouse and the Motorcycle video first.,1180915200,5,250,4.297872340425532
