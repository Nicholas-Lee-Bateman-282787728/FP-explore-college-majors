8608833,5,B00ES0XBXG,"This three DVD set contains three of the better home workouts available. Each one is very challenging and much harder than a typical workout DVD. Shandi trains in an interval style which makes the workouts go by faster and makes it easier to push yourself to your max since you know you will get a short break between moves. Two of the three (Ballet Box and Tabata) contain intense cardio along with full body toning, while the the third (Mixx) is toning only although you will still get your heart rate up. Ballet Box is one of my favorite exercise DVDs of all time in fact and I have done well over one hundered over the years! It mixes barre toning moves with intense interval cardio and it hits every muscle, including your hips and the front of thighs area which a lot of workouts miss. It gets that all done in 45 minutes too! These workouts burn fat and build long, lean looking muscle tone and are a great complement to workouts such as Tracy Anderson and Fusion Fitness, which have the same goal.",1388620800,6,1005,4.437837837837838
8608834,5,B00ES0XBXG,"I received this DVD as a gift, but it is well worth the money if I were to purchase it or even give it as a gift to someone else! I love the variety the 3 different dvds provide, and I love how quickly they seem to go by. You can really feel each exercise working different body parts. These dvds combine the best parts of so many different workouts, like the stretch and gracefulness of barre and the calorie burn of plyometrics. After completing these workouts I definitely feel accomplished, yet ready to do another one the next day! Another good thing about these is that you don't need very much room, and very little equipment. The equipment you do need is not expensive, and if you don't already have them and can't purchase them right away I am sure you can find substitutes in your house.",1385683200,2,797,4.391891891891892
8608835,5,B00ES0XBXG,"I love this DVD! This really could be the only workout DVD you need since it has three different workouts included. I think my favorite is the Tabata workout because I seem to be motivated by that style...where you know exactly when you will be done with a certain exercise and when you will get a small break, I seem to be able to push through. Not to mention I feel like it makes your workout go by so quickly when you're doing intervals (Tabata focuses on 20 seconds of intense exercises followed by 10 seconds of rest). I really do love all 3 DVDs though, and what's great is that you need very little equipment... mostly a mat (which is optional really), light weights (2-3 pounds), and a small ball for some exercises.

Shandi has an awesome body, so if you can look like her through her DVDs, I vote yes!",1385683200,2,811,4.3355263157894735
8608836,4,B00ES0XBXG,"I first heard of StudioMixx a few months ago on Facebook, and eagerly pre-ordered this set directly from the company.  I've done each of the workouts twice now, and really like this set. It includes three workouts that are a nice introduction to fusion-style workouts, which blend plyometrics, barre, core work, and ballet moves.

To do the workouts, you'll need the following equipment:

*  a mat
*  a pair of 2- or 3-pound dumbbells
*  a pair of paper plates or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gliding-Discs-Individual-Kit-Carpet-1-Pair/dp/B0065V6QJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gliding Discs Individual Kit Carpet, 1 Pair</a>
*  a large stability ball
*  a smaller playground ball (I bought this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Theragear-Pilates-Mini-Ball-Purple-9-Inch/dp/B000I1NJW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Theragear Pilates Mini Ball, Purple, 9 Inch</a>)
*  a chair or ballet barre

The set contains the following three workouts, all of which are led by Shandi Rooney, the creator of the StudioMixx system:

*  Ballet Box -- 63 minutes -- Although this one has ""box"" in the title, there weren't as many boxing moves as I first expected.  It's an hour-long workout that combines interval training with toning moves.  This workout is done barefoot, and uses a mat, dumbbells, the playground ball, and a barre or chair.

*  Mixx -- 56 minutes -- This one is a mix of plyo, barre, and toning.

*  Tabata Sculpt -- 45 minutes -- This workout alternates between 20 seconds of tabata drills and 10 seconds of active recovery.  Instead of focusing just on tabata cardio drills, it also mixes in toning exercises. I was a bit disappointed in this one in that quite a few of the exercises are also in the Mixx workout. This workout is a bit more high-impact, but you can modify it so you're not jumping as much.

As mentioned above, Shandi leads each workout, and there are two background exercisers in each one, one of whom is a modifier.  Shandi does talk a lot throughout each workout (which I know some people don't like), but I find her comments to be motivating and they help keep me mindful of my form.

When I played the first DVD, I was worried that the all-white background would be distracting, but it really isn't too bad once you get used to it.  It also helps you see the form of the exercisers a bit better.

The music is also a bit bland, so I'll probably start playing my own music in the background.

I also wish that the workouts had mirror cueing since it's often confusing to figure out what side I should be on.

When someone asked Shandi about the goals of the workouts on her Facebook page, here is what she said:  ""The workouts all follow the cardio, sculpt, and lengthen philosophy. Intervals of the three concepts will create muscle, use isometric and Pilates exercises to elongate, and cardio intervals so you burn the fat. You can spend hundreds of dollars and hours of working out, but if these three components are not sequenced in the right order, it's not as effective.""

Someone else asked Shandi how/when to do the workouts, and she said these three things:

*  ""[Do] Each DVD once a week for the first couple weeks then try to do each video twice a week.

*  Now, for the workout routine. Hit it hard at the beginning of the week with Tabata Sculpt. Next day it's one of the Mixx workouts(either the new mixx dvd or the Mixx download that you currently have). Ballet Box then followed by Tabata Sculpt again and ending with another Mixx. If you find that your favorite is Ballet Box, which it probably will be, you can Ballet Box twice a week and Tabata once a week. Both are intense cardio.

*  Ideally you will start with ballet box followed by Mixx. Next would be tabata sculpt followed by another Mixx. We have a Mixx download also available on our website which is great too. The idea is hit it hard with the cardio intense workouts, ballet box and tabata sculpt followed by a Mixx workout. If you are doing other workouts along with the Mixx technique, make sure you aren't using heavy weights. We are trying to sculpt and lengthen your body to give you a long and lean physique.""

My plan is to mix these up with some of Sylwia Weisenberg's Tonique workouts (especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonique-Born-to-Move-with-Sylwia-DVD/dp/B00B04KZ5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonique Born to Move with Sylwia DVD</a>) and the two Fusion Fitness Dream Body sets (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Body-Workout-Series-5-DVD-Set/dp/B00BACDFHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Body Workout Series 5 DVD Set</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Body-Cardio-Series-5-DVD-Set/dp/B00EBRWWG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Body Cardio Series 5 DVD Set</a>) for the next month.  This fusion style of workout seems to work really well for my hourglass shape, and I love how these workouts and the Dream Body ones work your entire body, while also really focusing on women's ""problem areas.""  I'll update my review at the end of the month.

If you're interested in trying fusion-style workouts, the price of this set makes it a good introduction.  I personally find the Dream Body workouts to be a bit more fun, but I like the StudioMixx ones, too, and know that I'll be using these a lot!

Hope that helps!  :-)",1378598400,9,5479,5.331781140861467
