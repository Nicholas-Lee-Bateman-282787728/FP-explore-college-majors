8702482,3,B00TP7NT70,"Hollywood cannot undo the mess they made when they made the movie Green Lantern but it is a movie full of digital iCandy that looks fantastic on a Blu ray player on a big screen it's worth the amusement check it out.
Watchmen is a film that suffers the fault of trying to measure up to a popular graphic novel.
 On its own Watchmen is amazing at times and complex, it's beautiful to look at, fun to watch and very thought provoking.
In spite of its shortcomings it may eventually become a classic.
Watchmen is a film that belongs on blu-ray and a big big screen.",1457222400,,562,4.30188679245283
