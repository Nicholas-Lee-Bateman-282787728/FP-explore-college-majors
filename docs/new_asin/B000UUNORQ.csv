Yes, it's a little sophomoric sometimes in its scenes and storyline, but its also such a good and funny movie.  The characters are great, and some people watching it might feel a vague connection to Napoleon Dynamite because of Tina Majorino and even Brian Peterson (who had a VERY small role as the husband whose wife had to have that model sailboat that came with the tupperware package).  And the ending is great, just such a fitting end to everything that comes before it in the movie.  Thought I'd never see it on DVD, but here it is.",1292630400,,685,4.362204724409449
