5392003,5,B00A740FHC,"I watched this series on Drama Fever and then on Hulu Plus. I have always been a History Fan and definitely this series capture the life in XV Century Spain as close as I remember my History Class in School. Intrigues and power struggles, as well as the less known intricacies of these famous royals life, make a credible continuum, stripping the story of any idealization of characters we might have.
During the past year I have been scouting Amazon to find this title and until today I had not been successful. Definitely enjoyed this series and look forward to have them available in our Region 1 format. For me it is a must have.",1404777600,5,633,4.51304347826087
5392004,5,B00A740FHC,"This series is so well done, so professional without all the hbo porn. I had a cursory knowledge of this Isabella and Ferdinand, this filled in a lot of gaps. Of course one must consider some dramatization but it lends such an interesting point of view. I would love to purchase it but it is only in european region 2 format. Now I want to read all I can about her.",1390867200,8,365,4.154929577464789
5392005,5,B00A740FHC,"Drama about the life of Isabel of Castille life. The first season concentrate on her life before becoming queen. Great acting,great plots,as far as I know very close to the real history,this series has my highest recommendation. If you enjoy series like The Tudors,Rome or the Borgias you will definedly like this. Hopefully soon there will be a version for viewers in the U.S.Warning not for children.",1380153600,19,402,5.014925373134329
8547698,5,B00A740FHC,A good interpretation of a great queen's life. No manicheism here. There are good and bad guys but they all have a reason to act like that. It is not GOT. The serie is great to improve your medieval history knowledge and your spanish too.,1515369600,,238,4.311111111111111

8547702,5,B00A740FHC,"One of the most interesting, outstanding series I have ever seen. Beautiful scenery, beautiful costumes, magnificent acting, actors chosen to perfections for their parts and, above all, historical accuracy. I followed the story with the book on Isabel la Cat&oacute;lica that I bought from you, and all the things that happen in the series were true. The only problem: you have to be fluent in Spanish in order to understand it. It has no other languages. But since Spanish is my language, I enjoyed it immensely.",1437436800,,513,4.976744186046512

8547706,5,B00A740FHC,Unfortunately my husband and I only caught the second half on Spanish television. It is a spectacular production that we switched to by accident scrolling through our Latin cable package. I sincerely hope that it will soon be available in US format.  I am counting on Amazon to make this happen. We would certainly buy both seasons.,1417651200,2,332,4.824561403508772
