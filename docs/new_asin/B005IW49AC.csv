4710499,1,B005IW49AC,"Probably serves me right, but after this arrived I didn't get around to viewing it for some time -- or trying to view it.

I'm one who got the out-of-region discs, so I can't see a damned thing on them.

Got it used from cdgiveaways. I suggest you have nothing to do with them.",1376784000,,277,4.111111111111111
4710500,5,B005IW49AC,Hat's off to Billy Connolly for another superb DVD.  This one takes you across America on what is left of the old Route 66.,1364256000,,123,4.125
4710501,5,B005IW49AC,"My husband and I really enjoyed watching Billy Connolly's journey across America on Route 66. It is refreshing to see America from the prospective of a non-american's point of view. We got excited and wanted to take our own trip across America on the ""Mother Road"" after watching Billy's adventures! Thanks Billy, for reviving our interest in touring America !",1362614400,5,360,5.016666666666667
4710502,5,B005IW49AC,"A fun ride on Route 66.  I appreciate this perspective.  As for the negative reviews, they are mostly about the functionality of the DVD's they received, and not the movie itself.",1361664000,2,179,4.741935483870968
4710503,1,B005IW49AC,"Imagine your derelict uncle who lives in squalor with little regard for personal grooming. He litters his mumbled conversations with corny and witless one-liners, with the only clue that humor is intended being that he laughs at his own sorry material.

As is the case of many losers, he futilely attempts to give himself some significance by sneering at virtually everything. Barbed wire was invented to protect water hoarders and create ill will? No mention of it being one of the primary drivers in the advancement of animal husbandry and the development of the west. And, how could those horrid creatures developing the atomic bomb live normal lives when they should be wracked with guilt? If Hitler's team had out-engineered them, this Scottish bum would be goose-stepping around a real job today instead of taking cheap shots at people of accomplishment. And woe be you Americans who revere God, make responsible use of firearms and otherwise exhibit traditional values, because he's got nothing but condescension for you.

Some of the video has redeeming value, although it's heavy on shots of decrepit structures, but the music seems to have been selected by some defective random choice generator. ""Dueling Banjos"" is inextricably linked to ""Deliverance"" and the backwoods culture of the rural southeast. So, they saw fit to use it for an urban cattle auction in west because? And ""Little Boxes"" depicts tract housing of planned communities filled with homogeneous lawyers, businessmen and their pedestrian ""Father Knows Best"" families. So that fits the southwestern architecture of Los Alamos or the all-star assemblage of the top creative scientists, military minds, machinists, etc. in the world? The sound track is inane.

Iconic Route 66 deserves an adventurous seeker, blasting across the country on a hog or open top Vette, not some pathetic clown on a tricycle.",1361145600,2,1878,5.211920529801325
4710504,2,B005IW49AC,"Billy Connolly's look at Route 66 proved way more insightful than one might think- at least from what I could see on the Web. We were taken to places rarely visited in your typical 66 documentaries and we met folks rarely interviewed. I was therefore very disappointed when after a long,long wait the Blue-ray discs were either defective, or not for North America.  The discs load, one can navigate the menu, but there is no access to the programs.",1359331200,2,448,4.670886075949367
4710505,1,B005IW49AC,I waited 2 months for this Blu Ray. Finally received it and tried to play it. It did not work because I was sent a region B dvd that will not play on dvd players in North America. Thanks for making me wait and sending a dvd that I can't watch.,1358467200,2,243,3.784313725490196
4710506,2,B005IW49AC,"I tried it on 5 Blu Ray players and it did not work (both discs).
There was sound but no picture.
I returned it to Amazon.com. This came from an independant supplier
through Amazon.",1347667200,,181,4.352941176470588
4710507,5,B005IW49AC,"Billy Connolly has such obvious affection for U.S. culture that this documentary couldn't fail to be a treat to watch. Starting his journey in Chicago, he takes a leisurely trip through the States on his way toward California, always making time to highlight the many charms of Route 66: not just the obvious landmarks, but plenty of fascinating places that lie just off the beaten track. He really does justice to the wide open spaces, the cultural riches and the engineering marvels of the American past and present. Connolly's enthusiasm is such that if you've never travelled Route 66, this series will make you want to seek out each and every sight for yourself. Not to be missed.",1320969600,12,685,4.813559322033898

8475142,1,B005IW49AC,When I ordered this item back in April I scoured the listing to see if it was the European version.  No warnings so I ordered it and waited for time to sit down and watch it. Now I find out that is a Region B disc and that my window to return it expired a month ago.  But now I see a warning on the listing.  Thanks Amazon.  That was a $46 lesson.,1404000000,,347,3.712328767123288
8475143,1,B005IW49AC,This DVD doesn't play on my blue ray player.  If I hadn't misplaced my  receipt I'd send the damn thing back.  I didn't see anything on Amazons site that said this might not be compatible with my player.  So I guess I'm out $50.,1398470400,,228,4.113636363636363
8475144,1,B005IW49AC,"I  made the mistake of not reading the fine print. It looks as though this disc is from the U.K. and so the format is not compatible with a lot of players in North America. It does not work in my PS3 nor in my friend`s BluRay player. The main menu will come up, but you can not get the movie to play, nor can you play the episodes separately. I recommend making sure you have a player that will play all regions for Blu Rays if you order.",1378944000,2,438,3.9213483146067416
