8634094,1,B00HPUTWLQ,"I personally like Bipasha Basu's fitness regime and I had been working out on her guidelines for quite a few time now. I was streaming her videos  on Youtube so thought of buying this DVD and getting the complete workout. But I was WRONG! This DVD only had videos which are already there on Youtube. Everything else is USELESS. Celebrity interviews are bulls***. I mean why do I need to know how Salman Khan or John Abraham admires Bipasha for her determination. I personally respect her for her efforts but bringing celebrities in everything is just typical Bollywood masala. I mean, guys, this is not a Bollywood masala movie where you put everything in one movie. This is WORKOUT. And people like us are serious about it. So why aren't you guys relevant? Anyways, I returned my DVD back and had to pay for the shipping. So, It was overall a very bad experience! I will recommend streaming her videos on Youtube than buying this CRAP!",1460332800,2,936,4.63855421686747
