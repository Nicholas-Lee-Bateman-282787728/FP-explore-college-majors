Most of the video is black and white but it was informative and captivating. It's very much like a military channel documentary, so if you like that kind of thing then you'll really enjoy this video. My son is 9 years old and spends his time watching the military channel and he's now watched this dvd several times.",1226188800,,419,4.384615384615385
8084270,5,B000BB18UY,"This is one of the really well made videos of avation history, Boeing -Lockheed, Kelly Johnson, well you get the picture. Even shows the early history and pics/videos of the vega, air express, orion..

This one has the pulse of the aviation history buff--certainly worth the price!!

Lots of material and lots of vintage footage..excellent!!",1191715200,2,341,5.181818181818182
8084271,4,B000BB18UY,"The video does a great job of sharing the accomplishments of William Boeing and Alan and Malcolm Longhead (founders of Lockheed). While made in 2005, the 95 minute video does not share much of the industry activities that in many cases shaped the priorities of these three aviation pioneers. For those seeking information about these three aviation pioneers this will be a great video. For those seeking video of events during aviation's golden years, you should also be delighted. For those as interested in the broader industries activities beyond Boeing and Lockheed, the video will leave you wanting more.",1171756800,7,609,5.161616161616162
