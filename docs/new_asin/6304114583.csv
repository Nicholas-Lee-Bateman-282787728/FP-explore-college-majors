790766,3,6304114583,"Three great performances (Rock, Angie, Telly) keep this sexually charged ship afloat, plus some terrific period cinematography.

Rock Hudson especially must be commended for not ""throwing away"" his part in this not exactly career enhancing deal. Vadim's lens closes in on Rock whose expressions sometimes have to carry the sometimes loose and limp script - though it is a notable as strong effort by Gene Roddenberry, with very credible and colorful dialogue.

""Tiger"" McDrew is the High School Football Coach/Hippie Philosopher whose teaching methodology is a bit more (pause) ""hands on"" than some even in the heart of the Woodstock Era. He believes in being extra demonstrative in his communication, let's say, and encourages his favorite pupil, his issued-up but good looking understudy, to pursue special help with Angie Dickenson as the recently divorced but somewhat ""inexperienced"" [apparent] Permanent Substitute Teacher, Mrs. Smith, whose sexuality appears to be limited to short skirts in class and a sense of satisfaction from knowing she is a stone head-turner in them.
It's not clear if McDrew manipulates both parties so as to get her experienced enough for him to accomplish his speedy little interludes in his office with the least amount of romance. Whatever the director and writer were thinking, the mystery actually helps the plotline.
Keenan Wynn plays a ""Campus Cop"" [job title vague] in a role highly reminiscent of his great work in Dr. Strangelove. His by-the-book [of which he never got through the introduction and parts of the index] analysis of the crime scenes at the school is the perfect counterbalance to Police Inspector Telly Savalas' relaxed and rational approach.

Some major lost opportunities in the script for some big laughs and one wierd production flaw. Though McDrew always engages his ""Testing"" red light then locks his door while he...counsels, he never draws those blinds. Okay, if he knows the word is out and h might as well welcome the use of binoculars, what's with the false warning light and lock?",1203033600,4,2050,5.187311178247734
790767,5,6304114583,"A wonderfully goofy dark comedy with Hudson giving a terrific performance.  Interesting to note that not only does the cast have Jimmy Doohan and William Campbell, it was also produced by Gene Roddenberry! I actually saw this when I was in high school.

790768,5,6304114583,"Well, so am I.  I saw this movie at a drive in when it was first released.  Now knowing about Rock Hudson takes a bit of lustre and believeablity out of the movie, but, hey, what did I know (or care) in the 70's?  I found it interesting that one of the songs on the movie was by the (other Jackson 5) Osmonds (Chilly Winds)!  Looking back at it now, the whole movie was pretty ridiculous but it was still entertaining.  I'm glad I found a copy so I could relive my teenage moments...",1172016000,2,483,4.095744680851064
790769,5,6304114583,"Roger Vadim's twisted satire of Southern California and the American education program was a flop on first release, and it was a long time before he dared return to the USA to make another feature.  But today PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW definitely has the hallmarks of a masterpiece, anchored by four brilliant performances.  First off, Rock Hudson in perhaps his last important picture.  He's a little fleshy and with his shirt off the camera seemes reluctant to travel past his navel for fear of exposing some extra weight on his hips.  And Vadim's cameraman (Chuck Rosher, who later did A WEDDING and THREE WOMEN for Robert Altman) hones in on some penetrating closeups which really show up his crows feet--he's lived and that seasons his character.  As usual, he's the men girls want and the man boys want to be, but here it's a deeper and considerably darker version of himself than he ever let people see on the screen.  His ideal married life is something of a sham, or is it?  A cryptic epilogue with Telly Savalas makes us wonder if ""Tiger"" hasn't really the perfect marriage after all.  Vadim needed a larger-than-life star for ""Tiger"" and he certainly got one.

Matching him at every stroke is the young John David Carson, the boy who can't seem to get a date and walks around with a clipboard covering his arousal at all times.  Carson plays ""Ponce de Leon Harper"" as though to remind us of his own perpetual fountain of youth.  Whatever happened to this actor?  He goes from boy to man in a series of believable, subtle segues; and let me tell you, it can't have been easy playing the kid whom Rock Hudson takes under his wing.  Carson makes it all look easy.  It's a graceful, vibrant acting job, like a young James Stewart could have turned in (if Stewart were allowed erections in the cinema of the mid 1930s).

Angie Dickinson has never been better.  She's super sexy, charming, very funny, brainy and extremely elegant, like Kay Kendall, especially in her toga-style hostess gown with the slits in its side that go all the way up her armpits.  These were the Bacharach years for Angie Dickinson, and if rueful acknowledgement of her unavailability, when she first appears, a little Bacharach-like phrase erupts in Lalo Schifrin's playful and ultimately moving score.  Can you imagine being Angie Dickinson at this time?  She had just finished THE CHASE and POINT BLANK, and meanwhile was the inspiration for some of the most stylish and passionate music of the century; no wonder she looks like the kitten with cream on her face.  Vadim doesn't let her drop a beat, even during the scene which every other actress would find humiliating (when Hudson pretends that he's pretending to make love with her, then drops her claiming it was all a pedagogic exercise).  Angie Dickinson just picks herself up and walks away taller than ever.

Finally, Barbara Leigh as Jean McDrew, Tiger's wife.  We had just seen CROSSROADS with William Powell and Hedy Lamarr, said to have been the first film to come up with the ""meet cute"" gambit you've since seen in a hundred pictures, where the guy seems to be meeting the girl for the first time and takes what seems to be alarming liberties with her--and she goes right along with them--and then in a minute or two you realize, oh, they're actually married people, just playing.  Well, Barbara Leigh could have invented this game.  She's as foxy as Hedy Lamarr and, like Hedy, seems capable of actually forgetting the face of her own husband.  Every day must be a delight when you're Barbara Leigh.  By the way if you care about the movies you must read Miss Leigh's autobiography THE KING, McQUEEN, AND THE LOVE MACHINE.

A huge array of young, talented actresses play the victims, girlfriends and fellow students of Tiger, Ponce, and Miss Smith.  People have called this film ""misogynist.""  I don't know.  To me it's like Aimee Eccles (the Eurasian actress who plays Hilda Lee) tells shrewd top cop Telly Savalas in the movie, ""It's all about love.""

Wish I could add a star just for the jaunty theme song sung by the Osmonds, ""Chilly Winds.""  It's demented and you will love it!",1155772800,25,4130,4.699582753824757

This is a rare film and because of the story content it will probably never get release on DVD.  It's a comedy, not a political correct idea that every person is trying to live by today.

One letter stated that Rock Hudson character rape these girls.  Rape?  I would advise this person to watch this movie again.  These girls were enjoying the sex they were having not screaming and yelling for help.

790773,2,6304114583,"It is shocking to look back and see how screwed up America was during this time of ""free love,"" as the concept of this movie would be totally unacceptable now. But the country was 'feeling itself out,' as it  were, and the pendulum always swings a little too far at first.
The movie  is very cheesy, but the most surprising thing about it is how comical Angie  Dickinson is in this role. I do wonder why she chose to play a B movie role  that is so overtly sexual at that point in her career, because I wouldn't  expect to be taken seriously as an actress after this. But this movie is a  moment in time, and has historical significance as part of the swinging  60's-70's era.
Rock Hudson is always good, but Angie Dickinson is  absolutely delightful in this role. Her scene being seduced by Rock Hudson  is classic camp, and her timing is great. She was forty when this was made,  and became a major sex symbol well into her forties. ""Dressed to  Kill"" was made when she was near fifty. Go Angie!",947721600,8,997,4.335135135135135
790774,3,6304114583,"I suppose the '70s promoters of this thing thought there was some sort of serious ""message"" in satirizing the importance of football against the backdrop of sexy coeds being murdered.
I'm a bit of a Roger  Vadim fan since his movies tend to emphasize pretty girls. This movie has  lots of pretty girls, mostly in short skirts. One of the earliest scenes is  a boy walking towards the school as a girl in front of him bends over to  pick up her books. At that time in fashion history, skirts were so short  that girls *never* bent over, except in movies (see ""Smile"").",946598400,8,567,4.466019417475728

Closest I can figure is it's a dark comedy advocating abstinence.  How else do you account for the fact that all of the victims with one glaring exception are promiscuous nubile teenagers?  Sure our nominal protagonist, Ponce (John David Carson), gets deflowered by Angie Dickinson but everybody knows that there has always been a double standard in Hollywood with the boys and girls.  As a thriller it shows its cards much too soon.  I figured out whodunit by reading the back of the DVD case. That said the titillation factor is primary here with the cloak and dagger aspect an afterthought.  Some seem genuinely surprised that Gene Roddenberry would be connected with this enterprise but if anybody remembers the barely there outfits of the female characters on ""Star Trek"" it shouldn't be a shock.

791207,3,6304114583,"First, I saw this as a younger person with my girl at the local drive- in movie lot! It was for its day, titillating as they put it back then. It carried the now defunct rating of ""M"" because it had sexual suggestive plot situations...and the earliest  Hollywood nudity ( topless and/or naked) young women always posed so the shadow or book or plant covered a majority of sins and details. It's sorta funny now, but it was intended to be a black comedy then.
 Basically its the story of a serial killer stalking the nubile young coeds of a California high school, thus the title, as the victims start to pile-up naked in the school, over a few weeks as the police bumble their way through the investigation. The star is Rock Hudson as the school counselor and football coach who counsels numerous cheerleaders and other young ladies in his office during counseling sessions. He's of course suspect number one. Next suspect, senior water-boy and towel manager for the team, and 18 year virgin seeking relief . His name is Ponce- de-Leon...really. Next suspect, substitute English teacher ANGIE DICKENSON, in her first revealing scenes. Guys of my generation will remember Angie...actress wife of Burt Bacharach and future TV POLICEWOMAN. So the story plays out as the audience knows who is guilty, only to be surprised by the end twist.
 For all the innuendo mentioned here, the film is harmless...especially after watching cable TV  for a decade or two. It could easily show on commercial TV today, almost uncut...if anyone wanted to watch it.

That said, I recently purchased this off of Amazon and WATCHED it for the first time. Very few films provide this phenomenon; imagine, seeing a film again for the first time. Once upon a time this was a titilating exploitation film from that guy that created Star Trek, now it's a unique romp of high school sex, corrupted teachers, sexed-crazed serial killer, horny teenage boy experiences sex with a woman and baffled cop (except for Tella Savalas; he was the only person playing this straight) movie. Rock Hudson (not quite believeable as a ladies man), Roddy McDowall (first of two roles as a school principal; the second was in Cutting Class), Keenan Wynn (from Roger Corman's Piranha-1978), Angie Dickenson (From Roger Corman's Big Bad Mama), James Doohan (Scotty from Star Trek; playing a no-nonsense detective) and William Campbell (also from Star Trek; he played the Squire of Gothos and, I believe, Koloth a Klingon; playing an odd detective here).

This is the first of four cult films by Gene Roddenberry (Genesis II, Planet Earth and Strange New World, all failed TV pilots were the others), but by far, the most entertaining.

Is it a sex comedy?

Is it a police drama?

Is it a horror movie?

Just seeing the bath scene with her student as she tries to find the soap, is worth the price alone, not to mention the chocolate duck moment.

Angie Dickinson never looked better and some of the fashions she wears are unlike anything that a school marm would be seen in.

791294,2,6304114583,"Gene Roddenberry co-adapted and produced this 1971 film about an academic advisor / coach who kills a few of the female students he fools around with intimately.  ""Pretty Maids All in a Row"" is ""R"" rated, runs an hour and a half, and stars Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, Roddy McDowall, Keenan Wynn, James Doohan, William Campbell, Barbara Leigh, Gretchen Parsons Carpenter, Margaret Markov, June Fairchild, Dawn Roddenberry, and a few others you might know.  Opening score is performed by the Osmonds.
There is a bit of exploitation (skin) displayed, but nothing eye-popping.  Most of the ""R"" rating is for provocative and suggestive situations, language, or topics of conversation, although 99% is left to the imagination of the viewers.  Some reviewers elsewhere have said there is full female nudity, but upon investigation you will discover it is never a front view.  This archive release isn't uncensored, and there is a lot missing from the original.  I wouldn't qualify anything here as softcore; it is milder than that; bordering on being overly juvenile and mostly just an upskirt tease.  But if you're male, high school age to thirty, and a nerd, this DVD will be your favorite treasure.  Almost as good as watching a young women's high energy aerobics class in a rich part of town.
Angie Dickinson is at her best in this film, but you don't get to see the full monty.  By the way, this film was just as much fantasy and totally B.S. in 1971 as it is today.  Trust me, I'm old enough to know.
Based on the book by Francis Pollini.  This DVD is no frills, no subtitles, no alternative language (just English), and no scene selection chapters to pick from.  No trailer, no stills, no narrative, no commentary, do not pass go, do not collect $200.00.",1339372800,4,1772,4.811881188118812
791295,4,6304114583,"One the few theatrical pursuits of ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry that only die-hard movie buffs remember today, the ""Great Bird of the Galaxy""'s utterly bizarre and irresistibly entertaining 1970 black-comic thriller/high school sex comedy PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW has at last been released on DVD courtesy of the Warner Archive. With a cast comprised of Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, Telly Savalas, Roddy McDowall, James Doohan, Joy Bang and an endless succession of attractive young ladies, how can you go wrong?

In Roddenberry's screenplay (based on a novel by Francis Pollini), cheerleaders are being murdered at a southern California high school, wrapping up awkward virgin (and football team manager) John David Carson in the investigation. There aren't a lot of suspects to go around either, since it's pretty obvious which seemingly ""all-American"" coach (Hudson) harbors a few dark secrets. Thankfully, Telly Savalas' pre-Kojak detective is on the case, leaving most of director Roger Vadim's film to be devoted to Carson's attempts to deal with his sexual awkwardness, emotions stirred up by his gorgeous female classmates and the arrival of new teacher Dickinson on campus.

With that cast and story line, ""Pretty Maids"" is most certainly a cult movie if there ever was one. It's surprising, then, that the movie's only prior video release came in the form of an MGM/UA VHS tape back in the `90s. No laserdisc edition, no DVD - just the occasional airing on Cinemax until Warner's new Archive release, which is now available and offers a remastered, 16:9 presentation of this offbeat, memorable MGM production.

The movie is a time capsule of its period, from Lalo Schifrin's bouncy score to the Mike Curb-produced theme song -- performed by the Osmonds! ""Mod"" era fashions, topless nudity, the bizarre presence of Scotty and the Squire of Gothos as Savalas' investigative team, some big laughs and a quick pace make ""Pretty Maids"" a one-of-a-kind picture that would match up on a neat double-bill with another black-comic high school thriller of its era: the memorable Anthony Perkins-Tuesday Weld vehicle ""Pretty Poison.""

""Pretty Maids"" is a bit all over the place as you might anticipate from the Roddenberry-Vadim collaboration, but it's undeniably fun, managing to work as an unusual coming-of-age piece, thriller and a snapshot of its era all at once. It's long been one of my favorite ""guilty pleasures"" and comes strongly recommended for anyone who finds the subject matter or the cast remotely interesting. Groovy, baby!",1337472000,4,2549,5.224938875305623

791298,3,6304114583,"It's hard to imagine in these times what audience the filmmakers of this unclassifiable foray were trying to target.  It has a murder mystery feel but not enough suspense or hooks to intrigue those fans.  It has soft core sex but not enough spice to appease those types of fans and it shows some really terrific actors looking uncomfortable and grumpy throughout the proceedings.  The film was made by two opposite end of the spectrum filmmakers: Euro-Director Roger Vadim who fared much better with his Bardot/Jane Fonda stints and his underrated ""BLOOD AND ROSES'-1966(C'mon Olive Films , why isn't this out on DVD or Blu-ray?) and the great bird of the galaxy, Gene Roddenberry who not only produced the film but wrote it as well. It's also hard to see Rock Hudson canoodling and having sex with young nubile starlets for a few years later the tabloids would have a field day with his sexual preference announcement.  Angie Dickenson fares a little better although she is just required to flaunt her figure and also seduce our teen hero long before the terms cougar or MILF were used so freely.  Roddy MacDowell, Telly Savalas and Keenan Wynn all stand around grouchy and out of it. In fact, there's a blatantly racist scene between Wynn who's the sheriff and an African American student as he grabs the poor kid and accuses him of being a suspect not even getting to the scene of the crime yet.  You'll also recognize blink or you'll miss cameos from William Campbell and James(Scotty)Doohan.  I purchased this film out of curiosity for never seeing it when first released and missing it in its elusive showings. It seems that Vadim churned out nothing more than a sexually enhanced TV movie which could not have appealed to many film goers at that time or now with its time capsule like look. Warner Archive releases it through Amazon in a widescreen 1.85 DVD-R kind of on the grainy side with no extras or chapter breaks.",1318896000,,1927,4.7343283582089555
791387,4,6304114583,"""Pretty Maids All In a Row"" is a fun, lighthearted high-school murder-mystery, if that makes sense.

The voyeuristic opening credits feature newcomer John David Carson riding a moped taking in all the female pulchritude on his way to school with lots of T&A and upskirt camera shots.

The primary cast reads like a who's-who of '70s crime shows: Rock Hudson is the greasy guidance counselor/football coach sexing up all the cheerleaders. This isn't the button-down Brylcreem Rock Hudson of 1955--here's he's all sideburns and porn 'stache. Angie Dickinson is the sexy substitute teacher with whom Carson becomes infatuated. Telly Savalas is the detective investigating the murders (except here he's constantly sucking a cigarette, not a lollipop). Among the secondary players are Roddy McDowell as the Vice-Principal, wacky Susan Tolsky as his secretary and Keenan Wynn as an inept cop.

A deft mix of campy drama and comedy, there are some unintentionally surreal and hilarious moments here as when Hudson discusses erections with Carson (knowing what we know now, this takes on a whole new meaning), and seeing various naked women throw themselves at him. It's interesting to see how times have changed, as Dickinson doesn't scream sexual harrassment when Hudson slips his hand up her top--in fact, she seems to rather enjoy it. In 2011, Dickinson's predatory substitute-teacher would be jailed for seducing a student, which shows how really sexually-liberated society was back in 1971.

The script does become somewhat predictable but there is a slight twist at the end.

The widescreen print is good, but there are some minor problems here and there and the sound level varies. (NOTE: See the screen-grabs posted in the Images section of this product). For a Made-to-Order DVD there is absolutely nothing bad to say about this release.

""Pretty Maids"" is not really Academy-Award material, but it is quite a fun time capsule of an era when the peace-love-happiness of the late '60s wasn't quite over but Watergate hadn't ushered in the '70s. Avocado and mustard-colored furniture, peace signs and a theme song by The Osmonds. You can't get much more 1971 than that!

This amazing film is finally, officially available on DVD, and in a remastered form! The picture quality is PERFECT. A fine layer of film grain overlays the whole film, and I love it. Obviously, for such a film of this age and budget, there are a few pops and scratches on the print, but in my opinion, those add to the full film experience.

The only downside I can see of this DVD, is that it is a DVD-R, and no special features. A film with such a cult following as this deserves a 2-disc special edition DVD (or Blu-Ray... one can only dream).",1307232000,4,746,4.314285714285714

Just like Meyer, director Roger Vadim was known for having an eye for, ahem, talent, and cast a bevy of beautiful ingenues to be in his film. But unlike Meyer's masterpiece, Vadim assembled a group of A-list actors to be at the forefront of the ""action."" Rock Hudson, Angie Dickinson, and Telly Savalas are marvelous in their roles, giving the fresh faces something solid to play off. The resulting film is not quite as wildly entertaining as BTVOTD, but no less subversive. Another striking similarity to BTVOTD lies in their unusual choice of screenwriter. While Meyer had Roger Ebert, Vadim enlists the aid of the ""Great Bird of the Galaxy"" himself, Gene Roddenberry! TREK fans, strap yourselves in for a journey of a different sort with this one...

PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW is essential viewing for those interested in seeing a prime example of what made the 1970's the most daring period of American film.",1293148800,10,1060,4.72972972972973

791395,5,6304114583,"Gene Roddenberry was a wacky guy.  And I mean that as a high compliment.  After leaving Star Trek, he really let himself go nuts, and we have a singularly wild film as a result.  It's no secret that Mr. Roddenberry had an eye for the ladies and that he embraced the sixties youth movement with enthusiastic abandon.  Freed from the constraints of television, this is the result.  While it never quite decides what kind of film it's going to be, I think that's in its favor... it's a little bit of everything in proportions that you'd never normally find.  I'm not sure it hits any of its notes with total success, but what it lacks in that department, it more than makes up for in sheer chutzpah.  Is it a post-Barbarella, Roger Vadim romp?  Check.  A forty-something's fantasy of what it must be to come-of-age at the tail end of the swingin' sixties?  Check.  Is it a romantic comedy?  Check.  Is it a crime drama about a serial killer?  Check.  A murder mystery?  Of course.  Does Rock Hudson wear what appears to be a mumu?  Yes, again.  Do we have a police team made up of Telly Savalas, James Doohan, and Keenan Wynn?  Yup.  Is it drive-in goodness?  Uh-huh.  Does it get highbrow, with Rock (as Gene's sometimes-surrogate) pontificating on the ills of modern education, quoting Moliere, rappin' with his high school students, and mackin' around like a hepcat Captain Kirk?  Absolutely.  Does a vital plot point involve a frightened teenaged boy backing away from Angie Dickinson and sitting on a booze-filled, chocolate duck statue?  Yes, again.  (What great film doesn't have such a sequence?)  Is it full of awkwardly inappropriate pedagogical conduct?  Oy!  Oh, boyoboyoboy.  Yessireebob.  Do we even see Roddy McDowell praise ""great little cheerleaders""?  Of course.  Gene would not let you down.  It even has a Terry Southern vibe at times, with a Russ Meyeresque love of visual puns.  Yeah, they're often Freudian groaners, but they're in there with unapologetic glee.

It's trashy fun, just as nature intended... with some profound Roddenberrianisms lurking under the surface.  I've shown it to a number of friends over the years, and they all like it.  None of us can explain why, except that, like A GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN, it's the kind of wildly un-PC tour-de-force that you'd never get from a movie today.  Is that a good thing?

791396,4,6304114583,"This was filmed at my high school, University High, in West Los Angeles in the summer of 1971.  I was taking summer classes and remember the distraction of the film crews and actors on the campus, especially the hot-looking maids.  The film begins with John Carson Geekily riding a motor scooter down San Vicente Blvd in Santa Monica, and around the streets near the bluffs in Pacific Palisades. Almost entirely filmed on the University campus, classrooms, hallways, bathrooms. I made some cash as an ""extra"", in the ""Oceanfront High"" Marching Band scene (football field) which was filmed at the Rancho-Cienega Sports Complex at 5001 Rodeo Rd. in Los Angeles. They changed the UH (Uni High)on the shoulder of the band uniforms to OH (Oceanfront High), and on the band hats for the movie. These were the actual school band uniforms, ugly orange and probably from the late fifties or early sixties. The band scene is probably less than 5 seconds.  When school resumed in the Fall, most of the band members wore the ""OH"" on the uniforms as a souvenir.  The movie is very 70's and you can feel it.
