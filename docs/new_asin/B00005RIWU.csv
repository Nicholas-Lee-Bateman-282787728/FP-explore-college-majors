So yes, this behaved just like my other one.  Sit through the title sequence and then the story continues.",1514678400,,262,4.777777777777778
7952529,2,B00005RIWU,"I honestly feel hurt that the creators of arc the lad decided to make one of the most boring dvds possible. This series has just gone downhill though. I have seen all of it except dvd 3, but can clearly point out many problems with it. The series starts out good, a fresh character and his dog to get you going. By the end though, you could probably care less about everyone. This dvd shows how bad you can turn a series with just a few episodes.
You meet up with Clive, that evil guy that is always evil. Apparently he is evil because he likes being evil(that is his entire motivation). He wants to open some box(like the box is crazy and has these mysterious powers like arc) that will turn stuff into demons, or something. Anyways Eliza is just a sub character that really isn't that cool, shes just there for a sappy love story, and Elk's motivation. Elk finally seems to ""understand"" that he needs to stop whining over stuff and just be a man about it. It isn't all that glorious. Anyways, the problem is action. The series does not have enough action and this dvd seems to try to avoid action at all costs. We are gonna see shu and tosh fight together? No, they decide to cut out the fight right before it starts, which is totally stupid, because the fight would have rocked. We are going to see that old dude, merchant, and the drummer boy fight?(i forget the names because the characters were boring) No, they decide to show an explosion and bam cut out of that fight scene too. Ok so we go to this temple thingy. ""Guess what, lots of talking."" This quote I think really captures the essence of that last episode or 2.
Than with like, a flash of light, it ends. What was that? People like die than come back and die again but are still alive? Dude the creators just went totally off topic. Possibly the most idiotic thing they could of done and did do was try to make it a happy ending, yet everyone is shocked at everything. They try to move this thing for the plane and everyone is like, ""Omg can they move it?"" Shut up and help them! Theres always a problem, heres a tip, stop being so shocked at everything and start acting like real people.
In closing, this review is basically to tell you that this series lacks many things, and probably the ending does the series as much justice as evangelion's ending. And if you haven't seen evangelion's ending, it's horrible, confusing, and doesnt explain anything. Its one of those endings where you make your own conclusion, that is why it is bad.",1059609600,,2502,4.382795698924731
