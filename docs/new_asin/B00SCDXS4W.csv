6979878,1,B00SCDXS4W,Had only one disc. Description showed a six disc set.,1431388800,9,53,4.4
6979879,3,B00SCDXS4W,I received my copy in the mail today as well and to say I am disappointed would be an understatement.  This was originally advertised as a six disc set but what I received was one disc with a total running time of 98 min. It's too much of a hassle to return it so I'll keep it.,1431388800,11,277,3.8596491228070176
6979880,1,B00SCDXS4W,Be wary.. I just received and it's only one disc.,1431388800,5,49,4.0
6979881,2,B00SCDXS4W,"I see the cover art has changed BUT the description of the 6-DVD version is still intact so I'm going to keep it all status quo and hoping Amazon sends me the 6-DVD version instead of what's pictured for that price; otherwise, it's going back to them.

Only rating it in this fashion because of the continuous screwups that amazon is causing with this title.",1427414400,6,358,4.507692307692308

8698104,3,B00SCDXS4W,"Unlike other Ed Sullivan DVDs, this program is about 90 minutes long which includes small bits of the unforgettable performances. While I enjoyed seeing The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Jackson Five, Pearl Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald and Ethel Merman among the singers. The DVD program doesn't include the entire performance just snippets. The program is hosted by Carol Burnett who performed early in her career. During the years of the Ed Sullivan Show, you were nobody until you appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show. Even Dolores Gray made an appearance. The Ed Sullivan Theater now hosts the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and previously David Letterman. Apart from their performances, Ed included Broadway performances with the original performers. You can see Richard Kiley in ""The Man of La Mancha"" and Julie Andrew ""The King and I.""

The program is only ninety minutes long with some memorable performances; interviews with Carol Lawrence from West Side Story; Ella Fitzgerald; comedians like Joan Rivers, Alan King and even Jackie Mason. The show began as a variety series called ""Toast of the Town"" and became the Ed Sullivan Show. Ed Sullivan was the first television personality to have a theater named in his honor in New York City. The DVD has a rare interview with Ed and his wife, Sylvia Sullivan.",1529884800,,1300,5.046511627906977
8698105,5,B00SCDXS4W,"This DVD is absolutely great. Its a one disc ""Best of"" the Sullivan Show. I did not want another mammoth collection that takes a very long time to watch, so this more than fit the bill for me. Its a panorama showing what's considered the best moments from Ed's show. It was just enough for me and my wife, and the ending featuring Topo Gigio was perfect.",1434844800,2,354,4.298507462686567
