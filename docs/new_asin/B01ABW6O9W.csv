8746980,5,B01ABW6O9W,"Amazing work to demonstrate the early history of dreams of 2-way television.  Very fine mix of Art and Science.  I would have added that the early Flash Gordon had similar gadgets including TV and laser-like guns.  When I was about 5, I asked my Mom ""Why didn't you name me Flash?!""  Imagine the look on her face.  Now we have it all, but is it doing much Good?",1507420800,,361,4.25
8746981,2,B01ABW6O9W,This review is not about the film but that the film stream that I purchased (SD) which did not contain ANY voice-over with Tilda Swinton! AMAZON please offer the video correctly as it is meant to be seen! WTF?,1494806400,,209,4.384615384615385
8746982,3,B01ABW6O9W,"This could have rated five stars based on its pictorial content. I found the narration to be a little opaque but might make more sense to others. Production values were somewhat lacking - the most annoying to me is that there is no practical way to link a film clip to its source. A massive crawl wlisting all the sources runs at the close, and had it been presented in the included booklet. the viewer could have identified sources on the fly.
The jacket indicates closed captions, but they do not show up in the disc menu, the DVD menu, or the HDMI video. Captions appear only through an analog connection, for decoding in the TV, not the DVD/Blu-Ray player.
This is a must for history buffs, film and otherwise, even though it could have been presented in a more user-friendly fashion. I still recommend it and find it stands up under repeated viewing.",1464048000,3,855,4.558441558441558
