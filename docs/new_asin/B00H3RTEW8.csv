A young man is asked to send computer messages, then something blows up! The authorities investigate. Elsewhere a young couple is disturbed. Lucy, a Rutgers student, has a problem with her father. John McClane is sent to pick up a person of interest in Camden NJ, Matt Farrell. Matt is a computer wizard (and is in unknown danger). Then the shooting begins! Automatic fire, then an explosion! John and Matt escape to a car, then are attacked! The action is unbelievable. The leaders of the conspiracy learn of the failure. Why would they want to kill me? [He knows too much.] Other hackers were also terminated. The criminals use computers to sabotage computer systems and cause traffic accidents.

John and Matt leave their car. The criminals set off alarms across Washington DC to empty buildings. Next its the Wall Street Stock Exchange! Was it a computer failure? There is an unauthorized broadcast that uses parts of old Presidential speeches. That was creepy. A fire sale is a three-way step to sabotage the economy. What is their motive? Code words identify a phony command. There is another attack; they can track the position of the car! [These are all CGI effects.] The criminals control traffic into a tunnel. Their helicopter has an accident. There is another attack on a government building. Total chaos everywhere! The downloads begin. The woman will impersonate an FBI agent.

People from the NSA arrive at the FBI headquarters. There is another broadcast from the criminals with fake news. [What about those who are not connected to the Internet?] Utilities are not connected, they need manual intervention to shut them down. [Wont this affect the criminals too?] There is a scene about computer controlled cars. [Can yours do that?] Two criminals are no match for McClane. But the young woman is! [Believable?] There is cliffhanger action! Matt strikes a blow to help - just in time! The arch-criminal is identified. Our world runs on electricity, it collapses without it. [What about isolated farms with their own generators?]

The FBI wonders how the criminals bypassed security. [A trapdoor in the system to allow unauthorized access?] McClane uses diplomacy to get information on Thomas Gabriel. They connect over the Internet! Gabriel threatens Lucy to get back at John. John and Matt locate the criminals lair and enter. There is conflict. Im coming to get you! Matt knows the code to open a door. He operates the compute but is caught! Gabriel boasts of his efforts. McClane defeats another acrobatic enemy. An F-35 fires rockets and misses. [How good is the equipment paid for by our tax money?] McClane makes another impossible escape. But he is captured. Will the bad guys triumph? It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun. Matt shows unknown skills. Then the FBI arrives to end the conflict.

This is a science-fiction horror movie. This high action movie also has a good story to warn about the misuse of computers (or corporate mismanagement). With all that spying by the NSA why didn't they pick up on this plot? Does the plot remind you of an earlier movie? Was the use of a young couple designed to attract a larger audience? What about the costs to repair all those damaged bridges? But it was all CGI. Imagine if you were in a computer controlled automobile where there was no manual override! WHERE did the money come from to finance this large operation?",1439856000,,3444,4.830508474576271
