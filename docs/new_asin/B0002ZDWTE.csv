2152274,4,B0002ZDWTE,"An old story gets a soft-porn twist in Metzger's 1970 outing.  Some artfully framed sex scenes, Piero Piccioni's catchy, sexy soundrack, and some fun costumes of the period-imagining-the-not-too-distant-furture make the enterprise a cut way above most films of this genre. Production design fans will like it for no reason other than its aesthethic, which recalls Pietro Germi's great TENTH VICTIM of four years earlier (1966). This was Metzger's best foray before Zalman King usurped the genre (you know, TWO MOON JUNCTION and all that jazz). What one should really do though is find the incredible score by Maestro Piero Piccioni (available on Easy Tempo Records). It's a seductive tapestry of orchestral, psychedelic, and organ-funk sounds with a never-ending bass line.
Art...uh, no. Wack, fun filmmaking of its period, most certainly.",958089600,11,839,5.453846153846154
2152275,4,B0002ZDWTE,"Camille 2000 is a tale of a rich Italian businessman, Armand, who falls in love with Marguerite, a rich French Madam.  The story follows the opera ""La Traviata"", which is not new territory for Metzger (Carmen,  Baby), and is based on the Alexandre Dumas story ""Lady of the  Camellias"".  The most interesting aspect of this film is the use of  color, the extravagant costumes, and the photography.  This film has a  reputation as being a sort of ""soft-core"" sex film, but actually  it is very tame compared to many other adult films from that decade.  The  film does have some flaws, such as editing and acting, however it is  visually soothing.  The soundtrack by Piero Piccioni is the best  psychedelic film music I have ever heard.  A good choice for fans of that  ""Peter Max"" look.",945129600,17,784,4.661764705882353

2152281,4,B0002ZDWTE,"In the year 1971 (not 2000) Marguerite Gautier (Danile Gaubert) is a drug using party girl who lives in the manor of the Duke in Rome. Young rich son of a businessman Armand Duval (Nino Castelnuovo) becomes infatuated with her and is warned about her. His friend has other recommendations (I would have taken the young red-haired girl) but Armand is set on breaking his heart and his own destruction. The two indeed hook-up, but Marguerite (not named Camille)  has other lovers.

I liked the retro style. No cell phones, mini skirts, mirrors everywhere, and clear plastic air filled furniture being sheik, but not really practical with all those indoor smokers. Looks like lava lamps and black light posters were for us poor slobs and Peter Fonda films.

As a drama/romance it was pretty much the pits. The acting wasn't there. The plot was not convincing and if the women didn't run around naked/half naked I would have never watched it. BTW more nudity in the outtakes. The restoration was a B+ to A-. There were a few scenes where you could see the age of the film. If you look at the bonus material and trailers, you get a good idea about the original condition.

2152294,3,B0002ZDWTE,"...you must see this film.  It resonates with the experiences of the world from which Edina and Patsy were made in.  The ""mod"" decor, the wild parties, the drugs, the haute couture, the disasters.  No this movie is not a comedy.  It's a completely serious drama which attempts to combine, high art, with a classic tale and throw in some eroticism and... it fails miserably for 21st century audiences.  One simple change would have made this better: ""Camille 1968"" and you remove the pretence that this is in any way ""forward thinking"".  However, I can't fault the creators for believing that it was because, the world was changing quickly and in very large ways in that era.  Compare the worlds of 1950 and 1970 and the differences are as striking as 1790 vs. 1900.

It is possible to watch this film on multiple levels.  The one mentioned above for reference to all the jokes in Ab Fab, and as a time capsule of what people in the 1960s thought was so great about the revolutions of their era that would have a lasting and liberating effect on the world.  You can also watch the very loose interpretation of Camille, although I'd suggest it's not worth it.  Visually the film does some interesting things, but the scenes are far too long and the director is far too in love with his concepts (the multilevel reflection of the couple making love on a glass table over a mirror with a mirror above them, for example).  Truth be told, after the first few minutes, I watched the movie skipping one minute father in every five or ten seconds.  I got through it in about 20 minutes and didn't miss a think since there are long sections with no dialog or real meaning.

Probably the best thing for most young folks to do is stage an MST3K/Cinematic Titanic/Rifftrax style ""riffing party"" and intersperse it with Ab Fab breaks while inventing some sort of drinking (or bath salts since I don't know what ""the kids"" are into these days) game based on the number of times the male lead shows an unenlightened understanding of women.

2152310,3,B0002ZDWTE,"Viewing Camille 2000, made in 1969, in the year 2012 is like traveling through a time warp back to the free-loving, drug-addled Sixties as experienced by the jet set in decadent Europe.  The setting is Rome, appropriately, a city long past its peak as the center of an empire, and populated by an elite whose primary endeavor is immediate gratification.  The story is fairly straightforward: a relatively ""square"" businessman arrives in town and becomes smitten with a beautiful pleasure seeking local woman. Conflict develops; she tries living life his way, then he tries living life her way.  If there is a message, it may be the incompatibility between the old social mores and those of the Sixties.

The most interesting elements of Camille 2000, for viewers in the year 2012, will be the time capsule look back at the Sixties, and the cinematography.  Director Radley Metzger and his crew created some lush sets and costumes, and then used inventive camera techniques to capture some of the most explicit action, such as filming reflections and changing focus in sync with a character's breathing.  Some of this may come across as cheesy to a current-day viewer, and certainly there is much more explicit action filmed these days in graphic close-up, but as a portrait of the times Camille 2000 has its appeal.

Daniele Gaubert is at the absolute pinnacle of female beauty in this movie; she is simply a joy to behold.  Whether it was a facial close-up or a full-body shot in a crowded room, she fully captivated this viewer's attention.  More than a few times we get to see her in the altogether, and one would be hard pressed to find a single flaw anywhere on her.  As for her acting, I would term it adequate for the role.  The physical attributes of her character are the greatest challenge in the role, and here she succeeds beautifully.

I don't think Camille 2000 is going to land on anyone's Top 100 list of all-time great movies, but European cinema buffs and those seeking a flashback to the Sixties should find it amusing.",1355788800,,2038,4.7749287749287745

2152312,5,B0002ZDWTE,"A powerful story and a great cinematic experience, Metzger was at the top of his game in Camille 2000.  But this movie goes deeper than most on this topic.

You probably already know the story line -- a beautiful ""jet setter"" bought and paid for by a very rich count hosts frequent parties dedicated to the hedonism she so passionately pursues.  She meets a man and they fall in love for a summer.  Then the romance ends unexpectedly.  The next few weeks and months are a predictable series of chance meetings at various parties where the couple attempt to be unaffected by the other while doing things to intentionally hurt each other.  It seems the couple themselves are the only ones who cannot see the clear and obvious love still smoldering between them.

But this story goes much deeper than a simple summer romance about love won and then lost.  All through the movie it is clear that this large cast of ""the beautiful people"" is nothing more than a group searching for real meaning in their lives and not finding it, resulting in the predictable substitution of physical pleasure for real meaning.  We have all done it on some scale - not finding what we truly want so we settle for what we think we want or for what we believe is the best we will find.  And history suggests that sensuality is the most effective substitute for real meaning.

As for all of us, sensuality works for a while for our central couple.  But the truth seeps in no matter how badly we want it to stay out.  It seems that the love our central couple feels for each other cannot withstand the forces attacking it.  Then hurt, anger, and even bitterness becomes their constant companions.

Yet Metzger gives us so much more than this common and tragic story.  He makes us long for the happiness our couple so deeply desires.  He makes us want to step into the story, take them by the hand, and help them discover, perhaps again and again, the joy of unselfishly giving ourselves to another.

This is a rich and powerful story of rich and powerful people seeking love and passion in a large and lavish context.  The characters are the exaggerated caricatures we would expect in this type of story.  Yet they seem so real and their conquests and pain become our conquests and pain so easily.  I believe most of us will be able to identify with this couple entirely too well.

And while this movie is all about sensuality, the nudity and sex are more subtle than obvious.  The women's outfits are ingeniously revealing but give the hint of nudity rather than the reality of it.  There are a number of breasts in the film, and they are very beautiful breasts, but this is clearly not a skin-flick.  If you are looking for porn, hardcore or even softcore, you need to keep looking.

But if you don't mind a little nudity in a story so poignant, then this will be a great addition to your library.",1323561600,19,2873,4.508704061895552

2152315,5,B0002ZDWTE,"[CAMILLE 2000 (Extended Version) -(1969)- Directed by Radley Metzger - Widescreen Presentation] Loosely based (and I do mean loose) on the classic Alexandre Dumas story, 'The Lady of the Camillas' - one of the few times a filmed erotic re-creation of a traditional title actually works without embarrassment - Radley Metzger finally actualized his attempts at merging arthouse sophistication and eroticism. This film, along with 'The Lickerish Quartet', stands proudly above his other work in the 60's, though no one can ever accuse him of not over-reaching in previous attempts. I personally found 'Score', released around the same time, to be a sordid, second-rate take on 'Bob and Carol, Ted and Alice' that never hit its mark (impoverished acting might have had something to do with it) but, in this instance, Metzger got the brass ring he so desperately sought and deserved.

The tale of a beautiful but self-destructive woman named Marguerite (captured by the striking Daniele Gaubert, who had appeared in about 20 films prior to this), whose addictions to drugs, sex and money are the focal point of most of the film, who later falls in love with an aristocratic young man named Armand (Nino Castelnuovo of 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg') she meets at one of the notorious soirees she regularly threw at her villa for hip jet-setters and the extravagantly rich at the end of the late 60's - certainly a fantastic time to be either. Though she is kept by a grand Duke, has a host of other lovers and attends all the glamorous parties of the decadently entitled, her love for Armand leads her to run away with him on a yacht so they can concentrate on each other. Soon enough, Armand's controlling father (Massimo Serato) enters the picture, intervenes in their happiness and Marguerite soon reluctantly returns to the reckless lifestyle that will ultimately consume her.

The actors attractive and accomplished, the exotic locations rife with lush scenery and the immodest trappings of the rich, the orgiastic parties and partner-swapping while consuming intoxicants of all kinds make those in 'Beyond the Valley of the Dolls' look like parent-teacher conferences, this is the ultimate spectacle of extravagance and indulgence one could ever imagine (and Lord knows I have). If you like your erotica elegant, esoteric, laced with beautiful people and unencumbered by all the unnecessary paraphernalia of plot development and depth, this flick is for you (and I mean that in the best way possible). It's an inspired spectacle of over-indulgence on all levels.

The truly unsung star of this film is unquestionably Enrico Sabbatini, who presided over sets and costume designs for the production, which are partially responsible for the success of the film. In addition to some of the most fantastic female form-flattering see-through outfits I've ever seen or salivated over, the interiors are comprised of futuristic yet undeniably 60's outlandish furnishings one could imagine - sheer visions of excess. Dramatic inflatable furniture, Lucite walls, bedposts and costume accessories, plastic and glass this and that, mirrored walls with deco frames, vinyl bedsheets, mesh bathing suits and cocktail gowns, chain-metal and feathered accents on almost-there female garb, multi-layered light boxes - if it existed in the late 60's, it's proudly and properly placed here. It sets the stage for everything that's encompassed within, creating an almost otherworldly setting for the events displayed, and is nothing short of fantastic. (He should have been presiding over the set of 'Barbarella').

The video and audio are rich, crisp and vibrant and the widescreen presentation allows for basking in the lavish settings. There are solid, bonus featurettes narrated by Radley Metzger, along with a deleted strip-tease, an alternate love scene, etc. As John Lennon said in a song lyric, ""How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?""  For most of us, this is about as close as you can get...",1315353600,38,3993,5.184496124031008

2152317,5,B0002ZDWTE,"This was the first film that a) introduced me to the films of Radley Metzger and b) introduced me to the erotic film genre.  I was working as an usher in a movie theater during my high school years and this was my first X-rated movie experience.  It played on a double bill with Pasquale Festa Campenile's 'THE LIBERTINE' but 'CAMILLE' was the standout. At 15 years of age, I had yet to see a film by Fellini and more European horror or genre films.  What I loved about 'CAMILLE' was the technicolor images, the fantastic pop jazz music score by Piero Piccioni and the two beautiful actresses Daniele Gaubert and Erika Remberg.  People were coming to the theater and being disappointed that the film was not hard core enough for an X but this was 1969 and even the soft core genre was not established yet,at least in my town. Metzger was a genius in photographing  the male and female form to the point of taking it beyond the pornographic image.  This film made such an impression that I tried to see every film by Metzger but I was too young to get into the theater( I did sneak in to see 'CARMEN BABY' ) and over the years I have seen all of his films but 'CAMILLE 2000' was and always will be his true masterpiece in my eyes. Adapting the Camille legend to swinging Sixties Europe , Metzger weaves his tragedy with outstanding set pieces which still dazzle the eyes .  The quality fluctuates with scratches appearing at the reel changes but the exuberant technicolor is still there .  Kudos for First Run Features for preserving this beautiful time capsule of erotic cinema for the ages, I'm sure Camille would have approved. Enjoy it for its beauty and nostalgia.",1277078400,,1668,4.5
2152318,4,B0002ZDWTE,"I have had this set for about four years.

Radley Metzger was one of the first arthouse pioneers of explorations deep into human sexuality in the 1960's and 1970's.

I agree that by Holywood standards the sexual exploitation is mild.  However, those viewing these films (especially Therese & Isabelle) soley for their titilating content are overlooking the deep psycho-sexual themes in these films.

Therese and Isabelle, for instance, is one of the classics that still guide women exploring their sexuality well into the twenty first century.  It is a very, very tender portrayal of a young woman's coming of age, and, her deep needs for love and self-acceptance.  (It is the only film adaptation of Violette LeDuc's candid and, for the time, sensational auto-biography of the same name).

Camille 2000 is a brilliant remake of Daniel Defoe's ""Camille"" set in 20th century Italian culture (for the 1960's and 1970's).

The ""Alley Cats"" is one of the first films that exposed, for modern audiences, the once forbidden realm of prostitution and its prominence in our culture (despite its suppression).

The transfer is terrible. It's full of scratches and it's out of focus or taken from a very old film stock. It's truly terrible and felt that I was ripped off because DVDs today have a certain standard for image quality which this one obviously disregarded. It's not worth paying for this.

Nice to have them in boxed sets like this though I must let Metzger fans know that the transfers from First Run are not as good as the Image versions. Where the Image versions are color saturated and sharp, the First Run transfers have murky, faded out color and soft pictures.

Still, for the price, these boxed sets aren't a bad buy.",1115078400,15,397,4.591549295774648
2152325,3,B0002ZDWTE,"CAMILLE 2000

(USA - 1969)

Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

During a visit to Rome, the romantic Armand (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a promiscuous young Countess (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed by Castelnuovo's wealthy father (Massimo Serato), and Fate deals a tragic blow...

A sexed-up love story for the swinging Sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas' 'La Dame aux Camellias') by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with cinematic flair by Radley Metzger who, along with Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno (amongst others), is credited with redefining the parameters of 'Adult' cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), though the film's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards.

Production values are handsome throughout, and while the actors are slightly hamstrung by post-sync dubbing, the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable). Though set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period, and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of Metzger's brand of elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed.",1058486400,5,1518,5.699115044247788
