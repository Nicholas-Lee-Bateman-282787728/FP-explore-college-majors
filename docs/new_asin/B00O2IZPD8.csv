6704150,5,B00O2IZPD8,"It's about time Disney returns to it's classic values! This is the best Family movie I've seen in years! No ghoulishness, no explosions, no wanton violence. In fact no violence at all! Not even one gun or explosion, yet a captivating movie with imaginative special effects that only Disney could dream up! Up until now, I've become tired of Hollywood constantly trying to do themselves one-better by redoing movies for the simple reason of adding more violence and bloodletting. NOT this one. I recommend it for ALL viewers.",1426377600,4,524,4.965909090909091
6704151,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Congratulations to Disney for putting forth a high-quality live action fairy tale.  The casting is perfect, the pacing is great and didn't leave me bored at any point, and the few additions to the fairy tale were extra incidents which didn't change the course of the story.  The story is very much the traditional story, and takes advantage of its feature-length format to develop characters, which makes it a more powerful movie.  Lily James plays Cinderella with more character than I thought possible.  Cinderella in this movie is an optimist, but she struggles at several points with sadness and anger about being mistreated, and always looks to the memory of her kind deceased parents to assure herself that her stepmother and stepsisters are wrong about her.  Because we see how she handles her emotional struggles, not just when shes not allowed to go to the ball but through a series of incidents before that, this version of Cinderella rises to the level of a serious drama.  I think because the characters emotions feel more real, due to the time being well spent on character development prior to the ball, theres a palpable excitement which flows through the movie starting at the point the fairy godmother appears.

I appreciate the conscious attempt to instill valuable character qualities through this movie.  Cinderella speaks several times about the important of kindness and courage, the two principal virtues she aspires to, and initiates an I forgive you to her stepmother toward the end.  She is a paragon of virtue, demonstrating kindness throughout and exercising courage by standing up to her stepmother when her stepmother has a plan to manipulate the prince.  The screenplay keeps having her talk about kindness and courage but somehow doesnt feel preachy.  I like that it explains Cinderella becoming so subservient to her stepsisters and stepmother because she is trying to distract herself from grief over the loss of her father.  Her stepmothers motivation is also made clear:  shes mad at the world because she lost two husbands.  It also shows how Cinderella got her good character from having nurturing parents before living with her stepmother and stepsisters.  While the original fairy tale struck audiences because of the rags-to-riches plot, because of Europes social class structure, this movie feels to me like its more focused on the idea that Providence/Fate/Justice/God will honor the humble and we just need to be kind and courageous.

Cate Blanchett does an excellent job as the stepmother, who starts out unhappy and demanding but becomes more sadistic and vicious over time.  The stepmother and stepsisters are not as ditsy as Ive sometimes seen, and their outfits at the ball look more like people trying too hard to look rich than completely gaudy or buxom or boorish.  The movies attempts to mix characters who feel real with the fairy tale genre work really well.  Also, the prince, played by Richard Madden, is an attractive match for Lily Jamess Cinderella.  They are both very genuine and respectful to each other.  (One side-note about the casting:  It was a little distracting to me seeing black people playing characters at the palace, since that would be atypical for Europe (even though there were wealthy black people in Europe in that era).  Im sure Disney would get harshly criticized for leaving out people of color if they didn't include them, even though its a 1600s-1700s European setting.  At least they're appealing characters even though they distracted me visually.)

I think this must be the first live-action fairy tale Ive seen that affected me on the level of a serious drama.  Im very pleased with the artistic, casting, and story decisions and hope this movies Cinderella character will be relatable enough that she will be a role model for young girls and young women, and maybe even other people.",1426377600,83,3873,5.031347962382445
6704152,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Kenneth Branagh's latest adaptation of the classic fairy tale is a sweeping, lavish and beautiful production. Unlike so many of the fairy tale themed movies of the last few years, this version of ""Cinderella"" is a straightforward, traditional retelling. It takes itself seriously. It's also a breath of fresh air for that very reason. Instead of fluffing the story with unnecessary forced plot lines,complicated back stories, villians that are are just misunderstood (boring)... Branagh's ""Cinderella"" is the story everyone knows, and it is told exceptionally well. This is a superb film for families and people of all ages. I can't imagine any boy, girl, man or woman NOT finding something enchanting about it.
  Lily James is perfect as Cinderella, bringing a sweetness and innocence to the character that is at once sympathetic, and yet always bold and determined. Cate Blanchett is equally wonderful as Lady Tremaine, every bit as mean and vile as a Disney villain should be, while clearly hiding some pain of her own . I don't even know where to begin with the production and costume design...it is breathtaking. Someone in some department will likely be taking home an Oscar next year. The soundtrack by Patrick Doyle is very beautiful, as well. It is difficult not to get at least a few butterflies when the music swells and Cinderella's dress turns to a ravishing gown.
 I have to say, I didn't expect this to be as good as it is. I really didn't. I've found most of Disney's work these last few years to be extremely underwhelming (including Frozen and Into the Woods). This changes everything! I think it's important to note that the film never gives the impression that Cinderella just needed a prince to be happy. It's made clear that what she needed was to be allowed to be herself. I was very happy to see that. While nothing can ever replace Disney's original animated film, this is far and away the best live action version I've ever seen. See it on the big screen if you can. It is so worth it.",1426377600,382,2011,4.772988505747127
6704153,3,B00O2IZPD8,"This is a beautiful film - or it was six months into production planning before somebody said ""Its OK, but it needs MORE!"" for the third time.  Over-produced to the max as most late model Disney products are, filled with manipulative sentimentality,a catch phrase moral, no real heart or humor or true character, it is a film meant for unquestioning minds already accustomed to empty glitz and suface gleam  of a good deal of modern children's ( and adult) entertainment.  It is easy to see its product potential - DTV sequels, TV series with toy, costume and  music CD tie ins, etc,etc,etc.

Many will love it, I do not.  I dread the same treatment scheduled for Beauty and the Beast.  I will retreat with my cartoons and memories and leave Corporate Manufacturing Disney to those who can appreciate it.  Walt liked to make a buck, but he cared about story and innovation, too.  And true artistry not just bloated budgets.  Its a brave new world but its not for me.",1426291200,11,966,4.629411764705883
6704154,4,B00O2IZPD8,"I went into the theater desperately wanting this movie to be good but I did not keep my expectations high because the recent Cinderella movies created after the original Disney animated film have been sub par. I decided to give this movie a try though after being impressed by what they did with the story of Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent and I thought it was a beautiful display of altering a story to make a better message with a classic tale. I kind of expected that they might do the same with this one but in the end the movie actually ended up being the classic Cinderella story with live action work.

Although there were no new twists and turns added to this story, Director Kenneth Branagh did a great job of making the movie down to earth as much is at can be even with the magic and fairy god mother aspects to it. I thought that it was a great choice to add Branagh as the director for he has previously directed numerous Shakespeare plays and have had experience with directing stories that take place in the olden times. The man knows how to direct films of this genre and it clearly shows.

The actors themselves did a great job in their performances. The cast ranges from Helena Bonham Carter to Kate Blanchett and even the character who played Robb Stark in the HBO TV Series Game of Thrones. The parts were well casted and they gave solid performances. Kate Blanchett and the actress who played Cinderella Lily James in my opinion did stellar performances and you can tell that Lily James will definitely be showing up in future motion pictures.

As for the appeal of the movie, I didn't learn anything new that I had known already from the previous Cinderella stories but this was well executed and will appeal to a new generation of children. I applaud Disney for not screwing up the story with a remake and the fact that even though they kept the original story, it was still executed well enough for me to enjoy the film. This movie is BengirlxD approved especially if you are a Cinderella fan or wanting your children to go see this movie.",1426291200,3,2064,4.498666666666667
6704155,3,B00O2IZPD8,"In Walt Disney Studios' big-budget and largely faithful new live-action update of corporation cornerstone Cinderella, the form shines more than the content.  The storyline is well-known and, a few diversions and flourishes excepted, honored here:  once upon a time in an unspecified kingdom, protagonist Ella's childhood idyll gives way to perilous domestic blending and ashen-faced servitude in a whirlwind of parental death until her fairy godmother spirits her to a luxurious ball where she can dance with the dashing prince.  Kenneth Branagh directs this version with a level of detail-oriented pageantry reminiscent of his masterful and momentous adaptation of Hamlet two decades ago.  The camera glides and spins, and the opulent flair of the frame-enveloping art directionthe fabric!  the furniture!  the paintings!  the sculptures! is outmatched only by the evocative and luxurious costume design, ranging from the malevolent stepmother's severe-chic wardrobe (vile at heart, but astonishing in emerald green) to Ella's central ball gown, a cerulean and crystalline spectacle hypnotic in motion.

Branagh has also convened a fine cast.  Two-time Academy Award champion Cate Blanchett is invited to pose, glance with murderous intent, and exude a general, delicious, just-shy-of-camp air of the diabolical.  She is fun, but the fresh-faced and relatively inexperienced Lily James may have a harder role.  Since this is not a revisionist film, her Ella, as a heroine, must swing widely around any hint of the prefix ""anti-.""  She must not rage against either her tormentors or her circumstances.  Instead, she can only quietly cry in private and register as an earnest, heartfelt martyr who believes it impolite to object to inequity.  ""Forgive them, Fairy Godmother, for they know not what they do!""  Within such confines, James delivers a charming performance.  She is subtle, but animated.  There is an authentic sense of wonder in her eyes, and hers is a great, yet still down-to-earth beauty.

So why does this film, well-designed, well-shot, and acted by a capable ensemble, not soar as it should?  It is hard to say.  Perhaps it is too picture-perfect, practiced and safe.  The intended lows of the dramathe death of various parents, the abuse of Ella in the domestic spherenever sting, and the intended highs of adventure and romance register as elementary and preordained rather than alive, dangerous, or sexy.  A few of the detours from traditional Cinderella lore are undernourished, including the political subterfuge of a modestly dastardly grand duke played by Stellan Skarsgrd on autopilot.  At the end, despite the various delights on display (sartorial and otherwise), it is hard to not to shrug and say, ""Yes, this certainly was Cinderella"" and forget much of the experience on the way out.",1426291200,14,2814,5.345454545454546
6704156,5,B00O2IZPD8,Disney has done it right once again!,1426204800,3,36,4.285714285714286
6704157,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Overview: What I enjoyed most about the latest ""animation to live-action"" treatment, is that it's a relatively straightforward telling of the classic story that we grew up with. While Alice in Wonderland, The Sorcerer's Apprentice and Maleficent were unnecessary re-imaginings of their animated predecessors, Cinderella is retold respectfully and refreshingly for the new generation. The previous live-action films were all about style. They lacked substance and, unfortunately, heart. Cinderella, however, has style, substance and, most importantly, heart. I genuinely believe that Disney did something right by keeping the magic alive in this film. While most people were probably expecting a sword-wielding action hero, I'm happy that Disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect. If Walt Disney himself were alive today, I'm sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little saviour be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way.

VIDEO: The film is presented in a stunning 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 format with an 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It appears as though DNR has been applied to get rid of some of the grain to give the film a more glossy, digital look. I have the LG-60PA650T and the video quality is absolutely beautiful. The two scenes that stand out is the dress transformation and the first dance at the ball. The colours just explode!

AUDIO: The film is supplied with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 lossless soundtrack. It is here where Disney allows the viewer to enter the world of Cinderella. You can appreciate Disney's effort to make even the smallest of sounds audible. I have the Sony Muteki 7.2 Home Theatre System and there are no words to describe just how amazing the audio quality is. The scene that stands out is the midnight chase sequence. Cinderella is also available to listen to in Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish in a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. English Audio Descriptive for the visually impaired is included in a Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack.

SUBTITLES: There are a handful of subtitles (English, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian, Swedish, ect.) included for the hearing impaired and for those who may have missed a bit of dialogue in the theatre.

MENU: The interactive menu consists of footage from the Teaser Trailer and a couple of scenes from the film.

SCENE SELECTION: There are 18 chapters with titles provided for each one.

BONUS FEATURES: The Blu-Ray contains six bonus features including four featurettes, an alternative opening with an introduction by Kenneth Branagh and the Frozen Fever short which debuted ahead of Cinderella in early 2015. There are six never-before-seen deleted scenes with an introduction by Kenneth Branagh that are exclusive only on Disney Movies Anywhere.

Recommendation: Having seen Cinderella a ridiculous amount of times in theatres, I was genuinely looking forward to watching the film in the comfort of my own home. I genuinely believe that Disney's Blu-Ray release will prove to be a delight, thanks to an outstanding Video and Audio presentation. There aren't many special features on the disc unfortunately, but the deleted scenes on Disney Movies Anywhere make up for that. Cinderella is retold beautifully and is strong enough to stand on its own. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1426204800,223,5516,5.211299435028248
6704158,4,B00O2IZPD8,"From the director of  A Mid-Winters Tale and Marvels Thor comes the live adaption of one of Disneys most precious fairy tales. The film stars Lily James as a young girl named Ella, who after losing her parents and being brought in by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters, runs into a prince in the outskirts of the village. When a ball is announced for all to attend, Ella does everything she can to meet the prince and find love for the first time. This Disney property co-stars Cate Blanchett, Richard Madden, and Stellan Skarsgard.

There was very little publicity about Disneys new project that saw a mini teaser trailer with little to give away. I was a little skeptical about Cinderella because of how little press the movie received yet was doing good by critics. So after watching the film I have to say it was really well put together and a rather enjoyable watch. What surprised me most was how they were able to put together a full length film for such a short tale. And one of the things I enjoyed most was the performance by Lily James. She was amazing as Cinderella who came off as sincere and caring and was someone you cared about.

One thing that was really effective was how they made the characters of Ella and the Prince almost alike in how they lost their parents. Richard Madden plays the prince whos on the lookout for a princess when he runs into Ella in the woods while hunting. Its there when they have their first encounter and is when their journey begins. And with Madden I liked how your able to feel for the guy and also care about him just as much as we do with Ella. Many times film focuses so much attention on one side of the coin and doesnt balance out with the other characters. Here its done brilliantly with great chemistry between the two. When the film does come to its eventual conclusion your even curious as to what happens to them after and where their lives are headed.

This leads us into Cate Blanchetts performance as the stepmother who is widowed by Ellas father. She did a great job in playing the evil stepmother who wasn't over the top like we would see in other Disney movies. The writers gave her a respectable role that was mature to the audience who sometimes came off as intimidating. You couldn't even tell she had an ounce of cruelty because of how settle her mannerisms were up until Ella and her spoke about the living arrangements. We have to mention the two idiotic stepsisters who were fun to laugh at just at how dim witted they can be. No big to do about their roles but only to service the film and had succeeded for what they were for.

I mentioned this before that the pacing of the film as it followed the fairy tale was done very well. Almost every detail in the story came scene after scene without ever slowing down. Director Kenneth Branagh did a great job in making this movie and it shows he put time and effort into making something special. We get to see the fairy godmother, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who for a brief cameo helps Ella become a princess for one night as she desperately wants to go to the ball. The whole sequence of the pumpkin changing along with the mice and lizards were incredibly done to then complete the horse carriage  for Ella to ride the night away. That element of magic in a movie where its hardly recognized added a nice touch to the viewing experience.

It may not be a movie that Id personally purchase on Blu-ray but is definitely worth a watch for anyone whos curious. From the special effects to the story weve come to grow up with, Cinderella is a mature movie that will surprise many in the end. Again, without saying, Lily James was amazing as Cinderella who with the help of Richard Maddens performance as the prince were the strong points of the movie as a whole. Make sure to stick around for the very start of the movie as Disney introduces another short film involving a much beloved movie in Frozen.",1426204800,18,3929,4.448611111111111

6704204,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Where do I start!  This is, by far, the best live action movie Disney Studios has put out.  We play it pretty much daily and love it as much now as when we first watched it.
Lily James is a wonderful Cinderella.  Innocent, caring, seeing the best in everyone.  Her ball gown is every little girl's dream! Pouffy, flowing, swirling like a dream.  Cinderella seems totally taken aback to be dancing with the prince complete with small gasps of delight, cute giggles and trills of amazement.
Richard Madden is a handsome, gentle Prince Charming (Kit). His chance meeting with Cinderella in the woods, his evening with her at the ball, his determination to find the ""Mystery Princess"".  Again, every little girls image of her dream Prince.
Kate Blanchett is a wonderful wicked step-mother!  What she can do just by shifting her eyes, raising her head., subtle change in her voice. Wonderfully nasty!
2 step-sisters and a fairy god-mother round out the fun.
The animated animals are spectacular!  So real and fun!

6704276,4,B00O2IZPD8,"*spoiler alert* The story begins when a little girl named Ella befriends some deer mice and her mother encourages to keep them as friends and that she can speak with animals.  The mice never do speak but exhibit strangely human behavior and act as if they understand Ella.  Later, the mother contracts the hentai virus from the mice her daughter keeps.  Before she dies, Ella's mother reminds her to never let her enemies get in her way.  Ella promises this to her mother on her death bed.  Years go by and tiny Ella grows up and all the while keeps her pet mice.  Curiously, the human behaving mice are still alive and live well beyond the 3ish year life expectancy for the common mouse.  Finally, Ella's father grows more depressed and lonely and picks the first widow with 2 daughters he finds.  Later, Ella's father begins to grow tired of his new wife and admits that while she is probably behaving exactly as she did before he married her, he somehow finds her lavish lifestyle burdensome. He plans a long business trip to get away.  On the business trip, he gets sick and dies.  Probably from hentai virus he picked up from the mutant mice that live too long that Ella has been keeping around.

With the death of the father, the family is now ""broke"".  They still never work a day but somehow have money for lavish clothes and meals.  Ella learns what it was like to be a servant, the same type of servant that took care of her household, and she laments at her hard life as she was previously living a life of bliss but was now condemned to blue collar work.  She goes on a horse ride one day and becomes vegan and also meets a dashing young lad who lies to her up front.  She also lies.  They realize they have complimentary immune systems which will guarantee strong offspring.  However, eager to not expose their mutual lies, they separate and go on their merry ways.  The young lad, who is the Dictator's son, becomes obsessed with the lying vegan who has a complimentary immune system, Ella, and pleads with his Father Dictator to open the club to the unwashed masses. The Dictator agrees.

As Ella and her step mother and step sisters get ready for the club, the step mother doesn't want the lying vegan with murderous, disease ridden vermin to go.  (The mice are still alive)  Ella pleads but is unable to go after her depressed step mother (she's lost 2 husbands now and the second thought she was boring, who wouldn't be depressed??) ruins her mother's vintage gown.  Her step mother proclaims Ella will always only be a blue collar worker and is too unwashed to join the unwashed masses at the club.  As the step mother and sisters leave for the club, Ella dashes outside, kneels before the fountain and devotes her soul to satan and we realize why the mice have lived so long: Ella is a witch and the mice are her familiars.  Satan sends his minion, an old hag who completes the final details of the contract with satan.  Ella will become queen and have all the riches of the land in exchange for her soul.  Ella agrees.  Ella goes to the club in extreme style and continues to woo the Dictator's son who is still obsessed.  After the party at the club, the step mother realizes what is happening and learns about the contract Ella made with the devil and she tries her hardest to prevent the evil plan from coming to fruition.  Sadly she fails, the dictator dies, and the step mother and her daughters are banished from the country. Ella marries the new Dictator and the country falls into darkness.

6704279,3,B00O2IZPD8,"Wonderfully acted, great chemistry. Basic writing. Cinderella the mythology has some wonderful esoteric interpretations that deal with self-esteem, owning who you are and being a good person.

But truthfully I only watched this for Kate Blanchette. I was annoyed because not only is this exactly the same story we've always seen but in doing so it makes it blaring my obvious to me that growing up was that I was supposed to wait for someone else to rescue me. Unfortunately still waiting on Prince charming but all my improvements have come from yes being a good person but also TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.

Also as a growing woman I find that I gravitate towards the evil step mother for the simple fact that she is active and has strength. In the real world unfortunately many ""cinderellas"" never stop being Cinderella and they go on to find husbands who are just as bad if not as bad as their Evil step mother. Honestly I would prefer to see a movie about the stepmother.

Little girls will love it because it will be new to them and yes, a fairytale. But I do believe it sends the wrong message.

I won't even bother to get into the politics of Cinferella technically being high born, conventionally beautiful and blond and young aka naive...",1511568000,,1242,4.631818181818182

6704303,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I'm one of those cynic people who think fairy tale films are boring and only for kids. I was not interested in watching this when it came out, and thought ""Into the Woods"" would be more suitable for my taste. I was soooo wrong! While Into the Woods couldn't have disappointed me more, I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this Cinderella! So much so I watched it TWICE within the 3 day rental period! And trust me when I say I would watch it again had my rental not expired! :(
What I expected to be a boring retelling/remake of the Disney version, was in fact a touching story about inner beauty, strength and resilience, or to quote them film ""kindness and courage"". I am really pleased that they added depth to the character of the prince and to why Cinderella and him are attracted to each other. The chemistry between the main characters is palpable. Cate Blanchett is fantastic, as always. She can do no wrong! The costumes and sets are magnificent!
Kenneth Branagh never disappoints. He really is a master at storytelling. It makes me want to see all his films again, starting with Hamlet.
This film delivers a very positive message to children, boys and girls alike, while being entertaining for adults as well, so I'm giving this 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! :)

The dress, the acting, the characters the scenery....everything breathtaking and beyond  imaginable.  I love it and as a not so young woman I find it truly encouraging.  I will be buying the DVD as well but I now have a digital copy to watch whenever I want.  Lovely....Thank you so much.

6704308,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I believe this Disney live action is so terribly underrated. The first time I saw it, I absolutely fell in love with the design and costume. A few people wrote that they found it boring and predictable, but I feel like part of the experience of watching this movie is not about the story line/action but about the visual and emotional ties. I was so happy when it stayed close to the original, unlike Tim Burton's Alice and Wonderland that ended up being a mashup of many different Lewis Carroll books and poems rather than sticking to the original.  Overall, the movie made me want everything in it (aside from wicked step family members) especially the ball scenes which I have watched over and over just because of the AMAZING visuals and beauty that is truly awe-inspiring.",1506470400,,777,4.671532846715328

6704310,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I love this live version of Disney's Cinderella, and I say this because it has tones much closer to that of the Grimm Tales. You see, Cinderella wasn't a happy, happy, joy, joy story as told by its originators, the Brothers Grimm. The stepmother was vicious beyond reproach, the sisters were so full of themselves and selfish, all of them so incorrigible and psychotically narcissistic that it's a wonder poor Cinderella didn't end up making an end of them in their sleep. These stepsisters and stepmother are so much more authentic, and the entire movie makes you reel with anger at how they treat Cinderella. Oh the humanity!

Some folks who were expecting the live duplicate of the cartoon may dislike the authenticity of the villains of this story, but if they would just bother to read the Brothers Grimm tales version...they would find that Disney really prettied up those maliciously grim tales. We should all just count our lucky stars that the stepmother didn't cut the toes off her daughters just to get their feet to fit in the slipper (Grimm Tales my friends).",1506384000,7,1072,4.794594594594595

6704312,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Kit & Ella were nice-looking, but not overly so, which was great; complete perfection wouldn't have worked because both Ella and Kit wanted to be accepted for who they were-nice people who didn't have all the answers to life.
I loved the scene where Ella accidentally bumped into the king. It was wonderful & sweet.
The romance between the prince and Ella was understated yet beautifully done. When they first met in the forest, neither one could take their eyes off the other and they learned a lot about each other in their brief conversation. And at the ball, the scene where the prince asks her dance, he puts his hand to her waist AFTER she accepts, which let everyone know she's the girl for him. Very romantic.
Cate Blanchett was fabulously evil; so were the stepsisters, who came close to just being caricatures.
I would like to have seen more of Ella's wedding dress, the scene was too brief! Her ball gown and wedding gown were gorgeous.
Some reviewers felt this remake had 'nothing new' in it. I don't think it should have had anything new. It's best to tell the original story!

The narrator talks through the whole movie, it was driving me crazy. I wanted to yell at the movie, SHUT UP! Let Cinderella talk for once!

6704335,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This movie is a fantastic adaption of Cinderella. The pace of this movie was excellent. The storyline did not drag but moved rather quickly. I enjoyed this version better than 1998 Rodger's and Hammerstein's version. I enjoyed all of the actors and actresses. Cinderella and had prince had great chemistry together. Also, the actress who played the stepmother brought depth and dimensions to her character. The actress who played Cinderella portrayed her character with grace and eloquence. She was Cinderella.  You could feel the inner beauty and love of Cinderella that made her special.  I recommend this movie to audiences of all ages. The entire family will enjoy the movie.  :-)",1502668800,,684,5.1441441441441444
6704336,1,B00O2IZPD8,Disney needs to follow the original step by step rather then bring a classic to life from an animation and do something completely different.  They should have chosen actress's that don't look the best yet have exellent acting skills for the step sisters and Goldie Hawn as the step mother so you have the right energy through the film against Cinderella rather then destroy what could've been the greatest instant classic ever made.  They could still have the actor who was the prince and actress who potrayed Ciderella.  But no this is more of a LIONS GATE or some other film makers look at an attempt to Cinderella yet it is not it is a Disney and a poor excuse at that.  Malefcent was great since it showed the other side to Sleeping Beauty.  Like everyone said costumes were great story poor and choice of secondary actors and actresses poor.  Plus too much off the original story line like they did with 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians that were remakes brought from animation to life.  They were both disappointing films by Disney but 101 was decent but not great.  Disney made their mark in the realm of fairy tales and need to stick with what was already made and just add 2-3 more scenes to surprise the audience yet bring joy.  Also make the animals talk if the original animated version had the animals talking or singing so that the movie takes your breath away and sweeps you right off your own two feet.,1502582400,,1420,4.559055118110236

(I haven't grown up with Disney movies and since the new live action Beauty and the Beast was a musical, I kind of expected Cinderella to be one too.) Also, the story is straight-up Cinderella, and the characters have been played this way a million times. I expected something fresher. The movie Ever After is far better - it takes the Cinderella concept into a new story, with more dynamic but familiar characters.

The only difference that I can recall (a positive one at that)l is that the message you learn is ""always have courage and be kind"".

The relationship between the prince and Cinderella is more developed, and not based on her looks. There doesn't seem to be the typical Disney Agenda here, just a sweet story with positive messages.

There is a reason he likes Cinderella, and the stepmother, played by Cate Blanchett, seems even more dangerous and cruel. We still have our little mice, but they're not wearing shirts or talking (we also get a short glimpse of bluebirds). There is only one song, and it is not the same as any from the cartoon movie, although you can catch the fairy godmother quickly saying, ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo!""

The newest Cinderella movie, starring Lily James as Cinderella, and Richard Madden as Prince Charming, inspires people of all ages to have courage and be kind. Throughout the movie, the audience is shown how Cinderella approaches different challenges in her life. From losing her mother and father, to falling in love with a handsome prince, she handles the experiences with grace and poise.. Director Kenneth Branagh takes us through a classical fairytale adventure that encourages self motivation and confidence.

At the beginning of the film, Cinderella is given a task by her dying mother (Hayley Atwell). Her mother tells her to always have courage and be kind. After her mothers death, life continues on, but eventually takes an unfortunate turn when her father remarries a widowed woman with two daughters. When they first arrive at Cinderellas house on the countryside, the young girl encourages herself to follow through with her mothers wish for her to have courage and be kind. Soon after, her father departs on a long business trip and never returns home. Cinderella makes the choice to remain at her home and cherish it as her mother and father did, even though her stepmother and sisters treat her unfairly. She is treated like a slave; always cleaning, cooking, and dressing her untalented family. When shes had enough, she saddles her horse and rides. While riding, a young gentleman crosses her path. They talk and become friends, but they both keep their identity secret. Cinderella is excited to have a friend outside of her home, but what she doesnt know is that her new friend is the Prince.

Some people may say that the movie is one that has been done before. Because theyve already seen the original, they don't need to waste their time watching another movie with the same story. However, they are wrong. This new Cinderella movie is one the audience can connect to. With the actors in the movie, they can realize that a dream like the one Cinderella has is one that can actually happen in their own life.

In closing, Cinderella is not just a movie for little girls. It is a movie that will inspire anyone who watches it. It will move you to step outside of your comfort zone and be whoever you desire to be.",1487203200,,2246,4.810880829015544

6704473,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Surprisingly, I award this film 5 stars.

I have to admit that when I heard that Disney was going a live action version of this classic tale I was singularly unimpressed with the idea.  But, I decided to give it a look nevertheless.  Last night was the night.

My wife and I had never seen it, and we watched it with our HS-aged daughter who had seen it before.  She told us not to expect too much different compared to the animated version...so we settled in to watch.

I was delightfully surprised as the movie unfolded.  The backstory of Ella and her parents was a nice surprise.  The motivation of her stepmother was well done and she came across as more than just a Disney-ified villain.  I was also extremely pleased to see that the prince was much more than just the entirely boring caricature in the animated version.

The casting was fantastic (Blanchett, Carter, James, Skarsgard, Anozie, Grainger), and the storytelling was top-notch.  I'll be happy to see it again sometime, and I'm happy this is part of our DVD library, even though we no longer have any small children at home.",1486598400,,1091,4.601036269430052

6704560,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I am a bit of a Cinderella nut. I have read dozens and dozens of versions, and looked for every film even vaguely resembling a Cinderella story. This is, by far, the very best. The characters don't just fall in love at a glance as if appearances are all that matters, but after an energetic chase and chat. Cinderella isn't a wimp as she is in many versions, just trapped; and she is kindhearted. She has real reactions to things, not just ""la la la, I'll cry to my animal friends"".  The costumes and sets are really something else; the colours are uplifting and are a good part of what carries the story. The stepmother's outfits are out of this world fantastic!!! Fairy Godmother is a hoot.

Be sure and watch through the end of the credits for a little extra fun.

I do feel younger kids might be disturbed by some of the changes (i.g. animals to coachmen and back), and I thought the pumpkin-changing scene was a concern if little kids didn't understand it was going to be ok when the transformation was over. Finally,

SPOILER ALERT....

When Cinderella was trapped in the coach *as* it turned back into a pumpkin, it was distressing for even me because she was acting like ""Oh no! Help, I'm going to suffocate in here""  (cant' recall what exactly she said, but you get the idea)",1484006400,,1284,4.465811965811966

This is the first order I purchased under used, but specifically looked for the ""like new"" indicator because that is supposed to guarantee the digital redemption code is to be included and unused.  However, there was no code at all in my package, and although the discs due look brand new, I would not have bought if I could not have the digital copy too.  The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 1, is because Amazon has resolved this issue to my complete satisfaction!  However, I will not buy from ""Warehouse Deals"" again.. although I already have another movie on it's way and hope this was isolated incident.",1482019200,,728,4.41044776119403

6704682,3,B00O2IZPD8,"Very uneven.  Several sections of the film were extremely well done, including
some that were both witty and sensitive, but other
scenes, like when the heroine swirls down the stairs at the ball, seemingly trying to look like
a 1950's Disney cartoon, that I thought really boring.  So, half quite good, but half saccharine.
Cate Blanchett is wonderful as the wicked stepmother.",1479168000,,377,5.064516129032258

There was only one thing that got on my nerves and that was the song 'Lavender Blue'. After three times hearing 'dilly dilly' I was so sick of that song I hope to never hear it again. Aside from that the Prince was charming, Cinderella was beautiful, and the stepsisters looked like something from a Tim Burton film.  This is a movie to watch with your children. Just have ear plugs for that dreadful song.",1478390400,,554,4.431372549019608

As noted, there was no way to make it without a nod to the original Disney version but they really upped the beauty, the cruelty, the romance, and the magic. The costuming almost steals the show and you can read about the details elsewhere but it truly brings the tale to life. I loved every moment of this and I am well outside the demographic targeted so young and old will be thrilled. An interesting note: Cate Blanchett said the hardest time to remain in character was during the castle dance as everyone felt the vibe of magic and romance. You will, too!

Warning:  If your child is very sensitive, there is a delicate portrayal of Cinderella's Mum's sorrowful death and this may be a very sad moment.  My 4-year-old was in tears and needed a hug and words of comfort for about ten minutes afterward.",1474070400,2,454,4.782051282051282
6704838,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Cinderella has always been my favorite fairy tale.  I saw this film in the movie theater.

I have to admit I enjoyed it more watching on the DVD.

Lily James is absolutely lovely as our heroine.  I can see why so many people questioned the size of Lily James's waist in the ball gown.  Lily has beautiful chemistry with Richard Madden as our prince.  He is handsome, charming, etc . . .  and they meet beforehand in the woods foreshadowing the reveal of the ball.

Derek Jacobi is loving as the king and Helena Bonham Carter is the most fun as the ditzy fairy godmother.

The stepsisters are malicious but in a half baked way and didn't make much of an impression.

The most intense and focused character is Cate Blanchett as the stepmother.  In the commercials for the film, I thought she was an unusual choice.  I guess I have not seen enough movies with her as the evil character.

Costumed like Joan Crawford in slimy lizard green with painted red fingernails enhanced her outstanding performance.  She is malicious, selfish and attempts blackmail with a crooked royal advisor in the subplot to marry her daughters to nobles as well as becoming a royal herself.

The stepmother receives her comeuppance along with her royal partner.

The final shot of her is priceless.  She looks stuck in time like a mannequin on the stairway.  After Cinderella leaves through the front door, the stepmother sits on the step somewhere in the middle of the stairway.  The camera frame of this moment foreshadows most likely what will happen to her.  She looks through the rails like a criminal worthy of a future imprisonment.  For all her selfish and malicious behavior, the stepmother has more than earned her unknown punishment as she is banished most likely penniless forever from the kingdom.
Buy it and enjoy.",1474070400,5,1803,4.733118971061093
6704839,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Very beautiful cinematically and held up to original story. I really loved how this movie added in the extra story line that displayed the relationship with the main character and her mother.

6704900,5,B00O2IZPD8,"So here it is. I am a 57 year old man who has raised 2 children who have left the nest and are on their own. I of course grew up with Disney movies and drive ins. When my kids were young I took them to see beauty and the beast. Well I hadn't really seen a Disney movie since I was a child and thought I had outgrown them and figured I'd have to suffer through it, for the kids sake. I believe I enjoyed it more than my kids.
So fast forward. Home alone, have watched the 4 good movies on Prime and thought ok, Disney, Kenneth Branagh, why not.
I was amazed. This was a great movie, as close to the animation of Beauty and the Beast as you can get with real actors. The sets, the music, the filming was all fantastic. I really liked that it stayed traditional and didn't try to contemporize.
The acting was perfect. Great movie. I am sure I will watch it again..",1472256000,,861,4.011627906976744

6704902,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This has to be the very first live action adaption i've liked from Disney (Have not seen Sleeping Beauty yet) and heard that was always well done. It keeps to the original storyline well, without random radical new elements. Getting a visual makeover and some new elements, like:

# The relationship of Cinderella's family.
# Her father's demise.
# Mothers relationships with her daughter.
# Homelife
# Stepmothers reasons
# Background plotting against Cinderella

Helping you understand why things are the way they are. The stepmother's motive was a good surprise and not expected. They don't go into heavy detail, but just enough to get an idea. I also loved how they added simple things from the original 1950 cartoon: Facial expressions from the sisters, dialog, scenarios and set pieces. (Crying by a stone bench etc). It's not a carbon copy, but those who saw the original will notice them. Helena Bonham Carter  aka  Bellatrix Lestrange from Harry Potter Series was INCREDIBLE! This is a film even your kids will enjoy. Not just adults.",1472169600,4,1043,4.977011494252873

The cinematography, costumes, and setting are beautiful, and the story is classic. What really impressed me about this movie is the message it sends: have courage, and be kind. What a lovely message for children in this fearful world where there doesn't seem to be enough kindness.

In this film, Cinderella's character is rounded out much more than in the cartoon movie. She has gumption and determination along with beauty and sensitivity. This was a welcome change. A not so welcome change is the lack of traditional Disney songs. I really thought the film would include tunes like ""Bippity, Boppity Boo,"" but it doesn't. Not even one! I wish they could remaster the movie with the music from the cartoon--that would've resulted in a perfect film!

It's still worth your time and money.",1471564800,2,894,4.798701298701299

6704926,5,B00O2IZPD8,"A perfect film. That is what I said aloud as soon as the movie ended.
I knew nothing of the film going in.
I did not know who were the cast or who directed it.
I just wanted to take it on its own merits with no foreknowledge.
Truly a triumph of film making, acting and casting.
And when the credits rolled and it said Directed by Kenneth Branagh, then I said aloud:""Of course it was directed by Kenneth Branagh.""
Kenneth has recently proven he knows how to tell a story of fantasy with the perfect respect of the subject and the drama required to make an emotional connection with the audience.
He did that perfectly in this film and in Thor.
As I watched the evil stepmother and her two useless and evil daughters something nagged at me, a sense of familiarity that was just on the tip of consciousness.
Then suddenly it dawned on me, the evil stepmother and her two stupid, useless daughters are the Kardashians!
It was so clear and so perfect. The Kardashians are the modern counterparts of the evil stepmother and her two stupid, useless daughters.
And Cinderella is the purity of female kindness and beauty that we have lost in this world that perhaps one day will be restored and enrich us all.",1471132800,,1200,4.459090909090909

Other than that, it's the exact. same. thing we've seen a million times. 'Into the Woods' also featured Cinderella which was released just ONE year before this, but at least that was an original mash-up of several fairy tales. I was seriously disappointed with this. Stop rebooting one of the most generic fairy tales of all time unless you're actually going to do something original with it, Disney!!",1469836800,,560,4.84375

6704965,5,B00O2IZPD8,"With over three thousand reviews already posted there may be little ""new"" to add, so this is just a few personal comments.
1.  Utterly breathtaking costumes.  Sandy Powell totally deserved her Oscar nomination.  If it was up to me she'd have won.
2.  BRAVO and THANKS to Swarovski for their many contributions to this film.  The famous Ball has never been dressed so well.
3.  The retelling of an old, beloved tale is a challenge.  What to change?  Where to dig deeper?  Kenneth Brannagh's direction found new life in this familiar story.  Well done, sir.
4.  Lily James sparkled in her ultimate ball gown, but she had already cast a bewitching glow from the first--the soul of purity.
5.  There are so many involved in a large movie that the credits today roll swiftly for five minutes or more.  To bring so much talent to bear on a single project is an awesome endeavor.  Think of it--even the caterers and drivers need to be at the top of their game when so many parts interact.  And when they all gel, as in this version of Cinderella, it's because the production and artistic leadership were stellar.

Every now and then I love a Disney movie that yanks all my heart strings.  Well, Disney, you've done it again.",1469836800,6,1217,4.560185185185185
6704966,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I really enjoyed this movie, a lot more than all of the other Cinderella stories out there.
I liked the fact that cinderellas name was Ella. It was a nice touch to involve the Cinderella name from a point of ridicule from her step sisters. It was also nice to show the gradual increase of household duties for Cinderella, as opposed to straight banishment and servant.
The development of the prince's character was better than any other Cinderella movie as well. The viewer connecting to the prince increases the star rating.
Also, and this is minor but I really liked it, the animals converted by the fairy godmother retained their ""animal look"". This was a nice touch.",1469750400,,670,4.735042735042735

6704970,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This is exactly what you'd expect from Kenneth Branagh:  Beautifully done.  While the acting talent and costuming are obviously wonderful, its the nuances that get your attention.  The looks, the body language, the way a character's breathing seems to change as they become aware of the changes in their lives, all the subtleties that a great director draws from the actors are there in this masterpiece.  The extra features that detail the research into the story, the history of it, all the fun and detail in the ""Ball"" feature, the training of the animals, add to the experience of the movie.  Grab a bowl of popcorn and cozy down for a fun, magical evening of features and movie together.  You'll be transported to another time and place, refreshingly so.",1469664000,2,759,4.844961240310077

6704977,3,B00O2IZPD8,Cute.  I wish they would have expanded it a bit and delved even deeper into the story of Cinderella.  I enjoyed the move Ever After more than this one because I felt that it connected on a deeper level.,1469491200,,202,4.153846153846154
6704978,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Overall this is a lovely film. However, we wish the main character, Cinderalla, had been portrayed more like a ""real girl"": that the fairy godmother had dressed her in the dress she had chosen--her mother's dress--only slightly embellished (and of course cleaned up and repaired!) And we wish that her waist had not been cinched so unrealistically tightly, which gives little girls and young girls the message that you're only truly beautiful if your body shape is actually unrealistic. In this way Disney missed a wonderful opportunity. Lily James already has a very nice figure that doesn't need to be ""enhanced"". Nor did her d&eacute;collet&eacute; need to be so revealing, in the dress she wore to the Prince's Ball (another poor message to young girls).",1469491200,,758,5.072

6705051,5,B00O2IZPD8,"We really enjoyed this movie as a family.  We've all heard the grim fairy tale and seen the many versions of this story, but I think this version was done really well and is worth seeing.  The pleasant surprise was Ella's resolve to always be kind and have courage (the common phrase throughout the movie).  Despite the horrible and sad conditions, she remains a pleasant human being who is not bitter or vengeful.  The rest of the story is somewhat familiar.  The step-mother is played well.  You really dislike her throughout the film.  The aloof and mean step-sisters are done well too without it being too silly.  I think this film does a really good job with getting you to be angry at the step-mother and step-sisters but not allowing Cinderella to put aside her kindness for any sort of vengeful plan and allowing her more positive qualities to shine through.",1468454400,,866,4.688741721854305

6705103,5,B00O2IZPD8,"As a guy sitting down to watch what I would call a ""chick flick"" or a ""girly film"" with my wife, I was expecting to just listen while I did some computer work. I was drawn into this film from the beginning, couldn't pay attention to my computer work, shut it off and watched the film. Both my wife and I were so impressed with the film and hope they make more Disney Princess films like this one. To me this was extremely well done.",1466640000,,432,4.094117647058823

6705111,3,B00O2IZPD8,"Meh. It is a pretty looking movie, but very forgettable.  Besides being visually impressive, it is a very straight forward retelling of Cinderella.  There is so little reinterpretation of the story, that it feels like everyone in the movie is just going through the motions.  To me, it felt like all the actors were phoning it in.  I found this dull and my daughter thought it was merely ok.  My son was so bored, he had to walk away.

I was also really disappointed by the dress.  Considering it is Disney's most iconic princess, I was really waiting to see them go all out on the Cinderella's ballgown.  If figured this high budget revamp would produce a blue dress that would blow me away.  I realize it was a minor quibble, but I was really disappointed to see a dress that looked like it was home made. C'mon Disney, with the multi-million dollar budgets, can't you do better?

But it was entertaining enough for a slow Sunday afternoon.  So it was worth watching once, but it will not be part of this family's Disney collection.",1466553600,,1034,4.535135135135135

6705129,5,B00O2IZPD8,"We are huge Disney fans in my family.  When they announced they would be remaking some of their classic movies with ""real people"", we were really excited.  My 5 year old daughter and I went to see this when it was in the theater.  She and I both thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that she received this DVD/ Blu-Ray/ Digital Copy movie for Christmas.

The movie itself is pretty closely aligned with the original cartoon.  There is a bit of additional information, as well as having more emphasis on Ella's parents' death (a little scary and sad for the 5 year old, but she was fine after we talked about it.  It's very well done).  There is also more focus on the prince and the king, as well as a conspiracy between the step mother and some members of the King's staff.

The music in here is wonderful.  Lavender's Blue (Dilly Dilly) is a song we were unfamiliar with before the movie.  We both fell in love with it!  It has become a nighttime song for both of my kids every night before they go to sleep.  It's such a sweet, cute, perfect night time song.  Even if you don't see the movie, I recommend checking out the song on youtube!

This definitely won't replace any of the classic Disney cartoons, but it's a great addition to a collection.  Both adults and kids enjoy it in my experience.  I can't wait to see more of the live action movies that are schedule to come out!",1466208000,2,1380,4.33203125

6705141,1,B00O2IZPD8,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

Having both Ella and Kit lose their fathers seemed to further destin them to be together.  There were a couple yes/no, yes/no, yes/consent banters with the prince always being right, and I found them to be quite amusing.

6705189,5,B00O2IZPD8,"The best Cinderella live action I've seen since Ever After. Even the Brandy version which was a musical  and I should've despised. This one took me back to the Disney Cinderella, where as a kid you were amazed at the wonderful girl Cinderella was despite having suffered the tragedy of losing her mother at a young age and eventually losing her father later on as well. It has all the hope, the love, the courage that the Disney animation gave me as a child and even well into my twentys. It's the belief in yourself to be who you are, the courage to be who you are and the kindness that everyone has the capacity for if you choose to use it.
The cast is All- Star and I couldn't have picked a better Fairy Godmother, Helena Carter and her many faces of talent. Drew Barrymore and now Lily Jame's are the only Cinderella's who have done the role justice so far.
 Fairy tales exist if you take that chance.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Sometimes you find that ""person"" and you marry them.
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending but it's a journey to see if it will won't it?
This is what that movie will teach kids I hope, and not what that man said about the story teaching kids life is easy and there's always a happy ending.
It's a beautiful film, rich colors, quirky CGI, and superb performances all around.",1464998400,,1325,4.317269076305221

6705218,4,B00O2IZPD8,I liked this version of Cinderella. It keeps with the Disney motifs. I liked the fact that I had no expectations of the actor and actresses. It did have a few big names but they did not dominate the screen or over showdown the other actors.,1464566400,,240,4.239130434782608

6705223,5,B00O2IZPD8,"My daughters and I saw this movie in the theater and then purchased the blu ray. I can't commend Disney and Director Kenneth Branagh enough for their ""live action"" version of this classic tale. It tells the story of Cinderella without ever cheapening it by adding modern themes to it. Lily James is perfect as Cinderella. As she goes through her trials and tribulations, you genuinely feel for this poor girl. James portrayal of Cinderella is sweet without ever being too over the top. The other actors in the movie are also well cast with the standouts being Madden (Robb Stark from Game of Thrones) as the Prince, Blanchett as the Stepmother and Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother. The visuals in the movie are also beautiful. Branagh has a knack for creating majestic lands. He did a tremendous job portraying Asgard in Thor and does the same here. I highly recommend this wonderful movie to every family. It is clean entertainment that delivers a fun, beautiful story that will tug at the heartstrings. My wife and daughters absolutely loved it as well. The movie relays the quote, ""Have courage and be kind.""  Words to live by.",1464480000,2,1134,4.756345177664975

What they did add was tasteful, well done, and added to the story without changing the plot. However, I've seen the story of Cinderella done so many times, it really starts to lose its luster after a while. I do wish that they had added the songs that were in the 1950 movie to the film. They were on the soundtrack, and I really enjoyed them, so it would have been possible.",1462838400,,548,4.330097087378641

This was excellent! Casting was perfect & the chemistry between all sparked & gave the story complete realism. The breadth & depth of character for all, the King, Prince & the parents of Ella really filled in & fleshed out the story. It truly deserved standing ovations! Well done!

Seems they tried to give the story a ""moral message"" but also went out of the way to dress Cinderella and her sisters rather immodestly... Flaunting cleavage throughout the whole movie and emphasizing it with heavy breathing & body language... Can't say that is a ""moral message"" I want for my daughters. Would have been nice if the virtue of modesty had been included. Also weren't many ""cheerful parts of the movie and it had a rather dull & depressing feel throughout most of it. Had hoped for better all around. I'll stick with the original Cinderella.",1461715200,,728,4.6953125

I love Lily James and Richard Madden as Cinderella and the Prince.  The sets and costumes in the film are awesome and the extras that are on the DVD show you how all of it was created from the ground up.  Kate Blanchett makes a very  mean but also sad Stepmother and the two step-sisters are hilarious, constantly fighting and doing their best to make Cinderella's life tough.  Another Downton Abbey alum, Sophie McShera, aka Daisy, is one of the step-sisters and does a great job.  And Helena Bonham Carter is a surprisingly befuddled fairy godmother.  It's a wonderful film from start to its happily ever after finish!",1461024000,,796,4.635714285714286

I tried to go on Amazon.com return, it tell me the last day to return it was April 7, 3 days ago. I tried to find a ph # to call Amazon, clicked on countless pages of all times of info but got ZERO help. Just went in circles for almost an hour. Can Amazon contact me?

There is one BIG change to the basic story. However, I was surprised otherwise how close they kept to the original fairy tale. Speaking of fairies, the Fairy Godmother steals the movie in her all too brief role ... providing the only truly fresh performance in the film. There are no surprises in the rest of the roles.",1460246400,,489,4.6976744186046515

6705597,5,B00O2IZPD8,Without doubt the finest Cinderella ever produced. The special effects and acting are spectacular. It's obvious that everybody enjoyed making this movie. Thankfully it's a story and not a musical which enhances its moral. The ballroom scene is fantastic and the transformation of Cinderella's coach back into a pumpkin is a marvelous exhibition of digital art. Probably one of the best movies Disney ever made. It's one of those few movies that can be enjoyed over and over again.,1457049600,,480,5.0886075949367084

I'm being stubborn, I know, but I absolutely refuse to replace all my DVDs with Blu-rays. I did that replacement once (VHS to DVD) and enough is enough. Anyway, this ""reality"" version starts earlier than the rest of them, introducing us to her kind and gentle mother whom Ella takes after. If you love the story of Cinderella this version is not to be missed. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as the stepmother - hard and cold but not really horribly cruel.

It is entertaining and not necessarily predictable although most all of us know how it will end but there are other twists within. The Prince is a bit over the top for my liking but Cinderella is a fiesty one and I like that. She doesn't just let things go by but she has some fighter in her which is a refreshing change from the animated one.  The fairy godmother is a bit weird but what do you get when you have Helena playing anything, it just comes out a little weird.

6705653,1,B00O2IZPD8,"Cate Blanchett is the mean stepmother in this new ""Cinderella."" In fact, she is the best thing. I thought just about everything Disney touched turned to gold, but this was a major disappointment in all departments. The leads for Cinderella and particularly Prince Charming were perfectly dreadful with no screen presence or chemistry together and their characters were extremely dull. You never are brought to care about them, despite the fact Cinderella's father and mother are gone soon after the movie begins. I was very disappointed in this and I was surprised to see it so popular on IMDB. Or am I? I did see that some people have trashed it. Some say that even their children didn't like it -  very discerning and wise people they will be. If you want to see Cinderella, there are several versions to pick from, the original animated one, the Julie Andrews film, the Lesley Ann Warren film, and ""The Slipper and the Rose."" There are probably more, but none can top those four - EVER. Don't watch this one! You've been warned.",1455753600,6,1031,4.727777777777778

6705657,3,B00O2IZPD8,"Cate Blanchett has the best character development in this very thinly written tale. Her manipulative evil unfolds in smoothly executed slights presented as niceties. Her motivation is clearly jealousy and greed cloaked in sugar.
I enjoyed Derek Jacobi as the king and Helena Bonham-Carter as the fairy godmother, both of which didn't have enough screen time.
But...Costumes were inconsistent to the point of silliness...from a very paired down 1830's to a weird 19th century version of the 1940's to the 1950's. The film didn't have a coherent look. The main characters were blandly forgettable.
It was the basic fairy tale and not much else.",1455580800,,642,5.1826923076923075
6705658,5,B00O2IZPD8,"there's nothing like a an old Disney classic revamped to appeal to adults.. I loved everything about this new version except that the fairy godmother didn't have a big enough part. I have to hand it to the Disney company, they are really hitting home runs with these remakes. I know I'm supposed to be commenting on Cinderella but I think the best way to do that is by saying that this movie is right up there with Disney's new Alice in Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty (Maleficent). I hope they remake all the old Disney Classics.",1455580800,,529,4.520833333333333

6705672,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This is the most wonderful film - everything you want in Cinderella and nothing you don't.  I've read reviews on the internet that diss it because of stupid things such as Lily Evans waistline or Cinderella being to 'shallow' but the first is just ridiculous (okay, she's thin, she's a thin woman playing a teenager, it's not like she's a stick!) and the second is proof the reviewer didn't actually watch the movie at all.  The script has lots of depth in very quiet ways, you just have to listen for the one-off lines that provide backstory and character without hitting you over the head with it.  They solved a lot of problems with the fairy tale in easy ways, leaving you with a tale of a girl who chooses kindness over negativity, and to love even when those around her don't necessarily deserve it.  She has heartache, she has anger, but she chooses to be positive.  I'm not saying it's the deep profound story of the year, but sometimes you want a pure, innocent tale of how choosing the high road and having the strength to endure wins the day.  They prince is fleshed out so you actually feel there's a good reason for her to love him (and he her - it's not just love at first site but an actual connection of minds and souls).  The parents and their effect of their children are fully dimensional, the bad guys have reasons and aren't just scene-chewing cardboard cutouts of badness.  Finally, the music is grand, with its three specific themes that you can trace throughout, the cinematography is break-taking, and the craft of costumes and sets sets the scene beautifully for a 'period' piece that is in an undefined time and place - just as a fairy tale should be.  Every time I watch this I see things I've missed before, and it's simply one of the most beautiful, lyrical and uplifting movies you can possibly watch.  And if you REALLY pay attention, they even explain why the shoes don't vanish at the stroke of midnight!!",1455408000,,1939,4.545977011494253
6705673,1,B00O2IZPD8,"Dear Deity, do not buy this travesty of a movie. It says a lot that the End section mentions Cate Blanchett (evil StepMom) and the Credits music is from the animated classic). No offense to the lead actress, but Cinders looks about 40 and the Fairy Godmother is an afterthought.  Why didn't they just do a live action version of the animated movie? Why did they bother? I got it on NetFlix and feel like I wasted my money. If I could give it negative stars, I would.",1455408000,,466,4.295454545454546

I love the graphic and how they use some unused plot for the original animation where the prince meet Cinderella during the horse riding. The other things that really makes me love this movie even more is the transformation sequence. It was done well and the butterfly theme for the dress is fresh and creative. Mythological references also used in the movie which is great. I like mythology and I love mythological references. Good choice of actors.

This was a surprise as I did not expect much, but it's a sweet story and a refreshed version of what might feel to be a played out tale... the spin on it with the Cinderella's focus on kindness and courage was endearing and she is not just some weakling who is saved by a prince, she is a strong woman who maintains her joy and innocence despite much adversity.

However, if you are not a literature buff, you may miss the layers of symbolism and medieval poetry in this PERFECT ADAPTATION OF THE CLASSIC FAIRY TALE.  Fairy Tales were the old ways of teaching Morals to children.  This is NOT A TYPICAL DISNEY MOVIE. I for one, am not a fan of Disney's habit of re-writing classic fairy tales and imposing modern issues.  Kenneth Branaugh is a Genius Director. The casting is Flawless. The story line is Captivating. I have watched it both in the theater with my over 21 year old daughter (who was moved) and now on DVD several times.  Do yourself a favor and look up Steven Greydanus movie review  - just google him and Cinderella.  He will help you discover what you might miss.",1454457600,,785,4.454545454545454

The timeless story of Cinderella was intended to show a woman of humility and kindness who was willing to be content to serve the world by bringing it joy, a woman so humble in her kindness to the world that she took the brunt of selfish, self-centered women with brave dignity.  Every time this story gets remade into a Cinderella who is brass, tough, has a big mouth and isn't afraid to make loud decisions, it completely misses the point of the story.  Finally, the lesson of the original Cinderella is remembered.",1454371200,,589,4.699029126213592

The music also is enchanting without overpowering - a seamless but luscious addition to an already entrancing vision.

6705734,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I received this as a Christmas gift and watched it for the first time recently. I LOVED it! A fan of all of the original Disney classics, I'm always interested in the modern-day adaptations to see what kinds of fun twists the directors come up with. Going into these movies, I know that they don't necessarily follow the original story exactly but I think that's what makes them fun, fresh stories to watch. Some of the remakes of the original  Cinderella are ""Ever After"" and ""A Cinderella Story,"" both of which I've seen and enjoyed. Personally, I liked this 2015 version better because it was a magnificent blend of the original classic, digital enhancements, and some fairy magic.

By now, I'm sure most people know the story of Cinderella and how she comes to live with her evil stepmother and stepsisters. In this version, her name is Ella and she winds up with only her stepmother and stepsisters but there are some added twists that help to build up the story. I won't go into detail so I don't ruin the movie for any interested customers but I really enjoyed the way Kenneth Branagh directed this movie and gave it a fresh, modern-day twist that is both humorous and magical. The cast did a fantastic job and one of my favorite parts is the dress transformation scene, which made me sigh with happiness!

Before we watched this, I checked to see the rating of this movie and was delighted to see that it was PG-rated and that many parents enjoyed watching it with their children. I'm very cautious about what I allow my three-year-olds to watch and they enjoyed it as well. There are no scary scenes at all and, even though they typically prefer animated movies, this movie has enough fairy magic to keep them entertained for the entire hour and 45 minutes. If you enjoy some of the modern-day adaptations of the classics such as ""Maleficent,"" I would highly recommend watching this one. It's a beautiful, magical story that is perfect for the whole family to enjoy!",1454198400,,1975,4.653295128939828

She danced and was transfixed throughout the entire movie. She even begged and begged for me to replay it immediately after it was done. (I might of considered if we did not have to leave the house.)

The writing, acting, directing and cinematography were all very well done.

They done it so beautifully that you think they were part of original story.  Not only they stick to the original story, they also made each of fairy tale characters has virtues to live by, for example, evil stepmother is not evil because she is stepmother but because the love she didn't have chance to have.  The costumes and the castle of the grand ball were very impressive. I felt all the fairy tale re-made should be like this one.

So much exaggerated acting and they made Helena Bonham look like a strung out grandma. She's lost her touch too. Writing was as though they hardly made an effort to develop a good story, unlike with Maleficent which had a great story. The main actress is constantly moaning and biting her lip with exaggerated breathing. Even Cate Blanchett's acting was off, sad to say because she is one of my favorite actresses. I honestly can't think of anything that I really liked about the movie except the graphics for the mice. Seems like it was basically thrown together as an easy payout honestly.

All the actors and crew seem to have a had a great time making this film and it shows.

6705830,1,B00O2IZPD8,"I bought a version of this (Lily James) from Amazon--no longer carried--with cover of Cinderella and Prince facing each other.  I bought it because I had rread (misread?) that IT was the version which did not include the lengthy deaths of her parents.  I don't know whether this version covers that material, but I'd be wary.  Disney has always loved to ""knock off"" parents (Bambi's mother's death and the fire even back then were terrifying for lots of children.)  I buy for a intellectually disabled adult son.  He loves the ORIGINAL animated Cinderella (FUNNY) and the movie made by Brandi and Whitney Houston (wow, what singing!.)  This has grand costumes and Lily James is gorgeous, but it is full of strange, new elements.  I watched it before giving to my son and will have to sell it to kids' consignment.  This is more HORROR STORY than FAIRY TALE!  It has a happy theme and ending, but there are many elements I'd not seen before, such as her fairy godmother originally appearing to her as a dreadful looking.  hag!",1452816000,6,1025,4.707865168539326

I've always been a fan of the original animated Cinderella, and quite frankly I didn't have high expectations for this remake.

6705832,5,B00O2IZPD8,"What a wonderful tale! It was true to the Disney version told in the animated classic, but with some added extras that fill in some of the plot holes and with a deeper understanding of the motivation of the characters. It was cinematically beautiful with intense, lush colors and amazing scenery. The special effects were incredible as well. There was also some comedic relief thrown in for. That good measure.

Perhaps most important was the message of the movie, which was repeated often, so there was no way one could miss it. It is important to have courage and be kind. That was what made Cinderella special and worthy of being a true princess. That's a good message for little girls (and big girls) to hear.",1452729600,,713,4.658730158730159

6705835,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I know I'm in the minority for some reason, but I found this exquisite little fairy tale to be a wonderful rendition of the Cinderella story. An under appreciated gem, in my opinion. The costumes alone are worth a look, but it's the performances by Evil Stepmother, Cinderella, her father, the Prince, the Stepsisters, the Fairy Godmother, the King (a wonderful, heartwarming performance by a top shelf British actor,) and even the minor characters are lovely. Cinderella's Mother, for example, was such a lovely character that her death left me gasping. All the actors are the absolute best and Kenneth Branagh did a great job directing. Wish there were more extras with the DVD, but the ""Frozen"" short made me want to see ""Frozen;"" so that's something, too, as i had no interest before that. The story strays from the original in ways that I found to be just fine and it was beautiful, heart warming and charming. The only thing I didn't like was the silly pop song at the end with the credits. They really should have stuck with ""Once Upon a Dream,"" a fine song in it's own right and a lovely version. Other than that, I've watched the film several times now and count it amongst my favorite fairy tale movies now. I really don't understand why this wasn't better received. People are way too cynical these days, if they can't appreciate a lovely film such as this one. Absolutely worth the price of admission and I'm only sorry I missed it in the theatres when it came out.",1452643200,,1477,4.619771863117871

6705843,5,B00O2IZPD8,"For those with doubts as to whether or not to watch CINDERELLA, toss the jaundiced eye aside and prepare for an evening of creative melding of a very old fairy tale as enhance by the lasted in cinematic art. Recast into a screen play by Chris Weitz who has the sensitivity to fill in the missing pieces form the original story (how Ella, a young girl from a happy family loses her beloved mother, then lives with her father who finally decides to marry again  to a beautiful but self-centered mother who has just lost her husband and must struggle to survive with her two obnoxious daughters, taking in Ella and treating her as a maid) makes the story come alive. Match that with the creative direction by Kenneth Branagh and the skills of incorporated animation by Disney, anchored by a stellar cast and the whole thing works beautifully.

Cinderella is brought to life by Lily James, her father by Ben Chaplin, her mother by Hayley Atwell, the handsome and kind Prince by Richard Madden, the king by Derek Jacobi and his court by Stellan Skarsgrd and Nonso Anozie, the stepmother by Cate Blanchett (strangely overlooked by awards nominations) and her daughters by Sophie McShera and Holly Grainger, and the wondrous fairy godmother by the inimitable Helena Bonham Carter  a dream cast who are obviously have a terrific time recreating one of our favorite fairytales.

The transformation of the pumpkin into a coach, the mice into horses, and the splendid dresses for both the fairy godmother and Cinderella allow the magic of animation to be subtly used in a manner that seems completely credible  if you can still believe in magic.

In a time where the screens are crowded with apocalyptic, Marvel comic book reincarnations, and noisy corruption and crime films, CINDERELLA is a little island of happiness. Grady Harp, January 16",1452384000,,1832,4.855769230769231

6705866,3,B00O2IZPD8,"I enjoyed this movie, it was good, but not great. The scenery & everything was beautiful, it was ""magical"", the animals were adorable, & I enjoyed the funny moments, but there was just something missing. There wasn't enough story between Cinderella & the Prince or between her & her step-mother & sisters. I also don't see why the Prince's father had to die, he was very much alive in the Disney cartoon. It was starting to get a little depressing & the story seemed to be a bit rushed. Another thing that bugged me was ""Cinderella's"" big, bushy dark eyebrows... hard to take her seriously. Like I said earlier, I enjoyed it... I bought it & I'll probably watch it again, but it could have been better. My mom watched it with me the first time & she had the same feelings about the movie as I did. I give this version of Cinderella 3 out of 5 stars. That's just my opinion.

My most favorite version of Cinderella (besides the original Disney cartoon version of course) is ""Ever After"" starring Drew Barrymore.... now that movie had heart!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ever-After-A-Cinderella-Story/dp/B00006ZXSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ever After - A Cinderella Story</a>",1451779200,,1221,5.229591836734694

I think Demi's portrayal of Cinderella was off in every way.  She made her seem like this timid little frail thing who wouldn't be able to stand on her own two feet.  Cinderella is supposed to be a dainty princess, but not timid & frail.  And her voice was really getting on my nerves!  There could have been a lot more done with this movie.  The production seemed more like one of Disney's made for TV movies, not a theatrical release.",1451347200,3,575,4.220183486238532

I especially liked that this movie gave some background to her childhood, parents and how she came to be with the step-mothers and sisters.  I liked the bonus features very much.  I'm always curious as to how certain scenes are created and made to look so real.  Her gown and the gold coach are just beautiful.  No expense was spared making the film.  I usually rent these for a one-time watch, but I purchased this one to watch again and again.  The actress who played Cinderella also has a singing voice like an angel.  She doesn't sing in the movie but she did record ""A Dream is a Wish a Heart Makes"".",1450396800,,673,4.479338842975206
6705921,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Disney saw fit to precede Kenneth Branagh's live-action retelling of Cinderella with a short film ""sequel' to their animated hit, Frozen. It's a union that works perfectly in just about every way because Cinderella, like Frozen, isn't really looking to reinvent the wheel. It's there telling a sweet and inspiring princess story full of charming princes, evil stepmothers, and magical powers. For once, Disney has decided to forego reimaginings and unnecessary attempts to soften iconic characters (hello Maleficent) and stuck with elegant, well-told simplicity, and the approach fits like a glass slipper.

Steeped in a dazzling array of confectionary colors and sparkling magical whimsy that compares beautifully to the 1950 animated classic, Cinderella makes a strong case to be first in our thoughts. While screenwriter Chris Weitz largely sticks to the story beats we've all known since childhood, the few changes he does make actually streamline and improve the tale in small but noticeable ...

6705933,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This movie is everything you thought it would be and more!  Such a heartwarming show on a classic Disney film.  I loved the basic message through out the whole show.  Have Courage, and be kind!  Such a good message to live by.

This movie stays pretty true to the classic Disney film you remember from your childhood, with even a lot of the costumes looking very similar.  The Music in this is truly wonderful. I couldn't stop singing the songs all day long.

I cried I laughed and I felt the emotions the actors felt. This is a movie you will want to have for your own personal collection.  Buy this movie today you will not regret it I promise.  An INCREDIBLE, MAGICAL, WONDERFUL show for the ENTIRE family.

Cinderella's (known as Ella in the movie) Mother passes away at the beginning of the movie, Her father eventually remarries but yet again Ella is faced with more heart heartache when he passes away as well.  Cinderella is forced to live with her Cruel Step-Mother and her two daughters. Cinderella remembers the words her mother told her before she passed ""Have courage & Be Kind""  Which she strives to live by even through all her struggles and trying times living with her abusive Step-Mother.  Of course we all know the story Ella meets her prince Charming and they are married and she lives Happily ever after!  Like I said This is a wonderful show that has incredible costume design, good actors that do a great job portraying their characters and amazing computer animation. Ella's dress alone looked incredible.  I couldn't stop watching the movie. it kept my attention and focus the whole time which normally doesn't happen. Not even the Laundry was able to  interrupt me during this one.  This will leave you with such a good feeling and a desire to want to be a better person and live better.  Don't miss this film.  As I say This film is definitely a ""BUY ME FILM""",1450137600,,1886,4.576119402985075

Warning - once you spot this tick you can't not see it.  It is distracting so read on knowing it could ruin your viewing of the movie.
Cinderellas bosom heaves up and down non-stop.
I believe she is trying to act exited and scared but it is constant.  She talks breathlessly with the low cut dresses and you get to see her chest going up and down breathingit is TOO much.  Ruined the movie for us.

6705958,5,B00O2IZPD8,"My six year old daughter Paige is a huge Cinderella fan. I remember she was my favorite too when I was a little girl. I had a Cinderella record that had pictures on it and I would listen to the music for hours, just watching the pictures spin. I can still remember the feeling she gave me when I saw the original movie and I couldn't wait for my daughter to experience the same magic.

Since she's just six and it's not a cartoon, it was a little hard for her to hang in with watching the movie. I think that the location and accents of the cast threw her a bit since it was so unfamiliar. She perked up a bit with the appearance of the step-sisters since their characters were so animated, even though they weren't literally animated! She was able to better follow along from that point on, especially with the appearance of the fairy God mother.

I thought the choice of the Fairy Godmother starting out old and becoming young and beautiful was interesting. Of course that made it appeal more to the younger generation.

Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother was my favorite casting choice. She was dreadfully awful and wonderfully perfect in the role. She's always been a favorite of mine and I knew she could do it justice like no other.

The costumes were beautiful and exquisite in a way only Disney can do. The same can be said for the special effects and the wonderful transformation of the animals and pumpkin into the famous character. It was magical as it could be!

Disney's Cinderella is a must have for Disney lover and Cinderella fans everywhere. It might be hard for the younger to fully appreciate but once they see the magic start to happen they'll be hooked!",1449619200,,1679,4.491803278688525

6706003,2,B00O2IZPD8,"Painful somewhat preachy narration that lowered the caliber of the film.  Acting was okay.  Nice theme of courage and kindness, but done in a heavy-handed way, and I wanted Cinderella to stop interpreting kindness as being a doormat.

It was as if the film-maker couldn't decide to make it a cartoonish live action film or go for broke and make the characters real with genuine depth, just a few brushes with it.. It felt stylized, but not done well enough to be more than annoying.  It had some themes or images reminiscent of some other great Cinderella movies, which could have worked if those had been developed more and didn't feel as if someone just threw them in with a anxious attempt to give the film a little more complexity.  Spoiler alert: I like the fact that the prince fell for her thinking she was a country girl and that he recognized her at the ball (The Glass Slipper does the same, only in that case the prince personally gives her an invitation).

I wanted to like the film and it doesn't take much to get me to like a Cinderella story, but overall this one left me unimpressed and wishing I hadn't spent the money to get it.  Would definitely recommend instead: Ever After, The Glass Slipper, the Disney cartoon Cinderella and The Slipper and the Rose.  And if you get a chance, try the Faerie Tale Theater Cinderella with Jean Stapleton as the fairy Godmother.",1449100800,,1383,4.57085020242915

Your second viewing allows you to actually watch the film. Kenneth Branugh is a treasure as a director.  His deft hand is evident in the care taken with every aspect of the film.  The wedding dress is the single best piece of costuming in the last 50 years and I am a huge fan of the costuming of the Lordof the Rings movies.

There is a fine line between being kind, respectful and being a doormat, but I felt that Ella figured that out. Cate Blanchett is fabulous as the evil step mother! I love her in whatever role she plays!  And, despite other reviews, I think Lily James did a fantastic job in the role of Ella! I imagine Cinderella to be a difficult role to put much spunk and depth into the character since she is the 'barbie doll' of the fairy tale world.... Lily James pulled off Cinderella with a gentle spirit and a bit of attitude. I wish I had seen it on the 'big screen' instead of my t.v.

Kenneth Branagh nailed this one!  From the casting, to the costumes and sets, and the charming little tweaks to the story, it just draws you in.  The ballroom dance scene is, in my opinion, the most beautiful waltz/dance scene I have ever seen on film (I think I've watched that scene at least 30 or more times already).  The extras on the Blu-Ray DVD are really enjoyable, especially the ""Staging the Ball"" sequence.  Last, but not least, Kenneth chose well in casting Lily James in the lead, and Richard Madden as the Prince.  She has that charming sweetness that embodies Cinderella, and together these two have great screen chemistry.  Helena Bonham Carter is an absolute hoot as the Fairy Godmother!

6706077,3,B00O2IZPD8,"After reading the reviews I'm sure someone paid for those long and flowery tributes.
Something about cinderellas acting was off. It might have been that she acted too young idk.
The movie was so long and drug out. It stuck to the original Disney film with 50% longer running time. It lost my and my fathers interest after ten minutes but we were too committed to watching it (not to mention too lazy to change the movie)  I would rather have a shorter animated based version or one with extra characters and side stories like Ever After (which btw is amazing and will NEVER be passed up in Cinderella retellings) this movie attempts to be like ever after by producing another way that Ella and the prince originally meet. But it paints Ella as childish and naive and the prince as lovesick rather than strong and independent characters with the potential for growth and falls.
The preview shows 2/3 funny scenes in the film. Honestly the preview is everything you need to know about the movie to piece it together.
*spoiler alert* I didn't like how the duke and lady Trumain were banished from the kingdom. It goes against all kindness courage and the declaration of forgiveness from Cinderella. It should have followed the original grims tale, where she invites the lady to live in the palace and provides her sisters with marriages to royal guards.
The sound track is way too subtle. I can't remember any tunes or words from the song except the fact that the one which Ella sings consists of one verse over and over and no trace of ""a dream is a wish"" is to be found.
The biggest character development is found in Gus.

And what the hell is with the nick name of Kit? Where did that come from? Really Cinderella ruined the end of the movie when the prince says ""you are my queen"" and she says ""and you're my kit"" *facepalm**gag* we know his father called him that but what does it mean? What's his real name again?

To redeem parts of the movie...
The best actors are obviously Lady Trumain and fairygodmother. The vileness and pain of the villain are so plain, and the playfulness of fairygodmother is refreshing.
The captain of the guard is boss.
Costumes and digital effects are flawless.",1448409600,2,2193,4.589285714285714

What comes through is the basic story without the retojection of politically correct garbage onto a deep psychic myth that is this wonderful story... which in itself is refreshing. But again... what is special about this version is Miss James: for her alone the this movie redition of this old wonderful story is a, happy beginning and... ending.",1448236800,,609,4.912621359223301

But I just didn't see enough of the happiness between her and the prince and their story. Like, if we didn't all know it was supposed to be there then I would not feel like there wasn't much between them. It wouldn't matter but I was watching with my daughter who only knows the Disney cartoon Cinderella story, and she kept asking questions about if she liked the Prince and why everyone hated Cinderella.

6706206,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This is an amazing movie, one of the best ""Fairy Tale"" adaptations that I have seen.  The special effects are grand, the sets and palaces
magnificent and a splendid cast.  It follows Disney's animated version closely but with a few adjustments.  There is a bit of  you-know-what
political correctness in it (but not too much!) but the overall production is superb!  I found the nasty evil Stepmother rather hot, too!  The acting
is very good and I thought the Fairy Godmother well thought out.  But I missed  the ""Bibbidy, Bobbidy, doo song).  The Carriage is wonderfully.
gorgeous; I hope Disney kept it and did not destroy it after the production was finished.  Should be in a museum (Smithsonian?).  All lovers of
Disney classics should add this to their video libraries.  I am old enough to remember when going to the movies was a pleasant experience with
cartoons, G movies and newsreels (Truman visiting the troops in Korea) and this is kind of a throwback to those days.  I am not particularly fond
of the present day Disney Company and its ""liberal"" bent but this a good one along with a few other superb first rate productions.  This movie
is good for the children and for Adults as well.  Nicely Done, Disney!  FIVE STARS!  I got my DVD from Amazon as usual,,Enjoy!!",1447372800,,1276,4.701357466063349
6706207,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Beautiful retelling!! Cinderella has always been my favorite, but as I got older I realized that the story really lacked depth. This movie adds that depth that I seek as an adult. They change some things from the original Disney movie, but they are things that are acceptable since they are important to the depth factor. It makes the story more believable as well. It's a beautiful retelling with beautiful visuals. I can't begin to say how much I love this movie.",1447372800,,465,4.682926829268292

6706242,4,B00O2IZPD8,"After seeing what Disney did with the Sleeping Beauty story in Maleficent, I had expected a brand new story with this one.  Best way to describe this is to combine 2 other movies: Disney's Cinderella (animated version) and Ever After.  This movie does not deviate from the animated version at all.  Mom dies, dad remarries, 2 awful step sisters...etc.  Cinderella does bump into the prince long before the announcement of the ball (a part reminding me of the movie Ever After).  One thing that took me by surprise was when the prince became king BEFORE searching the kingdom with his glass slipper.  So wen the grand duke arrives at the cottage - home of Cinderella and her family - it is a king who is searching for the mysterious woman, not a prince.  Interesting twist in the story.  All in all, a good movie to watch...just don't expect any deviations as there were in Maleficent.",1447200000,,884,4.658064516129032

6706259,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Kenneth Branagh's ""Cinderella"" is the best adaptation of the story I have ever seen -- bar none.  In an era when heroine's wield swords and full body armor while metrosexual men wring their hands in eunuchal angst, a movie that actually celebrates the feminine traits of the heroine is -- dare I say it- refreshingly subversive.  And a prince who hunts, fences, and wears his masculinity on his sleeve is a breath of traditional fresh air!

Unlike Ever After, an inferior production of the Cinderella story by any objective standard, Branagh's Cinderella places the characters squarely in the mores of the time in which they lived.  This Cinderella doesn't throw apples at the prince's head or give him piggy-back rides -- she is a princess, even in rags.

The costumes are sumptuous, the sets magnificent, and the acting first rate.

I will be in love with this Cinderella for the rest of my life.",1447113600,,898,4.798701298701299

6706277,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Lovely... just really lovely. It manages to tell what is often considered an outdated tale with truth and sincerity without being burdened by an overwhelming dose of saccharine silliness. This is perhaps due in large part to Lily James' genuine and truthful portrayal of Cinderella as well as the performances of Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, and Richard Madden. Of particular note is the lovely moment when Richard Madden (Prince Charming) curls up next to his dying father after received permission to find the girl who ""forgets her shoes."" The Disney cartoon is cheekily woven in, which no doubt gives any fan of it a few chuckles and the thrill of recognition. In short, if you like the Disney Cinderella story, then you'll like this. If you don't, well, then you won't.",1447027200,,782,4.931818181818182

6706351,2,B00O2IZPD8,"Honestly, we lived through it, but this movie just felt like another of Disney's forced cash cows. They've got this idea that they have to make all their old movies into live action. Cheap CGI special effects that look like they were done over a decade ago, horrible love story acting (sure, the plot isn't realistic that it happens that fast, but at least show you like each other as much as a pair of bf/gf middle schoolers), and the step mother and sisters don't come across as evil, just annoying at the very most. The worst they ever do is ruin a dress and call her names. She never really looks run down and disheveled like a live action Cinderella could have been.

She conveys such innocence genuinely is wonderful to watch.  Cate Blanchett is a wonderfully wicked evil step mother and you love to hate her in this role.  It's worth the watch just to see her in that gorgeous green dress from the ball.  You and your family won't be disappointed.  It's a movie you can watch with the kids without being bored or listening to ""let it go"" for the 100th time.",1446508800,,527,4.612903225806452

Cate Blanchett, Sophie McShera, and Holliday Grainger's performances are just as the movie says, as wicked within as they are beautiful without.

6706373,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Disneys Cinderella, directed by Kenneth Branagh is fantastic! Now available on DVD/Blu-ray/Digital, this movie is about a girl named Ella (Lily James) who ends up living with her stepmother (Cate Blanchet) and stepsisters (Sophia McShera and Holliday Grainger). Ella is treated like a servant until one night when the prince holds a ball that changes her life.

Ella is a kind and courageous girl who cares about everyone and everything. One of her mothers sayings was, ""have courage and be kind."" This is a good message to use in life. I think Ella as a character is a good role model. She stands up for what she believes in and is always very kind.

This film is very detailed and precious. The costumes in Cinderella are amazing and breath-taking.

All the costumes were very stylish and fit the time period. Every sparkle, seam and ruffle on every costume were perfectly in place. Ella's ball gown is spectacular and has very vibrant colors. In general, all the colors in the sets and costumes light up the film.

All the actors played their parts perfectly. They are so into their characters that they seem real. The actors fit together as a cast like family which helps make the whole film more believable. My favorite character is the Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter). She is so funny and has a bubbly personality. She really looks and acts like a Fairy Godmother. All the special effects seem real. In one scene, a pumpkin turns into a carriage and it looks like magic.

The DVD of this movie includes some cool bonus features. One of the bonus features is Frozen Fever, a Frozen short (based on the feature film Frozen). In this film, it's Anna's birthday and Elsa helps out. Another feature is Ella's furry friends. This feature is about working with all the animals in the movie. Also there's a bonus feature about the ballroom scene which made me realize how much work they put into these scenes.
I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars for all of its incredible sets, details and costumes. I recommend it for ages 3 to 19 because this film would appeal to all ages but, there is a lizard guy who is weird and a little creepy that younger kids might not enjoy so much. Cinderella truly is spectacular and now its available on DVD/Blue-Ray/Digital.

The centering aroubd the being kind and having courage while keeping true to the wondrous loving fairy magic of Disney is thrilling and visually stunning. The movie captures our imagination as a beautiful story of first love in true fairy tale form. The character development is well developed and never strays off course. Cinderella is graceful, poised, confident and vulnerable while constantly maintaining the highest form of dignity in the face of adversity. The Prince is charming, and plays a much needed uodate as traditionally the character is almost wall paper to the storyline. And here plays the secondary predominant role. The score composed by Patrick Doyle always weaving dreamy Dilly Dilly theme throughout while bringing traditional classic symphonic ballroom pieces assists in the emotional enrapture. This does not disappoint. Truely magical.",1446422400,,1021,5.462025316455696

This movie is magical, easily the best movie to come out this year. The backgrounds, the costumes, the acting, the special effects...I could go on, but you get my point, right?!?
When asked in an interview years ago what was his all-time favorite scene in all of his movies, Walt Disney himself replied, ""By far, the scene where Cinderella gets her ball gown."" That scene is perfectly captured in this film ~ along with so many magical moments I would never be able to recount them all here.

Regardless, if you're open to a film which touches deeply the sentiment of romance, family, love, and feelings... This is a show  you're going to enjoy...

For those who gave this just one or two stars... I sure am glad I don't live in that household... Sounds like there are quite a few ""WICKED"" step-mothers and step-fathers out there!!!",1446422400,,722,4.714285714285714

This live-action retelling of Disney's animated classic does gives the animated version a run for its money.

Of course some things could not be left out so they needed to use quite a bit of CGI to keep the story consistent with the animated version.

The only thing that carries t this production is the popularity of the actors in the direction of Kenneth Branagh. However it does not have enough Branagh and too much Disney in it.

In the DVD extras everybody pats each others back on the fact that this filled in the Backstory of the characters. They were also overwhelmed with their own sets filmed in the 007 movie studio.",1446249600,,866,4.640522875816994

6706428,4,B00O2IZPD8,"I think Disney may be on to something, taking beloved animated fairy tales and converting them to live action films.  Prior to this film, Maleficent is perhaps the most recent example.  Most didn't like that one but I thought it was quite good.  Like Maleficent, this Cinderella provides a bit of a back story.  We see how Ella (Lily James) lost her mother (Hayley Atwell) and was eventually orphaned by her father (Ben Chaplin).  We get a bit of history as to why the wicked stepmother (Cate Blanchett) got to be that way.  We see some byplay between the handsome Prince (Richard Madden) and his father, the King (Derek Jacobi) which provides some certainty to him being a perfect match for Ellas courage and kindness promised to her dying mother.

Those looking for further diversions from the original story from Disneys 1950 classic will be disappointed.  Director Kenneth Branagh and his screenwriter Chris Weitz play it close to the original save the fact, this isn't a musical.  One might criticize the special effects trickery that transform mice into horses or lizards into coachmen, but I don't know any better way to make it happen and stay true to the magical elements performed by the Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter, who also narrates).  Im guessing Ms. Blanchett had fun playing the horrible stepmother, looking out for herself and to a lesser degree her daughters, Drisella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger).  Shes a hoot.  Ms. James is perfectly cast.  Her performance as the newly named Cinder Ella has just the right amount of kindness and moxie needed to fend off the meanness of her stepmother and stepsisters.  Not to mention her 20 waist.  My only question has to do with the glass slipper.  When the Prince goes looking for the maiden who dropped it at the ball, seemingly thousands of young women are lined up to see if it fits.  The last one to try it on was Cindy of course and it fits.  I find it hard to believe, a shoe wouldnt fit someone else in town.  Cinderella is a beautifully made film that includes some nice performances, gorgeous sets and costumes and is entertaining from beginning to end.

Getting the Blu ray package is certainly the way to go.  The transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and an original 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The films wonderful color comes across perfectly.  Not so much that it appears garish, but bright and natural.  Skin tones are well presented and natural looking.  Black levels are ideal.  Contrast and detail excellent.  I could detect no anomalies.  The audio is a stunner as well.  The disc includes a terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 option.  If these multi-channeled discs have a downside.  Its usually at the expense of the center channel with carries much of the dialogue.  I had no problem hearing or understanding the conversations at any point.  Surround effects are well done, nothing sounded unnatural.  The LFE (.1) channel was solid, especially during the sequences involving the pumpkin chariot trying to get home before the last strike of midnight.  Well done.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Here are the extras:

6706429,3,B00O2IZPD8,"I like this movie, but for some reason it left me a little unsatisfied, although I'm not totally sure why. Cate Blanchett did a great job as the stepmother and I like Cinderella, but maybe it was the prince? Maybe I was hoping for a little more story since it was a theatrical version. They stayed pretty true to the original Disney animated version, so it was pretty simple. I think maybe my problem is that I'm comparing it to Ever After as a Cinderella story which is more interesting, in my opinion. But overall, worth watching.",1446249600,,532,4.494845360824742

Each actor is splendid, an amazing score (the waltzes and polkas from the Ball particularly are astounding as original compositions), and the addition of ""Lavender Blue"" and it's recurrent motif throughout the score is pure mastery. Nonso Anozie is a giant of a supporting character and delivers two of my favorite lines (""splendid candor, Master Phineas"" is the other one).

6706548,4,B00O2IZPD8,"It was ok  I mean good lesson for kids to be kind even if people treat you badly also, I think the only sad part about it I guess is the part when the mean stepsisters rip apart CinderElla's Mom's dress. The people dress ok I personally would not dress like that because the dress top part is way to low in the front. It also teaches you that you should exept people for how they are not trying to change them onhow they act or look or anyything else. I think this is a great movie kinda boring at some parts and I would never buy the movie  just rent it see if you like it.

Okay, so I was wrong.  It was actually a well done movie top to bottom.  It had a decent amount of humor, good special effects, excellent acting, and the movie was consistently entertaining from beginning to end.  It had a slightly different take than the Cinderella I grew up with, but I enjoyed the changes.

6706588,1,B00O2IZPD8,"I watched this a few nights ago with my 9-year-old daughter. I really don't understand all the five star reviews for this. We both thought that overall it was very boring.
The prince, though very nice looking, had no spark. After watching him for about a minute, we started fast forwarding pretty much every time he was on the screen. It was much better that way.
Second, Cinderella's mother is on her deathbed and about to impart her words of wisdom for living. And those words are? ""Be brave, and be kind."" Seriously? Those are the words you want your daughter to live by? As the movie evolved and those words didn't always help Cinderella, I pointed out to my daughter that yes, you have to be brave, and yes, you start out being kind. But if someone is not kind to you, you have to kick butt.
Also, way too much back story on the stepmother. Perhaps hearing her whine about how things hadn't worked out for her was supposed to make us feel sorry for her. But I didn't buy it. Just because life didn't turn out the way she wanted, doesn't mean she can make her stepdaughter into a slave.
And about the father...he realized the stepmother wasn't a nice person, yet he plans to go away for months but does nothing to protect the estate that's been in his family for 200 years from her in case something happens to him? What a doofus. I know that's what happens in the classic fairy tale, but this is the first version I can recall where the father clearly doesn't like the stepmother but loves Ella. You'd think he would have protected her legally just in case.
We did love seeing Cinderella's magical dress. It was beautiful.",1445558400,12,1627,4.444816053511706

It was a role she could have easily phoned in and didnt. The handsome Prince played by Richard Madden was everything you wanted to see in a Disney Prince come to life!

Cinderella could have easily taken revenge for how she was so ill treated but she offers grace and mercy just as the Lord does through His Son (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-7).

6706687,3,B00O2IZPD8,"I realize this film got very many 5 star reviews, but I just didn't see it like that. It seemed well directed and produced and the actors did an admirable job with a simple, well known story but for some reason it just failed to keep us invested. Both my wife and son fell asleep during it, and didn't care about re-watching it, but my daughter and I plodded through it. Maybe it was just an off night for us, but as avid movie buffs, we were a bit disappointed. If you want to see a more enjoyable take on Cinderella, I recommend seeing Ever After, staring Drew Barrymore. It's a unique, fresh take on the classic Cinderella story that we've seen and enjoyed many times.",1445212800,13,671,4.333333333333333
6706688,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Kenneth Branagh's live action version of the Cinderella tale is delightful. Actress Lily James is exquisite in the title role, she convincingly portrays Cinderella's courage and kindness without being overly sweet. Cate Blanchett is equally outstanding as the bitter Lady Tremaine. Helena Bonham Carter brings some whimsy (to a film which isn't afraid to be dark when it needs to be) as a slightly daffy Fairy Godmother (who seems a bit overwhelmed by her magical powers). Richard Madden's Prince Kit is as charming as he needs to be and manages to flesh-out what could be a cardboard character. The rest of the cast (including Derek Jacobi and Stellan Skarsgard) is equally excellent but Nonso Anozie deserves special recognition for playing a very crucial role in the film as does Hayley Atwell who makes a strong impression in just a few scenes as Ella's mother.

The screenplay wisely incorporates several elements from the Charles Perrault version of the fairy tale which were not included in Disney's animated version. The film differs from the classic fairy tale in one crucial respect: Ella and Kit meet before the ball thus allowing more time for their romance to develop. The film is rated PG because of the deaths of some characters which are handled with sensitivity but may make the film a little too dark for very young children.

The art direction is sumptuous and the Blu-Ray looks great. I'm sure a lot of CGI was used to create the kingdom depicted in the film but it is done masterfully. The Blu-Ray includes several ""making of"" featurettes as well as several (wisely) deleted scenes. The short subject ""Frozen Fever"" is also included.",1445212800,,1654,4.946043165467626
6706689,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I admit to being a purist and I was NOT looking forward to seeing this movie because, really, how could this new Disney regime even consider messing with the classic animated film?  Begrudgingly, I went to the theater...and I was enchanted.  It was perfectly cast and Kenneth Branagh's direction was superb.  I liked it so much, I went back to the theater the next week to watch it again and bought the Blu-ray as soon as it was released.

This iteration is lovely, romantic and completely entertaining.",1445212800,,503,4.747126436781609

I know this is her true size with the addition of an extremely tightly laced corset. It sends a message to everyone that a fairy tale princess is not ""realistic"" to moat people.

6706720,3,B00O2IZPD8,"I loved the original cartoon version of Cinderella.  I also loved Ever After.  I wanted to love this version, but I didn't.  I liked that it mostly stuck to the original version ... except the added message...  I gave it every chance and was very hopeful, but felt disappointed and let down after watching it.  I even felt bored during parts of it.  I will say that the special effects were fantastic!  I loved the scenes with the fairy godmother turning the mice into horses, the pumpkin into a carriage, the lizards into footmen, and the goose into the driver.  I think Lily James played Cinderella well.  I think Cate Blanchett was perfect in the role of the wicked stepmother.  It was nice to see Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother.  I wish they would have spent more time on that part of the story.  Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger were fantastic as the wicked stepsisters.

I did not like the fact that most women in the movie seemed to have their waists corseted to such unnatural sizes.  It was really distracting.  Even Cate Blanchett's waist seemed very unnatural.  They made Barbie look more natural than they looked.

In addition, I liked the saying ""Be courageous and be kind""; however, I did not agree with how they showed to be kind.  Being kind and allowing yourself to be victimized are not the same thing - which I think this movie misunderstood.  Also, Cinderella stayed in the situation, because she said her father wanted her to love the house and take care of it.  If her parents charged her with caring for the house, they should have left the house to her.  Once it was no longer her house, I do not see why she would continue to allow herself to be victimized under the misunderstanding that it was how to show kindness.  Forgiveness can show kindness; being abused does not.  I can understand if the movie made the premise that she had nowhere to go or was afraid of being caught and punished, but it didn't.  At one point, Cinderella is running her horse through the woods.  I was so very hopeful that she was running away, but she wasn't.  sigh.

I just think the message went horribly wrong.",1445126400,4,2134,4.5473684210526315

I tried it on three different DVD players and got the same results - the only bonus features to show up are Frozen Fever and Ella's Furry Friends. I actually even posted a question on disneystudioshelp.com and they told me to call them to get to the bottom of the issue. When I called, they explained that the features vary from the DVD to the Blu-Ray, and since there is more room on a Blu-Ray, most of the bonus features are only available on that. To which I would say, um, hello false advertising.

While I totally enjoyed Ever After with its empowering message to young women, THIS version follows more closely the original animated version, and to me there's nothing wrong in bringing that to such amazing and beautiful life!

6706758,5,B00O2IZPD8,"My two daughters (age 7 and 4) wanted to watch this with me as a ""Daddy-daughter date."" They were very entertained. During some of the more intense parts they would squeeze me, laugh and tear up. It wasn't too scary or ""dark"" for them. It was perfectly balanced for their ages. They loved the costumes and the castles and animals. This was a great movie for my two girls who very much believe in the fairy-tale stories.
The best thought I can share is when my seven-year-old said that she liked this version better than the cartoon! How awesome is that?
If you're a dad and want a good movie to watch with your girls I highly recommend this. You're sure to get tons of cool dad points, and you'll make a great memory with your girls!",1444953600,,733,4.357664233576642

I loved this Cinderella! This was so beautifully told and acted out... I even felt bad for the stepmother. The message which kept playing over and over again ""have courage and be kind"" is absolutely so much better then so much of the disney crap out there. But one thing I would change - the fairy Godmother... Please choose someone who doesn't look so oddly plastic and evil to play a role that should be whimsical as well as soft and pure. I don't remember the actress's name but she behaves & acts like the female johnny dep pirate fairy. And the lizard carriage men were frightening. Absolutely cringeworthy- thats not a good thing for a Cinderella movie. Other then that, it was awesome.",1444867200,,851,4.605263157894737

Loved the animation and CG effects of the animal and pumpkin transformations-and the glass slippers were exquisite!  I want a pair of  my own.  Let's not forget the ballgown.

6706882,2,B00O2IZPD8,"I am so not the target audience for this disney film. but so many of my friends were starry-eyed over this movie, that i felt compelled to watch it. On the yay side - beautiful special effects and overall eye candy-ness. On the ftlog side - the characters were stereotypical to the point of ad nauseum. To disney's credit, they did try to pump in a little sympathy for the wicked stepmother, but it would have been a stroke of genius to maybe blacken cinderella's eye a little and make her a little bitchy.

In comparison, i loved disney's  2007 ""Enchanted"" - that was over-the-top and brilliantly so. This one is like eating a dozen donuts with candy sprinkles in one sitting...

but if you have little women with princess-y aspirations - this is the one.",1444521600,5,756,4.544117647058823

But, this junkie stuff with VIOLENCE AND SUCH seems to be what Hollywood is producing.

The closest I came was when the Step-mother was feeling sorry for herself.  I actually felt some pity for her situation, of course she was too mean and hateful to like. Anyway, it all seemed superficial to me, like not enough time was given for a true, caring story.  It's not a movie I care to watch again.",1444348800,,429,4.3924050632911396

I took my kids to it not expecting much in the way of entertainment for me personally, but knew the kids would like it.  By the end of the movie, I had laughed and cried and left feeling like a better person.  Not only did we go to it again in theaters, but as soon as it was available for pre-order I was one of the first to shamelessly cry ""shut up and take my money!!""  And yes, I'm a dude.

It's my new favorite Cinderella movie, and it has wonderful references to the older Disney animated one, which I really applaud, since that is dear to the heart of many of us older Cinderella fans.

6707001,5,B00O2IZPD8,"The ongoing motto of the spectacular, shiny new Cinderella -- a reimagining of the 1950 Disney animated classic. It's a richly detailed extravaganza that incorporates into its script elements of the earlier film, but adds more spunk to Cinderella -- the ending scene with her Stepmother and Stepsisters was much needed in the original. But it also actually tones down some of the most dramatic and intense moments in the 1950 film.

Most notably, the Disney-created ""mother's new dress"" sequence is downright horrifying as depicted by Walt and his artists. The abject cruelty is so deeply felt, the evil is more demonic that many of the other Disney villains, like Maleficent or the Evil Queen. It's physical and psychological abuse. In the new film, the actions are less pronounced and a little less dark, but it does produce the same emotional effect nonetheless. Maybe it was too intense to be done with live actors.

Speaking of the actors, they are hand picked for perfect roles. It's clearly Cate Blanchett's movie to dominate, and she is a slam dunk, adding a twisted, bitter reason for her evil -- a counterpoint to Cinderella's way of handling adversity. The stepsisters are still comical, and the mice are there, too.

I would have loved it if we could have heard Helena Bonham Carter sing ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" and Lily James sing ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" on the soundtrack. But the background music by Patrick Doyle is sweeping, elegant and just as magnificent as the scenery.

The castle is the visual centerpiece. Interestingly, the digital graphics are so convincing that one wonders just how elaborate the set had to be. Never mind -- they filled Pinewood's James Bond stage with grandeur.

One major story change was introducing Cinderella to the Prince early. This also happened in The Muppet Special, Hey Cinderella, in which she thought he was the palace gardener. Cinderella also encountered the prince early in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical version. It's a fine way to work the prince into the story more than he is in the animated film (princes were notoriously difficult to animate). It also comes as a bit of a relief to the viewer, as the opening sequences are filled with tragedy.

It must be pointed out that there is one other live-action Cinderella that compares favorably with this version, in that it opens up the story, adds political intrigue and actually takes the tale beyond the shoe fitting. This is the Sherman Brothers' exquisite musical, The Slipper and the Rose. Featuring one of their most sophisticated scores, this isn't quite as elaborate as the 2015 version, but it is highly recommended.

Blu-ray is a welcome medium to capture all the filagree, ephalets and taffeta and curliques.. There are also a few generous behind the scenes bonus features but no audio commentary (good grief!)",1444176000,,2849,4.935281837160751

6707159,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Lily James is excellent as Cinderella!  She is lovable and believable.  If you are expecting a reboot of the story from the 1950 version, don't.  Yes, there are some differences, but they are relatively minor (don't expect a Maleficent in terms of a rewrite).  That said, Director Kenneth Branagh absolutely constructs a world that you can't help falling into and staying relatively true to the story does not diminish the look or feel of the movie.  If you get the bonus features watch how much work it took for the ball scene and how much attention to detail is put into this.  At first, I wasn't sure how Helena Bonham Carter would do as the Fairy Godmother (used to her darker characters), but she did fantastic.  Couldn't imagine anyone doing that character better.  Highly recommend this enchanting take on a very old story.",1443916800,,830,4.755244755244755
6707160,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Just wonderful. I went with a young friend to see this when it was in the theatre, and we both thought it was divine. The costumes, the sets, the story--all were truly lovely. It must have been difficult for the main actors to take on such traditional roles without making them seem cardboard. But they were terrific! It was believable in almost every sense. Yes, there was some cheesiness, and a little saccharine sweetness in places. Otherwise, this was a great take on a fairy tale that has long relegated women to victims waiting for rescue. This Cinderella was not waiting for rescue. She also wasn't portrayed like so many modern day heroines, kicking butt and making smarty pants comments. This was a young woman who knew herself, and stayed true to what she really was.",1443916800,,777,4.720588235294118
6707161,2,B00O2IZPD8,"It's enjoyable, but slight. Ever After tells the same story with a good deal more depth and less saccharine.

EDIT: a few days after I watched this I found it ever more irritating. It's blatantly manipulative with the music and the long lingering emotive shots, and I hate that. The bits of characterization that are there work well enough, but ultimately I found all the characters too one-note to be believable. I've read quite a bit about this movie and about the Cinderella mythos, and there are a couple of arguments worth addressing here:
A) ""It's a fairy tale and things happen because fate decrees it so.""
B) ""When you've been abused it's an act of courage simply to allow yourself to be loved.""
Neither of these are *wrong* but I don't feel either of them justifies the shallowness of this script. In the fairy tales I remember best, the Grimm's versions, the heroines always took part in their own destinies. Ella here at least has a code and the sense to grasp an opportunity when it's handed to her--the bit where she pauses in front of the mirror and decides the prince will have to take her as she is, is nice. But I find it difficult to believe she would never rebel, even in small ways. They could have spent more time on the characters' interior lives and less with the visual pyrotechnics, but then that wouldn't be Disney.

You get out of it what you bring to it, I guess.",1443916800,5,1391,4.4940711462450595

6707186,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Cinderella Disney Studios 2015 Blu-Ray rated PG

Now I cant say that I personally watched this film.  Its just not the kind of movie I would sit through.  However I can guarantee the audience that it has the Emily seal of approval.  Emily is 5 years old, and she generally resists change.  She had seen the older version of Cinderella and liked it.  When asked if she would like to see the new version,  she of course said No!.

I waited for an opportune time and slipped the disc into the player and put it on a short included special, Frozen Fever.  [The movie Frozen was a BIG favorite of hers].  She was hooked.  She ended up watching Frozen Fever twice, Cinderella twice, and a short special about training the animals used in the film once, all in one day.

Although shes only 5 and the film has a rating of PG, there was only one time she was briefly upset.  That was when Cinderellas birth mother died, and she briefly got teary.  But in the course of about 2 hours of the movie, the short feature and the documentary, that was the only moment and it did not deter her from watching the movie a second time.  Therefore I think I can say, this is a suitable and engaging movie for most children.",1443830400,,1202,4.303571428571429

6707220,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Overall, one of the best live action Cinderella's I've seen as an adult.
Strengths:
(1) Great acting, especially by Lily James and Richard Madden but most everyone is good. Helena Bonham Carter's characterization is alittle over the top for me, but I love her work generally so won't ding her too much. Didn't care for a few closeups she got as she's preparing to send Cinderella off to the ball when they were near the carriage; a few shots too tight on her, especially when she says ""you will go to the ball"" (didn't like that reading or the eye makeup - the character looks deranged, wish they'd gone with a different take). The villains are solid and especially liked how story showed why Cinderella's stepmother had a problem with her, so good writing there. Maybe it took a star playing that role to get the writer to explain her behavior and as an audience I sure appreciated understanding her motivation. Stepsisters are pretty standard, good acting.
(2) Nailed the dress. Loved it, the way it fit Ms. James, the way the story and director gave it the time it needed. One of the most beautiful ball gowns I've seen in film in a long time. Loved the way Ms. James moved as it was magically being made on her, just that whole sequence was lovely.  Kudos to the director, the actress, the costume designer and sound designer.
(3) Nailed the shoes. They were beautiful, and I liked how the story had the fairy god mother say they were comfortable because that's something many women would wonder.
(4) Good music.
(5) Great to see characters of african descent in a Disney fairy tale movie and one with a significant speaking role. Would've liked to have seen more ethnic diversity.
(6) Nailed the dance between the Prince and Cinderella. Loved how they danced and reacted to one another in the dance. Great directing and performances by Ms. James and Mr. Madden. I don't remember seeing a film which shows so clearly two characters falling in love during a dance. Ms. James' performance is especially outstanding. Her character is in the moment and she effectively communicates what Cinderella is feeling. Great choreography. Also liked how the background characters behavior and response to their dance supported the scene. Very fine use of background action.
(7) Enjoyed the humor with the pumpkin, mice, etc. were turning back to their natural state. Nice use of humor throughout the film.
(8) Liked that the writer explained why Cinderella stayed in her situation, gave her a friend to talk to even though it was brief, helped story.
(9) Liked the relationship between the King and the Prince.
(10) Liked the first meet between Cinderella and the Prince.
(11) Liked the humor of the gentleman making royal announcements. He took that tiny part and added his own twist.
(12) Liked how the story showed in the Prince/Cinderella's second dance, when everyone else joined in, that these complex dances were part of their society. If the second dance hadn't been shown, might have wondered how Cinderella and the Prince could have danced so flawlessly together in their first attempt, but by having everyone join in with those complicated moves, and even the last dance we briefly saw as Cinderella makes a break for it at midnight, we are shown that the citizens knew these elaborate dance steps - this really helps and supports the story. Great that the writer/director knew to insert these additional sequences. It's not emphasized, but it's very important to story believability. Wish more writer/directors understood when an audience will want/need the story shored up.
(13) Loved Cinderella's wedding gown.
Weaknesses:
(1) Didn't like the first act, the little girl's part. Her acting was fine, I don't think the writer made Ella as a young girl interesting enough. That may make sense from the producer's point of view, as the movie is a vehicle for Ms. James, but as an audience, if I'm given a main character, whatever her age, I'd prefer she be interesting. Ella the child is not an engaging character. Also the parents were not interesting. As the film begins with these characters, there's not really much for the audience until the stepmother appears. The story has a weak start but fortunately a strong finish.
(2) Stepsisters pretty standard. Nothing different done with them. Wish the writer/director would've thrown them (and us) a bone. Cate Blanchett's stepmother got some love (i.e., her motivation was braided into the story), the stepsisters characters weren't as fortunate. Alittle twist, or even showing why they were so silly, would've been appreciated. Anything that clarifies helps.
For me Luke (in Star Wars), though male, is the best Cinderella I've ever seen. He had no dress but he had his land cruiser, his light saber, the force, and various other high tech gadgets. He even had a fairy godfather (Obiwan), but for a traditionally told Hollywood story, this remake of Cinderella is more than decent. Had they upgraded the stepsisters and done alittle better with the first act I'd have given them a five. Well done.",1443571200,2,5051,4.8938156359393234

Yes, the costumes are period pieces, but the Hollywood camera angles highlighting heaving cleavage is old. We can do without.",1443484800,2,434,4.64935064935065

6707244,5,B00O2IZPD8,I watched the movie in the theater. I really liked it and recently I signed up for disneymovierewards.com put the code in for all your Disney DVDs and Blu rays and You can build up points for cool stuff. Including the exclusive Cinderella necklace I bought for $9 plus $3 shipping. It'll take a while to ship but It's worth the wait. Put in the code by 12-22-2015 and you can also buy the charm coach necklace. When you buy Aladdin on Blu ray also (10-13-2015 release date pre order now on here) you can get a FREE charm bracelet with the lamp and shoe. Just pay $3 shipping offer also ends 12-22-2015. I highly recomend getting these movies as soon as possible. When I bought the necklace it said 6-8 week wait. I'm not sure about the bracelet. I'll also be writing a review on the Aladdin Blu ray explaining this agian,1443484800,11,820,4.366013071895424

And I didn't care for the choreography at the ball...was too stiff for my taste.  But a thoroughly enjoyable visually vibrant film,1443312000,,329,5.092592592592593

6707316,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Although I personally wasn't excited about watching this Cinderella remake, my better half was and like the old saying goes, If momma is not happy, then no one is happy., so I watched for the sake of world peace ;-).  With that being said, this movie is beautifully done with fantastic scenery and special effects.  It is not always that a remake can be done as well as its original, but the modern effects brought to this movie, made it worth watching just for those alone.  The acting was solid and to me especially notable was Blanchett as the stepmother.  Disney does a great job at combining the modern effects with a very classic feel of the old Disney movies.  It was something I didn't think was possible, but rather remarkable in the effort made for this movie.  The story doesnt really bring anything new to the classic romantic fairy tale but of course it is Cinderella so that wasn't expected so much.  I think my better half enjoyed this more than me, but I do give credit where it is due as a remake that manages to keep the classic feel and bring some great visual effects.

Whimsical and endearing the cast did an excellent job Cate Blanchett was wonderful as the wicked step mother.  You almost felt bad for her.  Almost, ha ha.

6707337,5,B00O2IZPD8,"An improved ""traditional Disney"" Cinderella. A beautifully rich visual film. All the characters are enriched with more back story, more dialog. From the King to the cook. Kit (Prince Carming) is a person rather than an icon. Cinderella's sophistication as well as her oft mentioned ""courage and nice manner"" show in every scene. She has class. She cares. She doesn't quit or forget who she is. The fairy godmother is a hoot! As is the pumpkin carriage. Lucifer and GusGus appear in smaller roles. Best additions are Kit's dad the King and some of the royal court. Intrigue and honor...

6707339,3,B00O2IZPD8,"Beautiful dresses and glittery shoes aside, this one doesn't shine all that bright. First, it is definitely a Disney movie with nothing new to add to a classic story. Cinderella herself is very forgettable and bland, quite perfect for a doll line. Prince Charming is charming enough, and even shows some traces of personality. This is not a comment on actors playing these roles, only on writing that does not even attempt to make them characters in their own story, they are, what they always have been, props to move the story forward. The real shining stars here are, to no surprise, Cate Blanchet and Helena Bonham Carter. Both of them somehow manage to imbue their respective characters with life and depth with subtlety of true masters. Couple of glances from these two, and the magic is there. I only wish that evil stepmom has met absent godmother at some point. I would watch that movie. It's masterfully directed by Kenneth Branagh, but at this point I believe that he was able to do it blindfolded. The story is comfortingly familiar and painfully unoriginal at the same time. Nothing new, but nothing really wrong with it either.",1443225600,7,1141,4.7969543147208125

6707351,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Only Disney would have the audacity to attempt a live-action remake of an animated classic, and to play it fairly straight as a romantic dramawith even less comic relief than the original. And only Disney could pull it off.

Everyone knows the story of Cinderella, so its really a matter of how the story is told. I think the studio made the right call. They decided to craft an origin story: to fill in the information gaps, to flesh out the characters, and to focus on the romance. The devil is in the details, but detailsand devilish characters, for that matterhave always been Disneys strong suit. Cate Blanchet plays the stepmother with the same complexity as Angelina Jolies Maleficent, the backgrounds are as striking as anything youve seen in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the interiors of this live-action feature rival what we saw in Disneys animated Beauty and the Beast.  I wouldnt say the CGI elements are seamlessyou can certainly tell that the lizards and mice are computer-generatedbut they're cute as the Dickens.

Scottish actor Richard Madden (Klondike, Game of Thrones) plays the Prince, but Lily James (Downton Abbey) is even more charming as Ella, nicknamed Cinderella by her stepmother after shes found lying next to the hearth to keep warm. Its easy to become as captivated by Ella as the Prince is, enthralled by her fresh optimism and live-by mantra: to have courage and to be kind. In other words, Cinderella has an inner strength and beauty to complement her physical good looks, and Disney drives home the point that whats inside matters more. The screenwriters also are mindful of the Disney princess brand as they suggest that while little Ella wasn't royalty, she was a princess to her mother and father, who loved her very much. And Disney being Disney, death is handled matter-of-factly. Way of all flesh, boy, a dying father tells his offspring.

If theres a surprise, its that the live-action stepsisters (Sophie McShera, Holliday Grainger) aren't as broadly comic as they're often played, and that the fairy godmother is played a little more comically by the incomparable Helena Bonham Carter, who has as much fun with this role as she did playing Disneys Red Queen in the live-action Alice and Wonderland.

In this version of Cinderella theres much more development of the Prince and his relationships. We see him interacting with a captain of the guard (Nonso Anozie), a manipulative Grand Duke (Stellan Skarsgard), and his father, the King (Derek Jacobi). Collectively those interactions make the pairs coming together more satisfying, and more than anything else the live-action Cinderella is a grand romance that does for this fairy tale what Neuschwanstein Castlethe inspiration for Disneys theme-park castlesdid for all of them: it celebrates the magic, the majesty, and the happily-ever-after ending that everyone, deep down inside, still craves.

The characters, the story, and the wonderful details will make this a repeat play, no matter how familiar it is. Dont hesitate to add it to your collections. You may know the story, but, like Hoosiers, its somehow rousing every time you watch. Family Home Theater is happy to report that the Blu-ray features a flawless and room-filling DTS-HDMA 7.1 soundtrack (which, surprisingly, is song-free except for one number that Ella and her mother sing) and a gorgeous-looking 2.39:1 widescreen presentation that really pops in HD.

Bravo to Kenneth Branagh for a straightforward, retelling that is absolutely captivating!

This is Disney at its finest.  You can immediately take one glance at the exquisite cinematography, animation, costumes, art direction, and  know there is no other studio that has that magic touch.

If that ballroom dance scene doesn't take your breath away even the slightest bit, you aren't paying close enough attention. Lily and Richard have a wonderful chemistry. Cate Blanchett was divine as the beautiful but wicked stepmother. And Helena Bonham Carter's turn as the fun and feisty fairy godmother was perfection.

Major theme: Have courage and Be Kind

This is the straight story, with mice turned horses; lizards turned footmen, and a goose for a coachman.

The backward transformations are awesome.

This is shot in blues and greens, with the stepmother often appearing in venom-colored clothing.",1443139200,,352,5.566037735849057

And let's not forget the seamstresses of those incredible dresses - that heavenly wedding dress and the mesmerizing ball gown with a life all its own - the movie would not have been the same without that beautiful blue dress.  My only issue with the film was that Cate Blanchett was given top billing over the star - Blanchett was terrific, as usual - but she wasn't Cinderella and the movie was not titled ""Wicked Stepmother!""",1443139200,,560,4.704081632653061

6707607,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I was absolutely blown away when I went to see this in theaters with my sister. This remake-reimagining really delivered a classic ""Disney"" and magical feel! And it offered new elements, too.
  The coloring in this movie is FANTASTIC. I've never seen a movie so colorized in my life! It's almost like you could taste them. The choice of Cinderella, Lily James, shines as both the servant her stepmother made her to be as well as that mystery girl at the ball. Cate Blanchett was absolutely perfect for the role of the stepmother. She was much more glamorous and dazzling than the original's, who was a mean-spirited hag. And I can't begin to describe the movie's costume design! Each and every costume was PHENOMEMAL! Sandy Powell, costume designer, is a genius when it comes to creating outfits that bring out the personality of the character.
  Overall this movie outdid itself with its creativity, imagination, and lively feel that we all expect from a Disney movie. Cinderella (2015) indeed brought classic Disney back to life!",1443139200,,1031,4.908045977011494

6707610,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This is the first time I've written a review on a movie.  I usually don't care enough to write a review, but if there is any chance Disney will see this, I want them to know that I want more movies like this.  Movies that have a simple principle that is taught and repeated throughout the movie for emphasis and is taught in a powerful way by great actors.  Movies that aren't full of that fads of the day to give it edginess.  Movies that you can watch with your kids and not feel like you just wasted 2 hours.  Movies that have a few twists and turns to keep it interesting, but still teach truths that are valuable for our kids to learn. It was so well done that I loved the whole thing.  This movie gives me hope that there are still great movie writers out there.  Well done, Disney!!!!",1443052800,2,791,4.1644736842105265

6707612,5,B00O2IZPD8,"The first time I saw the Trailer for this movie, I was instantly excited as a huge Disney Movie lover, and apprehensive.  I remember thinking that the casting looked awesome, but the story seemed like it would be bland compared to the singalong animated classic I grew up with.  Even as the movie starts out you are missing the singalong elements, but somehow you fall further in love until you're simply brimming with a quiet joyful contentment by the end (the kind that comes with a truly happy and well deserved ""happy ending"").

It's just enchanting, and I was delighted and surprised with how well paced the movie was and how it kept me interested all throughout, despite not having any real melodrama or big theatricality.  Somehow, as if by...dare I say...magic, the movie manages to be enchanting and draws you in just in its simple story telling (OK and set design and wardrobe, casting and acting).

Acting roles that should be cliche are fresh and new because they are 3 dimensional. Lily James manages to be perfect and somehow you can't be frustrated at her for just taking the abuse, seeing as how you can see hints of the subtle insidiousness of Lady Tremaine and her daughters.  She is both tender and outwardly timid but she has a clear and definite inner strength and sense of self that carries her through it all and its portrayed fairly and believably.  Cate Blanchette is perfect as Lady Tremaine, being both severe, cold, and beautiful and pitiable.  She doesn't redeem herself but she has much more depth than just being ""the villain"".  Jeff Adler was freakin perfect as Prince Charming or Kit, and I can't write this review without saying that even being a huge Game of Thrones fan I was astonished when I thought ""Damn he looks familiar!"" and IMDBd it to find out he's Robb freakin Stark. I think I didn't recognize him because he's always smiling and is clean shaven in Cinderella.  He looks like two totally different people, and I guess at least partly a testament to his acting skills (and also he looks sooo much like a young Ewen McGregor).  Ok now that I am done being a fangirl, he really did do a great job being both charming and truly lovable because while he is noble and brave, he's not prideful. The romantic exchanges between Kit and Cinderella are so sweet and bely a truly deep burgeoning love at first sight, it really is a fairy tale come to life, and because its production is not over the top it's that much harder to have it end and give way to real reality.

This will definitely be one of the ones I replay a lot, well worth buying the HD version on Amazon.",1443052800,,2606,4.556745182012848

6707615,1,B00O2IZPD8,"Disney's live action Cinderella is a 5 star film.  It is a shame the DVD & Blue Ray did not live up to the high standards of the film.  Promoting an additional 12 minutes of footage and deleted scenes was very misleading.  Yes on the Disk there is a deleted scene of  Cinderella's Childhood and it  is very good and should have been left in the film , but the extra 12 minutes  deleted scenes are on the digital copy only and it gives the idea that the digital film is actually 12 minutes longer than the Theater release and is longer than the Disk copy of the film.  Not so .  The additional 12 minutes are not in the film and they are presented as deleted scenes .  These 12 minutes of outtakes are not  on the DVD or Blue Ray Copy.  So if you think the Digital copy is a Directors ""longer "" cut you are wrong.  All deleted scenes should have been on the disk . If you say a movie includes 12 minutes of film not shown in Theaters it should be in the movie not  as  deleted scenes after the film.  Shame on you Disney , did not expect this type of misleading  promotion from the Magic Kingdom!  Took 2 hours to get the down load and then watched the movie  expecting more and got the same as the DVD / Blue Ray.  As for the deleted scenes most were better left on the cutting room floor ; although Cinderella in the kitchen taking the tray to the  stepsisters should have been left in along with the Funeral and Rage picker scene. Both would have made the movie  a lot better in the first half.  I know Disney tries to hit all ages from 5 up to adult with every film ; but hopefully Disney will issue a directors cut and include the best of the removed scenes !",1443052800,15,1663,4.067901234567901

6707617,5,B00O2IZPD8,"For me this was one of Disney's better live-action movies.  Not only is it faithful, at least to the cartoon, but it provides some interesting back story on how Cinderella came to live with her stepmother and also why the stepmom is so cruel.  The costumes are gorgeous, the humor is not over the top and for me, the story was great.  This is one I'll watch more than once.  Highly recommend!!",1443052800,,393,4.416666666666667

6707620,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Cinderella is a powerful film starring Lily James as Cinderella, Cate Blanchett as the Stepmother, and Sophie McShera as Drisella and Holiday Grainger as Anastasia.  Ellas early years while her parents (played by Ben Chaplin and Hayley Atwell) were in her life are nearly charmed and idyllic. Ellas father is a wealthy merchant who works abroad. Ellas mother communicates an important message to her to be both brave and kind. However, Cinderellas life is turned upside down once her stepmother begins to control her life. Meeting the Prince (Richard Madden) is one of the bright spots in her life.  The Captain (Nonso Anozie) is a close advisor of the Prince and takes on the role of a protector and lookout for the Prince who shows in different ways in how he is only trying to help the Prince. The Prince has a close relationship with his father  (Derek Jacobi). Helena Bonham Carter and Stellan Skarsgard also play significant roles in Cinderella (and obviously) there is so much more to the movie than the details I included here for good reasons.  The bonus features to the film; Ellas Furry Friends, Frozen Fever (via Walt Disney Animation Studios;One of the sisters decides to prepare a birthday party of the other sister in Frozen Fever). There are also short snippet images for Hero 6, Monster Inc., Tinkerbell, advertisement For Disney Movies Anywhere, Trailer for Disney Natures Born In China (featuring Panda Bears and a setting that looks like the wild forests of China, Im only guessing and I understand that it could be something else).  Trailer for an exclusive all new short film titled Rileys First Date, trailer for the Tomorrowland movie, and an emphasis on the fact that all films and promotions may not be available in all territories.",1443052800,,1758,4.905723905723906

My mom liked the part where Cinderella's dress turned blue and sparkly but I liked the part where the green house exploded and the fairy god mother said ""Do you think I meant to do that?""

6707634,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This was precisely what Cinderella should look like. Excellent graphics, great casting, acting, and even the screenwriting wasn't bad, for once. This film enjoys a coherent story line that makes sense, and great acting by the stepmother & stepsisters; they really made you dislike them. And it was totally clean, good family fun. My entire family was surprised Hollywood would allow such a good movie to be made in the year 2015. There wasn't much, if any, of the anti-family, pro-immorality, or even climate change activism we see permeating virtually everything Hollywood does these days.

Sure, the movie wasn't perfect, but that's only from the perspective of a perfectionist. Most people won't be able to find flaws without attacking the lack of anti-family, pro-immorality propaganda. This is a wonderful film just perfect for the family, so long as it is the theatrical version. I haven't yet seen any other version, so I can't speak for those. You never know what will be inserted in a 'director's cut' or 'extended edition.'

Good, Clean Family Fun! Watch this unless you hate family-friendly fare and happy endings!",1442966400,,1125,5.108695652173913

6707638,5,B00O2IZPD8,My daughter loved seeing it in the movie theater and it is a good rendition of the Disney classic with reality added to it. Definitely a movie for all ages. I can't wait to see Disney's next transition from animated to live-action,1442966400,,230,4.5
6707639,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Kindness to others, though sometimes a challenge, is sometimes easy when compared to what it is to have the courage to be kind to one's self. Disney's live action adaptation to this ageless tale does a wonderful job highlighting this truth.

Kindness to self allows for trust and forgiveness. What a beautiful telling of this story.",1442966400,,332,4.928571428571429
6707640,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella is a triumph. In recent years I have devoured the products of the onslaught of live action nostalgia driven reboots. This film stands a cut above. Cinderella, a character who has been largely dismissed in popular culture for maybe seeming vapid, so much so she would 'marry a man she just met', absolutely shines as strong and unyielding feminist heroine. Not in the progressive sense, she's not wearing a suit of armor (Alice in Wonderland, Snow White and the Huntsman) or wielding a sword (Mirror, Mirror) but to paraphrase her mother, 'has more kindness in her little finger than most people have in their entire being'. That is her 'power' her 'magic'. That, along with her unrelenting commitment to have courage in pursuit of kindness, is what allows her to over come her well known misfortunes. Being orphaned, reduced to servitude, psychologically abused by her step family. Not only does she conquer this but protects the prince and the entire kingdom from geo-political intrigue. What strength of character! What an iron will! As for the film itself, the performances are wonderful, sets breathtaking and costumes transfixing. Of course the costume designer deserves an Oscar and Cate Blanchett deserves at least a supporting actor nomination for her role as the Wicked Stepmother. She was able to add so many layers to the character. Unsympathetic, cruel but contemplative. A timeless vignette of the struggles between women. Branagh's visual story telling is amazing. Cinderella observing the ashes on her face, sharing her food with mice, standing on the ballroom steps looking glorious. It's effortlessly done, not heavy handed at all and captures the magic of the original animated film.",1442966400,,1730,5.204301075268817
6707641,5,B00O2IZPD8,"We saw this when it was first released in the theaters. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

They managed to change the story enough to keep it fresh but still kept the spirit of the story intact. I felt the actors all did a very good to great job. The art direction and costumes were superb as well. Cinematography was innovative as well. I thought the sound was very well done and certainly enhanced the story. As many of you know there are many different versions of this story. The first written European version of the story was published in Napoli (Naples) by Giambattista Basile, in his Pentamerone (1634). Some written versions have a silk slipper and other say the slipper was gold. In some stories patch (or tar) is used to 'trap' one of the shoes which the prince than uses to find her.

There are, quite literally, several dozen stories that use the basic Cinderella themes.

This Disnefied  version seems to be a mix of many stories with some Disney magic on top of that.

I thought that, just like with Malificent (Sleeping Beauty retelling) they took the original source material and turned into a fresh take on a old and well-known story. I would rate this a very high 8.75 to 9.25 out of 10 - highly recommended for Cinderella lovers (which includes almost all women above the age of 15) or Disney lovers in general.",1442966400,,1349,4.534979423868313

6707646,2,B00O2IZPD8,"I love all Kenneth Branagh's movies, and I was looking forward to seeing what he can do with the Cinderella story. Unfortunately, it all came up to a big fat zero. The movie is boring, overly didactic, a poorly matched pastiche of excessively weepy and incongruously light-hearted episodes. The symbolic aspects - for example, the branch that Cinderella's father was supposed to bring back - are not followed through, although it's a must for any self-respecting fairy tale. Also, what's with the dress? Cinderella makes such a big deal of keeping her mother's pink dress intact, and then gleefully allows it to be turned into a completely different one, not even a souped up version of the sentimentally charged original.

I was slightly shocked by the expected CGI scenes depicting animals turning into humans and back: supposedly a tender-hearted person, Cinderella didn't flinch when magic started throwing her innocent companions up in the air, inspite of the terrified expression on their faces.

One thing the movie has going for it is the fabulous costumes. They reminded me of Nina Ricci designs for the eponymous ballet.",1442880000,,1130,5.102702702702703

6707650,1,B00O2IZPD8,"Not going to summarize the plot because, of course, we all know it. But it's not the plot that made me keep looking at my watch while watching this movie. I found it boring because it had adults in their mid to late 20s acting like immature 11-year-olds in terms of  navet and perception.  No, I'm not someone who doesn't like kids movies. To the contrary, I watch them all the time. And I'm not an advocate of how mature and sexualized preteens are today, but it was just weird and tedious to have an adult 26-year-old and an adult 29-year-old acting repeatedly like kids who hadn't yet entered middle school.  Not charming.
Moreover, there must be a way to demonstrate ""be kind""   half of what Cinderella's dying mother exhorts her to do    without being a victim who ignores the second half of her mother's dictum   ""be courageous"".  I'm not saying she never was never spunky. But this Cinderella equates being abused & being forced to  wait hand and foot for her appalling step-family with being kind.  In addition to promoting the usual problematic female aspirations of having the smallest foot in the land and waiting for a prince to chose you, this film has a new unpleasant, unhealthy message for girls: cinderella's cleaning the house her parents loved for other people who demean and hurt her now becomes the role or mission of a female person respecting her parents legacy. Ugh.
Got to say that I found the 1998 ""ever after"" version  of this fairytale much more magical than this one, even though this 21st century version has the CGI magic of turning pumpkins & mice turning into an actual carriage with horses!  Also that 1998 dress with wings was so much more  delightful and inspiring than 2015's blue flounces on a woman who had been corseted so painfully that social  media lit up with claims it was computer-generated and the actress sounded positively Victorian as she talked repeatedly about being unable to breathe in her interviews.  Is that kind of insane, unhealthy body image something to encourage during these times of epidemic preteen bulimia and anorexia?  I love fantasy, but, come on, this was ridiculous.
Lastly, every time Richard Madden smiled, I thought, wow, that's a lot of blinding teeth instead of ""isn't he gorgeous"" as I did in his other roles. Way too white new caps, perhaps?",1442880000,22,2319,4.7525

Complete with Satan (cat) and the Gus Gus (mice) crew. My only complaint is that when I think of Cinderella and her Prince Charming, I think the prince should've been several inches (at least) taller than Cinderella. He was equal height, if not a bit shorter when she wore her glass slippers. That's just my female petty mind, but if we are talking fairy tales, I'd want the whole package. It was a lovely movie with a great message to ""Be Courage, Be Kind"" and I love that. Definitely worth the watch and an add to the movie collection.",1442793600,,661,4.426229508196721

6707675,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I opted to wait to see Cinderella until it was at one of the budget theaters in my city because the previews didn't really suck me in enough.

I have to say, this falls into one of my favorite movies.  I am going to admit it, I am a huge fan girl of Cate Blanchett and she was ahhhmazing as Lady Tremaine.  Lily James plays the part of a sweet girl amazingly well and is a stunning Ella/Cinderella.  Sophia McShera as Drisella was hilarious and her singing part was hilarious.  Of course, Holliday Grainger as Anastasia was fantastic.  Now.. Helena Bonham Carter is ALWAYS a joyful addition to a film.

Of course, this is about Ella and Prince Charming.  Richard Madden (love him as Robb Stark in GoT) and Lily have fantastic chemistry and I loved every scene with them.  My favorite? The dance scene, naturally.  It's absolutely breathtaking.  I've never been much into the whole Prince Charming thing but...  Richard Madden's Kit is one I would love to have.

The scenery, the costumes, the music, the choreography and the entire cast were all beautiful done.

Instead of focusing on Cinderella marrying a prince she's just met, and the prince wanting to marry Cinderella for her beauty after dancing with her for just one evening, the movie develops the relationship on a deeper level.  Throughout the movie, Cinderella demonstrates the power of strength and forgiveness.  The movie's message to ""Have Courage and Be Kind"" is powerful and inspiring, especially for young girls. There also is good use of humor and well-defined characters.  The Cinderella character was not depicted as perfect and unrealistic, but rather inspiring, gracious and compassionate. She chose to rise above her situation and forgive her stepmother even after the cruelty that had been bestowed upon her. Despite being treated so poorly, she felt sorry for the stepsisters for their demeanor and inability to be anything but self-absorbed. She chose to be Courageous and Kind, rather than bitter, vindictive, and spiteful. Even when her own world was falling apart, she took a step back from herself to help the old woman who asked her for a drink. The prince falls in love with her not just for her external beauty, but for her inner beauty and integrity. If that isn't a good message to send to young girls, I don't know what is. There should be more role models like her character in our society. Disney has gone on to promote ""A Million Words of Kindness"" campaign based on the theme of the movie. http://www.cinderellakindness.com/  All in all, a real pleasure to watch!",1442534400,3,1609,5.056603773584905
6707712,1,B00O2IZPD8,"On a positive note--Incredible job on costumes and those glass slippers ROCKED.

Beyond that I found myself sitting through this movie wondering when it would ever end. In my opinion, Cinderella was again depicted too sappy-sweet and unrealistic.  In other words, in this day and age and given the fact the movie had actual actors, I would have hoped they could broaden the characters with a bit more depth.  People are people.  Nobody is all good or all bad, but rather multifaceted.  It certainly would have made it easier to relate to the characters.

I also noticed Cinderella's waist was ~unnaturally~ small--not unlike a Barbie doll.  Not a good message to send to young girls.

I purchased this movie for my 4-1/2 y/o granddaughter who also had trouble sitting through it.  On that note, that has never been an issue for her with 'Frozen' which she first saw in the theater at 2-1/2 y/o.  This means if I'm lucky I may never have to see this movie again.",1442534400,6,961,4.666666666666667
6707713,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Cinderella is a live-action remake of Disneys 1950 animated classic which, in terms of production values, far outshines its predecessor. The film expands on the traditional story of orphan girl Ella (Lily James, Downton Abbey) who is forced to act as servant to her cruel stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and stepsisters (Holliday Grainger, Sophie McShera).  They give her the name Cinderella because she is often smudged with cinders from cleaning the fireplaces. Though Ella is sweet and tries her best to get along, she is constantly put down and treated badly, yet in typical Disney fashion, keeps her spirits up and remains optimistic. When the prince (Richard Madden) holds a ball, he opens it to all eligible young women of the kingdom  nobility and commoners alike  hoping to find a suitable partner for marriage. With the help of her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter), Cinderella is outfitted in a beautiful dress and provided with a sparkling coach and horses in order to attend the ball.

The movie is refreshingly politically incorrect, as Cinderella is literally swept off her feet by the dashing prince. This Cinderella is not a feminist or female-empowered young woman. Ms. James adheres to the traditional story and makes a lovely Cinderella. She is all innocence and purity, and she sells these with no trace of irony. Computer generated magic is utilized sparingly, mostly in cutaways to Cinderellas mouse friends and the impressive changing of a pumpkin and assorted animals into the coach, driver, and footmen. Ms. Blanchett is appropriately sinister as the stepmother, taking her place in the pantheon of Disney villains.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include the theatrical short Frozen Fever, over 12 minutes of footage not seen in theaters, and 4 behind-the-scenes making-of featurettes. A digital HD copy is also enclosed in this 2-disc set.",1442534400,,1882,5.198019801980198

6707716,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I only just saw this movie on pay-per-view the other night. I will most certainly order it. Of course, I remember the Disney animated classic from my childhood, and that movie will always be a cherished nemento of my past. This movie maintains the integrity of the story and even improves upon it with a more humanistic approach to some of the characters. For example, the stepsisters are not funny looking as they were in the cartoon. They are pretty if a bit tasteless and overdressed, thereby illustrating the point that true beauty is on  the inside. The secial effects in this new movie are, as you would expect, dazzling. Kenneth Branagh and his team took this film to new heights. Wait until you see te pumpkin turn into ta coach! The mice and brds are more realistic than they were in the cartoon. They do not speak... or sew. Performances by the young cast are lovely. The Prince is handsome and Ella is beautiful and sweet. You will see some familiar faces in the supporting cast including Derek Jacobi as the Old King and an actor who has a principal role in ZOO on TV. Helena Bonham Carter plays the Fairy Godmother with dash and style. Best of all is Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother! I don't know if it was intentional or not, but she channels a middle-aged Joan Crawford in  her portrayal. This is the Joan of Queen Bee and Harriet Craig. She's steely and mean in her form-fitting satin dresses. She has bright red hair and even brighter red lips. She's wonderful. If there is anything that i missed from this version, it's the songs. The score is great but I might have preferred something a little more whimsical. After all, it's a fairy tale. The movie was so good that I sat through all the closing credits. I'm glad I did! Helena Bonham Carter sings ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" and the actress, Lily something, that plays Cinderella sings ""A dream is a wish your heart makes"" Don't miss this one.",1442534400,,1917,4.58600583090379

6707766,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I spent all of Tuesday waiting impatiently for work to end so I could go home and rewatch this magical film.  The actors in this film bring the characters to life better than anyone's imagination.  Cate Blanchett has a true calling as the wicked stepmother, but is so good that one can't help loving her!  The Prince captures one's heart and makes one believe in not just fairy tales, but true love.  Cinderella embodies the good of the world without being unrealistic while the stepsisters bring humor to the film with their ghastly singing, poor taste in couture, and schoolgirl bullying.  However, the Prince's right-hand man, Cap, is the true star of the movie.  He constantly fights for justice and supports the whole cast in their personal journeys.

This film deserves many an Oscar nod, but most definitely for the costumes.  Cate Blanchett's wicked stepmother has meticulously designed clothes that scream ""twice widowed without a hair out of place.""  If there were a clothing line to come out of this movie, it would be the stepmother's.  Her fitted skirts have luxurious trains and her blouses are perfectly fitted and modest.  Every piece it tailored to look immaculate and top-notch.  The much-talked-about Cinderella dress is the epitome of Disney magic.  I very much appreciated Disney keeping with the transformation scene from the original film and adding a modern twist to the classic dress.  It is obvious to even the most untrained eye that hours of hard work and planning went into the design of the dress. There is beautiful, flowing movement from all directions and the dress shimmers, as if Disney magic flows through the threads.  It truly will be hard for Disney to top this film!",1442361600,,1706,4.916083916083916

6707785,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I loved this version of the classic fairy tale. I can very much relate to Cinderellas story as I have lived a similar life. From being loved by my parents and having pass at a young age, to living with a verbally abusive relative, to being married to a wonderful man and having all that I need and could ever want.
The most poignant portion of this version is that no matter what happens to her that her step mother could not break her or ruin her and that her Mother's advice of being kind and having courage is something she actually lived and that karma came back to her in the end.
Also the fact that she did not need rely on the Prince for her ultimate happiness, but rather herself and the experience of her meeting the Prince was enough for her to be happy and continue on.

The casting is perfect, the pacing is great and didn't leave me bored at any point, and the few additions to the fairy tale were extra incidents which didn't change the course of the story. The story is very much the traditional story, and takes advantage of its feature-length format to develop characters, which makes it a more powerful movie. Lily James plays Cinderella with more character than I thought possible. Cinderella in this movie is an optimist, but she struggles at several points with sadness and anger about being mistreated, and always looks to the memory of her kind deceased parents to assure herself that her stepmother and stepsisters are wrong about her. Because we see how she handles her emotional struggles, not just when shes not allowed to go to the ball but through a series of incidents before that, this version of Cinderella rises to the level of a serious drama.

6707791,5,B00O2IZPD8,"'DISNEY' bring the enchanting and age old story of Cinderella back to the screen, of course their delightful
full-length cartoon was introduced to the world back in 1950.
The story tells of how 'Ella' faces tragedy at a very young age with the loss of her beloved mother and how
she promised to always have 'Courage and be Kind'
Years past, her father (Ben Chaplin) thought it time to re-marry...to widow (Cate Blanchett) who had two
daughters 'Drisella' (Sophie McShera) and 'Anastasia' (Holliday Grainger)
'Ella' (Lily James) doesn't really get on with either her Step Mother or indeed Step Sisters, but tries to honour
her mothers memory by being kind and thoughtful toward them.
Her father, a merchant often goes away on business sometimes for months at a time...when 'Ella' receives
news that her father had fallen ill whilst travelling and won't be coming home her world seems to collapse
around her.
Without the money coming in 'Ella's' Step-Mother dismisses all the staff employed at their home, 'Ella' becomes
a servant to her Step-Mother (Cate Blanchett suitably wicked and cruel) and Step-Sisters, they start to mock
'Ella' calling her 'Cinders' - 'Cinderella'
Whilst out riding one day in the woodland 'Ella' meets 'Kit' (Richard Madden) who was hunting at the time, what
'Ella' didn't know was that this charming and handsome young-man was in truth - The Prince
Enchanted by his meeting with 'Ella' the Prince suggests to his father that the forthcoming 'Ball' should be open to
all, of course 'Kit' hoped that the maiden he'd met in the woodland would also attend.
However not wanting her daughters to be upstaged by the now, servant of the house, the Step-Mother forbids 'Ella'
to attend.
.......enter the Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter)...........the rest as they say.....is indeed History.
A charming adaptation of the tale, delightfully and magically brought to the screen by the Disney-Studio's.....long
may they continue to do so.
Much to admire throughout, a genuine Family-Movie.

In that light, Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella may come across as the rebellious beast. His movie anchors itself mostly in reality yet steeps itself in the enchantment brought about by a good and kind heart. This is a star-making role for Lily James who has such a glow about her that someone had best bring a geiger counter. She brings Ella into vivid life. She's generous and warm and doesn't trade in barb for barb. Her Cinderella is a pure character. There simply is no snark in her. She embodies the essence of the fairy tale. James is a huge why this is the best ever live adaptation of this fairy tale.

- ""Her step-mother-to-be was a woman of keen feeling and refined taste, and, she, too, had known grief. But she wore it wonderfully well.""

But for two, the cast is composed of splendid performers. Cate Blanchett is always a threat to dominate every scene she's in. She is - and I'll have to use caps - INCREDIBLE as the decadent Lady Tremaine who becomes Ella's step-mother. Lady Tremaine's backstory is mostly hinted at, but there's enough there to lend depth to her, and you can see where the cruelty comes from. I enjoyed how Blanchett played her with such relish. Richard Madden's Prince Charming - or ""Kit"" - and Ella have a meet-cute encounter, but it works in that it sort of erases that insta-love between them should they had just first met in the royal ball. I'm just glad Robb Stark gets a shot at a happy ending. Was I the only one, when Ella and the Prince were dancing at the ball, anxiously awaiting the strains of The Rains of Castamere? Anyway, Madden nabs more screen time than did his animated self in the 1950 version. The ever versatile Helena Bonham Carter is the upbeat and slightly daft fairy godmother, and, for those concerned, don't be, as she doesn't go the full Tim Burton route. Carter also provides the voiceover narration. Who else? Derek Jacobi is excellent as the ultimately wise monarch (King Charming?). Nonso Anozie - he plays the captain of the army - is such a warm guy, why isn't he more in movies? The two fails are the two actresses who play the snotty step-sisters. I guess they were supposed to play for laughs, but they just come off as super-aggravating.

It's a lavish retelling; it's a subtle retelling. It keeps faith with the animated film yet introduces new scenes that flesh out the characters and develop their backstory. We're made privy to just how close young Ella was to her mum and dad and we learn of her ailing mum's parting words to her: ""Have courage and be kind."" Advice that will see Ella thru her travails. I like that the plot takes the time to document the gradual deterioration of Ella's place in the household, the awful diminishing and then loss of her privileges, until all that's left is the much put upon scullery maid. The horror of it creeps up bit by bit, and I couldn't help but cringe when the step-mom first darkened the threshold because I knew the avalanche of mean for which Ella was in store. I've heard how feminists are calling to arms about this movie, of how they denounce Ella as meek and passive and subservient, how she doesn't stand up for herself. And I say, ef that. Not every person is fated to be a firebrand, not every person is like Drew Barrymore in Ever After. I like that Ella stayed the course, stayed true to her mother's dying words. I'm proud of Ella for rising above every challenge, above every cruelty extended to her, with grace and dignity and with a great spirit. I think that she does stand up for herself.

Branagh's sense of theatrics lends itself well to the film. He plants his once upon a time ensemble into an Old World European setting and makes it seem seamless. The production values are sumptuous. The set designs! The costumes! The unfortunate tights worn by my man Madden. But even a manly man like me can oooh and aaah over Ella's dazzling blue ball gown. See, I love it when a movie commits itself full out. There is no snark in Ella and no snark in this movie. Its identity is that of an old-fashioned fairy tale. It wears that badge proudly. And, because of that, it takes flight and soars. It posits that there's still a soft spot in us for those old stories wherein two people could fall genuinely in love and find grace in each other's presence. For my money, the best, most romantic scene in the film is when Kit and Ella dance in the palace ball room, just them giddy two, surrounded by a horde of dazzled and envious spectators. A lesser man than me may well have swooned at such rapturous spectacle.

6707810,4,B00O2IZPD8,"A while back, before home video, Disney would re-release their animated classics every decade. This practice helped accomplish many things. A new generation was exposed to these classics, helping to drive a new group of customers to the theme parks and movie theaters. And in an era of less than stellar animation, these re-releases helped to provide family fare and helped Disney retain their hold on theater space. Then, home video created a new market and they began 'releasing from the vault' titles on a more frequent basis, because there was a new generation of kids out there who could become potential customers. The new parents would dutifully buy copies of ""Dumbo"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", etc. for their children. Also, VHS tapes seemed to have a more finite life. The introduction of DVDs made these titles more long-lasting. And now, with everything going digital, they don't have the same bursts of revenue streams they once had. Their solution? Recycle the animated classics into new live-action films. Initially, this probably seemed like a gamble, but with the enormous success of some of these titles, the gamble appears to have paid off and they are dutifully working their way through the canon of titles, reintroducing the Disney Princesses to a new generation.

The success of the live action films at Disney is a little hit and miss. Some of the adaptations of non-fairy tale animated films and some of their theme park rides (the folks at Disney would turn the turkey legs they sell at  the parks into a movie if they could) are hit and miss. For every ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" there is a ""Haunted Mansion"", for every ""101 Dalmatians"" there is a ""Herbie"". But with these live action fairy tales - they seem to have stumbled upon a great formula. ""Maleficent"" borrowed a page from all of the 're-boot' nonsense currently going through Hollywood and told the tale of the villain from ""Sleeping Beauty"". It was a role custom-made for Angelina Jolie and it became a huge success. There will probably be a sequel. Now with ""Cinderella"", they take a more straight forward approach and the results are even more dazzling. The film is already a huge hit prompting the studio to announce a live action ""Beauty and the Beast"" with Emma Watson, Emma Thompson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans and Kevin Kline.

Actually, the success of these live action fairy tales really shouldn't come as a surprise. A while back, the Disney marketing machine began branding all of the 'Disney Princesses' together, making them a huge juggernaut and reinforcing their images in the eyes of young girls everywhere. All girls of a certain age have to stop and meet the Disney Princess they love during a park visit.

All of these marketing machinations would make me more critical if the film weren't so good.

Directed by Kenneth Branagh and written by Chris Weitz (writer of ""About a Boy"", ""The Golden Compass"" and co-director of ""American Pie"") with production design by Dante Ferretti and costumes by Sandy Powell (both of whom have worked on a lot of Scorcese's films), ""Cinderella"" is simply one of the most sumptuous films I have seen in a long time. Every detail of the animated film seems to have been reimagined in bright, vivid live action.

Spending just a minute, lets look at the costumes and production design. Ferretti has recreated all of the elements of this world, giving them an overly romanticized burnish - othey seem real but also seem to be ripped out of a children's book. The house where Cinderella lives is big, filled with the treasures of her father's travels, but also dusty and a little neglected. Most would be happy to live there as is, but when Cinderella's new stepmother and stepsisters arrive, they look at the house with undisguised contempt and Stepmother announces she will begin to redecorate. The Royal Palace is also beautiful and regal and the design seems to be both borrowed from a specific time period yet somehow it also seems unique. There is always something to look at and keep your eyes wandering across the rich tapestry.

Powell's costume designs are richly and inherently tied into the characters, adding another layer of detail to each. The connection of the color to the character might be a little too obvious, but if it weren't there, it would seem like a missed opportunity. Stepmother loves to wear green and chartreuse and the deigns of her outfits is clearly influenced by the 1950s. In fact, one of her dresses looks exactly like something Lucille Ball wore frequently in ""I Love Lucy"". The Prince wears spectacular white and blue uniforms, his devious Grand Duke wears black. Each of the stepsisters wears an outfit with ridiculous matching patterns and only a slight deviation in color. And then there is Cinderella's ball gown. It is magnificent. I read a quote from Powell where she states she wanted it to look like watercolor. She succeeds - a beautiful blue dress lined with crystals that sparkles and shimmers whenever Ella moves.

Branagh is a great actor and a very good director. ""Cinderella"" is a fine accomplishment he should be proud to add to his IMDb profile. He takes a perfectly cast group of actors and helps them achieve performances that are both believable and true to the source material. He and Weitz smartly provide us with more backstory - for instance, we meet Cinderella's mother - but they also keep references to the mice and animals - Cinderella has named the mice and they have a couple of interactions, which thankfully don't include the mice talking to one another. While the more incredible moments are still here, Branagh seems to hint at them making them seem more real and less important than they did in the animated feature.

When you have Cate Blanchett and Derek Jacobi in your cast, everyone else will benefit from their proximity. Lily James (Lady Rose in ""Downton Abbey"") plays Ella and seems to have perfected the blend of wide-eyed, simplistic optimism necessary to bring the role to life. It is interesting to watch Cinderella grow throughout the film. Initially, she is a loving and doting daughter ready and willing to accept everything her mother and father tell her about the world. As life's tragedies strike, you can sense that she is trying a lot harder to retain these same qualities. When she finally gets to the big Royal Ball, you can see her eyes light up with some of the fresh-faced enthusiasm that once seemed so unbridled  at the beginning of the story.

Blanchett is simply perfection as the new Stepmother who is so jealous of Cinderella, preferring her two daughters (Sophie McShera, Daisy in ""Downton Abbey"" and Holliday Grainger, TV's ""Bonnie and Clyde""). From the moment Blanchett walks on screen, an air of disappointment seems to charge everything around her. She doesn't like her new husband's estate and begins to redecorate, to make it less dreary, she begins to host parties and flirt with the male guests, she doesn't like the attention her new husband lavishes on his daughter to her neglect.

When Ella's father dies, Stepmother takes over and completely changes the household, to Ella's detriment. But Ella tries to retain her sunny disposition and this seems to upset her Stepmother even more because she cant break Ella.

Blanchett smartly keeps her performance more low key, making it seem more realistic and therefore scarier. She does not rant and rave and throw her hands about. When she is looking away, her face is a mask of seriousness, melting away as she turns to address Ella. She is mostly smiles, but there is a definite menace lurking behind the plastered facial expression.

John Madden (""Game of Thrones"") cleans up well and is suitably charming. But there is a restraint here as well and it seems more natural and real than you might expect. If Branagh is the director, Derek Jacobi will pop up somewhere and here he plays the ailing King. Stellan Skarsgaard plays the Archduke, intent on arranging a strategic marriage for the Prince. And Nonzo Anosie, a recognizable character actor, plays the Captain, the Prince's companion.

And no version of ""Cinderella"" would be complete without the Fairy Godmother. Here, Helena Bonham Carter has fun with the small, but pivotal role, adding a little touch of fantasy to an otherwise more realistic telling of the tale.

This version of the fairy tale is really quite good and the accolades should rightfully begin with the technical. But Branagh doesn't stop there and mixes in some very good acting from his stellar cast.

That scene where Cinderella tells her father what she wants him to bring home with him from his trip really destroyed me. But I've always had a soft-spot for father/daughter things.

Now I love the cartoon, but in reality a grown woman talking to mice and animals and saying they're her best and only friends is just kind of sad and weird. Not only that but the step-mother was actually quite nice until she overheard her new husband and step-daughter saying how much of a pain her and her daughters were. And even when the daughters were being their bratty selves they weren't really that bad just kind of annoying which is normal in any family but the cinderella in this story made it seem like the step-sisters were the dregs of humanity. It all seemed very forced and like they hoped the costumes and sets would make up for the terrible script.",1434844800,7,1107,4.512437810945274
6707816,2,B00O2IZPD8,"By retaining all the ""classic"" elements of this fairy tail, this version of Cinderella reinforces all the worst old fashioned notions about feminine passivity.

Cinderella's mother tells her to ""have courage and be kind.""  Well in this story that mainly translates to: have no agency, allow people to manipulate and take advantage of you, and wait until a rich man and/or magical fairy comes along.  While there is merit to this protagonist's ""kindness"" she ignores overt abuse by her step-family to the point of absurdity; and good fortune just falls into her lap, if anything only based on her phsyical attractiveness.

In the real world for most girls, frollicking around and singing is not going to get you very far.  Young girls should not be taught that subservience will be rewarded.

I would recommend Drew Barrymore's, Ever After, which retains the classic elements of this film, but updates the sexist ones, by giving Cinderella great agency and a deeper context.

I don't remember them being that blue in GoT.) Helena Bonham Carter was adorable as the fairy godmother. Another aspect I really loved was the touch of diversity in the cast and extras.

6707820,5,B00O2IZPD8,"While most live-action re-imaginings of classic Disney films fail to capture the same spark of wonder as their source material, ""Cinderella"" is a rare case of reinvention that is actually more satisfying than the original. Created during the tight post-war years, Walt Disney's ""Cinderella"" (1950) never quite reached the same pinnacle of fairy-tale story and style achieved by gems like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" or ""Sleeping Beauty."" Director Kenneth Branagh's live-action confection is the film Walt Disney would have made if he had had the budget.

Rather than attempt to modernize the story  la ""Frozen"" or ""Maleficent"", Branagh instead looks for inspiration in Perrault's original tale, lending the film an appropriate storybook look and feel. For all the criticism being leveled at him for sticking to the traditional path, the truth is that the world loves a good fairytale, and when you've got a timeless story like Cinderella with five-hundred years of love behind it, there's really no need.

With that being said, ""Cinderella"" is anything but stodgy in its presentation. While the basic story isn't fundamentally changed (aside from the removal of the songs), the presentation is so fresh that it's like seeing it for the first time. The combination of screenwriter Chris Weitz's excellent script and the top-notch British cast allow the characters to be properly fleshed out and emerge as much more than the usual cardboard archetypes. It would be hard to find someone better suited to play the titular character than Lily James, who retains Cinderella's optimism without becoming saccharine. Richard Madden is appropriately dashing and handsome as the Prince, while Cate Blanchett is equally sinister as Lady Tremaine. But my favorite of all is Helena Bonham Carter, who brings a wonderfully dotty, doting presence to her woefully small yet spot on portrayal of the Fairy Godmother.

While this is the first film version of Cinderella I've seen that wasn't a musical, I can't say it's a bad thing. Patrick Doyle's regal and romantic score more than adequately fills the void, and the lack of character's suddenly bursting into song allows more time to develop the characters and storyline, something that further grounds the story into a more serious kind of reality. Following Walt Disney's maxim that ""for every laugh, there should be a tear,"" it is virtually impossible to get through this film without shedding at least one tear.

Visually, ""Cinderella"" is one of the most lavishly beautiful productions I've seen in a long time. The whimsy of the animated version is kept well intact, yet magnified to an impressive scale. From the gilded splendor of the palace to the otherworldly beauty of the moonlit garden, there isn't a single shot that doesn't succeed in taking your breath away. The transformation scene is a major highlight, as is the ball scene, which showcases Sandy Powell's gorgeous costumes to perfection.

Far more timeless and enjoyable than most 21st century attempts at fairy-tales, ""Cinderella"" is a more than worthy addition to the Disney canon, and one that I hope will be appreciated by generations to come.",1434326400,5,3156,5.166340508806262

6707828,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This characterization of Cinderella is wonderfully gorgeous and does not go astray from what we already know, just adds more body to the beloved fairy tale of the 'captured' Princess to be. Since my own childhood, this telling narrative has always been my favorite of all the struggling Princess themes. There have been many renditions since my favorite original movie and this one done in a dramatic scope with well-defined character portrayals including the right amount of gleeful magical tones was a joy to behold. I had been anticipating viewing this movie having no clue who was in the director's seat. Finding that this comes from the screenplay of Chris Weitz and is directed by Kenneth Branagh, I had to see this on the big screen. I certainly was never disappointed while viewing. There was neither a scene nor a character that I did not fully enjoy. Making another new anecdote of Cinderella come to life was quite a bold move, but I felt this worked very well.

Lily James as young Ella has the sweetest disposition and a loveliness all her own. She portrays her perfectly, as much as she becomes her completely then does an equally stunning Cinderella that always looks on the bright side later. A much loved by her parents, daughter Ella makes a promise to her Mother before her passing to be courageous and always to be 'Kind'. It is this innate kindness that carries Cinderella through thick and thin as she loses her father also much too quickly and must greet a whole new family, and what a trio this family is. Having to deal with this Stepmother and these two stepsisters would be overwhelming for anyone else, but not for Cinderella. She keeps the Promise to her mother and is kind to them no matter what and lives happily with her magical little friends of birds, horses but mainly her mice.

Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Tremaine, the 'evil' Stepmother is flawless, perfect and appreciated for it. Along with her nasty cat ""Lucifer"", just watching her tossing back her head and laughing her tone-deaf, toe curling shriek is priceless. The woman is horrid and just plays more manipulative and vile as the movie goes on. There is no softening of her personality toward her stepdaughter, she only grows worse and worse. Stepsisters, Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) are not caricatures as they were mainly portrayed in the past, but are more pretty on the outside and look less foppish or clumsy but also are degrading toward Cinderella and certainly ugly on the inside where it counts. They are equally condescending of her, spoiled but true to life of how rival sibling sisters would be. These two do a great job of stepping down on their stepsister and all three of the stepfamily give awful a significant punch of believability.

The Handsome Prince is portrayed by Richard Madden. Along with Cinderella, they are perfectly cast together, young and innocent who have their family at the heart of them. The two of them agree about courage and much kindness and you can easily see how they feel about each other. They meet on horseback in the forest while 'Kit' is being begged not to bring down a stag on his hunt where Cinderella does not give her name and the prince hides behind his father's name for him. He needs to find her later and cannot. In a guise to find her again, he sets out to plan the Prince's Ball to allow everyone to come - including all untitled maidens in the Kingdom as he looks for a bride being heir to the throne. The King (Derek Jacobi) and the Grand Duke (Stellan Skarsgrd) are each different in regard to the throne of their small Kingdom. One is more softened in his heart while the other is stuck on the Prince marrying for ""Privilege"" and not for love.

Helena Bonham Carter's performance of the Fairy Godmother is the comedic highlight in the film. What she adds as she whips around the garden with Cinderella while readying her for the Ball is exceptional. Choosing from all of the different items around them and changing up herself first. Can she begin with a ""Watermelon""?  Nope - a 'Pumpkin', lizards, mice, a goose but mainly dressing Cinderella adds all of the magical wonders that are so fun even jubilant but necessary to the story of Cinderella. I couldn't take my eyes off her. She looked lovely and magical herself all in a shiny shimmery white and with a semi-bumbling carefree nature. What she does just brings the fascination at this time in the film including fireworks with a Bippity Boppity Boo. Listen for this line at the very end of the movie along with a quip for a little laugh from this Fairy. Cinderella is off for one enchanted evening wearing ""Comfortable"" Glass Slippers (The Fairy Godmother is ""Good"" with shoes) along with the Prince.

The scenery, indoors and outdoors, is so well-done (Haris Zambarloukos) and all of the splendid visuals are luminous even if they are murky or own a more ominous tone. Fabrics are vibrant, plush even dingy and all of the sets are decked out in their finery. All of the costumery shows off for the camera in their jewel tones, lavishness, and monochromatic coloring. Each character is dressed to impress throughout for their comparative scenes with each little detail being well shown, even the little animal friends come alive in front of your eyes especially in the garden scene along with the Fairy Godmother and Cinderella. The soundtrack (Patrick Doyle) rises and falls while featuring different stringed instruments along the storyline and compliments all that Cinderella undergoes. It was not difficult to see how much care went into the making of this version of the favorite fairy tale story of Cinderella ...
A masterful triumph by all ... And a new delightfully full and delightful making of the fairy tale of Cinderella.

6707834,5,B00O2IZPD8,"""Cinderella"" 2015 is Disney's live action version of its 1950 animated classic. Director Kenneth Branagh does a generally marvelous job updating the characters and the story without slighting the magic of the original. An outstanding and mostly British cast does the honors, with help from some excellent CGI effects.

The story begins with the young Cinderella, raised by loving parents through a charmed childhood in which she is allowed to exercise her imagination while taught to have courage and show kindness to others. The death of her mother, the arrival of a stepmother and two stepsisters, and the death of her father leave her as much abused servant in what was once her home. A chance meeting with the young prince of the realm leads to an invitation to a royal ball and to a meeting with her fairy godmother. Her fateful encounter with the Prince at the ball will end up changing everyone's lives.

Most viewers already know the story, but this movie makes its mark with its execution of the familiar. The characters are three dimensional and interesting, even the evil stepmother, played with malice of forethought by Cate Blanchet. The scenes in which Cinderella's fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) prepares her for the ball are both funny and magical. The ballroom sequence is breathtaking and romantic in the best way.

6707836,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Cinderella was my favorite princess as a little girl. She was so sweet and good despite her unfortunate situation. So when I heard they were going to make a live-action version of Cinderella I was both excited and nervous. After seeing Malificent the year before I was nervous they would ruin my beloved Princess story or make her a sword wielding feminist. I was pleased that the storyline was essentially the same as the animated version with a deeper character development. I especially loved how they made Cinderella a modern princess for young girls without making her have to wield a sword or kick-box her way through an army of fully armored men. Instead she was true to herself and her belief of the good in all people. She was brave an courageous in a quiet sweet way. Proving that women can be strong in their own right without taking on qualities of a man. And I loved how our beloved Prince got to have a personality and a story of his own. What a beautiful relationship between him and his father. This movie was more then just the story of love between two beautiful young people, but also about the love story between parents and their children.
The entire movie was a beautiful masterpiece of story-telling, acting, music, sets, costumes, and old-fashioned fantasy and charm. Enough to make any true Disney fan at heart to smile and say, ""Now that's the story I loved.""",1430265600,22,1385,4.6571428571428575

Unlike Robert Strombergs retelling of a vengeful fairy, Kenneth Branagh as director of the new Cinderella movie opted for a simple approach to the source material. In short, not much is added to what we know about Ella and her glass shoes. Not much is changed, either.

And it works despite of  or because of  that approach. After all, Branagh knows he doesnt need anything extra when he has a great cast at hand. Likable Lily James plays the mistreated girl of the title, while Richard Madden is charming as Prince. Helena Bonham Carter is amusing as Fairy Godmother, but what is really amazing is Cate Blanchett as the mean and manipulating step-mother. There is no sentimental softening of her character (and don't miss her final scene).

But the most impressive part of the film is Sandy Powells beautiful costume designs and Dante Ferrettis gorgeous production designs.

The end result is you don't get a good look at anything. One big blur of Extremely bright colors and glare. I really wanted to like the film.

Lady Tremaine, once again widowed, starts treating Ella as a servant after she dismisses all the other workers in the house to save money. Anastasia and Drissellawhose never-ending bickering is annoying at bestname Ella Cinderella when seeing her face covered by cinders after sleeping next to the fireplace. Meanwhile, in another part of the kingdom, a bachelor prince named Kit (Richard Madden) struggles with his responsibilities as the heir of the throne, a position that appears especially weighty in light of his fathers intensifying illness. Ella and Kit cross paths and love happens. In order to avoid marrying a pre-determined princess for the sake of the kingdom, a ball is planned with every eligible maiden in the kingdom invited. Its now Ellas chance to impress the white privileged prince and to get her happy ending and marry him.

Although the story is slightly more faithful to the original tale, the little additions don't add enough material to make Cinderella worth the time. The cast, on the other hand, are the true gems of this film. Cate Blanchett is a very compelling Lady Tremaine, whose bold character is greatly vulnerable to false depictions and weak portrayals. Her character is tragic, devastating and even worth sympathy, and we get to see reason behind her ruthless behavior and actions towards Ella.

The Fairy Godmother, (Helena Bonham Carter) on the other hand, needed more development instead of over-the-top costumes and CGI effects. Its hard to respectfully portray the lovely Fairy Godmother in the original animation, but Carters casting in the role feels rather more gimmicky than reasonable. As for Lucifer and the mice, I believe it was a good choice not to let the mice speak in human language, yet Disney managed to keep the memory of those scenes by recreating their unique sounds and having Ella talking to them, believing than animals understand humans.

One of the elements standing out among others is the costumes and their borderline appearance between reality and cartoon. It was also my highest appreciation that Disney used almost the entire color palette in order to make Cinderella colorful and pleasing to the eye.

If you're still a fan of the original animated feature, you should not feel threatened by this live-action remake. Cinderella is not a celebration of its history throughout the generations, but a retelling of a story that was built to be financially successful. Like the Fairy Godmothers magic, it won't last long but it will amuse you as long as it can. If anything is certain, Disney is back in the game and if Frozen doesnt make use of all its resources, we can expect to see more interesting live-action remakes to come.

This movie, Maleficent, and Frozen are the only Disney movies that I consider to have these elements in the 2010s.  Even the 2000s didn't have any that I consider to be on par with the classics with a beautiful soundtrack.  The last ones that I consider to be on par are back in the 1990s with a beautiful soundtrack are  'Beauty and the Beast', Aladdin, Pochohantas, Toy Story, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan, The Lion King, Fantasia 2000.

6707859,5,B00O2IZPD8,"We went to the movies four adults and four kids ages 4, 5, 8, 9.
All kids and all adults absolutely LOVED the way the story has been translated into
this form of art. We were all curious how they will manage to take the cartoon masterpiece
and turn it into a good film for all ages and yet they managed superbly.

Disney did it again! Took one classic and turned it into another classic.
This movie is going to VERY quickly became fav family movie to watch over and over and over
again. Unlike the cartoon tale that is directed to bit younger audience on the princess spectrum,
this movie is totally watchable by the whole family.

Because it is such a delight for the senses it is not a suffering to seat through this but it is a joy.

I am glad that Disney waited to make this movie till the special effects in the movie making are
on the level that allow to produce true visual magic on screen seemingly effortless and with
such a delightful results.

This movie is NOT special effects heavy as some recent movies and lots of room for
superb acting delivered by mostly UK actors who supplement this masterpiece movie
with masterpiece acting.

Absolutely loved girly princessy yet-multidimentional and full of real humanity
character portrayal of Cinderella, and Lady Tremain was done with such a class,
without overdoing it and so balanced, showing evil in a human without making
it grotesquish or monstrual.

It is truly the first movie that does not scare little ones...

Yet when you are thinking of taking to the movie very little girls age 4 or so
especially if they are going to the movies for the first time do what many others suggested
for the parents of the little ones - arrive after the previews and be mindful for some
less cozy scenes of sadness or intense emotions as they are being conveyed
from the screen in bit more convincing manner then those of cartoons and as such
can intimidate the youngest audience at times, however there is nothing really
drastic and of the kind as in Brave movie that send so many little ones out of
the theaters screening in fear after just few minutes.  Just bring some cozy
toy to cuddle for them and you are all set.",1428019200,3,2169,4.4873096446700504

6707861,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I remember when I saw the first advertisement of this film. It was a simple picture of a glass slipper and the word ""March"". My initial reaction? ""Oh God No!!!!!!"" If there was ever a concept that seemed like a cash-in, idiotic milking of a popular iconic piece of pop-culture, this was it. After the (to me anyway) horrific retelling of Sleeping Beauty that was Maleficent, I was all set to be hit by another brainless, fractured version of a classic. There could really only be two possible outcomes in my mind. Either a darker and edgier monstrosity, or a tooth-decay inducing vapid retelling for the kiddies. Later on I was informed that the magnificent Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth; Blue Jasmine) would play the evil stepmother. Whoa. Then I found out Kenneth Branagh was directing. The man behind the greatest (in my opinion) version of Hamlet? To say nothing of the wonderfully fun and entertaining Thor? That could be good OR bad. His old style of film-making tended to overdramatize and overact a bit (as Shakespeare is want to do), but he also has a strong grasp of actual film-making techniques that has led to some truly magnificent cinematography (Hamlet fried my brain with a close-up shot that ended in a long-shot in through a continuous pulling away during a soliloquy, and the court scene with the flower petals falling is iconic). Could it be that this would actually be a decent film after all? I was surprised when my wife wanted to see this film, but after sitting through Maleficent for her and seeing a trailer, I knew that I could get through the film if it was terrible, and enjoy it for what it is if it proved mediocre. I needn't have worried.

The Cinderella Legend

In my late teens and early twenties I have been subjected and educated by every version of Cinderella under the sun. I've seen the Disney animated version. I've seen the Lesley Ann Warren/Rogers and Hammerstein version, the Disney made-for-TV remake with Whoopi Goldberg, Brandy, Bernadette Peters and Whitney Houston, Ever After (with Agelica Huston and Crew Barrymore), the Slipper and the Rose (with music by the Sherman brothers and starring Richard Chamberlain). The Glass Slipper (with Leslie Caron), the 2000 made-for-tv-movie starring Kathleen Turner and David Warner (a favorite of mine), the hilarious and heartbreaking Jerry Lewis film Cinderfella, and yes, all the direct-to-video Disney sequels to the animated original and all the various TV show episodes of the story. My point? By now I ought to be completely sick of this story. And yet...I'm not.

The Cinderella Legend has elements in it that appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds. The belief that if you are a good person, and have a good heart, in the end you will attain what you most desire. Now, this being the oh-so-modern-and-cynical-world, people have criticized the core of this idea to the ground. What makes ONE person more special than any other? It's not good to teach kids that someone will magically hand them the solution to their problems. People need to stand up for themselves and make their own destiny. Princess or prince, people should not be objectified as a mere prize to be won when all obstacles are overcome. And it's not good to encourage people to believe they will live happily ever after when they marry a good looking person they barely know. Well...

The Film

I love this film, but not for the typical reasons. I love great cinematography. I love great film-making. I love use of color and light and correct framing of shots. I love the history of Disney when they used to create films that had a lot of heart. This film is a loving tribute and reconstruction of everything that made Disney the legend that it is. The beginning of the film has scenes that made me think of Disney films from the 60's. There is film grain, and a sunlit hue to many of scenes reminiscent of those classic family films you may have grown up with (like Pollyanna, In Search of the Castaways, and all World of Disney films you loved). At the start, I found this charming, but everything else a smidge forced (perhaps because the modern world is so incredibly dark in comparison). Just the same, as the film took it's time unfolding the backstory, there was a sincerity that came through to me and I found it touching, even if the acting was not quite strong enough to make my accept a few scenes entirely. Then, after a flash-forward the story proper begins, the charm of this film, and the skill with which it was made, drew me in completely.

Cate Blanchett is PERFECT as the evil stepmother, bringing wit, craftiness, smoothness, sharpness, and yet, deliciously hamming it up when appropriate. How do you portray a character who is at once a monster, yet not a caricature or so pure evil as to fracture your sense of belief? She nails it. You love her, you hate her, you feel sorry for her, you admire her, and you WANT Cinderella to defeat her not through nasty tricks but through the one thing her stepmother lacks, a goodness that comes from within.

The two step-sisters are likewise perfect. They are nasty, but mostly due to shallow stupidity rather than outright evil. They are simply two idiots spoiled to the point of rottenness, and it is very entertaining to watch.

The interaction with the animals was something I was prepared to hate, but the gentle cartoonish cgi critters are so darn cute and lovable that you kind of can't help but love their gibberish talk and cuteness (I can't believe I""m saying that). Truly, I can't see any way that such a strong element from the animated original could have been integrated without either reducing it to non-talking animals only there as a nod, or outright talking animals which would have ruined the type of world that was created. For what's it's worth, I love the gentle reminder the mice provide that it IS a world where a LITTLE bit of magic exists. It makes the magical resolution at the end less jarring.

The prince and his advisers are the most realistic, fully-fleshed-out versions I have ever seen in any version of this story. Instead of a cardboard cutout, a youth rebelling against authority, or someone taking pity on someone of the lower class, he has depth and understanding both of his situation and of the gravity of the decisions he is making. The interactions with his father in particular add great dramatic weight to everything else.

And yes, the quirky Fairy Godmother played by Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic. She's the old woman you pass on the road who turns out to be an enchantress. The crazy relative you has magic up her sleeve. And stay past the end credits and you'll even hear her sing!

The CGI in this film is beautifully done, if a bit over-the-top and over-long in spots. In general, the tone of it is right, enhancing outdoor shots and scenery to make everything more cinematic and gorgeous. It also adds some wonderful comedy elements to the transformation of the animals into Cinderella's ride to the ball. Speaking of which...

I had never heard of Lily James before this film, and from the trailers etc I was expecting another vapid blonde Disney Princess. I was genuinely surprised by the heart and depth she brings to her character. She is lovely yes, but more importantly she brings warmth and sincerity to her character that makes you like her, sympathize with her, and root for her as her story unfolds.

The Difference Between Good and Great

Enchanted was a turning point for Disney. They realized that if everyone else was going to laugh at the old Disney tropes then they need to laugh at themselves, or at least give those old classic storytelling elements a nod. This film is the culmination of everything Disney has learned since the original Cinderella. This film is thoroughly self-conscious and aware of every cinderella storytelling device from just about every version of the story ever. It's almost as if the writers and director watched every version of Cinderella they could get their hands on and tried to learn from every single one of them. There's literally no plot holes that I could find, no elements that didn't make sense. And there's nods to classic Disney History everywhere, with a crucial plot point hinging on version of the song Lavender Blue (from the old Disney film So Dear to My Heart).

This film is gorgeous. It's wonderfully written (with enough Jane Austin language to make it feel authentic and enough modern that kids wont' get confused), superbly acted, and has a perfect balance of drama, wit, humor, and heart-touching sweetness. The music is great, the characters memorable, and it's just a really, really FUN film.

But more than all that, this is great film. It's genuinely moving, deftly telling a tale of a Cinderella who is not afraid to run away, nor afraid to face her problems and patiently work through them. It features a handsome prince who has heartfelt discussions with his father, royal advisers who scheme behind the prince's back for his own good, and a stepmother who hates Cinderella for being everything that she is not. If you love fairy tale films, this is a must see, must purchase, must own, must view regularly film. It is in my humble opinion, the greatest adaptation of this story yet, and that's high praise indeed coming from me. It will make your heart soar, and might, just might, make you believe in magic again.",1427932800,240,9379,4.7483118477593615
6707862,5,B00O2IZPD8,"This is a 5 star GEM of a movie...can't wait to own the DVD!  ""Cinderella"" has always been my favorite fairy tale, since I was old enough to read or be read to.  It is a classic story about quiet strength and inner beauty...looking beneath the surface to figure out who a person really is.  Cinderella is relentlessly beaten down verbally and humiliated by her evil stepmother and jealous ""ugly"" stepsisters.  It is the jealousy and cruel behavior that makes them ugly on the inside, so the outer shell becomes tarnished.  This Disney retelling of the classic tale was flawless in my opinion, and believe me, my standards and expectations were very high after seeing the trailers and reviews.  The script had just the right balance of drama and humor.  I laughed and cried several times, meaning there is more to love than the stunningly beautiful and extravagant eye candy.  I loved all of it.  Everything about this movie was perfect: casting, acting, script, music, CGI effects galore....her floating, glowing ball gown was magical and in the most beautiful shade of blue I've ever seen.

Disney raids its back catalogue to give one of its most iconic tales a coat of live-action paint.

What did I think?

Director Kenneth Branaghs take on Cinderella doesnt stray too far from the source material, but plumps the story up enough to be interesting. Its a beautiful chocolate box of a film that gives its familiar characters a bit more depth (but manages to resist the urge to update by simply cutting-and-pasting modern sass onto fairy tale staples). Helena Bonham-Carters fairy godmother is a delight, but Cate Blanchetts wicked stepmother steals the show. Oh, and the Prince (Game of Thrones Richard Madden) wears some very, very tight breeches which can only be described as awkward.

6707865,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Both me and my 14 years old daughter we simply ADORED this film! I must even say more - I was actually IMPRESSED! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Making a really good film about Cinderella, especially in our rather cynical times, is actually much, MUCH harder than it could seem - but Kenneth Branagh absolutely aced it! This film remains quite faithful to the original story AND to the classical animated 1950 version - which by the way I always liked a lot. The story being well known, there is no need to delve on it.

The main pillar of 2015 ""Cinderella"" is quite obviously Cinderella. Kenneth Branagh's choice for this role turned out to be simply PERFECT. Young Lily James, whom I never saw in anything before (yes, I still didn't watch ""Downton Abbey""), is of course a very pretty damsel, but not exactly a Victoria's Secret level looker - that trap was avoided. She is also obviously very talented and she was clearly very well directed, because she delivered an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PERFORMANCE! This film being from the beginning announced as a lesson in courage and kindness, Cinderella should be courageous and kind - and she absolutely is!

I was really charmed by the ""classical"" interpretation of Cinderella character by Kenneth Branagh, unlike the recent horrible, abjectly grotesque ""feminist-revisionist"" visions of Alice and White Snow in respectively Tim Burton's ""Alice in the Wonderland"" and Rupert Sanders ""White Snow and the Huntsman"". Cinderella is a young girl who just wakes up to the adult life and she has all the vulnerability and charm of such a person. She is no shrinking violet though - there is actually tough, noble steel in her, but in a very feminine way it is wrapped in the warmest, softest velvet. And this soft, warm toughness, which we can almost feel on the screen, is absolutely charming.

Being a young girl barely out of her teens and having a kind and gentle temper, Cinderella is not very assertive - but she is not completely passive, definitely not silly and in fact less defenceless that it could seem. She is also honest and pure - she will not accept even an advantageous deal which she considers beneath her and the idea that she could very easily renege on her words once in position of force doesn't even cross her mind. This nobility and purity, which she maintains even if the price is suffering, make this character even more appealing. Last but not least, as with many a great jewel, one single small flaw in just the right place underlines even more the perfect beauty of the ensemble - there is a little teensy weensy drop of deadly cruelty in her, which she hides preciously and uses only against the right person at the rightest possible moment in the most efficient way... I will not reveal anything more about it.

Sorry to go on about Cinderella character, but I was so impressed that I have to say more. She is not yet 20 and didn't really meet many men in her life, and yet she already mastered instinctively lots of purely feminine wiles, which she deploys in an absolutely disarming, irresistible, innocent and yet terribly efficient ways... Courting and mating rituals are very much like a cat and mouse game - and if men say ""miaow"", curb their backs and sharpen their claws a lot, it hides only very poorly the fact that they ALWAYS hold the role of mice...))) And this film shows it just perfectly...))) EVERY SINGLE SCENE with her and the Prince is a purely delicious, delicate and yet sensual ritual mating dance (and that even when they just stand face to face saying nothing).

Come to think of it, the character of Prince in ""Cinderella"" is even more challenging both for the director and the actor - Kenneth Branagh however aced that one too. Richard Madden whom I also never saw in anything before (yes, I still didn't watch ""Game of Thrones"" either) was a good choice for the role - he is slightly older and taller than Lily James and certainly also an attractive guy, but in a quite manly way (handsome, not pretty). The scenario improved also this character significantly and Kenneth Branagh directed him perfectly and the final result is a very, very interesting Prince. He loves and respects deeply his kingly father (excellent Derek Jacobi) but grew up to be a man of his own - and once his decision taken, he will neither bend nor break under pressure. He could quite obviously and without much effort have any woman in his kingdom (and not necessarily for matrimonial purpose) but somehow it didn't make him into a jaded jerk or an arrogant spoiled brat - to the contrary, he is actually a polite, gentle man, mixing skilfully and effortlessly great dignity with a considerable sense of humour. He is also definitely NO FOOL and even if his heart is kind, he can be ruthless if situation really asks for it. Last but not least, the film leaves no doubt that he really falls for Cinderella from the first moment he sets eyes on her - HARD! His devotion being sincere and his commitment total, it is actually quite easy to find him likeable and cheer for him.

Helena Bonham Carter plays wonderfully the Fairy Godmother, giving to this character a very thorough helenabonhamcartery treatment. The result is a Fairy Godmother who looks and acts as Glinda from Wizard of Oz - but a Glinda who got no less than three really huuuuge margaritas before leaving for this assignment...))) I really, really liked this Fairy Godmother...)))

Cate Blanchett is excellent as Evil Stepmother and this character was also upgraded and improved, for the greatest pleasure of the viewers. We can understand her better than in the cartoon - she drunk a lot of bitterness in her life, she is fighting, valiantly but of course in vain, against merciless time, she is terribly stressed by threat of poverty and even worse, her two daughters are a terrible, terrible disappointment. I believe that Evil Stepmother really loves Anastasia and Drisella, but she is lucid enough to see that they are not only unappealing, but also so stupid, talentless, lazy, noisy, annoying and mean that their prospects of attracting mates without the help of a dowry (presently non-existent) are very poor. In fact every time they say or do anything they make her motherly heart shrink from pain and bleed from concern. That is probably THE reason why she hates so much Cinderella, who is not from her own blood, but who in the same time is everything she would wish her daughters to be... All that being said, even if the film allows us to better understand the Evil Stepmother, that doesn't make her any less evil. She clearly always was a very self-centred and terribly arrogant person. She despises the men, because thanks to her great beauty she found it always easy to manipulate them, but she sees herself also as grievously hurt by both men she married - because even if they adored her, they both died on her, which she considers as a betrayal and a personal insult...))) Even worse, her successive husbands dying prevented her from living high on the hog, to which she considers herself entitled and them leaving this world could even force her to make her own breakfast for want of servants - and that would be a fate to cruel to contemplate...)))

The mice play a smaller role in this film than in the animated version, but Kenneth Branagh kept them and they are an asset - but they also were modified. They are intelligent and clearly have a language, but for most time it is not something we can really understand (I was able to understand one short sentence). They can however communicate with their human friend and in a couple of scenes they will intervene - discreetly, but quite decisively. In tribute to the animated version one of them is an over-eating and therefore oversized young buck called Gus Gus - and even if during most of the film he just forages (a lot), in one scene he will definitely pull his weight...)))...)))...)))

The ball scene is DELICIOUS with Cinderella's dress being a kind of Weapon of Mass Seduction. Glass slippers are a splendour. The scene in which Cinderella proposes to Prince (he already did it before, very publicly) is absolutely MARVELLOUS and when at the end we see Cinderella in her wedding dress, well, in the theatre where I was the male part of the audience said ""Miaow"" in chorus - and the female part hissed and growled with jealousy and sheer hatred...)))

One more priceless treasure of this film is that any feminist watching it will scream in pain, then die and turn to dust, like a vampire exposed to sunlight...)))

I absolutely adored every minute of this film, I wouldn't mind see it again in the cinema and I will DEFINITELY buy the DVD (maybe even Blu-Ray) the moment it is available. ENJOY!",1427760000,3,8741,4.709614126880314

6707868,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Cinderella,let the magic begin.....
I'm so excited about this New Cinderella movie by Disney.
First of all I'm sure that this film will be compared to the classic 1950's Disney cartoon version,but stop right there you can't compare the two.
Cinderella is a classic fairy tale almost as old as time and each Cinderella film brings a magic all it's own to the screen which is why we enjoy watching the story being retold and refilmed so many countless times.
And this ""Cinderella"" film will exceed all your expectations.
It is a true Disney classic worthy of the Disney name.

Cinderella ""Ella"" is played by the charming and lovely Lily James just fresh from playing ""Rose"" on the enormously popular ""Downton Abbey"" show
Lily James fits the part perfectly like the glass slipper that fits Cinderella's feet.
She brings warmth to the character of Cinderella making her more then just a young lass that breaks curfew, attends a party,and marries a handsome prince.
She is a delight to watch on screen as is the entire film.

The cast that Disney has chosen is simply superb from the ever gorgeous Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother,the handsome Richard Madden as the charming prince with the stunning eyes
Who thankfully actually gets to talk this time around (In the original cartoon the prince did not have very many lines)
And last but certainly not least is the consummate actress Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother Lady Tremaine giving a performance as a character we all love to hate
because really what Cinderella movie would be complete without the wickedly evil stepmother always trying to keep Cinderella from attending the ball and finding her prince charming apparently always trying to keep poor Cinderella as a servant in her own household.
Can Lady Tremaine not pay for any servants to clean and care for the household duties or does she just enjoy making Cinderella suffer?
Although I'm not familiar with the ensemble casts movie and television shows
(since some of the other shows the actors/actresses are from are very graphic nature/adult television shows met for a mature audience)
I do think that Disney picked a lovely group of actors and actresses to portray this classic story.
Cinderella's dress is simply breathtaking as is the entire film.

My favorite scene is where Cinderella's dress changes from tattered rags to the magically magnificent ball gown thanks to her fairy godmother (both in this film and in the Disney classic 1950's cartoon)
What Cinderella story would be complete without her iconic glass slippers and the pumpkin coach everything that you ever loved about the original film is here and more!
This movie looks like Perrault's version of Cinderella come to life straight out of a storybook it is visually stunning a true masterpiece.
This is a film to watch with the entire family.
Some people might criticize this film not having a more feminist perspective.
But then I'd say that you're missing the whole point this is a fairy tale and there is supposed to be happy endings.
Also Cinderella worked hard and despite everything she remained a cheerful and pure hearted person.
I think she is a lovely role model for young girls and women to always believe in their dreams!
Cinderella most certainly earned her prince charming and her happy ending!
Overall I think Cinderella teaches us the power of kindness and that if you're a good person then good things will happen to you.

Yes, some of the characters are given more backstory and at least the appearance of more depth (mostly the step mother and sisters), but ultimately you have a little girl/young woman that can talk to mice who meets a young prince with a toothy smile riding on a horse and falls almost instantly in love.  With Kenneth Branaugh directing and Cate Blanchett co-starring you would expect it to have more wit or complexity but it doesn't.  If you are looking for a live action version of Cinderella you're much better off going for the 1998 Drew Barrymore version Ever After.",1427500800,7,851,4.6092715231788075
6707871,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I remember when I saw the first advertisement of this film. It was a simple picture of a glass slipper and the word ""March"". My initial reaction? ""Oh God No!!!!!!"" If there was ever a concept that seemed like a cash-in, idiotic milking of a popular iconic piece of pop-culture, this was it. After the (to me anyway) horrific retelling of Sleeping Beauty that was Maleficent, I was all set to be hit by another brainless, fractured version of a classic. There could really only be two possible outcomes in my mind. Either a darker and edgier monstrosity, or a tooth-decay inducing vapid retelling for the kiddies. Later on I was informed that the magnificent Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth; Blue Jasmine) would play the evil stepmother. Whoa. Then I found out Kenneth Branagh was directing. The man behind the greatest (in my opinion) version of Hamlet? To say nothing of the wonderfully fun and entertaining Thor? That could be good OR bad. His old style of film-making tended to overdramatize and overact a bit (as Shakespeare is want to do), but he also has a strong grasp of actual film-making techniques that has led to some truly magnificent cinematography (Hamlet fried my brain with a close-up shot that ended in a long-shot in through a continuous pulling away during a soliloquy, and the court scene with the flower petals falling is iconic). Could it be that this would actually be a decent film after all? I was surprised when my wife wanted to see this film, but after sitting through Maleficent for her and seeing a trailer, I knew that I could get through the film if it was terrible, and enjoy it for what it is if it proved mediocre. I needn't have worried.

The Cinderella Legend

In my late teens and early twenties I have been subjected and educated by every version of Cinderella under the sun. I've seen the Disney animated version. I've seen the Lesley Ann Warren/Rogers and Hammerstein version, the Disney made-for-TV remake with Whoopi Goldberg, Brandy, Bernadette Peters and Whitney Houston, Ever After (with Agelica Huston and Crew Barrymore), the Slipper and the Rose (with music by the Sherman brothers and starring Richard Chamberlain). The Glass Slipper (with Leslie Caron), the 2000 made-for-tv-movie starring Kathleen Turner and David Warner (a favorite of mine), the hilarious and heartbreaking Jerry Lewis film Cinderfella, and yes, all the direct-to-video Disney sequels to the animated original and all the various TV show episodes of the story. My point? By now I ought to be completely sick of this story. And yet...I'm not.

The Cinderella Legend has elements in it that appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds. The belief that if you are a good person, and have a good heart, in the end you will attain what you most desire. Now, this being the oh-so-modern-and-cynical-world, people have criticized the core of this idea to the ground. What makes ONE person more special than any other? It's not good to teach kids that someone will magically hand them the solution to their problems. People need to stand up for themselves and make their own destiny. Princess or prince, people should not be objectified as a mere prize to be won when all obstacles are overcome. And it's not good to encourage people to believe they will live happily ever after when they marry a good looking person they barely know. Well...

The Film

I love this film, but not for the typical reasons. I love great cinematography. I love great film-making. I love use of color and light and correct framing of shots. I love the history of Disney when they used to create films that had a lot of heart. This film is a loving tribute and reconstruction of everything that made Disney the legend that it is. The beginning of the film has scenes that made me think of Disney films from the 60's. There is film grain, and a sunlit hue to many of scenes reminiscent of those classic family films you may have grown up with (like Pollyanna, In Search of the Castaways, and all World of Disney films you loved). At the start, I found this charming, but everything else a smidge forced (perhaps because the modern world is so incredibly dark in comparison). Just the same, as the film took it's time unfolding the backstory, there was a sincerity that came through to me and I found it touching, even if the acting was not quite strong enough to make my accept a few scenes entirely. Then, after a flash-forward the story proper begins, the charm of this film, and the skill with which it was made, drew me in completely.

Cate Blanchett is PERFECT as the evil stepmother, bringing wit, craftiness, smoothness, sharpness, and yet, deliciously hamming it up when appropriate. How do you portray a character who is at once a monster, yet not a caricature or so pure evil as to fracture your sense of belief? She nails it. You love her, you hate her, you feel sorry for her, you admire her, and you WANT Cinderella to defeat her not through nasty tricks but through the one thing her stepmother lacks, a goodness that comes from within.

The two step-sisters are likewise perfect. They are nasty, but mostly due to shallow stupidity rather than outright evil. They are simply two idiots spoiled to the point of rottenness, and it is very entertaining to watch.

The interaction with the animals was something I was prepared to hate, but the gentle cartoonish cgi critters are so darn cute and lovable that you kind of can't help but love their gibberish talk and cuteness (I can't believe I""m saying that). Truly, I can't see any way that such a strong element from the animated original could have been integrated without either reducing it to non-talking animals only there as a nod, or outright talking animals which would have ruined the type of world that was created. For what's it's worth, I love the gentle reminder the mice provide that it IS a world where a LITTLE bit of magic exists. It makes the magical resolution at the end less jarring.

The prince and his advisers are the most realistic, fully-fleshed-out versions I have ever seen in any version of this story. Instead of a cardboard cutout, a youth rebelling against authority, or someone taking pity on someone of the lower class, he has depth and understanding both of his situation and of the gravity of the decisions he is making. The interactions with his father in particular add great dramatic weight to everything else.

And yes, the quirky Fairy Godmother played by Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic. She's the old woman you pass on the road who turns out to be an enchantress. The crazy relative you has magic up her sleeve. And stay past the end credits and you'll even hear her sing!

The CGI in this film is beautifully done, if a bit over-the-top and over-long in spots. In general, the tone of it is right, enhancing outdoor shots and scenery to make everything more cinematic and gorgeous. It also adds some wonderful comedy elements to the transformation of the animals into Cinderella's ride to the ball. Speaking of which...

I had never heard of Lily James before this film, and from the trailers etc I was expecting another vapid blonde Disney Princess. I was genuinely surprised by the heart and depth she brings to her character. She is lovely yes, but more importantly she brings warmth and sincerity to her character that makes you like her, sympathize with her, and root for her as her story unfolds.

The Difference Between Good and Great

Enchanted was a turning point for Disney. They realized that if everyone else was going to laugh at the old Disney tropes then they need to laugh at themselves, or at least give those old classic storytelling elements a nod. This film is the culmination of everything Disney has learned since the original Cinderella. This film is thoroughly self-conscious and aware of every cinderella storytelling device from just about every version of the story ever. It's almost as if the writers and director watched every version of Cinderella they could get their hands on and tried to learn from every single one of them. There's literally no plot holes that I could find, no elements that didn't make sense. And there's nods to classic Disney History everywhere, with a crucial plot point hinging on version of the song Lavender Blue (from the old Disney film So Dear to My Heart).

This film is gorgeous. It's wonderfully written (with enough Jane Austin language to make it feel authentic and enough modern that kids wont' get confused), superbly acted, and has a perfect balance of drama, wit, humor, and heart-touching sweetness. The music is great, the characters memorable, and it's just a really, really FUN film.

But more than all that, this is great film. It's genuinely moving, deftly telling a tale of a Cinderella who is not afraid to run away, nor afraid to face her problems and patiently work through them. It features a handsome prince who has heartfelt discussions with his father, royal advisers who scheme behind the prince's back for his own good, and a stepmother who hates Cinderella for being everything that she is not. If you love fairy tale films, this is a must see, must purchase, must own, must view regularly film. It is in my humble opinion, the greatest adaptation of this story yet, and that's high praise indeed coming from me. It will make your heart soar, and might, just might, make you believe in magic again.",1427500800,14,9379,4.7483118477593615
6707872,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Kenneth Branagh is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. Best known for his naturalistic Shakespeare adaptations, he gives this lovely adaptation of CINDERELLA a thoughtful and whimsical touch. The film is a live-action extension of the 1950 animated classic, but does away with the bloat (e.g., the excessive focus on the mice) and soullessness (of the characters).

The success of this film rests on the art design and casting. The scene where mice, lizards, pumpkin, and girl are transformed into horses, footmen, carriage, and princess is just sensational. Lily James as Ella is sweet without being cloying. In a role that can be forgettable for its similarity to other demure princesses, James is a strong presence and holds her own against Cate Blanchett's Stepmother. Blanchett is divine as ever and shows why she is electric on film. The beginning of this film is pleasant but prosaic until she enters, her eyes glittering behind a lace veil, and an edge of wickedness to her bold red-tinged smile. She's decked to perfection in 1940s-inspired fashion that contrasts wonderfully with Ella's country gowns. With that said, Branagh does not rest on make them opposites. They are two women at different points in their lives, both having suffered great loss, and both having made different life choices.

Even the Prince has his own arc in the film. Richard Madden was well-cast in this role for both his likability and physical presence (in the viewing I attended, both men and women audibly commented on his bluest-of-blue eyes and smile). He's gallant and charming, of course, but he is also an heir to a throne who wishes wholeheartedly to be a good son and become a good king.

And that is the heart of the film. More than a love story or fairy tale, the message of Cinderella is about keeping heart in the face of life's joys and trials. As Ella's mother imparts to her in their final conversation: Have courage. Be kind. It's a wonderful message for children and adults, alike.",1427500800,4,1998,4.905325443786983
6707873,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Brilliant re-telling of the Cinderella story without undue pressure to make the animated version live. This film is its own piece of art and it radiates it. I think the title role player holds jer own and works to best advantage when she plays out the part in a repertoire manner. That being done, Cate Blanchette prances in front of us with plenty of evil to dispense. She has a fabulous way of dipping by people and swooning into situations and bowing in the Chinese fashion, all very effective as are her clothes and her daughters, two bric brac bitches in matching styles with different colors in most scenes, giving them a disturbing look of two incomplete people. Cinderella has her blue dress and later her smashing blue gown, got up by Helena Bohnam carter who is magnificent in her own gown and in her role.
The Prince is charming and his eyes match Cinderlla's as well as her gown at the ball. he is ardent and very moving in a scene with his father, the King.

The colors, the special effects, the clothes, the acting, yes we have actors for once and gthey are magical.

See it and feel the energy.

One thing: The 1950 Cinderella songs, two of them, are sung at the end credits by James and Carter..they could have used those two songs easily in the film..still great.

Ah, the camera work..not to be forgotten..brilliant. An award is coming for that.",1427414400,3,1363,4.551020408163265
6707874,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I could just swoon. *Big grin* This movie brought on all the fluttery feelings and happy sighs that a really good fairytale romance does!

  It was just a good, old-fashioned Cinderella tale through and through. I was delighted with how true the movie producers stayed to the classic fairytale! From the cool, horrid stepmother, to the tittering, outlandish stepsisters, to Ellas own sweet self; this movie was like watching the animated version come to life in a much more beautiful, bright, emotional version! I enjoy varied adaptions of fairytales... but following the original is just the best! So happy! Cinderella (2015) is classic yet its own. Stunning.

  Lily James (whom I first met as Lady Rose in Downton Abbey (2010) *smiles*), played Cinderella. She did a lovely job! I have to mention again how sweet, gentle, and good this character was! Also spirited, passionate, and full of life! I so appreciate when the leading lady characters have such a lovely, tender demeanor paired with a striking inner strength! Loved this version of Ella! Beautiful inside and out!

  The wicked stepmother was played by Cate Blanchett. Im used of seeing Cate as an ethereal wizardess in white from Lord of the Rings (2001, 2002, 2003) and The Hobbit (2012, 2013, 2014)! But she did an amazing job as the cold stepmother in this fairytale. Appearing quite different with insensitive laughter, extravagant gowns and hats, and a sorrowful past. She's by far the best of Cinderella's stepmother that I've seen/read about. There was a depth to her character beyond just heedless cruelty.

  Sophie McShera (also from Downton Abbey (2010), as a maid) and Holliday Grainger portrayed Drisella and Anastasia quite perfectly. I had to laugh time and again, even though they were so spoiled and snobbish! The horrible singing. The flamboyant outfits. The overeager attitudes. *Shakes heads* Very true to the original animated version of Cinderella! And yet it wasn't overdone at all.

  Oh, and just a quick mention of the Prince (Richard Madden) and the Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter). Both characters were lovely! The fairy godmother eccentric, funny, and sweet. The Prince what a wonderful young man, *smiles*!! Hes such a thoughtful, charming, gentle person. A perfect match for Cinderella!

  The colors, the gowns, the detail I could go on and on! It was all so exquisite and beautiful!! Cinderellas blue ball-gown has to be one of the loveliest dresses I have ever seen! The way it rippled and sparkled when she ran. The way it flounced and flew as she danced. And those shoes!! Even the stepmother and her daughters outfits are enough to be gushed over. The costumes of Cinderella (2015) were just perfectly glamorous. You have to watch it for yourself to feel the affect!

  So much emotion too! Absolutely enthralling to watch familiar scenes from the animated movie come about with so much feeling and detail. Ah! *Sighs and smiles*! It was so lovely. And poignant. There were little moments and things added that gave moving profoundness. You simply must watch this grand new version of our beloved fairytale, Cinderella. You can never get enough of that rags to riches story for the mistreated serving girl. Of a considerate young prince who falls in love with a lowly, sweet-hearted maiden. Believe me, its swoon-worthy! *smiles* Every woman loves a good fairytale deep down inside, right?

  Cinderella (2015) is true to its PG rating. The only downer would be the low-cut gowns worn by Ella and her stepmother and stepsisters. Otherwise, theres dancing where a man puts his hand on the womans waist; several scenes of slipping a shoe on a womans foot; and a sweet kiss. Two girls also dance around in their corsets and hoopskirts, snickering.

  Otherwise, I cant say enough good things. A classic fairytale. A poignant story. An ardent romance. Gorgeous film. I loved it.

  I could go on about so many other things that I liked and scenes I adored... But you really just need to experience it for yourself! I won't give anymore away",1427328000,9,4044,4.965824665676077

Disney raids its back catalogue to give one of its most iconic tales a coat of live-action paint.

What did I think?

Director Kenneth Branaghs take on Cinderella doesnt stray too far from the source material, but plumps the story up enough to be interesting. Its a beautiful chocolate box of a film that gives its familiar characters a bit more depth (but manages to resist the urge to update by simply cutting-and-pasting modern sass onto fairy tale staples). Helena Bonham-Carters fairy godmother is a delight, but Cate Blanchetts wicked stepmother steals the show. Oh, and the Prince (Game of Thrones Richard Madden) wears some very, very tight breeches which can only be described as awkward.

6707877,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Finding your soulmate is one of life's ultimate pleasures. Nothing, but nothing is more important than the profound love between two people. Of course you will have differences. Your class background may not be equal - but in end that does not matter. What matters is that you are true to yourself  and each other. Here are some other good messages: There is a spiritual world that will help you in your hour of need if you let it! A king can be good ruler and everyone can prosper from wise leadership. (There are certainly plenty working class people in this version of Cinderella, but no one is in rags or going hungry in this well run little kingdom.) Forgiveness protects you from bitterness, hatred and the need for revenge. Be kind to strangers. They might be angels in disguise. You can be a decent person without letting people walk all over you. Being good natured is not a weakness, but a strength. Speak truth to power. Exploiting people will backfire in the end. Strength comes from within. The ends don't justify the means. Surround yourself with true friends. Be kind to animals. They are also your friends. Face adversity with courage. True beauty is within you! Accept your child for who they are. Be honest with those you love.

I could go on and on! There are so many good messages in this version of Cinderella you could actually make a contest out of it!

Isn't it amazing that Hollywood can tell a story with zero physical violence and without going overboard on being too campy or boring? Here's a fairytale where you actually care about the characters!

Acting was ok. The principals did well but At times some smaller characters look they they are trying too hard and fake (The man who breaks the sad news to Cinderella is the first to go in that category)  But everyone is playing this as a fairytale so I guess it's hard to fault them for being over the top.  I thought the star of the movie was the evil step mother (Cate Blanchett), she was the most impressive.  I did enjoy Helena Bonham Carter for the brief moment she gets as the fairy godmother.

Overall,  just ok.  Nice work with the sets and colors. The movie adds a little more backstory to Cinderella's childhood and parents but to my dismay stuck to the old cartoon nearly scene for scene.  I was hoping it would be a little different or add in a twist to modernize it.  However, I saw it with a child who loved it.  So, I guess the bottom line is, if you love classic Disney or you have a child who loves the princess fairy tales this is a great movie.

This version adds a beginning, with (Cinder) Ella as a child, brought up by two very loving parents.  Years after her mom takes sick and dies, dad decides to remarry.  While away on a business trip, he becomes ill and dies.  You know the rest of the story.

Cate Blanchett does a great job as the mean step mother.  Cinderella has a sincere sweetness about her and the Prince is very handsome.  They hit it off from the first minute they meet, so you feel really good when boy gets girl and girl gets boy.  The elements of love and goodness embedded in the film are very refreshing and I loved Cinderella's departing words to her stepmother.  Go see it and buy the CD.

6707883,4,B00O2IZPD8,"Disney saw fit to precede Kenneth Branagh's live-action retelling of Cinderella with a short film ""sequel' to their animated hit, Frozen. It's a union that works perfectly in just about every way because Cinderella, like Frozen, isn't really looking to reinvent the wheel. It's there telling a sweet and inspiring princess story full of charming princes, evil stepmothers, and magical powers. For once, Disney has decided to forego reimaginings and unnecessary attempts to soften iconic characters (hello Maleficent) and stuck with elegant, well-told simplicity, and the approach fits like a glass slipper.

Steeped in a dazzling array of confectionary colors and sparkling magical whimsy that compares beautifully to the 1950 animated classic, Cinderella makes a strong case to be first in our thoughts. While screenwriter Chris Weitz largely sticks to the story beats we've all known since childhood, the few changes he does make actually streamline and improve the tale in small but noticeable ways. It begins with an opening sequence setting up the loving relationship between young Ella and her sweet and caring parents (an unrecognizable Hayley Atwell and Ben Chaplin) who instill in her a kindness that can move mountains. ""Have courage and be kind"" her mother tells her early and often, becoming a mantra that sticks with the girl even as tragedy strikes.

It all threatens to become a little too sweet until the arrival of Cate Blanchett, dripping with venom and faux gracefulness as Lady Tremaine, Ella's new stepmother when her birth mother dies suddenly. Sporting a variety of garish, hideous, and totally evil costumes (one actually looks like something Loki would wear); Tremaine is a total cooz right from the start. Along with her equally nasty daughters, Anastasia and Drizella (Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera), they may Ella's life a living Hell, especially when her father also perishes while away on business. From there the film plays out by the book, with Ella's kindness being twisted and used against her. Rather quickly she becomes the maid of the house because certainly Tremaine and her daughters can't be bothered with such a thing. But their treatment of her is as something less than human, and certainly not like part of the family.

While we do learn more about what motivates Tremaine to be so ugly, she never becomes a character we want to sympathize with. In fact, we may hate her more after learning what her deal really is. Blanchett, beautiful and fearsome in shimmering satin, gives the character more humanity than she deserves, and that she's able to accomplish it basically in two scenes speaks volumes. In her we see a mother's fear for her children's future and a jealousy towards the youthful. ""She too had known grief, but she wore it wonderfully well"", we're told by the exuberant narrator, who turns out to be Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother. She bounces around delightfully in only one extended scene, but a film like this wouldn't feel right without Carter being in it somewhere. She fits the role perfectly as a counterpoint to Blanchett's ugliness.

Blanchett pretty much steals the film like any true villainess should, but she doesn't completely overshadow James' endearing performance as Cinderella. Innocence and warmth come off her in waves, but also a true sense of wonder when magical forces begin working in her favor. Effectively charming as Prince Charming is Game of Thrones' Richard Madden, who seems designed for exactly this kind of role with his big blue eyes and wide, toothy smile. Although it's tough to get past how unexciting his character is when compared to Chris Pine's conceited Prince in Into the Woods. Speaking of which, those looking for a bevy of musical numbers will be disappointed, although I was more than happy at the lack of them. Too many songs can be stifling and Cinderella has a nice flow that doesn't need to be broken up.

The Cinderella story is, let's face it, a little bit silly when one actually stops and thinks about it. A glass slipper that only one girl can fit? To Weitz's credit he embraces many of the less believable aspects and has fun with them without parody or irony. He even holds on to what can be considered Cinderella's less-than-progressive message, which doesn't inspire women to be more than just some rich guy's wife. It's a fairy tale in just about every way imaginable. Be as pretty on the inside as on the outside and you'll get yourself a prince. It would have been nice to see Cinderella take a more active role in her happiness, but that's not really part of her story.

Branagh has had a rough couple of years as a director lately. His Thor was arguably Marvel's weakest film, and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit was the blandest action movie of the last couple of years. He's fared better with Shakespearean efforts, but Cinderella is the first time he's indulged us with colorful, dazzling eye candy. This is the best-looking film Branagh has ever done, and he seems inspired by the freedom of a world this fantastical to play around in. Not all of the CGI quite lives up to his imagination, however. Cinderella's little rodent friends are more annoying than anything, and the visual effects during the pumpkin carriage scene are...well, a total pumpkin.

Disney may have a new generation of fairy tale princesses with Tangled, Frozen, and even Pixar's Brave, but Cinderella proves that the classics still have a story worth telling.",1426809600,8,5471,4.966157205240175
6707884,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Here I thought that doing the 1950 Disney cartoon Cinderella all over might have been a mistake.  This movie has it all: pacing, excellent acting on all hands, and enough restraint to not make the characters over the top.  Lily James as Cinderella is pure magic to watch.  She is sweet and kind but not cloyingly so.  She remonstrates only once with her stepmother, and then in a reasonable way, and throughout the movie to the end demonstrates her mother's loving admonition to always have courage and to be kind.

Cate Blanchett as the stepmother plays the role perfectly.  She's mean and overly protective of her daughters, but when confronted by Cinderella for her abuses she spills part of her own history.  She's been widowed twice, and remarks to Cinderella that she herself was once young and beautiful like Cinderella but now...she never finishes the sentence.  Her regret at her own losses and her jealousy of her stepdaughter come out.

The rest of the characters are perfectly fleshed out, with Helena Bonham Carter as the rather error-prone fairy godmother a real treat.  The special effects are both well done and amusing, the settings lush--especially the costumes and ballroom--and the developing relationship between prince and Cinderella is expertly handled by director Kenneth Branagh.  The ballroom dance was a real pleasure to watch.

I'd heard good things about this movie, but they weren't laudatory enough.  The story of Cinderella is as old as time, but the satisfaction of seeing good triumph and a happy ending never pales.  This version of Cinderella sets the standard.",1426723200,3,1597,5.0458015267175576
6707885,5,B00O2IZPD8,Everything I wanted it to be!  I loved this story as a little girl and was so happy to be able to take my own 9 year old daughter.  I thought it was done amazingly!  The actors were all perfect for their parts.  Lily James could not have captured the innocence and beauty of Cinderella any better!  The only thing I did not care for was the lizard footman.  He almost looked scary!  Very creepy looking.  Such a positive message too for little girls about kindness and courage.  So nice to see a movie that is still classic and just plain old fun!,1426723200,2,547,4.233009708737864
6707886,5,B00O2IZPD8,I took myself and my 3 year old daughter to watch this movie on 3/15/15. I was skeptical because of my recent watch of maleficent. I really watched it to monitor it for my children.  Only to discover it wad dark. So movie begins and wow just everything fell into place and it was breath taking.  The beauty of the settings the characters wow!. All I gotta say even though I had to get up multiple times for bathroom breaks it was a well written script.  The ONLY flaw I had was how tiny Ellas dress was in the waste.,1426550400,,516,4.14
6707887,5,B00O2IZPD8,"Over the past couple of years, Disney has done A LOT of good in terms of movies. They make great animated movies, fun and exciting live-action movies, more importantly, they make movies for EVERYONE to enjoy. And Ladies and gentlemen, they have once again done just that with the movie Cinderella.

Unlike the beloved Disney animated classic, this movie shows Ella from her time as a baby and her time as a child. Ella lives in a enormous house with her father and her mother. Later on, tragedy hits Ella and her father unexpectedly as Ella's mother comes down with a fatal illness. After Ella's mother makes Ella promise to have both courage and kindness, the movie fast-forwards to Ella's teenage years; only to reveal that a new wife has been chosen for Ella's father. Ella's stepmother has two daughters of her own, and a cat-a cat named Lucifer.

Lily James portrays Ella/Cinderella wonderfully in the movie. She plays an innocent, kind-natured girl who lives in the most unfortunate of circumstances A.K.A. her evil stepmother and crazy step-sisters. Richard Madden stars as Prince Kit and does a marvelous job, he definitely has the ideal look for the prince in the movie, and I like the chemistry between he and James. Helena Bonham Carter does an exceptionally splendid job playing the Fairy Godmother, and Cate Blanchett nearly steals the show as Lady Tremaine (Evil Stepmother). Hayley Atwell stars as Ella's mother and does a fabulous job, while actors Nonso Anozie and Stellan Skarsgard do well in their supporting roles as the Captain and the Grand Duke respectively. If there is one of the many things that I will say about Cinderella, its that each actor/actress fit his/her role extremely well.

What else did I like in Cinderella? From a visual standpoint, Cinderella is nothing short of impressive. Equally impressive is the set/costume design. In terms of story, Cinderella does do a FEW things differently but this movie keeps all the magical charm of the beloved original, and has a very positive message to go along with it. Cinderella is a highly enjoyable film due to the acting, the direction, and because it stays true to the film we all know and love; while adding a valuable theme to the movie.

I Enjoyed this film a great deal. If you are a fan of the 1950 Disney animated movie, a fan of Disney movies, a fan of Cinderella, or like myself, a fan of movies period, then I tell you this: GO SEE Cinderella because Cinderella is

A Great Experience

 If u liked the disney animated versions U WILL ADORE THIS LIVE ACTION VERSION which follow the original events with a great continuity.
 Lily james is almost perfect as cinderella and i can only think of 1 other actress to fit more to the role.
 KIMBERY MATULA
 Since kimberly was not given the role then lily was the perfect choice.
 The movie is innocent, touchy has a great soundtrack and is all u need to remember your innocent childhood days and escape from reality.
 So far the best movie of the year.

 PS.

 Dumbo and beauty and the beast were announced as follow up live action disney films....",1426550400,,738,4.607692307692307
6707889,4,B00O2IZPD8,"""Once upon a time..."" These irresistible words launch the latest re-working of a beloved fairy tale (there have been scores of versions). Even though this one is capably directed by Richard Branagh (""Thor""), I will yield to temptation and mention some of my personal favorites.

We have:
  * Lily James (""Downton Abbey"") is our eponymous heroine, a forced laborer stuck with household tasks when her father dies and leaves her at the mercy of his widow. (I like Drew Barry- more's version in ""Ever After"" because she conks the prince on the head with an apple when she thinks he's a thief.)
  * Helena Bonham Carter (""Les Misrables"") hits all her marks as Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, although she sees to her OWN needs first. (My favorite is the kleptomaniac from ""The Glass Slipper."" THAT beautiful ball gown was pilfered from someone's clothesline!)
  * Richard Madden (""Game of Thrones"") meets Cinderella in the forest and our charming prince is reluctant to admit to this sweet maiden who he really is. (Nothing against this young man, but did you SEE Chris Pine in ""Into the Woods?"")
  * Derek Jacobi (""Last Tango in Halifax"") is The King, not long for this world, but he wants his son safely married and the future of his kingdom insured before he goes.
  * Cate Blanchett (""Blue Jasmine"") is the evil stepmother. She actually out-evils a self-centered Jane Lynch in ""Another Cinderella Story.""
  * Stellan Skarsgrd (""Hector and the Search for Happiness"") The Duke has to be sure the prince will marry a princess, not a commoner!
  * Ben Chaplin (""World Without End"") along with Hailey Atwell (""Agent Carter"") are our poor orphan's parents, too soon gone. But they taught her to ""be kind and have courage.""
  * Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera have the thankless task of portraying the one-dimensional stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella.

Clearly the basic story is unchanged but the costumes are spectacular (particularly Cinderella's blue ball gown), and the CGI mice are darling (there is even a Gus Gus). This is rated PG, but I must mention that the headlong dash for home before that last stroke of midnight becomes pretty stressful.

There were numerous wannabe princesses in the theater, complete with blue dresses and bejeweled tiaras. I thought the five year olds were cute, but the 15 year olds looked pathetic!",1426464000,,2335,4.956298200514139
6707890,5,B00O2IZPD8,"I was able to convince my dear husband to accompany me on a date to see this new film. Being a cynic he held the notion this was just another Disney kiddie's film.  We booked tickets for today's Monday 1.50pm screening and once seated, noticed we were surrounded mostly by parents and their young children. As the large cinema hall seats started filling up, I thought our enjoyment would surely be disrupted by noisy unruly kids. Instead, we were in for a cinematic treat.

The new Cinderella film is visually stunning. I teared up a few times as my heart  swelled with emotion during certain touching scenes, the acting really was that sincere. This audience's attention was captured by the gorgeous imagery of colorful costumes, soaring music, and an enchanting story with a happy ending. A tapestry of action, glitter and magic.

The young (and old) audience sat silent and spellbound.

The film stars two most charming protagonists..a winsome Cinderella (Lily James) and her charming and handsome prince (Richard Madden).

A most charming and beautifully rendered film that will make your heart swell with hope and romance. Well recommended, if you can do so, go see it on the largest cinema screen.",1426464000,4,1203,4.930693069306931
