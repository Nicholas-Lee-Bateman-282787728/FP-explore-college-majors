5008752,5,B006O94DJK,"it is indeed hella. so hella, in fact, that it outperforms the old definition of hella and the word hella has forever become associated with gundam uc. look it up. right there in the dictionary. you see the word hella? bam. gundam unicorn",1377993600,,238,4.558139534883721
5008753,5,B006O94DJK,"If you want my Product feature review check part 1 of the Gundam UC set. In this im just adding that the story is  great, awesome fights and some extras, 5/5 again. support Gundam by buying these.",1377734400,,196,4.297297297297297
5008754,5,B006O94DJK,"If you are a fan of the gundam universe,  gundam unicorn is a great series to have in your collection.",1366848000,,102,4.1
5008755,5,B006O94DJK,"This show is just great. It is well written with great animation on level with any theatrically released anime film and a score that is just simply amazing. On top of that the series, when completed, will complete the original story of Gundam, as a direct sequel to Gundam masterworks Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and the less known ZZ Gundam along with the film Char's Counterattack. A must for any fan of the Universal Century Timeline.",1347494400,,442,4.753246753246753
5008756,5,B006O94DJK,The animation and the story is very good. I am already a Gundam follower this is one i must continue.,1346803200,,101,4.1
5008757,5,B006O94DJK,"The dvd is worth it in every way. myself being a very oldschool gundam fan it makes me happy to see the ending of the great UC.
Episode four has one of what i call the greatest battles ive seen. the only downside is this and the double,00 sets are the finale gundam dvd sets the us shall ever receive. bandai left with a bang to me. code geass, oo , and this are worth every penny if your hardcore gundam or Anime fan. The extras are also outstanding great music score and outsanding story leave this as one of the best and yet most incomplete of the gundam UC Saga.",1328659200,10,566,4.108108108108108
5008758,1,B006O94DJK,"Cover art matches the Gundam UC Blu Ray number 3.  From the back cover, the same special features apply except for BluRay Live.  If you don't have a blu-ray player, this version will suffice",1328659200,,190,4.5588235294117645
8501667,5,B006O94DJK,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was so excited because he didn't think that you could ever get the Unicorn series in the US. Thank you Amazon!,1517529600,,160,4.193548387096774

8501669,5,B006O94DJK,"The second DVD release and the final Gundam release before Bandai's demise, this single disc covers episode 3: The Ghost of Laplace and episode 4: At the Bottom of the Gravity Well. The animation is again top notch with these episodes paying a particular nod to the old Mobile Suits from many past UC series.

The cover is reversible again and the set is really great for a budget set and at $20, it's a lot better than paying $120 for these two episodes on Bluray.",1464825600,,465,4.406976744186046
8501670,4,B006O94DJK,Four star because it was least damage cover. It careful! I'm not mad. I just fixed it thnx.,1461801600,,91,4.111111111111111
8501671,3,B006O94DJK,"This review is written for all 4 volumes of Gundam UC, since I ordered them all together. I've been meaning to get the series since last year with the final release, but wasn't going to pay almost $200. I got them on DVD as well to fit the rest of the collection (all of which are DVD as well).

I absolutely LOVE Mobile Suit Gundam UC. It's one of the best two Universal Century series out of them all, with the other being 0083 Stardust Memory. The animation & soundtrack are well beyond expectation, I only wish they would redo the other UC era series with the current-age tech to give them the same level of graphical beauty as Gundam Unicorn (Not to mention it would FINALLY give ZZ Gundam & Victory Gundam a dubbed release).

HOWEVER, the reason that I rated them at only 3 Stars out of 5...

2 Day Shipping.

When I get 2 DAY shipping, I expect the order to arrive 2 days later, not 4 days Amazon...

My order was placed on Saturday, July 18th with a GUARANTEED arrival of Monday, July 20th. Yet, when I access the tracking later on it says that the guaranteed arrival is now Wednesday, July 22nd. My question; Why?

Overall, I'm well beyond satisfied with the product. It's just the delay in shipping that bugs me a bit. However it's the first issue I've had with Amazon, so I'll let it slide.",1437523200,,1301,4.333333333333333
8501672,5,B006O94DJK,Amazing! Unicorn is amazing and the animation is top notch! It's probably as good as 8th Ms Team and the Original Mobile Suit.,1430265600,,126,4.521739130434782
