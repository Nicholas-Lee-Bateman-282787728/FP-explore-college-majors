8518500,5,B007JVJ3EM,"Ernie Hawkins is both a master guitar player and teacher, who studied under Rev. Gary Davis in his youth and who has passed on his tremendous knowledge to countless others. Anybody would would like to see how carefully he breaks down each song, phrase by phrase, can see samples of this recording and his other instructional DVDs on Stefan Grossman's website. His C-A-G-E-D system of learning different voicing of the open chords enables the beginning guitarist to play ""up the neck,"" and not remain stuck in the first position.

Here, Ernie explores the wonderful finger-picking style of Big Bill Broonzy, who was another great player in the ""Piedmont Blues"" style shared by Rev. Gary Davis, Elizabeth Cotten, Mississippi John Hurt (even though he lived in Mississippi) and others. The choice of songs represents the different facets of the style and really opens everything up. Thanks, Ernie!",1384041600,4,894,5.123287671232877
8518501,3,B007JVJ3EM,"Let me start out by saying that Ernie Hawkins is probably a good guitar player, but his instruction borders between horrendous and non-existent. He'll zip right through most parts of any given song without explaining what he's doing, then he will just stop playing and start talking about a something totally off subject. There were many points throughout these DVDs where I actually questioned if I was using the same tabs that he was.  For best results, put these DVDs in your computer to print out the tabs and learn it on your own.....this guy will only confuse and frustrate you.

This DVD was worth the money merely for the tabs and videos of Big Bill.",1358553600,,658,4.663793103448276
