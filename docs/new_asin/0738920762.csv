2936,5,0738920762,"I originally started with the Baby Bach and Mozart tapes for my baby boy, who is now 11 months (at about 4 months)but I could see he was getting bored with the Baby Einstein set.  I noticed he liked Sesame Street, so I purchased the ""123 Count with Me"", video - Well he is addicted!  He laughs along with Ernie and friends.  He also get's a real big kick out of the bellhop-rat!  It was by no choice of our own that my husband and I now know all the songs and can occasionally be found singing them at work and in other embarrassing public places.  I really think a child couldn't help to memorize 1-20 just by knowing the opening and closing songs.  I would just like to WARN you... no more ""News at 6"" or ""HBO"" once this video becomes a favorite!",972432000,20,748,4.159722222222222
2937,5,0738920762,"When Ernie drops by ""The Furry Arms"" hotel to return a missing key he found, he ends up giving everyone a lesson in counting, and also ends up getting hired as hotel manager! Ernie soon discovers that when he ""Dings The Dinger"", Benny The Bunny (Kevin Clash-who also does Elmo) will bring him something different everytime, depending on the number of times he dings. For example, when Ernie dings 3 times, Benny brings 3 pillows. Ernie however, does not need the pillows, and tells Benny he's glad he now knows what happens when he dings 3 times. This running gag goes during the entire video, and it gets quite funny. Most of the segments in this video are well chosen, such as a neat segment with singing crows, and the fantastic ""Honk Around The Clock""! I also find the new songs very catchy, and have found myself sing them quite often! This not only gets five stars becalse it's much better then ""The Great Numbers Game"", but also becalse it's extremely funny! In recent years, The Furry Arms seems to have been deleted from the show. Why? It was such a great place, and I liked Natasha's parents having a job! Oh, well. At least we have this video!",970704000,30,1154,4.526315789473684
2938,4,0738920762,"Like many parents, I purchased this with the belief that it would be far better than other programs, and also serve as a good educational vehicle -  and we were not disappointed.  Our daughter adores the characters, and her  comprehension for counting continues to grow.  The difference between  Barney stuff (entertainment) vs. Sesame street (edu-tainment) is amazing.
As an adult, I find myself humming along to the tunes.  Okay, so I  happen to be a big kid.  In any case, your kids will enjoy it, and as a  parent, you will have a guilt free conscience about your kids consuming too  much TV.",969235200,4,596,4.699029126213592
2939,3,0738920762,"I bought this video at the same time as I bought ""Do the Alphabet"" and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for ""Bic Birt"" (Big Bird is on the box of ""Alphabet"").  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked, but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally,  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  ""Alphabet"" tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older.",957830400,,531,4.22

2941,4,0738920762,"My 18 month old has been enjoying this video for months.  It has some old favorites (""#9 cutie"", ""One singular sensation"") and some new catchy tunes (""1 and 2 and 3"" sung by three counting  crows, ""Seven"" sung by Dorothy andher goldfish friends &  ""Five"" rapped by M.C.

2942,5,0738920762,"My 21 month old son has watched this video countless times. It is hands down one of his favorites. This tape spotlights Ernie (one of his favorite Sesame Street characters) and includes Elmo in several segments - always a  plus.  The best part is he's already learned to count to ten. And although  he's watched this many times , I'm not at all sick of it.  The songs are  fun and catchy and in typical Sesame Street fashion, the muppets are clever  and entertaining, even for adults.  I highly recommend this video.",942451200,13,516,4.543478260869565
2943,4,0738920762,This is my 18-month old son Max's favorite video. He dances to the songs  that are a mix of classic skits (that I remember from when I watched Sesame  Street) and modern pop rock spoofs. It's a video that both parents and  children will love.  END,908496000,3,247,4.304347826086956

2990,5,0738920762,My 20 month old loves this film!!! He watches it and even tries to count with them. He knows the names of the characters too. It is a very colorful newer production as opposed to some of the films that have a bright cover but are really films from the early 90s. It does have a few throwback scenes in it which are all good. I would recommend this movie!!!,1404432000,,356,4.1
2991,5,0738920762,My daughter loves this video so much.  We started playing it for her in the car when she was around 1 years old.  She sings along and never gets tired of it.  I even bought it for others as gifts.,1401926400,,196,3.85

2993,5,0738920762,"My daughter likes this video... It isn't her favorite (she prefers Grover), but she enjoys watching it - Other posters complained about the bunny being rude - he IS short tempered, but it's more humorous than offensive (in my opinion)...",1396310400,,237,4.95

3000,5,0738920762,"I got this for my daughter to watch as an educational show rather than letting her watch what I consider more ""junk"" shows.  I don't like her watching too much TV but Grandma will let her watch plenty so it's easier to buy things like this and 'redirect' what she let's my daughter watch.  This is very engaging and educational.  My daughter loves all the sesame street characters.",1387584000,,381,4.573529411764706

3004,3,0738920762,"I love Sesame Street and I like the other DVDs I have purchased so far. This one is not great.

One if the characters is angry and annoyed and in a bad mood through most of the program. His voice gets on my nerves. I don't enjoy listening to it while I am driving and I don't really want my daughter to be influenced by seeing the character's negative behavior.

We rarely play this one.",1380153600,,387,4.1466666666666665
3005,2,0738920762,"I gave this to a friend's daughter who is 27 months old. She's just beginning to watch video as her parents waited until she was two years old before exposing her to videos. She was eager to watch the video, but after five or ten minutes she said, ""I don't like this."" She asked for Elmo. Her mother tried to fast forward to other places in the video, but she soundly rejected it. Instead, she happily watched the Letter factory video I sent her a few weeks ago.

We're still hoping with time and more exposure she might come to like this video. But today I ordered her the Elmo Potty Training video. If she wants Elmo; I'll send her Elmo.

3009,2,0738920762,"My 2 year old daughter enjoys the songs, but the snarky and rude behavior modeled by Ernie and the bellhop is a bad example for her.

3016,5,0738920762,"These DVD are just as pleasurable for the parents as for the tots! My little guy loves this video. The songs are catchy, the Muppets/puppets have great characters - yes even the surly rat bellhop.

Above and beyond the obvious counting lessons to be learned here, there are many many great tactics taught to little ones. They learn how to make work easier by using skills available, how to deal with not so nice people and how to do research!

One thing I didn't know was that Sesame Street is completely non-profit. All proceeds go to help children around the world enjoy the wonderful and proven learning techniques these programs has to offer.

So, now I can buy a DVD that my son loves and get the pleasure of knowing I'm doing good for someone else.",1360368000,,754,4.529411764705882

3019,5,0738920762,"I was at walmart a few months ago and I found this dvd in the $5 bin. Up until then my son had been watching your baby can read. His vocabulary improved from your baby can read however they didn't include a segment on numbers in the first 3 dvd's. I picked this up hoping it would help us introduce him to numbers. I must say I didn't expect him to like it as much as he does. He was only about 15 or 16 months at the time, but he started asking to watch the movie everyday. So, we made it a routine every morning he watches it after breakfast and sometimes before bed. By 18 or 19 months my son was recognizing numbers and pointing them out whenever he saw them. My son is now 22months and he can count to 10 with no problem. I also let my god-daughter watch it, and after a few times she was counting and singing the songs as well. Her parents were desperate for a copy of their own, but couldn't find it at walmart. Amazon has it so I'm going to order a copy for her. I recommend this to any parent who wants to help their child learn their numbers. It really is a great tool and the songs are so catchy that you'll be singing along with your child.",1355097600,,1152,3.9913419913419914
3020,1,0738920762,"It's goofy enough for my son to think it's hilarious, but there is not much educational value to this dvd.  The clips are too random and jumpy- sometimes you are talking about a certain number for 5 seconds and sometimes you will spend 60 seconds on a certain number.  If you are wanting a dvd to help your child learn how to count, buy something else.

Thankfully I got this at a garage sale for $1 - but it wasn't even worth that.  Oh well.",1347494400,,442,4.1647058823529415

We incorporate counting and saying our alphabet letters throughout the day daily. Yesterday I parked in spot #21 which was very clearly labeled and she keeped saying ""12, 12, 12..."" I realized that we needed to advance her to learning more numbers b/c to her it looked like a 12 since she could only count to 15.

This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.
We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.

The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers.  We all sing along and, quite frankly, I can't get the songs for the numbers 3, 5, and 10 out of my head.

Once there, he engages in some banter with Benny the Bunny, the hotel owner and some hotel staff. This goes on for several minutes and becomes tedious before some short Sesame Street segments are able to offer a brief respite. Some of these are good, though the song with three blackbirds is not very good and lasts too long. Also, the MC Elmo song about the Number Five is also on The Best of Elmo DVD; so, if you are looking for exclusive Elmo material for your child, this is not your best bet. Now, I like Ernie as much as the next person, but I'm not certain what they were thinking when they decided to feature so much interaction with other, practically unknown characters. He ends up dinging the bellhop bell fifteen times, which is way too repetitious for even the youngest viewer.

The bunny is extremly rude to Ernie and the Honker, and Ernie and the Honker repeatedly bother and annoy Benny, even after Benny asks them to stop (and of course, asks in a rude way).  The educational value is minimal.  I really don't think this helped my child to count to 15 or to recognize his numbers.

* The song segments, many of which are based on adult songs ranging from ""One"" (A Chorus Line) to ""Rock Around the Clock,"" are well-produced and very funny.

* There's a plot, but it's mainly a device to tie the song segments together and to throw in as many sight gags as possible along the way.  Perfect for the attention span of a very young child.

* Plenty of yuks for the adults in true Sesame Street style.  The hotel owner is Ms. Sherry Netherland...the Furry Arms has a half-star restaurant featuring Peanut Butter Goulash as the daily special...if you watch carefully, there are a few subplots involving only characters that appear in the background.  Sesame Street assumes that people of all ages will be watching; it's a rare producer for young viewers that does this.

Our daughter has watched this video for only a few weeks and already counts aloud more easily than she did before ""Count with Me.""  It's the only video we own that we'll gladly sit down and watch with her.  Thumbs up!",1135814400,,1137,4.64

For the sake of comparison, I do not hold Sesame Street's Do the Alphabet video (hosted by Big Bird) in high regard. In 1, 2, 3 Count With Me the story cleverly centers around work at the Furry Arms Hotel and with great comic relief shows children practical applications for using numbers. I bought the video when my son was two years old. My children, currently ages 4 1/2 and 2, learned number recognition and numeric order reliably thanks to the catchy theme song and clips highlighting specific numbers. Now that my oldest child is successfully learning addition, I see in a new light the importance of reinforcing numerical order (adults take it for granted). Educational value aside, this video makes them laugh out loud too.",1130630400,10,822,4.675862068965517

My 12-month-old niece is into cartoon in the first place. My sister-in-law's mistake. Cartoon offers her entertainment. And my wife told her younger sister that Sesame Street DVD can be a good tool for babies/kids to learn & promised her it'll be a birthday gift for her daughter. Sadly, we can't find any Sesame Street DVD in Malaysia & if there is any, the price will be around RM 80 (USD 20.00). That's when I logged on to Amazon.com & purchased it. Now she has gradually developed big interest in watching the DVD. The only dissatisfaction I have is that the captioning doesn't appear (only the subtitle appears). The captioning is good for impaired-hearing people & kids to learn about reference to situation (eg. ""chattering"", ""laughing""). I've bought few DVDs from Amazon before (eg.

3107,3,0738920762,"I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones.
So, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips!  The opening song ""That's How The Numbers Go"" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)
Although there is one good clip - ""Martian Beauty #9,"" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.  Instead, you get the lukewarm ""#11 rap,"" which shows pictures of 11 things, and ""Five Jive with Elmo Hammer,"" which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.

This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.

She loves Ernie and Elmo, both of whom appear regularly in the show, and while she still isn't saying her numbers, I'm pretty sure she's getting the concepts figured out. I also make sure to interact with her to help reinforce the concepts and help keep her focused.
Even though I've watched it with her for at least half of those viewings, I generally enjoy watching it with her. Part of the reason is the different segments are well-done and actually have the occassional bit of adult humor (e.g., the ""counting crows"" who sing about 3 -- supposedly the source for the band's name), and also for the things that happen in the background as Ernie interacts with Benny and the Dinger (for instance, when Ernie dings the Dinger for the first time, watch the action in the background -- it's quite funny, and definitely targeted for the adults who are watching along!).",1012780800,4,1036,4.697802197802198

The great thing(imo) is that Elmo has only a small bit, and this video has firmly lodged Ernie as his absolute favorite Sesame Street Character!!!
