5007090,5,B006N8GNUE,"My daughter has watched this movie several times. She enjoys it and it keeps her attention. That was not the case when she was 2 or a young 3. Now that she is nearly 4 years old, and she has been to ballet class she's discovered Angelina. This particular 1 hour Angelina ""movie"" is of particular interest to me. Toward the end, it introduces Ramayana, the story of a Hindu god. They do an Indian inspired dance. My daughter is watching as I type this and she is trying to do the dance. It's just adorable. I grew up knowing very little about the history and culture of India. It is a fantastic opportunity for my children to have stories like these introduced. It even shows one character with a comic book called Rama. I checked and amazon sells these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ramayana/dp/8172763654/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ramayana</a>. I want to teach my children about world religions and knowing that there is a kid friendly resource like those comic books and an introduction on a show like this one makes me happy.

8501263,5,B006N8GNUE,"Angelina Ballerina by Charlotte Spencer was first introduced to my granddaughter and me in a book. We read the book over and over. Now, we have the film, and my granddaughter is enchanted with it.  Like other little girls, Angelina as a ballerina brings home the story when your own girl is taking ballerina classes. Angelina is a wonderfully animated film, and we live her in this household.

Angelina is becoming a ballerina. She and her friends are taking classes and are practicing for a recital. Angelina is a lovely young girl and has wonderful friends, but she does get into trouble as every child. In this film the singing, dancing and music is so invigorating. My granddaughter would get up and dance in front of the television. Then she would ask me to join her. What fun. In this film, a part if India is discovered, and a song and dance incorporated into their program along with their friend, Marc. We loved this film, and my granddaughter watches it over and over.
