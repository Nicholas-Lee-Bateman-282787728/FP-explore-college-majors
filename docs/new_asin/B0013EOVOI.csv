8250478,1,B0013EOVOI,"This is one of the worst TV episode collections EVER.  I bought it because I wanted to see the episode that later morphed into Lucy In London.  Unfortunately, the Lucy/London episode here is far from the heart and fun of the TV London movie.

But I digress.  This is the worse collection ever because:
1.  No intros or credits for the episodes.  Just a bunch of scenes strung together.  Sometimes it is hard to sense where one episode ended and the other began.
2.  Missing the true ""classics"" (although not really memorable, just the better episodes), especially the early ones with co-star Vivian Vance.
3.  Video quality is mediocre.  No effort made on improving the run-downish condition of the tapes these were obviously copied from.

Such a big contrast with the Alfred Hitchcock DVDs, where intros are the same as when broadcast and the video quality is surprisingly crisp.",1365897600,,880,4.8389261744966445
8250479,3,B0013EOVOI,"The same old recycled ""public domain"" episodes of THE LUCY SHOW...  Just about every single budget-line DVD company you can think of has trundled out these shows.  Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased the episodes over and over again, but for new viewers looking to introduce themselves to the hilarity of Lucy's world, this is a good place to start.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success. THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York. The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Lucy and John Wayne"" - Lucy barges onto the set of John Wayne's latest film whilst running some errands for the bank.

""Mooney the Monkey"" - Overworked Lucy is convinced that an escaped monkey in the bank is actually Mr. Mooney!  Guest starring Janos Prohaska.

""Lucy Meets the Berles"" - While on loan to do some secretarial work for Milton Berle, Lucy suspects the comedian of having an affair with actress Ruta Lee.

""The Efficiency Expert"" - Phil Silvers guest stars as an overzealous efficiency expert, who finds an adept pupil in Lucy.

""Lucy Gets Trapped"" - Skipping work to attend a department store sale backfires horribly for Lucy, when she's photographed in the following day's paper!

""Lucy Meets the Law"" - A shopping trip dissolves into a nightmare for Lucy when she's mistakenly arrested as notorious shoplifter 'The Red Flash'.

""Lucy Gets a Roommate"" - Mousy librarian Carol Bradford (special guest star Carol Burnett) seems like the perfect flatmate...

""Lucy and Carol in Palm Springs"" - With the tempting offer of a free vacation, Lucy joins Carol and her musical act for an engagement at a golfing tournament.

""Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower"" - Believing the job to be a piece of cake, Lucy fires a plumber who's been secretly recruited to install a shower unit in the boys' bedroom.",1283558400,,2162,4.7924528301886795
8250480,3,B0013EOVOI,"There are no opening or closing credits for any of the episodes.
So this DVD is just a collection of scenes, one after the other non-stop.
The back of the case has three photos of Lucy with Carol Burnett, but Carol Burnett is NOT featured in any of the episodes.
